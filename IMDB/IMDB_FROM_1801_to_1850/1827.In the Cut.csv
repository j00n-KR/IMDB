0,SnoopyStyle,intriguing character without thrills,6,23 October 2016,Frannie Avery (Meg Ryan) is a New York City high school English teacher. She is hounded by her ex John Graham. Her half-sister best friend Pauline (Jennifer Jason Leigh) pursues a married man. Frannie meets her student Cornelius Webb at a bar where she becomes entranced by a woman giving oral sex in the back room. Detective Malloy (Mark Ruffalo) interviews her about a body part left outside her window. She fantasizes about Malloy who asks about the incident at the bar. Richard Rodriguez is Malloy's foul-mouthed police partner.Meg Ryan was trying to play against her romantic type casting. She is at least able to achieve that. Filmmaker Jane Campion delivers a indie-verier erotic thriller although the thrills don't get there. Frannie is a disconnected and fractured character. The movie is able accentuate that concept but it does need more paranoia in order for the thrills to land. The murky weird stuff in her character is great but the movie falls flat overall. The plot simply does not move enough.,In the Cut
1,claudio_carvalho,Cheap Erotic Thriller,4,10 December 2004,"In New York, the lonely English teacher Frannie Avery (Meg Ryan) collects sentences, sayings and new slang in English as a passionate hobby. Her half-sister Pauline (Jennifer Jason Leigh) is an unstable woman, and they are close friends. When a young woman is decapitated in Frannie's garden, the police detective Malloy (Mark Ruffalo) visits Frannie investigating the murder and they have an erotic affair. Meanwhile, the unknown serial killer commits other crimes, and Frannie becomes afraid of Malloy at the same time she desires him. I do not know what happened with Meg Ryan: Is she in the end of career? Does she want to destroy her image of ""America's Sweetheart""? Is she training to make a movie with Richard Grieco, Angie Everhart, Stephen Baldwin, Shannon Tweed, Maria Ford and other icons of ""erotic thriller"" genre? I really did not understand why she accepted to work in this movie. The camera is horrible, looking like a soap opera and staying a few seconds focusing the face of an actor or actress or a location, with millions of cuts and without any sequence longer than a few seconds. The plot is so simple and silly that has to explore an explicit free oral sex scene in the beginning of the movie and lots of bad language, contrasting with the correct use of the English language by the character of Frannie, to make some sort of difference. I saw this movie in an American DVD, and at least there is a slang dictionary, with the use of unusual expressions and words that I found interesting to learn some new slang in English. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""Em Carne Viva"" (""In Live Flesh"")",In the Cut
2,jboothmillard,In the Cut,4,11 December 2010,"I only heard about this film when it was mentioned on the most excruciating interview with the leading actress and Sir Michael Parkinson, just a load of one-word answers and icy stares, but I had to see if there was anything worth talking about, from director Jane Campion (The Piano). Basically in New York a young woman has been murdered, and the gruesome event has happened very near the neighbourhood of lonely teacher Frannie Avery (Meg Ryan). Investigating the murder is the man she thought she saw getting a blowjob on the night it happened, Detective Giovanni A. Malloy (Mark Ruffalo), and soon enough they get close to each other. Murders continue in the area, and the not all right sexual liaisons carry on too, and she may in fact be in danger as some of the clues lead to Malloy having some involvement. Also in danger of the possibly guilty Malloy is Frannie's half-sister Pauline (Jennifer Jason Leigh), of course the affair has to come to an end when suspicions are too high, and in the end Frannie does indeed have to face threat head on. Also starring Nick Damici as Detective Ritchie Rodriguez, Sharrieff Pugh as Cornelius Webb and Kevin Bacon as John Graham. I agree with the critics, Ryan is alright, the sexual stuff and nudity is all fine, but the story is too predictable and it doesn't grip you, not a great erotic crime suspense thriller. Okay!",In the Cut
3,rmax304823,Professional murder mystery.,7,18 November 2009,"It's an old-fashioned plot at heart. A young woman is a witness to, or in some other way involved in, a murder. A detective enters the picture. The attraction is immediate. But as one suspicious incident after another unfolds, one of them comes to believe the other is the murderer.This is all seen from the point of view of the woman, Meg Ryan, as a lonely and desperately horny New York teacher. Usually, it's the other way around, with the detective as the central figure, as in ""Laura"" or ""Basic Instinct."" The homicide detective is Marc Ruffalo. He's Ryan's dream boat. He's rough-hewn and dark, uses street language and talks dirty to her, but he's soft spoken, compassionate, and frank. And he has a crude but sometimes fey wit. After he discovers Ryan is an English teacher, he tries to get the spelling of someone's name correctly. ""Cornelius Webb,"" he says. ""Is that with two Bs or not two Bs?"" Not the kind of guy who would ever cry in front of someone, though. Too masculine for that. He's also a terrific lover, concerned first about her pleasure, and he's gentle.Well, the plot may be formulaic but the execution is original enough. The first thing one notices is the lighting and photography of New York City and its appointments. That would be Dion Beebe's bailiwick. The images are gorgeous without being excessively decorative. The set decoration is by Andrew Baseman. Everything seems all rose and green and amber. If it were any better done -- if there were billowing scarlet curtains -- it could be a soft porn movie. The Sound Department should get its share of applause too: ticking clocks, chimes, and the most convincing rumble of traffic on the overhead GWB that I've ever heard.The intentionality behind the images is feminine. The director, Jane Campion, lends the film some insight into how women speak and behave off stage that a male director might have missed either our of ignorance or plain old disregard. When Ryan and her sister, Jennifer Jason Leigh in the film's best performance, enter a coffee shop they order a decaf double latte with Devon cream or something equally fancy. (One wonders how the slightly brutish sensibilities of the homicide detective will fit into this cozy picture, what with his preferring raw coffee out of a paper cup.) The two sisters talk about relationships. Neither seems to care about her work or her career. They're alone and they suffer. They think about marriage and babies. Ryan weeps frequently while discussing her emotions. Ryan also has three guys lusting after her, not including the killer who disassembles his victims. That fantasy is to women what the conquering hero fantasy is to men.Campion wisely has made a kind of gender crossover movie. Yes, it's all intimately seen from a woman's point of view but there is always that gory murder business lurking in the shadows to keep the men interested, not to mention some explicit fellatio (not involving Ryan), considerable nudity of both male and female, and some compelling simulated sex. I must say I didn't particularly care for the moaning and gasping of Ryan's heavenly orgasm. Not that I minded her getting off, but that it made me wonder about my own prowess. For the same reason I kind of disliked the Ruffalo character. What's he got that I ain't got? What makes the Hottentot so hot? The identity of the murderer comes as a bit of a surprise but the way the plot spells it out leaves nothing in doubt about the outcome. Strictly by the numbers, Ryan becomes aware of the fact that the guy she's with is the notorious disarticulator of women. Still, the execution of the scene is highly innovative. We don't see the final shooting. There's a high overhead shot of a dead body lying atop a live one. And the dead body never springs back to life! The camera is often hand held and it wobbles, and this has become such a cliché, especially in dumbed-down action movies, that it's a little irritating, but here the camera's movements are modest and appropriate to the setting -- a jolting subway train, for instance.I like the thing. Smoothly done.",In the Cut
4,moonspinner55,Woozy psycho-sexual thriller isn't preoccupied with logic or even with being seamless...,6,9 July 2006,"Half-baked, underwritten crime drama-cum-sexual thriller has Meg Ryan playing mousy English teacher in NYC attracted to a handsome homicide investigator on a serial murder case, one that has left body parts in Ryan's yard (and yet this barely fazes her!). Sub-plots involving Ryan's half-sister (Jennifer Jason Leigh, trying hard with a bad part), ex-boyfriend (an unbilled Kevin Bacon), her students, her job, and her fetish for the English vocabulary go absolutely nowhere. Meg, trying for an understated seriousness--but mostly just looking unhappy--gives a fairly brave and intriguing performance, and it's interesting to see her in these jittery, sordid surroundings, but the plot is alternately off-putting and curiously morbid; it's a fascinating misfire. Nicole Kidman co-produced (and perhaps was in line to star in the film herself), but Ryan does as good a job as any actress might have in the role. **1/2 from ****",In the Cut
5,blanche-2,strange,5,1 July 2015,"Meg Ryan stars in this Jane Campion film, ""In the Cut"" from 2003. The film includes Jennifer Jason Leigh, Mark Ruffalo, Kevin Bacon, and Nick Damici.Ryan is very Jane Fonda-esque here, playing an English teacher, Frannie Avery, who becomes involved with a detective (Ruffalo) as he is investigating a murder case. The only problem is that Frannie is a little bit suspicious of him - she thinks he might have done it due to something she saw the day of the murder.This film is dark, gritty, erotic, and sleazy, with characters that aren't likable, mostly because they're not really fleshed out. I can't say I was very involved in it or compelled by it at all. There isn't a huge amount of dialogue, and the performances of Ryan and Ruffalo are low key. Ryan in particular is very good; I thought Ruffalo was a little one-note.A lot of the background of Frannie and her half-sister Pauline (Leigh) is given in short blips -- what happened to their mutual father, Pauline's relationship with a doctor -- every so often we are given a hint. I'd like to know why they both lived in such cruddy places.The entire atmosphere of this film is dirty and depressing, the real mean streets. If you like your films that way, you may like this.",In the Cut
6,edwagreen,In the Cut- A Real Rip Off *,3,11 February 2011,"Another winner from director Jane Campion. She was the one who gave us ""The Piano"" in 1993. This ""In the Cut"" is equally bad. Painfully slow moving, this tells the story of a promiscuous writing teacher who lives near a recently committed murder and begins an affair with a police officer, Mark Ruffalo, who is investigating the killing. She begins to suspect Ruffalo as the killer. She meets with her half-sister and in a scene totally unrelated to this bomb of a film,recounts to her how her father got dumped on a skating rink by his fiancée and immediately proposed to another. This is totally off the wall.Then one of her students is arrested for the killing. Her own half-sister winds up dead, and then eventually we realize that Ryan has made a mistake in thinking that Ruffalo is the killer. Who the real killer is is no surprise. The only surprising thing here is how bad this film really is.",In the Cut
7,michaelRokeefe,Erotic and dark. A real need of a cop.,6,10 August 2008,"A very peculiar role choice for everyone's darling Meg Ryan. You definitely see her in a different light. Nothing real wrong with choosing a movie in which you show skin and masturbate a couple of times. I found those sequences more erotic than the actual sex scenes. IN THE CUT has a not too predictable twist; but time wise may be a little long in the tooth. Anxiety is prevalent.Ryan plays Frannie,a High School English teacher in New York City, and is also working on a book of Black slang getting tips from one of her students, Cornelius(Sharrieff Pugh). During a research meeting in a bar, Frannie makes a trip to the basement restrooms and ends up spying on a man being pleasured orally. The next morning the girl involved is found slaughtered and Detective Malloy(Mark Ruffalo)is at Frannie's door investigating. Frannie's attraction to the dark side has her in a progressive lustful affair with Malloy. The relationship gets hotter; and Frannie notices that Malloy has the same tattoo as that of the man she spied on earlier. Sex is sex; lust is lust. Frannie's fears do not put a halt to her continuing carnal knowledge.Also in the cast: Jennifer Jason Leigh, Nick Damici, Nancy La Scala, and a weird bit part for Kevin Bacon, who has no qualms with quirky roles.",In the Cut
8,jotix100,When Frannie meets Malloy,7,10 November 2003,"Jane Campion the director of this film seems to be telling this story from a woman's point of view. In her take of Susanna Moore's novel, Ms. Campion's emphasis is about the state of mind of Frannie. The impression one gets is that the director is more interested in how the sordid surroundings where Fran lives, in a seedy section of Manhattan, plays in the story.
We are giving a clue at the beginning of the film when Fran witnesses a very erotic scene in the basement of the bar she has gone with one of her students. She cannot get it out of her erotic mind. In fact that scene is a key to the character of this sexually repressed woman. It also brings a new dimension to films in which this aspect is only allowed to men to have erotic fantasies, but at no time can a woman be permitted the same.The crime that is being investigated at the beginning comes to haunt Frannie, played by Meg Ryan. She meets the detectives working the case and falls  for Malloy with such abandon that it comes as no surprise. Meg Ryan shows she can play this woman. Her scenes with Mark Ruffalo are very explicit. Luckily, Jennifer Jason Leigh doesn't have much to do. Her Pauline is not a very vivid character in the film version; one wonders if these two are really sisters.After all is said and done, had it not been for the involvement of Ms Campion this film would have been given a different treatment. It is to her credit that it has stayed true to the original text.",In the Cut
9,preppy-3,The only movie I walked out on,1,6 June 2006,"Drab, dreary movie about Meg Ryan (who seems to be sleepwalking) having an affair with police officer Mark Ruffalo while someone is murdering young women...or something like that. I was so bored I'm not sure! The film is (supposedly) shot in muted color and Ryan used her own hair color (brown) and DOESN'T play a perky cute woman. She plays the exact opposite--someone drab, dreary and BORING!!! Ruffalo (a good actor) doesn't fare much better. The film is slow, the story uninteresting and everybody seems to be sedated. It's also shot with a hand-held camera making the whole film look jerky and out of focus (there was one car ride with Ryan and Ruffalo that was virtually unwatchable). I realize Ryan was trying to change her image in this movie but she made a bad choice. Going from one extreme to the other is jarring. She even has a surprising nude scene.I usually sit through anything but this movie was putting me to sleep and the jerky camera-work was making me nauseous. I walked out after an hour (I wasn't the only one). A must miss.",In the Cut

11,dbborroughs,Twaddle,3,20 January 2008,"Meg Ryan in Jane ""I'm over rated"" Campion's thriller about a repressed woman involved with a detective looking into a killing in her neighborhood. Arty moody desperate to seem about something I desperately wanted to watch another Garpar Noe (Irreversible) film where it may be all flash and misdirection but at least there is more honesty than there is here. Mark Ruffalo, an actor who's ability escapes me, is the detective and seems more and more wrong as the movie goes on. I think the pretentious twaddle is best summed up by the notion of a blood drenched woman wandering down busy streets with no one saying anything. It looks interesting but is just bs.I do recommend the second shot of the film, a black an white mural on Lafayette Street in Manhattan that I spent the better part of a half hour oogling and photographing while waiting for friend to finish up at the comic convention.",In the Cut
12,lastliberal,Boring soft-core porn,4,14 July 2007,"Boring, just plain boring. It's all I can really say and all that needs to be said.Even the thought of seeing Meg Ryan in more than some cutesy romantic role was painful. This was just a boring story with some sex scenes and lots of pointless dirty talk sprinkled in. It moved through the system like a octopus stew.Jane Campion needs to keep shining all those awards she got for The Piano, because if she does any more like this, it will be all she has to look at.Mark Ruffalo? What a waste. And, what is with this guitar-playing detective? Don't they have work to do.This was just a waste of film.",In the Cut
13,christopher-underwood,Fabulous and much maligned gem,10,23 November 2020,"Fabulous and much maligned gem, so overlooked and underrated that I had to get my Blu-ray from Germany. I believe I originally saw this at the cinema but remembered little other than how powerful and uncompromising it was. Well, I got that right, this is thrilling, erotic and intelligently engaging throughout. I had to double check the running time as recovered from the emotional onslaught, but yes this does run two hours but is so tight and persuasive that there is not a single lull. The early scene in the bar basement is more explicit than I recall and may have been cut for the cinema release I saw, but certainly sets things up and with the specific tattoo link ensures you are kept upon the edge of your seat for the duration. Sometimes deceptively mundane as with Jennifer Jason Leigh and her boyfriend worries but even here there is an edge as we juggle the ingredients including the fact she lives above a strip joint and the boyfriend is a doctor with family. Meg Ryan's character is more nuanced with men friend complications of her own and as if her New York flat location is not down and dirty enough, albeit with a glorious garden, murder and mayhem seems to constantly impinge upon her ragged life. Jane Campion deals with the Susanna Moore book brilliantly and the street scenes with an emphasis on the busted street furniture, flickering neon and glaring graffiti is all equally reflective of the thrills and spills of city life. Also the whole complicated business of love and sex and death on the streets is vividly and bravely exposed to view in a tense and excitingly dangerous portrayal of desire and the contradictory forces of want and need.",In the Cut
14,whpratt1,Erortic Film,6,6 January 2008,"This film is fully of curse words and scenes with erotic sex and constant love making. Jennifer Jason Leigh, (Pauline) plays the role of the sister to Meg Ryan, (Frannie) who is a New York writing professor who happens to witness a couple performing oral sex with each other and she identifies a tattoo with the symbol of Theee of Clubs on his wrist. This girl who is performing oral sex is found cut up into pieces and a murder investigation takes place and Detective Rodriguez, ( Nick Damier) investigates this case. It just so happens that Detective Rodriquez also has a tattoo very similar to the killer's wrist. Frannie has an erotic affair with Rodriquez and just can't seem to leave him alone for one minute to rest. There is plenty of mystery, suspense and very romantic scenes and horrible language.

I think this movie just left you with more questions than entertainment and that was the problem. It seemed so strange the way most of the characters were acting, it was like all of them could have been the mysterious killer. Even Meg! Meg Ryan, that sweet little blonde from When Harry Met Sally got naked! I'm not sure if that was the best career move, and her lips took the movie over, not her acting ability. I don't know what was with this movie, but I'm not even too sure on what to say about it, so please be forgiving IMDb users! I'm tired! 5/10",In the Cut
16,=G=,I don't want what she's having!,6,13 February 2004,"In ""In the Cut"", Ryan plays a teacher who lives in a low rent NYC hood, spends time hanging out with low lifes, makes notes of things she reads in subways, gets turned on by angry sex, has the personality of a zombie, and becomes embroiled in a slasher mystery with a detective working on the case. A sort of sex/slasher character study/mystery/thriller, ""In The Cut"" is just another Campion misfire though she works the camera well and conjures solid performances from her actors even if the characters aren't particularly believable. She also has an annoying penchant for cutaways or backflashes which serve only to confuse and detract and, when all is said and done, delivers an average product according to critics, the public, and film fest judges. Forgettable stuff only for the curious. (C+)",In the Cut
17,sol1218,Cuts Both Ways,7,25 December 2004,"***SPOILER ALERT*** Meg Ryan drops her bubbly and perky image in the movie ""In The Cut"" to do some very serious acting as high school English teacher Fannie Avery. In this murder mystery/drama set in the Sho-Ho section of Manhattan. Ariving home one afternoon to her apartment Fannie runs into police Det. Malloy, Mark Ruffalo, who's canvasing her building. Det. Malloy is trying to find out if anyone saw or heard a murder being committed in back of the building where she lives the night before. The woman who was murdered was also dismembered and the police feel that there's a psycho killer on the loose and that he'll definitely strike again if he's not caught soon. Fannie tells Det. Malloy that she was asleep at the time that the murder was committed and couldn't help him in the case. The next day Fannie is picked up by Det. Malloy and his partner Det. Rodriguez, Nick Damici, for more questioning on the murder. There's the fact that she was seen at the ""Red Turtle"" bar at the same time that the murder victim was last seen alive. This strangely rings a bell with Fannie since she was at the bar and did see the woman who was murdered. But she also may have seen her killer and the killer may well be one of the detectives who's interviewing her,Det. Malloy. Jane Campion the director of ""In The Cut"" throws into the movie an obvious ""Red Herring"" by having Fannie's former boyfriend John, Kevin Bacon, stalking her throughout the entire film. It's easy to see that John is only a flake with serious emotional problems but not the clever and maniacal killer in the movie. Champion does cleverly throw in a ""Red Lighthouse"" that we see a number of times in the movie. Especially in the scene where Fannie is teaching her students about English Literature that has a lot to do with the ending of the film even though it doesn't revile who the killer is.Fannie is later attacked by what may very well be the murderer but gets away. That has Det. Malloy get more involved with her since it seems that she somehow may be able to recognize him since he went out of his way to murder her. At the same time Fannie feel that it's Det Malloy himself who's the killer and want's to do her in to prevent her from identifying him. This leads to a strange and weird relationship between the two with Fannie having to depend on Det. Malloy's protection where at the same time feels that he may at any moment murder her. The killings continue with a woman found chopped to pieces and stuffed into a washer-dryer at a neighborhood laundromat. The killings get even more personal when Fannie's half-sister Pauline, Jennifer Jason Leigh, is found brutally murdered and dismembered in her apartment. Just when you, and Fannie, think you know who's behind the killings and the killer is about to be caught and arrested the film turns upside down! You then realize that the person who you think is about to save Fannie from her crazed and dangerous pursuer is the one who's out to murder her. Even though the movie lags in some places it still holds your interests right until the final credits. Meg Ryan is almost unrecognizable as Fannie Avery but thats what made the movie so effective. You took it as a serious murder/drama instead of a light comedy that you would have expected it to be with her staring in it.",In the Cut
18,paul2001sw-1,Disturbing but unpleasant,6,29 September 2008,"Jane Campion is a skilled film-maker, and 'In the Cut' positively bristles with a dark sexual menace, as well as containing a surprisingly un-fluffy performance from Meg Ryan in the lead role. At it's best, it reminded me of 'Don't Look Now', with its mounting sense of inevitable tragedy set against the backdrop of a city that seems both alive and hostile. And yet, somehow I didn't enjoy watching this movie - perhaps because it is simply so unpleasant. The movie contains the usual improbabilities of any serial killer film, and although these are artistically disguised, the film paints a peculiarly unappealing picture of a world where sexual obsession leads to murder and death. Compared with a realist police drama like 'The Wire', 'In the Cut' portrays a world with heightened atmosphere, but a nastier core, and this is very clearly a deliberate choice on Campion's part (and, it should be noted, only one step on from her depiction of elemental sexuality in 'The Piano'). All I can say is that I admired this film; but I didn't really like it.",In the Cut
19,MOscarbradley,"File next to ""Klute""",6,16 October 2008,"A flawed, minor work from Jane Campion but fascinating, nevertheless. Campion was almost certainly not the write person to handle this psycho-sexual thriller, more prone to hard-boiled misogynist red-herrings rather than overt feminist leanings, despite an almost all female team in the production, writing and directing departments.In many respects it's a film to file next to ""Klute"", even if Meg Ryan is no Bree Daniels or certainly no Jane Fonda, (and still it's probably the best acting she's ever done). Where Fonda's Bree was a hooker with a English Professor's intelligence, Ryan is an English Professor with a hooker's sensibility. Fonda fell for Sutherland's investigating Private Eye; Ryan falls for Mark Ruffalo's sexist pig of an investigating cop who may or may not be the murderer. (Ryan seems to think he is but likes his kind of rough sex, all the same).It's a film that pushes most of the right buttons, (all the performances, particularly Ruffalo's, are first-rate, it's superbly shot by Dion Beebe and there are enough potential suspects to keep us guessing up to the climax), without making us care very much about the protagonists. Despite being one half of the writing team, (the other being Susanna Moore, adapting her own novel), Campion directs as if on auto-pilot. Without wanting to sound sexist, this is a movie that cries out for a Lumet, (if only to get the New York feel right), or even a Walter Hill. In other words, it's a man's movie but one that needs to be tougher than it is; we should feel shaken up by it and we don't. Campion never manages to bestow on the film any kind of female perspective so that, finally, it's just another well-made, mildly entertaining who-done-it.",In the Cut
20,dromasca,"Uncertain genre, still enjoyable",7,10 April 2004,"'In the cut' is hard to classify - erotic thriller, urban drama, mid-age crisis story, horror - it has something of all these, but only at surface. A series of crimes happens somewhere in the New York City area, an English teacher and a policeman become involved in a relationship beyond the detective story. Jane Campion directed better films, and the lack of decision about what the film should be is felt quite badly here. The whole story is filmed intentionally in ugly and dirty locations.  Is any relationship true in this environment? Even the love story seems dirty, seems doomed to failure. It is hard to judge this film. On one side, it is very authentic, the message seems to be that life is dirty, and dreams (or cinema) cannot always cannot always kill its ugliness. On the other hand, the lack of decision about where this film intents to take us leaves us viewers with a feeling of lack of satisfaction. Meg Ryan tries a role very different from the nice girl next door characters she uses to play, and she needs to be careful not to fall in the other extreme.Realism only cannot create a big film, and this one has too many holes - logically and artistically. 7/10 on my personal scale.",In the Cut
21,atlasmb,A Dark Urban Vision,5,8 April 2014,"""In the Cut"" is a film that I think few people would like. First of all, it is populated with unlikable people. Meg Ryan plays Frannie Avery--a woman who has emotional problems. As the film progresses, she seems to become more deeply involved in her own psychological issues. She lives in a New York City that is filmed with a seedy grittiness and she only knows and meets characters who are morally ambiguous or who possess questionable motivations.""In the Cut"" is well filmed. It possesses style and a director's vision. But it frames a world where few would want to go. Frannie becomes involved with Detective Malloy, played by Mark Ruffalo. His job makes him witness to the worst that society has to offer. He is currently working on a series of grisly homicides. Frannie's morbid curiosity exposes her to Malloy's world and taints their relationship, whatever it is.As the film continues, it becomes more about mood than mystery. An ambiguous tone creates a storyline where motives are suspect and suspicions multiply. If the viewer can be content with only mood and style, then this film may satisfy. But I expect most viewers prefer films with a clearer purpose or a ""deeper"" meaning.",In the Cut
22,tabuno,"Tediously Slow, Usual Climax, But Good Acting",6,25 January 2019,"3 November 2003. ""In The Cut"" provides a slow almost painfully tedious, plodding pace of non-action that leads to a rather uninteresting ended or an ending that audience members have seen many times before. The one redeeming value is Meg Ryan's fine acting performance in this movie that demonstrates her talent, but unless, it can't make up for an almost boring movie. Ryan offers up to the audience a serious and deep character role as well as a sensual, erotic (but not trashy) performance. While there was potential for a psychological thriller the script falls to cover up a major flaw in logical investigative insight (overlooking an obvious clue) and sheds little light into flashbacks that aren't used to any effect and leaves the teacher/pupil relationship at loose ends. Overall, Meg for all her powerful performance can't save this movie from becoming just another ordinary detective mystery (that isn't really that thrilling). Six out of ten stars.",In the Cut
23,kenjha,Embarrassingly Bad,2,2 March 2013,"A sexually frustrated school teacher becomes involved with a cop investigating a series of murders. Ryan tries to shed her good girl image but manages to only shed her clothes. She seems to have had too much work done on her face, which is rather distracting. Speaking of distracting, the direction is horrible, with the shaking camera and ugly framing constantly calling attention away from the story - not that there is much going on of interest in the story anyway. Campion is responsible for the poor direction as well as the lousy screenplay. The plot is lacking in narrative flow and the dialog is embarrassingly bad. Ruffalo is usually worth watching, but he can't do much with his undeveloped character. Leigh comes off best.",In the Cut
24,sol-,My extended review of the film,7,19 January 2005,"Many people out there do not understand the difference between the Best Picture and Best Director Oscar. After all, if the director is responsible for making sure all the elements mix well together, then surely Best Director should be the same as Best Picture? Well that is not quite the case, as far as I understand it. The writing of the film, or the story itself, is at least the main thing that a director does not have complete control of. There are other elements too of course. But the reason why it is so hard to explain the difference to people is that it is rare to come across a film that is well directed but nothing much else. However, 'In the Cut' is an example of such a film.The plot is a thriller about some serial killer who is killing young women. Sound familiar yet? However there is a (pseudo) erotic romance involved too. Our protagonist is an outgoing female, but yet one with weaknesses. The storyline revolves around a primarily sexual relationship that she starts with a detective investigating the case, however all along she suspects that he is the killer, because she saw someone with the same tattoo receiving oral sex from one of the murder victims. I won't reveal the rest of the plot, which may sound slightly original, but yet I can reassure you it is quite hackneyed in the execution.The film is based on a novel written by Susannah Moore, which I am yet to read, and after seeing the film adaptation, I am in no mood to. Campion takes to writing the screenplay, but helped along by Moore. In 1993, Campion did a superb job writing 'The Piano', for which she received a well-deserved Oscar. The characters in the film were all interesting and well developed, and the story was no difficulty to understand. It was also quite original. The material for this movie however revolves around a familiar plot that has a thriller element. More time in the script is dedicated therefore towards the thriller  and romance  aspects of the story, and less towards the drama. That's not to say that the characters are poorly developed or anything, but it does not help. The main problem with the writing of the film is the story itself. It has so many familiar elements and at times it is predictable and clichéd.The acting is not much better than ordinary either. Ryan has a few good moments, but is often over-the-top. The rest of the cast is, well, satisfactory, but nothing special, give or take Kevin Bacon. However Bacon's character is perhaps the most questionable one of the lot. So if the writing and acting in the film is ordinary, can it be a great film? Not really. How then, one might wonder, is it well directed? Campion is a very good director. She knows exactly how to direct a film to give it the right atmosphere and make it look good. In the Cut is one of the best-looking thrillers I've seen of this decade. As in 'The Portrait of a Lady', Campion demonstrates an acute eye for colour and light in the film. The execution is very polished. On a surface level it does not look like a cheap Hollywood film. It does not look like a vehicle for Ryan or any of her co-stars. Kudos especially goes to Campion's vision of the flashbacks used in the film, which are reminiscent of the vignettes Kidman's worldwide voyages in 'The Portrait of a Lady'. Even Campion's use of black and white aids the visual style.This is certainly one of the most unique films I have come across, but I don't say that in an overly positive manner. It is a very good-looking film, and ignoring camera angles and editing techniques, it still looks very solid on a visual scope. There is plenty to admire about Campion's direction of the film, but under this polished surface that Campion has created lies an ordinary, predictable, clichéd and only semi-interesting thriller. It is a film worth seeing to admire Campion's craft as a director, but the film is otherwise rather unrewarding, though it surely will still keep one watching until maybe the last ten minutes.",In the Cut
25,Dr_Coulardeau,A good cop has to be profiled as unsentimental,8,7 November 2006,"A good thriller but lacking the police expertise we expect from thrillers today. It all hinges on one detail that the main woman knows and does not communicate to the main cop : a tattoo that this main cop wears. She is of course right to believe this is a detail that identifies the killer, but she is wrong because there is nothing more or less common than one particular tattoo. And she causes at least one death and puts herself in jeopardy. The rhythm of the film is intense and intensely punctuated with sex, or sexually explicit scenes, though they remain tamed in spite of this explicitness. The point is to know why she makes this mistake of not telling the cop the element that identifies the killer. Because she thinks that particular cop is the criminal ? That's too simple. In fact there is in her the common reaction that leads most people to not telling the cops what they know because they do not trust them, what's more if there is something ambiguous about one particular cop. But that has to be still a lot more deeper with this particular girl. She is typical of a mature woman in one big city like New York : to be autonomous and independent from men, not to be afraid of anything, particularly danger, etc. In a word to keep one's business to oneself, one's thoughts secret and one's doubts or suspicion unrevealed. This kind of internalized feeling and attitude of independence and freedom can become extremely dangerous, particularly for women, and that is the message of the film. Luckily she had the gun of her cop-friend at the right minute and time. But besides this warning to women, the police work of the film is reduced to little because of this coyness that blocks any kind of standard police investigation : it is true that if the cop had known that little detail the case would have been closed in about two quarters of one hour, i.e. in ten minutes on the screen.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",In the Cut
26,johnnyboyz,"Spotty and often trudging exercise in style over substance; glum, well shot cinematography and some tough other scenes handled well not amounting to an awful lot.",5,22 September 2011,"And there I was thinking In the Cut might have had something to do with the sport of Golf – how wrong I was. Accomplished film maker Jane Campion is in the chair for said film, an involving for-the-first-act thriller which mutates into something deeply problematic and then just mutates further still into something quite unpleasant. The piece aims for, and borrows from, both the heights as well as bits and pieces from all of Bad Lieutenant; Naked and Basic Instinct to varying extents – needless to say, falling rather short of each of those examples. The usual suspects, in the form of content and conventions, are all here; certain grizzly murders act as catalysts to propel people together, one of whom is an overconfident police detective assigned to the case, whose own moral codes constantly appear blurred, in-between coming into contact with a middle aged woman he cannot quite get a lock on and whose own plight is one of a flitting, scattered nature as she hurls herself through a series of dangerous, Hellish encounters.Meg Ryan, well away from what many might refer to as her more usual or more ""frothier"" roles, plays the lead character; a woman named Frannie who occupies a dingy New York City apartment in an area seemingly bathed in crime and graffiti. She lives with her sister, the younger and far less advanced Pauline (Jason-Leigh); the mornings starting in colour-starved, dimly lit cinematography for the women and seeing Pauline, in-between doing what she needs to do for breakfast, limply peering out at a neighbouring Chinese man across the street inhabiting his own place. Her gaze is captured - the insinuation of a lack of men, both living with them and then later revealed to generally exist in their lives, becoming apparent. There is a male presence in Frannie's life of sorts, but it is that of the unhinged John Graham, played with a delicious mix of farce and menace by Kevin Bacon, who's highly feminine in his appearance and a jumpy, jittery guy seemingly a step away from being a total loon. He is, quite remarkably, and aside from being the best thing about the film, responsible for the single best scene during which he attempts to sell Frannie his pet dog. Given the bulk of what happens in In the Cut, that is saying something.Frannie teaches for a living, an Erin Gruwell-type figure working with the underprivileged and potentially hostile in this locale of urbane decay. She teaches, she tutors and is able to drive these exchanges with these sorts of people; the woman additionally is frank and unafraid to speak on a variety of things, someone who's blunt in her definition, to her sister no less, on certain parts of the female's body. If all was not necessarily well both economically and sociologically with the part of town in which the sisters live, things get a mite worse when a murder happens in the area; this bringing Mark Ruffalo's police detective, Giovanni Malloy, into proceedings and closer to Frannie's life when he shows up on her doorstep wanting to ask some questions. When we first see him, Malloy smokes in that way which makes smoking look good; in that distinct way people, whom eventually take up the habit, most probably saw and fell in love at that early stage. He comes off as being fairly cool and is, amidst the filth and aesthetical degradation we've so far encountered, undeniably handsome in this regard.When they first meet, it is he whom waits on the apartment stairs and in a physical position of being above her, although it is Frannie keeping him out of her dwelling and under control as she checks up on his authenticity. Their ties come to drive the film; later, drinks at a local bar are peppered by an internal performer and her lyrics on how one ought to be wary of certain partners and that, more often than not, they're ""no good"" for you – alarm bells ought to be ringing but we're not into the film enough for them to resonate. The piece dissolves into something within which there is very little talk of anything at all; proceedings peppered with frank, sexual encounters rearing up on the odd occasion. Around this, a rather dire plot to do with whom the killer actually is, and whose life is actually in danger, makes itself more and more known. Despite being a teacher and a woman with words, the character of Frannie is largely fatuous and feels both undercut and underwritten; her life, and life situation, is clumsily summarised every so often by the advertisements on the roof of the subway alluding to disorientation and isolation.Where we sense we ought to be observing a powerful chapter in her life in which she seems to have found a man; is treading perilously close to the edge and is finally having the city catch up with her after having avoided such a thing for so many years, the whole thing just comes off as a bad slasher sequel. The narrative is equivalent to that of a motor engine running on fumes, the lead darting here and there as various crazies enter and then leave her life again tiring; story structure and audience envelopment in a plot largely vacant with, it feels, the racier scenes and the racier scenes alone sadly acting as the reason one ought to remain in one's seat with any degree of interest. The film is confrontational and unafraid of holding back on specific content; for that, we acknowledge more-so admire the bravery of the beast, whilst its carrying with it a bleached out atmosphere of little-to-no hope twinned with an overall look of a grubby, grimy nature is dutifully executed, but the congealed whole feels too distorted and scattered to actually get behind.",In the Cut

Meg Ryan a fine actress in the role of a writing teacher. Mmmm! Now writing is one of my favorite hobbies and profession. Jennifer Jason Leigh, who could ever forget her? Was amazing and bedazzling. I liked the part where she gives her sister Frannie(Meg Ryan) the charm bracelet. And knowing more about her father was more interesting by the minute. Now there's these two NYPD Detectives Malloy(Mark Ruffalo) and Rodriguez(Nick Damici). I know Malloy was hard core with Frannie, but he was serious with her at all times. There was a lot of sex, and a lot of nudity. Yep, skin is in! The 3 of spades was noticeable on Malloy, and it made Frannie suspicious of Malloy. Somehow she got sidetracked when his partner had the same tattoo. After getting her hunches wrong, she quickly found out it was Rodriguez, not Malloy, and her sister's death has been avenged. This movie had a lot of common words used in slangs, I wouldn't go that far, I just make up my own slangs and follow along. This is definitely for the writers all over the world, and the USA.

29,MBunge,It made me wonder if I needed new glasses,3,7 July 2011,"This could have been the greatest erotic thriller ever made and no one would have ever noticed because of the thrice-damned nonsense director Jane Campion does here playing around with the focus on her cameras. In The Cut being several light years away from even being a good erotic thriller only makes things worse.Frannie Avery (Meg Ryan) is a New York City English professor. She's the sort of repressed type who gets all quivery over snippets of passionate poetry she sees plastered up in the subway. Frannie has a screwed-up sister (Jennifer Jason Leigh) who's borderline stalking a married man, an unstable ex-boyfriend (Kevin Bacon) with an ugly dog and she's writing a book on urban slang with the help of one of her huge, black students (Sharrieff Pugh). When a woman's severed head is found in the community garden of Frannie's apartment building, she meets Detective Malloy (Mark Ruffalo). The cop has all the sophistication of a walking hard on, so of course he and Frannie fall into bed together. But as more dismembered women show up, Frannie begins to suspect there's more to Malloy than his penis and cheesy mustache.That's about it for the plot of In The Cut. It's one of those willfully idiotic plots where the whole shebang hangs on people not asking painfully obvious questions and avoiding saying the first things that would come to any normal person's mind. Basically, Frannie Avery lolls around, gets screwed, lolls around, gets screwed, lolls around, almost gets killed, fade to black.I don't know what bug crawled up Campion's ass when it came time to make this film, which is one of the most annoying and aggravating movies I've ever watched. Not because the acting is terrible. It isn't. And not because the writing is dreadful, even though it is. It's not even because of the unremitting camera movement that plagues every scene and makes one of them look like it was filmed on top of a 1965 washing machine.No, what dooms In The Cut is exasperating games Campion plays with focus. Virtually ever single shot in the whole flick is out of focus in one way or another. Sometimes things are clear in the middle of the image and the edges are fuzzy. Sometimes the focus goes in and out. Sometimes the background is out of focus, sometimes it's the foreground and sometimes it's the focal point of the shot. Watching this thing is like wearing eyeglasses with the wrong prescription. I'm sure Campion had some point for doing it this way but I don't give two jerks what the reason might be because it wasn't good enough.This movie is also quiet to the point of distraction and so slow that you'll feel like you're watching it on the event horizon of a black hole. Meg Ryan does get naked and there's a bit of fellatio that's more graphic than anything outside The Brown Bunny, but neither will rouse you of the sleepy, weary, apathetic trance you'll fall into after 5 minutes of In The Cut.And don't let Ryan's nudity tempt you. There could be a Sapphic mosh pit in the middle of the movie with Ryan, Jennifer Aniston, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledell and this piece of crap still wouldn't be worth renting.",In the Cut
30,Chris_Docker,One of the under-rated movies of the year,8,11 November 2003,"For some strange reason known only to herself perhaps, Campion agreed voluntary cuts of this movie for the U.S. market. In doing so, key elements were chopped and the film is left wanting - but not so in versions outside the puritanical U.S.The film tells of a schoolteacher and a homicide detective who strike up an affair, but the whole story is told within an increasingly unnerving film noir plot involving a serial killer that cuts up his victims very severely.The interesting aspect that makes the film somewhat different is that we not only see the characters unfold in a way that shows us extremes of mis-perception, but it shows us some of the ways we both deeply perceive and mis-perceive people because of, or through, sexual contexts, and the (extreme) dangers of doing so.(PLOT SPOILERS FOLLOW)The key to the whole movie lies in a kick-oneself scene where the audience fails to take in essential clues because of the distracting nature of very graphic sexual shots (extreme close-ups of an erect penis being fellated). Take this out, as no doubt happened in the American version, and it probably ceases to be anything special.We are constantly invited to mis-read characters. Is Meg Ryan a bit dippy? The opening scenes of the film perhaps suggest a hippy-like airy-fairyness - and, after being invited so to downgrade the character in our own minds we discover that she is a schoolteacher who simply has a passion for words and the everyday poetry of things. Her friend enters the scene, in an apartment above a strip joint - is she a hooker? a topless dancer? They seem so 'friendly' - maybe the seemingly good schoolteacher Meg Ryan is in a lesbian affair with a 'lowlife' woman? Only much later do we discover she is her sister - and such levels of affection (including sharing the same bed) have a more mainstream interpretation; Meg's sister also merely rents the apartment, not works in the sex joint underneath.Similarly Mark Ruffalo's character is a puzzle. Is he a caring cop with a rather (obnoxious) macho streak, or is he something more dangerous? Have we seen him before? What about his buddy?Yet the film eventually shows not only how the lower sexual instincts (including audience voyeurism) can lead us astray when making conclusions about other people but also how the better sexual instincts (those to do with love and caring for someone) are a serious guide that take us in the right direction when logic fails us.A book that Ryan's character is teaching (and a recurrent symbol in the film) is Virginia Woolf's 'The Lighthouse'. The book is famous for 'stream of consciousness' writing - a technique that records the multifarious thoughts and feelings of a character without regard to logical argument. It shows us ways people are percieved differently, often inaccurately, and also highlights the conflict between archetypical feminine and masculine approaches. This is a further clue to the movie and is borne out in the finale.In the Cut presents a gritty, realistic and (because of its accuracy) almost affectionate side of New York that is omitted or unrealistically glossed over by most American cinema. It is also an eye-opener on Meg Ryan, who will now hopefully expand her career in serious acting as did Niocole Kidman, freed from the restraints of icing-sugar typecasting.A remarkable film that falls just short of a masterpiece. See it, but avoid the uncut version at all costs. American (U.S.) dollars helped the film get made but such censorship can prevents serious art from being enjoyed.",In the Cut

She has a minimalist look here, straight brown hair, little makeup. Had this been her look from way back, she would never have achieved the stardom she has. Don't get me wrong, she's still quite attractive, this is the movies, after all, and this is Meg Ryan. I never understood her character's (Frannie) attraction for Mark Ruffalo's Malloy. He doesn't seem very attractive, and he is basically a lout. It wasn't at all clear to me when she began to suspect him, or why. At least why then more than before. Jennifer Jason Leigh was also good as Pauline, Frannie's emotionally fragile half-sister. Also it was a bit jarring to be confronted with the semi-explicit blow job scene early in the film. I'm not a prude, and don't have a problem with that sort of thing in it's place, but I think you shouldn't be shown such material unless you go just a bit out your way to do so.

34,drownnnsoda,"Bleak and atmospheric, though plodding at times",7,26 November 2007,"""In The Cut"" follows Frannie (Meg Ryan), a college professor in New York city who finds herself in a frightening mystery when a serial killer begins murdering women in her neighborhood. But things become even more complicated when Frannie begins a relationship with Detective Malloy (Mark Ruffalo), a cop who is investigating the case. As more murders occur, Frannie becomes more worried, and she finds herself closer to the killer than she could have ever imagined.From my brief plot description, this film probably sounds extremely predictable, but it's likely not in the ways you are imagining. ""In The Cut"" is an interesting horror/crime thriller that is unlike most that I've seen. The biggest things that stand out for me in this film are its overall mood and atmosphere - it's a dark, eerie film, and it evokes a bleak uncomfortableness throughout. Another thing is the deepness of the characters themselves. Our two main protagonists, Frannie and Malloy, are both well-drawn and well scripted characters, both brought together by their obsessions and sexual desires, and their loss of connections with the outer world. Sex and lust are sufficient themes in the film, contrasting with graphic violence, which is effective and gratuitous.There are a handful of frightening scenes and everything is very well-shot. The darkness and shadows work well, and the colors are very vivid and fitting. The overall cinematography is quite artistic, and it's a very well-shot movie, albeit a little depressing. However, the film's largest weakness is it's plodding. There is a lot of time spent in the film in which little happens and the story seems to trudge along on it's heels. The script needs a little work in these areas. As for the acting, Meg Ryan was great in an unusual role here, as the lusting, intuitive college professor caught in a murder mystery. Mark Ruffalo is also great as the somewhat scummy, secretive police officer. Jennifer Jason Leigh is also worth noting as Frannie's concerned sister. The ending, while it may have been predictable for some, was a bit of a surprise to me. Then again, I haven't read the novel, so I can't really compare, but I didn't see it coming.Overall, ""In The Cut"" is a bit of a mixed bag, but all things considered, I like the film. It's a moody, bleak, and dark piece of work, and the atmosphere is strong and it sustains some tension. Meg Ryan's performance was good, and the film kept me interested for the majority, but did become tiresome on occasion. If you look at this movie from a standpoint of mood and atmosphere, it really succeeds. Script-wise, it needs some work a little, but director Jane Campion is a talented filmmaker, and her visuals and cinematography make up for it. 7/10.",In the Cut
35,rosscinema,Film fails on every level,4,9 November 2003,"I wish I knew what Jane Campion was thinking when she started filming this and what about this story appealed to her? The overall story comes across as just another bad murder mystery and its been a long time since Campion made anything interesting. This story is about a high school teacher named Frannie Avery (Meg Ryan) and she lives in a seedy neighborhood in New York City and one day while tutoring a student in a bar she notices two people engaged in a sex act in the corners by the bathroom. Then the murder of a woman takes place and the police find the body outside of Frannie's window. Frannie is questioned by Detective James Malloy (Mark Ruffalo) and his partner Detective Rodriguez (Nick Damici) about whether she heard any noise that night. Frannie goes to visit her half sister Pauline (Jennifer Jason Leigh) who is a stripper and they talk about not getting enough sex and men in general. Malloy asks Frannie out on a date and they meet for a drink but she leaves early and while on the way home she is mugged. Malloy finds her and takes her home where they start to talk and then end up in bed. Frannie notices a tattoo on Malloy and its the same tattoo that the guy in the bar had on his wrist. Then Malloy tells her that the woman she saw in the bar was the one that was murdered. Now Frannie starts to think that maybe Malloy is the murderer but she can't help but still be attracted to him. Meanwhile, an old boyfriend of Frannie named John Graham (Kevin Bacon) is acting very weird and hostile and is following her everywhere she goes.
*****SPOILER ALERT*****This film wants to make sure that every character is a suspect and why wouldn't we? We find out nothing about any of them. The lack of characterization is the biggest flaw of this film. Who is Frannie and why is she attracted to the things that she is? This film never tells us and we're clueless to her actions. She's obviously very intelligent but she lives in a dump and is turned on by very sordid behavior. I never had a problem with the casting of Ryan, I think she can play any role and she looks ready to tackle a complex character like Frannie but it seems to be wasted here. There are some genuine moments where Ryan conveys real hopelessness in her own characters behavior but Campion never lets the viewer have any insight as to the reasons. The strong performance by Ryan is pointless with a script without any depth. Another flaw in this film is the character of Malloy played by Ruffalo. His character comes across as a shockingly unsympathetic lout. After the murder of Pauline he describes to Frannie in gruesome detail how she was butchered. Frannie asks him ""Did you kill her""? Malloy then tells her to get the ""F"" out of here! This woman's sister was just murdered and he verbally abuses her. His character was like this from the very beginning and its a big question as to why Frannie would keep seeing him. Its just not believable. When the murderer is finally revealed it just comes across as a routine thriller and Campion is not a routine director. What was she attracted to with this story? Its probably with the character Frannie but Campion needed to let us know more about her. Ryan is a tremendous actress and I hope a better script comes her way soon and I hope Jane Campion takes a good look at her recent films and gets back to the excellent storytelling that she use to do.",In the Cut

This movie looks to supposedly be about desire, especially sexual, but what we the audience are subjected to is a lot of 4-letter words, dirty-talk, and pornish sex scenes that most of us have not signed up for. To substitute in a story, the director has Ryan running around, bumping into different men all over the place to keep us wondering who the murderer might be.

39,Howlin Wolf,"Looks like a mistake for Meg to have gone 'Adult', again...",4,31 January 2005,"""Hurlyburly"" was terrible, I know that much... (see my review elsewhere) and now that I've finally seen her return to such an arena once more, I can honestly say that I found the results to be both as 'eye-opening' AND as unpleasant, if perhaps to a lesser degree... ! Surprisingly, there is actually little that is 'adult' about ""In the Cut"", save for the much vaunted sex scenes... It certainly wasn't 'sophisticated' or 'challenging' - more your average potboiler afforded notoriety because Meg gets her togs off quite a lot... ! Even those only interested in the 'whodunnit' would find it too weak; I'm by no means schooled in such things, but even I dismissed my assessment in the first 5 minutes because I thought it had to be more intricate than was my instinct. Not so. It seems Hollywood is quite willing to take any old 'slapdash' route, if they know they'll still get their grubby little mitts on your hard-earned dosh... !",In the Cut
40,Maciste_Brother,A definite future camp classic!,3,30 March 2005,"When I rented IN THE CUT, I had no clue of what it was about, who directed and such. And I've rarely seen anything with Meg Ryan. So when I watched this film, I just could not believe how wonky it was. It's so over-the-top in its approach to everything (acting, cinematography, design, dialogue, etc) that this movie will become a definite camp classic in the near future.The combination of sordid storyline, hip ""edgy"" editing and camera composition, and sex guarantees that this movie will standout from the rest of the bland pack of Hollywood junk and be remembered not necessarily because it's good but because it tries so hard to be different than the rest of the crap Hollywood makes. It's deliriously over-the-top, over-directed thing that has to be seen to be believed. It reminded me of a Marilyn Manson music video. But unlike a music video, which usually lasts 4 minutes, this film is 2hrs long. Imagine looking at a 2-hour long music video, with every shot and bits of acting being showy and edgy, and hopelessly pretentious. The ""flashback"" scenes, those with the ice skating, are just too much. Was the director channeling Guy Maddin?If it wasn't for the film's slow pace and some really annoying characters (like the one badly played by Jennifer Jason Leigh), this movie would stand almost shoulder to shoulder as being as entertaining in the ""it's so over-the-top"" category as SHOWGIRLS. If you like campy, over-the-top films, make sure to check out KILLING ME SOFTLY as well. Though not as deliriously wonky as IN THE CUT, both ""thrillers"" are destined to become cult camp classics and they would make a great double feature.",In the Cut
41,seymourblack-1,Debunking The Notion Of Romantic Love,8,3 November 2014,"During a police investigation into a series of grisly murders in New York City, the lead homicide detective and a woman who may have some useful information to share, get involved in a steamy sex-driven affair. From that point on, the progress of the murder investigation and the woman's emotional journey are inextricably intertwined in a story that highlights a lack of romanticism in sexual relationships and the difficulties she encounters in a world where all the men that feature in her life are naturally violent, neurotic or, at best, insensitive.Frannie Avery (Meg Ryan) is an English teacher who's fascinated by slang and habitually records the brief passages of poetry that she sees on her regular subway journeys. This rather withdrawn academic is shocked but riveted one afternoon when she goes in search of the bathroom in a local bar only to see a couple in a shadowy corner engaged in oral sex. Some days later, she's visited by Detective Giovanni Malloy (Mark Ruffalo) who's investigating the murder of the woman who Frannie had seen in the bar. It transpires that her body had been dismembered and some of her remains had been found in the garden somewhere beneath Frannie's apartment.Frannie isn't able to provide any useful information to Malloy and disturbingly, notices a small tattoo on his wrist which leads her to suspect that he may be the murderer. Despite this, she responds positively to his blunt sexual aggressiveness and soon they become lovers. During their affair, Frannie is both aroused and frightened by Malloy's crudeness and when she discusses the relationship with her half-sister Pauline (Jennifer Jason Leigh), she encourages her to stick with it.Despite her sister's reassurances, Frannie's growing fear continues to intensify and gets worse when she unexpectedly finds her highly-strung ex-boyfriend John Graham (Kevin Bacon) sleeping in her apartment. Things then get even worse and her life continues to go into further chaos after she discovers Pauline's mutilated dead body.During her affair with Malloy, Frannie's initially repressed feelings were liberated to the point where, within the relationship, she also became sexually aggressive. However, her pursuit of what she wanted came at a high price, as in order to continue her affair, she allowed herself to be treated in a way that threatened her self-respect and potentially exposed her to even greater dangers. The gritty reality of her experience is in stark contrast to the romanticism of the story she was told about how her mother and father met and fell in love and also the reassuring strains of ""Que Sera Sera"" that are heard periodically.Meg Ryan's portrayal of her sensitive character's lonely, introspective and distrustful nature is flawless and her slightly puzzled expressions reveal a great deal about her responses to what goes on in the harsh city surroundings that she inhabits. Mark Ruffalo is also marvellous and totally convincing in his role.""In The Cut"" has a surprisingly haunting quality that's strongly enhanced by its beautiful atmospheric colour palette of dark greens, browns and reds and scenes which exploit the use of shadows and rain to great effect. Similarly, certain passages which juxtapose romantic images with violent ones leave a lasting impression (e.g. blood tracks appearing in the ice, Frannie's mother's legs being severed and also the timing of when the chirpy ""I Think I Love"" is played).Bearing in mind the types of movies that had brought Meg Ryan her greatest previous successes, it's quite ironic that, possibly her best ever on-screen acting performance, should feature in a movie that debunks the whole notion of romantic love so powerfully.",In the Cut

It amazes me that normally today's cocaine soaked darlings in Hollywood are so clueless about how to engage in sex. For example, slamming a woman against the wall and getting it done in 12 seconds (common in movies) might be all right for the Blackberry set -- whose attention span ends in 12 seconds or less -- but for other folks we like to prolong the pleasure and the romance. By my standard, the thoroughness and enthusiasm displayed by Mark Rullolo in making love to Meg Ryan in this film could serve as a lesson to just about any of the jerks in today's empty-headed Hollywood.",In the Cut

Although we have learned to tolerate one mandatory humping scene in most modern movies, this film has them one lingering copulation after another, each reaching new depths of tastelessness.

48,gregsrants,One hit wonder Campion brings another disaster to the screen,2,15 February 2004,"Back in 1993, Jane Campion was on top of the world.  She had directed the wonderful film, The Piano starring Holly Hunter which was lavished with 8 Academy Award nominations, including one for Best Director.  The Piano, went to the podium four times that year, including and award for Campion herself in the Best Screenplay category.      Jane was only the second female ever to be nominated as Best Director in the history of over 60 years of the golden statue, and the possibilities and expectations of the filmmaker seemed endless.Since then, Campion, has developed what I call, Tarantinoism.  That being, someone who has crafted a great movie, and then goes into recluse taking years before picking the next entry into their filmography.   After The Piano over 11 years ago, Jane has worked on only three films including the forgettable Portrait of a Lady and Holy Smoke.   Her latest attempt at a comeback is 2003's In The Cut starring Meg Ryan and Mark Ruffalo. 
In The Cut is a run of the mill and below average crime-murder-mystery. Meg plays Frannie, a school teacher who becomes the object of affection for police detective Malloy (Ruffalo) after body parts of a killer's victim were found in a garden outside of her apartment.  The two begin an abusive love affair in the vein of Last Tango in Paris where there is no emotional attachment and sexual kinkiness are bland approaches to keeping the audience interested in the characters.  As more bodies begin to pile up on the detectives docket, Campion introduces us to four possibilities as to the identify of the killer.  There is the detective himself, who may or may not have been in the same location as victim number one on the day of her death, the partner cop, who has been stripped of his gun due to conduct unbecoming, the ex-boyfriend (Kevin Bacon) with anger and attachment issues and finally a black student who just always seems to be in the background.  Like any murder mystery movie made in the past twenty years, the least likely candidate is usually revealed to be the mastermind,  and In The Cut is no different.Campion doesn't seem to like men very much. In The Piano, George Baines was a sexual deviant not easily relatable to the audience and Harvey Keitel's PJ Waters in Holy Smoke were equally repellent.  Therefore it was no surprise that the detective played by Ruffalo was an obnoxious homophobe who stereotyped police seen only as villains in glorified Hollywood adventures. The detective talks about his first sexual experience and how he mastered the art of brining sexual gratification to many a woman.The heart of the problem for In The Cut is that none of the characters are very likable.  Frannie is hardly believable as a mentor to others in a teaching capacity and her road to self destructiveness is pretty much met with a who cares' attitude.  Ruffalo plays a detective so unbelievable and self absorbed that he makes Mark Ferman look like a saint.In The Cut has gotten much publicity as Meg Ryan's new image film.  In an explicit sexual encounter, Ryan bares all for the cameras for the first time since a brief nude stint in Oliver Stone's The Doors, in an attempt to distance herself from the cutesy films she has been associated like When Harry Met Sally and You've Got Mail.  However, all In The Cut shows us, is how Meg is nothing more than a bit character that when surrounded by superior talent (Billy Crystal, Tom Hanks), can hold her own by flashing her smiling grin and showing dimples of the big screen.As for Jane Campion, let's just hope she doesn't wait another three years to bring us such ordinary trash as In The Cut.  Another long layoff and failure, could make her the Mr. Mister of the film industry.",In the Cut
49,Danusha_Goska,Ruffalo Alone Is Worth Suffering This Movie For,6,9 July 2005,"There ought to be a special Academy Award for movies that feature full frontal nudity, graphic sex, dismembered bodies being pulled out of washing machines, strippers pole dancing, a scene where a man chops up a woman with an ice skate, and yet still manage to be completely boring.There also ought to be a special Academy Award for movies whose cast and crew include very talented people who, between them, have amassed a string of hits, and yet are still second rate, at best.Here's another potential category - - movies that are produced, directed by, and star members of undeserved groups, African Americans or women, maybe, and yet still manage to present dismal depictions of African Americans or women.Had there been such an Academy Awards, ""In the Cut"" may have taken all three awards in 2003.""In the Cut"" wants to be a newer, bolder ""Klute,"" instead, it's an exercise in head scratching.Why did Jane Campion, maker of woman-friendly ""The Piano,"" make a movie where the two female leads are, alternately, droopy, sleepy, drunken, stupid, self-sabotaging, and/or naked? Where the serial killer is more appealing than they are? The male characters here are lively, fascinating, and/or sexy, by turns. The women? They are so under realized, so . . . fungal - - as in fungal life forms, creatures that reveal little personality or motivation or locomotion or thought - - that, while you aren't actually rooting for the serial killer, you do wish you could jump up on screen, smack these women hard across the face, get them into a cold shower, and inject them with some B 12.And, aren't there already enough B-grade slasher movies out there where women in skimpy dresses and high heels make moves so stupid that the audience screams at the screen? Do we really need an artsy version? This movie doesn't just punish its fictional characters; it also punishes the very fine actress, Meg Ryan. There are scenes whose whole point seems to be, ""Look! Meg Ryan has bags under her eyes!"" and other scenes that revolve around, ""Look! You get to see Meg Ryan's private parts!"" There are similar scenes with Jennifer Jason Leigh, but she's made a career out of this kind of thing, and I wouldn't want to object to her bread and butter.If a male director had made this movie, women - - I - - would be braying.There is something very much worth seeing here, though. It's Mark Ruffalo as a police officer cum sex fantasy cum suspected serial killer.Ruffalo is so excellent here, sexy, earthy, smoldering, vulnerable, alternately, as the plot needs him to be, eminently believable as a dedicated New York City cop who learned how to make love to women early in life and has been collecting lessons ever since, or as a suspected Serial Killer who likes chopping up female bodies - - he's so one hundred per cent fine and memorable at all this that you really want to invent some new video technology that can extract him from the drek surrounding him and insert him into a much better movie.Let's hope he finds his way to a much better movie, very soon, in which he gets to do everything he does here, and more - - serve a worthy plot.Kevin Bacon, as an unhinged medical student and owner of a hairless dog, steals his few brief scenes from a nearly catatonic Meg Ryan. He's scary, loud, and fun. Sort of like a car wreck, you can't look away.Finally, it must be said that ""In the Cut"" contains some strikingly beautiful scenes. The cinematography and composition of some shots bring Gaugin to mind, even though they depict the grimier reaches of lower Manhattan.",In the Cut
50,ajs-10,Ultimately unsatisfying (I'm afraid)...,5,12 December 2010,"A film notorious for some of its racier scenes came up on one of the movie channels and so I decided to see what all the fuss was about. To be honest, not all that much, it's kind of interesting, but ultimately unsatisfying. But more of my thoughts later, here's a brief summary first (summary haters please wait by the lighthouse while I write the next paragraph).Frannie Avery is a writer and a teacher; she lives alone and currently doesn't have a boyfriend. When some remains of a murder victim are found outside her building she is questioned by Detective Giovanni A. Malloy and his partner. It transpires that Frannie had been at a bar frequented by the victim on the day of the murder and may have seen something vital to the case. She is surprised when Malloy asks her out for a drink. At first she is undecided, but is persuaded by her sister, Pauline, to go. They end up sleeping together and this proves to be an enlightening experience for Frannie. I won't say too much more, but then again not much more happens. Needless to say, the case is eventually solved, but not before dire consequences involving one of the cast.This film is most definitely for adults only, there is a strong sexual content and, at times, quite a lot of gore. Now, from that I guess you're thinking, maybe I'll give it a try, but be warned; it has long periods where nothing really seems to happen that moves the story on. Decent performances from Meg Ryan as Frannie, Mark Ruffalo as Detective Malloy and Jennifer Jason Leigh as Pauline. Also nice to see Kevin Bacon in a cameo as Frannie's former boyfriend John Graham (uncredited).It seems the director is more interested in conveying feelings than moving the story along. This, unfortunately, means that there is a lot of discussion that adds nothing to the plot and ultimately makes this film a bit tedious to watch. I like the idea but the execution didn't match up to my expectations I'm afraid. On the plus side, there is some nice close-up cinematography, where part of a face is in focus but the rest is left out to emphasise an expression or a mood. Even so, over all, not recommended I'm afraid.My score: 5.3/10",In the Cut
51,jpschapira,This is cut out for it...,7,22 July 2008,"There are movies that are very good and difficult to watch but easy to write about, like Tom Tykwer's ""Perfume""; movies that are fantastic, also difficult to watch and also easy to write about, like Jane Campion's ""The Piano"". Jane Campion came into my life again, with a good movie I can't quite classify and I'm having a bad time writing about: ""In the Cut""Of course it's also a difficult movie to watch and in comparison to ""The Piano"", it also has many layers. ""In the Cut"" is a film I would like to buy and watch many times, to take each viewing to analyze a different aspect. I have to warn you about something. This is a film in which a crime is being solved, but it's not a film about a crime being solved. It's very important to establish what the story of a film it's truly about, and when you watch ""In the Cut"" you could get confused. And what is it about? Let's start from the start.Frannie (Meg Ryan) is an English teacher, apparently very reserved, who loves to write about things including slang vocabulary and erotic references. She reads a lot of poetry and writes down everything she finds interesting in a notebook or in little notes she has posted in her apartment walls. If you didn't know her, all those writings could make you think she's a murderer in any kind of crime. Most of the poetry she writes down, she reads in the subway advertisements. We never know how much of it is real, because sometimes Frannie reads the same expressions in three t-shirts from different people and because Campion's delicate camera work here is a lot of times out of focus and gives the impression of a 'dreamy' environment. As I said, there's a crime being solved and Frannie has the bad luck of being in the place where the victim was before the murder was committed. I don't want to sound arbitrary or disrespectful towards Susanna Moore, who wrote the novel in which the film is based on and co-wrote the screenplay with Campion, but it's almost as if this crime was a mere excuse for the two main characters to meet. So, suddenly, one day, Detective Malloy (the great Mark Ruffalo), appears at Frannie's door. I'm sure the crime is an important part of Moor's novel, but I'm also certain it's not the main part and Campion was wise enough to make that clear on the screen. If I told you that ""In the Cut"" is a film about love you could think I'm delusional. But I have to tell you this because I don't want you to be disappointed by this piece, waiting for a resolution that is not what you should care about and that Campion gives anyway because she's a nice person, a great director and because she's faithful to the novel she based her movie on. Well, the film is not exactly, or only, about love. It's about loneliness, about character and cinematographic exploration (to think of Campion's shots of the wide beach in ""The Piano"" and to see how she manages the close-ups and how she handles shooting in closed spaces with a perfect visual style, is beyond explanation), about erotic, depraved passions and sex, about lying and telling the truth, about being unpredictable and taking risks. I probably fall short, but ""In the Cut"" deals with all this subjects in extreme detail, and they all revolve around the two main characters. The scene in which they meet is not the typical 'meet cute' you'd experience in a movie about love; it's distant but tense, unpleasant but exciting. Their following encounters are unpredictable, all kept between the limits of reality, and soon Frannie realizes that this Detective is everything she dreams and think about and it's standing in front of her. At first, she can't believe it and can't handle it, because the things she dreams about are not the typical thinks a woman looks for in a man. And this is where the thing gets murky; in the development of the fantasies of Frannie, who's living a real life experience that could well be the plot of a book she could write (with the presence of a disturbing student played by () and an even more disturbing man played by Kevin Bacon), and of which she doesn't know the limits. A word of advice, besides everything I've already told you: pay close attention to the script. It's in the conversations the characters share and in how and where these conversations take place, that the heart of ""In the Cut""; its essence and the things you should care about. This is one of Mark Ruffalo's best performances and probably Meg Ryan's best portrayal, but it's understandable if you don't notice because they completely inhabit their characters, they are deeply compenetraded, and we can never tell the difference between Frannie and Detective Malloy and the actors.",In the Cut
52,gelman@attglobal.net,R Rating?,7,27 September 2004,"With its highly explicit language and sex scenes that leave little to the imagination, In the Cut probably ought to be rated NC-17 instead of R. It's really quite erotic. In the viewing, it works ratherwell as a mystery and suspense movie. However, like many other such films, on examination, it fails to hold together. I liked it, however. Meg Ryan is effective in her role as a sex-starved school teacher, and Mark Ruffalo succeeds as the detective who more than satisfies her sexual needs. The question in the mind of the viewer is who will prove to be the serial killer, and there are enough candidates around to populate several dark alleys if not a loony bin. There's an excess of ""dirty"" talk in this movie.If it were spread thin enough, it could bring financial ruin to a score of over-the-air radio stations. Not that I object, but how this got by the MPAA censors with an R rating is a greater mystery than the one in the movie.",In the Cut

She gets attacked. Her sister gets killed. Lots of red herrings. She eventually kills the killer. Daydream back to her life.What we have is a bunch of disgusting characters. We have porno. We have profanity. We have characters acting out a script that is unrealistic. We have garbage hand held cinematography. We have a couple of classic tunes redone in the worst possible way. We have a story that just does not add up. What the hell was this? A serial killer story? A sexually repressed woman? Here's some of the garbage I noticed. I'm sure there more:Kevin Bacon is a red herring, in a red hat. Nice try.
Meg Ryan, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Mark Ruffalo are all decent actors. But the material/dialogue and script is garbage.
If you watch this as a comedy, maybe intoxicated, you may find some entertainment here. Otherwise forget it.
Meg walks around this movie in a daze. Especially at the end, after she kills Mark's partner. Barefoot, and bloody all over. Nobody stops her. She just walks back to her apartment, and lays beside Mark. Garbage.
At first it seemed like Jennifer's character was Meg's lesbian lover, then we find out she is her sister. What's up with that full mouth kiss in front of the black guy?
The cops, Mark and his partner, unnecessary cursing. Mark's partner has a plastic gun. He would not be on the street. 
Sex scenes are cliché and stupid. City scenes are all hand held garbage cinematography. Tattoo on hand. The guy is getting a blowjob, in the dark, and Meg notices the tattoo from 20 feet away. Right!
Meg mentioned the tattoo to Mark. But Mark didn't add it up that it could have been his partner. What's up with that? Not a very good detective. What's with all the art crap sex talk? Wow, they know the F word. Great. Black student. Another red herring. That goes nowehere. Gay Black bouncer. More filler crap.After the first time Meg did Mark she meets Jennifer in a coffee shop with a black eye. Meg didn't have a black eye when she was with Mark. So, you freaking screw that up too. This is like some kind of an art film. Porno. Profanity. All unlikable characters. No chemistry between the characters or the actors. The Flashback scenes of Meg's parents skiing. Another art failure.Started crap. Nothing happens. Meg dozing throughout taking notes of words that she sees like it's a prophetic insight. Middle crap. Things happen, except they're just garbage. Ending crap. At least the film is consistent. There was a scene where Kevin Beacon asks Meg to watch his dog because he works 18 hours as an intern. Meg refuses. Kevin says well I'll have to put him down then. What the freaking hell was that all about. Who the hell wants to see a movie about some dirtbag characters like this? Who?The ending was just plain garbage. First Meg runs away from Mark after handcuffing him to some pipes in her house. And Mark's partner drives her to a Lighthouse near the George Washington Bridge, where he's got some kind of room with music and wine hooked up. He proposes to her with a knife on a ring. Kisses her. She shoots him with Mark's gun, twice. Ohh, well that shooting practice we had to sit through all adds up now. Then she walks home bare foot, and all bloody. Nobody stops her. She just walks home, finds Mark still hand cuffed to the pipe, and lays beside him. Wow!Last week I watched a low budget film from Poland about some kids going camping and all getting killed. Pretty mindless garbage film. Close to Zero brain power exerted there. Now, I would rather watch that movie than ""In The Cut"". In the Cut looks like they used some brain power, but just wrong.

Ryan almost seems to be trying to PLAY Nicole Kidman but all she does is walk through the part like she is on tranquilizers. No emotion, no life, no spark - just because her and Ruffalo have total nudity scenes and sex scenes - they have no chemistry. Kevin Bacon pops up as a jealous boyfriend, the murders are handled as if they are parking tickets - no suspense, no drama, just matter of fact - there is no real suspense on who did it.

She is questioned by a police detective (Mark Ruffalo) after the woman turns up dead in the alley behind her building. Ryan is strangely attracted to this cop... even after she realizes that the tattoo on his forearm is exactly the same as the one on the arm of the man she saw having sex with the dead girl. It's all supposed to be ""edgy"" and ""raw"" and ""erotic"" but it all just starts to seem silly after awhile. The plot is a terribly contrived compilation of practically every thriller cliché since the genre was invented. But, because it was written by a ""literary"" author (Susanna Moody wrote the novel on which the film is based) it is all supposed to be ""deep"" and ""meaningful"", I guess. Meg Ryan does a good job with a role about as far removed from her usual perky persona as it was possible to go. Mark Ruffalo seems to have patterned his role after Vincent D'Onofrio from Law and Order: Criminal Intent but doesn't have the same intensity... he's just obnoxious and it's anybody's guess why Ryan's character becomes infatuated with him. Jennifer Jason Leigh is totally wasted in the role of the best friend whose ultimate fate is ridiculously obvious from the get-go.",In the Cut
59,postmanwhoalwaysringstwice,Hollywood thriller fans beware!,7,2 October 2007,"Australian director Jane Campion has made such films as the critically praised ""The Piano"", the little seen ""Holy Smoke!"", and the film presently at hand. Each of her films from her earliest shorts to her post-""Piano"" more mainstream fare are distinctive from an artistic standpoint, offer a woman's perspective throughout, and frequently belittle the conventions of genre. For this reason, she's particularly frustrating to male critics and audiences, possibly most evident with her 2003 release ""In the Cut"".The film stars Hollywood sweetheart Meg Ryan, whose resume is filled with equal parts cheese and sugar, although she has attempted dramatic diversions such as ""Flesh and Bone"" and ""Hurly Burly"" along the way. With this film Ryan has managed to completely exit her prior typecasting with a role far grittier and dirtier than any she's had before as an inner city teacher with a questionable relationship with one of her students and a very steamy affair with a police detective. Her ""9 1/2 Weeks""-like exploration of her sexuality is only a portion of the manner in which she paints over the audience's recognition of the Sally Albrights of her past.To a degree the loosening of sexual expectations of the so-dubbed good girl persona becomes one of several story lines that run through the center of ""In the Cut"", which at its core is a thriller. However, this is not in the usual sense of the word. More omnipresent in the minds of viewers would be the serial killer plot that fills several scenes with gruesome detail, but is hardly the point of the film. It becomes upstaged by the mature adult relationship (and romantic thriller, if you will) developed between Ryan's character and the gruff, forceful, porn star looking detective played by the always dependable Mark Ruffalo.Jane Campion's ""In the Cut"" is an underrated, somewhat experimental take on a standard Hollywood genre flick that might exhibit weakness for following such conventions on its surface, but a deeper look shows a far more interesting film.",In the Cut
60,bix171,An Interesting Disappointment,5,19 June 2004,"While not impossible, it's unlikely that a world-class director such as Jane Campion could make something unwatchable and while 'In The Cut' is a disappointment, no two ways about it, it's still an interesting disappointment. Perhaps it's the flaws that make it so. Campion's approach, intentional sloppiness, with Dion Beebe's hand-held camera-work all over the place (much like an episode of 'N.Y.P.D. Blue') mingled with a saturated color scheme, is quite agreeable, but she never really finds her focus and though it's kind of fun to see her dip her toes into lurid melodrama, the film's intentions are never declared. Campion works hard to downplay her artier tendencies in this sweltering tale of sexual transgression mixed with serial murder but, try as she might, her studied visual sense mingles a bit too easily with her apparently instinctual feel for New York City; she effortlessly captures the sensuously steamy claustrophobia and indiscriminate grime that defines both the lure and repulsion of the city. Meg Ryan stars as a professor who gets involved with a detective (Mark Ruffalo) who may or may not be a killer of young women; like Diane Lane in 'Unfaithful', Ryan works overtime to shed her good-girl film persona (while enhancing her own scandalous off-screen behavior), but unlike Lane, she seems fearlessly entranced by the possibilities (no doubt brought on by working with a director of Campion's stature) and she's convincingly sexy. With Jennifer Jason-Leigh (wasted) as Ryan's half-sister and an uncredited Kevin Bacon. It's a shame this film can't be recommended because it has a lot going for it. But it just doesn't feel right.",In the Cut

None of the characters in this movie were endearing in any way.  Now, I like characters who are complex and flawed, but there has to be an appeal in there somewhere.  The Franny character (Meg Ryan) was never developed.  She character was enigmatic, which is a good start, but the plot never developed anything within that character.  I still don't know why she found the detective (Ruffalo) interesting.  I thought the character was rude and unappealing.  
The relationship between Franny and her half-sister, played by Jennifer Jason Leigh, is never fully developed either.The plot, though based on an interesting premise, plodded along much too slowly.  Since the character development was lacking, this made for a very boring movie.

65,SamJamie,Lathargic.,2,18 August 2020,"In the Cut is a 2003 psychological thriller film written and directed by Jane Campion and starring Meg Ryan, Mark Ruffalo, and Jennifer Jason Leigh. Campion's screenplay is an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Susanna Moore. The film focuses on an English teacher who becomes personally entangled with a detective investigating a series of gruesome murders in her Manhattan neighbourhood.In the Cut may be one of the most shallow and uninvolving films I've ever seen, beneath its dense texture and rich mood, Jane Campion's romantic thriller is about nothing and goes nowhere. There is a flat, colour-by-numbers quality to the inherent whodunit and the urban backdrop feels gratuitous and empty, Its a movie that moves between pretentious and incompetent, a sleazy straight-to-video-style sex and violence crapfest which ends up simply laughable when it tries to go arty. I'll give the film slight credit, there is a fabulous performance by Ruffalo in a thoroughly disastrous film...the cheesiest of serial killer beach reads given the gloss of art house pretension",In the Cut
66,revival05,Great telling of an uneven story,6,11 March 2010,"Ambiguity is among cinema's most underrated qualities. Or, rather, its among American cinema's most underrated qualities. When it comes to movies outside of the US, ambiguity is more or less tradition. Hollywood movies on the other hand can like no other movies tell, really the most complicated and abstract of things in a way that anyone can and will understand it. Sadly, I think this form of storytelling is so deeply rooted in the mentality of moviegoers around the world, that a movie with ambiguity in the center of it becomes a challenge. At least if it has Meg Ryan in the lead. Needless to say, In the Cut is in any case a movie that will be shunned by many viewers almost instantly. The average moviegoer might accept the idea of having Meg Ryan in a thriller. But when we start out with some X-rated fellatio, we might just have given a lot of members in the Meg Ryan Fanclub some sleeping problems.And when ambiguity takes over the entire film, it really becomes more of a brain exercise than a movie experience. About halfway into In the Cut I started to realise I didn't really know what the movie was about. That is to say, I had a hard time pinpointing the themes and the overall subject matter. In the movie Meg Ryan plays a high school English teacher who is a closet sex monger. This is a cliché of course, but the movie does a good job hiding it. In any case, she is attracted to homicide detective Mark Ruffalo who's investigating some murders by one of those pesky serial killers terrorizing the neighborhood slitting women's throats. Only problem is he might be a really bad guy, since the tattoo she spots on his wrist is identical to the one she saw on another man. She never saw this man's face, but he wasn't up to any good.Alright, so far so good. One might argue that she shouldn't have anything to do with him, but the movie argues that good sex will make you risk a lot of safety net, that perhaps being part of the idea. I get it. Ambiguity. We don't need to understand exactly everything. Meg Ryan does a very good job of portraying this too. We are really never allowed to map her out, neither can we really trust any of the other characters in the movie - there are many, too many, but the main two to mention is her sex-deprived sister (Jennifer Jason Leigh, wouldn't you think) and Ruffalo's ""now I'm scary, now I'm not"" horndog who is constantly switching between the male wuss and the male beast. You basically get acquainted with these characters as a third witness and herein lies the best thing in the movie. Ryan and Ruffalo share a lot of scenes where you can only guess what any of them are thinking. And while the scenes between Ryan and Leigh are more private and intimate, the same goes with those.Now all of this is nice and good. Yet, as I said, I wasn't really following. I find that I like the characters, but everything surrounding them is just confusing. Ah, herein lies the confusion. I pick up all of these naturalistic character traits, and all of their ambiguous choices and I see an interesting piece of gender-oriented, sexual questions being hinted at. But this movie is supposed to be a thriller, right? There's this whole bit about some killer I have to care about, right? And there's also these pointless characters that fill up the screen - most notably an over-acting Kevin Bacon as a psycho stalking ex boyfriend begging for every frame. And I'm sure these flashbacks of the parents of Ryan's character is supposed to mean... well, something right? And while I pick up lots of nice brain fodder, the main question still lingers throughout the movie from frame one - What is this all supposed to be about?Any discussion one might have about any pondering one might get from watching the movie becomes rather futile, because nothing more needs to be said when the final third act comes crashing all over the movie. Oooh aah, murder and plot-thickening. The slashing killer is getting near! And the movie also ties itself into its inevitable knot. As one might imagine, too many threads will eventually tangle up. In the Cut is an all too well fitting title to this movie, because into the cutting room this movie really should have gone. I suspect a lot has to do with the fact that this is based on a novel, and that the author has been working on the screenplay. Bash me all you will, but I think books are treated with way too much respect when they are adapted into films. In the Cut is a prime example. Had it just been the main characters and their maze wandering in an out of each other, this could have been a really great movie. I don't care if the murder puzzle is never solved at all, it would have been a better film. As it is now, Ryan's performance and Jane Campion's pretty flawless execution makes it impossible for me to really give it a proper thumbs down. I do suspect the novel makes more sense, though. The Novel gets to be a better novel than the film gets to be a better film, this time too.",In the Cut

I kept with it, hoping it would improve. I found it draggy, dull, dark and dismal. A sleazy story with totally unnecessary graphic scenes. For example, I think we can all realize that fellatio is in progress when we see a woman's head bobbing up and down between a man's thighs as she kneels in front of him. Was there a need then to show two closeup scenes of the man's organ in her mouth (or was it a prosthesis?). Anyway, unnecessary and disgusting for a mainstream film.I guessed who the killer was very quickly, no real brain power needed there. Meg Ryan played the part as well as could be expected, considering the awful script. She was virtually unrecognizable from her earlier films, must have had extensive facial surgery I imagine.Overall, I found nothing of value in this movie. The nude scenes were gratuitous, apparently put in to show that Meg Ryan was entering a new stage as a leading Hollywood actress. No wonder that the English interviewer Parkinson (whom I dislike intently) took a nasty attitude towards her. I have no idea what Meg Ryan is like as a person, but as an actress, she ought not to have taken this ratty part.I can recommend this flick only to hard-hat serial killer or Meg Ryan fans.",In the Cut
70,ScottDMenzel,A Horrible Movie on Every Level,2,1 November 2003,"In the Cut stars Meg Ryan in her oddest role of her career. This however is also her worse role of her career. In the Cut is about a lonely woman named Franny played by Meg Ryan who gets involved with a police detective (Mark Ruffalo) who is looking for the murderer of a beautiful young girl. This movie is supposed to be a Psychological Thriller however it never goes anywhere. The movie follows Franny as she becomes obsessed with the police detective and finds him sexually seductive. The film reminds me more of a soft-core porn flick than anything else with a masturbating scene or a sex scene almost every 15 minutes which doesn't serve any point to the film. It's like the director said well Meg where going to erase your good girl image and we are just going to put you in this film where all you will do every 15 minutes is masturbate or have sex. The films dialog is absolutely horrible as well. The dialog of this film seems to be written by a bunch of 12 year olds and offers nothing to the film. The acting in this film is terrible. Meg Ryan and Jennifer Jason Leigh are usually good actresses but in this film their performances are beyond poor. Also the performances are not believable. The camera angles and film's direction was also poor. The movie seemed very dark and blurry at times. It seemed very amateurish. The film's plot is also not strong and the whodunit is so obvious that if you only pay attention to the film for the first ten minutes you already have the whole movie figured out. In the Cut runs well over 2hrs which makes it even worse than it already is. I would rather do anything than watch this film again. It is painful and almost impossible to sit through since not a single thing of excitement happens till the very end and when it does happen like I said before you already seen it coming so there is no real payoff for watching this film. In Conclusion, In the Cut isn't worth anyone's time and to me is one of the worst films of the year. This movie seemed promising but didn't live up to my expectations.  My final rating for In the Cut is a 2/10.",In the Cut
71,galensaysyes,Director in the wrong neighborhood,2,11 March 2007,"A director from Down Under makes a reputation with small, trim, sort of distilled and bottled movies, products of a literal island culture. Then he--or here, she--hits the presumed big time of Hollywood, and there is drained, quickly or slowly, of the purity and sharpness of sensibility that had drawn viewers to him in the first place, and never makes an interesting movie again.Peter Weir, Bruce Beresford, Vincent Ward...and now, it begins to appear, Jane Campion. Except that she is not so simple a case. Before this film, her first Hollywood product, she had made a failure in her original mode with Portrait of a Lady, which felt too previous, as though she had suffered a director's block but, rushed along by everyone's expectations after The Piano, had not had the leisure to sort out her material before production. She failed again in Holy Smoke, which provided some of the same kind of pleasures as her first films, and in the same manner, at once ascetic and satirical--sort of Mike Leigh meets Georgia O'Keeffe--except in the central dramatic situation, the relationship between the deprogrammer and the deprogrammee, which felt essentially false, like a one-act play with no life outside the theatre walls. The situation that set it up, however--the sincere, venturing, spiritually needy girl, bumping elbows against things as she went along, and her overbearing, blundering family--felt truly observed; and this, and Kate Winslet's performance, made the film worth seeing. In the Cut is not. But it isn't another Green Card or Silent Fall; Campion has carried her interests and techniques over into her first American film with the intent, I think, of selecting a subject and a method of treating it that would make the film seem like a conventionally marketable sex thriller, suitable for video-store shelves, while being on the inside another study in sexual politics, dynamics, inversions of expected roles, and so forth, an illustration of a thesis. As in Holy Smoke (and, I suspect, if I went back to check, Portrait of a Lady and The Piano), the male-female relationship here doesn't ring true, in general or in detail; it feels as if the scenarists had taken a book of sexual theory and dressed it up as drama. The drama would probably gain in credibility, and better articulate the points it's making, if any of the men in the films were in fact attractive. But they're never allowed to be. In this film, for example--which may reflect Campion's view of American males--the boyfriend is repulsively boorish, the former boyfriend obsessive to the point of unintended parody. Her women seem to be trapped in their own bad taste. Admittedly this may be a widespread condition, but it's a subject more fit for satire--whither perhaps Campion's natural bent leads her, whether she will or no. But this film is not a satire, or not deliberately. It's a sex and murder thriller in which the heroine fails to observe the clues to the prime suspect's identity until almost the end of the movie. At every step some unlikely detail, existing only to prop up the plot, obtrudes itself. Why does she hold teaching sessions in a bar? To give her a reason for being there. Why, in a bar so ordinary, does the stair to the rest room look like a descent into Hell? So she won't see the face of the man there. Why is her student, whom she is unconcerned to be meeting at a bar, a fan of a serial killer? So he will be a suspect. Why is her ex-boyfriend, whom she is unconcerned to be stalked and menaced by, a seeming psychotic? So _he_ will be a suspect. So it goes right through to the end. The denouement depends on a coincidence that seems especially unlikely, as well as unprepared for, and so somewhat a cheat. The plot never involved me in the least. But I couldn't help noticing that it's a plot for a Brian de Palma movie--pre-mainstream de Palma, I mean. The title suits; and some of the shots in the film might be quotations from de Palma's movies. I wonder if this was deliberate, and if Campion was attempting to show how one of those movies would appear from the other side, the woman's side. If so, I would say that she failed. Her film fumbles its thrills, and is not elevated above exploitation by the addition of amateur therapy sessions in which the woman talks through her sexual problems, or of sepia-tinted snowy fantasies. Campion's talents seem wrongly matched to this genre, and to the American setting, or at any rate, _this_ American setting. Her habitual work is too cozy in scale, too subtle in angle, too colonial, or perhaps anthropological, in outlook--so that for example the verbal patter of New Yorkers and of African-Americans (and perhaps even the idioms of the women in their confession-and-response dialogues) is made to sound like ritual language, its colors and rhythms a little over-heightened, so that to a native it sounds like a parody rather than the real thing. I suspect that antipodean directors like Campion flower in their native region because what is there to be seen and heard is clear, direct, and readily translatable into art; the rest of the world, generally speaking, isn't like that. This might be a subject it would be good for Campion to take up in a future film.",In the Cut

As a language teacher obsessed with sexual or violent slang, she is following her interests only academically until she witnesses a blowjob in a murky bar basement(very comic strip), she may have unwittingly seen a murder. And the handsome cop thinks she might not be so innocent. He is downright dodgy himself, they soon engage in some weird sex. Poor poor Meg is all confused.

Just WHAT was the deal with Meg Ryan and her sister?  They looked like a couple of crackheads...cmon, isn't Ryan a English professor/writer?  why does she spend most if not all of her time over by her depressed, sex starved sister who lives on top of a sleazy strip club?  Were they sisters or lesbian lovers???  and just what did the cop do to allow her obviously demented mind to suspect him of murder?  what, lie about not being at a club getting 'oral pleasure'?  uh ok....i'm not exactly sure how you went from that to the guy being a serial killer.  give me something more, that's not enough.  CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT, ANYONE??  ive yet to see anything that would have me suspect the cop of those murders.  this is why everyone watching the movie KNEW it couldn't be him.  and then to top all this off....da guy who's had only about 6 minutes of total screen time before the end ends up being the murderer?  between Ryan's boyfriend cop and his partner, who else could it have been?

It seemed that the only point of this movie was to get Meg Ryan nude on screen and do some racy sex scenes.  In The Cut tries to do too much, its full of pointless flashbacks about Meg Ryan's mother (what exactly happened again that has you and your sister TOTAL nutcases??  no one ever thought to expand on that), lack of a real plot/direction and too many sex scenes that seem to have been in the film just because they were with Meg Ryan (in the nude of course!

75,Ronin47,"Not that good, but not bad either (**1/2)",6,4 November 2003,"I've been wrestling with how I feel about ""In The Cut"" for days now. It's an incredibly difficult film. Grim, detached, and opaque to the point of seriously angering some audience members (a few actually cheered when the final fade-to-black came), but there were also many times when I was completely exhilarated by its boldness and style. Meg Ryan stars as Frannie, a sexually repressed New York schoolteacher who lives in an apartment building were the dismembered body of a woman was found. The main police officer investigating the crime is Detective Malloy (Mark Ruffalo), a confident and dependable man, but there is something subtly menacing about him. After a short time, the two of them enter into a rather kinky sexual relationship. At the same time, dismembered bodies are still being found nearby, and Frannie starts to suspect Malloy based on his and her connections to the victims. Meg Ryan deserves major props for screwing with her squeaky-clean image by taking a role in a movie that is this graphic and aggressively anti-mainstream. She gives a very good performance. Ruffalo is also good and so is Jennifer Jason Leigh (as Frannie's half-sister).
My favorite thing about this movie is the great and inventive camerawork. New York is photographed in a way that makes it look like a dream place, with a layer of sinister darkness underneath everything. It may be pretentious, but it creates a heck of an atmosphere. I also liked the Jack-The-Ripper meets ""Eyes Wide Shut"" story, even if we've seen it all before. So what didn't I like about it? Like I said, it's an extremely difficult movie. It's too long, too slow, and is full of annoying supporting characters that are only there to be red herrings. A couple of the scenes between Ryan and Leigh drag on interminably. It also seems to think it's saying something new and shocking about serial killer movies, when the makers should have just realized they had a good potboiler here and nothing more. They could have still had great performances, gritty atmosphere, and great camerawork, but ditched all the pretentious rambling and had a much better movie. This is only for hardcore art-film fans.

Other than that, the plot is extremely stupid on the subject of tension. There is nothing to lead you or mislead you to the killer. Very bad.",In the Cut
78,rcavellero,A SLIGHTLY PORNOGRAPHIC BUT ULTIMATLY EFFECTIVE THRILLER!,7,10 February 2004,"I have to say that I was pleasently suprised by this film. Having doubted it's potential on it's initial thatrical release. I just finished viewing the unrated director's cut. And I must say although I found the sexual imagery and non chalant nudity shocking the overall film took me by suprise. The film is tautly directed by period piece filmmaker Jane Campion of Piano fame and stars Meg Ryan in the most honest and effective performance of her career and the super sexy Mark Ruffalo maintaining a noteworthy prescence and the appearence of his full frontal manhood which is to say quite impressive. But thats not what the film is about although all those things do power it to maintain a highly defining and poetic atmosphere laced thick with filth and realism.  Meg Ryan stars as a middle aged woman whom accidentally sees a young woman whom will be victimized later in the day giving an unknown figure oral sex. The film has the makings of a brutal serial killer thriller like Seven but it never strays into formidable, predictable or cliched territory. Instead it handles it's subjects respectfully making it all the more investing as the film continues somewhat slowly but suspensefully to it's suprising and fulfilling conclusion. Let it be said that I stray dangerously away from Meg Ryan movies after Proof of life, Hanging up, etc. but she really makes her mark here I truly haven't seen her this good ever the closest coming would be Courage under Fire. Maybe the material she's constantly offered is beneath her beacause she does better with more emotionally rich and depthful charachters. Mark Ruffalo definatly entertains sex symbol status while also supplying his performance with spine of realism and Jane Campion should definatly be celebrated for a film that devours cinematic fakeness and turns it into a heartfelt realism. This film is brave, This film is original and this film features one of the best performances of the year by Meg Ryan. Although slightly pornographic In the cut remains a truly effective thriller and a mood setting masterpiece!",In the Cut

If you're going to bridge the gap between mainstream thriller and arthouse smut, you need to come up with a less flimsy construction than this. I'm all for stripping Meg Ryan of make-up, ringlets and clothes, but she's wasted her valiant attempts to go grungy on this sub-Patricia Cornwell hooey.Characters are introduced and dispensed with to suit each plot contrivance, creating a mess of scenes that almost completely fail to hang together. More annoyingly, all the women are portrayed as victims and there isn't a single sympathetic male character on show. This is an alarmingly facile approach from the female screenwriters - Campion and source novelist Susanna Moore  who should know better than to judge half the people on the planet as misogynistic, sex-obsessed scumbags.That the whole charade  and make no mistake, this is a charade  drags itself to a ridiculous and unconvincing ending suggests that the filmmakers were as bored with making it as the audience is of watching it.

80,Thorsten-Krings,We may never care who did it,4,24 July 2007,"I had high expectations of this film but somehow it didn't deliver. One of the reasons why the film is a very unsatisfactory experience is that the main characters are completely over the top. You keep expecting hidden depths but they are hyperactive and superficial. That's the main reason why I lost interest in the story fairly early on. The whole obsession thing doesn't work for me because you just can't see what should be fascinating about either of them. Then there's the story itself: there is nothing in there you haven't seen a hundred times before. Visually, the film is fairly shocking at times but it has no real impact because the victims except for one remain anonymous and there is no Harry Bosch like reaction from the main character. So why should we care? It's all unreal. All in all the film is just utterly unremarkable in a genre that you can only do these days if you add a real good twist to the plot. Visually -although drastic at times- the film owes more to the aesthetics of TV then cinema. The drastic scenes (sex and violence) seem to be very contrived and don't have anything to offer apart from their shock value.",In the Cut
81,Jexxon,In the Nude - A film that both sucks and blows,1,19 March 2005,"First off, this is definitely not a thriller. There is a serial killer back-story and a few scenes that are literally drenched in blood, but it's all secondary stuff. Rather, it's an erotic (sleazy more like it) drama. Meg Ryan's sex starved teacher/writer somehow manages to get involved in a case of a gruesome killing, and subsequently involved with the detective (Ruffalo, sporting a really sleazy mustache) investigating the murder. What follows is 90 minutes of watching these two characters (and others) having sex, talking about sex, fantasizing about having sex, and walking around in the nude most of the time.Let's face it - if it wasn't for the occasional graphic sex scene and Ryan getting her clothes off, nobody would have even known In the Cut existed. It's a slow moving pretentious drama that tries to say something about sex and love, I guess. It's all very vague, and you can never really identify with or care about any of the characters. There are never any explanations given as to why people (especially the killer) act the way they do. The quasi murder mystery also require some pointless characters, whose only purpose is to be potential killers. It's the kind of film where you could have five different endings, each with a different killer - and they would all make as much (or little) sense.But the main problem is the pretentiousness. Oh, how I hate it. Slow pace, blurry artsy photo, horrible music, and the fact that Ryan's writer, for no apparent reason or advancement of the plot, collects quotations and words she comes across. They also manage to throw in some sub-sub plot about Woolf's To the Lighthouse (another piece of work I didn't like). Of course, it might just be another allusion to sex, considering the phallic construction of a lighthouse - not to mention the illustration of an erect red throbbing... lighthouse on a blackboard early in the film.Anyway, I thought In the Cut was horribly dull and pointless. It looked like crap and the sloppy writing and acting left me cold. It's not a good sign when the thing I'm most likely to remember of this film is just how awful Meg Ryan's inflated lips looked.

82,clydestuff,As muddled as a dirty puddle and left me befuddled,4,4 April 2004,"In The Cut is one of those films where you'll sit and watch with a certain amount of puzzlement.  It's a film that is unsure of whether it wants to be a mystery thriller with sexual overtones, or a provocative story about erotic sexual liaisons with a suspense thriller tossed in as the side salad. It doesn't work on either level.Franny Averey (Meg Ryan) is a New York English teacher who has this strange habit of collecting words.  She collects them off subway signs, from conversations, billboards or wherever they may happen to pop up.  She does this because she says it is her passion.  Now you may be wondering what this word collecting has to do with the story.  The answer is nothing.  It provides us no insight into Franny's character, and is nothing more than one of those odd character traits given to someone for no reason other than the fact that it makes them look quirky.  I only bring it up because it is mentioned often in this film with no point or relevance as to why and it clearly demonstrates why so much of this film ends up being a pointless melange.Fran also has a sister, Pauline (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and their relationship is one of the few good things about the film.  They talk as sisters who are close would, confiding intimately with each other and offering advise when needed.  The problem is that Pauline's character is as murky as Fran's.  She has an obsession with some medical doctor, lives over a strip club, and hangs around with the prostitutes that inhabit the premises.  Pauline and Franny are two wild and crazy gals alright, but don't count on figuring out why.One morning before heading to teach her English class, Franny stops at a local bar to meet and converse with one of her students Cornelius Webb (Sharrieff Pugh).  From what I could figured out, she meets Cornelius because he has a new slang word for Franny to add to her word and phrases collection.  Either that or they've had sex at some time or another.  We are never told for sure.  Perhaps Director Campion felt that if we knew for sure Franny was having sex with a student, it would sully her as a sympathetic character, although everything else she does in this film would be enough to degrade even the worst street corner hooker in any big city.  At one point she travels down to the dark basement to use the Restroom, and in the shadows finds a woman performing oral sex on a man.  Although it is very dark, and she watches from a distance, Franny sees a tattoo on the man's hand, but is unable to see anything of his face.  Call it Creative Lighting 101.It isn't long before Det. Malloy, (Mark Ruffalo)stops by Franny's apartment investigating the fact that some woman had lost her head, literally, in Annie's yard.  There is supposed to be some underlying sexual tension between the two, but I never felt it.  That must have come later that evening when Franny is lying in her bed having sexual fantasies about the good detective.  We are never clued into why she is attracted by him. Malloy is a foul mouthed low class basic Neanderthal, and Franny is supposed to be educated and intelligent.  I suppose some would call what Franny does as slumming.It goes without saying that that eventually Franny and Malloy end up in the hay together in a steamy sex scene where Meg sheds her clothes and her girl next door image all at the same time.  The scene is filmed with frankness and little modesty, but it is also a scene lacking in any kind of passion. It's as if Franny and Malloy are almost performing an act of self masturbatory gratification, and in a way perhaps they are. While watching scenes such as this one, I couldn't help but think of the film Looking For Mr. Goodbar with Diane Keaton. In that film, Keaton hopped from bed to bed of just about any who could please her on any particular night.  It worked well in that film because we understood Keaton's makeup and motivation, and the self-destructive tendencies that came with it.  Ryan's Franny lacks any kind of motivation about anything.  Besides word collecting, we get pointless scenes of Ryan daydreaming about how her parents met.  These daydreams pop up at the oddest moments, and are as useless to us as Ryan's word and phrase collecting habit.After a while, more victims pop up.  Franny begins to suspect Malloy might be the killer but sleeps with him anyway.  Besides the student, Cornelius, Campion throws in a few more suspects such as Kevin Bacon playing Franny's obsessive ex, and even Malloy's partner.  They don't add much to the story, except to keep you in some kind of pseudo suspense. They do have to have more than one murder suspect, don't they?  The biggest problem with the murder story is Franny's own unexplained rashness and lack of intelligence. In other words, you'll earn your Nancy Drew merit badge long before Franny does.If Campion was trying to create a suspenseful murder mystery, she didn't succeed.  If she was trying to create a provocative film with sexual undertones she didn't succeed there either.  If she was trying to create an artsy hodgepodge of meaningless and pointless images, well I guess she may have succeeded in that, and of course if that's the only thing you achieve than I have no choice but to give In The Cut my grade of D.",In the Cut
83,fraser-simons,Much better than expected,8,18 June 2021,"The low rating had me putting this off for ages; unjustly, it turns out! Everything about this was great.The syncopated soundtrack and cinematography work so well in tandem. The atmosphere is the inner life of Meg Ryan's character, who loves expression through words but can't communicate well in person.The lies each character tells themselves are so contrived and emblematic of real world contradictions. People crash together sloppily, frenetically. There is no Hollywood imprint despite the actors being well known (fantastic casting imo). Sex is dialogue in the film and everything else is connective tissue.This is off putting, and it should be. In the peripheral is a killer circling, but doesn't feel ""real"" in the same way people in reality treat death, serial killers, and crime in general-especially in this genre. It's voyeuristic and a defence mechanism that's sprouted up with modernity.The movie has a lot to say on multiple subjects and the crime aspect is basically just icing on the cake for me. It's interesting enough with the sisters past and how it's shaped them. Add the powder keg element and it feels both dreamy and on edge. I think it's more cerebral than people expected, especially from these actors, certainly subversive of the genre too. I am not surprised people didn't like it.But now, years later, without ad copy and marketing and expectations, it's easy to take it for what it is: an engaging, nuanced, intersectional crime drama that, in my opinion, far more than makes the cut.",In the Cut

There are some interesting performances by actors playing totally different parts to what we're used to Mark Ruffalo, Kevin Bacon and most notably Meg Ryan, but although their quite good you don't really care or connect with the characters they play.

It did not flow well.Hopefully the next movie Mark Ruffalo does will be something worthwhile for talent like his.  His performance was good considering what he was given to work with, but the story needed more work to allow him to give the character the depth and development it deserved.  One has to wonder what was cut out of this movie, based upon some of the dialogue that does occur in this film between Ruffalo's and Ryan's characters.It gave Meg Ryan a new direction for the first time in a long time.  She definitely wasn't playing your every woman or girl next door type in this movie.

This film deals more of what happens when a woman is continuously victimized by the idea of true love and the world it places her in. Meg Ryan? I gave her the benefit of the doubt. It paid off. She is marvelous. Her character is enigmatic and sexy. The fact that they washed away her Hollywood image delighted me. Her sexual demands are tastefully perverted. Mark Ruffalo? His primitive macho cop demeanor plays well for Ryan's repressed desire to have sexual fulfillment. Why does sex effect so many of us? Why not just tell us all about it as children. We're not stupid. Just tell us the truth.Ryan's character has lost connection to the world. Her wisdom and insight comes from banner poems on public transport. Ryan displays an inner coolness that I find attractive. She does not respond to silly questions and reacts slightly to incredible events such as being hit by a car. She is in her own world of thought lost in an idealistic vision of happiness and love but lives her reality in perverted surroundings and grime. The people in her life all seem to be disconnected.There is a serial killer on the loose and Ryan's interaction with him is hauntingly chilling while at the same time beautifully shot. There is a mystery as to whom he might be. The riddle was of minor concern. I was more fascinated watching Ryan's character. The film is filled with fabulous shots. Highly stylized. Several closeups of Meg Ryan's world. The film drags a bit and lingers into the unknown at times just as the protagonist Ryan. It has moments of beauty that is rarely seen on the screen in this day and age. I give this film a 10.Victor Nunnally BFA Dramatic History and Theory BFA Film Theory and Production,In the Cut
90,maeander,Pedestrian film for Meg Ryan fans only.,4,9 February 2004,"""In The Cut"" as a film is a profound disappointment. Considering the amount of talent involved, it is unfortunate that the final work is so hollow. The problem lies not with the acting, direction, look, feel or sexuality of the film; but with the oh-so-predictable script.A series of gruesome serial murders have occurred. One of the leads suspects the other lead to be the killer. If this sound familiar think ""Tightrope"", ""The Big Easy"", ""Sea Of Love"", ""Sisters"", ""Whispers In The Dark"", ""Matter Of Trust"", ""Frenzy"", ""Coma"",  ""Blink"", ""Basic Instinct"", ""Body of Evidence"", etc. In most cases the killer is not the other lead. (One of the biggest strengths of ""Basic Instinct"" is that the killer is the other lead.)If the killer is not the other lead, that leaves only two choices. It is someone we have not met ex: ""Tightrope"" or a minor character we have met. When a character we have just met in the last ten minutes of the film turns out to be the killer, it never really works. It always seems tacked on. That leaves the killer to be someone (a close friend, buddy, pal, etc.) of the other lead. In 90% of this type of film that is what happens. And that is what happens with ""In The Cut"". We've been here so many times before. There is nothing new in this film. Even the nudity is nothing more than standard window dressing for this type of film.

Since a killer was needed, the writers went back to Sea of Love and grabbed the sidekick.Hmmmm, there's a lighthouse on the sidekick's desk, so we should know the thrilling conclusion will take place in one. We know this too because Frances is teaching her students about V. Wolff. It's obvious, isn't it? Surely all those messages Frances kept reading on the subway, on city walls and every other place in between were clues.

(e.g. Kate Winslet went on to do a Campion film after Titanic rather than a more obvious blockbuster and here we have that doyen of the banal, Meg Ryan in a powerful role!) In The Cut starts with ""Que Sera, Sera"" - which will probably but thriller fans in mind of Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much - but unlike Hitchcock Jane Campion does not make suspense the key to the film.  Instead she concentrates on the erotic and on the relationship between two sisters. This proves to be both a strength and a weakness of the film. The first half is instantly compelling with the restless camera work and shallow focus, that means the edges of the screen are often not in focus, giving the film a misty detached feel.  Unfortunately, Campion loses interest in the murder story and the film would have benefited greatly from a better balance of suspense and eroticism.  It is this sidelining of suspense that makes this feel more like the cinema of a French director like Carax than a high profile Hollywood film. The film has been unfairly dismissed as pornographic (particularly the blow job - which seems to have ruffled many a feather from some of this boards comments!) but it is this undercurrent of  dark sexuality that gives a key to Ryans character.  She watches the blow job fascinated, appalled and turned on, she hangs out in the rougher side of town and prefers hanginjg out at her sisters apartment above a sex club than at her own.

I found this film to be very different than what I expected, IN A BAD WAY.Frankly Meg Ryan did not give much of an acting performance to speak of, she was basically a big name presence in an otherwise unremarkable thriller.The main selling point I guess was for people who wanted to see Meg Ryan in an erotic thriller. Well I did not find this movie all that erotic, yes it was disturbing and rather seamy. As for the thriller element I already worked out the possible identity of the killer the first time I saw him and had decided for definite by the time he reappeared. The characters were really not that well drawn or all that interesting.Kevin Bacon and Jennifer Jason Leigh were also wasted as their performances were nothing that could not have been achieved by lesser name actors. But of course this was the purpose, to add recognizable names to increase ticket sales and rentals.This movie to me was a total disappointment on all levels. It failed to be much of a memorable erotic thriller, it failed to provide great acting performances and it failed to provide an intricately plotted story containing some unexpected surprises.It was however not complete drivel, and is a serviceable enough thriller, but I would not recommend that much money be spent to watch it. 5/10",In the Cut

I saw it with a male friend and he really didn't understand why the female characters reacted the way they did.Why was Meg Ryan's character so cautious yet clearly drawn to the police detective - after all if a female likes a guy in a film she just likes him right? They sleep together and nothing deeper than that is ever portrayed.Thankfully in this movie that is wrong. This film is one of a very few which actually gets some reality into the constant and conflicting emotions of women who may be drawn to a man, but also fear him.Set up around a murder case, there is an air of threat in every scene of this film. Women as victim is a clear symbol here of the constant images and onscreen portrayals women are forced to sit through time after time, to see their gender murdered, mutilated, raped or menaced often for nothing more than a plot device.The fear and longing that this creates in the average female is beautifully rendered in this film, where women, treated like sex toys, like garbage, like meat, have to somehow navigate their way through suspicion, concern and even violence, hoping only to come out the other end unscathed and perhaps loved.It's a harrowing film to watch. To see the female psyche unadorned up on screen, vunerable and haunting, but ultimately searching for a male they can trust.It is interesting to me that men don't get this, they don't understand the pulpable tension when the detect ive takes the protagonist out into the woods. SHe's jumpy, but it's more than that - he is unaware of how he is scaring her. It's a power play he is so used to playing that he doesn't even notice it.When they sit at the bar he tells her he will be anything she wants him to be, she wants him to be trustworthy but she can't trust him because his lips do not speak the truth, after he tells he won't hurt her, he abandons her to the night and a would be rapist/mugger.As a psychological thriller it is up there with the best.  The acting is excellent, with surprisingly good performances from both Meg Ryan and Jennifer Jason Leigh, both of whom manage to leave their stock Hollywood personas thanks to skillful direction by Campion.ignore the fact that the murder mystery in the film makes little sense, it is there only as a metaphor and a reflection of the role of victim in which women seem to be constantly cast.",In the Cut
102,d_carlotaj,Role Playing and Toxic Masculinity,10,21 November 2020,"""In the Cut, "" (2003). Starring Meg Ryan, Mark Ruffalo, and Jennifer Jason Leigh. Director Jane Campion. Written by Jane Campion and Susanna Moore. This movie seemed so bizarre at first. I had trouble figuring out where I was being led. The male/female relationships were not the usual romantic type. And Meg Ryan always seemed to react to the advances of individual males as if she had just had a bone chilling premonition. And to be truthful, I wondered why the men did not react to the female lead in a normal attraction mode. After the film was over, it occurred to me the title of the movie was a clue. The men in this story represented the type who possessed a big, dark predatory instinct. This type of man sees that in order to get ""in the cu*t,"" he has to role play. He has to pretend to be attracted, make the right moves, and the lady will succumb to his efforts. He has lured her to place where he can get to do what he fantasizes about, a woman victim in ""the cut"" of his knife or razor. The women fantasize about romance leading to marriage. Marriage imagery runs throughout the film. They fantasize about undying love and everlasting, till-death-do-us-part marriage. Never dreaming that the undying love and death do part is coming up quick and so is his undying fantasy. So ""in the cu*t"" and ""in the cut"" are the adminatio enlaced throughout.
It is similar to the Lacy Peterson murder paradigm. Goldie Hawn's movie ""Deceived"" had this theme. In Deceived, her husband confesses that his understanding was that marriage to him was a temporary role playing for sex and why should women feel deceived? Men who kill their wives have this view of marriage.

Yeah, there's a bit of a murder mystery going on in the background, and some characters are added to try and misdirect the viewer, but ultimately it's a weak mystery. The intrigue in this movie is how Meg Ryan gets to live out a dark fantasy with a seedy detective who might or might not be a killer running around on the loose. Meh. The focus on wordplay and slang is interesting, but I wish it played a bigger role in the story, as it seemed to be thrown in there just to make the script seem intelligent. All of the actors did a good job, but they were handed a weak story that was ultimately not that compelling. Not a terrible movie, but I question why this story was worth telling.

107,Unicorn-9,"Decently made, but disappointing",3,22 October 2003,"This is one of those movies where the first 20 minutes are quite engrossing, but by an hour in you're more concerned about the pain in your butt from sitting in a lousy cinema seat than whether Joey the Happy Gerbil will rescue the Rat Princess before she's forced to marry the Evil Overlord, or whatever. Now, admittedly, it's a movie in the 'forty-ish New York women looking to get laid before they get murdered but can't find a good man' genre, which isn't my usual kind of film, but I'm always willing to at least give ethnic cinema a chance.Technically, the biggest problem is that it felt like either a ninety minute story in a two hour movie, or a two hour movie made with chunks from a four or five hour story. Various characters and subplots turned up and vanished seemingly just to make them potential suspects in the murder sub-plot or potential hurdles in the getting laid plot, but looked like they were probably far more important in the novel. Equally, other subplots ran through the movie but never really seemed to go anywhere (e.g. the poems on the subway).That presumably worked, because it did keep me guessing about the identity of the murderer through the film, yet, at the same time, the ending managed to be predictable and unsatisfying: 'forty-ish New York women looking to get laid before they get murdered but can't find a good man' isn't my normal kind of book genre either, so I don't know for sure, but I've read a few comments that the novel ending was very different and more in keeping with the general 'dark' tone of the rest of the movie.The other big problem I had is that this is a movie that probably only got funded because it was made by a female writer and female director. Nothing against female writers or female directors -- I've worked with a few and they've made some of my favorite movies -- but had this been made by a male writer and male director it would probably have been written off as formulaic misogynistic claptrap, whereas because it was made by a female writer and director it will presumably become an ""important"" movie and win plenty of awards.So it's not a really bad movie that makes you want to gouge your eyes out, but it's not a great movie, either. There's nothing particularly original about the plot and I think even the graphic oral sex in a semi-mainstream movie has been done before, it suffers somewhat from the obligatory GrittyCam(tm) required by all urban movies these days -- i.e. wobbly and out of focus shots -- and, frankly, too many sex scenes that get in the way of what plot there is. If it was, say, a forty-ish Chloe Sevigny trying to get laid (i.e. cute, but not stunning), maybe it would have been more convincing and interesting, but I just can't see Meg Ryan having too much trouble finding a decent man if she wanted one... despite her acting, having aged pretty well really works against her here.In the end, it's not a movie I came out of wishing I could get my money back, but equally I'm sure I could have found much better uses for my time.

Seldom have I seen a film that so truly examines the dark side of our sexual impulses. I walked out quite shattered, and wandered around in a daze for a while.Meg Ryan completely miscast? Ridiculous and insulting. How dare you tell an actress she has to be Little Mary Sunshine for the rest of her life. And she pulls it off brilliantly.

Must have a very limited range of acquaintances, or alternatively, don't like the real people you do know.Thriller plot not thrilling? Admittedly it's not the strongest point in the film, but it has all the required shocks and surprises (and, you'd think enough gore for the modern audience), and while the revelation of the murderer is not the biggest twist ending ever, the final shot takes your breath away.And anyway, Campion, while handling the thriller genre competently, is using it as a means to explore sexuality. And attraction. And how much of love involves physicality, carnality, trust, the desire to dominate, the desire to be dominated, and above all, the attraction of the DANGEROUS.

114,azeemak,Let's hear a cheer for a true maverick and an engrossing tale,9,2 December 2003,"Since An Angel At My Table Jane Campion hasn't made a flawless film, yet I still think she is a genius, and couldn't make a bad or uninteresting film if she tried.  The Piano was a truly Great Film.  Portrait Of A Lady was terrific apart from John Malkovich's horrible performance; Holy Smoke was an extremely brave film (who else would mix an exploration of spiritual belief, a story of forbidden love and broad Aussie slapstick, and get away with it??) with an exceptional, fearless performance from Kate Winslet.Jane Campion has coaxed another fearless performance from an estimable talent, Meg Ryan.  The thing I really like is that I never thought she was overdoing the slumming it - ""Hey everyone, this is me, cute little Meg, proving I can act by skipping the make-up and looking as ugly as I can.""  It feels like an honest performance, and she just happens to look more beautiful and desirable than ever before.  Mark Ruffalo is superb in this; I've liked him a lot ever since You Can Count On Me - even his blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameo in Ride With The Devil left a strong impression - and he's just as good here.  JJL is bearable, which is about as much as I can say about her.  And Kevin Bacon is very fine, though I haven't yet figured out why he's uncredited (I see there's a thread on that here, which I must read!).I loved the sleazy feel of the film, the cinematography and especially the editing, which really was outstanding.  The dialogue was really grown-up as well.  Not only were the sex scenes adult and sexy, but the sex talk was too - it rang true, which sex talk hardly EVER does in Hollywood films.There are flaws, and I don't think the police procedural is Campion's forte; the ending was a bit pat, I thought, although the lead-up to it was edge-of-the-seat stuff.  Overall, there is far more to get your teeth into than 90% of films.  I give it a nine, just because Jane Campion is an original and a cussed spirit.  Hollywood desperately needs more independent, maverick spirits like her.",In the Cut
115,cestleilacherradi,And the Oscar goes to... Ruffalo,9,2 January 2015,"My man! Mark Ruffalo is a good actor. And here he is just unbelievably OUTstanding. Not only is he steamy as hell in his body language when it's a matter of sex, but every detail of his performance through the movie is so right on! The tone of his voice, the movements of his hands, the way he talks, what he looks at, ...On the opposite, I have been puzzled by Meg Ryan's performance : frankly I haven't quite figured out if I have not understood what she wanted to show or if she really was uncomfortable with her character and/or if she is simply less good at playing certain things. For instance, when she's sitting touching herself, I find her very not credible. Also, when she's drunk and seems to be ready to fall, etc.Oh and in the nudity scene when they talk, it's strange when Ruffalo covers himself after Meg Ryan puts sheets back on him! It is so weird. Do you do that when you're naked with your boyfriend? I really saw as if it was the actress Meg Ryan who noticed that Mark Ruffalo's penis was visible and she noticed to him to put the sheets on him. Back to Ruffalo, I wanna emphasize that this man is underrated. I don't know why in Los Angeles the most famous actors are not the best ones. In this movie, he will be very unforgettable for me because I felt very exposed as a woman and I felt a lot of very pleasant feelings thanks to him. As for the story and all, I must say that I didn't like the blurry look of the whole image, but I loved that Campion was filming New York in a very ordinary way and the soundtrack was so original that you actually hear it, not like in those blockbusters where you don't even notice the music anymore, especially the one of the end.I find that 5 out of 10 as a general note is way too down.

117,hypersquared,A deeply effective sexual exploration - quintessentially Campion,8,29 October 2003,"There's a theory about the evolution of the very earliest living cells which imagines that sexual activity came about as an accidental variation on predatory activity. The theory goes that one cell, while trying to consume another for its nutrients instead wound up fusing half of its genetic material with the same from its prey, producing a third cell. The first case of sexual intercourse, a bungled murder.To this day, the parity of sex and violence is one of the most troublesome paradoxes in our societies and in our psyches. Yet there it is, whether appearing only metaphorical, as with images of penetration; or more visceral: the impulse to bite during sex, or of some, to act out full sado-masochistic scenarios. We rightly recoil with horror from the dreadful reality of rape, and yet so many women are drawn to bad boys, finding the dark potential for violence in a man an incomparable aphrodisiac.`In the Cut' takes place entirely in the dark fissure between lust and murderousness. It's no surprise that it's the work of Jane Campion, who seems exclusively fascinated by what makes women yearn and burn, and while it doesn't have the formal elegance of `The Piano' or the ruthless character interplay of `Holy Smoke,' it is a sensual experience (and a sensory one) like none other on display.The movie lies close to you and, like Aesop's Satyr, breathes hot and cold breath on your face at the same time. Even when the scenes are frigid -- body parts drained of blood, a frozen lake  the internal heat of the characters is palpable. The deep colors in Dion Beebe's photography, like those in `Holy Smoke,' come off of some otherworldly pallet. The focus ripples like heat distortion at the edges, keeping the outer world vague, and our attention on the characters' immediate realities.The story, such as it is, is ostensibly a murder mystery. Frannie (Meg Ryan) and her half sister, Pauline (Jennifer Jason Leigh), are potential witnesses in a serial killing being investigated by Detective Malloy (Mark Ruffalo). The sisters are late thirties, longing for husbands, and settling, respectively, for masturbation and sleeping with a married doctor. The cop is a bit of a mook, but with that comes a directness and animalism that Frannie can't entirely turn away from. Ruffalo plays him as the same kind of undereducated but acutely perceptive attraction that Campion has employed Harvey Keitel for in the past. Ruffalo's batting a thousand lately, and this is among his best work.Ultimately, the movie is pointless as a whodunit. The culprit and his motives turn out to be entirely peripheral to the central action, which is about Frannie (and Campion) exploring the psychological territory where sexual apprehension borders on fear, and where the fear legitimately becomes about more than just sex.With the aid of a beautifully understated performance from Meg Ryan (who does not for a moment appear to be trying to leave a previous image behind  she just does it), Campion and writer Susanna Moore  create a portrait of a woman's conflicting impulses when drawn to someone who is very possible no good for her, a portrait that likely mirrors to some degree experiences we've all had.",In the Cut

While watching this film, I found myself continually making comparisons with Ferrara's earlier ""Fear City"" (1984). The film is a dark, murky, and seedy exploration into the frustrated sexuality of the lead character, played by Meg Ryan who must think the world is ready to know that her perky personality comes fully accessorized with perky breasts and a perky butt. The plot is largely irrelevant, serving mostly as a means of introducing the other, essentially peripheral characters. The pacing is glacial; paint dries faster than this film moves forward. It's made even worse when one can deduce the main points after the first thirty minutes -- who will be a victim, who will turn out to be the perpetrator, who is an obvious suspect but will turn out not to be the actual killer, and so on. The photography is very good but there is far too much close-in hand-held camera work, a tedious fad among many current directors who have fallen under the spell of the European cartel of Dogme 95 adherents. (Thanks, Lars, thanks a lot.) I am no great fan of Ryan, but Jennifer Jason Leigh certainly merits being in movies better than this one. In short, I couldn't wait for this film to be over.

If they did on this picture they must have been asleep at the time. Unless of course it was the act of watching them that put them there. Which is something that will surely be relatable to anyone who has, or does, view this film.It would seem to open well enough. SEEM being a key word. We're given a stream of mildly interesting urban images that establish the setting and touch lightly upon a subtle style in the cinematography that might, that could and that eventually does, hint at the possibility of more colorful things (events)to come. However the switch to sepia by the time the title card is placed, along with the very telling opening song, are two signs of where you can expect to be by the end of this picture.Some bland, out of focus, or obscured, sex scenes are intermittently sprinkled through the story. Though not entirely for the sole purpose of simply keeping your attention, but like the rest of the performances in this film, they too seem somewhat strained.There's not really much more to say; the standard thriller technique of ""finger pointing"" at everyone and anyone, of course is present. On an up note; Jennifer Jason Leigh's performance and character are both more interesting than the convoluted story we are meant to follow. Though that may be prejudicial on my part, as I've always been fond of her talent.If you're the type who likes to have a film going in the background while you're focused on something more important, but always get frustrated because you miss the significant points of the film, then this might be just what you're looking for.

It is a challenge for me to understand what it is that so works for me yet fails to engage most people.this is not a thriller that looks into the heart of evil, and the murderer has a limited role. it is also not a movie about catching the murderer. and as such it is not comfortable viewing. what the film does is explores the effect of the proximity of evil upon its main character, frannie, and as she is hemmed in, we see her powerless in this unfamiliar world. she can no longer read the men in her life, her student, her past lover, and the investigating cop. They all appear ambivalent and violent. her world is no longer safe and the film beautifully captures frannie's loss of certainty. we feel the same adrenaline rush and heat of fear that she does. and we sense her own mistrust of the investigating detective. this mistrust evolves into desire not despite the fact that she suspects him of the murders but because she does. the sense that she wants the very man who could destroy her is unnerving but also compelling. Malloy is darkly seductive, and as frannie allows herself to fall we sense her own anxiety that the real danger comes when you allow someone in.And this is the power of the movie, frannie is a disillusioned woman who cannot believe in the romantic script. she seems to believe that women are in peril when they believe in the men they love and this keeps her on edge of experience. it is when she is thrust into murderous events that she relives these fears and realigns herself to a different script. the hardened and cold woman appears vulnerable and unsure. watching frannie do so we do not know whether she has made a huge mistake or is finding her salvation.there much to say about this movie, to talk about the wonderful performances so perfectly nuanced from both meg ryan and mark raffaelo. the extraordinary visual imagery, the films wonderful sounds and the sense of this mirky unfathomable place. it works on so many differently levels and i know that i can return to it again and again and find yet something more.",In the Cut

131,tastyworm,"Explicit, Gruesome & Nothing Special.",5,30 January 2005,"I had heard a lot of hype prior to watching this film, unfortunately, most of it was negative  so when I watched this film I tried to block out the hype and see what I thought for myself. Unfortunately, I found a lot of it justified. I usually start my reviews with a quote from the film, so it's very unfortunate that none stuck out enough as being memorable.Its storyline focuses on Frannie (Ryan), an English teacher who is fixated with poetry and language slang, who ends up getting caught up in a serial killer case when a severed head is found in her New York apartment garden. She meets Detective Malloy (Ruffalo) who is investigating said case and ends up having a steamy, sordid relationship with him while trying to avoid her ex-boyfriend (Bacon) who appears to be stalking her.In The Cut is a modern 'who dunnit' film, but instead of dropping some hints to the audience to have them suspect one or two characters, Director Jane Campion throws obvious references in your face to make you think everyone did it. While I have nothing against the characters in the film per se, and the acting of these characters throughout the film isn't too bad, I think this film just boils down to a bad storyline. I kind of liken this film to Basic Instinct with its likeness of a 'sexy serial killer flick' - and although the sexual content of the film is due to the character archetypes, it seems as if it was directed and presented for the sole purpose of creating a marketing furore and social controversy. I cannot help but think that Meg Ryan took this role to kick start her slowing career, as did perhaps Campion  who both appear to have had slight hiatuses in their respective careers at the time of production. Oddly enough, Nicole Kidman was slated for the lead role, but turned it down, preferring to stay as a producer instead.In summary? The sex is explicit, the nudity is constant, the gruesome violence is mostly done off camera, and the storyline is nothing special.",In the Cut

But, it is way too weird – the unrated version is way out there for a mainstream film.Meg Ryan, trying to break out of her nice girl image, is Frannie who cries throughout half the movie. She is a teacher who wants to sleep with a student, but does not seem to sleep with anyone until Ruffalo's Detective Malloy asks her questions about a gruesome murder.Frannie suspects Malloy, but Kevin Bacon's John Graham is a weird freak who she should also suspect.I am not sure what Jane Campion was trying to accomplish here, but it quite a tangled, sexual web that she weaves. Also, the flashbacks to Frannie's father ice skating do not make any sense to me.",In the Cut
133,herb_at_qedi,A New Campion -- But most certainly not a better one,1,13 January 2005,"Has Jane Campion reached the post-2001 Stanley Kubrick stage of her career? Is she convinced that her genius can only be expressed through relentless repetition of disquieting imagery accompanied by utter disdain for conventional contrivances such as plot or emotion? Is dialog best left to ordinary Hollywood hacks? Or, as an Australian, has she actually created a wry valentine to America's obsession with entwining erotic and illicit sex with brutally unrestrained violence? I could see where an enterprising Film Studies professor could spend an entire month studying and discussing some of these themes in contrast to Campion's earlier efforts.Other than as an examination of the director as auteur, In The Cut is one of the most relentlessly and irredeemably inept excuses for a movie that it has ever been my misfortune to watch from beginning to end. What meager plot exists is disjointed, torn asunder, then restitched incomprehensibly by Campion. The scant morsels of dialog are unreasonably profane and much too hostile for the situations as presented. All the ""acting"" seems to be a series of exercises in lyrical improvisation and rhythmic mime. The soundtrack is annoyingly random with an undertone of mockery. The pacing is THE WORST I have ever seen in a so-called thriller. In fact, on my personal overall list, I believe that this may replace Heavywights as my least favorite movie of all time -- my new Platinum Turkey Champion by Campion. But, by my own rules, doing so would require watching it two more times, and I'm not certain I could endure THAT! Not that In The Cut is devoid of novelty aspects. Approximately, 35% of the shots used in the movie include the bare breasts of Meg Ryan's character. I believe that I noticed a slight difference on the side of the left breast in one shot 2/3 the way through than in the next spot. If true, this could be a whole new reason for single guys to rent the movie. It could even become a popular frat party game: Freeze Frame - In this next shot, is that really Meg or is it her body double? Is that really Kevin Bacon in an uncredited cameo? How many new people do we get to add to the ""One Degree of Bacon"" list? Why does Meg's father have brown eyes as a young man and blue eyes when he's older? In short, this movie is so irredeemably repulsive, but with so many noteworthy quirks, that it almost must be seen to be believed. But, if you are willing to believe it without seeing it, you can probably save yourself 2 hours and 25 minutes of pure torture.",In the Cut

Her former boyfriend is a manic depressive stalker and her new, prospective boyfriend is also a prospective killer.In fact, all males in this thriller are would-be assailants. Danger lurks around the corner and is almost unavoidable. A slightly cynical picture of relationships is painted here, with the romantic myth in the cut. People have their own agendas and keep stepping over other peoples boundaries all the time. During the coarse of the film, the history of Ryans parents is revealed, starting off as a romantic cliché, but ending with the mother being ""cut in half"".This is, despite Campions sensitive touch and beautiful images, a film that perhaps bites of a bit more than it can chew (and Im not talking about the oral sex scene here). The basic crime story is banal, serving as a backdrop for ponderings on romance, relationships and sex. This is perhaps most clearly manifested as Ryan and her sister, played by Jennifer Jason-Leigh, confide in each other in a strip-club apartment. Its not a bad film though and may be viewed as a series of moods, spoken words and pretty pictures. Ryan actually works quite well in this part.As a side-note, Ryan was scythed by British talk-show host Michael Parkinson for making this film, while appearing as a guest on his show. Parkinson said that the film goes against everything that he thinks is worthwhile about love. This more than anything shows that the film does have some potency, can stir things up and may have something relevant to say to people.",In the Cut
135,WheezyJoe,Lurid Desire,8,13 January 2004,"`In the Cut' is nerve wrenchingly dark and skilfully strips away anything that stereotypes Meg Ryan's film presence and on screen demeanour. I was quickly put in my place when my humble expectations fell flat by gripping realism not felt this explicit since `Se7en.' It's that sense of `realism' that lets the film go beyond its formula and truly lets you in on what's being said. It's a murder mystery that doesn't concentrate heavily on who done it. That's just a passenger to the handful of characters, specifically Frannie Thorstin, and to drive you along thus developing those characters via circumstance and events. The team responsible for `In The Cut' behind and in front of the camera dig deep and personal to give an amazing effort. Firstly, and squarely in the spot light, is Meg Ryan with a tough role dual-sided and unyielding. The movie is hers and she carries it well. If anything the movie must be commended on the central performance by Ryan who is not only daring but also very genuine and dynamic. Co-actor Mark Ruffalo who plays Detective Giovanni Malloy is an equal opposite to Ryan's character Frannie and serves as equilibrium as both actors play off of one another. There is danger around every corner in this movie and both Malloy and Frannie have conflicting emotions. But it's Frannie who also fears Malloy despite her attraction to him that is the iron grip of the narrative. The two actors are perfectly cast and do a brilliant job. I must also mention Kevin Bacon too because he always makes for a good eerie yet highly suspicious ex-boyfriend type. In fact he has a great little part that helped make the entire film. There are a few other supporting actors to credit but needless to say they are all great. I heard some pretty downbeat remarks about `In The Cut' from various critics and it's got a pretty bad wrap in general (mostly due to Meg Ryan for some odd reason). To say that `In The Cut' is clear-cut would be wide of the mark. The story lies beneath the surface in a physiological ditch close to home and that can be discouraging if you're not ready for it. Meg Ryan is incredible, award winning incredible, in a provocative and very revealing role that can be grim, frightening and erotic simultaneously. I have not read the original novel but apparently there are modest changes, the kind of changes that are often made to adaptations to play better in the medium. Jane Campion has quite successfully let the visuals tell much of the story together with incredible cinematography by Dion Beebe that borders on art house. Judging by the mixed reactions, the subject matter and the very subjective title itself it's a movie that will take you somewhere not everybody is willing to go. Don't be put off by negative comments directed at this film; it's a movie that connects to people in their own way. All I will say is see it for yourself, on the big screen preferably, and try and understand what is being said and explored rather than expecting anything in particular.Score - 4 out of 5",In the Cut
136,marioonline,Cut into good and bad pieces.,8,14 January 2004,"I have often discussed with movie-goers whether it is possible to slice a single movie into parts to make statements like: ""the director is very good, but the cast...oh my god"", or ""that screenplay rocked, but the editor was definitely having problems"".Well, this is it. ""In the cut"" I found the answer: yes. Some aspects of this movie are good, some other are not, as follows.Thumbs up items from ""In the cut"":1) The gorgeous titles, Jane Campion has always been extremely good at it. (See ""Portrait of a Lady"") 2) The visuals in general. Every scene is a treat for the eye, both in beautiful (e.g.: Jennifer Jason Leigh at the beginning) and in awful (e.g.: Meg Ryan in the end) circumstances. Again, Campion is a master.3) The psychology of female characters. I think the movie provides a great insight of how a woman's mind can work (Let us all forget ""What women want""). At least this is the impression that I get as a man. The most effective examples are the two sisters' dialogs and the love scenes. Well, Campion is a lady, after all!Shortcomings ""in the cut"":4) The psychology of male characters. Yes, Campion is all woman. Probably this movie provides another proof of the fact that Venus and Mars are very distant planets: there are four men playing some significant role, and none of them has more psychological depth than an ash tray. They are like dumb puppets filling the gaps between female characters' lines.
5) The ""thriller"" plot. After all, this movie is supposed to be a thriller. Well, from that point of view it simply fails. The final ""oh my"" revelation is simply silly. It makes sense ""per se"", but it doesn't match the high quality of the rest of the movie (I am always taking the assumption of slice-ableness of movies).So, this movie is a so-and-so thriller, but it has many other qualities that make it worth a try.",In the Cut

This film is vulgar and disturbing, partly because it pretends to be something it's not.  And what it is would best be forgotten.

140,pf9,A movie about female sexuality served up as a film noir,7,26 November 2003,"Two movies are being screened here, a run of the mill slasher with all the usual predictable trappings, filmed in gorgeous dark shades as a somewhat botched film noir, and a much more interesting movie about the sexual needs of a mature woman. The sex scenes between Meg Ryan and Mark Ruffalo have something very unusual about them. The format we are used to in the movies is: man pursues woman, seduces her, and ends up getting his way with her and meeting his needs. Here everything is viewed from the woman's point of view and the sex act is not a ""conquest"" by a man, but a woman's conscious and deliberate pursuit of her own sexual needs. She is in control at all times. In a voyeuristic encounter early in the movie the man literally becomes the woman's sex object in precisely the  politically incorrect way that we have been taught to condemn as exploitation of women, when the tables are turned. For a male viewer it takes some time getting used to --- I would say it is even somewhat disconcerting, if not outright disturbing in the beginning --- but once you realize and accept what is going on, it fascinates in an entirely novel manner. This topic certainly deserves further exploration and Jane Campion deserves full credit for having raised it.",In the Cut

In our opinion, the fact that a film is directed by a woman (or a book has a feminine author, or a political party is led by a woman) does not at all mean that the feminine perpective is present.   You can still be served the male/macho approach to life.  Margaret Thatcher comes to mind. Ditto for the producer/director of this film.""In the cut"" (what a silly, meaningless title!) is pure sexual exploitation. It is hard not to believe that the purpose of that film was to make money showing a celebrity in the nude.  A ghastly murder is committed in close proximity and what is this university professor most interested in ?  The detective's sexual organ! (spoiler) And the exploitation borders on irresponsibility.  The detective describes in detail the technique and tools used by the murderer to sever the head of the principal character's sister.  Come on!!  Apart from having no sense of reality, doesn't this director have any feeling of responsibility towards the possible consequences of her actions like most of us have?The camera work is hugely distracting.  It is as if the director of photography decided that every trick and effect that theequipment allows would be included in the film.  The impression is that he or she kept trying to remind viewers, that, hey, he or she is there working very hard.After two hours of this slow and boring stuff, a black screen appeared.

The subject matter is handled with a lot more delicacy then it might seem.The performances are brilliant, including the unexpected appearance of Kevin Bacon in an important and unnerving role.Campion is an expert at exploring the sexuality of women, as well as empowering them. It was so refreshing to see a female protagonist shed herself of what could have been another stereotypical male, detective hero.Some people have called this film 'crap' and 'garbage'. It is extremely clear that they have missed the point and ultimately reduce themselves to being shallow neanderthals.This is an amazing film by a fearless film maker.

There was no sustained tension to speak of, no humor to break up the monotony, no likable characters, just a few pointless and really tiresome sex scenes scattered throughout a terrible story with lots and lots of talk about sex.And what's with Meg Ryan's long walk to Manhattan from the lighthouse, across the George Washington Bridge while she's drunk, covered with blood?

145,ForVirg,Looking for a thriller? Watch Mr. Brooks instead,3,9 December 2011,"Right off the bat I must say that I agree with another reviewer here who mentioned Jennifer Jason Leigh's performance and character as the bright spot in this dismal (literally and figuratively) movie.I've never been a huge fan of Leigh's, but she does a terrific acting job with what she's been handed. Also, her character is the only human who ever smiles at all through the entirety of this dark-and-dismal-merely-for-the-sake-of-being-dark-and-dismal movie.And there is my first criticism. It is far more effective to let the flow of natural human behavior take the viewer to a troubling place in the psyche than it is to try to do so by skipping story development and just having all the characters behave morose and bizarrely at all times and by using shadowy lighting.This movie made me feel very sad for Meg Ryan. I actually watched the film solely because I thought it would be good to see Ryan have a chance to exercise her acting muscles instead of once again playing the formulaic perky romantic interest role that has made her famous.Actually, Ryan IS very talented and would be excellent in a robustly dark role. I wish she would have chosen a more well-written script than this predictable and boring yawner.This movie lives way down to my lowest expectations of modern movie-making with all the attendant predictable moments: sex scenes where power and dominance game playing between the partners is supposed to create intense tension (have these writers never had an actual moment of intense sexual attraction allowed to simmer? It doesn't appear that way, so sad for them); blurry and shaky camera work that is supposed to add I don't know what exactly; and dark, dismal, depressed and angry people who apparently have zero personality.It is this last criticism which bothers me the most about this horrible waste of time. I'm no fan of predictability in modern films, but when that predictability is presented within a story of one-dimensional characters with less depth of personality than a computer game character, it is beyond frustrating.There is no shortage of talented and imaginative writers in this world.

In fact, that might have been a better way to go.

152,kevin-477,Disappointingly average (may contain spoilers),6,25 September 2005,"Beautifully shot, well acted, a sharp script and a good soundtrack... yet somehow, none of this compensates for the main weaknesses of the film: the flimsy story, the lack of drama and the unlikely relationship between the two central characters. For me, the narrative lost its drive about a third of the way in, once the identity of the killer became obvious. At first I thought this was a deliberate red herring... but sadly not. And once you've sussed out who it is, all tension and drama seem to seep away. Even the conflict between the Meg Ryan and Mark Ruffalo characters doesn't keep it going, because the main source of that conflict - her doubt about him - has by this time dissipated. I never believed in their relationship for one moment anyway: a shy, sensitive, middle-class liberal English teacher and a hard, sexist, possibly homicidal detective. I know opposites are meant to attract, but it still didn't chime. Why would any woman in Ryan's position get into a relationship with someone whom she suspected might want to cut her head off a bit later on? Because the oral sex scene turned her on and she fancied a bit of rough to put some zing back into her lonely life? Nah. For me, the most believable - and erotically-charged - relationship in the film was between Meg Ryan and Jennifer Jason Leigh. The long scene where they're together in the flat, half-drunk, scantily-dressed, comforting one another, was brilliantly done. Altogether, the performances couldn't be faulted, with special credit, I think, to Ruffalo. And also to Kevin Bacon, who played a brilliantly off-beam cameo piece.If the story had been tightened up, this could have been a good film. True, the other elements make the film very watchable... but once the narrative tension has gone, it simply becomes very nice to look at. That may be enough for some people.

I know Meg Ryan's character is supposed to be bland and timid, but she's also supposed to have some fire burning within, some unfulfilled desire that makes her enter into a risky affair (remember Diane Keaton in 'Looking For Mr. Goodbar?). She shows this in her sex scenes, but none in other moments. Mark Ruffalo? Wonderful performance, if being both wooden and extremely repellent at the same time was the requirement. Kevin Bacon, slumming once again (he seems determined to make 'Three Degrees of Kevin Bacon WAY to easy to play) provides the only interesting performance, but his character is such an obvious red herring that the fun of it diminishes under the formula. The worst offense, however, is the total lack of motive for the killings. 'In the Cut' is apparently (and I'm just guessing here) a skating reference, but what's the point? All the sturm and drang about the mother and father's romance on skates, and the ridiculous dream sequence...why? After nearly two hours spent with ugly characters in ugly surroundings amidst ugly circumstances, there is no payoff, no explanation, no insight. Yuchh.Later: I read the book. Somehow I was compelled. And it made this abortion of a movie all the more egregious since the author had a hand in it. The book was honest and compelling and had an ending that was DEVESTATING and COMPLETELY in sync with the rest of the story. Why, why, why, do these filmmakers think they can't offer an honest, violent, sad ending to an American audience? This sell-out on the part of the author ranks right up there with the one inflicted by the director of both the original 'The Vanshing' and the US remake.

It seems that the more movies I watch, the more movies I despise.'In The Cut' is quite possible the poorest excuse for film ever. It was nothing more than a glorified indie porn, in my opinion. The story is not all that great, though I will give it this much, there was nothing as obvious as it seemed. Meg Ryan is actually a talented actress, but you wouldn't know it by this film. Mark Ruffalo I guess we could say did his job, but there wasn't anything else to his character other than what they wanted you to believe about him. That doesn't aid in plot development. My only hope is that the original novel was better crafted than this poor excuse for a film.",In the Cut
157,jonie v.,Pleasure and Fear: Campion's Guide to Female Eroticism ***SPOILERS***,9,2 November 2003,"In Jane Campion's films, women are stunted communicators. They are overwhelmed by larger-than-life men in the presence of whom their words are clearly futile, not to be uttered. In In the Cut the protagonist Frannie is an English professor who collects the words of others but does not have much to say on her own account. She is silenced inside by a bewildered fear of people-men-which she carries around in the form of a great vulnerability. As we see her in the streets of New York, in the bars, on the train, in her house, we are struck by how small and fragile she looks, a beautiful thing in a very rough world. Frannie is constantly pondering over the little poems, or fragments of poems, the transit authority posts in the New York subway trains. She is also writing a book on slang words, which she gathers by regularly meeting a black student in a seedy restaurant-bar. The words are very much not her own words, part of a culture she studies as an outsider. In her home, she meticulously posts words and sentences on cork boards on the walls. When the cop who will become her lover first enters her place, the first thing he notices are the words. When he leaves, he leaves behind a new word, `disarticulated,' which Frannie hastens to scribble down and put up with the others.Disarticulated, or inarticulate, is, in fact, what Frannie is. She cannot articulate her unease, and stumbles through a traumatized post-9/11 New York in a state of shell-shocked withdrawal. Along with her unease, she cannot articulate her desire. Pauline, her sister, who knows her well, pressures her into dating men, presumably because she doesn't. Pauline herself, who lives surrounded by sex because her apartment is literally  above a go-go bar and she's close to the girls, is in love with a doctor who sleeps with her but does not love her back and whom she sees mainly by making doctor's appointments. Frannie's and Pauline's lives are filled with desire and sensuality. Their houses are steeped in color and sound, wonderfully cozy houses, not expensive but lusciously decorated with red shag carpets and piles of soft cushions. At the beginning of the film, Frannie's and Pauline's desire shows itself in their love for each other. Since we don't know the two are sisters (half-sisters, actually), we think Pauline is Frannie's lover. The two women touch a lot, walk holding hands, part with a loud kiss on the mouth. The play of their hands, their touch, their physical proximity dominates all the scenes in which they appear together in the film. In the meantime, the doctor Pauline is in love with is seeking a restraining order against her. The idea that she may be issued a restraining order feels absurd to Pauline, who tells Frannie the story in grief and disbelief. Looking at Frannie and Pauline huddled up in Pauline's apartment, it feels absurd to us, too: theirs is clearly a world in which women have a lot more to fear from men than men from women.Men are portrayed from the start and consistently as dangerous predators. The student Frannie meets in the bar is cocky and macho, and Frannie looks remarkably vulnerable sitting with him with her professorial glasses on. In the back of the room, women giggle with a guy or two. When Frannie goes to the restroom, she gets lost in the back of the bar and comes across a woman giving a man a blow job. The scene is, again, filled with menace. At the same time, Frannie is attracted to it, and look on, unseen. When she comes back to her table her student is gone, sent away by a mixture of impatience and jealousy.These threatening men (besides the student, who will later try to rape Frannie, there's Frannie ex-boyfriend, who breaks into her house, and of course the cop and his partner) serve the purpose of the film, which, as a slasher thriller, means to keep us guessing which one of the guys is the serial murderer who strangles women, rips their throats open, and cuts them to pieces. Juxtaposed to Frannie's desire, though, this pervasive sense of male threat functions at a deeper level, because it provides a context to her inwardness and isolation. When Frannie finally gets her detective into bed, Campion does a great job of making the intensely erotic and explicit lovemaking all about Frannie and her pleasure. Molloy's own pleasure is not even addressed. The sex is all about Frannie and her delight. In his review of the film, Rene Rodriguez of the Miami Herald describes the sex in the film as cold. I am not surprised, though I think he is dead wrong. The film's exceptional eroticism may fail to register, or register fully, on the American viewer's radar screen because its polarities are subverted. I never thought of this before seeing this scene, but in fact movie sex scenes (the heterosexual ones) are all about the man's conquest of the woman. The man fucks the woman. In In the Cut, Frannie fucks the detective, not in the sense that he is passive (he isn't), but in the sense that the whole scene is about her pleasure, her desire. So the typical parameters along which we are trained to register eroticism on the screen do not work here, because there is no sense of male conquest, no taking over of the female body. The female body is possessed only of its own pleasure, a pleasure Molloy serves. The camera is focused on Frannie's face, on her gestures and expression of sexual delight-and these are conveyed rather restrainedly in terms of movie conventions, without moans or grunts and little verbal ejaculations. Frannie moans only when she gives herself an orgasm, not when Molloy gives it to her. Also, and significantly, Frannie is the one who initiates the lovemaking, in a matter-of-fact, unromantic way that is atypical of this kind of movies. So it requires a different mindset to appreciate the eroticism of In the Cut, a mindset focused on the pleasure of women rather than on the pleasure of men.Besides wanting to hurt women, men want to own them. This theme runs through the film as a constant thread. Pauline's and Frannie's father, whom we see in sepia-colored sequences ice skating with the woman who's destined to be Frannie's mother, fell in love with her on a frozen pond while he was already engaged to another woman. The woman, disgusted by her fiancee's behavior, threw her engagement ring on the ice. The man picked it up and, half an hour later, put it on the hand of his new conquest. The sepia-colored sequences return two or three times. Just to make sure that we get it, Campion has the ice-skating father run over his new fiancee, cutting her to pieces with the sharp blades of her skates. The men who want to own women are the same men who will cut them to pieces. Molloy also asks Frannie to get engaged to him, as will the serial killer before she kills him and ends the movie. So Frannie is constantly fighting: to protect herself from male violence and to retain her independence. When, towards the end, Molloy, apparently frustrated by Frannie's silences and withdrawal, shouts at her that she's exhausting him, she locks him to a drain-pipe with his handcuffs and fucks him. The sex, as before, is about her, not his pleasure.
Frannie doesn't win her battle. The ravaged city of New York is too far gone, too lost in violence and horror, for a small woman like her to right things. But, as in her other films, Campion shows us a woman who reappropriates her desire without emasculating her partner or turning away from men altogether. This is a great victory unto itself.",In the Cut

I especially liked the many details, some of them I only discovered when I watched the movie a second time. Meg Ryan gives a very good performance, though I liked her acting better in Proof of Life'.  I didn't really like how she looked in In the Cut', though her appearance fits her role as the teacher perfectly. The movie has quite some sex, violence and strong language but in no way offensive.",In the Cut
159,dannycantwakeup,Bravo Ruffalo!,7,22 October 2003,"Bad slow movie from a mediocre slow novel.  Having already read the novel In The Cut, I went into this film already knowing the ending which made the movie drag even more than it already does.  I think the main problem with both the film and the novel is that the character of Frannie (played by barely adequate Meg Ryan) is really spread thin.  There are aspects of her repressed sexuality that a woman can relate to but it's always followed by inexplicably stupid behavior.  Also the serial killer subplot (and it really is only a subplot) is never as haunting or scary as it needs to be. 
God Bless Mark Ruffalo.  God Bless Him Forever.  I am probably the hugest fan he has and he was beautiful in this film.  Finally, he has molded himself a meaty and manly character he deserves to be playing. He did the character of Malloy justice which I seriously doubted was possible after reading the novel.  Unfortunately this character is in a film that doesn't want to focus on how Malloy affects Frannie but how screwed up and traumatized Frannie is.  Although can I suggest that he stops using mustaches?The cinematography of the film was also commendable.  The way New York was shot by Dion Beebe was gorgeous and moving.  It has been a while since the City has been so lovingly exposed for what it really is.  He should be recognized for his work here because he crafts a clearer narrative through his images than Campion does in any shot or dialogue.  I am not a fan of Campion's.  I wish there were younger and hungrier female directors out there who could give us a study of urban females' sexual anxiety.
The ending has been changed from the novel which I have to say I am grateful for because in the context of this film I would have left feeling suicidal if they'd actually gone through with it.  But they left out my favorite scene from the book (I'm assuming because of MPAA-rating reasons).",In the Cut
160,dannycantwakeup,on second thought,7,24 November 2003,"I wrote a review of this film praising Mark Ruffalo's performanceabout a month ago.  And the more I think about it (and I think aboutMark Ruffalo a lot) the more I think he's not very good in this movie. It's not that he doesn't do an excellent job with that character.  And,considering that most of this film is absolutely ridiculous, he doesemerge unscathed.  But he is miscast.  ***spoilers below****Ruffalo has this drive to be liked.  I feel that the number oneemotion he is trying to extract from the audience is sympathy.  Andthis is an unlikeable character.  He's sexy and rough around theedges and mysterious and NOT a nice guy deep down.  What wasinteresting about the novel was that I found myself hoping Malloywas the killer.  Hoping he would eventually kill this self-destructivetime-bomb of a woman.  Unfortunately, Ruffalo's Malloy is not thatdifferent from Terry in You Can Count on Me or Cole in XX/XY.  Theyare just guys who can't help the fact that they screw over thepeople they love.  They are completely emasculated charactersthat Ruffalo makes memorable because he still retains theirmasculinity.  In conclusion, Ruffalo innately defers suspicion thathe is the killer.  No matter how many curse words he uses and nomatter what dirty things he does to Meg Ryan.  Deep down he's just trying to do the right thing.  Catch the bad guy.  Even if it isn'tobvious the first time around, the final image says it all. Handcuffed to a pole.  Completely powerless.

Do not take any sharp objects into the theater or you may try to commit hari-kari before the end of this one.

162,thomaswatchesfilms,unfocused,4,28 March 2004,"I thought that this film attempted to draw tension between the characters both sexually and in the context of the grisly murders, but had the content and depth to accomplish neither. Ruffalo does a superb job as the New York Cop, but less so as a vulnerable, sensitive, sex-driven would be suitor. Leigh's character lacks the depth to evoke the sympathy needed to ultimately bring about the film's climactic scenes, and this effects, in turn, the effectiveness of Ryan's character, and the plot in general.The sex scenes, while designed, clearly, to deepen the gritty, sex noir feel of the film become more voyeuristic in the sense that their content is overshadowed by the fact that hey, this is Meg Ryan, ""America's Sweetheart"", and she's doing.....what?? Although this was an attempt on Ms. Ryan's part to shed that wholesomeness, the attempt falls short somehow. While convincingly erotic, the scenes don't quite add up to shocking in their sexual content, vis-a-vis ""9 1/2 Weeks"" or even ""Angel Heart"". More sex and more murder may have lifted this film over the hurdles of slow dialog and undeveloped characterization; an unfortunate equation.Three characters were underdeveloped, purposely, it seems, to deepen the mystery behind the characters' motivations as related to the sex and murder in the film. But two were complete blind alley parts, and short ones at that, including Kevin Bacon as the troubled intern. And one, the character who eventually winds up being the murderer, is almost completely undeveloped. You can't have it both ways. you either need to have the murderer come completely out of the blue, or you need to develop that character enough for the audience to actually care that he or she has done so. Could have been better, but I don't know how. I suppose that seeing it again might clarify my thoughts, but it wasn't good enough to take the time to do so. Perhaps, and perhaps by way of rationalization, the poor quality of this review does more to illustrate the film's shortcomings than anything.Half baked.",In the Cut

At first, we have the framing, witch is very tiring, with the continuous close - ups and the hand held camera only makes things worse. Blurring things or dimming the lights does not, I repeat does not creates atmosphere, it only shows luck of creativeness together with a very old fashion approach in film making. Showing us again and again every detail of the faces of the actors does not engage us more, it only makes us want to zoom out ourselves to see wtf is going on. The music is so academic that it doesn't exist. Worst of all: The dialogs. The film crawls all the way from the beginning to the bitter end and the dialogs are drugging it the other way. What can I say? Together with Holy Smoke, a film that ruined the talented Harvey Keitel and Kate Winslet, (a tragedy really), In The Cut is so pointless that makes you wonder, was she really thinking making them?

Bits of body are found in Meg Ryans garden, yet she'd be more upset if she ran out of condoms. Enter Detective Ruffalo (quite literally) who has a dirty mouth which Ryan thinks is sweet-talk (if she just wanted sex she could sleep with Bacon's nutter/stalker, but we're led to believe Ryan wants something more meaningful). Ryan and Ruffalo's first date is a threesome with his unhinged partner who makes some yawnsomely homophobic and mysogynistic remarks all in one breath, and Ryan picks up her dirty mac and goes off to get mugged and runover. Let's face it she was asking for it. Ruffalo likes his women bruised and ingratiates himself into Ryan's bed to graphically explain how he knows how to do what he does so well to women, in the toilet department. One can only imagine that his teacher was canine, as he proceeds to sniff Ryan's bottom. She is soon obsessed, meanwhile pushing away potentially better suitors who are all afflicted with character deficiences e.g obsession with serial killers, obsession with Ryan... No-one in Ryan's life is allowed to be normal.Ryan pads out her blissfully romantic life by copying (badly translated)Poetry on the Underground onto a scrappy notepad and improving herself with a 'Word-a-day' calender. Did I mention she's supposed to be an English teacher? Yet the work of Dante has evaded her, and she can't even hazard a guess what the word 'disarticulate' might mean in reference to the cutting up of the aforementioned serial-killers' victims' bodies.Oh, that's right! I forgot. This is a murder mystery, yet it's fairly easy to work out, even though everyone in New York is made out to be a suspect.This really is the most charmless bunch of individuals ever to grace the screen. Campion, obviously upset that (producer) Nicole Kidman couldn't do it, styles Ryan to look like Kidman. Ryan, almost always naked, looks uncomfortable in her own apartment (this is not the first time she's been nude - she was topless in The Doors - all you freaks who are dribbling over the prospect can go and freezeframe that) and has a problem keeping hold of her shoes.Shoes play an important part in Ryan's life. Flat & frumpy by day, killer heels by night - but she will keep losing one, like she has some weird Cinderella complex hoping that her Prince will come. You know those shoes you see in the street and on top of bus shelters, and you wonder where they come from? They're all Meg Ryan's.But by far the worst performance in this film is New York itself. Dirty, grimy, sleazy as Campion tries to give us her 'Taxi Driver', her 'Mean Streets', but really only manages to deliver an explicit 'Cagney and Lacey'.",In the Cut

They are not dolls or perfect, they are realistically flawed, yet are beautiful in all their complexity. Mark Ruffalo gives Detective Molloy a dangerous and deceptive feeling, but he too is written with depth. The camera diffuses colour and each shot is contructed to add to character.

You may have heard something of the films sex scenes, which are indeed surprisingly graphic for a mainstream film, but they are too edgy and paranoid to be erotic, at least for my taste.  I've heard this film compared to *Looking for Mr. Goodbar* (1977), an apt measure, but if I had to choose, I'd go to *Goodbar* first.  Meg Ryan is better than I had expected.

But the film is beautifully paced, and directed by a master of the medium. This is a worthy addition to Campion's oeuvre. The night- time scenes outdoors in NYC are visually striking, especially when it is raining. Meg Ryan's insecure, withdrawn, armored character was the perfect foil for her ""charming"" sex-kitten roles. In this film she is a mature woman coming to grips with issues of repression and sexuality. Jennifer Jason Leigh's role as the wild sister is masterfully done as well. And Mark Rufallo's hard-boiled detective is played to perfection. The script is great as well. Nothing gratuitous occurs. The nudity and sex scenes are believable and are erotic without being needlessly prurient or overtly violent. They are believable and lovely. Perhaps this is because it is a woman who is directing the action in bed. Mark's character learned about sex as a teen, from an older woman who he regards kindly. He is respectful and caring despite being 100% macho cop. Kevin Bacon is wonderful as a scorned - and neurotic - lover. Sharrieff Pugh as a black student of Franny's is both sensitive, aggressive, and compelling to watch. The only flaw that I have with the film is that Franny (Meg) doesn't ask certain questions that to the viewer seem obvious. But if she did ask them early on the film would have been much shorter, and that would have been a shame. While the plot has some obvious turns, there is enough tension to keep the viewer involved. I won't answer the critics who didn't like the movie. If you are a fan of film noir and don't mind nudity you will love this film. I certainly did.

Meg Ryan was an odd choice for replacement(can't blame her for wanting to do something other than romantic comedy-- she is a very, very good comedienne but this wasn't much of a showcase for her talents) and I got bored with her, I'm afraid. And what was with the stringy hair? I would have cast Jennifer Jason Leigh in the lead instead of the 2nd female, because she's also good at playing neurotics. Mark Ruffalo was as sexy as I've ever seen him. Kevin Bacon is effective in a very small part, but in the end, this thriller was all atmosphere, gross special effects and little else. Not really worth the trouble.",In the Cut
179,gabrielle-4,Campion is a masterful filmmaker - worth seeing,9,12 April 2004,"Very interesting movie.  Campion is a master at psychological drama and at storytelling.  This movie captures the sense of RISK in life -- the close-ups, the out of focus shots, the moving camera, and the sense of NOT seeing everything -- it represented masterfully a woman's sense of risk in her life -- of the tiny decisions from minute to minute that can lead to danger or safety, even if we are barely thinking about them.  Also the decisions that can become dangerous before we know it.  It's a remarkable film in that artistry.  It's only too bad that the ending had to become a cop-and-crime-thriller movie ending -- I am glad that the ending is as it turns out (rather than, I hear, how the book ends the story), but I have a feeling that Campion, if she'd had total control, would have ended this more ambiguously.  Still, she's a remarkable filmmaker even in these constraints, and this is perhaps one of Ryan's best performances.  This is not your typical Meg Ryan movie at all, of course! -- it's disturbing, so get in that mood.  Very worth seeing.",In the Cut
180,Canhenha,reinvention,8,25 January 2004,"Jane Campion's latest film continues her personal voyage through women's universe, using as backdrop the thriller. It's fascinating to see her previous efforts (from ""Sweetie"", ""An Angel at My Table"", ""The Piano"", ""Portrait of a Lady"" to ""Holy Smoke""), and to realize this one is a wonderful companion piece to all of them. Meg Ryan's character is in the same vein as her previous heroines - women seeking their own space, that find in men an obstacle or an accomplice, seeking the ultimate love that will liberate them. The sexuality here comes as a form of communication and extending their own barriers and touching someone (the longing that Jennifer Jason Leigh's character feels). I found this film beautifully filmed and acted, particularly by all the four leads, the wonderful Meg Ryan, Mark Ruffalo, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Kevin Bacon. There's a striking beauty in the way this film was shot, and if for that alone, it should be seen and admired. Since it has so much more and is accomplished in so many other levels, please do see it.",In the Cut

183,callapm66,Campion's best film,3,10 January 2004,In The Cut is probably Jane Campion's best film to date. There is little of the sentimentality that is often in her earlier films. She takes a lot of risks with this film and I think has shocked a lot of people with this brave move to break away from period drama and go straight to the ugly side of human nature. There is nothing black and white in this story and sexuality is explored in a truly shocking yet revealing way.,In the Cut
184,Profrplum,"A worthwhile study of the evolution of Meg Ryan. Overall, there's no ""there, there.""",8,1 November 2003,"This movie stars, among others, Meg Ryan.  But if that conjures up images of ditzy, or at least if not ditzy somewhat self-contented, blondes, be disadvised.  This is clearly something of an effort on the part of Meg Ryan to distance herself from her general image of the perky, maybe bright, but relentlessly perky, blonde.  Think ""Sleepless in Seattle,"" which, incidentally, I really like.She's gone brownhair and all seriouslike.  Her life is difficult, and then maybe she dies.  It's all complicated, and there are all these women getting killed, and there's this cop (extremely well-played by Mike Ruffalo, who might be up for awards for this movie if there's justice in the world) who has the downplayed hots for Meg, and there's a lot of pretty well-done sex. Quite a lot.  Really a lot.I like the movie well enough, and respect the plotting enough, that I'm not giving up the ending.  No spoiler here.  But the whole thing leaves me feeling sort of like I've visited Oakland and validated Julia Stein's comment about it.  They just should have been able to do more with it.Nevertheless, Meg Ryan and Ruffalo do superb work.  It's worth seeing for them alone, if you don't object to explicit sex and about 568,582 uses of the word ""fuck.""Oh.  I didn't say anything about what it was about, you say?  Hm.  You have a point.It's about murder of female persons most foul, involving a word that is like ""dismemberment"" but different and which you should learn from the movie. It's about an English teacher who is idealistic but also cynical about how the world really works.  It's about blowjobs (a word used in the movie and hence appropriate in a review on the Net), and about figuring out how it's possible to work things out with men even though you're really fearful of them due to your father.  It's about a really noir view of the underside of New York City.  And all of those things are well-done.  But, again, it's also about a void left at the end of the affair.  I walked out of the theater wondering just why I'd been there, even though I didn't resent the time spent at all.  But why was I there?  I haven't figured that one out yet, which means I haven't figured out why this expensively produced movie with lots of star power was made.But I note, again, I didn't walk out feeling unhappy.  May have to come back to this as I think about it later.  I gave it a ""7,"" but if I can change that, I might try after more thought.  Complex working, there.But, again, it's reasonable to say that it's mainly about a pretty successful effort on the part of Meg Ryan to let us know she can be something besides Tom Hanks's potential wife.  No cute little chirps here, although those Meg Ryan lips remain those Meg Ryan lips no matter what. It's OK; it's what you do with them that matters (*chuckle*) and not what they look like in the abstract, that counts.Certainly at least worth a matinee performance.  Not a really great date flick, though, unless you're already seriously involved.  Then a pretty good one, because it could get you talking about the meaning of different relationship tactics and activities.",In the Cut

186,mrblimp,psychological thriller vs. visually stylistic art flick,6,26 April 2005,"In the Cut ""In the Cut"" Meg Ryan, Jennifer Jason Leigh.The film is touted as a psychological thriller in which the main character increasingly becomes afraid of her selected love interest while at the same time desiring him - throughout she is wary about the motives of the various men with whom she has contact-a s well as her own motives - but is more of a detective serial murder mystery with what appears to be a switch: The Ryan role is the main character as well as a possible victim or maybe even The Victim.Although I found this film to be slow, especially during the sex scenes, with a little too much total nudity of Ryan, to the point where one would question this role as a career choice (or possibly lack of career choices), the film was extremely artistic with tons of knock you over the head non-subtlety all filmed in a very visually stylistic form from the opening credit pedals falling dreamlike scene to the scene where the climax ended. Ryan poignantly portrays the New York City teacher, possibly wannabe writer, who, lost in her own seemingly dead-end sensual non-sensual (introduced by answering no to her sister's questioning of ""Do you feel happy when you wake up every day"") world and confused by her choices (the detective, his partner, her student, her seemingly psychopathic ex-boyfriend) believes she is investigating the darker side of passion (metaphorically depicted in the subway poetry she is drawn to) by becoming involved with a sexually ambivalent homicide detective as an almost directive by which she can follow her half sister's suggestion to fulfill the ""get dick into her"" role that she herself hadn't been able to fulfill.Unfortunately, the plot seems to be full of improbabilities and the audience is asked to accept action that either don't seem to fit, have no reason for existing, or are at odds with all of the character's development: A young woman is decapitated head is left in Ryan's garden, a location point that doesn't make any sense in light of where the other bodies are dumped and only acts as the plot vehicle initiator of the relationship between Ryan's character and the detective, as neither did the latter selections of victims unless the killer's focus had always been the Ryan character herself, under which circumstances the first killing doesn't made any sense.Ryan's character collects sentences, sayings and new slang as a hobby that describes as being passionate about words which, although appeared as if it would blossom into a good plot point never does and in actuality never seemed to have anything to really do with the story. She never uses any of the ideas that she seemed to get a hold of and by the end of the film this plot sub-story not only doesn't have an ascertainable point but the audience is led far enough away from it that it becomes completely forgotten. Other then acting as an attempt to further develop the character and give her some more substantial reality its only reason for existence was as some link ""to the dark"" side of her passion and as both a metaphor and reason to follow-up on the men she is attracted to.Her half-sister Pauline played by Jennifer Jason Leigh is vividly a confused and possibly unstable woman, yet Ryan's character not only follows her advise but seems to desire her lifestyle and look. Their close friendship is never explained and doesn't seem to make any sense and one would rightly expect Ryan's character to straighten her step sister out instead of blindly accepting and encouraging her to the point of flippantly laughing at the sister's announcement that her ex-lover's wife is taking out an order of protection to restrain her from what is obviously stalking like it was a fun happening aspect of her step sister's lifestyle that she wished she herself had.",In the Cut

Meg Ryan and Mark Ruffalo both did a great job; it was refreshing to see her play a different role than ditzy blonde heartthrob. It wasn't the deepest move I've ever seen, but it was visually pleasing (albeit pretty gory) and there was a certain sense of something I can't put my finger on that made me attracted to the whole thing.

As a matter of fact, I watched this with eight friends and we pretty much had it figured out by the halfway point in the movie. Another major problem with the film was that it was too dingy and the characters were too ridiculously disturbed which made the film completely unbelievable.

190,wiehls,IGNORE THE CRITICS AND SEE IT,8,31 October 2003,"""In the Cut"" is a VERY sexy movie that continues some of the themes Jane Campion explored in ""The Piano"" (my favorite movie ever) about what women want and how they come to trust men.  The central plotline about Meg Ryan's and Mark Ruffalo's characters is really intriguing. she's very attracted to him, but doesn't trust him.  He's almost the perfect man -- handsome, confident, and extremely good in bed -- except oops, he might be a brutal serial killer of women.  Not unlike Harvey Keitel's character in ""The Piano"" (except Mark Ruffalo is indisputably hot) -- he's clearly the man who can save Holly Hunter's life and make her happy, but there's a lot to get through before she can accept that.  ""In the Cut"" is set in a pretty realistic, gritty version of NYC, and Frannie's dilemma is a logical extension of what it would be like to be single in a big city -- how would you know that you could really trust any man you might meet?The finale is a real nail-biter -- though you've figured out how it will probably end, and you know it will be really satisfying, the last ten minutes are pretty excruciating as you wait for those events to unfold.The only flaw I could find in this film is an excessive use of Dogme-styl e handheld camera work.  Meg Ryan does a fine job, Jennifer Jason Leigh is good as her half-sister (they have a very intimate, almost sexual relationship), and Kevin Bacon provides welcome comic relief as a creepy guy who can't stay away from Frannie.Ignore the critics and see this movie... particularly if you are a fan of Jane Campion's films, of Mark Ruffalo, or of films that explore the complex emotions and sexual desires of women.",In the Cut

She immediately feels this is an opportunity for her to put into practice all she has read about.Out of her usual environment she finds it dangerous but also feels the excitement of the moment.Quite cliché all. It is a simple detective story. The characters remain shallow. There is not depth in them and they do not evolve in any way.I thought Jane Campion would do a much better job. Alas, even she makes mistakes. What really annoyed me were all the references to ""To the Lighthouse"" by Virginia Woolf. All this quasi literism makes this film swanky.I rated this movie a 6.

There was nothing to him.I also usually like gritty mysteries. And as far as this mystery goes, I did not guess the identity of the real killer until the end of the movie. However, this was not the mark of clever plot twists. In fact,   after about 30 minutes, I couldn't have care less who did it. But I did appreciate the film maker's efforts to keep me awake by slapping me upside the head with a red herring every three minutes.Meg Ryan did a decent job in unfamiliar territory. But her character suffered under the movie world's delusion that ""real"" people all wear glasses and don't shampoo regularly. She also had absolutely no chemistry with Ruffalo.After the lights went up in the theatre, a woman in front of us turned to her friend and said, ""You don't get to pick out any more movies for awhile.""

This is my new worst movie of all time.  It used to be ""Pennies From Heaven"", but ""In the Cut"" reached new lows.   It worked at making me hate it.Meg Ryan plays a dowdy schoolteacher in middle of a boring pointless mystery. Jennifer Jason Leigh is her sister, a borderline stalker nutball. Kevin Bacon has a roll as an old flame/whack job that didn't really need to be in the film at all.  All the characters were flawed people living lives that were heaped with self doubt and depreciation with various clinical issues as well.While the characters could have been interesting if presented well, the movie doesn't make the effort. You get the vibe that Frannie is desperate for affection, but only a true crack whore would fall for the detective after the bar scene.  Yes, there is an emotional trauma that supposedly bonds her to him. But they didn't sell it and I aint buying.  It was impossible for me to get past this and it makes the rest of their scenes together contrived and ridiculous.The rest of the movie suffers from the aformentioned flaws, too numerous to list.  Suffice to say, I didn't care at all for any of the characters.  I was so bored by the end of the movie that the resolution to the mystery brought joy by the fact that I knew that movie ended.  Not a good way to spend your time.Yes, she gets naked. No, scenes were not erotic, rather painfully funny, due to the detective's rather pathetic attempt at dirty talk.

But it is shot full of mistakes.When the woman finally asks the Detective about the tattoo of the 3 and the spade he says he belongs to a club. She could have at least asked him how many members are in the club.Or asked him if he can tell her who is in the club. And then let him in on seeing the tattoo on the suspected killer. I don't think Malloy ever acts suspicious in any way. Too bad Nicole Kidman didn't agree to do this role. She would have been much better than Meg Ryan. Plus the sex scenes would have been incredible to watch.I see this movie as an example of main stream movies moving more and more toward including porn scenes. It has to happen. The merging of main stream movies and porn movies. Real characters having real sex or at least simulated sex. I guess movies like Eyes Wide Shut also fit this category.I guess I have seen too many movies. The plot of this one was obvious and the identity of the killer was not hard to guess or figure out.But I still liked it because I like Meg Ryan and I liked the acting of the guy who played Malloy.

Take the following as a fan letter to Meg Ryan: Ms. Ryan you should get a very bright medal for quite bravely scaling the verticals of your craft, and having a victory at the top of dangerous terrain. Jennifer Jason Leigh is also, as always, superb. In the end, what we take from this story, aside from the pleasures of nice direction, memorable atmosphere, and a good noir plot twist, is the sense that individuals enmeshed in tangles of almost unbearable indulgence and -- at least for the females in the tale, emotional starvation that almost always precedes this -- that such individuals can retain the dignity of effective participation in the panorama of the whole.

Although ridiculous, I've read some of the entertaining positive rave reviews herein by the few who hilariously justify entertainment such as this film; it's hogwash.Much like Washington is showing us, living the 'real' life primarily for our own self-centered prurient interest not only depresses one, it leaves you empty inside, and unable to fulfill the higher and many times more rewarding joy of producing works that lift people from the cesspool of this kind of hazy dark and lost type of life and form positive and meaningful relationships for you and those you love.If you want smut, buy a magazine and just climb back into your hole.",In the Cut

Some of the best moments in the film are of Meg Ryan's character, Frannie, on the subway. She reads passages from literature that are used as sort of PSA's for literacy. I was touched by the risk of showing that kind of moment to the audience. It's a moment likely to be overlooked or overly dwelled upon...hoping to find some clue to the mystery of ""who did it.""

In hindsight, I am glad that I did.The movie was a competent mystery, and that is saying something from me. It did keep me guessing most of the way through the movie.  Although the movie was somewhat hamfisted about throwing out the red herrings, it still left plenty of opportunity for guess work, and deductive reasoning.I also liked the fact that Meg Ryan finally did something with a little bite.  I am sick of all of the sickeningly sweet roles she has cast herself in for the last decade or so.  She is a good actress, and finally she has allowed herself out of her dependent relationship on the romantic comedy.
Campion's use of lighting and color was very distracting through the movie... almost to the point of annoyance.  However it did get a message across.  I am going to go back and watch this one again to try to glean more information from the cinematographic narrative that she put together.

Which all wouldn't be such a bad thing - it's just that there's not much else there to enable the viewer to relate to any character or situation. So, apart from some impressive city scenes, it's a rather depressing trudge through an uninspiring plot with more-or-less desperate characters.

Sorry to see Meg, Jennifer, and Kevin Bacon signed on for this.The problems are simple and easily fixed. First, when you set up a film, it's a make-believe world. That doesn't mean that the characters get to do whatever they want, though. They have to have some sort of behavioral logic to their actions. Jennifer Jason Leigh's character goes just a mite too far to be believable in that ""I know I'm a psycho stalker, but I can't help it"" schtick, Meg Ryan makes several illogical moves that make the viewer think, ""I know no one who would do that,"" and the Kevin Bacon thing just throws the whole movie for a loop for no apparent reason, as nothing seems to be resolved in that subplot.Meg Ryan paints a beautiful emotional landscape (which is often difficult for romantic comedy actresses to do) but sadly, the rest of the film and even her own character's actions fail to live up to this emotionally believable performance.3/10, partially for how many times we've seen this plot in movies before.

212,YesAlphaDiva,"Deep, lush, cruel...brilliant",10,29 September 2004,"My only regret is that I was originally influenced by the dismal reviews and did not see this film in the theatre. So many critics skewered Meg Ryan in particular for ""trying to reinvent her image"" with this complicated role that it became impossible for audiences to divorce themselves from the bad press. This is unfortunate because I for one had no idea that she was capable of such an outstanding performance. But that's only one of the surprises I experienced while watching IN THE CUT.This is not a conventional love story in the Hollywood sense, and I think a lot of folks who are seeking a more traditional and idealized romance will not be satisfied with the gritty nakedness of this film both literally and figuratively. There are scenes that had me absolutely riveted, aching with discomfort over the vulnerabilities displayed by the two lovers in the midst of their extreme circumstances, and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't placing myself in Frannie's shoes throughout the film. You have to be able to accept that Frannie's sense of deep passion is in direct juxtaposition with the danger she perceives. Once you've done that, the story vibrates with honest eroticism.Props to Mark Ruffalo as Detective Malloy -- he is, in a word, exquisite.Of all the romantic films in cinema from the past 10 or 15 years, there are four standouts in my collection that I would like to mention here. IN THE CUT is one of them. The others are similarly unconventional and equally outstanding: SECRETARY, THE PILLOW BOOK, & SEX, LIES AND VIDEOTAPE.

This is not your average whodunit, and the pronounced eroticism added some definite spice. It was an interesting piece for Nicole Kidman to choose for her first production, and Meg Ryan's lead character certainly went WAY against her usual type. The interplay between the two romantic leads was often abbreviated to heighten the sexual tension, but usually at the expense of driving the story forward. The whole experience for this viewer felt like it was veiled by three shots and a beer, leaving me off-balance but not unenjoyably so. It made the suspension of disbelief just a bit easier, a necessity for a movie so plot-thin and atmosphere rich.

Profanity in movies has never offended me, but the profanity in this movie just seems to be thrown in for its supposed shock value. This movie appears to be nothing more than a vehicle for Ryan to get naked and Ruffalo to talk like some prank-calling pervert at a payphone.  The plot was, well--absent.  The characters were despicable and repugnant and the atmosphere was grimy and foul, like a back alley crack house.  I had only one persistent emotion during this entire ordeal, and that was escape.

216,squirrelsatemynuts,Mediocre film; amazing sound design and nude scene,6,26 January 2005,"""In the Cut"" features solid acting and a nice color scheme but is mostly unremarkable in terms of story, script and visuals. Savvy viewers will recognize most of the plot elements and characters from other recent thrillers. The film does, however, have two remarkable elements: an amazing 5.1-channel sound mix and a nude scene that is notable not for its pornographic or fantasy-fulfilling qualities but for its stark realism.Anyone who appreciates film sound should watch (or rather, listen to) ""In the Cut"" because it's one of the few existing films that uses 5.1-channel sound for more than SFX gimmicks or making sure the Dolby Digital logo appears on its DVD case. The film creates real ambiance and mood with its sound mix, which helped suck me into the story world and get a sense of the characters' environment. I first noticed this when Frannie descends the stairs in the restaurant (just before she sees the mysterious villain). As she walks through the noisy crowd and down the stairwell, the conversations, bustling and other background fade from the front to rear channels and mix with her footsteps as she descends. This, to me, is much more elegant use of 5.1-channel surround than sticking a few whizzing noises in the rear channels when a spaceship flies off the top edge of the frame. ""In the Cut"" makes full use of its available channels, which is more than 99% of high-budget films can say.The other piece of the film that stuck with me was the nude scene with Frannie and Malloy that follows their inevitable hook-up. It's so rare to see a Hollywood nude scene that features characters just lounging with nothing on and in such an unromantic setting. It's especially amazing with an established star like Meg Ryan. There are no mysterious L-shaped sheets to hide their bodies but there is also no sense that Campion left them nude to attract voyeurs to her film. The characters don't assume erotic poses; they simply act as if they've already seen what they have to show each other, as most people do after sex. I don't often praise realism in films, especially stupid thrillers, but this scene stood out as much as the excellent sound design. If only the rest of the film could live up to those standards.",In the Cut

The one of an introverted but fully sexual woman. She is the opposite to her sister. The dialectic between both women is one of the lines in getting in the mood of the situation. Pleasure, love, confidence, is only possible if we get over the apparent differences. But, is it possible to get over them in relationships with men?. Men are stupid, violent, whether they're intelligent or not. Men could be luxurious or just brutal, but they're going all time over they're own desire, not attempting to look at women's desire. On the crime side, I've got to say that is a crude film. You've got to be prepared. But the plot works well. The rhythm of the movie goes slowly, like steps going up a stair.

219,xionga,"An honorable failure, worth repeated viewings",10,16 May 2005,"You've probably seen In the Cut once, noted the failure as an erotic thriller, were annoyed by inconsistencies in character, plot holes, Malloy's language. But this is Jane Campion, after all. You're probably female, or a smart, sensitive, sexually experienced man well past puberty. You know Campion must have been up to a greater artistic purpose.Well, rest assured. It's much better the second and third and  etc. time around. You don't care whodunit and Malloy never seems a danger to womanhood, so you can pay attention to all the interesting stuff woven through.Granted, Campion failed to a great extent--to show us something of women's sexual desires and how cautiously women have to maneuver in dangerous places in the world. (Alas, mopey old JJ Leigh continues to annoy as does the hoary male director's strip club crutch.) But it's an honorable failure.So--some of the stuff I liked ...... the swift shots of Frannie's feet, her shoes, Frannie wearing Pauline's (high-heeled) shoes. To be sexually attractive in the Western world, a woman has to wear uncomfortable clothes, hobble herself, make herself vulnerable ... and that includes to muggers and murderers. As Frannie listens to Pauline's sob story, she fingers her half-sister's high-heeled shoes, borrows a pair for her date, loses one while being mugged. The pair of sandals that she wears to enter (the dead) Pauline's aptthose aren't what she wears when she leaves. Malloy shows up at the police station and puts a missing sandal on her foot (Prince Charming!).Frannie's feet--no, her arch is one of her erotic zones. Malloy senses that very early on in the sex scene. She doesn't have to say much at all; he senses that she wants him to take her underwear off and so on. Then he kisses her arch.Hands are something else. When Frannie is interested or cares about somebody, she's checking out the hands. ...That little story Malloy tells about the first time he had sex with a woman (or a chick, the chicken woman--to reduce her). This is an aspect of something Campion keeps coming back to: men and women are constantly batting power back and forth: you can do this, you can't do that, I'll be vulnerable now, can I do this? Is this all right with you? If Malloy's story had concerned a 14-year-old-girl recalling being seduced by an adult man, it would be disgusting. But a 14-year-old boy is a whole different dynamic...The business with Frannie's bag and the little trolley. She doesn't want to let the cops to help her with it, to admit her weakness to them (ditto when Kevin Bacon calls while she is talking to Malloy for the first time). On the other hand, it's no problem with a student. That's what students are for! ... The scene when Frannie meets Malloy in the bar. He's picked up enough clues, so he cuts to the chase, chats her up using vulgar words. She's attracted, or at least intrigued. But then, the partner enters and uses similar language ... Yuck. Everything depends on context. Two men speaking that way in front of a woman, at least a woman they don't know well... I think any woman heads for the door. Campion shows this very economically.... The color red. Danger, vulnerability, victimhood, death. Glimpses of skimpy red dresses, a woman in a red dress running, the Red Turtle, red ""Mom"" wreath in the subway. Frannie doesn't notice much about the streets when she's looking from the windows of the cop carthen it's the running woman.... the background sounds, such as voices at the police station.... Oriental motifstai chi guy in the park in the very first scene, the hanging Chinese coins, Buddha image on the grubby bar wall, the Japanese poem, Pauline's key under a Buddha image in a flower pot, a woman with Asian features combing another woman's hair in the park (long hairanother symbol of danger) They're there for some purpose! ... What's the point of the cat? ... How often language links romance with violence. Malloy asks how Frannie's father got such a rapid response to his marriage proposal: ""What did he do? Romance her? Put a gun to her head?"" ... The camera-work and the editing. I think that Campion doesn't achieve this with blue filters, etc., though she uses a dull palette. She does this with very tight, shallow-focus shots. It's a very scrunched up, underground, underside view of New York. Does Frannie ever look at the horizon or glance up to see the facade of a building? See walls that don't have ugly graffiti? A street w/o trash? See any whole humans on the subway? Notice, as in the Red Turtle, that sometimes you just see torsos of people, not even their faces. Frannie's vision is very constricted. We don't know enough about her personal history, but perhaps she has good reason to have such a bleak, fearful view.... The Kevin Bacon character. Agreed: did he have to be that over the top? Yet I think most adult women are familiar with stalkers or women who have been stalked. Much more common than men believe. At the very least, what female hasn't had a persistent obscene phone caller? And often he knows your name.The sensitive male viewer thinks, ""Frannie must have been crazy herself to ever go out with someone as obviously nuts as kevinbacon."" But often, in real life, such men heretofore appear normal! Sometimes for years on end. It's only when women try to break up with them that they go psycho.... The pairshow much trouble they have sharing, communicating, co-existing. Frannie and Pauline, the outgoing risk-taker and the insulated introvert. Frannie and various. The pair of cops, a parody of a married couple. Malloy & wife. Partner & wife. Frannie's parents.",In the Cut

Her relationship with her nympho-sister and the sepia flashbacks to her mother's romance with her absent father lack emotional solidarity with the rest of the movie. I give this an A for effort and a C for affect, although Meg literally acts her tail off. Kevin Bacon is perfectly cast as the semi-crazy stalking med student who Meg once slept with. In the Cut may be a kind of anti-homage to Klute if one thinks about things too much. I'd rather flashback to that movie; one doesn't see as much of Jane Fonda as Meg.

Her subtle, nuanced performance is worth giving the movie your time, even if you don't normally like Ryan. Her under-the-surface sexuality is compelling, as is her attention to words -- the study she does of slang, along with her attention to the poetry of everyday language is juxtaposed against Malloy's more simple, direct language, and the startling, vibrant, and sexually- and power-charged urban communication or her students and others. If that is not enough, Mark Ruffalo is sexy, mysterious, and just fun to watch. Malloy's and Franny's chemistry is unmistakable -- palpable -- and beautifully filmed. Jennifer Jason Leigh, also gives a good performance - as the flaky and vulnerable sister.This film, along with much of Campion's work, can be viewed through a feminist lens. It certainly portrays sexuality and sensuality from a woman's perspective -- Campion has done expertly in _A Portrait of a Lady_ and _The Piano_. The question of whether or not Franny can or should trust Malloy and other men is a large part of the plot and subtext.The film keeps you guessing until the end about the motivation and trustworthiness of at least two of the characters, and that works well.

The direction was choppy and murky.  The dialogue was laughably awful.  With respect to the script, not only is the dialogue dreadful, the plot, such as it is, is abysmal, nonsensical.  There is no character development, although perhaps that is a good thing, as the little you learn of the characters renders them unsympathetic and dull.

I think it is slightly misleading that it is being sold as a murder thriller though, as that is definitely the subplot. It's really a beautifully shot piece about coming to terms with your particular sexuality. I thought the sex scenes were really well done and very sexy, yes they were a bit dirty with lots of naughty words and dialogue, but from my experience so is the best sex in real life.  And the Malloy character was dead dead sexy, yes he was blunt, but that's not necessarily a bad thing and he said some rotten things occasionally, but then so did she and so does everyone. I thought he was really honest and sweet.  I would have.The other important theme was the whole thing about the unreliability of memory, how we think we have seen things before and haven't, and how we can get very confused between what we expect to see and have actually seen. It has faults. The Kevin Bacon character, although well played, does seem rather tagged on, but then translating from a novel you often don't get the chance to properly portray all of the characters.

238,RatedAwesomeToAwful,Worst Movie Ever,1,13 February 2005,"Yes, I have seen some bad movies in my short 21 years. Being that I am a film student, I have seen several very boring, horrible artsy, documentary, or regular narrative films. However, I am declaring that this piece of worthless smut is the WORST MAINSTREAM FILM I HAVE EVER SEEN. I watch films constantly and I can't remember a time where I hated the characters on screen as much as the ones played by Meg Ryan and Mark Ruffalo as well as the others. The sh*t that Ruffalo says to Meg is beyond disgusting and incredibly unrealistic the way she mindlessly goes after him. Not to mention the ridiculousness of the ""plot"" and the twist. This movie is gross, disturbing, perverse, and horribly written and directed. I can't believe that this was written and directed by the woman who brought us the pretty good and artistically beautiful, The Piano.Anyways, seriously DON'T WATCH this movie. If you want to watch it just for Meg's tits, find a clip on the internet or something. It also needlessly has Ruffalo's nudity too. You've been warned and help me along with the other hundreds who rated this a 1 give it a lower rating than 5.",In the Cut

A touch dark for Meg, but a great movie! Lots of excellent performances all around. Meg is a great dramatic actress. She played on As The World Turns for a couple of years before getting her big break in Top Gun. She continuously gave an amazing performance in ATWT. She deserves meatier roles than what she became famous for. This and ""When a Man Loves a Woman"" are my two favorite movies of hers and they are both out-of-character dramatic roles. She succeeds admirably in both. Mark Ruffalo is great (and quite sexy), and Jennifer Jason Leigh is great as well. Not a movie for everyone, I admit, but for those that enjoy some dark and sexual ... this could definitely be for you.",In the Cut

This is an incredibly riveting story. The weak plot is just a convenient vehicle for exploring the vulnerable sexuality that we would all LIKE TO BELIEVE is underneath the surface of every sweet, perky, beautiful woman we ever met. Of course I have always been in love with Meg - who hasn't? - and now more than ever. She has truly added a new dimension to her long list of acting credits, and by the way the nude semi-explicit sex scenes turned me to jelly. If I can ever get over the memory of how her feet move while she masturbates, and how much she liked ""that thing you did to me"", my life might get back to normal again. Well, is Campion a feminist or not? Does she want us to try the cop's approach to a girl's heart - macho and crude - since that is what performs the miracle on Meg's usual character, the sweet innocent Frannie? And what is the deal when Frannie throws herself on the car hood and the cop just ignores her? He and Campion are the experts - so they are telling us that tormenting her will work also? Meg is perfect for this part - thank God it wasn't Nicole.",In the Cut
241,jeffpayne833,Ineffective in many aspects,3,1 January 2005,"I wasn't terribly excited about seeing this movie and would likely not have bothered if Mark Ruffalo were not starring. I've been impressed with his work recently, so I thought I'd give this one a try. It was a mistake. While Ruffalo did a reasonable job in his turn as the NYC homicide detective, a job that so many 30-something actors have taken, the rest of the movie was simply ineffective. I felt uncomfortable with the setting offered, which was certainly the intention; however the casting of Meg Ryan in the leading role was a blunder as she offers no insights into the character's state of mind during the film. I didn't know if Ryan's character was supposed to be mentally/emotionally disturbed or just simply unaffected by the crude environment she finds herself in.Both are entirely possible, yet Ryan did not lead us in either direction. Furthermore, the film lacked any real surprise or intrigue. While I'm struggling to find the words to articulate my feelings, suffice it to say that I was planted firmly in the back portion of my seat throughout this ""thriller"". I was never brought to any heightened state of tension, which I suspect was largely a consequence of Ryan's failure to make me care for the character.",In the Cut
242,bryan_jr2001,Just Terrible,1,27 January 2005,"I just want to say that this is one of the worst movies I have ever had the displeasure of wasting my time! The Direstor Jane Campion is an idiot for making a movie like this. I mean it just never really explains a whole lot in detail. Meg Ryan is naked half the time, and she plays this feeble, weak person who just wants to get screwed by whoever shows up at her door, in this case it's a belligerent New York cop who just isn't very appealing due to his blatant lack of disrespect most of the time. This genius thinks wooing a woman means talking about lots of hardcore sex while throwing in a lot of FU's. Then the director makes a brilliant move by casting Kevin Bacon as this CLEARLY INSANE GUY who never really gets ""over"" in the story. He just sorta hangs around, stalking her occasionally making no sense. And what was with the black guy trying to rape Meg Ryan, yet another part of the storyline that went NOWHERE!! We sit through all of this crap just to find out (surprise, surprise) that the Detective's friend is the killer...and THAT MY FRIENDS is one of the most disappointing parts of the movie!! The climax is that this so-called cop is the killer. We DON'T EVEN GET TO SEE HOW MEG RYAN KILLS HIM. The next thing you know she's struggling with the guy, clearly he's a lot stronger than her, he's got her hand with the gun pinned to the wall, and in the next scene the guy is MIRACLESSLY DEAD after somehow Meg Ryan frees herself, but of course you don't get to see that and Meg Ryan goes back home to the romantic FU cop. Movie over. Gee that was great!! Don't waste your time...Please!!",In the Cut
243,lucy-locket,Brilliant Disturbing Thriller,9,19 June 2005,"I must concur with Richard Mason's comments it is a great film, much better than the over rated Piano. Meg Ryan has never been better, I guess some viewers were disturbed not to see her in her usual perky blonde persona. But believe me this is a far more interesting Ryan than that of French Kiss, Sleepless in Seattle etc. Frannie's structured life is disturbed when the body of a young woman is find near her apartment building and the police find she was at the bar where the girl was last seen alive. Frannie is such an unconventional heroine. She does not spend her life waiting for Mr Right, she does not dress to impress, her main concern with clothes appears to be function. Her passion in life is collecting words and it is this passion that leads her into the path of the cops and the killer. I would definitely rate this as Campion's best, closely followed by Holy Smoke and Portrait of A Lady. The mark of a great film is that it gets better on each viewing, In the Cut does that and much more.",In the Cut
244,bradley_dial,Awful,1,3 March 2008,"*** Possible Spoilers ***Sorry, but anyone who thinks this film was well written or too nuanced for the typical moviegoer's palate is fooling themselves. This movie is overflowing with style at the expense of substance. The cinematography was annoying. The entire film played like a dream sequence or the point of view of a drunk. Either way, it detracted from the film. You can have atmosphere and striking images without having half of every frame out of focus. It looked as if the entire film was shot through a large format, view camera with the standards racked at impossible angles. It was annoying. Someone mentioned the sound. Sorry, but that was over done as well. The entire film sounded as if was set in wind-chime shop with the doors open to gale force winds. Too many insignificant sounds were picked up, while the sounds of New York City seemed to take a back seat. The story was ridiculous. I'm not saying that it needed to be a lesson in police procedures, but they could have at least pretended there were some. Apparently, so many murders go unsolved because homicide detectives are busy cleaning up other people's food and drink, delivering other detectives food and drink or playing guitar. That, and nosing around someone's apartment, while she is there, without any relation to the task at hand. Detectives ask questions about pertinent information, not pictures and poetry tacked to the wall. Likewise, detectives do not wander in and out of crime scenes whilst having private conversations and engaging in phone sex. When making a film, it's important to create characters and situations that are plausible so that the audience can suspend disbelief long enough to become engaged by your characters. The situations involving the detectives in this film did just the opposite. Furthermore, high school teachers do not meet students in bars, unless they are actively seeking prosecution and termination. Someone said she was a college professor, but I've never heard a school bell ring on a college campus, and the students that I saw were high school aged. The characters, on the whole, were utterly unbelievable. And don't try to tell me that I don't understand it because my pool of friends and acquaintances is too shallow. No one, save for some sort of sociopath would make the choices Frannie makes in this film. Malloy treats her like crap and seems to go out of his way to frighten her, yet she is attracted to him? Sure, there are plenty of women getting slapped around or demeaned and degraded by abusive men, but these are almost exclusively limited to long term relationships. Malloy acts like a creep. He clearly creeps her out when he's in her apartment and does so, even more, when they are in the bar. She recognizes the tattoo almost immediately, and is clearly creeped out by it as well. Yet, she still gravitates toward him. Her character is consistent only in being inconsistent. I would have a much easier time believing Pauline's character would fall for a guy like this. Cornelius was simply a caricature of a young, black man. I felt like the screenwriter simply watched a few silly teen dramadies and thought ""Ooh...that must be what they act like"". Kevin Bacon's character, while well acted, was another caricature who seemed there only to throw the audience off. And again, when he has broken into Frannie's apartment, she acts in a manner that is wholly inconsistent with any semblance of normal human behavior. This is, without a doubt one of the poorest films I have ever seen.",In the Cut

As long as she stays drunk and has sex we've got a film eh guys? Who's with me? *Crickets* Seriously the plot line was dumpster juice, Meg's just gotta have sex scenes about every 5 minutes where she's masturbating then eventually boning the angry confused detective because that's what you do when you're investigating a murder, sleep with a potential suspect. Ruffalo's character, not believable. What a hot piece trash the whole dialogue was. Terrible directing choices with such great actors. Kevin Bacon was hilariously terrible, he was going for a manic depressed schizo with tourettes syndrome, forced and not believable. More like a failed SNL skit. Seriously he tried... and failed miserably. They really gave the serial killer to the dopey Italian cro magnon guy. I mean even though it was meant to lead you astray the whole context was a disappointment. They could have cut so many scenes to make this tolerable. They did not. A pointless scene about firing a gun in the park with Meg and Mark. Why? Why are we doing this? Dog sh*t. So her best friend gets killed and she's hugging a plastic bag of her friends head while she's balling. I'm sorry but What the f*ck is going on here? Nobody even bothers to question her at all?

The sex scenes mirror real desire and are vaguely reminiscent of those in ""The Piano"". In this film Campion put a magnifying glass on lust and it took fire. I have played these scenes over and over, cant get enough of them. There is a magnetism in Ruffalos dark eyes, and a resonating quality to his voice that just begs you to play it again. The only other scenes that have weakened my knees such are the famous Mr Darcy/Miss Bennett scenes in the BBCs Pride and Prejudice. No comparison otherwise.This is a must for those lusting realism in the screen bedroom. Not a bad plot, either, but desire is the thing in this film.",In the Cut

Short and sweet but not so to show ambiguity towards the writer as it is only one person's opinion, as this here be only my opinion, but I think, yes indeed Jane Campion is a brilliant, seemingly well-rounded director. In particular Campion's direction towards a brilliant performance done by Mark Ruffalo. To accredit both Campion and Ruffalo on this feat, is not only to see the deeper side to Campion's work, but to understand her plight as a healer and a teacher opposed to just being a commodity in our consumerist society.It is obvious that you have seen more than one of Campion's films and so therefore I must assume that you know a little more about her work than just the picture on the screen, although it doesn't seem like it. In the Cut, a token thriller, yes. I think to focus on this aspect of the film misses a very important point completely - Campion is a superior auteur of film-making, where in this story the love connection is obviously the important part and the thriller aspect the vehicle. Did you miss a beat? I think your blatant disregard to her work, in its entirety is one of a person without an ounce of insight, maybe it is you, who should look at the deeper character within yourself.",In the Cut

The commentary track helped clarify some points - but, that shouldn't be necessary.The camera work is brilliant at times, some the hand-held during dialog was quite natural. Only once, during a mid shot, did an odd non-uniform focus pull my attention away from the story.The music is sumptuous but too much in the foreground; I shouldn't be thinking about the music, ever! At least, not during the love scenes. On a second viewing, I found the music lacking in punching up the action. This movie could have been a lot more thrilling with a modern day Bernard Herman. Now, who would that be? The 5.1 presentation of ""production sound"" (not dubbed) is phenomenal! It sounded like real life.Most of the writing is natural. Two parts that pulled me out were the silly drawing on the blackboard and the walk home - both were unbelievable.The editing was understated and effective.The real reason for watching this film is Meg Ryan's performance. That girl can act! I wouldn't have believed it after seeing her miscast in ""Proof of Life"". In that film, her character seemed shallow; in this one, she was deep  coming across as both dowdy and sensual at the same time.

For us who watched it for other reasons it was definitely a romance/mystery novel turned movie and that was very obvious from the first scene.Although some parts seemed unnecessary the storyline was great. I loved the thriller mixed with romance mixed with mystery.

252,milkwoodforest,The Complexities of this film Only Appreciated by the Complex Themselves,10,14 February 2007,"I was shown In the Cut by a friend who had bought it for his small collection and I was spellbound. Years later I've found out that it has only been understood by few. I can still watch it after 10 times and be mystified by the depth, brilliance and intensity of everything about this movie. To me, the serial killer theme was just that, a theme to further intensify the desire and obsession that Meg's character feels towards her cop lover. The exquisite use of colour and angles and focusing on seemingly mundane things and actions is beautiful. The thought taken to show a womens burgeoning obsession, her submission and therefore a perfect compliment to mark ruffalo's character. Her seeking out danger in the grips of her own excesses of emotion. Her desperation to be encompassed by her lover. Perhaps this can only be felt by those who have felt it themselves. And then the parallel of the psychopath who cannot feel, mimicking human emotions when he preys on his victims, wanting them to act out a courtship, as he mimics everything, everyday. In the initial sex scene, Frannie expects that Malloy is going to covert her callously and she prepares herself for sex, but he surprises her in his unexpected tenderness. Their chemistry is palpable. He is complex, she mistrusts him but is drawn to the danger of him as she is drawn into the danger of everything that is happening around her. Her ability to throw off her cutesy romantic comedy role and become plain, flawed and obsessive is remarkable. Her obvious pain and rejection when she walks away from the bar that Malloy and his partner are drinking at, feeling that she is a not a part of their dynamic, was real and unforced; the way she waited in the rain in case he may run out and look for her and then walking home at night and manifesting a mugger....which gives her the chance to call Malloy, a sexual/submissive fantasy realised. In all, I find it tragic that the complexities and brilliance of this film have been overlooked, but isn't that true for all the greatest art.

253,mpgpapers,Found it quite interesting,8,26 April 2007,"I wouldn't say that I loved it since the history has a few weak moments. Some of the dialog's, for instance, do not help very much to make the story. However, the director got to create an environment quite threatening and harsh, in a way that makes easy to connect with the sense of danger and enclosure of the main character, who also happens to be a poet. But what really made 'In the cut' so interesting to me was the fact that it is courageous and unusual to make a thriller out of the erotic fantasy of a woman. Men's erotic fantasies are commonly portrayed in action and mystery movies and everybody seems to find it OK. That is not the case, though, when behind a screenplay plenty of sex and violence you can clearly see a feminine stance. As a woman I can say: this movie is both very sexy and deeply disturbing.

Admittedly there could have been a lot less of it.I wasn't expecting much given that i though i was sitting down to watch ""against the ropes"" on the TV. The sexual nature almost made me turn the TV off but the performances from both Ryan and Ruffalo are so engaging. Given a chance the story is also something you can easily get into. By the end of it I loved it.Actors are constantly slammed for not going out there comfort zone, yet here is someone so far out of her ""cumfy"" zone its like an alternate universe. Handeling it so well, she deserves so much more praise than she ever got.I've never seen another Campion movie but this was handled well and i may look into some more of her work but only if its story out weighs the explicit content.Watch it, only if you are willing to see Ryan do something against type.

And it really never recovers, story-long you cant shake the feeling that your watching actors on-screen, which is a point, the actors feel quite hollow , with the possible exception of ryan, who sometimes under the heavy strain of the excrement that this film is that bears on her, manages to act half-decently, other than that, the films actors are lifeless shells, slaves to the poorly written script and poor direction. i wish i could say better of them, but cant. Lets get on to the main selling point of the movie- the sex content, which admittedly drew me to the film. There's just one thing to say about it, it just doesn't belong. The rest of the movie could go on quite easily without it, a murder ""who-dun-it"" that keeps you guessing, (truly this is the stong point of the film) that is hampered so heavily by this forced sexual content. The love element was completely destroyed by this, and so any attempt for the film to now revert back to a conventional film relationship is void, therefore when the film does try this, it turns completely laughable. This is a great shame, as i thought ryan could possibly do well in that situation, but nevertheless, it was'nt to be. thankfully the artsy feel of the opening credits dies down (or is forgotten) and so isn't to be feared movie-long, thats about the best positive I can end on. thanks for reading.",In the Cut

Then we are dealing with sex, sex and more sex. Not even good sex. I think imaginative, sensual scenes play out much better than rather graphic sexual situations. Does Meg Ryan being nude add anything to the film? Meg has done so much better and has stooped to absolute new lows with this. You have a plot that goes nowhere, picture quality that is out of focus, badly acted and stupid stuff happening (like a cop playing a guitar in the squad room)and the conclusion that flopped, all in all a horrible 2 hour experience that I would not wish on my worst enemy.

With my enthusiasm in hand, I proceeded to drag my better half and my housemate out for a meal and a movie.Well, after it all, at least the meal was pretty good.I'll break 'In The Cut' down into its base elements, and you can make up your own mind if you want to read any further. 1: Meg Ryans breasts. They get a lot of completely pointless screen time. 2: Masturbation. 3: Neurotic characters. All of them, seriously. 4: A plot that attempts to simulate depth by using vague referances and sexual deviancy.That's about it.The blurb informed me that the movie revolved around a terrible serial killer, and the turmoil involved in finding him. From where I was sitting it appeared to revolve a little more around loose women and bad dialogue. I could be wrong about the loose women though, with the quality of the camera work they very well could have been men.I am not too familiar with the directors previous work, and after sitting through this garbage I'm really not keen to look into it any further.The movie attempts to give us some insight into a group of terribly traumatised minds, all of them obviously quite desperate for some human contact, but falls over itself by giving very little in the way of background to support these characters. I couldn't give two s**ts about any of the people I was seeing on screen. I didn't want to know any more about them, and I didn't want to see another person touching up Meg Ryan. That got old after the first seventeen overly dramatised and completely inappropriate sexual interludes.The cinematic equal of prison rape, except I actually had to pay for the privelige.That about sums it up people. If you only completely avoid seeing one movie this year, make it this one.Completely woeful. I want that two hours of my life back.",In the Cut

267,Catanya9,One of the best films I've seen this year,10,30 December 2004,"I saw this film with very low expectations after reading several reviews. I have to say, I disagree with all of them. Meg Ryan's performance was great, even more so from someone who is usually type cast into romantic comedies. She is captivating and completely believable - the same for Mark Ruffalo. I always had mild, Luke-warm feelings about him, but he really did an amazing job with this part. The dialogue in particular could have made his character come off somewhat as a caricature, but he made Malloy come alive with all his brashness and confusion. And to the previous reviewer who referred to the sex as depraved and perverted, which movie were you watching? And yes, there was some nudity in this film, but most of it was not Meg Ryan. All in all, an excellent film, highlighting some of the less conventional relationships we have.",In the Cut
268,ricardo-barbas,Awful,2,18 January 2004,"Well...i fell asleep in the theater...i guess that sums pretty well the low quality of the film. Or maybe it was that i've seen the day before a stunning movie (Habla con ella-Almodovar), but this movie plain sucks. There are are no redeeming parts about it. And the part were the killer is revealed is plain silly. It could be him just like it could be the cleaning lady. What was the purpose anyway? The characters are very shallow and the actors performances are just bad. Avoid this movie",In the Cut
269,seaofjade,I still love her even if...,4,12 February 2004,"even if... (with the exception of the sexual chemistry) I had to force myself to make it to the end.  Although I am somewhat of a Meg Ryan guru, I waited until this one came out in the video store as I had already heard the negative reviews from friends. I don't always trust the critics, but in this case, the critics were right also!  The plot is predictable from the word go.  There is absolutely no mystery or thrill (as in thriller) to this film, and this could be overlooked, if indeed there was any amount of substance to the characters or the story in general.  If Champion's goal was to make the character of Frannie abstract and elusive, she succeeded, to the point of boring. And what was the point of trying to make Ryan look mousey.  For an actress over 40, she is anything but.  Oh yes, abstract and elusive. And for God's sake what was up with the ex-boyfriend (one of Beacon's less flattering roles and very poor acting) and even worse, the scene with the student in the apartment?  What was that all about?  This could have been a good movie if two things were different.  ALMOST EVERYTHING. Ok... moving on, I will not critique without saying something positive.  With regards to the sexual chemistry, I loved it!  I thought Ryan and Ruffalo (Malloy) pulled off the raw, animalistic, ""shut up and *love* me"" (love for a better word) kind of chemistry the roles called for.  Comparing to that dark side in Nine 1/2 Weeks and Unfaithful. Ryan reveals her diversity as an actress (and a beautiful body if that was her's), and I am pleased that Mark Ruffalo was chosen for this role.  He has a ruff, harsh, somewhat sexy exterior and I believe that is what was intended.  Although this movie will most certainly not be up for an Oscar, (but then again...) I though Ryan and Ruffalo acted accordingly (to whatever it was Champion was thinking).",In the Cut
270,mcasey-1,Freaked me out,7,17 February 2004,"Her movies are unique... not for everyone. They're not your ""typical"" thrillers. But this one was quite realistic... The characters were a bit odd, but odd people do exist! I was sucked in to the film from the moment it started. The suspense was great (not overwhelming, and not typical) and it left me feeling very freaked out... I locked every possible thing in my apartment before going to bed!",In the Cut
271,msandi-1,Meg Ryan finally shows her stuff,8,26 December 2004,"For years I could not stand most of the roles Meg Ryan would portray, especially those like ""You've Got Mail"" and ""Sleepless in Seattle"".Even her fake orgasm in ""When Harry met Sally"" really did seem fake - just another young person out for the shock factor.I was sick of her goody two shoes roles. Finally she has shown us she can act! She portrays a realistic person in a real world situation. As seedy and undesirable as the movie may seem, Meg comes across as a real person and not some kind of fairy tale figure. There isn't one time she smiles with that goofy turned up corners smile she has either.I hope to see more of Meg now that she has proved herself. I'm so glad she redeemed herself.",In the Cut

But I can't imagine what possessed them to participate in such a waste of time.  Based on the script alone, they should have run.  I'm not a prude, and don't mind rough language or sex in movies, but only when they add something to the plot.  This movie showed how to put excessive sex and vulgarity on film without accomplishing anything.  Meanwhile, I think the photography and music were supposed to somehow create a haunting backdrop for the characters.  It just succeeded in being mildly unsettling.  My advice: everyone involved wasted their talent on this one, don't waste your time or money.",In the Cut
274,taschmalvogl,"Intense, Suspenseful",8,13 March 2004,"The gritty cinematography and internalized character that Ryan plays make for a surreal trip.You never know at any time who the real killer might be; the true test of a great thriller.Jane Campion successfully pulls us into a world both charmed and frightening- the characters are simultaneously passionate, guarded, and potentially dangerous... ultimately, they're all quite ""lost"" in some way or another, and seeking desperately to find some sort of peace- all of them go to fascinating extremes in order to try and attain what they think they need in order to be satisfied.",In the Cut
275,rcunningham-4,"Intriguing, sensual unexpected Jane Campion turn.",8,7 May 2004,"Not usually a fan of Meg Ryan, but had heard good things about the book. Mark Ruffalo is EXELLENT in this--very different from previous roles. The character is mysterious and unpredictable.I liked the jumpiness of the camera in the movie--it created a tone of awkardness and unpredictability, even in non-action scenes. It gave you an idea about what it feels like to live in a city, and as a neurotice city-dweller at that. Kevin Bacon pops up as a nutty ex-boyfriend--he seems to be best in small character roles (like JFK).The ending is prolonged once you see what is coming (and you will)but film is an intriguing journey. Not sure I needed to hear Meg Ryan whisper the lines of subway poetry in about 4 scenes or what that was supposed to make me feel or think.",In the Cut

It doesn't have to be a happy or uplifting story, but it should leave me with something other than a bad taste in my mouth. If this movie was an attempt by Meg Ryan to lose her clean cut sweet image, then it succeeded, but that's the only thing positive I can say about this sordid mess. There was not one likable or believable character in the whole cast. (OK, maybe Kevin Bacon's dog. ) Ms. Ryan's, Mr. Ruffalo's , and Jennifer Jason Leigh's characters were all totally disagreeable lowlifes masquerading as; a college professor, one of New York's finest, and a totally disagreeable lowlife (at least one of them got it right.). It was sad to see this waste of fine acting talent. There wasn't any suspense or plot worth the effort either. Much of the story was a not too subtle collection of red herrings aimed at making the viewer suspect one character of the grisly crimes but they were so obvious that I discounted them from the get-go. If that character had indeed been the killer, that would have been a surprise and would have earned this a higher rating. I saw this movie FREE on cable. Still had the urge to ask for a refund. Time is money and this was a total waste of time.",In the Cut
277,mvsen,Multiple layers of story telling.(mild spoiler),10,21 September 2004,"To appreciate any of Jane Campion's films one must be willingto dig beneath the surface. Despite her commentary, regarding thedrawing of the lighthouse, on the DVD (special features) where shestates that she doesn't want people to look for symbolism, herfilms are, in fact, so packed with symbolism that I find it hard toignore - and, for me, the symbolism is an integral part of myenjoyment of her work. She is most definitely the heir apparent toBernardo Bertollucci, and like him she seems to deny theconscious inclusion of the hidden meaning. Well, conscious ornot, it is there.As in ""The Piano"" and what I refer to as ""The Piano 2""(Otherwise known as ""Portrait of a Lady"") Little Red Riding Hoodseems to be traipsing merrily towards the fulfillment ofher'symbolic death/rebirth - although not as overtly as in theprevious two. Still, a poem she reads in the subway about 'losingthe path after entering the dark forest', does tip one off, even if themultitude of red cloaks, coats, dresses, interspersed throughoutthe film, do not.Ms. Campion also frequently uses the visual symbolism ofupward or downward movement to explain her intentions. Heavenor hell, conscious or unconscious, we instinctively know whichdirection is which. Early in the film, in a crucial scene, shedescends into the basement of the bar, (or into her ownsubconscious) where she stands beside the coat rack with -guess what - a red coat hanging on it, and secretly witnesses heralter ego, Ms. Riding Hood symbolically complimenting the BigBad Wolf on the size of his ... well, you get what I mean.Of course Red Riding Hood is not the only myth which JaneCampion employs. We see haunting shadows of Greek, Christianand - you name it, ( Hindu? Nordic? ) mythologies. She also - in anod to Mr. Bertollucci, I think - uses dualities in a dreamlike,almost Freudian way. Each personality is represented by at leasttwo characters. Or sometimes one character can represent twopersonalities. (The Wolf and the Woodsman are the same personin this version.)This is, in conclusion, a perfect film for home viewing. Use thatpause button, and use it often. Question everything that you see.Every picture on the wall behind the 'action'. Every hand or bodyposition. Every object or person sticking 'accidentally' into thepicture who doesn't really seem to belong. If you didn't 'get' thisfilm, or any of Ms. Campion's, watch them again.

Meg Ryan is truly a wonderful actress. I encourage anyone who hasn't seen In The Cut to do so whenever they get a chance. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. Some of the things that happened I just couldn't grasp right away...The movie just left me wondering who could really be the killer?...It will totally fool ya. Kevin Bacon is yet another very good actor. Although he has a small role in the movie, he still stands out so much. Detective Malloy, played by the Ruffio guy did an excellent job as well. The only one I wasn't too sure about was the student...You've just got to see the movie to pick up what I'm puttin down I suppose. If you're looking for a suspenseful movie...this is so it!!!",In the Cut
279,dirge75-1,Weak thriller. Great examination of trust issues.,8,5 October 2005,"This underrated movie isn't really a thriller. It's a romance -- albeit an unconventional one.The story's about a timid woman with major trust issues (Meg Ryan as Frannie) who becomes romantically involved with a rough-talking homicide detective (Mark Ruffalo as Malloy) after she becomes a witness in one of his murder cases.Frannie's a single woman living in a harsh, threatening urban environment, which she seems to observe from a distance even while she's living in it. She doesn't seem to have any friends, except for her half-sister (Jennifer Jason-Leigh) whom she's very close to. She doesn't trust men, and she especially doesn't trust Malloy, even suspecting him of being the murderer himself.Yet the relationship -- which is mostly based on sex -- seems to take over her life.The romance seems to fly in the face of every Hollywood convention. The sex isn't romanticised. The male lead isn't well-groomed, muscle-bound and charming. And yet, that makes it all the more seductive somehow.Jane Campion doesn't seem interested in playing up the thriller angle, and yes, the thriller parts feel a little tacked on. The thriller mostly serves to set the mood, as if it were a metaphor for the emotional dangers of a new relationship. In the end, the movie proves itself to be primarily about the relationship between Frannie and Malloy. Well acted and beautifully shot, this movie is worth seeing.",In the Cut

The world that only exists in dreams. The kind of ideal love that never comes.I really liked the movie. And Meg Ryan was just gorgeous!",In the Cut
281,junk-276,Terrible,1,7 May 2005,"I saw this movie last night on HBO and I was really surprised by how terrible it is. I think it's clear that the director was trying very hard to achieve something stylistically unusual, and create a great film. The result, however, is a completely unsatisfying mess of bad acting and a disorganized, unrealistic plot. Watching the film is much like trying to hold a conversation with someone who has severe ADD. The plot continually goes down little tangents, and seems to systematically leave them all unresolved. A fairly generic and uninteresting murder mystery is underlying. When the truth is finally revealed in what is supposed to be a shocking climax, I still found myself not caring. This is one of those movies that makes you feel that two hours of your life has just been taken away. Avoid this one.",In the Cut
282,m-stoor,I love this movie.,10,2 January 2005,"Without sharing any plot element whatsoever, ""In the Cut"" is as feminist as the 1977 Italian film ""Wifemistress."" Meg Ryan's character is allowed to be smart and independent as well as pretty and sexual. If you think that's common in films, think again. ""In the Cut"" has haunted me since I first saw it, and has compelled me to watch it again. This mystery combines the despair, seediness, dark shadows, grainy shots, erotic allure, and hidden motivations of film noir and pulp fiction, with a fluid surreal quality beyond the genre. The audience is not told whom to trust. The characters have very little dialogue, and reveal very little insight about themselves of their own accord. I was surprised to find myself captivated by this device, instead of thinking there should be more character development. Call it a guilty pleasure if you must. I love this movie.",In the Cut
283,northcreek,Watch it: A good film,7,3 January 2005,"I'm surprised at all the negative stuff I've read here about this movie(maybe it's just this venue, which I'm new to). I checked and the highest ratings were given by older women such as myself! And I noticed that the men were the ones that either didn't get it or thought it offensive (although some young women thought the Meg Ryan character was too dumb!) I suspect there's something to all this, though I'm not sure what. Thrillers should be brainless? Smart movies shouldn't involve sex and violence? I think that's what you might call irony, and that both Susanna Moore and Jane Campion are smart enough to get it, and give it as well.What this movie says is that love, sex, trust and such are complicated, non-PC, and totally unrealistic in the end. No, it's not a ""realistic"" movie. Have you seen a cop show or movie that is? It'd be pretty boring. But falling in love with someone who's apparently both kind and bad, smart and stupid, and so on, is.It's beautiful, complicated, a little flawed but mostly good movie. I'd watch it again, and I don't say that often. The story, the film-making, the acting...I can't find fault with any. I was completely taken by it even though I knew the ending (it's a darn good book, too!).",In the Cut
284,Gemma67,No Waiting in Vain for a Brutal Romance,8,5 January 2005,"In The Cut displays the underbelly of the New York its denizens can recognize. It shows the beauty that anonymity can offer. I've known Frannies. Maybe glimpsed her in my own mirror once or twice. To survive, Frances Avery has isolated herself in settling for safe place within her mind and passion for words. Make no mistake; it is a shocking film as was the brilliant ""The Piano."" The murders are brutal, the imagery disturbing. Its graininess resembles a very bad dream with characters that haunt you after awakening. Even the negative reviews will attest to that. The killings are actually the background of a realistic, surprising relationship between a man and a woman. No pretty film artifice for Frannie or Malloy. There is realism to them that it isn't often seen on screen especially in the intense, erotic sexual scenes.Mark Ruffulo and Meg Ryan are excellent in the lead roles. Watch this one more than once so the shock can ebb and allow clarity. One wonders what the cover of the Post would have been ""the morning after"" of the film's ending. No doubt anonymity gave way to the infamous 15 minutes of Mr. Warhol's prediction.",In the Cut
285,david-1666,Oh dear!,4,7 January 2005,"Have you noticed how occasionally a film critic will put down a certain movie; but you decide to watch it all the same and surprise, surprise a perfectly enjoyable although not memorable film! At this point you are no doubt expecting me to tell you ""In The Cut"" is just such a movie! Forget it; the critic was absolutely on the money. I don't know who is the worse, the writer for dreaming up such an unentertaining plot lacking believability, and injected with a perverted view of reality. The producers for actually going ahead and backing the project! Or me for wasting what must have been 2 hours (though it seemed much longer) of my life! If its ""unique selling point"" is to shock through the use of gratuitous sex mixed in with more bad language than anyone would use. Then it's a winner, but if the idea of producing such a movie is that we are to find it shocking but yet compelling it sucks big style! I can't help get the feeling that the writer must be an extremely well connected teenage male virgin to of manufactured this crap and then been able to have it made into a movie! To later find it was written by a woman certainly surprised me. She needs to get a better grip on reality and live amongst working class people if she is to write about them. The over use of bad language demonstrates her remoteness and lends an air of patronisation.Perhaps I show my lack of breeding and education level in not finding the poetry link to the plot (there is one, isn't there?). I kept looking but by the end still couldn't figure that out! The producer's must have been so blown away by Meg Ryan's faked orgasm in ""When Harry Met Sally"" for casting her in the role of heroine. Unfortunately it seems Meg Ryan must be enduring hard times to have taken this role and her lack of enthusiasm shows. Not so Kevin Bacon who is only in for about 3 minutes to act as a red herring. Yes it's nothing but a cheap ploy to star Meg Ryan and Kevin Bacon to get some credibility for his project but Mr Bacon's brief but wild appearances grab attention and you expect his reappearance towards the end of the film to save the day. The unfortunate thing about the movie is the heroine's fascination with a darker side of sexuality starts off well with a promise that the voyeuristic scene is totally necessary to the film, by the end however it became clear the level of detail was gratuitous. This was also true of the murder scenes. They had impact that would have worked well had the plot the ability to carry and use them. Unfortunately due its short comings they simply became gratuitous as well. On a positive note Mark Ruffalo carried his role well although it must have taken a lot of motivation to choke down the rubbish he was handed to work with. Further this film must be very heartening for upcoming writers. If Susanna Moore can turn such garbage into a best seller then there must be hope for the rest of us to be able to pen something decent!",In the Cut

I have always been a fan of hers, and this was a BIG set back. She has done such outstanding work, I hope this was just a ""pause"" and not a new pathway.She is such a beautiful woman, and in this film, it was hard to even see her lovely self. I didn't know the other actors in the movie. I am not a prudish person so it was not the content of the movie that bothered me.

I could not suspend my disbelief enough to accept that Ryan's character would be in any way attracted to Ruffalo's. It didn't ring true on any level.But finally-- (and here's why it gets three brownie points)--an American film where the characters don't pull up the sheets to hide their bodies after they've had sex.

Movies are in 99% made in the view of a mans eye, so when it comes to sex and feelings they are based on a mans fantasies -therefore I am not touched by these movies. More of films like this!

There is nothing to take away from this movie except the fact that both Meg Ryan and Mark Ruffalo really needed the paycheck. The erotic storyline is about as sexy as your grandmother in bike shorts and the rest of the movie is filmed in the worst partial focus and color gels I have ever seen. The only thing that I am thankful for about this movie is that I got it from my local library and it did not cost me a cent, but I really wish I could get my 118 minutes back.

The story is of a serial killer in the streets of New York who seeks delight in the savagery of the killing and the reward is of the blood of the young women. The storyline could have the typical murder/detective movie that is often seen and then forgotten! Jane Campion is able to turn this very dark and at times gruesome plot to a story of relationships that all have Ryan's Frannie at the core...I was surprised at the selection of actors in the roles as this takes them out of the normal roles and for the main actors I did feel they floundered a little but for the most part performed beyond my expectations and did it so well. I think the guidance of Campion encouraging them to take things to a level the most seasoned of actors would have hesitated showed in the freedom they displayed in the roles. This a well presented sexy and intense movie where the murders are secondary to the emotional and physical relationship between Ryan,s Frannie and Ruffalo's Malloy.",In the Cut

And the fact that Ryan was played down in this character strengthens her creditability! The twist was fresh but not too blinding and the ending was exactly what was hoped for, I'm glad Malloy was still in the room in cuffs and not having had miraculously unhinged himself from cuffs to save the day. Some have stated that this movie was just down right disgusting and vile, I have one thing to tell those people and that is that art is an expression of differences and images that won't hook everyone but to leave enough residue on the brain to show things from another perspective other than their own. The passion in this movie was beautiful, it's so refreshing to see a dominant REAL man again!!! Where the hell did they all go??? Mark's portrayal of a harsh yet sexy-dark hard-guy was on the key, the only other actor I could have imagined suceeding this role as well would probably be Bernicio Del-Toro. The fact Mark bared all was truelly amazing, it's not like he's Vin Disel but a REAL human being MAN who showed justice in this movie. I Loved how Frannie played timid with her initial sex scene with Malloy, I think we've seen enough nypmhs on the big screen to last a life time.

What attracted Ruffalo's character to Ryans character, goodness only knows and vice versa. Perhaps all very true to life but how dreary they all were and not interesting enough to hold ones attention for long.

I had the sense that the director was trying to bring me into Frannie's world through visual tricks, but they seemed forced. It was apparent early on the color red was going to play an important part in the end of the film, because almost every scene had some red peppered through it, but it was done is such an obvious way that it became distracting. And every time I saw the red hat or the red shoes or the red newspaper box, I was struck that it seemed so dated - I remembered how effective a trick it had been with the movie 'The Sixth Sense' and how long ago was that? I found nothing sympathetic about the main characters. And while I didn't expect Frannie or Malloy to have a heart of gold I would have preferred to care about whether or not she gets killed in the end. As it goes, I didn't. Casting baby-faced Ruffalo as a tough-guy, sex-starved cop seemed a confusing choice. I love Ruffalo, even in his darker films, but throwing a Village People mustache on a guy does not necessarily make him appear more menacing.And I know this will make me seem like a prude, but I did have a problem with the first sex scene, where Frannie comes upon a couple in a sex act. There is a close up view of a portion of a penis on screen for several seconds. I don't have a problem with the act itself, but I do wonder why it was necessary to show the penis. It was fully apparent that the guy was getting a blow job, I'm not sure what cinematically was gained by showing that level of detail. I can only think that it was put in to push the boundaries of the rating system, or to fulfill some strange agenda. It seemed pointless and arbitrary. Well, I guess that is in keeping with the rest of the film.",In the Cut
296,sbeth-2,comment on In The Cut(2003),8,24 March 2006,"Settling, for the fourth time, to the off key elisions to the song and piano rendition of Que Sera Sera, by Hillmarson as the entrée into In The Cut (2003), I couldn't resist contemplating a line of continuity between female characters, Ada (1993), Isabel (1996), and Franny (2003). Ada migrated to the other side of the world to an arranged 19th Century marriage in The Piano (1993). Isabel elected a marriage within 18th century European upper class mores in Portrait of a Lady (1996). Professor Frances Avery walks out with the type of resolves that independent women make to explore and sustain a sense of empowerment in a contemporary urban world. The need to face up to and act upon personal fears is a character prerequisites. Such are the dominant themes in this film. It also addresses issues about abandonment and intimacy.In The Cut (2003). is a penetrating achievement set in central cinematic territory. ( noir/drama/action/Thriller). Avery, (Ryan), lives near a 'red light district' in a 'singles world' of women and men married and single, sets of people with desires, rationality, responsibility, disappointments, explosive personalities and yearnings. During lingered moments at an early phase of the film, the cameo bond of the two Avery sisters is memorable. They are born to two different dads. Franny has lived abroad, gained her PhD and teaches writing. Younger sis, Pauline (Jason Leigh) is laconic and a mess. She 'confesses to accosting her current GP, 'stalking' him with frank abandon. Another support character, an 'out of work' actor, John Graham (Bacon), is seen psychologically ""unravelling"". These two portrayals foreshadow the steps toward risk that Franny shall soon take. Pauline gives a courtship charm bracelet to Franny when she hears that she has a 'date'. The sentimental token signs one of three shaken grounds in male/female relations. Franny teaches Virginia Wolfe's, To The Lighthouse, to an English literature class and is researching street slang. The writing is ""witty"", she establishes."" All streets slang is either sexual or violent"". As does Ada, Franny has passion and 'free will' - inspired by life's poetic intensity. The film has all the features of cinema classicism. Set in a hot damp summer in New York city, these characters inhabit a sexually loaded world. Hillmarson's score deepens to cue us to a dark zone. Bebbe's cinematography is choreographed with telephoto intensity. He uses such fine depth of field and subtle subjectivity. The light falls in washes of day or near twilight orange - soon plunging to blue green and black. We know from back history, (The DVD), that Campion has made an adaptation of Susanna Moore's novel, In The Cut (1996). Moore wanted to,""try something new"". She is the screenwriter. She read every detective and crime fiction she could find, for two years, and she read a lot of pornography and a lot of erotica"".Campion has often pointed out her thrill at having been exposed to the ""great"" films of the 1970's this presumably including Chabrol as much as Fellini, Godard or Cassavettes. In these films characters often just exist in film time - not always having to talk or do. As for the architecture of classic mise-en- scene, this set is dressed with dedication. Brownstones dominate. Street cameos include doorways, the urban dirt, the corner pimp, the shadows, the back light and the detritus of junk food containers at the local precinct. The lens tightly selected focal plane, taking the precinct as example, is a tour d' force of atmosphere with each film space discretely sonorous.Cornelius Webb (Pugh) is Franny's one writing class student given context He is an ""affective pupil"". He plays an important scene in anger when Franny, experiencing grief and loss has clouded clarity. When the story begins, slogans on the underground advertisement racks introduce Franny's research and give us an easy opportunity to have interest in the central male character, Detective Giovanni Molloy (Ruffalo). Homicide detective and English teacher are fresh subjects for a convincing ""love affair"". The film's ideas are topical. In one scene, Molloy points out that Franny's ""over thinking"" makes for an ""exhausting relationship"". He teaches her to handle a firearm. As to crossing over any boundaries, Franny moves to fetish. This proceeds, in swift order, to dramatic tension and ultimate release in the denouement. The story's scope allows this character to explore fear and self with a quiet, brave, and, surely, exhilarating degree of risk. Ryan goes on record (DVD) as coming to a Campion film with a determination, perhaps not too much differently than Hunter to The Piano. The way that art reflects life and life art is a compelling adjunct to the integrity of the drama. Women hunger for women roles in which to figure.Ruffalo delivers a performance that never wavers in human attentiveness or social manners. He is an unreserved character, indicating availability, compassion and commitment. He also brings a ""kind of brokenness"" to his character, which contains real nuance. The positioning of yearnings for love on thin ice and the close portrayals of intimacy, confusion and desire, are made quietly credible in this film. The actual crime milieu works as a graphic context, and if seen this way, the end result is cinema of adult quality quite distinct from a perceived television competition in this genre. Ryan quotes the book,"" One of the requirements of a human being is to render to the evolution of the soul. To this end, ever since Sweetie (1989), we are reminded of Campion's passion for humanity. We see Giovanni gain respite and Franny gets her chance to grow.( Note.It is no surprise that Bebbe went on to shoot Collateral(2004),Memoirs of a Geisha (2005)then the Florida Maimi Vice (2006) series).",In the Cut
