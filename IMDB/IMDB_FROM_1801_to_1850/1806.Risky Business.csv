0,bkoganbing,"She's In Product, He's In Sales",7,11 November 2008,"Risky Business and All The Right Moves are the two films that launched Tom Cruise's career as brat pack film star. Unlike so many of his contemporaries from the Eighties, he's proved to have staying power and will no doubt continue to do so. All The Right Moves established Cruise as a dramatic actor, but Risky Business is a fun comedy about a hormone driven teenager who when the folks go away from his Chicago suburban home and he's left to play, he gets himself in all kinds of problems. First dialing up call girl, Rebecca DeMornay and then not having enough coin of the realm to pay her. Then getting mom's treasured glass egg stolen. And then getting the family car driven into Lake Michigan.But Cruise and DeMornay, who is having trouble with her pimp Joe Pantoliano, hit on the brilliant idea that there's a market out there for his group of eager overachievers. And Tom's house becomes quite the swinging brothel.Risky Business turns out to be pretty funny business. Best scene in the film involves Tom with Princeton interviewer Richard Mazur. You've got to love the way this boy gets into the Ivy League. Second best scene involves Tom and the family car as it plunges into the lake and then gets hoisted out.Tom's definitely proved to have staying power in show business. I can see his character in Risky Business growing up to be Jerry Maguire.",Risky Business
1,SnoopyStyle,"a pinch of The Graduate, a dash of Ferris Beuller, and a whole lot of Tom Cruise",8,8 June 2014,"Joel Goodsen (Tom Cruise) is a horny suburban Chicago teenager who is always concerned about his future. His folks are going out of town, and Miles (Curtis Armstrong) tells him to say ""What the F***"". His parents don't understand and they set up an interview with Princeton. He is part of the Future Enterprisers with Barry (Bronson Pinchot) but doesn't necessarily like it. Miles calls up a transvestite for Joel and he-she offers him Lana (Rebecca De Mornay). It's a memorable night but in the morning she wants her $300. She takes off with the crystal egg and he has to get it back. When he finds Lana in the city, they go on the run from his pimp Guido (Joe Pantoliano). Lana won't leave when Guido shows up. When the Porsche goes into the drink, he needs money to fix the car. He ends up in business with Lana, but Guido just won't let her go.This is a classic coming of age movie. Of course there is the classic and often referenced Tom Cruise sliding around in his underwear. However this is more than that in this movie. Joel is reminiscent of Ben Braddock from 'The Graduate'. He wonders if the plans that his parents have for him is right and he asks if all everybody wants is money. ""Doesn't anyone want to accomplish anything or do we just want to make money?"" Yet he doesn't run away from the money. He just doesn't have a clue about his future. There are the great dream sequences, memorable lines, and the general originality. Who could forget about the Porsche? The performances are terrific and the most vexing question of all is what ever happened to writer/director Paul Brickman. His limited success after this is the most disappointing thing in this movie.",Risky Business
2,Hitchcoc,Something Sad About This,7,3 December 2018,"First of all, I feel this was far fetched. Tom Cruise came along and made a name for himself (remember That Old Time Rock and Roll). HIs entrepreneurship and lack of direction, and pressure from his family,lead to some choices that could be deemed somewhat ridiculous. I know it's just a movie, but I don't see him the least bit heroic (and I generally like Tom Cruise). The conclusion is formula and that detracts from its effectiveness.",Risky Business
3,Prismark10,Misadventures of a rich kid student,4,29 July 2013,"Risky Business was a big hit in the USA and gave Tom Cruise a leg up to become a big star.Cruise carries the lead role well especially with the dance sequence to Bob Seger and very much has the 80s vibe.However there were too many rich college kids films made in that era, you know the ones that lived in a mansion, whose family had three cars and there was a Porsche or Mercedes in the household. Heaven forbid if you made a film about poor, working class students.Cruise plays a rather uptight, wide eyed innocent who becomes embroiled with a prostitute played by Rebecca De Mornay and becomes embroiled in a crashed Porsche, her pimp played with a mixture of menace and humour by Joe Pantoliano and a call girl racket in his parent's house.It is actually rather tame now but for a few risqué scenes usually set to music but it's ever so slowly paced and yet it reminds one of a time when filmmaker's felt that your average rich kid student was worth making a film about time and time again.",Risky Business
4,gavin6942,The Early 1980s Fantasy,7,1 December 2015,"A Chicago teenager (Thomas Mapother) is looking for fun at home while his parents are away, but the situation quickly gets out of hand.Looking back now (2015), the 1980s are seen as the decade of greed and unrestrained capitalism. This may not be accurate, but it is the caricature. How interesting that this film arrived so early in the decade, promoting ""business"" and capitalism through the view of prostitution and pimping. There must be a social message here, but I am not sure what.What really stands out is how ""clean"" it all is. The pimp is a bad guy, but never really dangerous. Prostitutes are shown as fun-loving, rather than strung out on drugs or with other issues. And even the main character sees dating a prostitute as a great thing, ignoring the reality of disease and the fact his girlfriend is sleeping with his friends for money. So strange!",Risky Business
5,lee_eisenberg,Here's what was risky.,7,15 January 2006,"Everyone remembers the scene of Joel Goodsen (Tom Cruise) dancing around to ""Old Time Rock 'N' Roll"", but some people may have forgotten some of the movie's other aspects. The plot of course has Goodsen hooking up with prostitute Lana (Rebecca DeMornay), but the movie also shows the takeover by greed in the '80s: Joel's classmates are obsessed with money, and he even asks if people can think about anything else. Oh well. I really liked the scene where people are arriving in the house while ""Mannish Boy"" is playing (the movie was actually released the year that Muddy Waters died). And it's also surprising now that I know who some of the cast members were: Joe Pantoliano - of ""The Goonies"", ""The Matrix"" and ""Memento"" fame - plays Guido the pimp, and Curtis Armstrong - aka Booger in ""Revenge of the Nerds"" - plays Miles. Whoa.",Risky Business
6,jboothmillard,Risky Business,7,19 September 2008,"I saw the most memorable single scene on this film borrowed for an episode of South Park, and I had a vague idea of the film's premise, so I thought I might as well try it. Basically Joel Goodson (Golden Globe nominated Tom Cruise) has the (suburban Chicago) house to himself, because his parents (Nicholas Pryor and Janet Carroll) are going on vacation, as well as a Porsche. One night his friend Miles (Curtis Armstrong) contacts a call girl named ""Jackie"", and it turns out it's a transvestite (Jurassic Park III's Bruce A. Young), but he does give Joel a contact number for a female call girl, Lana (Rebecca De Mornay). After spending one night with Joel, she asks for $300, she agrees to wait for him to get it, but when he gets back, she's gone, along with his mother's expensive expensive Steuben glass egg. Joel does find her again, and she agrees to give the egg back, as long as she can stay with him, and get away from pimp Guido (Joe Pantoliano). Originally Joel rejected the idea of inviting many of his friends over the house to pay for sex with Lana and many of her fellow call girls, but when his Porsche rolls into Lake Michigan, and getting a short suspension from school, he and Lana arrange a large party, the house becomes a brothel for a night. At that night, he forgot a Princeton interviewer, Rutherford (Richard Masur) was coming over to evaluate him, and quite a few interruptions occur. The evening was a success, but Joel wakes up to find everything in his house (furniture, ornaments, appliances) are gone, and he has to buy it all back from Guido before his parents get home. In the end, the only trouble Joel got into was with his mother and that glass egg (it has a crack), and he was accepted into Princeton, and Lana wants to keep seeing him. Also starring Bronson Pinchot as Barry, Shera Danese as Vicki and Raphael Sbarge as Glenn. This is a good comedy film, with some unusual scenes, and of course, the most memorable scene is when celebrates having the house to himself when he dances to Bob Seger's ""Old Time Rock and Roll"" (the scene South Park borrowed), which was number 100 on 100 Years, 100 Songs. It was number 51 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments for Joel's first night with Lana. Very good!",Risky Business
7,Woodyanders,Not your usual lowbrow 80's teen sex comedy,9,26 March 2010,"Sweet and naive straight-arrow 17-year-old suburban high school student Joel Goodsen (a highly charming and spot-on performance by Tom Cruise) gets left alone to take care of a posh house after his parents are away on vacation. Joel meets and becomes smitten with shrewd call girl Lana (splendly played with sexy and saucy aplomb by Rebecca De Mornay), who turns Joel's previously bland and orderly world completely topsy turvy. Lana convinces Joel to turn his home into a brothel for one night in order to make a bundle. Writer/director Paul Brickman takes the hackneyed premise of your standard adolescent coming-of-age tale and totally turns it on its ear by eschewing the expected raunchy horny teenager hi-jinks in favor of a wickedly witty and astute satire on the blithely amoral money-grubbing capitalism and shallow materialism of the 80's. In addition, Brickman brings a hip and arresting elegant style to the picture that's positively breathtaking to behold (the glossy gliding cinematography by Bruce Surtees and Reynaldo Villalobos is simply sumptuous). Moreover, along with the cool neon aesthetic there's a dark and surprising element of stark and slightly scary danger and disaster lurking just around the corner; it's this bold extra ingredient that gives the movie a freshness and originality that's enabled it to hold up remarkably well over the years. Cruise and De Mornay do stand-out work in the leads; they receive bang-up support from Joe Pantoliano as menacing pimp Guido, Curtis Armstrong as the brash, scruffy Miles, Bronson Pinchot as the nerdy Barry, Richard Masur as stuffy Princeton college interviewer Bill Rutherford, and Nicholas Pryor and Janet Carroll as Joel's domineering parents. Tangerine Dream's hypnotic score further enhances the film's substantial mesmerizing buzz. Why, we even get a few moments of genuine eroticism (Lana's memorable introduction in particular is smoking hot). Highly recommended.",Risky Business
8,rmax304823,"Enterprise, But Not Free.",6,19 August 2012,"Tom Cruise is Joel Goodsen, promising young son of a well-to-do family in the Chicago suburbs. He's doing the best he can at high school in order to be admitted to Princeton, where he'll major in business administration. He hires Rebecca De Mornay, a call girl, for one night while his parents are away on vacation, and De Mornay teaches him what business is all about.Cruise isn't bad as the naive school kid, and De Mornay has got her role pinned down as the smooth young hooker. The morning after Cruise's night of ecstasy, calling himself Ralph, she fixes his breakfast and tells him the night will cost him three hundred dollars. Cruise is astounded. ""You're kidding,"" he says. ""Gee, Ralph, I don't believe I am,"" she replies coolly, sauntering past him.She sends him off to the bank to cash a bond and, while he's gone, steals his mothers expensive glass artifact worth much more. Cruise is now terrified. He manages somewhere around here to dump his father's Porsche into Lake Michigan and now owes the dealer an enormous amount of money to restore it. (""Who's the U-boat commander?"", the dealer asks him.) But, following an argument with her pimp, Joe Pantoliano, she returns to the suburban house with a hooker. Together they figure out a scheme to make more than enough money to pay off Cruise's mounting debts. The two girls simply invite a dozen of their friends over and turn the mansion into a whorehouse for one night. It works, too. Cruise is admitted to Princeton, has a final fling with De Mornay, and the only sin he's stuck with is a tiny crack inside his mother's expensive glass egg.It's not a masterpiece and it resembles just another teen-in-trouble movie, yet it's enjoyable to watch it once. I particularly appreciated the director's deliberate style. No flashy special effects; no instantaneous cutting; no basilar-membrane-dissolving electronic percussion music. The style suits the material. You need time to absorb the amusing moments because they're not all thrust down your throat.Joe Pantoliano is superb as the pimp. He plays it entirely straight as the frustrated but far from evil manager. De Mornay and her friends slink around and are as warm and perceptive as their experience allows. In life, people in De Mornay's profession tend to have the emotional depth of hard-boiled nurses.During the night the orgy is taking place, there is a visit by a scout from Princeton, who looks around, gets an impression of what's up, scans Cruise's academic record, and tells Cruise, ""Nice stats, but it's not really Ivy League material, is it?"" Cruise's response is comic. He slaps the scout on the knee and says, ""Sometimes you have to just say, 'What the f***.'"" And later he tells his friends with a goofy grin, ""It looks like University of ILLINOIS."" That was a little condescending. A lot of dopes graduate from Princeton and Harvard, although the schools are hard to get into, unless you have an enormous amount of money. If he wanted a demanding education, he should have looked into the University of Chicago. And De Mornay's confession that the first night with Cruise meant a great deal to her seemed like pandering. At least they didn't wind up in love with one another, just another ""Pretty Woman,"" with the rich kid and the whore falling for each other after some comic incidents in fancy hotels and restaurants.Those are minor criticisms though, and I'm not sure everyone would recognize them as weaknesses. As a whole, it's a likable and sometimes funny divertimento.",Risky Business
9,Tweekums,Great early film from Tom Cruise,9,11 December 2010,"I enjoyed this film when I first saw it back in the eighties but feared it would have not aged well; when I watched it again I realised I need not have worried as it was as entertaining as ever. Tom Cruise is Joel, a high school student whose parents are going away for a few days; he doesn't have any plans but his friend Miles does he orders a prostitute called Jackie for Joel! When Jackie turns up Joel is understandably flustered and makes his excuses, Jackie leaves but not before giving him the number for Lana, apparently she is 'what all the white boys want'. Later that evening Joel make a phone call that will change his life; Lana comes over and after giving Joel the night of his life asks for three hundred dollars for her services, money Joel does not have. He goes to the bank to get it but when he returns Lana has gone along with one of his mother's valuable ornaments. He sets out to get it back but when he finds Lana she is having problems with her manager/pimp they drive off and she treats him to another night, this time for no charge he still hasn't got the ornament back and things go from bad to worse when an accident leaves his father's car in Lake Michigan. Luckily Lana has a great idea to pay for the repairs and make a lot more money besides she will introduce her friends to Joel's friends for a fee.This film surprisingly didn't feel very dated; if it wasn't for the fact that nobody used mobile phones or the internet it could have been set in the present day. Tom Cruise did a great job as Joel in the early role, Rebecca De Mornay did really well as Lana, coming across as smart, sexy and somewhat less than trustworthy and Joe Pantoliano was suitably slimy as 'Guido the Pimp'. Given the subject matter it isn't surprising that there are a few sex scenes, while they are fairly short and not very graphic they manage to be quite steamy. There is a small amount of nudity but it is almost a case of blink and you miss it. Normally I don't really notice a film's background music but here the score by Tangerine Dream is fantastic, fitting each scene perfectly. I'd certainly recommend this to fans of eighties high school films as it is up there with the best of them.",Risky Business
10,blanche-2,A young man's life goes from bad to worse in '80s film.,7,18 October 2005,"For a kid who has nightmares about making mistakes and not getting into college, Tom Cruise sure gets into a lot of trouble in ""Risky Business,"" one of his star-making films. Cruise, then just 21, still with his original nose and chin, appears with a lot of other youngsters who went onto careers with varying degrees of success: Rebecca DeMornay, Curtis Armstrong, Bronson Pinchot, Shera Danese, Megan Mullaley and others. Cruise plays Joel Goodsen, who is basically just that until his parents take a trip. Joel's troubles begin when his friend phones a call girl for him over his objections. She's not his type, but she knows who is, and passes him the phone number of one Lana (DeMornay). Besides ripping him off, Lana becomes like the man who came to dinner. Before Joel knows it, he has an unhappy relationship with her pimp, rolled his father's $40,000 car into Lake Michigan (in a hilarious scene) and is flunking subjects. Desperate for money to get the car fixed, he and Lana go into partnership, and Joel suggests to his friends that they could use some sex ed before college. In the midst of his hook-up party, an ivy league college admissions officer (Richard Masur) shows up for an interview.This is a very funny film that includes the oft-imitated ""Old Time Rock 'n' Roll"" sequence and pays homage in its way to the end of the age of innocence and the beginning of American greed in the '80s.There's a hot sex scene on a train and lots of good music, plus a good performance by Cruise and the rest of the cast. No matter how you feel about Tom Cruise, you have to give him credit: he's managed to stay on top for 30 years.",Risky Business
11,Quinoa1984,a smart bunch of WTF,9,5 July 2016,"It may be difficult for some, and for the younger ones the context is not there, but do you remember when Tom Cruise really gave a full PERFORMANCE? By this I mean in a movie where he had to play at a full range of emotions and explore a character who has to face real obstacles and has an arc that takes him on a journey from one place in his life to another - in this case the ""coming of age"" story, perhaps some pun intended- but one that didn't require him to run away from explosions or kill people (I won't say he doesn't run at all in this movie, though here it's for things like making sure he's not late to school)? This is one of them, the one that made him a star, and it's clear to see why as we see him as Joel start out in a rather simple position - a teenager with girls on his mind (or, more accurately, sex) but with some neuroses and doubts - and through some decisions involving the idea of ""hey, f*** it"" gets in way over his head.Risky Business is the kind of film that might not be able to get made today; imagine a studio exec hearing a pitch that involved a teenager getting a call girl, let alone setting up basically a (brief) brothel out of his house, to pay off some very bad luck moments and decisions he gets in to with the Rebecca Demornay character (and Joe Pantoliano, what a great heel he gets to play the hell out of! every moment's a delight that he's on screen). It probably would be laughed off, or told it wouldn't make much money. I'm glad someone took a chance on it at the time, since it holds up today. For the most part. As long as you meet it halfway, which isn't too hard. Indeed Brickman's tone as a filmmaker is to make things feel rather serious and grounded in the style so that when their is humor, and there's a lot, it comes out of awkward tension and behavior.It has a constantly fascinating mix of comedy and drama not unlike The Graduate. No, it's not in that league, but Brickman swings for the fences as far as depicting as honestly as he can under the circumstances he sets up for himself (which are a little just pre-John Hughes world, it IS Illinois by the way so the milieu is somewhat the same). You feel the struggle that Joel has, and hope that he can get out of his predicament, though at the same time he keeps getting into more precarious waters. It's relatable, especially if anyone ever got into just a little trouble as a younger person, which I assume are most of you. It's simply that Risky Business takes things further and further along.And it's sexy. Boy is it a sexy looking, sounding (Tangerine Dream's score is wonderful), and acted and performed. But it also finds the humor in sex too, how absurd it is to suddenly see about a dozen beautiful women come through a door, one by one. So if you want to see a studio dramedy that takes chances with an early Tom Cruise performance where he's acting his ass off, this is one. You have to suspend your disbelief, such as for how things like money transactions with prostitutes actually work and how it seems like ALL of the male high schoolers and ALL the attractive call girls just happen to be around and willing to go for it over one night), but as the film plays you really don't question things too much and can go with the fun and real *stakes* that this very R-rated story has.It's comical, thrilling, and it takes genuinely surprising turns that come naturally from plants and payoffs in the story. Risky Business is not at all what I expected, which was just some goofy and dopey teen comedy (the iconic, yes, iconic, shot of Tom Cruise in the underwear doing the first lip-sync battle with no one to Bob Seger was all I really knew about it), and what I got is a movie for adults that happens to have teenagers as the main characters.",Risky Business
12,edwagreen,**1/2,6,15 August 2015,"Unbelievable film with the admission's officer at Princeton actually being influenced by what he sees when he pays a visit to the home of the student wanting to enroll there. He tells him that his actions are not exactly Ivy League, but at the end, he is admitted. Obviously, this is totally unrealistic.Tom Cruise plays Joel from suburban Chicago, obsessed with college entrance, only to be introduced to another form of life on a dare from a friend, which leads him to utter mayhem and near ruin while his parents are away for a week or so.Rebecca De Mornay is effective as the wayward girl who finds love with Cruise, while she teaches him the rules of the sexual game and how to benefit from it financially.",Risky Business
13,BandSAboutMovies,Made Cruise a star,6,7 December 2019,"Written and directed by Paul Brickman, this movie dominated 1983, making a young Tom Cruise - dancing in his underwear, no less - into a legit star.Beyond the Tangerine Dream score, the movie boasts a major scene scored by Phil Collins' ""In the Air Tonight"" as well as the aforementioned Bob Segar ""Old Time Rock and Roll"" tighty whitey dancing number. Plus, it has ""Hungry Heart"" by Bruce Springsteen, ""Every Breath You Take"" by The Police, some Journey, Jeff Beck, Prince, Talking Heads and Muddy Waters, too.Cruise is Joel Goodson, a high schooler dealing with the expectations of perfection and attending Princeton. The teen movie trope of the parents away for the weekend and the parties that ensue are part of it, but so is a very real narrative of what growing up means. Rebecca De Mornay shines here as Lana, again another trope of the hooker with the heart of gold, yet outdoing the expectations that you have for how her story progresses.Between this film and The Blues Brothers, Ray-Ban's Wayfarer sunglasses found themselves going from waning sales to being the hottest shades ever. That popularity has really never ceased.As for Tangerine Dream, most of their score for the film comes from their album Force Majeure, including the title song from that release making up Lana's theme. They also based another song, ""No Future (Get off the Babysitter),"" on a past song called ""Exit.""",Risky Business

It established him one of the most famous movie star in film history.The film was about the misadventures of Joel Goodman,a suburban Chicago teenager who suddenly cuts loose.When his parents leave on vacation and leaves him the responsibility of taking care of the house.When he decided to use his father's Porsche and got it into an accident,he sudden need for cash makes him use the house for some unauthorized business which involves a pimp and a group of call girls.The acting was excellent for the cast. Special mention should be given to Joe Pantoliano,Rebecca DeMornay and Tom Cruise,who became a superstar in this film.The direction of Paul Brickman was superb.The movie also had its great moments one of which becomes a classic representation of the 1980's when Joel Goodman sang ""Old Time Rock N' Roll"" in his underwear.Overall,this movie can be classified as one of the best during the 1980's.",Risky Business

At times it's funny {very much so}, and yet it's also at times a tad bonkers, sexual therapy and capitalist fortitude's come crashing together to make a quite an intriguing coupling. Opening with a steamy dream that our boy {soon to be man} Joel is having, this lays the foundation for the whole point of the film, it is the key to the core of Risky Business' satirical seriousness, as far as 80s films go, Risky Business is very much on the money.But that is the problem in going back to the film now, its impact has long since vanished, the only thing remaining would seem to be Tom Cruise's grin {here on overdrive with great exuberance}. Does any newcomers to the film care to analyse its heart beat?, many now i feel just simply expect a teen sex comedy played purely for laughs, and with that in mind Risky Business doesn't come up to scratch with any other genre piece outside of the 80s, but for it's time it surely was one of the key films from that particular decade, you just gotta wanna have the urge to see it is all. At the least one should see it for the beauty that is Rebecca De Mornay {Lana}, and to catch Joe Pantoliano having fun as a mad dog pimp, oh and then there is Tom Cruise, a star was born, and then some.7/10",Risky Business
17,Scarecrow-88,Risky Business,10,11 January 2011,"RISKY BUSINESS was the first film to communicate the meaning of sex to me. I snuck a viewing of it fairly young, too young to fully understand the traps and pleasures sex could bring to someone inexperienced, yet inquisitive and vulnerable enough(as teenagers often are). Tom Cruise was the epitome of cool to me as a kid. I wanted to have that presence, that look, to wear Ray bans and carry myself with that kind of confidence. I wanted to have that kind of charisma, star wattage, to appear on screen and smile with all the charm to melt the hearts of practically any girl. The film itself, rises beyond just Cruise's star power, his young man really has a lot of pressure put on him. He wants so desperately to appease his wealthy parents who ""trust him"" but demand much out of him. He's given the ""keys to the castle"" so to speak, the parents leaving him all alone while they go on a momentary vacation at his aunt's. The Tangerine Dream score equates the already striking allure of the film's subject matter. Rebecca DeMornay was a vision of the perfect fantasy ""danger girl"", a sultry, seductive prostitute who enters into Cruise's life and turns it upside down and inside out. He is just a boy before meeting her and after their ""two days"" together, he becomes a man. I think many will consider the results of the various crises which accompany his time with DeMornay rather preposterous or unrealistic, the way he somehow manages to escape certain doom(maybe this is a bit over the top, if anything his parents would've grounded him or punished him in some unsevere way). But from the perspective of a teenager, to let your parents down through nefarious behavior would be the ultimate horror..we build these terrifying scenarios of what they will do to us, but it's never as awful as we would be led to believe. Anyway, getting involved with a prostitute and finding yourself caught between her and a pimp, Cruise finds himself knee-deep in a situation he shouldn't have been in to start with. It really starts with a phone call, not being able to pay the girl after she provides you with great service, a stolen diamond egg that belongs to Cruise's mother, becoming a for-one-night-only pimp, accidentally sinking your dad's porche in the river, missing an important test, allowing your Princeton representative to see your nightly activity as a ""businessman"", and losing all of your parents' personal belongings and furniture because you took girls away from Guido(an excellent Joe Pantoliano, rather intimidating despite his size and receding hairline). It's casting that makes this film purr--DeMornay as quite the sex kitten, Masur as Rutherford, the man who can make or break Cruise(he is a friend of Cruise's father and agrees to meet with the young man over going to Princeton), Bronson Pinchot and Curtis Armstrong as Cruise's buds(Pinchot is Cruise's partner in a business project for class and Armstrong is the one who gets Cruise in the whole mess by calling a transvestite hooker from a sex ad), and Nicholas Pryor and Janet Carroll as Cruise's suburban parents who expect much from their son regarding his future. The ""love on the train"" scene still smokes and the first sex scene between Cruise and DeMornay is really steamy(they just have that chemistry because both are beautiful people). It's that aspect about this woman who represents everything a teenage boy of 18 considers attractive and hard to resist, she looks at you with her eyes and moves across a room with little effort and it's instant and immediate awe. It's a tightrope you are willing to walk across because she casts her wicked spell and there's no turning back--you are hooked, line and sinker. DeMornay was the epitome of what I desired and longed for as a teenager..perhaps she wasn't the one you'd marry or have a long term relationship with, but she is the woman you can't get off your mind, staring at the ceiling imagining what it'd be like to grope every part of her body, ever so slowly.",Risky Business
18,Doylenf,"The era of good, wholesome fun was definitely over...",5,13 April 2007,"It's sad to think that RISKY BUSINESS is the film that turned TOM CRUISE into a household name almost overnight--and simply because everyone under 35 who went to see it recognized their own fantasies being played out by a guy who was the antithesis of Andy Hardy.Well, almost everybody. Not everyone fantasizes about having his parents go away for the week-end so he can hire hookers to spice up his rather inexperienced sex life--and yet, that's the premise that put this film over the top at the box-office.While TOM CRUISE and REBECCA DeMORNAY do respectable enough jobs in their unbelievable roles, it's just a teen sex comedy with one thing on its mind and it gets pretty tiresome after the first thirty minutes have gone by with everyone concentrating on either sex or money.True, it's probably a pretty accurate portrait of how trashy American culture has gotten over the years and how youth is wasted on the very young--but the storytelling is never judgmental no matter how boorish the behavior is and there's no lesson in this for anyone to absorb. ""Get away with it if you can"", seems to be the moral philosophy of the screenplay. In short, it doesn't say a lot about suburban America's middle class cultural values.Not only does it present teen behavior in the worst possible way, but the blissfully ignorant parenting leaves much to be desired. In fact, the most unbelievable aspect of the story is the way the trusting parents react upon their return.Summing up: Pretty dismal comedy no matter how you look at it.",Risky Business
19,view_and_review,Horny Boys with Money,6,11 August 2019,"Wait a minute, Rebecca De Mornay was a sex object before The Hand that Rocks the Cradle? My lasting image of her is none other than the evil antagonist in The Hand that Rocks the Cradle.Joel Goodsen (Tom Cruise) is a normal high schooler with normal stresses: grades, girls, and getting into college. In this case Joel is stressed about trying to get into Princeton. During this stressful time in his life his parents take a mini vacation leaving him home alone. What is a hormonal teen to do with a week alone in a big house with a Porsche in the garage? I wasn't thinking call a prostitute but that's what he did.Lana (Rebecca De Mornay) is about the same age as Joel except her life is going in a radically different direction. She was the call girl that showed up at Joel's front door. A series of events led to them being in a different type of business arrangement that was lucrative for the both of them.This movie was a little comedy, a little drama, and a little suspense.

Joel is initially against such an idea, at least until the Porsche accidentally falls into Lake Michigan, requiring a quick infusion of ready cash......With such an illustrious career, probably one of the biggest successes in Hollywoods history, it's clear that Cruise is not just a bona-fide movie star, the man is a living legend.And then there's this film.....I must be missing something, I know that this kick-started his career into the stratospheric place it is now, but it's one of the most abhorrent, dislikable roles he's ever played.He basically plays a smug little rich boy who gets done over by a pimp and has to make ex amount of cash before his parents get home.Despite the screen presence he has in this, it's impossible to care about the situation he's got himself into because there is no empathetic repercussions to he character. in fact, he almost takes advantage of his situation to start the titular hobby.So if you want to watch a film where a smug little rich boy thinks about turning his back on education for all the wrong reasons, then this is for you.I found myself getting more angrier as the film went on.",Risky Business

In any case, ""Risky Business"" is similar to ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" (1986), but with the artiness of ""Less than Zero"" (1987) minus the melancholy.As far as all-around entertainment goes, this is an easy 7/10, but I have to lower my grade due to the glorification of prostitution. Yes, I realize it's a teen comedy and you have to roll with it to enjoy it, which I did and did.But the portrayal of prostitution & prostitutes is strictly fantasyland and I find it disingenuous and irresponsible. Would all these guys seriously be so hot for these women who have sex with several strangers every work day? Am I the only one who finds this gross? Wouldn't at least some of them be concerned about STDs? Wouldn't the loose lifestyle of prostitution negatively affect the women, psychologically and spiritually?

And in the end, it's a hard-learned lesson of life beyond the yuppie's empty pursuit of money; from a prostitute, no less. Where else are you going to find such a capitalistic coming-of-age story? There's genuine depth to this movie, but also plenty to love on the surface.

26,JamesHitchcock,The wages of sin are a place at Princeton and Rebecca de Mornay in your bed.,4,11 October 2007,"""Risky Business"" is about a teenage boy who falls in love with a prostitute. This was a theme which may well have raised some eyebrows in 1983, although, as Tom Cruise was actually 21 at the time, the film was spared the fate which befell all those Traci Lords films from around the same time.The teenager in question is Joel Goodsen, the son of a wealthy Chicago family who is left at home when his parents go away on holiday. The name ""Goodsen"" was presumably chosen as a pun, but young Joel does not turn out to be quite such a good son as his parents had imagined. Almost the first thing he does, egged on by his cocky friend Miles, is to ring up an escort agency to order the services of a hooker. As the law does not recognise contracts ""tainted by immorality"", prostitutes cannot sue their clients over unpaid bills for services rendered, so I always assumed that they insist that the price be agreed and the money handed over before any sexual activity takes place. In this case, however, it is only after Joel has spent a night of passion with the lovely Lana that she informs him that he owes her $300 dollars, far more than he can afford. I won't go into all the complications of the plot which follow on from this point, but they involve the theft of a valuable ornament belonging to Joel's mother, his trying to rescue Lana from her ""killer pimp"" Guido and his accidentally driving his father's Porsche into Lake Michigan. As he has been specifically warned not to drive this car, he desperately needs funds to pay for the repairs before his parents get back, and comes up with the idea of turning the family home into a brothel where Lana and her friends can entertain his classmates.Joel is a member of ""Future Enterprisers"", a scheme for young people to learn the ways of the commercial world by starting up their own mini-businesses. He claims his brothel enterprise as his entry in the scheme, stating that he has made his money by ""dealing in human fulfilment"". These words give a clue as to the original idea behind the film, which seems to have been conceived as a curious hybrid, a mixture of teenage sex comedy and satire on the capitalist mentality of the yuppie eighties. (Think ""Porky's"" meets ""Wall Street""). Paul Brickman's original idea was to end the film on a downbeat note, showing the adverse consequences of Joel's irresponsible behaviour. Unfortunately, this ending proved unpopular with the test audience, and so it was changed to bring the film into line with the conventions of the teenage comedy. Joel is accepted by Princeton (despite having an unspectacular academic record), Lana becomes his steady girlfriend, presumably on the understanding that she will give up her former line of work, and he avoids getting into serious trouble with his parents, other than having to pay for the ornament which has been recovered slightly damaged. Even ""Guido the killer pimp"" proves to be less dangerous than that description might suggest; his method of dealing with those who cross him is not murder or GBH but simply stealing their furniture.This was Tom Cruise's first starring role, but he does not give any real hint that he would go on to become a major Hollywood name. Joel comes across as an irritatingly smug and cocksure young man, and in his ""pretty boy"" phase of the mid-eighties few could do cocksure better than Cruise. (See ""Cocktail"" for a performance even more irritating than this one). Although Cruise was not actually a member of the ""Brat Pack"" of the eighties, he had a similar screen persona to some of the Brat Packers.The message of the film seems to be (to quote Miles) ""Every now and then say, 'What the heck'. 'What the heck' gives you freedom. Freedom brings opportunity. Opportunity makes your future"". (I have substituted ""heck"" for Miles' rather earthier expletive). This message was presumably originally intended satirically, but the change of ending has robbed the film of any satirical integrity it might have possessed. The film in its present form does not enlighten us as to the mentality behind ""greed is good"", the dot.com boom and bust or the Enron affair. Rather, it ends up as a smug, self-satisfied film which celebrates America's capitalist culture rather than satirises it. The wages of sin are not death but a place at an Ivy League college and Rebecca de Mornay in your bed. 4/10",Risky Business

28,blanbrn,Great teenage film about a boy who learns and grows up while sewing his wild oats.,8,18 February 2008,"1983's ""Risky Business"" clearly has to be one of the better teen angst films of it's time as it was so common with the mid 80's teen films were made like these about coming of age and learning lessons, while most of all learning how to have fun. Set in the windy city of Chicago, Tom Cruise stars in one of his earliest roles as a bright, but yet sheltered teen named Joel Goodsen who's looking to get into an Ivy league school. Joel's a good student yet something is missing from his life the all important fun and happiness that teens want to happen to them before they reach adulthood that's the all important sex romp. So when Joel's parents decide to go out of town and take an extended vacation the house is left all to himself. And thru the idea of a friend Joel decides to check out the newspaper ads for love and fun when he sees the escort advertisements he finds a perfect match description of Lana. When Lana(Rebecca DeMornay) arrives at his door she's the perfect all American dream of the girl next door by being slim, attractive, and blond. Not only just for one night, but until his parents return from extended vacation stay Lana shows Joel the times of his life by seduction and love making! Along the way a young man feels love for the first time, while he's introduced to the seedy side of life from a call girl perspective of seeing her having been abused from her pimp. In fact Joel even shortly runs the call girl ring operation from his house making profitable earnings! Yet in the end like all teenagers after having fun and learning life lessons the hard way things return to normal yet the fun Joel achieved surely liberated him. ""Risky Business"" is a great coming of age movie that proves it's good to have fun while growing up and to sew your wild oats. The acting and performances of Cruise and DeMornay are top notch the scenes of Tom singing ""That old time rock n' roll"" in his underwear and his love making of Lana(DeMornay)on a subway train are also very memorable moments in cinema history. One of Cruise's earliest and best films.",Risky Business

Basically, if Joel did what he was suppose to do then we would not have a movie to watch.I think Tom Cruise was great in this movie - but he's gotten better over the years (IMO). And the film is worth watching for Tom Cruise's performance - and not just for his famous dancing scene in the film.Another reason to watch this movie is the story.

31,ElMaruecan82,A film that embraces its shallowness with manipulative style...,6,21 March 2021,"Paul Brickman's ""Risky Business"" was made 16 years after ""The Graduate"", which is longer a timespan to notice a real change of attitude toward 'money and success' from Hollywood than than the richest percentile of American society, confined in luxurious suburbs.If Mike Nichols's groundbreaking film is one of my all-time favorite, I won't use it as a vector of analysis for ""Risky Business"" but only to highlight how mentalities have changed and not for the better. ""The Graduate"", which had no message whatsoever, was more an exhilaration of youthful insouciance ending with an interrogation mark: two kids staring at what seemed an uncertain future, keeping a bitter afterthought for themselves. The coming-of-age in ""Risky Business"" is more successful, which makes it ironically shallower and more cynical than its predecessor: the fresh-faced teenager of the beginning had a taste of reality by using his house as a bordello and sharing profits with call-girls. As if the underlying message was ""there's no wrong in exploiting women if they're consenting"".I wish I could temper my negative feelings but had the film opted for a full-comedic treatment, it would have maintained a certain subversive approach to its material in a more acceptable way. Comedy can get away with cynicism and John Hughes understood that (""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" is a better elaboration on the same premise), Hughes allowed teens to act as adults within a specific environment that could protect them from the real predicaments of adulthood. Brickman directly exposes Joel in a world that contains sex, money, hookers and pimps, such an extreme that the least we expect is that he will grow if not more mature but more aware of the world outside the parental bubble. But Brickman drives his movie like Daddy's trophy car: fearing the spectacle of reality would turn teenagers off, he turns it into something so artificially glossy and idealized it denies its very claim for realism.It's a real waste of potential because Tom Cruise as Joel Goodson or the story's Ben Braddock is good at embodying the double angst of boys at the verge of adulthood: passing the exams and getting laid, perhaps the two major steps before reaching the twenties, especially in families where the existential trail of Junior is governed from cradle to graduation. But while Ben's character-establishing moment is a long meditative stare and feeling of total pointlessness, Joel's is an erotic dream ending like one of these 'exams' nightmares. To both Ben and Joel, sex is part of the equation but while Ben found salvation by throwing away his parents' authority, his school dreams and ultimately his Alfa Romeo, Joel is still in good terms with his parents, he's admitted to Princeton and did well with his Porsche. That's the 80s in a nutshell, a winning-attitude that the film begs us to sum up in one winning motto ""sometimes, you gotta say 'what the heck'"". At the end, the teenager is no longer awkward, he spots his Ray Ban sunglasses and hold his cigarettes like badges of adult merit.Rebecca De Mornay has the seemingly thankless role of Lana, who makes money by selling her body in a film where women are only seen through the perspective of men. The two other female characters (besides the other hookers) are a young conquest who keeps grunting from the floor above and the mother who ends up berating her son because there's a scratch in her precious egg. Her disappointment serves a purpose: it tells us in hindsight that Joel escaped something even worse but it shows a woman who is so attentive to tiny materialistic details that she's totally out of touch from a certain reality. It's a world where a woman is either a girl who's possessed or who values what she's possessed. Lana is in an in-between position, she exploits Joel and is exploited as well and is the closest to a free woman. Still, her perspectives aren't as bright as Joel who got his family to back him up while she only has her looks, her wits and her connection with a shady pimp named Guido (Joe Pantaliano).Speaking of Joel's family, the father expressed more warmth but only because Sonny got Princeton so there's no display of total unconditional love. It's no wonder that he ends up believing in a success that goes through exploiting other human. This is capitalism, this is the 80s... and this is the breakthrough role of Tom Cruise who'd be the most emblematic star of that era. Such a film couldn't have worked with the looks of Dustin Hoffman, but that's why I always hold the New Hollywood with great respect. ""Risky Business"", encapsulates very well the mentality of its era but never go as far as a full-drama treatment could have taken him or even full-comedy.By the way, I was surprised by how short the iconic ""sliding to frame followed by the Old Time Rock and Rock Dance"" was, and yes that parenthesis was the film's most memorable part, maybe the message was so shallow it was bound to be forgotten. Speaking for myself, my fears started when Lana appeared and they made it out with doors opening, letting streams of cool wind and dead leaves entering the house with soft-core music playing, I thought that it was a dream sequence that would cut with a more 'down-to-earth' interaction but no, that was real. Brickman would do it again with the train scene, with ""Phil Collins's ""In the Air Tonight"", a scene whose overelaborate erotism elevated the film into a world of teen-fantasy: the dream of becoming an adult, making money and love with a beautiful girl. The Graduate symbolically ""killed"" his parents, Joel became them. And with Tangerine's synthesized approach (it's not Simon and Garfunkel though) and Cruise's glasses, the film embraces its shallowness and does it with manipulative style.",Risky Business
32,paul2001sw-1,"Crass in some ways, almost sweet in others",4,12 November 2006,"In theory, it's a great idea for a black comedy: a school-kid calls a prostitute while his parents are away, and ends up running a brothel. But in truth 'Risky Business' is not so comic (the pace is too slow), and not even very black: the hookers are so sweet that they don't even ask for the money beforehand, and even their pimp gets up to nothing worse than stealing a bit of furniture. In fact, films like 'American Pie', which may be thought of as more modern equivalent of this 1980s movie, are (for good or bad) massively more vulgar and direct when it comes to presenting sex. What they have in common is a certain kind of teenage-wish-fulfilment vibe. This film, as befits its age, also features a capitalist morality and the oddly unattractive (to contemporary eyes) fashions of its times. The soundtrack, however, is more 1960s than 1980s, for reasons that are hard to fathom. Add in some fairly wooden acting, and the fact that a certain sort of teenage boy (such as those in this movie) is not the easiest type of character for others to sympathise with, and the result is more tiresome than fun or telling. But it's odd how a film about prostitution can make one feel nostalgic for a gentler age of cinema than the one we have now.",Risky Business

Also Guido takes his stuff and asks him for money, he probably should've called the police to be honest with you. I mean, it didn't make sense for him to be bribed like that, it really is stressful and dangerous for a young kid like him to be in that situation.Near the ending, when things were back to normal and in the right places, the mother was such a wimp just because there was a small crack on her glass egg.

36,The-Sarkologist,Sometimes you just say 'What the ...',9,25 September 2020,"This film was played quite often back when I was young, probably about once every six months to a year, so I have to admit that I have seen it quite a few times. Mind you, it never really stood out in the same way that it did now, probably because I really didn't get many of the concepts in the film that I did when I rewatched it. I guess the main reason that I did decide to rewatch it was because it had been ages since I had last seen it, and I wanted to get a new perspective on the film.In a way it is sort of a more serious version of Ferris Bueller's Day Off in that it charts the course of a guy who has a life changing experience, but it is an experience of their own making. Okay, there are lots of differences between the films, but in a way there are similarities. Like, one person described Ferris Bueller's as a film that we relate to because we all want to get one up on the principle at school. Risky Business is similar in that it is a story about how our hero, Joel, gets the run of the house while his parents are away, has a huge party, trashes his Dad's car, and surprisingly gets away it with. In fact, the only thing that is out of place is a crack in his mother's egg, and while his mother is upset, his Dad just basically writes it off. Oh, and he gets into Princeton despite getting very close to completely bombing out as well as managing to make $8000 in one night, and getting the car back in one piece.The thing is that Joel starts off as a pretty good kid, and you get the impression that he really has no intention of running wild. In fact, at the beginning he mentions that he had an opportunity to sleep with a babysitter, and instead decides to go home just so he doesn't get into trouble. The dream sequence really catches that as well, the fear that he has that one wrong move could completely ruin his life. Yet, there is still that urge in him, no doubt helped along by his friends, to just live it up.Of course, his fears come true, first when the egg disappears, and then when the car lands up in the lake - especially since his Dad explicitly told him that he wasn't allowed to drive the Porsche. Once again, he wouldn't have, if it wasn't for the urging of his friends. Yet, this one week seems to see his hopes and dreams plummet, especially when he loses his cool and is suspended from school, and kicked out of his positions in the extra-curricular activities that he is involved it.The thing is that this film is beautifully crafted, and it is something that really didn't strike me as a thing until I watched it this time. The second thing is that there are a lot of things going on behind the scenes that we don't know about, but are given hints. The fact that the Princeton interviewer goes from 'I don't think you are Ivy League material' to 'I'll see what I can do for you,' to 'Princeton needs a guy like you' is never actually spelt out, and that is good because Joel really doesn't know how it happened, and he is never told. All we know is that he ends up staying at the party much longer than expected - he doesn't leave immediately. I suspect that Lana had a hand in that, though once again that is never spelt out, and that, in my opinion, is what makes this film stand out - it leaves us guessing.The other thing is the uncertainty that lies in Joel's character, and Cruise really does play this well. The tough face he puts on when he is told that he is not Ivy League material, but then he goes and hides in the basement. Yet, his quick thinking in getting back all of his parent's furniture, and his willingness to bend the rules to get the car back in one piece, and the fact that he manages to pull it off. The hints that this could happen were laid out in the film, and it works simply because it is placed in the upper echelons of Chicago. Even more, his ability to get people to come to his house to pay for sex shows that Joel really does have an ability.The thing is, how many people have managed to pull of what Joel managed to pull off, despite the fact that he is a kid, and very uncertain about things as well. They say it is a coming of age film, and yeah, in many ways that it is. However, it has a lot to do with Joel at first being wavering, and through the movie becoming more and more decisive, yet in a way the situation that he lands up in forces him to do that, and forces him to make it through to the end. Yeah, this film really does stand up there, and it is a bit of a shame that it doesn't seem to hold the sway these days that some of the other films managed to have done.",Risky Business

Must see for any Tom Cruise fan. This movie rises far above the typical cheesy teenager genre, because of the superb editing, photography,soundtrack (TANGERINE DREAM) and acting performances. Add to that a brilliant playful direction style and one can certainly understand why this movie still stands strong after 30 years. Can be enjoyed by young AND old,because the youthful, vivacious spirit of this comedy is timeless!It is incredibly (tongue in cheek) kinda funny AND despite all the silly teenager stuff going on, the story still remains credible, with seriously good acting performances. I need some honestly good acting to enjoy a comedy. And the acting is one of the many things that make this movie such a delight to watch again and again. It brought Tom Cruise instant stardom during the eighties.Risky Business tells the hilarious (although predictable) story when the parents have gone away for the weekend and the boys (Tom Cruise) start goofing around with inviting escort girls to their parents' house.

He meets a hooker, Lana (De Mornay) and they start to fall for each other. Lana decides to leave her profession until her pimp, Guido (Pantoliano) tries getting her back and Joel learns the consequences. Lana talks Joel into turning his home into a brothel for one night where their friends can have some fun too. Joel experiences his turn as an enterpriser, but tries to set things right before his parents return home. Armstrong (Revenge of the Nerds) and Pinchot (Perfect Strangers) play Joel's pals, Miles and Barry. This is one of Tom's best and Rebecca and Joe are great in this too.

But ""Risky Business"" is a different story. Here you have a Chicago teenager named Joel(Tom Cruise) who has the house to himself while his parents are gone for the week. He gets down on ""Old time Rock 'n Roll"" by Bob Seger, a true classic scene there. Then he and a friend decided to have a ""girlfriend"" stay for the night. The first one turn out to be a cross-dresser. Then he meets Lana(Rebecca DeMornay) who he hooks up. and thats where things get way out of hand. First, she picks his parents house as a brothel. Second, her former pimp stalks her and it's up to Joel and his friend to stop him. Third, the business is for Joel's further education, which is effective, just not recommended.

Cruise resembles a young Hoffman, and similarly, you don't really get to know Joel - but here, you would have liked to. It doesn't let you into his head the way it feels like it should. Rebecca de Mornay, not really convincing as a prostitute, is similarly unknowable, but I guess that's the point: she's supposed to be a mysterious femme fatale.The movie has some genuinely funny and sexy moments.

Released amidst those countless, braindead comedies, ""Risky Business"" had shown through them all like a ray of light piercing the darkness, going on to earn rave reviews and rocketed its young star, Tom Cruise, into super-stardom; this was solidified by his role in ""Top Gun"" three years later in 1986.""Risky Business"" is a classic example of 80s nostalgia. It's been copied more or less over the years, most notably with this year's ""The Girl Next Door,"" but I dismiss those comparisons with a wave of the hand. Little did Cruise know that when he danced around in his underpants in his parent's living room, that he was making one classic scene that has yet to be topped.This is the first film that I really liked Tom Cruise in after viewing his performance in ""Top Gun."" Like that film, ""Risky Business"" is a movie that can be seen hundreds of times over and over again and still maintain a drastic hold of your attention until the credits begin to roll.As I look back to 1983 when ""Risky Business"" was released, I can't help but wonder just how truly great this movie is. As my one line summary says, Cruise stars as Joel, the good son who's been good too long. When his parents leave him home by himself, he goes on the suggestion of his friend Miles (Curtis Armstrong) to let himself have a little fun while his parents are away. So one night he gets the urge to call up a sexy prostitute named Lana (Rebecca De Mornay) and things soon get ""risky"" following their first encounter...I cannot find enough praise for ""Risky Business,"" as a lot has already been said about it. What I can say is that even though it was released in '83 (two years before I was born), I can't help but wonder how this movie does kind of mirror today's times and at the same time, capture what life in 1983 must have been like.Movies that sometimes also act as time capsules are amongst some of the best of their kind. Whenever a movie captures the essence, or the atmosphere of a particular era, it's bound to become a classic and be praised in the years following its release for its ingenuity and craftsmanship.P.S: Did I also mention that ""Risky Business"" is also a wannabe action flick? No, I don't think that I did. This movie does have one brilliant and well-executed car chase between Joel in his dad's Porsche and Guido, ""the Killer Pimp"" (played by Joe Pantoliano).10/10",Risky Business

47,slokes,The Price Of Admission,7,16 December 2015,"Teen sex comedies took a giant step forward at the same time Tom Cruise made his play for superstardom in this sly, winning film about a boy who shakes off the shackles of respectable suburban life and says ""What the heck,"" or words to that effect.Joel Goodsen (Cruise) is a high-school senior given charge of his parents' stately Glencoe, Illinois mansion while they visit a sick aunt. Prodded by his obnoxious, Harvard-bound pal Miles (Curtis Armstrong), Joel takes Dad's car out for a spin, then gets really adventurous by inviting call girl Lana (Rebecca De Mornay) over for a night of costly sin. How costly? His mother's priceless decorative egg, for starters. To make it up, Joel is forced to latch on with the world's oldest profession to cut his losses.""Risky Business"" is an amusing charmer with a sleek underbelly that slides against the grain of the American dream. All Joel wants to do is make his parents proud by getting into Princeton. Throughout the film, Joel's lifestyle is mocked for its easy manner. Even if Miles is wrong in his advice (something Miles himself breezily admits later), the message of the movie seems to be that Joel needs to shake himself out of his comfortable rut before it becomes his tomb.""I'd really appreciate it if you'd stop laying these little judgments on me while you're leaning on your daddy's $40,000 car,"" Lana says to him at one point, just before she sends the car into Lake Michigan.De Mornay makes the strongest impression in the film, from her unforgettable entrance standing nude in Joel's living room to her hooded, defensive manner whenever Joel presses her about his missing egg. At one point in the DVD commentary, Cruise talks about the music of Tangerine Dream as ""cool, yet it has a soulful, kind of haunting quality."" This seems an apt description of De Mornay's performance, too, a woman who sells her favors for $300 a night but speaks forthrightly when she says: ""Nobody owns me.""Director-writer Paul Brickman gives his film a hypnotic, dreamy tone, from the opening credits where Chicago at night becomes a glittery slo-mo vision to Joel's opening dream sequence, which lays out the central premise of the film, of sex as destroyer of professional ambitions. Joel walks into a bathroom where a beautiful girl is showering, but as he follows her he finds himself at a college boards exam, where he is already three hours late.Speaking of big entrances, Joe Pantoliano shines as Guido, Lana's pimp with a velvet manner and a gun. His scenes with Joel are funny for the rage Guido doesn't express, as he keeps telling Joel he's smart and ""I like you,"" even while making ruin of the boy's life.Brickman had trouble with Warner Brothers getting the film he wanted released; in the end, the last minutes of the film were slightly altered to give Joel and Lana a happier sendoff. It's still a strong ending, as Cruise can be heard telling Brickman in the commentary; the overall message about capitalism's way of getting people to sell themselves short still stands. The bite is still there, only the fangs are a little less sharp.I like the theatrical ending better; ""Risky Business"" as is often risks being too serious for its own good. As it is, there's a lot of business in the middle section that I could do without, as Joel's problems accumulate and his angst is played out as very real. I'm more at ease with the darker material used for antic comedy, like the big hooker convention Joel winds up hosting, and his interview with the Princeton representative (Richard Masur, nicely underplaying his character's own little judgments about Joel).Oh, yeah, and there's that Bob Seger number Joel does in the living room, which takes up a minute of screen time but has come to dominate our memory of the film. It's a good little moment from a good little film, not the greatest ever made, but better than anyone had a right to expect. While dated in places, it still stands up today.",Risky Business
48,gcd70,Average school boy fantasy,4,30 May 2008,"Very average, typical school boy fantasy which, due to its success, may have been responsible for inspiring many other films of its type. Popularity has to be credited to the sexy leads. Spunky (and very young) Cruise and hot, hot De Mornay (débutant) make a good pair, and youthful audiences will be quite happy to ogle them for 99 minutes.Brickman's predictable script is just one long wet dream, and it fails to inspire due to its shallow subject, sex. When Joel Goodsen (Cruise) is quoted as saying that prostitution is ""human fulfilment"", then you know where writer/director Brickman's mind is.None of the cast do anything more than look good, and in the end the best thing for me was the score from Tangerine Dream, which includes some original and some previously recorded material. The soundtrack also includes some cool rock tracks like ""Old Time Rock'n'Roll"", ""In the Air Tonight"" and ""After the Fall"", as well as the classic blues tune ""Mannish Boy (I'm a Man)"".Produced by John Avnet (""Sommersby"" director) and Steve Tisch.Friday, January 10, 1997 - Video",Risky Business
49,Boyo-2,Tom's Charm,6,10 January 2001,"This movie is mostly known for the ""Old Time Rock N' Roll"" scene and the fact that it is the first time most people saw Tom Cruise.  Both are good reasons to see this teen comedy with dramatic overtones.
Tom plays Joel Goodson, who is soon in over his head, as he contacts and spends the evening with a gold-digging call girl named Lana.  When he cannot pay for services rendered, Lana lifts an expensive object from Joel's house, and the movie takes off.  The actors are all very good.  Curtis Armstrong and Bronson Pinchot stand out as Joel's friends and Joe Pantoliano makes a great pimp. 
This movie is essential for all male high schoolers, as it contains about a thousand fantasties, but because its also about growing up, girls and adventure in a Chicago suburb (Ferris Bueller might be living across the street).

A super young Tom Cruise ends up running a high end escort service for his high school buddies? A decent, albeit not entirely sensical, plot shift at the end? I was surprised, to say the least.This is a coming of age story with a moderately strong sexual note to it. The acting is a little off, the story isn't exactly riveting and it doesn't quite button itself up in a satisfying way but it's still an oddly entertaining experience that did have me curious about what was coming next for our intrepid youth. It reminds me a bit of Weird Science, just without all the craziness.Risky Business is a solid 80s flick, it's a bit surreal, it just doesn't really do anything exceptional or particularly noteworthy. I've seen it, I can say I've seen it but there's nothing memorable here that really sets it apart aside from the novelty of seeing a super young Cruise.

52,vertigo_14,The Gambler. (spoilers),8,7 March 2005,"'Risky Business' is one of those more memorable teen 80s movies terribly borrowed upon for the recent comedy, 'The Girl Next Door.' Tom Cruise marked his early entrance into super-stardom as do-gooder teen, Joel Goodson, who has always been scared to take a risk. That is, until his trusting parents leave him alone for the week while they're out of town and his buddy Miles (my 80s favorite, Curtis Armstrong) convinces him to seize the day, or as he so eloquently puts it: ""sometimes you just gotta say what the f... if you can't say it, you can't do it."" Only, good boy Joel needs a lot of coaxing at first.A joke phone call for an escort service by Miles is when Joel meets the seductive Lana (Rebecca Demornay's in her second feature film), a high class prostitute who is about to both free Joel from the rules, but also get him into a lot of trouble in the meantime, everything from fleeing a gun-toting pimp (Joe Pantoliano) to a Porche in Lake Michigan.Despite how awfully naive Tom Cruise's boyish character, Joel, can be at times, this is one of those teen movies that has long survived the decade, and yet, stands apart from most that we might remember (because many were comedies, anyways, whereas this is a mix of several genres). Plus, the appeal also largely comes from this being the ultimate boyhood fantasy--to break the rules and survive every disaster afterwards, to not only come out the hero in the rough, but to get the girl at the same time. Great cast with many familiar 80s actors like Bronson Pinchot, Kevin Anderson (""Miles From Home"") and Raphael Sbarge as Joel's friends, plus Richard Masur as the Princeton admissions officer. Plus, great supporting soundtrack by Tangerine Dream, which, with their usual great mix of synthesizers, xylophones, and pan flutes, adds to the mood so perfectly.Worth a Saturday night viewing for the 80s fan in you.",Risky Business

After a fiery night Joel turns out to lack enough money to pay for the service, which soon leads to the situation to spiral out of control...Still charming and entertaining with an absolutely volcanic De Mornay igniting the screen, ""Risky Business"" does however lack the timeless commentary of ""The Graduate"", while loses in wit and development to the quasi-remake ""The Girl Next Door"". Basically just another teen-movie with style to share, straight-forward, not flashy, but extremely effective.

People would be familiar with Tom Cruise's famous dance scene without having seen the film. For most parts this is a B film. Tom Cruise does shine in this film and I'm glad this was his breakout role, the rest is history. But the film alone is relatively mediocre. I could see how this could have been a big thing when released. But this has somewhat been the start of many similar films years later. Parents are out of town and the kid gets up to no good and ends up having an adventure. Perhaps for this reason it is quite a dated film that's lost some of its luster.

Sure the plot of ""Risky Business"" about a promiscuous teenager befriending a likable hooker named Lana (Rebecca De Mornay) who's still not adjusted to the consequences that come with the job may have qualities about it that are quite surreal. In spite of the flaws in this movie, writer/director Paul Brickman does succeed to keep his audiences on the edge of their seats for long periods of time. Still relatively unknown at the time Tom Cruise in his most youthful role to date, plays a teenager plays the only son of wealthy Mr. and Mrs. Goodson (Nicholas Pryor and Janet Carroll) as they go off on sabbatical leave and depends on young Joel to watch over the house while they're gone. I mean what could go wrong? Joel's friend Miles (Curtis Armstrong) advises Joel to take advantage of his new found freedom. Joel starts drinking the liquor from the liquor cabinet, turns the stereo volume loudly as he dances in his underwear to a Bob Seeger classic and starts bringing in prostitutes into his house for his horny pleasures. From there this movie turns its gears to the over-romanticized soft-core erotic films with its target audience being middle-aged women. The whole concept of sex for money depicted here feels absurdly casual almost like a frat party where they play spin the bottle in hopes that the bottle points in their direction while they go off and engage in intercourse without any of them caring about the dangers of drugs or disease that could raise of cause of concern. Right before the AIDS epidemic took off, ""Risky Business"" would have never made to the cutting room floor. Lana (De Mornay) may have set the teen up in many of the troubles he faced while his parents were gone. Joel has successfully managed to drown his father's Porsche, and get under the gun of Lana's dangerous pimp Guido (Joe Pantoliano). Both incidents are proved costly, Joel agrees for one night to partner up with Lana as he turns his house into a brothel which will help pay for the repairs while he and his friends take their horny pleasures to Lana's co-workers.It's just strangely ironic that Joel found a new lease on coolness once he starts working off his payments by working as a pimp. He shapes his outlook by sporting his hair in the middle (typical 80's right?) He starts donning on Rayban Wayfarers sunglasses (which was a trend setter in that period) and though I don't approve it, he places a cigarette to his mouth that spells out Bogart and Belmondo. There's no real moral passage to give out here, but hey, it's the 1980's back when morals were looser than today's standards. The movie is really high on style and it stands above most romantic comedies of the 1980's and beyond, but to be honest, this movie wasn't a teen comedy at all. It's for satirical purposes to exploit the 1980's materialistic integrity that was cleverly incognito as a teen comedy film. The young cast who became bigger later on excelled in the material that was given to them (even Curtis Armstrong keeps himself being too much of an annoyance). Cruise and De Mormay strive from their roles as they avoid the trap of playing stereotypical characters mainly due to the precision and timing of Brickman's direction and script.",Risky Business

What makes a movie great is it's rewatchability and worthiness to own both of which I would rate tops for Risky Business. Sure the movie is clichéd in its plot, but without a doubt what pushes it to the top of the ranks is the music by Tangerine Dream lifting a decent movie into a period piece of history. If you want to be whisked away to what the 80's felt like delve into the music, the settings, the people, the clothes, and the culture captured in the movie. Particularly good are DeMornay and Pantaliano portraying the shadier walks of lust, greed, and the world's oldest profession. Tom Cruise helps make the film more identifiable with sort of the struggles of high school and what every guy at some point in his life at least entertains the thought of.....worth owning imo.",Risky Business
57,michaeltrivedi,Perfect,7,2 October 2019,"Risky Business is a perfect movie. It is fun all the way through, and yet there is this haunting feeling you get. It creeps you out. This kind of vibe should not exist in a movie about a senior in high school. And yet, it does. Perhaps it's a declaration of the chaos that will ensue as this promising young boy grows older.The movie is about a senior in high school who makes his home into a brothel while his parents are out of town. He collects a great deal of money from doing so, and encounters some trouble with a pimp of one of the ladies. He comes out good in the end, and saves the day a few minutes before his parents come home.

This movie could have been highly entertaining and funny, but I found it to be neither. Instead I thought it was way too safe and with too few ideas. The first half an hour or so is decent, but then it hits a wall and never really goes anywhere.I didn't particularly like the main character either. Considering the movie centres around him, the character should have had a lot more charisma and personality. Instead he's just an 'average Joe' and his reckless streak is actually quite tame. 'Risky Business' should have been more bold and taken more risks. The whole movie just feels safe and lacking in ideas and conviction.",Risky Business
59,hnt_dnl,There's a new star in town!,10,19 June 2009,"Tom Cruise, for my money, will be remembered as one of the best, most bankable stars ever. He's made an eclectic group of films (TOP GUN, RAIN MAN, COLOR OF MONEY, BORN ON 4TH OF JULY, A FEW GOOD MEN, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE, JERRY MAGUIRE, MAGNOLIA, MINORITY REPORT, COLLATERAL) and has ranged in these films for my money from very good to great, mostly great. In every one of these films, Cruise exudes confidence and a persona that etches itself into the film and onto the viewer as we watch him. Ironically, Cruise the man tends to get confused with the actor and there is a core group on ongoing fanatics in Hollywood who simply refuse to accept his brilliance and contribution to American film. The gentlemen can simply ACT. And this film I'm about to review is the genesis of this great actor.In retrospect, I had a difficult time thinking about what were truly the best films of the 1980s. The 80s decade is widely seen as a pop culture decade with a LOT of entertaining movies, but very few truly great ""films"". Fortunately, RISKY BUSINESS (premiering in 1983) manages to overcome this, and for me, is easily a top 10 film of the decade, maybe top 5! Why? It is really ahead of its time. A film starring mostly teenagers (or actors playing teens), it is not the standard teen fare that the 80s threw at us. In fact, it is very adult in its mood, tone, and atmosphere. It is one of the atmospheric films I've ever seen, almost film noir-ish in nature. Most of the scenes are set at night and it has a sexy, cool mood that permeates throughout.As I've mentioned, RISKY BUSINESS stars the great Tom Cruise in his starmaking performance as Joel Goodsen. Cruise was about 21 when he played 17-year old high-school senior Joel. Joel is a rather shy, wimpy, underconfident son of upper class parents who live in a Chicago suburb. The start of the film has Joel and his friends (including Barry and Miles, played wonderfully by Bronson Pinchot and Curtis Armstrong) pondering their futures and places in the world. Joel is a member of the Future Entrepreneurs at his school and they must essay a project where they explain how they made money.Joel's parents go on vacation and he has the house to himself. Joel has a little fun while they're away, including that iconic scene where Cruise, sans pants, dances in his folks' living room to ""Old Time Rock n' Roll"". Also, Joel gets the number of a call girl service and gets Lana! Ah, Lana! The object of many a teenage boys fantasies. Rebecca DeMornay plays Lana and this has got to be one of the sexiest, surest performances by an actress ever in such a role! I've seen a lot of ""hooker"" roles, but many of them seem either dull or fake. DeMornay plays it very sensually, yet still exudes believability. After their encounter, Lana steals an expensive object from Joel's home and he goes after her to recover it. As it turns out, Lana is in trouble because she owes money to her pimp Guido (Joe Pantoliano in a memorably sleazy performance).Needing each other (Lana needs a place to stay and Joel needs confidence!), Joel and Lana form an initially uneasy alliance, then form the plan to turn Joel's home into a brothel. Joel enlists his friends as ""Johns"" and Lana calls up her girls to provide, the, errr, service. Along the way, Joel gets into various scrapes and trouble, but in the end learns a valuable lesson about life and how people think and operate. In the end, I'm sure he's the better for having survived it! RISKY BUSINESS is a gem of a film that in hindsight should have been an even bigger hit than it was when it came out. The performances are uniformly excellent, the dialogue is top-notch, and the mood of the film is so self-assured and focused that you know an expert filmmaker must have been behind it. That filmmaker is director Paul Brickman and he gave us an American classic. Highly recommended viewing: RISKY BUSINESS!",Risky Business
60,mattymatt4ever,"Funny, amiable and well done",7,4 May 2001,"I think the most noteworthy element of ""Risky Business"" is its style.  The movie starts with a great opening shot of Chicago at night.  Then it cuts to a close-up of Tom Cruise, staring into the camera with sunglasses propped downward--John Lennon-style--and a cigarette hanging out his mouth.  And I like the unique way the scene was handled where his parents were leaving to the airport, and we watch the entire scene through his eyes--a great point of view shot.  Plus, the musical score is brilliant and fits the darkly comic mood of each scene perfectly.  We're also stricken with great use of Phil Collin's song--I forgot the title--in the train sequence.  And of course the film contains a line that I will always remember and abide by: ""Sometimes you just have to say 'What the f***.'""The comedy is appealing and funny, and done with good timing.  Curtis Armstrong--of ""Revenge of the Nerds"" fame--is likable as Cruise's partner in crime.  And so is Bronson Pinchot and my favorite underrated actor Joe Pantoliano, who should've become a household name with his portrayal of Guido the Pimp.  Even though I wouldn't regard this as one of the funniest films ever made and the pinnacle of all teen movies--though it's a masterpiece compared to some of the teen flicks in recent years--it's a fun, feel-good movie that celebrates the good things about adolescence--though you have to suffer dirty consequences to get some of those good things.  The story is predictable and implausible at times, but it's not meant to be an Oscar winner.  Besides, it's fun to see Tom Cruise as sort of a geek...LOL.

It's a comedy-drama woefully short on comedy and it doesn't do much better in the drama department. There's the famous scene with Tom Cruise and Old Time Rock and Roll. It's that scene more than anything else which people seem to remember all these years later. Everybody seems to forget the rest of the movie rather stinks.Cruise plays Joel Goodsen, a suburban Chicago teen whose parents are away on a trip. Joel orders up a hooker out of a newspaper advertisement. Apparently you can do that sort of thing in suburban Chicago. Who knew? Anyhow the lovely Lana, played by Rebecca De Mornay, shows Joel the time of his life. Unfortunately Joel doesn't have the money to pay for his dream night and while he goes to the bank to scrounge up some cash Lana steals his mother's precious crystal egg. Things go downhill from there, both for Joel and the movie. There's a slimy pimp with a temper and a gun, more hookers and an expensive car going for a swim. Somewhere along the way Joel and Lana kinda sorta maybe fall in love. Lana needs money to get away from killer pimp Guido. He just had to be named Guido didn't he? Joel needs a whole lot of money to clean up the mess he's made of his comfortable suburban life before his parents get back. The fresh-faced teen and the friendly neighborhood hooker come up with an interesting, and of course risky, business plan to solve their problems.So yeah, this movie is stupid on all kinds of levels. You could forgive that if it was at least entertaining but it's not. When the one thing people remember about a movie is the star dancing in his underwear that should tell you something. There's not much else memorable here. Cruise and De Mornay work well together and Joe Pantoliano has some good moments as the villainous Guido. The lead performers make the best out of this that they can. It's their efforts and charisma which save the movie from being truly wretched. They can make the movie bearable but they can't make it good. The story is largely absurd. It's one stupid, nonsensical thing after another. Entertainment value is sorely lacking, there's not much here to keep you engaged in the proceedings. The whole thing is rather dull. If people loved this movie when it first came out I hope for their sake they don't watch it again. They'll be left wondering what in the world they were thinking. Some movies age like a fine wine. This movie ages like a moldy crust of bread.",Risky Business
62,Stampsfightclub,engaging 'sex' driven comedy,8,10 November 2006,"The narrative.A fast energetic story with many funny twists and turns, promoting healthy viewing for older audiences. The beginning is amazing, sensational even. Cruise stands in a state of complete wonder and fascination. His narration is superb and conforms to a really energetic opening to a great story. The film is consistent throughout with engaging characters that are easy to understand and feel for at points but also to laugh with, allowing the story to flow consistently. Some maybe confused during the middle when De Mornay (hand that rocked the cradle) and Cruise (Magnolia) get involve in the business proposition but the story is always entertaining, always wanting to know what happens to the characters. The twists and turns encoded add to the excitement. The cinematography is also great, allowing for a picturesque view on America in some scenes.Characters and acting.Cruise has had his share of bad criticism but here he gives a great account of a stereotypical horny teenager just wanting to appreciate life in his own way. His character thinks the way normal teenagers do, assuming they all want sex and to have a good time, but allows a more concerned approach to different aspects of life. He performs well alongside the equally sex driven Rebecca who is also spellbinding in her role as the prostitute. Lala is certainly an interesting character with a very teasing attitude towards Cruise. Her actions in the film are very 'fruity' and conform perfectly to her personality as a troubled but trying to be positive young woman. The relationship between them in context is great because it isn't a conventional love story as most are these days, e.g. Love actually. It adds a different niche to the romantic genre and audiences can easily accept the ideologies of a different more anticipating and difficult un-trusting relationship.watch it if...energetic passionate sexual driven films are your cup of tea",Risky Business
63,KnightsofNi11,A surreal failure,4,28 June 2012,"Putting a surreal twist on a teen comedy sounds like an interesting idea right? Well I thought it would turn out pretty good, but after watching Risky Business I realized that it's not quite as good of an idea as you would think, at least not in this case. Risky Business stars Tom Cruise as Joel Goodsen, a brainy teen who hopes to go into business one day. But those aspirations are put in jeopardy when his parents go out of town for a week and Joel decides to live a little. He invites a prostitute to his home and, when her charge ends up being more than he thought, Joel can't pay her and she ends up stealing a prized possession of his mother's. Joel then has to track her down, only to find out that her pimp now has what he wants, so Joel must come up with some way to get it back, while also going to school. It's an incredibly strange film where nothing feels natural and the whole plot feels forced. It's not what you'd expect which, in this case, isn't a good thing.What director Paul Brickman is trying to accomplish here is giving a dream like surrealist quality to a teen comedy through the music and camera angles. I'll admit it's an interesting idea and I commend Brickman on his bravery to do something different with a genre we all thought we knew like the back of our hands. Unfortunately, the result of this bravery was a failure. Rather than creating something fascinatingly unique, the style of this film comes off as shallow and pretentious. It tries to hard as it crams its seemingly acute sense of style down our throats. The idea gets old quick and it makes for an obnoxious film that has no sincereness to it and only feels like someone trying to hard.One of the biggest elements employed to achieve the film's surrealism is subduing all the characters to a highly unnatural and almost catatonic state of interaction with one another. Given the urgency of the situation the characters find themselves in you would think the reactions would be a little more concerned and a little more hasty. Instead, we find Tom Cruise having breakfast and being friends with the girl who might have just ruined his entire future. It makes no sense and there are many moments of forced interaction that destroy an otherwise creative storyline.Simply put, Risky Business is just an awful film. It really tried hard to do something different, but it went overboard and made a totally unbelievable and lifeless film. The unrelenting style just beats you over the head, the characters are soulless, the music is weird, and the film just sucks. Given the thought that went into the film before it was made, I would say that it could have been very good. Sadly, it falls as flat as is possibly could.",Risky Business
64,TOMASBBloodhound,"""I deal in human fulfillment.""",9,12 July 2006,"Risky Business is a film people unfortunately seem to forget about when they're listing off great teen movies. Tom Cruise, in his first major role, is wonderful as Joel Goodson. He's a boy-next-door type whose life spirals wildly out of control when his parents leave him alone for a few days. Joel is a decent student looking to spend his time wisely during his senior year of high school and hopefully get into a good college. He finds out the hard way that a few bad decisions can lead to all kinds of problems and possibly ruin your future at that age. The film has the intelligence of a John Hughes film combined with the sexual content of a Porky's film. Risky Business is the best of both worlds, if you look at it that way.Tom Cruise's Joel Goodson seems to have a lot going for him. He is the only child living in a nice house in suburban Chicago with his loving parents. You get the sense that he's never been left alone for any extended period of time the way they fawn over him before they leave. After leaving him a decent wad of money and a few instructions about what to do and what not to do around the house, his parents split, and Joel is left all alone. Things go downhill fairly quickly. His best friend (that scene stealing Curtis Armstrong)orders him a prostitute that will show up right at his front door. Needless to say, the person who shows up is not what Joel is looking for. In a fit of sexual frustration, Joels orders the services of the gorgeous, but high-priced Rebecca De Mornay. After a wild night of sex, she informs him he owes her $300. That is substantially more money than his parents left him. Before his dilemma is solved, Joel crashes his father's Porshe in Lake Michigan, gets suspended from school, has a crazed pimp on his tail, and winds up turning his home into a brothel for one night to pay for all the damages he's caused.This plot could have been crafted into an awful movie. Director Paul Brickman knows what he's doing, though. He gives each of his main characters enough dimension that we as the audience actually care what happens to them. We feel Joel's agony as his future seems in doubt during the film's final half hour. Rebecca De Morany is given considerably more depth that you'd think, but we are never allowed to get close enough to truly trust her. Joe Pantoliano is terrific as her pimp, also.Is this film believable? Heavens no. It's plays more like a young man's sexual fantasy run amok. The first scene of the movie mirrors this theme. We see Joel dreaming about having sex with a hot young woman in the shower, then finding himself three hours late for his college entrance exam. We walk such a fine line between pleasure and big trouble at that age.....9 of 10 stars The Hound.",Risky Business

This surprise hit brought an element of sophistication that was absent from a lot of the teen comedies that were populating the screen in the 1980's. This movie boasts a smart screenplay, imaginative direction, a memorable musical score, and on-target performances from Cruise, DeMornay, Curtis Armstrong, Joe Pantoliano (memorable as a slimy pimp), Bronson Pinchot, and Janet Carroll.

It would be great to appreciate this film back when it won't take that much for the average American to laugh.Aside from the laughs,it was also a great movie that has great themes such as materialism,greed,getting into college and meeting the high standards set up by one's parents.",Risky Business

75,jackasstrange,Not another stupid teenager film...,8,19 December 2013,"In fact, Risky Business is indeed a very smart and indeed a good film. A breath of fresh air in that miserable 'teenager genre' that became a hit in the 80s. Risky Business is a different and much better film than the conventional 'teenager' film, simply because it's smarter than them. It touches in meaningful themes such as the doubt in relation of future, which surely it's a phase that most teenagers pass through, specifically if that teenager is someone that is closing the high- school, just like Cruise's character. Doubts like what to be in the future is definitely something that all teenagers suffers. What to work at? Work only for money? For doing something great? Or simply work in something with personal value, something that you can relate for? Well, it's a theme explored in the film. But it not only talks about that. It talks also about social differences and how the life is hard for those who don't have a good family, just like in the case of De Mornay's characters, which escaped from home. She contrasts with Cruise's character, which don't has any problems with his parents or economic troubles, unlike her. The sex scenes were implied. The nudity, very brief. Not a graphic film at all, what just makes it different 'teenager' film. The acting is also miles superior if compared to other films in the genre. Cruise gives a pretty god performance to the screen, even more powerful if you counts the fact that it was his debut film. The soundtrack was typical from a 80s film. Not a fan, but some people may enjoy the beats. I guess.Anyways, it's a good film and definitely one of the best comedies from the 80s, if not the best. 8.5/10",Risky Business

77,patriciogl10,"Fun, sexy, smart and the start of Tom Cruise's rise to stardom.",8,31 August 2018,"I bet that the first thing that pops into your head when you think of Risky Business is that classic scene where Tom Cruise dances in his underwear to Old Time Rock and Roll, but obviously this coming-of-age story is much more than that. Joel Goodson (Tom Cruise) is a naive, horny and morally-correct young man who is worried about securing his future and at the same time he's driven by his libido. He wants to play his cards right and safe in order to assure his entrance to a great college; but he decides to follow the advice of his friend Miles (Curtis Armstrong) and take a chance for once in his life. When his parents are away on a trip, he engages in a phone conversation with call girl Lana (Rebecca De Mornay) and has sex with her in his house. The next morning, with no money to pay her, he goes to cash some checks given to him by his grandparents; when he returns he finds that she left with a valuable crystal egg that belongs to his mother. Later he rescues Lana from her deranged ""pimp"" and the two start to hang out more often at his house. One night they go out near a lake and sit there in the car and talk; she feels judged by him and walks away mad, then Joel's father's car falls into the lake and he now has to pay for the damages. Then, an idea comes to mind, a profitable business right under their noses; Lana entices Joel into this morally questionable venture, which has Joel interested because he is a part of Future Enterprises, a competitive workshop in which students from different schools produce a brand to try to sell a certain product, and wants to study business in college. Lana brings all his call girlfriends to Joel's house, and he brings his friends and all of a sudden his house turns into a brothel.It's a rather creative and ballsy plot for a teen comedy from the 80s; it always plays smart and only has Tom Cruise looking cool in a couple of scenes, because in most of the screen time he has, he appears naive, insecure and uncertain. But there's more than meets the eye; a clear undertone that speaks aloud about the capitalist nature of suburban America and the distress of having to thrive on economically to a large extent. There are a few lessons to be learned for Joel, and I like to think that he eventually does.Bottomline, this is definitely a different coming-of-age comedy, that tries to distance itself from other more goofy or nonsensical ones without necessarily wanting to be taken seriously, but firm enough to leave social commentary on the side. And what else does it have? A young Tom Cruise on the way to become a bona fide superstar; and let's not forget about his sensual scenes with Rebecca De Mornay, which remain tasteful to this day.So if you enjoy teenage movies, you will definitely love Risky Business. I know I did.",Risky Business
78,brefane,Get Smart,4,11 July 2017,"Compared to The Graduate in several reviews, Risky Business is an initially enjoyable, cynical teenage fantasy that is ultimately disappointing as it quickly runs out of original ideas and becomes highly, and frustratingly, improbable with everything working out too perfectly in the end. Tom Cruise has never been more appealing, and the famous scene where he dances in his underwear is still a highlight, but his character becomes exasperating especially when he leaves the hooker alone in his parents house not once, but twice the easier for her to rob him blind. De Mornay's hooker is pretty, but unlikable and she and Cruise have no real chemistry; their sex scenes have no heat and
I wish Joel hadn't rescued her from her pimp: they deserve one another. After a while you wonder why he doesn't call the police to get rid of her and her friend and Guido the pimp. And wouldn't the police show up during the wild house party with cars jamming the street and a truck delivering a bed in the middle of the night! This in the same affluent Chicago suburb that was the setting of Ordinary People. The film has an unearned reputation as some sort of classic, but even with superior production values for this genre Risky Business is only a better than average teen comedy which is saying very little.",Risky Business

And this film is, very much, far fetched in so many ways that I don't really want to take the time to list them all. The character's personalities come off as a bit too fake in this movie. They whimsically go through actions as if they have no repercussions.

This is a movie that just about every teen will enjoy, and adults will enjoy it just as well.This movie is about a subject that every teen would love, to have the entire house to yourself while your parents are away on vacation. That is what Joel Goodsen(played by Tom Cruise in his breakthrough role) gets. While he is by himself, he realizes that not everything is all it seems when a few things happen and he is in need of money, much more than what his parents left him.This is one of my favorite movies of the '80's. This has plenty of great scenes, as well as a famous scene that is referenced in many other movies and TV shows. This has been copied many times, but never been equaled. Not only that, but the humor is also hilarious, at times uproarious.This is definitely worth watching.

87,blazesnakes9,The movie that made Tom Cruise a star.,10,25 December 2013,"Movie stars in the beginning of their careers were already known in their early 30's. Back in those days, movie stars like Dustin Hoffman, Robert Redford, Clint Eastwood and Burt Reynolds, were their 30's when they first started acting in their first feature-length motion picture. But in 1983, an young male movie star emerged and arrived in the middle of the movie spotlight and captured our attention to the big screen. That young male movie star was, obviously, Tom Cruise. Cruise was already starting out in little movies like Losin' It and All the Right Moves. But, it was the movie, Risky Business that made him a star in the first place. The movie stars Cruise as a young Chicago teenager named Joel, who is a high-school senior, trying to get into Princeton. His best friend, Miles, provides him with advice by having Joel express his own freedom as a young man. Joel does get that opportunity when his parents leave him behind to look after the house while they spent the weekend together, leaving Joel alone in the house. Soon enough, Joel gets himself involved in a series of unfortunate events. He wasted his money on a male transvestite, who offered him advice to meet a girl named Lana. Lana is played by Rebecca De Mornay, and she and Cruise start to develop a relationship between the two of them. But, even that doesn't stop the upcoming mayhem that Joel has to face. His father's Porsche ends in Lake Michigan and wounded up getting a bill from the car dealership. Also, his mother's egg is stolen from Lana and even his house is burglarized by a pimp, Guido, who is also Lana's old boyfriend. What can Joel do now? His suggestion? Make his house into a brothel and pay the bill off on the money he gathered up. This movie has been known as simply a teenage sex comedy. It is, yes. But, there's something else to add. In the early 1980's, teenage sex films were criticized as being harsh and mean-spirited to women, treating them as pieces of meat and making the teenage boys look like jerks and studs. This movie is different from those other movies. The reason why is that Risky Business is smart, funny, and also sexy. It is smart because of the scenes showing Joel trying to solve each problem during the whole entire weekend. For example, when his father's Porsche ends up in Lake Michigan, he has to come up with the money to pay off the bill. How does he do it? He builds his own business enterprise and learns from it. To me, Joel is one of those teenagers who thinks smart and acts smart to get the job done. He is not like any other teenager in the movies that act dumb and think unintelligently about the choices he makes. He also learns from the prostitute, Lana, about business. Another theme that comes up during this entire movie is the class differences between Joel's family and Lana. Joel's family is wealthy and from the look of it, it seems that Joel is locked up inside his own self, because of his parents. Lana is also like Joel. Lana is locked up inside herself and even have to endure the pain and suffering from her pimp. It is funny in the way the movie presents the humor. Joel's problems are very funny at times and also not at all, mean-spirited. Most of these teenage movies created mean-spirited behavior amongst the characters and that kind of behavior ruins the movie-going experience, mainly because some screenwriters or the creators for those movies don't really see what teenagers are going through during this era. They don't understand that teenagers want to have good role models and not mean-spirited teenagers. The third is that the movie is sexy. It is erotic in the way that Joel fantasizes about love. In the beginning of Risky Business, he daydreams about meeting a woman in a steamy bathroom. Also, Rebecca De Mornay was really convincing and also very pretty playing her character. She teaches Joel about the meaning of decisions and how to get ahead in life, rather than waiting around for it to come to you. Risky Business is excellent, showcasing what is going in the mind of a teenage boy and showing us the innocence of growing up through our adolescent years. Tom Cruise certainly does shines as the main character. He is believable, convincing and even funny when it comes to breaking the humor throughout the movie. It is truly one of the best films of 1983. ★★★★ 4 stars.",Risky Business
88,lakishaferguson21,Decent,6,21 August 2020,Thought it was enjoyable plus I loved seeing many recognizable faces in early roles. Personally I didn't find comedic and the ending was weak. Frankly I don't understand y Joel would still be enamored with this woman or friends with Myles by the end. She was the cause of the Porsche going in the lake and he was the reason EVERYTHING occurred. Ultimately if he hadn't come from a rich environment he never would've been able to afford to pay for the car or buy his stuff back.,Risky Business
89,reneweddan,Take this for what it is,10,5 October 2010,"People, regardless of positive or negative reviews, take this movie too seriously. They try to connect this film with society today, the greed for money and power. This movie was released in 1983, just watch it for the great film that it is, a classic.Sure this film focuses on issues at hand, but it's not meant to. Also, this film is enjoyable for what it is, and many other films have taken ideas from this film which might be why the ratings are low, but keep in mind this was released before those.Tom Cruise does great as he usually does, but he's near his prime in this film. I enjoyed it, as well as the script and the dialogue. It was witty, unpredictable, and enjoyable.Try not to associate American politics and economics with this film, otherwise you'll be expecting a deeper plot and a more suitable ending.",Risky Business
90,Putzberger,Blackhearted Social Commentary w/Lots of Hot Sex,9,17 March 2006,"If Nietzche had a sense of humor (forget ""The Gay Science""), liked girls (remember ""The Gay Science""), lived to be about 200 and became a director, ""Risky Business"" is the film he might have made. Beautiful to the point of decadent and unburdened by that bourgeois affectation called ""conscience,"" ""Risky Business"" makes the extremely disturbing argument that we live in a corrupt, hypocritical society and the only way to survive is the abandonment of morality. That's a creepy and depressing message. Is this a creepy movie? No, it's actually rather charming. Is this a depressing movie? No, it's actually lots of fun. It's the perversity of ""Risky Business"" that makes it so enduring. Well, that and Tom Cruise dancing in his underwear.Speaking of Cruise, he's as stiff and bland as ever in this film, and he's paired with Rebecca DeMornay, who looks like a rodent. But through the miracle of lighting and soft-focus photography, the camera transforms these two unremarkable people into matinée idols. They do lots of sleazy, illegal, dangerous things. Some more moralistic film maker might have them pay for their crimes, or set their nefarious exploits to some kind of twangy, dissonant soundtrack. In ""Risky Business,"" our hero Joel and his hooker girlfriend don't suffer for their sins, and they commit their various atrocities to the lively, burbly proto-electronica of Tangerine Dream. And there's no ironic distance between the film and its characters -- we are expected to identify completely with these two soulless strivers, and we do. ""Risky Business"" is genuinely decadent art.If you're interested in plot, it's pretty screwball/teen sex comedy -- teenaged boy (Cruise) seeks sex, finds it and winds up learning a life lesson as well (although it's about money, not love). There are fun set pieces, like the car chase with Guido the Killer Pimp, the visit from the Princeton recruiter and Cruise pleading with a granite-faced school nurse to excuse him from class. But there are problems, too. I can forgive ""Risky Business"" for its rancid ideology. I can't forgive it for making Tom Cruise such a gigantic star that they have to craft films around his grinning, boring invulnerability (see ""Rain Man"" and ""Vanilla Sky,"" in which he condescends to be human). And the movie elevated ""Old Time Rock and Roll,"" Bob Seger's ode to curmudgeonly close-mindedness, from a minor annoyance to a plague on our culture. It's a perverse tribute to this film's strength that it could make such a crappy song into a near-standard. Damn the filmmakers.",Risky Business

94,tresdodge,Fun but no classic,6,21 December 2004,"A preppy high schooler (Tom Cruise) is left alone in his parents huge mansion while they go on holiday. This new found independence leads him to throw caution to the wind and just say 'what the f**k'. He proceeds to take out his parents beloved Porsche and becomes involved with a call girl ( Rebbeca De Mornay) which inevitably leads to nothing but trouble.This film can be shelved alongside such 80's classics as 'The Breakfast Club' and 'Ferris Buellers Day Off'. However, unlike the aforementioned two, it is not as accomplished, with a weaker script and and less intriguing characters. A young Tom Cruise and Rebecca De Mornay both play there parts very competently and Joe Pantoliano is extremely good as the pimp, however, this does not make up for very dull parts of the film that drag on and have little humor. There a couple of laugh out loud moments but overall it does not have a great deal of spark and has not stood the test of time well, looking as it does fairly dated. On the positive side, if you get a few mates round, crack open some beers and get into the 80's groove, then your sure to enjoy this. Even if just to take the mickey out of the cheesy 80's fashion and somewhat corny lines.",Risky Business
95,soymilk,A different kind of coming of age story,7,25 March 2005,"Well, I'm sure we're all aware of what the greatest legacy this movie left to the world inevitably was  that's right, that short but sweet sequence where a young Tom Cruise dances round his parents' living room to 'Old Time Rock n Roll' wearing nothing but his shirt and underpants. A humble little scene that's long since managed to earn itself a place amongst the most fondly remembered movie moments of all time (it's been parodied on God knows how many occasions). And, why shouldn't it? It's well-shot, funny, engaging and really captures that lightly rebellious urge that all of us felt and wanted to unleash at some point at that age. It also stands out as one of the few entirely light-hearted scenes in a film that, in spite of its reputation for being the racy teenage comedy of its decade, constitutes a very peculiar mix of feelings and attitudes overall. Perhaps the most remarkable thing about 'Risky Business' is, amidst all the high school banter and risqué situations, just how downbeat and ambiguous and it manages to be. No, this definitely isn't your average adolescent romp - even the would-be feel-good moments have an air of sombreness attached, and it leaves its viewers not entirely sure what to make of the way of things turn out.In some ways it serves as quite an appropriate reflection of the constant unease our young protagonist feels  torn between securing a prosperous position in his academic future and going out and living it up in his youth, Joel gets more than he bargained for when his parents head out of town for a brief period, leaving him with the house to himself. One thing leads to another, and it isn't long before he finds himself sucked into the lucrative world of pimps and prostitutes, no less when one such young call girl named Lana comes to him seeking refuge from her domineering 'manager'. It sets itself up nicely for the perfect blending of outrageous comedy and human drama, but in practice isn't overwhelmingly successful  a lot of the time, the two approaches seem to be imposing on each other rather than working together effectively. The serious pathos, especially those concerning Lana's difficult past, go a little more understated than they really should, while the sense of humour is, for the most part, irritatingly tame. The real laugh-out-loud moments are few and far between (that said, the ones that are there hit the spot with the right precision, including quite possibly the funniest sight gag involving a flooded car you'll ever get to feast your eyes upon). And, like many movies put together in the 1980s, its age can't help but show a little  the archaic train sequences being the biggest betrayers here, particularly during the opening credits.In spite of these weaknesses, 'Risky Business' still holds true as quite a unique and fascinating piece of viewing, mainly because, like I said, it takes a surprisingly sober slant on its subject matter. People always seem to remember its true appeal as lying in the fact that it allows its central character to live out a situation that real teens can only dream of, but it has a lot more value than just as a male adolescent indulgence fantasy. What distinguishes 'Risky Business' from other flicks in its field is that whole underlying sense it embodies of an innocence slipping away, in some ways for good and others for bad. Joel starts out as a naïve and good-intentioned kid who can't so much as microwave his own frozen dinner, and is happy just to use his time of parental liberation following bold but harmless pursuits (which leads us onto the whole dancing around in your shirt and underwear thing). But his experiences with Lana and her friends cause him to gradually wisen up to the world around him  and the film, perhaps more effectively than anything else, really captures that uneasy feeling of 'no going back'. What this movie is really about is growing up and learning to get by in a materialistic and dog-eat-dog world where compromises must sometimes be made, and in that sense there's something undeniably sad and wistful about it. What keeps it from becoming too tart for its own good is the natural charisma it has in its hero Joel  one of Tom Cruise's earliest roles, and still one of his most memorable to this day, he remains accessible and amiable to us no matter what he goes through. That it avoids having to establish a firm moral standpoint on the whole prostitution issue will cause it to lose favour with a few of its viewers, but in contrasting the differing perspectives of sheltered, well-off kids like Joel and Miles with those who've had it considerably less easy, like Lana, it does well enough.Don't approach 'Risky Business' expecting an all-out laugh-riot, because that's unlikely to be what you'll get. But as a coming of age story about a high school student at a crossroad in his life, it's a flawed yet likable, taut and absorbing experience.And that's why more than just that underwear scene has survived this long.Grade: B+",Risky Business

It was Tom himself who kept this timeless classic alive including the improvised dancing scene in his underwear during the absence of his folks, his acting skills were flawless and terrific in his first debut film. In Risky Business, Joel Goodson is like any typical high school student who feels concerned about going to college despite his low grades and SAT scores. Unusual circumstances lead him to meet and have sex with Lana the call girl, and getting chased by her greedy pimp Guido while making a getaway in his father's Porsche.

The film on the other hand, I have major issues with. Cruise has great charisma, but the choices his character makes are increasingly dumb. Like how is he not furious at this prostitute for stealing from him the first time? He barely said anything to her, then let her stay over again. Why didn't he go to police in first place? I honestly can't respect this character if he has zero responsibility. Everything bad that happened to him in this movie was ultimately his own fault.Overall, it was a fun movie, but took way too much suspension of disbelief to get through and I just could not respect the character at all.",Risky Business
98,andy-933-696608,Risky Business movie Review,7,26 February 2011,"Starting out as a typical erotic dream, with a specific and eventual learning experience to the hero of this story, Joel Goodsen (Cruise), a high school student, blessed with talent in business, wealth, and yet plagued with a limited capacity to act on what he'll consider risky and consequential. ""In life, sometimes you've just got to just say, What the f "". These are wise words indeed coming from a Joel's zany friend Miles (Armstrong), although I rather say ""the f with it"". The main point is that life is to short, and when you have even a slight shot at anything, you got to grab it by the balls, and in this case not Joel's whenever he is in private. Joel is portrayed as a character who is just restrained, no doubt his parents are responsible for that , as they mean well in their efforts to send him off to Princeton, and even so much as leaving him with the house to himself. Despite this constantly mentioned array of freedom his friends remind him he has at his disposal, Joel's only sense of fun and excitement resort from a slow dance to the magic of ""Old Time Rock and Roll"". No much of a thrill, especially when having his own quiet time jerking off seems even less dignified. Fortunately, Mile's own stupidity leads Joel down to the right path of discovering more than just freedom, but an opportunity beyond the already displayed capabilities of his risk free behavior. The arrival of transvestite call girl, named Jackie, (one word: Yikes!) gives Joel a real chance to score, and real chance to get a girl to say ""Oh God"". The slick, and even charmingly approaching call girl Lana (Mornay) does more than take Joel's virginity, as she involves him into her array of insanity. An angry pimp, a prosperous in home brothel, and a stolen egg that top it all off, bring Joel towards discovering his talents as he risks his own future in putting things back together. The stolen egg belonging to his mother signifies her very trust for him, and the brothel, being my personally favorite scene of the film, as we viewers witness Joel show a side of himself that even he never knew. None of the business courses he had attended could have ever brought him the more than financially, but even furthermore scholastically rewards to come, all out of the very brilliance of his own persuasion and slickly witted perseverance. Anyone would consider a chance to enroll into Princeton University to be the opportunity of a lifetime, and in Joel's case it seemed like a opportunity ready to crash. As the many men and women flourished in the temporary brothel, an interviewer setup for Joel's enrollment arrives with questionable indifference, speculating more and more as he examines Joel in an interview most instructors would regard as an obvious rejection, only to end in an official enrollment to Joel's surprise. The charm of any beautiful woman can move a man to making the best choices. In the Princeton instructor's case, enough satisfaction to approve of the interview and accepting Joel as a student. Despite the fortune of Joel's risks and benefits came with deception and more bargaining. Lana's pimp, Guido (Pantiliano), witty, and convinced in the hopes that Joel has a brain to use, takes all he can from his own house, and sets up a deal, with the chance to get it all back in order to make some quick bucks. As risky and almost consequential as Joel's timing was, his furniture is returned, his parents are enthralled at his future in Princeton with little knowledge of his craziness and only the mere disappointment of a cracked glass egg, and his own chances with a woman who makes a living off the phone calls of often lonely and desperate men is how the film ends. ""Risky Business"" is interesting enough in both the comedy of its mature elements, as well as having its lead Tom Cruise portray a character lacking the stones to actually take risks, thus making the events he experiences more enthralling and more influential on his character development. At first he was careful and overly cautious, but in the time he spent with his new girl Lana, and even in the dealings of sleazy opportunist, his view of how to grab life by the balls has given him more than just a little weekend to remember, but something everyone wants, the excitement of never truly knowing how anything will turn out in our own hands. It's that very thrill that enveloped Joel, both scaring him and yet turning him into more confident human being. I was a little confused at his desire to pursue Lana, despite the possibility that she might have been the reason for two timing him towards Guido. Heck, from that very car chase, I'm starting to wonder if the whole thing was a set up to start. Nevertheless, the film's maturity, as well as the evolving development of Cruise's character make ""Risky Business"" worthy of the gamble of either liking its end result, or just plain out asking your self, ""What the f""?",Risky Business
99,SillyPuddy,Style without substance,4,25 August 2012,This movie was like one big commercial that starts out promising enough with his friends bringing an element of fun to the movie (namely Curtis Armstrong). Once the smut started the fun oddly disappeared and the movie was ironically tedious and boring to me. The only highlight of the film for me is when Joel (Cruise) drinks a whiskey and coke and gets blitzed which is a precursor and serves as a context to the famous underwear dance.

Good chemistry between Cruise and DeMornay, but I would say that almost any male of that genre would have good chemistry with Rebecca, the rest would be up to Rebecca.

Nothing could be further from the truth, and the prostitutes in this movie are the most unbelievable and unpredictable characters, and Joel ends up roughly $1000 in the hole.

The film begins with Goodson's chum Myles goading Joel into taking advantage of a parentless house with some good old-fashioned debauchery. With a snootful of the best whiskey the liquor cabinet has to offer, Joel makes a fateful decision that will change his life forever. He cues up some Old Time Rock & Roll and...dons a pair of white briefs.As anyone who has ever done laundry knows, wearing white underwear is a dangerous game. With Myles' titillating words ringing in his ears Joel throws caution to the wind and dances like a madman, daring to execute a reckless splits that jars something loose. Flinging himself back onto the couch Joel tries the jiggling-clench but to no avail as the miniature brown avalanche can hardly be contained.Trying to shake off the nightmare in jockeys, Joel dials up love and bangs his way through a Tangerine Dreamscape. The next morning when the ambitious escort (Rebecca DeMornay) discovers Joel is short on funds she sends him off to the bank to cash in a savings bond. While Goodson is out she quickly confiscates the brownmail material from a swampy hamper and scoots.When JG returns with the cash he discovers the theft and, disgusted by his own crapulence, seizes on an imaginary crystal knick-knack egg as a metaphorical version of the Cadbury he laid in his soiled drawers. Joel then stops at nothing to recover the stolen Hanes, engaging in a high speed car chase and battling wits with a wacky pimp.With all of this going on Joel's college plans come into focus as he realizes that a man of such questionable activities would not be a good fit for a respectable institution like the University of Illinois; instead he is a strong candidate to follow in the footsteps of Eliot Spitzer (class of '81) at Princeton. Young Tom Cruise grows up before our eyes (though his are shaded by the iconic Ray-Bans) and proves that wearing white briefs really is...Risky Business.8/10

In a few words, most teens are happy to be independent, desperate to be flushed with cash, and always willing to blow off steam in one way or another. Everything in this movie, from the iconic dance scene to rocking house party, really nailed how teens spend their time, making it a great film to watch if you're of that age. Not only can you see yourself in the characters, but the plot is magnificent! Very few movies (Meet the Parents comes to mind) can make you sit nervously on the edge of your seat, dreading when his parents come home, to laughing so hard that your sides hurt. Another element that I appreciate is the type of humor. Instead of making blatant, please-laugh-at-me jokes it uses more subtle comedy in which you're laughing at the situations.

Joel is an earnest, hard working high school student who wants to do the right thing, but is also possessed with desires (aren't we all) and an intense curiosity about life beyond his well manicured front lawn. To help him explore these desires are three friends who all seem to be a little more experienced and less inhibited than himself. This appears to be the source of much of Joel's problems. Joel, in a nutshell, needs to prove to himself and the world that he is more than just a """"Goodson"". Now one will note that right off the bat, ""Risky Business"" offers a little more than the usual coming of age fare. There is depth, style, good music and a carefully crafted mingling of dreamlike sequences with real life sequences. All of this serves to create the proper mood for the play out of Joel's inner conflicts. And the conflict that haunts Joel the most in the opening hour of the movie is the one between sex and success. The message: If you pursue one, you will sacrifice the other. Among those hammering home this theme are Joel's parents who fear that one day, the egg they brought into the world will hatch into a bad egg. So what happens when they leave home for a three day weekend, leaving their big house in the suburbs all to Joel? Well, keep an eye on that egg....Joel is tempted, and the empty house soon becomes a playground for the play out of his fantasies. ""Egged"" on by his friends, he invites over Lana (Rebecca de Mornay), a beautiful and classy working girl from downtown who represents everything he desires. They have sex, but soon after the fantasy begins to spiral out of control. For one, Lana has friends, and they seem intent on taking over Joel's house. All of this means that Joel's future is now in jeopardy. The egg meanwhile disappears for a time and when it reappears, it now has a crack in it...OK, so now we have arrived at the nexus of the movie's message, and it is one that many have argued about over the years. Personally, I find it abhorant that anyone's life should be ruled by a credo that says that sex and a successful working life are mutually exclusive. This seems a problem unique to Joel. Yet Joel's solution to this problem is only one of many, and really, I mean, turning your folks house into a cathouse for a few days doesn't rank up there as one of the smartest decisions that a young man could make. But hey, Joel will never be the bad egg that his parents fear, and the risk he took COULD be seen as a sign that he possesses some qualities that will serve him well later in life. Is that why his misdeed lands him a spot at Princeton, and ONLY why? I don't really have a problem with the message, having faced similar circumstances in my own life a long time ago. Anyway, through it all, Joel maintains a sort of sheepish attitude, smiling his way through much of the movie. But he also gets scared when he's REALLY in trouble (i.e when it comes to Dad's car). Otherwise, he seems way too genuinely nice to be a bad egg. And also, he falls in love with Lana, the scheming working girl and business woman who strangely becomes his mentor, both sexual AND career wise. To me, it all works in a crazy sort of way. His sexual awakening is balanced and augmented by a tutoring in how to respect the power of money. Maybe Joel can have BOTH his sex and his success in life after all...thanks to Lana...?So, but there is even more to Risky Business than that. Consider the great, hypnotic music by Tangerine Dream,and some truly memorable dreamlike sequences including one on a subway late in the movie. All of this brought emotional impact to the movie in addition to the conflict and inner tension. It was enough to almost bring one to tears. So how can Joel's parents not be happy with the outcome of all this? Joel knows his place in life, and he has securely positioned himself for future success. And that he had this little adventure only broadened his horizons a little while provided him with one heck of a real life fantasy! In conclusion, all of this secured ""Risky Business's"" place as probably the best coming of age movie to come out of Hollywood in the 1980's. And it also served as a springboard for Tom Cruise, who was justly praised for making it all happen through Joel Goodson, the earnest and appealing high schooler, who deftly transformed his sexual fantasies into a great career move. ""Risky Business"" is aptly named, and should not be missed.",Risky Business

116,JimS_8686,Memorable Original Score By Tangerine Dream,10,19 February 2011,"Risky Business is a stylish, sexy, and cool movie. The Screenplay and direction are practically flawless, the acting impressive by (at the time) a cast of complete unknowns. The Tangerine Dream soundtrack remains one of the most atmospheric and effective original scores, setting the tone of the film perfectly. Risky Business was marketed as a sexy comedy at the time of it's release in '83. In retrospect, the film is a very cynical yet clinical look at capitalism in American society. Director Paul Brickman juxtapositions satire, tense thriller and erotic romp in this one-of-a-kind film. As it is known, this is the movie which made Tom Cruise a star. It is easy to see why here, because Cruise is excellent in his portrayal of the shy yet charismatic virginesque Joel Goodsen. Joel is a young motivated individual striving for success. His buddies are all about getting laid. Joel's concern concerning planning for his future appear to be influenced by his anal-retentive parents. Joel is quite uptight next to his partying yet equally motivated buddies. Despite the fact Joel's friends are much less handsome than Joel, they have no trouble picking up women. This this makes Joel the butt of many jokes and frustrates him him to call a prostitute named Lana(Rebecca DeMornay). When Joel finally does get laid, this creates much anxiety and many problems. After he smokes some weed and screws up, it is up to Lana the streetwise call girl to clean up the mess with her expertise on how to generate income.Risky Business is made even more memorable by superb supporting turns by Curtis Armstrong, Joe Pantoliano and of course DeMornay. The Tangerine Dream score was quite effective in setting the the mood, letting the viewer know this is much more than a comedy. Risky Business should have been nominated for all the top Oscars in '83 alongside the best that studios had to offer that year. Not only Tom Cruise's stepping stone to stardom, Risky Business is one of the Best Films of the '80's Tangerine Dream's terrific original score fits the movie's atmosphere so perfectly, you wonder if the film would have been as good without it. The Oscars missed the boat here. I was surprised to learn Tangerine Dream's original score had not been nominated for Best Original Score at the 1983 Oscars. Few modern day films can lay claim to such a fitting original score. This makes Risky Business a film unlike any other. That in itself is a monumental achievement.",Risky Business

118,Foopy-2,De Mornay's character ruins the film,6,13 July 2000,"The most disappointing thing about this film is Lana, the character that Rebecca De Mornay portrays.  I have no idea why anyone would be attracted to her for any reason other than her body, because everything else about her is utterly bland and boring.  She doesn't seem to have too many thoughts in her head, all she really seems to think is that people shouldn't be judged by how much education they have--which is a fine thought, but she doesn't have many others.  She never really seems happy, or sad for that matter, mostly just indifferent throughout the entire movie, even when she's having sex with Cruise.  Except for when she's getting angry at her old boss, she doesn't seem to have any kind of personality whatsoever.  Altogether I really have no idea why Tom Cruise's character is interested in Lana beyond her usefulness as a sex object.  And because Lana is supposed to be the catalyst that causes Cruise's character transformation, it makes the whole story much less effective because I have no idea why or how such a robot could ever have such an effect on Cruise.Besides that, the movie is reasonably interesting and entertaining.  The whole ""what the f**k"" theme is fun, but the movie would've been much more fun if De Mornay's character had a lot more depth.",Risky Business

Tom Cruise with his boyish charms is impressive.Rebecca De Mornay playing Lana acts with few expressions, but say for the role of a call girl cum seductress, it suffices!!!!

133,chrisq28,"Quotable and Memorable, but Still Lacking",5,18 March 2005,"I have to admit that before I saw this film, I only knew two things about it: 1. The soundtrack was done by Tangerine Dream. 2. Tom Cruise dances around the house in his underwear to Bob Seger.It turns out that both of those things are true. ""Risky Business"" is about a kid named Joel Goodsen (""Good"" ""Son"", get it?) (played by Tom Cruise), a clean-cut high school kid who learns what it's like to say ""f--- it,"" and take risks when his parents go out of town. Joel's goals at the beginning of the movie center around getting into a good college and planning for his future. As the film progresses, however, we watch Joel make decisions that get him further and further into trouble, and we're expected to be amused as he tries to make his way out of it. The trouble that Joel gets himself into centers mainly around an attractive hooker, Lana, who is played by Rebecca de Mornay. One thing I did like about this movie was that de Mornay didn't play the ""hooker with a heart of gold"" role that has become all-too-familiar with post-Pretty Woman actresses who play hookers. Joel gets involved with Lana and her hooker friends, tries to help them out of trouble, and ends up getting getting into a tailspin of drama that includes, but is not limited to, death threats from ""Guido the killer pimp."" He eventually gets trapped into a situation where he needs lots of money, fast, and ends up compromising pretty much every value he held dear to him before his parents went out of town. Plus, he ends up with a hooker for a ""girlfriend,"" which I think is pretty gross, and I was confused as to why Joel Goodsen (or anyone besides a junkie or something) would want a girlfriend who sleeps with random dudes for money. My biggest complaint is that Joel ended up as a much worse person by the end of the movie than he did at the beginning. The film had absolutely no pathos. Pre-corruption Joel asks his friends if they're interested in doing anything in life besides making money. He mentions cornily that he wants to help his fellow man. By the end of the film, Joel's last lines are: ""My name is Joel Goodson. I deal in human fulfillment. I grossed over eight thousand dollars in one night."" The kid compromises all of his values, and seems to have learned absolutely nothing about how dirty and hopeless prostitution can be--the closest he comes to having an epiphany on his actions seems to be that ""If there were any logic to our language, trust would be a four letter word."" But shortly after saying that, he makes multiple decisions that would have one guess that he's never been there or done that before, which includes trusting a prostitute, for God's sake, over and over again, even though she screws him over each and every time. I guess if the goal of this movie was to watch high school kids get into various debaucheries with women who get paid to screw for a living, they've succeeded well. Additionally, if writer/director Paul Brickman (who went on to do pretty much nothing, by the way) meant to show that becoming a pimp can bring money, success, and entrance to the university of your choice, then he succeeded. Maybe he meant this to be a little darker than the average comedy, and maybe this movie would have found a more supportive audience in the year in which I was two years old, but I just found my sympathy for the characters and the movie as a whole went nowhere but down as the movie went on.",Risky Business
134,gene_freak,Cardboard,1,13 April 2006,"Joel is supposedly the ""good son"" - straight-laced, dull but an average guy with implied moral values that erode throughout the film.Initially, you get the impression that he needs to let loose a little, but of course things get out of hand.The overly-trusting parents are cardboard morons, his wacky friends show more personality in one line than he can muster throughout the movie - no, dancing around in your BVDs does NOT constitute a personality- and Chewbacca De Mornay's hooker character is not quite ugly or crusty enough to be remotely believable.Yeah, I realize Risky Business is trying to be over-the-top, but watching a really boring Tom Cruise character crumble into moral decay after a long sequence of idiotic events doesn't do much for me.",Risky Business

Rebecca was the high-priced call girl with a hot body and a certain edge and chill and a focus on extorting all she can from her naive new customer. Tom's impulsive late-night decision to ask Rebecca for a house call while his parents are out of town set in motion a whole lot of personal chaos, including his wrecking his father's Porsche and opting to fund its repair by letting Rebecca and her friends ply their trade among his friends in the neighborhood by opening the house up for a one-night hoe down. As the Tangerine Dream music created a smoldering timelessness to this movie, his friends intent to spend their futures making more money, one friend's lament about paying four-dollars for a cup of hot chocolate in a trendy restaurant, and Tom's entrepreneurial bent unexpectedly opening the doors of opportunity all dripped onto the canvas and gave us a glimpse of the economic reality which would be pursued by much of the generation which came of age in the 1980s.

We grew up in the Chicago suburbs where Risky Business was filmed, where such parties, while by no means common, most definitely occurred.My mother, bless her, could have supplied the line uttered by Joel's mother, because each time, as she and my father departed, Mom would say, in the same tone as Joel's mom, ""We trust you, dear.""Joel Goodson's parents weren't portrayed as stupid or naive, simply trusting. They trusted their son - with good reason - and there was only the smallest evidence that anything untoward had happened in their absence.

His actions may be seen as seedy and reprehensible, but they mirror precisely the economic values of the period - it's no coincidence that Paul Brickman made this remarkable film at a time when Reagan/Thatcher policies were leading to financial fortune for some at the expense of destitution for many. The film is a parody of 1980s business ethics - hence the title.Oh, and it's also funny (Bronson Pinchot is marvellous as Joel's geeky friend Barry), erotic (the scene on the train especially so, which is remarkable as you don't see any flesh) and with a great soundtrack (witness Joel taking his Dad's Porsche out for a spin to the pounding accompaniment of Jeff Beck's ""The Pump"", or the instant classic status accorded to the scene where Joel dances in his underpants to Bob Seger's ""Old Time Rock 'n' Roll"").",Risky Business

Joel Goodson's(played by a fresh-faced Tom Cruise)parents leave for a week at Aunt Tootie's, leaving him the family's nice suburban Chicago home all to himself. His best friend challenges him to, just once, ""say what the f#@%k,"" and take a chance on something in his life. Before Joel knows it, he is having sex with the beautiful call girl Lana on his living room stairs. After she steals his mother's precious crystal egg from the house, he chases her down and comes face to face with ""Guido the killer pimp."" Soon, Lana is hiding from Guido (played hysterically by Joe Pantoliano)in Joel's house. Joel quickly becomes unglued from his good-boy, upper middle class,future enterprisers life as he accidentally dumps his father's Porsche into Lake Michigan, falls behind on his studies, and misses his mid-terms because he has to get the aforementioned car fixed (his encounter with the school nurse is funny and his desperation after he is punished for threatening her is very palpable and is well-played by Cruise). Not to fear, though, as Joel, with Lana's guidance, becomes an ""enterpriser"" all right and begins to operate a brothel out of his house. Throw in a shaky college interview with a Princeton recruiter who comes to the brothel, er house, another encounter with Guido, and a rush to get things back to normal before the folks get home, and Joel has packed quite a bit of mayhem into one week.

I did enjoy watching the movie, but it did easily show that this was a cheap budget film and felt that many of the scenes were too short and could have added a lot more too it. Rebecca De Mornay was absolutely terrible and feel that they could have got a much better actress to play the role of what was a prostitute.I did enjoy the dancing scene which played the song (old time rock and roll) was a very catchy piece and shows that this scene has influenced comedy films to take the mickey out of it and feel that it will live long in the memory of future film generations. This starts Tom cruise on the road to super stardom and mega millions which shows that he is more of a star than any other type of acting, and it is a pity that Paul Brickman the director of this movie has not gone on to make more films.",Risky Business
145,celestivolt,Get Real,5,21 November 2006,"I saw this film when I was 29, just having become a father and not near the stage of identifying with Joel's clueless parents. The movie chronicled Joel's stepping off into shenanigans with loads of potential consequences. ***Spoiler Alert*** Things I took issue at the time included disbelief that this kid didn't get savagely beat up by pimps and thugs, that this teen-ager managed to get a fortune in car repairs made to his parent's Porche and that his parents were assumed not to discover the damage done to their car. I allowed that his getting accepted to the ivy league school after the home-brothel stunt was the movies main gag. Things I take issue with today include parents leaving their home and Porche in the care of a teen-ager in the first place. Yes, I will take mini-vacations as my kids are starting collegeyes, I will kick the grown kids out until I return and lock the house in the meantime. Get real..",Risky Business

Tom playing the innocent Joel Goodson, a kid that is on his way to making it big and getting into a good college until he meets up with the call girl Lana(Rebecca De Mornay). This movie just goes to show you how certain decisions can have different impacts on how the overall picture turns out, and Joel sees and realizes just that. The show was cast perfectly and the music adds to spice the movie up. This is a Warner Bros. classic and I think anyone in their right mind should see it.",Risky Business

149,jpl315,Still a winner after all these years,9,26 March 2005,"Joel Goodsen could easily be you at one point in life and some of him might still be a little bit you. Ditto Lana. A little bit restless. A little bit curious about the world. Gifted with a profitable rebellious streak that doesn't overwhelm you, yet helps you grow. Sobered by the real world's unwritten rules.That's ""Risky Business"" as I saw it. The movie holds a personal all-time record for number of times a movie has been seen in a theater by Yours Truly (I've also caught this flick on TV a time or two).Every time you view ""Risky Business"" -- if you've spared the time to see it more than once -- you're bound to pick up something you didn't during your previous viewing and you'll appreciate even more the many excellent touches you might've liked. That's the mark of a great movie.It doesn't have an Oscar-level touch nor did it ever seem promoted as Oscar material, so it was never surprising that ""Risky Business"" received no Oscar nominations and only two nominations for upper-echelon awards (see the awards and listings here at IMDb). That doesn't detract one iota from the movie, for seeing it is time and money well spent.With outstanding touches used by actor Tom Cruise, Goodsen's transformation from innocence to more worldly is funny, charming, and sobering. We see all these things reflected in his relationship with Lana, expertly played by Rebecca De Mornay.All of the characters in the supporting cast add to what we see in Goodsen's transformation and/or his relationship with Lana, the pricey call girl.The sight gags are pricelessly funny -- especially the sinking of Joel's dad's beloved Porsche. The music is deftly synced with the movie's many moods, most notably in Cruise's classic, hilarious shirt-and-underwear solo to the tune of Bob Seger's ""Old Time Rock and Roll."" ""Risky Business"" really captures what it was like during the time it was made for teenagers heading for college, the real world or dealing with reality's slings and arrows. The ""whaddaya wanna do with yourself"" scene with Joel and his friends in a restaurant/coffee shop kinda place is a great example, for starters. Like today, the era was very much a celebration about making a buck (the consequences be damned), winning or stepping on other people to get the most toys, and ignoring the bigger picture beyond yourself.All of which sounds pretty familiar nowadays, too, it seems.I'm not so sure Hollywood has the chutzpah to make a ""Risky Business"" nowadays. Tinsel Town doesn't seem as willing to leave fissures of vulnerability in its characters despite their triumphs the way ""Risky Business"" does. Today's Hollywood might very well sell out Joel and Lana in some over-the-top, powder-puff way rather than giving us a feeling of ""Geez, that used to be me and some of it still is.""You're likely to find ""Risky Business"" characters' feelings and the movie's viewpoint provide a unique perspective on what was then (if you survived the early 1980s with some of your sanity intact) and what's happening in the world now (sanity optional). And you'll still get a darn good, well-timed laugh.",Risky Business

Excellent movie providing an accurate, contemporary image of the eighties. Well to do family all shook up by low class intruders of various kinds. Underrated (II): the importance of the exhilarating music for this movie, providing a perfect match - between dreamy Techno (Tangerine Dream) and ""that old time rock 'n roll"" (Seger, The Police, Phil Collins, Muddy Waters, Bruce Springsteen). The relationship with De Mornay is amazingly vibrant - the dialogue sharp and cheerful. Everlasting oneliners everywhere.

In any event, my daughter and her friend were watching ""The Girl Next Door"" and I spent the whole movie thinking that this was very derivative and my daughter and her friend had never even heard of ""Risky Business,"" so we watched it. My daughter really liked the movie and agreed that her movie was a pale imitation (though it was cute). I think a lot of teen movies are now just trying to shock as opposed to telling an interesting and intricate story. This movie made Tom Cruise (with whom I very annoyed given his treatment of Nicole and his display on the Today Show - medication can help a chemical imbalance), but the movie is a classic. I loved it when I first saw it as a young adult (25) and I still think it is one of the best teen movies ever made.",Risky Business

161,moquist,Degrading example of consequence-free irresponsibility,1,14 July 2002,"I would recommend against seeing this film, so I don't feel bad about including spoilers in this review.  But, just so you're aware... SPOILER ALERT!! I can enjoy ""Pulp Fiction"" as art.  I appreciate ""A Clockwork Orange"", which has far more explicit nudity, _and_ violence, than this film.  I appreciate those films because they mean something; the artists who created them were aiming toward something more significant than ""feel-good"" light comedy. My best guess is that this film wanted to explore teen angst.  If that was its goal, however, it failed, as the perspective it gives us is hopelessly lopsided and fails to engage sufficiently (even as parody or contrast) with reality. The overall message seems to be ""be willing to cut loose once in a while"". That's a fine message, when ""cut loose"" is defined well.  This film portrays ""cutting loose"" as utter irresponsibility that is blind to consequences. (Although Joel thinks he won't get into Princeton (a bad consequence of his actions), he does (an unreasonable, good consequence).  So what is the film really saying here?)  That is hardly a worthy message.I would recommend either ""The Breakfast Club"" or ""Dirty Dancing"" over this film, as each of them 1) confronts the same/similar issues as ""Risky Business"", without so many of the mindless, cliched, ""feel-goodisms"", and 2) significantly explores something relevant to human life in such a way as to arrive at some sort of conclusion. If you want to watch this film just to see a young Tom Cruise...well, consider yourself warned.  There are many other, better movies on which you can spend your time.",Risky Business

Following his friend's advice, he decides to seize the moment; so one night he calls Lana (Rebecca De Mornay), a prostitute, and they spend the night together. But in the morning, things get out of hand when he doesn't have enough money to pay Lana, and specially later when he gets his father's Porche drowned. It was then that he gets in to a risky business Although 'Risky Business' is basically a teen movie, there are two things in this movie that separate it from other similar movies: the chemistry between Tom Cruise and Rebecca De Mornay and its perfect score.While the movie has an overall interesting direction and the story & acting are good, it is the soundtrack that makes 'Risky Business' superior to other movies in its genre. The one scene that I like most is when Joel & Lana are in the train, toward the end of the movie and it plays 'In the Air Tonight'. It is a beautiful song and it matches the scene so perfectly that even after multiple viewing it still has an impact on you.'Risky Business' is an overall good movie with some truly funny moments, a solid performance by Tom Cruise, and an amazing score.

A few others include Breakfast Club and Ferris Bueller's Day Off. There was something about the way those films were shot with grainy film that made it Chicago look almost surreal. Getting back to Risky Business, this teenage sex comedy is far superior to what we see today, such as American Pie and Road Trip. The film is so smart in the way it portrays teenage angst.

Period.,10,3 February 2005,"I just wanted to chime in on what I believe is an underrated masterpiece of The Eighties... recently ""homaged"" by the less-than-stellar ""Girl Next Door."" Tom Cruise as yup-and-comer Joel Goodson in Paul Brickman's finest film, turns in a star-making performance as he meanders through the trials and tribulations of puberty, desires for success as an adult, and an ever-changing notion of what it is to be faithful to one's own ideals as they are assaulted by the system we call ""Capitalism."" Whew! Did ya get all that? Risky Business tells the story of do-gooder Joel (hence the last name 'Goodson', get it?) and how he spends time alone in his parents home while they are away on vacation. Without spoiling the film (god forbid), it's alright to say that Joel becomes a capitalist of his own after losing his virginity to prostitute Rebecca DeMornay (a time capsule installment for this beauty!) and opens a brothel in his home...The antagonist, played by Jimmy ""The Pants"" Pantoliano, provides great antagonism as Guido, ""the killer pimp."" I don't want to say what the outcome of the film is, but Joel, pushed and pulled by his parents, his best friend, Guido, a Princeton College scout and others, is you, me and all of us males in between at the precious and precocious age of 16. It's a magic gem of a film with a lot on it's mind, most of it fully realized by Brickman, who should step up to bat more often... Where are you Paul Brickman? where's your next film??

167,monsieurbibo54,Ferris Bueller meets existentialism,10,20 September 2008,"""Risky Business"" is, in my opinion, along the same lines as ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"", only deeper, more emotional, and very existential. Just as the theme of Ferris Bueller was that life might pass you buy if you don't stop to smell the roses, the theme of Risky Business is, as stated by the dude from Revenge of the Nerds, ""sometimes you just have to say 'What the f*%#!'."" This film goes deeper, however, as it enters the realm of strong sexual longings that anyone of the late teens/early 20s knows all too well, as well as the pressures of parents and of society to ""succeed"": get into a good college, impress ""the man"", make your parents dreams a reality, and wear a white collar for the rest of your life. ""Risky Business"" asks: is it really worth it to sacrifice the experience of life (in this case, the surge of excitement, bittersweet memories, and longing of the late teens/early 20s) just to ""be the best you can be""? The haunting soundtrack by Tangerine Dream, one of my favorite bands, amplifies the bittersweet, reminiscent atmosphere excellently, especially 'Love on a Real Train', which accompanies one of the most haunting and bittersweet scenes in the film and is arguably the most well-known Tangerine Dream track ever, and for good reason.Like 'The Breakfast Club', this is one of the 80s teen coming-of-age flicks which retains its distinct 80s flavor and relevance to the era as well as being utterly timeless.

Joel is a worrier, with a fixation on getting into Princton. He may have had a party while his parents were gone (or not), & the Princeton rep may have showed up while his friends were there (or not). Lana is probably real, a girl from a lower socio-economic class; Guido might have been her boyfriend, or just Joel's paranoid creation.

169,grilledcheese69,A film rarely equaled before or since,10,16 August 2005,"This is the apex of film-making in the early 80s. Tom Cruise's star turn as Joel in a high class Chicago neighborhood has easily stood the test of time. The characters in this film are far more complex upon further review. Cruise's high schooler, Joel, can be seen as a naive kid shown the ways of the world by the street smart Lona (rebecca Dimorna, in easily her best role). However, in scenes that build character, you can tell he holds her in a sort of contempt, a fairly judgmental position. At the same time, Lona is insecure enough with her life that she jumps on the opportunity to find cracks in Joel's seemingly perfect life. In fact, Joel, as evident through his fantasies in the beginning, is an insecure high school kid, just another one who needs to be in a high speed chase with a pimp to pull out the confidence he needs. This movie has comedy supplied by Booger from Revenge of the nerds (in fact an amazing entourage of accomplished supporting actors) and a wonderful, almost transcendent, score by Tangerine Dream. There are a number of memorable, no classic scenes, many of them better than the culturally famous scene of Cruise rocking out to Bob Seger in his tighty whities. While it reminisces of Hoffman in the graduate at times, I can say honestly that this is a far superior movie in almost every way, with all respect due to that truly great film.

There are some funny bits, but they are too few and far between to make it worth the effort to watch. The action (and I use that term loosely) takes too long to materialize, and the ending is very unsatisfying.

Risky Business' famous singing scenes and the actions and decisions that Joel Goodson undertakes (which i won't mention for fear of spoilers), can be relatable to any high school students ( particularly male in some scenes but maybe i'm being too assumptive). 
The performance of Cruise was excellent and very natural in his character. Like all good performances, you forget that the actor is acting. Also very interesting to see him playing a young student in the 1980's which totally contrasts to the action blockbuster movie making actor we depict him as nowadays. As well as that i must mention the beautiful Rebecca De Mornay who shines also in Risky Business. Her and Cruise's love story is not your typical run of the mill love story and their on-screen chemistry is believable and exciting to watch. I would advocate this film to anyone to watch. Its interest, thought provoking and certain scenes really broadened my mind. Its excellent.",Risky Business
