0,TheLittleSongbird,Stunning slice of life,10,2 January 2019,"Have a lot of admiration for Alfonso Cuaron as a director. Also really like to love almost all of his films (having been mixed on 'Great Expectations'), though 'Gravity' is one of those more appreciate than love divisive films that also boasted some of the best cinematography and direction of that year. Of his previous films am especially fond of 'Children of Men' and 'A Little Princess' (the film that introduced me to his work and is a personal favourite) in their own way for different reasons.Was really excited in seeing 'Roma', with talks of it being one of the highlights of 2018, one of Cuaron's best films and trusted friends saying how emotional it was and especially praising the cinematography, direction and sound mixing. Nothing was going to stop me from seeing 'Roma' with the praise being as high as that, despite the (from personal opinion) rather condescending detractors being quite vocal, including making ignorant and off-base paid reviews allegations that says more about themselves than it says those they're criticising. After seeing 'Roma', and this is a genuine opinion here, am going to join those praising the film. Praise that 'Roma' deserves every ounce of and more. One of my favourite films of 2018 definitely, and it has been a variable year so that is saying quite a bit, and quite possibly Cuaron's best film.'Roma', being a semi-autobiographical film, is Cuaron at his most personal, both the writing and the direction. One of the main reasons why 'Roma' did such a lot for me was the emotion, with such brutal thought-provoking realism and poignant, without being over-sentimental, pathos it was the film that connected with me the most emotionally. It also was him at his most thought-provoking and there was no sugar-coating, in fact what was also admirable was the not holding anything back pulls no punches approach. It depicted real life situations and struggles and in a way that was relatable and hard not to get nostalgic or moved over.The pacing has been criticised for being slow, it is deliberate but personally was caught up in the emotion and the compelling realism of the very personal story-telling to care. Plus since when has a film being slow ever always being a bad thing? It only is a problem when there's no reason to be and with the subject to me it came over that the deliberate pace for 'Roma' was not an accidental choice. Sure, finding its rhythm is not immediate but it is very rewarding when stuck with (rather than stopping watching after a ridiculously short period of time and then bragging about doing it). The script is sincere and thoughtful, not written or delivered heavy-handedly.Now we get onto what is especially great about 'Roma'. It is a visually stunning film, have not seen cinematography this amazing, varied or clever in a long time and it complements the evocative setting and the strikingly effortless and atmospheric lighting so brilliantly one is truly immersed. Another major star is Cuaron's direction, showing a visual master of his craft and a person clearly passionate and in love with the story he's telling. Both wholly deserving of major awards attention. Same with the sound-mixing which has all three of the qualities that the cinematography has been described has, so appropriate to the mood and enhances it in a way that few other films this year have done so well. As well as the astonishing and very moving breakthrough lead performance from Yalitza Aparicio, as the most compellingly real and rootable character in a film full of them and strong performances.In conclusion, absolutely loved it. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Roma
1,Leofwine_draca,Didn't see the fuss,5,27 February 2019,"ROMA is a 'snapshot of life' style movie from director Alfonso Cuaron, one which has received plenty of acclaim recently as well as the award for best foreign language film at the Oscars. Still, what do they know? For me, ROMA is a typical kind of movie, not particularly powerful or hard-hitting, and flawed to say the least. Cuaron has done much better with the likes of CHILDREN OF MEN and even HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN. The film follows an ordinary poor family and their nanny as they go through a period of social upheaval in Mexico in the 1960s and 1970s. Naturalistic performances from an unknown cast count towards it, but the story is episodic and stretched out and the decision to shoot in black and white robs it of vitality. It's better than GRAVITY, but that's not saying much.",Roma
2,SnoopyStyle,observational,7,7 June 2019,"Cleo Gutiérrez is one of two maids working for an affluent family in Mexico City. There is marital difficulties as the husband Antonio leaves for Quebec City. Cleo's boyfriend disappears after she tells him about her pregnancy.The black and white cinematography is terrific. The movie starts looking good but horribly slow. It's the slowest of art house movies. It borders on pretentious. Then Cleo starts to have more to do than simply mop the floor. It's interesting to have a non-actor be the lead but it's also limiting. The movie builds up its story until an epic street battle. I like almost everything about that sequence except holding the last scene on that couple in the streets. The power of seeing the horror indirectly is completely obliterated by pointing the camera at the specific aftermath. There is also the drowning scene. It's too obvious. Again, filmmaker Alfonso Cuarón is pushing the point too hard. It's in your face and he can do better. There is also something awkward about being that obvious when the shooting style is so observational. They are minor bumps in an otherwise compelling ride.",Roma
3,Hitchcoc,"Touching, Beautiful Film with a Real Edge",10,16 March 2019,"This broad, award winning film, brings a culture that few of us are aware of, down to the basics. There are dream and hope. There is a subtlety here that has been put there by a filmmaker that sees all sides and lets the audience grapple with the issues. There is beauty and pain, but it is melded masterfully.",Roma
4,Prismark10,This year's critical darling,5,23 January 2019,"Roma is a personal film from Alfonso Cuaron. It certainly seems to hark back to his childhood as it is set in Mexico of 1970.Shot in black and white, the way the shots were composed certainly reminded me of European cinemas of the 1950s and 1960s. It could had been made by Fellini or Clouzot.It tells the story of two women across the class divide. Cleo is a young maid working for a middle class family. She is treated well and she has a boyfriend, Fermin who loves his martial arts. When Cleo falls pregnant Firmin abandons her. When Cleo sees Firmin again in the backdrop of violence, the shock pushes her to labour.Sofía a biochemist who teaches and Antonio, a doctor are Cleo's employers. They have four children as well as Sofía's mother living with them.However the household is going to split. Antonio goes for long business trips, it signifies that he has a mistress and this time he has no plans to return.Both Cleo and Sofía are abandoned by their men.Roma is beautiful to look at. Cuaron also makes a reference to his award winning Gravity by a showing a scene from the 1969 film, Marooned.However there is very little story here, it does feel flat and insipid. We know very little about the characters and the events depicted. It is like a slice of Maria's life. It left me unfulfilled.",Roma
5,claudio_carvalho,The Daily Life of a Maid in the 70´s in Mexico,6,22 February 2019,"The boring daily life of a maid in the 70´s in Mexico is the storyline of ""Roma"". The screenplay follows the life of Cleo, the maid of an upper middle-class family. This is a typical film for professional critics and viewers from the First World. For a Third World viewer, the situations shown in ""Roma"" happen everywhere and every time and are part of the dailylife. The beautiful black-and-white cinematography and the excellent camerawork are the great parts of this average and overrated film. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Roma""",Roma
6,kosmasp,Family,8,3 July 2019,"Life of a maid - I never had a maid or nanny. But we all know about women (mostly) who do this type of work. It can be because the parents are too busy (work related mostly) or because they just want more free time for themselves. Now if you attach an attribute to that, you are the one judging, I'm simply stating what most of us know anyway.Try to be open minded, although even if you aren't the movie slowly takes over. It's quite slowly paced, but that is how it gets to you. It's mundane and it feels like you are invading someone elses privacy. But instead you just get to be another member of the family/group. Someone who is just there to observe. And while you may know where this is heading, the planting/seeding and later harvesting of clues and happenings (car parking for example) is quite something. To say it is well made, would be an understatement, but it also is able to touch you. If you let it that is of course. Good movie/drama",Roma
7,Sleepin_Dragon,"Bewildered, but impressed by the visuals.",5,7 February 2021,"A colleague of mine, who's an art student brought in the dvd and insisted I would love it.If I'm honest, I couldn't follow it, there's a story here, but I think I'd need to watch it again to fully understand what was going on, but for me, the pacing was so slow, I really couldn't sit through it again.On the plus side, it's beautiful, I'm an amateur film lover, and in no real position to comment, but the filming, camera work, and direction are jaw dropping, if you're into art house, you will have a real appreciation for this.It's not my cup of tea, for me it's style over substance, but I can see why there would be an appeal. 5/10.",Roma
8,classicsoncall,"""The only miracle resides in your own will.""",7,29 December 2018,"I've found Netflix original movies to be a hit or miss affair, mostly miss. This one comes somewhere in between. As I write this, ""Roma"" is getting all kinds of Golden Globe and Oscar buzz, but I have to wonder if that has more to do with the current state of pop culture and #MeToo sensationalism as opposed to the story it tells. Because the story itself is somewhat rather mundane, a slice of life look at a Mexican housemaid and her employer who are the principal characters. Both are beset by troubles inflicted by their partners, the homeowner Sofia (Marina de Tavira), who's husband has left her, and Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio), the domestic who's almost part of the family but always knows her place in it's hierarchy.To be fair, there are some uniquely creative elements in the story that drew my attention, like the Mexican family's penchant for having the heads of their deceased dogs mounted and hung on a wall, and a guy made up to look like Swamp Thing in a couple of scenes. The one with the naked martial artist Fermin (Jorge Antonio Guerrero) seemed to be thrown into the story for it's voyeuristic possibilities; it didn't take much from there to determine that Cleo's choice of boyfriend would turn into a creep who would cause her much suffering.There was really only one time in the movie when something of a momentous nature occurred, and that was during the first twenty minutes of the last half hour of the story. The beach scene had this viewer on tenterhooks trying to determine what the outcome would be with the two young children who ventured too far out into the ocean. At that point, the film could have gone for unrelenting pathos or a miraculous save that would put Cleo's life in context of a bigger picture than the day to day conditions she had to endure. The story opted for a life affirming message that allowed Cleo to transcend her mundane existence, and that was a good feeling.I wouldn't go so far to say that this was a bad picture or that I wouldn't recommend it, but it does require a certain amount of patience to sit through. It's held together by some humorous spots that worked when required, my favorite one was when Fermin's friend Ramon (José Manuel Guerrero Mendoza) reluctantly agreed to bring Cleo to where her boyfriend was training. Realizing he was going out in public, he stated, ""Hold on, let me put on some pants"".",Roma
9,lee_eisenberg,being a maid in an uncertain world,10,8 January 2019,"Alfonso Cuarón's ""Roma"" is about a maid working for a middle class family in Mexico City in 1970-71, but overall focuses on a couple of things. The obvious point is Mexico's social hierarchy. The protagonist is Mixtec, while her employers are white. One scene pans across the rooftops, showing the maids hanging people's clothes. Equally important is the political situation in Mexico at the time. Industrialization in the 1950s and 1960s had driven millions of rural people into the capital, where they had to live in slums. The years of Cuarón's childhood were marked by the army's massacre of protesters in Tlatelolco right before the Olympics started, and then by the Corpus Christi Massacre (which the movie depicts). The depiction of the father abandoning the family brings to mind Cuarón's expose of Mexico's ruling class in ""Y Tu Mamá También"" (which also showed the country's hierarchy).On top of this, the city itself is just as much a character as any of the cast members. The locales - whether the upscale neighborhood where the family lives, or the slum from whence the maid comes - and the various sounds mark almost every scene in the movie. Indeed, much of the movie is minimalist, emphasizing the action. It all adds up to another fine piece of work from one of Mexico's three great directors of the past thirty years. I recommend it.",Roma
10,jboothmillard,Roma,8,24 February 2019,"Along with The Favourite, this was the most nominated movie at the Academy Awards, both films receiving ten nominations, it was predicted to do the best during Awards Season, and it was available to watch on Netflix, so there was no way I could miss this Mexican film, from Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning director Alfonso Cuarón (A Little Princess, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Children of Men, Gravity). Cleodegaria ""Cleo"" Gutiérrez (Oscar nominated Yalitza Aparicio) is an indigenous live-in maid in a middle-class household in the Colonia Roma neighborhood of Mexico City. Living in the house with her are the family: matriarch Sofía (Oscar nominated Marina de Tavira), her husband Antonio (Fernando Grediaga), grandmother Teresa (Verónica García), their four young children, and Adela (Nancy García García), another maid. Antonio is a doctor, he leaves for a conference in Quebec, it becomes clear that Sofía and Antonio's marriage is strained. Antonio returns briefly, but leaves again, saying he is going to Quebec for a few weeks. Cleo and Adela go out to the cinema with their boyfriends, Fermín (Jorge Antonio Guerrero) and Ramón (José Manuel Guerrero Mendoza), but Cleo and Fermín decide to rent a room instead. Later, at the cinema, Cleo tells Fermín that she thinks she is pregnant, as the film are seeing is about to end, he leaves saying he needs the bathroom. But he does not return and is nowhere to be found, Sofia shares her concern, and takes her to the hospital where Antonio works, a doctor confirms her pregnancy. Sofía takes Cleo, Adela, and her children to a family friend's place for the New Year holiday. Landowners and the workers mention recent tensions over land in the area, and during the celebrations, a fire erupts in the forest. Everyone helps extinguish it while a man counts down the remaining seconds of 1970 before singing a Norwegian lullaby. Back in the city, Cleo accompanies the children and their grandmother to the cinema to watch a movie. They see Antonio walking out with a young woman, Sofía tries to conceal this from the children, but her second son eavesdrops and learns about it, she tells him not to reveal it his siblings. Through Adela's boyfriend, Cleo finds Fermín at an outdoor martial-arts class, she also attends. Fermín refuses to acknowledge that the baby is his and threatens to beat Cleo and the unborn child if they try to find him again. With the baby almost due, Teresa takes Cleo to buy a crib. On the way, students are gathering to protest, this turns deadly when police commence clubbing, while bands of roving youths randomly shoot at protesters. When a wounded man and a woman run into the store trying to hide, several youths find the man and shoot him dead, another gunman, who points a gun at Cleo, turns out to be Fermín; he glares at her momentarily before running off. Cleo's water breaks, she, Teresa, and their driver try to get to the hospital but are stuck in traffic amid the violent protests. Antonio comes by to reassure Cleo before she reaches the delivery room but makes an excuse to avoid staying. Hearing no heartbeat in Cleo's womb, the doctors take her into surgery, where they deliver a stillborn girl, there are multiple failed attempts to resuscitate the baby. Sofía has a drunken failed attempt to park the family car in the car garage, she buys a narrower car, but plans to take the family on a final trip in the old car to the beaches at Tuxpan. Cleo is brought along as well, Sofía wants to help her cope with her loss. Sofía tells the children that she and their father are separated, and that the holiday was so their father can collect his belongings from their home. At the beach, two of the children are almost carried off by a strong current, despite not knowing how to swim, Cleo wades in to save them. As Sofía and the children affirm their love for Cleo for such selfless devotion, she breaks down and reveals that she had not wanted her baby to be born, they all hug her on the sand. They return home to Roma to find the house reorganised. Cleo prepares a load of washing, telling Adela they have a lot to talk about. Cleo climbs ladders to the rooftop with the clothes to wash before the credits roll. Also starring Diego Cortina Autrey as Toño, Carlos Peralta as Paco, Marco Graf as Pepe, Daniela Demesa as Sofi and Latin Lover as Profesor Zovek. This is definitely an art-house approach to filmmaking from Cuarón, telling a poignant semi-autobiographical story in black-and-white colour, it is a compelling of a marriage falling apart and a live-in maid standing at the heart of the family, the 1970s setting all looks and feels authentic, the camerawork with slow tracking, widescreen shots and striking lighting is effortless but effective, it is a simple, fairly quiet, but most enthralling drama. It won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year and Best Cinematography, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Original Screenplay for Alfonso Cuarón, Best Production Design, Best Sound Editing and Best Sound Mixing, it won the BAFTA for Best Film, Best Film Not in the English Language and Best Cinematography, and it was nominated for Best Original Screenplay, Best Editing and Best Production Design, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Foreign Language, and it was nominated for Best Screenplay. Very good!",Roma
11,CinemaSerf,A work of cinematic art...,7,26 December 2020,"I have to say that I found the look of this film quite breathtaking - Cuarón's beautifully shot depiction of life in Mexico City in the early 70's is positively laced - almost like a collage of photographs - with stylish imagery. The fact that it is entirely shot in black and white adds richness too. Though set in pretty turbulent times, the story, however is really nothing to write home about. ""Cleo"" (Yalitza Aparicio) provides an authentic performance as the maid for a doctor and his upper-middle class family. She has a special bond with his wife ""Sophia"" ((Marina de Tavira) and we follow their rather intimate and caring relationship that defies the glaring gap in their social classes. There is certainly plenty going on, but as with normal life these things progress slowly - if at all - and, unfortunately, that rendered this a bit of long watch with little development with either plot nor character - after a while I became a bit immune to the cinematography and started to want something a bit more substantial as it ends pretty much as it began... This is a timeless piece of cinema, no doubt - but is it great? Hmmm...!",Roma
12,grantss,"It's the journey, not the destination",8,16 December 2018,"Mexico City, 1970. An upper-middle-class family live a reasonably average, mundane existence. Their maid, Cleo, is an observer to their domestic existence but she has a life of her own. This is her story.Good drama, directed by Alfonso Cuarón (Gravity, Children of Men, Y tu mamá también). Slow-burning yet very engaging. You get sucked in by Cleo's story and feel with her as her life takes its twists and turns.While it's a great drama, there's some quite funny moments too, and a tongue-in-cheek nod by Cuarón to his own film, Gravity.Superb cinematography, with some shots that could be straight out of a photography exhibit.Not particularly powerful or profound though. I kept waiting for the plot to lead to something that tied everything together, a single event that made all the (what appeared to be) build-up worth while. There is an event towards the end that does give meaning to some of what came before but things then quickly go back to the Act 1-like feel.This all said, this movie is not about providing great profundity or a dramatic conclusion. It's about life and its journey, and what an engaging journey it is.",Roma
13,evanston_dad,Already Want to See It Again,9,21 December 2018,"I already want to see ""Roma"" again.It took me a good while to settle into the rhythms of Alfonso Cuaron's critically acclaimed new film, and by the time I did I wanted to go back and start it over to see what I might have missed. A lot comes at the viewer in ""Roma,"" and it's hard to take it all in on a first viewing. No...that's the wrong way to put it. Nothing comes at you -- you have to go after it. That's what makes ""Roma"" unique. Cuaron crams his frame in any given scene with tons of movement and sound, but he shoots almost everything in medium and long shots and chooses to pan his camera rather than insert a lot of edits. The result is you have to decide what you want to look at, and while the main protagonist is in virtually every scene, she's not always necessarily the focal point.That protagonist, by the way, is Cleo, maid to a wealthy family and played in a quiet and quietly devastating performance by Yalitza Aparicio. ""Roma"" is an episodic assemblage of scenes that shows what life is like for Cleo, without big showy emotional moments or much editorializing. She's treated fairly well by the family she works for, but make no mistake -- they rarely let her forget she's their employee. The film is a lot about privilege. The family treats Cleo as one of their own when they feel like it or when it's convenient to, but don't when it's not. She's part of their most intimate moments and they her's, but she'll never really be one of them. She has much to take care of, but nothing of her own to really care for. And there's a big wide world out there, the movie makes clear, that will never include people like Cleo.For a while I was a little disappointed that I wasn't feeling ""Roma"" as much as I wanted to and as much as rapturous reviews led me to believe I would. I was engaged by it, but I didn't feel heavily involved emotionally. But then pretty far into the movie something happens to Cleo, and in that moment I realized how invested I was in how things turned out for her. ""Roma"" sneaks up on you in that way.Grade: A",Roma
14,ferguson-6,Cuaron's personal gem,8,23 December 2018,"Greetings again from the darkness. It is possible for a filmmaker to be ""too close"" to the material when undertaking a story that is somewhat autobiographical. It's also possible, in that situation, for them to catch lightning in a bottle and magic on the screen - and that's exactly what writer/director Alfonso Cuaron has achieved with this look back at his childhood home life. In his follow-up to GRAVITY, for which he won the Best Director Oscar, Mr. Cuaron has dedicated the film to Libo, his family maid/nanny during his youth in Mexico City.Balancing artistry and everyday humanity like few other films, it takes us inside the home of a well-off family: Antonio (Fernando Gredigaga), the father-husband-doctor; Sofia (Marina de Tavira, the only experienced actor in the main cast), the mother-wife; Teresa (Veronica Garcia), the grandmother; the four kids; and two live-in maids, Adela (Nancy Garcia Garcia) and Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio). There is no separating the human emotions from the near-poetic art form of Cuaron's movie. It is unusually quiet, filmed mostly at midrange, and with no musical score. Yet, in the stillness and quiet, so much is happening.The focus here is on Cleo. We hear many times how she is considered part of the family. Of course, she (and we) are reminded that's only true to a certain extent as she is admonished for not cleaning up after the family dog or 'wasting' electricity in her living quarters by using the light in her tiny living quarters at night. First time actress Yalitza Aparicio brings a realism and accessibility to the role as the quiet, perpetually-in-motion maid/caregiver/nanny and she is mesmerizing to watch. Her duties include keeping the house clean, cooking meals, getting the kids up in the morning, getting the kids to/from school, and putting the kids to bed at night. What little scraps of time she has for a personal life are spent going on a date with the cousin of Adela's boyfriend. Fermin (Jorge Antonio Guerrero) is a martial arts fanatic and just prior to their intimacy, he demonstrates his skills to her with a shower rod and literally nothing else.When Antonio and Sofia announce to the kids that dad will be attending a conference in Quebec ""for a few weeks"", we as viewers understand what this means, even though the kids don't. Spending time with his mistress means Sofia and Grandma Teresa must manage the house ... but of course, as always, the bulk of the burden falls to Cleo. When Cleo finds out she's pregnant, Fermin dumps her - leaving both Cleo and Sofia as abandoned by men. It's fascinating to watch this unfold, and contrast how the two women react and cope. The dialogue is secondary to the situations in the film, but there is a great line of dialogue after the men leave: ""We women are always alone.""From a cinematic aspect, Cuaron's film is a delight to watch - reminding at times of the classic Italian and French films of years past. Since his first film in 1995, Cuaron has frequently collaborated with (3 time Oscar winning) cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, but this time Cuaron wears multiple hats as writer/director/cinematographer/co-editor/producer. This is his movie - and his most personal one - from top to bottom. Working closely over the years with Lubezki has influenced Cuaron's camera work ... it's stunning. He uses wide, initially static shots with slow pans - just the way we see in real life. And just like in real life, what he shows us is sometimes mundane and at other times various degrees of emotional. The remarkable opening credit scene could be quickly described as Cleo mopping the dog mess from the garage floor. But of course there is much more. We also see the reflection of planes flying overhead and hear only the sounds of everyday life. It sets the stage for the entire film.This is 1970-71 Mexico City, so in addition to Cleo getting the kids to and from school, the street riots - some quite violent - play a role, as does the incessant sound of dogs barking in the background. Cleo's trip to the delivery room is filmed with real doctors and nurses, while a later trip to the beach offers yet another gut punch ... and both sequences maintain the overall feel of authenticity. Lest you think this is just another ""small scale"" indie, Cuaron goes big a few times - the street riot, a mass martial arts training session, and the beach trip. His film is a story of class and family, making it more than just a thing of celluloid beauty. It also brilliantly captures the essence of life's emotions: the ""bad"" with two men who ignore their responsibilities, the ""normal"" with kids being kids, and the ""good"" with seeing Cleo become such a vital and beloved part of the family.",Roma
15,phd_travel,Different and absorbing,8,23 January 2019,"Set in the 1970s in Mexico City, this movie follows a maid in a middle class family. Two major events affect the family. The father leaves and the maid gets knocked up. There are some surprises here. One of the nice things in this movie is the affection show to Cleo by the family. The villains here are the men both rich and poor. The baby daddy is a violent scumbag and the father of the family is an irresponsible whipped douche bag. The filming is absorbing - and explicit. The matter of fact was things are shown is refreshing. The tragic parts are better because of it - not sentimental, just realistic.One fault is that I wish it wasn't made in black and white - it's hard to sense some things when it's not in color.Best Picture? Not sure. Best actress? she's very believable but don't know if there was that much acting involved - it was more the story that 's good.",Roma
16,blanbrn,"Well done and good reflection on life, connection, attachment, love, loss, sorrow, and change.",9,20 December 2018,"I must say that the latest work from director Alfonso Cuaron called ""Roma"" is well done as the film is based on his own experiences and memories growing up in Mexico City as a kid. The film is touching and heartfelt as it's common themes that involve life like connection, change, attachment, sorrow, loss, and love is something everyone can relate to. The film done in black and white and reading the subtitles will hold your viewing interest along with the story. Set in the early to mid 1970's in Mexico City it's a wide open look at the life of a middle class family who struggle with everyday things and eventually a broken home will come out of these struggles, however the wild card and backbone that holds the family together is the young maid Cleo(in a strong performance from Yalitza Aparicio). Along the way Cleo too is faced with her own problems of loss and her life suffers sorrow and change. Still thru all of the storms that both the family and Cleo weather at the end a bond of love, connection, and attachment, is never broken. Overall this movie makes you appreciate family, and love proving that connection and attachment shines thru even when change, loss, and sorrow happens.",Roma
17,thesar-2,Simply Gorgeous,9,10 February 2019,"Not sure I'm qualified to review this as this took me three full weekends to finally complete it.While an overall great film, the best part of this experience was how beautiful it is. If this wins Best Picture, great. Director, Actress, wonderful. But, it's a full-on SIN if this doesn't win for Best Cinematography.I loved this movie. It felt real, human and true. This is an absolute love-letter to a youth. But above all, again, and I'll probably say it again: it's simply stunning.The movie is set in 1970-1 during a political battle, but let's forget all that. It's really about a housekeeper that holds a broken family together when tragedy hits time and again. True tears were shed when the film wraps and with good reason.This movie is for true cinema lovers. It's so breathtaking, so intimate, you'll be hard-pressed to replicate the vision.***Final thoughts: Thanks to my friend, Kevin of Fat Guys at the Movies fame for finally explaining why ""graphic nudity"" always refers to a man's junk. It's much harder to show a woman's genitalia, so to speak.",Roma
18,cherold,distanced but pretty,7,23 April 2019,"Roma is a lot like spying on the neighbors through binoculars. You see what goes on, but you have little sense of the inner lives of the characters.The movie follows a young maid through her life caring for a somewhat dysfunctional family. We see her clean, chat with her co-workers, date, and encounter misfortune, but we never really know who she is. The movie reminded me a little of how I saw the world as a child, with the lives of those around me somewhat opaque. The difference is that while I didn't see the world clearly, I had the focal point of me, while this movie is never quite about anything.This distanced approach words best in a stunning, disorientating hospital scene, but in spite of some good moments, like the appearance of an eccentric martial arts teacher, the film generally left me dissatisfied.The movie is most notable for its stunning black and white cinematography. The opening scene, which is nothing but water on tiled stones, is truly remarkable.I thought this movie didn't deserve the wild critical acclaim and awards it received, although my girlfriend was far more enthusiastic. I would say it was worth watching but if you don't watch it, no great loss.",Roma
19,ElMaruecan82,"A slice of Life... with a major ""L""...",9,15 December 2018,"The story of Cleo and her 'family' might hit a sensitive chord for many viewers who grew up not just in Mexico but in any Third-World country, maybe not just in the 70s but probably the 80s or early 90s.By no means am I depriving the story from its cultural core but it was Roger Ebert who said: ""The more specific a film is, the more universal, because the more it understands individual characters, the more it applies to everyone."" Still, it's not just about the characters, I could relate to the context as well on a superficial but still deeply personal level.Coming from a middle-class family of Morocco, we also had these girls who came from poorer backgrounds (generally rural areas) and whose treatment would look a bit like slavery from a European/""Western"" standpoint. The term wouldn't be appropriate though as they were paid, certainly not mistreated and in most cases were considered like members of the family. Not all the ladies of the house treated them with respect but they were often loved by the kids as sister-figures or even surrogate mothers. I was practically raised by the same 'dada' from the age of 4, she dressed me, woke me up, cleaned me till I was 8 (my daughter does it alone since she's 3) and well, she was part of my life and I miss her a lot.I could relate to the story of Cleo and I was glad that the film didn't take the predictable ""clash of the classes"" path: having her fired, being rejected or ending as a prostitute in some brothel of Mexico City... Cuaron is above these tiresome archetypes and his intention is clearly to take the opportunity of a nostalgic voyage through his childhood to show people with a strong capability of caring and being empathetic regardless of their origins or social backgrounds. And Cleo, played with mesmerizing naturalness by Yalitza Aparicio, is obviously a girl to inspire the very feelings she exudes: she loves the children she saw growing up since the cradle, she's devoted to her ""Signora"" Sofia, played by Marina de Tavira, and she values her luck to be part of that world... she knows she could have been unluckier.It's also interesting that Cleo isn't conventionally good-looking, not in a glamorous Hollywood sense anyway, and her petite frame and youthful face illuminated with a wide smile accentuate her vulnerability. She incarnates a sort of third world within the third world, like an extra layer of fragility making her the perfect target for the kind of troubles no upper class European looking girl would get herself into. Though the film is overarched by the social and political context of Mexico circa 1970-71, I didn't feel like Cuaron tried to make some social commentary, maybe it's just a character study of a woman who could only depend on the kindness of strangers, like Blanche Dubois, but is able to find some inner strength to overcome a blind (but not malicious) adversity if not triumph over it.And indeed, in her harrowing journey (that doesn't follow any pattern of cinematic predictability), it's less in what happens to her than the reactions it inspires. The film is less driven by plot points but the way people react and reactions to their reactions... or non-reactions for that matter. There is an interesting scene where a Karate master shows a trick that looks extremely easy until it's done with closed eyes, I don't know if it was supposed to symbolize one of the film's underlying messages, but it's true that many things that happen are due to people's obliviousness, carelessness or lack of empathy. And near the end, both Cleo and Sofia realize they had more in common than they would have thought, adversity strikes everyone... only in different ways. Blind again, but not malicious.What I liked in ""Roma"", besides its realism, is the fact that it doesn't just try to depict a slice of life but Life with a major L, providing sights often suggested but rarely shown in the movies. Indeed, the film contains many graphic sequences including a naked male body (and I'm sorry to say that it's more distracting for me than a woman's... maybe because the thing ""moves""... chuckles) and one that shouldn't be spoiled but that had me almost gasping with tears because it was the moment where many aspects of an editing that demanded some patience from us finally paid off, and I knew I had to expect a high spot of emotionality sometime in the film. Cuaron's ""Roma"" (whatever the title means) is truly daring by showing life and death with the same clinical detachment from his lenses, one that also shows in the climactic scene, hinted by the poster.Now, I wanted to give he film a 10 because it has reached a cinematic level of perfection I rarely found in a movie but sometimes its beauty just feels so deliberate it becomes sophisticated. The film benefits from Alfonso Cuaron's perfect command of the camera (we're obviously talking of the Oscar-winner for Best Cinematography and maybe Best Director) but the cinematography tends to steal the story's thunder and compromises the film's attempt to be a realistic portrait of a Mexican's slice of life in the 70s in an atmosphere of love devoid of the cynicism we get from today's dysfunctional families. The children in the film are not only adorable but played with an authentic simplicity and since so many directors said it was a nightmare to direct children, Cuaron deserves a credit for that too.So It's precisely because the story is so well told and well acted that I wished it wouldn't be so well directed... though I approve the choice of the black-and-white for no other reason that it gives the film a sort of dreamy aura fitting its nostalgia.Overall, ""Roma"" is a great film with a few haunting moments.",Roma
20,Pjtaylor-96-138044,When in Roma...,7,4 December 2019,"'Roma (2018)' revels in the kind of mundane reality that most movies purposefully seek to avoid. It isn't really about anything specific, other than its central character. As a partially autobiographical piece, it surrounds itself with the sort of details only someone directly involved with its inspiratory events would notice. In this way, it almost feels like an 'inside joke'; a personal exploration of an intimately nostalgic time-period only important to those actually involved with it. Still, it uses its insular events as a way to comment on the social unrest of 1970s Mexico. One of its more powerful scenes involves the heroes caught in the middle of the infamous 'Corpus Christi Massacre'. This comes when the movie is at its most intense and it's a genuinely compelling sequence. Shortly after, the piece delivers what has to be one of the most heartbreaking moments in recent cinema. It's affecting, for sure. Most of the time, though, the flick feels kind of distant, almost like an impartial observer. The floaty, unmotivated camera-work compounds this; it sort of seems to exist in isolation to the characters, unaware and indifferent to what they're doing in front of it. It all feels quite cold and, prior to the previously mentioned heartbreaker, there's never a real sense of emotional connection. The feature isn't dull, just detached. It's incredibly well-made and its performances are almost perfectly realist. Sometimes, the pacing sags and the story is too precise for its own good. These issues aren't deal-breakers but they do have an impact on the experience's overall effect. Generally, the affair is well-conceived and relatively entertaining. It's enjoyable enough for what it is, elevated by standout behind-the-scenes work and some truly impactful segments. 7/10",Roma
21,dromasca,better than 'Green Book',9,13 March 2019,"As I belong to a specie in danger of extinction - those who have not yet subscribed to Netflix -, I had to wait for a rare public screening of Mexican director Alfonso Cuarón's film 'Roma', which almost won the Academy Award in the Best Film category, in order to form an opinion to myself. I'm trying to avoid discussing the 'legitimacy' of Netflix and of the other 'private' distribution channels. I have an opinion, but it does not matter now that I have seen the movie in a cinema. I am trying to judge 'Rome' by the same criteria that I use for any other film, asking the same questions about the way the movie created empathy, taught me new things, impressed me aesthetically and/or I had fun watching it, disconnected from the problems of everyday life. My appreciation according to these criteria is that 'Roma' is a good film, but not a masterpiece.Inspired largely by the director's real biography, 'Roma' has as main heroine Clio, one of the two maids in a middle-class family home in the neighborhood that gives the name of the film in Mexico City. The story takes place in 1970 in a world that is a collection of contrasts: the neighborhood is inhabited by relatively wealthy people but we see a lot of poverty on the streets, the family house is well maintained by servants but signs of decay are present everywhere, the marriage in the family itself is about to fall apart despite the four children. Servants are much more than just servants, Clio is also the caretaker and the confident of the kids and is considered a part of the family in many ways, but class differences are always reminded. The story slowly moves away from the bourgeois house and the family cell, gradually the circles of characters and locations widens, it first includes the social milieu with which the maids are in contact, then the extended family and its social circle, until it includes a panoramic view of several sectors of the Mexican society. The crisis whose symptoms we watched at the private level is more general, it is the crisis of a society haunted by corruption, violence and class differences. 'Roma' makes a zoom-out from being a family film to a social and political fresco.Clio is a character that viewers of this film will not easily forget. The director's love for the woman who inspired the role, a woman who actually still lives with his family, is obvious. The performance of the young Mexican debutante actress Yalitza Aparicio is gorgeous. It's worth watching her in the extraordinary scene at the maternity and then you may ask yourself as I did what it means for a woman to play such a scene. It's not the only memorable scene, there are more in the movie. Alfonso Cuarón has also signed the cinematography and he knows his craftsmanship, combining scenes with camera moving in parallel with the characters, panoramic frames that represent true human and social compositions, long frames, or short frames sequences. The black and white film fits very well and the light is very well used.Besides many qualities, the film also some flaws. Above all the length - some scenes are artificially extended, others seem to try to say too explicitly 'this is an art movie', for example the introductory scene that includes the generic. I wrote a few weeks ago that 'Green Book' seems to have been made with the Academy Awards in mind. So, I think, was 'Roma'. Alfonso Cuarón is well acquainted with the American cinema industry, he has worked in Hollywood and has attended several Academy Awards ceremonies. Even the choice he made to distribute the film on Netflix may have been deliberate, the debate between the camps of the opponents and of the fans of streaming channels will soon end with the victory of the latter, and 'Roma' has skillfully used this momentum. If it had been distributed in cinemas as a Mexican film, it would not have been distributed to larger audiences in the US and around the world, and would not have attracted the attention of the Academy members except maybe for the prize of the best foreign film. So it won (on merit) two more awards (best director, best cinematography) and was very close to winning the big one. It did not succeed, eventually the majority of the jury members preferred the 'Green Book' - a much more conventional film and safer choice. Cuarón and his colleagues can console themselves with the fact that many viewers who have seen both movies believe that 'Roma' is a better film. Including me.",Roma
22,ThomasDrufke,Beautifully Tragic,8,23 December 2018,"I'm often weary of films with tremendous amounts of praise or build up before I get a chance to go see it. Unfortunately, Roma never managed to get to a theater within 50 miles of me, I finally gave it a shot via Netflix. It's still a movie I would have rather seen in a theater setting, but the intimacy of this story certainly works on a small screen as well. Alfonso Cuaron's follow up to his Oscar winning (and one of my favorite films of all time) Gravity, is an emotional rollercoaster and displays a master at work in cinematography and framing. But more importantly, it takes us through a year-long journey in the life of a maid for a family in Mexico City during the 1970's. Cleo, played by non-actress Yalitza Aparicio, is the aforementioned maid and essentially the second parent figure for the middle class family, which goes a good chunk of the film without a father. The only criticism I have for the film is that there isn't a defined arc that Cleo goes on, or at least not the traditional one, so upon first viewing it takes a while to latch on to her character, but it really is a beautiful representation of a slice of life type of story. It doesn't feel like a movie, rather, we are just a fly on the wall for a year of Cleo's life. Whether it be something joyful or tragic, we're there for the ride. What Cuaron managed to give us a mixture of both in the most beautiful way possible.8.7/10",Roma
23,gbill-74877,Beautiful,8,25 September 2020,"The opening shot of a puddle created by a maid mopping, one that soon reflects a plane soaring overhead in the sky, seems to tell us that we're going to see these events from the perspective of someone at the bottom looking up, inverted if you will. It's mirrored in the closing shot before the credits roll.I love how Cuarón wrong-footed me with this film. I didn't know much about it going in, but as it established a couple of young maids working in the house of an affluent family with kids, I thought I was going to see mistreatment as part of a statement on class. We do see the conditions of the wealthy family contrasted to how the maids exist in their little room, as well as what a slum looks like, so it's not as if class isn't explored at all here, and we also see it in small moments like the maid having to stand while the mother and her kids sit, clearly always the low rung on the totem pole. However, the servant is generally treated rather well, even when she unexpectedly gets pregnant, though it's clear she's completely vulnerable to her employer letting her go for it. If anything, the film seems to put more of a mirror up to how men of either class can treat women poorly, and perhaps the most telling line is ""No matter what they tell you, we women are always alone.""The camera work is fantastic throughout the film, but never better than in the sequence out in the waves at Tuxpan. There is such restraint in the storytelling from Alfonso Cuarón, something so realistic here, and the film has probably the best delivery room scenes I've ever seen. Yalitza Aparicio is brilliant as the young woman, oozing authenticity and an enigmatic, Mona Lisa smile. Did I really get to know her character? I'm not sure, but maybe I got to know quite a bit of her through her actions. It's humbling to see her simply moving through her duties without a hint of duplicity or ego, which make the film's big scenes and its quieter moments all the more emotional. She's a beautiful person, and it's a beautiful film.",Roma
24,Cineanalyst,Children of Women,8,15 December 2018,"This one creeps up on you, but it's worth the effort to stay with it for the climactic emotional wallops. Granted, for much of its languorous two-and-a-quarter hours, ""Roma"" appears to be another in a long line of staid domestic dramas--the sort of foreign-language pictures that seem to frequently garner some critical praise around awards season, and this one appears all the more artsy with its desaturated black-and-white look. There's the focus on the lower end of class stratification, with the protagonist Cleo, an indigenous Mexican, as a live-in maid to an educated middle-class family of presumably some European ancestry. While the family of her employers struggles from the abandonment of their father, so does Cleo face her own problems being disavowed by the man who impregnated her. Meanwhile, the narrative occasionally cues us into the political turmoil of its setting in early-1970s Mexico, with the poverty, land seizures and redistribution, and the massacre of student protesters. While much of this is of some interest, especially for offering a semi-autobiographical account of the childhood of one of today's premiere filmmakers, Alfonso Cuarón (""Children of Men"" (2006) and ""Gravity"" (2013), among others), the heart of ""Roma"" is the dramatic arc of Cleo.Characteristic of Cuarón's oeuvre, ""Roma"" is visually splendid, if often times contemplative, as well. The affect of the story seems to necessitate the tendency for long steady takes, but there are some impressive and even ironic compositions, which are heightened by the tendency of framing in long shots. One of my favorites is the shot of the women and children exhausted while on a supposed vacation, abandoned by their men, as a wedding is celebrated in the background, even though a sequence such as the one in the shop during the street demonstrations may be more technically intriguing. There's also all of the business with the cars and the gated garage filled with dog poop. The significance of the repeated views of airplanes, however, somewhat eludes me for the time being (although I suppose it's a visual representation having something to do with the intimate narrative focus within a broader societal context). The water motif is more obvious, and the parallel tracking shots stand out.As far as an insight into the presentation of the filmmaker, as offered by himself, the self-reflexive scenes of movies-within-the-movie may be the most illuminating. Surely, most will be reminded by ""Marooned"" (1969) of Cuarón's own space picture, which earned him an Oscar, ""Gravity."" While that one went so outward that it left the planet, ""Roma"" may be of comparable innovation despite focusing inward.",Roma
25,cricketbat,A beautiful student film made by a professional filmmaker,6,20 February 2019,"It's interesting that after directing films like Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban & Gravity that Alfonso Cuarón would make such a simple slice-of-life story. And even though it's intentionally slow and uneventful, you start to feel like you're a part of the family-much like a live-in maid-and become affected by the small moments. Roma feels like it came from a school film festival, made by a very talented cinematographer.",Roma
26,secondtake,A rare combination of visual beauty and everyday meaning,10,5 January 2019,"There is no shortage of good reviews for this film, and I'm going to add to them quickly. But I'll start by noting there are a number of reviewers who did not like the movie, and I think it was often for the same reasons I liked it.First of all, the black and white cinematography is startling. It gives and gives. Not only is it fluid and almost tender, panning in consistent ways slowly across this Mexican world, but it has so much detail (70mm film detail) that you can look and look and keep finding. Almost as if you were there. And yet there are those who just don't like the restraint of black and white. Would this have worked in color? Of course, in a different way. But the difference would be critical--it would try to make it more ""real"" rather than a portrait of a young woman's world seen from a distance.A distance of time, and of shifting memories. As much as this film is quasi-documentary, you never once think it's truly a documentary. It has too much cinematic beauty. So you enter that world of cinema that is so wonderful, a created world (not a re-created one). And you are then in the hands of the moviemakers.Director (and cinematographer, and writer, and producer, and co-editor) Alfonso Cuarón is clearly making what is ""his"" film here, though the acting is also a key to the success overall. But in planning what to show and what to emphasize in this young maid's life, he finds something that isn't autobiographical, but rather simply perceptive and honest and empathetic. We feel for all young women in their roles as servants to the rich, with the good and bad that goes with it.A great achievement, and one for film buffs and lovers of older films above all. I know Cuarón is one of those, and I hope you are, too, because this will make your day.",Roma

The family dynamic begins to shift, however, when Sofia's husband's absences begin to grow longer and a deadbeat rebel fighter impregnates Cleo.Slow yet startling, subtle yet spirited, writer/director Alfonso Cuarón lovingly retells the tales of his affluent childhood through the eyes of his family's improvised maid in this black-and-white Netflix import that is beautifully shot against the social unrest of 1970s.Best of all, when you clean up after rich kids you know exactly where they hide their allowance.

So is it enough to call it great movie? On one hand, pure craftsmanship - ""Roma"" sure is a great movie, but its story wasn't that much involving for me to be honest. It was a bit hard to get into it, because i did not relate to a main character, nor her life, nor her struggles (except the ones that were universal).Overall, ""Roma"" can be a difficult movie to watch on some boring evening because of a story which is obviously biographical, based on a memories of a master movie maker Alfonso Cuarón - one of my favorite.

30,nairtejas,MAMI Review: Roma (8 Stars),8,28 October 2018,"At around the 100th minute, Roma made me gasp. And then it stole a tiny tear from me. The story of a singleton, who works as a full-time caretaker and maid for an upper middle-class family in Mexico City in the year 1971 is what all the dictionaries around the world should change their definition of the word 'poignant' to. There is no other way to describe what director Alfonso Cuaron has carved in monochrome in Roma which is a film about everything, with an unpredictable and neat narration, somber music, and above all, a never-ending string of beautiful elements to look at. I have this theory that even if you don't watch Roma to understand what it tries to convey and just look at the flowy cinematography and the visually loud frames in motion in front of you, you will feel a peculiar energy transferring into your body. An energy to face the world like the protagonist Cleo faces (or tries to face) in this tragic drama that is built with so much attention to details that I would need an essay to describe the subtexts and small symbolic references that the film makes to send across a message about human nature and relationships, social hierarchy, politics, and violence. Roma made me gasp, laugh, and consider - and it does so in such a random order that you will find it difficult to realize that it's just a film. The running time might remind you that, but let's not talk about it because it is probably the only thing that will prevent you from feeling the film.

32,tomgillespie2002,Cuaron's best and most personal film to date,9,26 March 2019,"You wouldn't know it, but director Alfonso Cuaron has being paying homage to one of the women that helped raise him as a child throughout his career. This woman, Liboria Rodriguez, is clearly close to the filmmaker's heart, and he cast her in cameos in a few of his films, including 2001's Y Tu Mama Tambien. Now, Rodriguez is the topic of her very own film, Roma, Cuaron's ode to the network of women that were key to his upbringing in 1970s Mexico. Of late, Cuaron has mainly focused on big-budget movies for Hollywood, such as last year's Gravity, the riveting thriller Children of Men, and the best Harry Potter film of the series, The Prisoner of Azkaban, but he has dialled things way down for his latest. Roma is about as small-scale as you can get, focusing on a humble maid working for a middle-class family in Mexico City, but complete with the director's trademark dizzying camerawork and gorgeous cinematography.In a debut appearance, Yalitza Aparicio plays Cleo, a maid working in an affluent household in the Colonia Roma neighbourhood in Mexico City. The four children are incredibly affectionate towards her, scrambling for a cuddle when they sit down to watch television, and parents Sofia (Marina de Tavira) and Antonio (Fernando Grediaga) clearly rely on her as they get on with their busy lifestyles. But there are cracks starting to appear in the marriage. Antonio squeezes his bulky, show-off car into the narrow garage every night, hinting at the father's growing dismay with his surroundings, and he quickly grows frustrated when Cleo fails to clean up the dog s**t littering the patio. However, as happy and content as she may appear on the surface, Cleo has to deal with her own problems when she falls pregnant to a martial-arts obsessed military type who is nowhere to be found. With her employers' marriage falling apart and a baby on the way, Cleo struggles to juggle attempting to hold the family together for the sake of the children, and the idea of starting life as a single mother.Trying to summarise the plot of Roma is no easy task. This is a slice of life plucked from Cuaron's own memories, shot in luscious black-and-white that almost feels like remembering the past through an old photograph. Roma is about class, politics and poverty, but mainly it wishes to tell a story of an unseen hero whose stories are rarely told. It's a film of moments that leave a mark despite how inconsequential they appear, very similar to the neo-Realist films of Satyajit Ray and Robert Rossellini, somehow telling a story that feels vast and epic in scale while keeping the focus on an incredibly personal level. Cuaron is a true craftsman, and, with regular collaborator Emmanuel Lubezki unavailable, actually steps up to the role of cinematographer. This compromise actually worked out in the film's favour, as you couldn't imagine anyone else recreating a time and place from one's childhood with such detail and intimacy. Liboria Rodriguez is clearly a huge inspiration in Cuaron's life, and here the director steps aside to shine the spotlight on her and many other that disappear into the crowd. It was a surprise to learn that Roma would be distributed through Netflix, but after seeing the film, it's hard to believe that any studios would take a gamble on what is essentially a collection of memories played out on screen. But what beautiful memories they are.",Roma
33,eddie_baggins,A magnificent feat of filmmaking,9,16 December 2018,"Quite simply a considered and beautifully bound together work of art, Oscar winning director Alfonso Cuarón's black and white love letter to his home country of Mexico is a stunning achievement, a film that at first seems like a small and intimate character study but slowly and assuredly becomes so much more as it encapsulates issues and themes that still resonate strongly today.Named after a famous district of Mexico city, Roma is set in the early 1970's and focusses its attention on newcomer Yalitza Aparicio's young maid Cleo, who finds herself trying to maintain a household around a sad and depressive break-up all the while dealing with the fact she is soon to be a mother herself, to a baby of a father who wants nothing to do with her.It's far from the most original set-up but thanks to Cuarón's masterful delivery of the subject matter and material, Roma quickly shows off why it has been hailed as a genuine threat at next year's Oscar's ceremony.Magnificently captured by Cuarón, who acts as his very own D.O.P here, Roma, with its largely improvised script and cast of unrecognisable faces, is the type of film that over its 130 minutes will begin to feel like something akin to a documentary as we are well and truly transported to this very particular time and place, Roma becoming the type of film that you can smell, feel and touch as Cuarón brings his tale to vivid life.Accompanied by the sounds and eccentricities of the vividly unique country (Roma is completely bereft of any musical score), Cuarón's personal film is made alive thanks to its astounding sound and production design as we follow Cleo on a yearlong journey through the turbulent period of Mexico's history.It's one of the most immersive and all encapsulating experiences you will have all year and one that's deserving of a cinema visit if you can find a local screening, it's as if you yourself are walking the streets, a fly on the wall in these households as Cuarón brings us into his passionately recreated world.Roma really is the work of a director operating at the top of his powers, no shot feels wasted, each one framed and shot in a way that comes from the mind of a director who knows exactly what he wants and how he wants it to be and after a run that has included Children of Men, Gravity and now this, it's safe to say that Cuarón is one of the greatest filmmaker's working today.If there was nit-picking to be done with Cuarón awards calibre film, it would be that the film starts off particularly slow, with some viewers likely to be wondering what the point of the whole exercise is but if you can stick it out, Roma morphs steadily into an emotionally engaging and at times heart wrenchingly powerful film, with a last act that is up there with the best filmmaking seen over the last few years.Final Say -Look out A Star is Born! Roma has stamped itself as an official Oscar heavyweight, as Cuarón's film is not only the best film to be released through the Netflix production house, but one of the year's most unforgettable and magical examples of movie-making.4 ½ martial arts showcases out of 5",Roma
34,Red-125,Best movie I've seen in 2018!,10,23 December 2018,"Roma (2018) was written and directed by Alfonso Cuarón. I find it incredible that Cuarón also did the cinematography. (It's amazing to consider a director who actually operates the camera.)Despite the title, this is a Mexican movie. (Roma is a district in Mexico City.) The protagonists are sophisticated members of the upper middle class. There's one exception--the lead role of Cleo is played by Yalitza Aparicio. Cleo is the maid. She comes from a poor rural area, and is clearly of indigenous heritage. (In fact, the actor Yalitza Aparicio is, indeed from a poor rural indigenous village.)The movie actually has two plots. One is of a upper middle class family in crisis. The other is the Dirty War carried out by the Mexican government in 1971. (The movie is set in 1971.) When we hear the term ""Dirty War,"" we think of Argentina. However, Mexico had its own terrible Dirty War, and it is featured prominently in the film.This is a great movie. The plot is wonderful, the direction is wonderful, and the cinematography is wonderful. Who could believe that one person could carry this off? Well, not only one person. The other person is Yalitza Aparicio.Aparicio is a superb actor. As director Cuarón has said, ""Without Cleo, the movie doesn't work."" I would add that without Aparicio, Cleo wouldn't work. It's impossible to believe that Roma was her first movie, but it's true. I'm certain that she'll become a star.The movie itself has a very high IMDb rating of 8.3. As soon as it reaches 25,000 ratings, it will be in the IMDb top 250 movies of all time.We saw the film at Rochester's excellent Little Theatre.

36,TheMovieDiorama,Roma ravishingly depicts family and loss from Cuarón's personal perspective.,10,14 December 2018,"Typically I would wait a few hours to gather my thoughts and write my review. Not this time. There's no need to even doubt the only word that describes this film. Perfection. Absolutely magnificent. There is not a single flaw to be had in this delicately crafted drama. Honestly, I'm slightly overwhelmed with emotions. This is the reason why Alfonso Cuarón is, in my opinion, the greatest director working today. This is why world cinema far exceeds the limitations of Hollywood clichés. This, is pure cinematic bliss. A masterwork in filmmaking. A house maid to a wealthy family soon becomes pregnant and must cope with the responsibility that rapidly approaches. A story primarily focusing on family, thematically conveying unity and faith in times of chaos and conflict. Where both revolutions and arguments are parallels to each other, causing rifts in communities and families. It's a drama entirely focused on a servant who views her employer's family as her own. She's willing to risk her life for them. She looks out for them, cares for them and consistently thinks about them. The inner turmoil which occurs when she unexpectedly becomes pregnant soon manifests into regret, worrying about losing the family she currently has. It's a drama filled with love and tragedy, one that will evoke an array of emotions. Happiness, hatred and sorrow. This plethora allows you to become absorbed in the monochromatic world that Cuarón presents. It transfixes you until the very last scene, pulling you closer word by word. 'Gravity' is my favourite film of all time. Cuarón has had a perfect career. But Roma, well, it might just be his finest work to date. It's a tale filled with personality. You can sense how personal this story meant to him, through his gorgeous editing and cinematography. His childhood memories come to life by utilising captivating camera techniques. Sublime tracking shots, precise panning and his renowned one take scenes. You can't afford to blink. Not even once.Aparicio's performance should not be missed. Not for one second. Incredibly nuanced yet irrefutably powerful. She brings humanity into her character, creating an achingly beautiful individual in the process. Everything about this drama felt real. No Hollywood clichés, no moments of absurdity. Just sheer visceral drama that captures the equilibrium of what it is to be part of a family. Every shot was mesmerising. Every word spoken waa felt. I just can't. I can't. Seriously shaken to the core with how perfect this film was. There is a moment in this film where conflict breaks out on a street. The proceeding twenty minutes was possibly the most emotionally distressing period of time I've witnessed in film. Ever. Cleo is so well developed that I started to cry during the third act. Yes, there were moments of devastation. But I cried because my passion for film as a medium just took over. I couldn't control myself. Cuarón took every aspect of filmmaking and turned it into a work of cinematic art. He understands film in its entirety. Roma not only gets a perfect rating. Not only does it becomes the best of the year by far. It becomes one of the best films I have ever seen.",Roma
37,matthewssilverhammer,"no, it's NOT homework.",10,9 February 2019,"Cuaron continues making some of the most emotionally engrossing and visually intentional films in the modern climate. In Roma, he treats the Mexican experience (and in the macro, all of humanity) like a Monet painting or a marching band. From afar, things seem beautiful and in order. But the closer you get, the more chaotic it appears, though no less beautiful. Achingly gorgeous, unexpectedly funny, and clearly personal, it's the only 2018 film that truly wrecked me by the end.",Roma
38,imseeg,""" I like being dead... """,9,18 March 2019,"The (gorgeously photographed) final end credits give a mention worthy special thanks: ""Por Libo"". Libo was the nanny of this very director, who was inspired to make this picture about her, based on the love his nanny gave to him as a young boy.However charming this ""tribute to a nanny"" might seem, I had some doubts beforehand HOW this director could make a story interesting (and not tedious), when it was just about an oridinary housemaid. Yet he succeeded brilliantly in mesmirising me from beginning to end anyway. How did he do it? Well, HOW he did it, is what earned him oscars for best direction and photography. More about the good later on, first the bad, although there is very little bad...The bad; the leading character isnt very charismatic. Ofcourse the leading character isnt suppose to be charismatic, because she is just playing the part of a simple housemaid. But therein lies the only minor fault of this picture: the leading character does NOT evoke a lot of emotions. Consequently ""Roma"" certainly is NOT a hardhitting, emotional drama.After 30 minutes I was still wondering where this story would take me. Not bored, but a bit puzzled that not many dramatic events seemed to happen or were even about to start happening. This movie toddles along for quite a while.The good. Roma is truly one of the most touching, subtle, mesmirising portraits of family life I have ever seen on the silver screen over the past several decades. Thankfully this Netflix picture was released in a few cinemas as well, because this movie is best appreciated when there are no phones or doorbells ringing when watching, because it has an incredibly slowburning, fragile pace.""Roma"" feels as if life is unfolding in front of my eyes, with truly breathtaking photography. Merely the end credit titles by themselves are of a magnificent beauty and creativity which left the entire audience silent untill the very last end credit title rolled over the screen: SHANTIH SHANTIH SHANTIH.",Roma
39,paul-allaer,"BEST MOVIE of the year, period... ""To a beautiful 1971""",10,16 December 2018,"""Roma"" (2018 release; 135 min,) brings the story of Cleo, a live-in maid/nanny/housekeeper to a middle-class family in the Roma neighborhood of Mexico City. As the movie opens, we see her cleaning the house, making lunch for the 4 kids, and we get to know the couple, a doctor and his wife. It all seems quite idyllic. The doctor then needs to attend a conference in Montreal, but in reality he is separating from his wife... At this point we're 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: when we last heard from writer-editor-photographer-producer-director Alfonso Cuaron, it was 2013 when he went on to win multiple Oscars for the stand-out film ""Gravity"". Having taking his time to decide what to do next, Cuaron went on to revisit his own self, taking a look at his upbringing in Mexico City. The movie is set as 1970 turns into 1971, when Cuaron himself was 8-9 years old. The movie centers around the ups and downs in the life of Cleo, one of the two maids in the family, but of course along the way we follow the family itself, as Cleo is an integral part of the household. The genius of the movie s that Cuaron simply observes characters in which we become emotionally involved, and then lets the camera roll, often in a single shot that lasts for minutes on. Shot in nuanced B&W, the movie itself becomes very nuanced, and breath-taking. Check out the New Year's Day celebrations, as the family visits an uncle, and Cleo ends up going to a separate celebration for the locals, and she wistfully raises a glass ""to a beautiful 1971"", not realizing what awaits her yet. Yalitza Aparicio (a complete unknown to me) is masterful in her role as Cleo. Keep an eye out for the sweeping photography when there is unrest in the city as students/rebels clash against police, wow, just wow. I had recently made my ""10 best of 2018"" movie list, and after I saw ""Roma"", I immediately realized that I needed to redo that list, as ""Roma"" is the best movie of the year, period. Yes, it is THAT good.""Roma"" premiered at this year's Venice film festival, and has slowly been rolling out to US theaters. It finally opened at my local art-house theater this weekend here in Cincinnati, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this was attended okay (about 20 people), and the audience was spellbound (you could hear a needle drop upon the movie's concluding scene). If you have an interest in a HUMAN story that will touch you in more than one way, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. ""Roma"" is a WINNER all the way.",Roma
40,jtindahouse,A beautiful and intelligent film that could be studied for years,8,24 February 2019,"'Roma' is the heavy favourite to win the Best Picture award at the Academy Awards ceremony tomorrow and I can understand why. I don't think it's the most entertaining or perhaps even the best of the eight nominated films, however it does have a lot going for it. It's unquestionably the most beautifully shot film of the bunch. It also has an incredible amount of symbolism and is a film that could be studied by film students for years to come. Then add in the little nods towards cinema (every Best Picture winner has to have them and Alfonso Cuarón's best friend Guillermo del Toro knows that better than anyone and you can bet he had an influence on those otherwise pointless settings being in the film) and I think you do indeed have a Best Picture winning film.Yalitza Aparicio, in her debut film nonetheless, has been nominated for Best Actress in a leading role. She was superb and the fact I had no clue until reading about it after the film that this was her first performance says a lot. Marina de Tavira has also been nominated for the film in the Best Actress in a Supporting Role category. She was still impressive in her limited chances, but didn't quite shine to the extent Aparicio managed to. I can't see either getting the win but they are well deserved nominations.'Roma' is a very intelligent film. There are so many little moments that could easily seem innocuous, but in hindsight actually had incredible amounts of depth behind them. There is also one masterfully crafted scene that will go down as one of the most hard to watch and devastating things I've ever seen in a film. There are a couple of other films I would prefer to see win the award over this, however I'm not going to be upset when the name 'Roma' is read out either (like I was last year with 'The Shape of Water'). This is a very fine film no doubt about it. Also, are Mexicans taking over the cinematic universe or what? Every film they make at the moment seems to be at least considered gold.",Roma
41,Turfseer,Beautiful cinematography subsumed by portrait of an overly saintly protagonist,5,30 January 2019,"Based on the childhood recollections of Director Alfonso Cuarón, Roma is set in the Colonia Roma neighborhood of Mexico City in the early 70s. I was much impressed with Cuarón's 2013 mainstream sci-fi picture, Gravity, a visual tour-de-force. Here he's decided to try his hand at art house fare and once again has hit a home run in the visual department. Filmed in black and white, Roma is a film filled with striking images as well as a stunning soundtrack which features no music-instead there is only ambient sound which captures the atmosphere of Cuarón's middle class household as well as other neighborhoods in Mexico City which prove fraught with political tension and violence.
Sadly Cuarón, while a brilliant visual director, is not much of a screenwriter. His protagonist, Cleo (played by newcomer and non-professional actress Yalitza Aparicio) is a maid who works for Senora Sofia, mother of four children. Also in the household is the grandmother (Sofia's mother) and Antonio, the doctor husband who is rarely at home. There's also Adela, employed as a cook and friend of Cleo.
Cuarón wastes a great deal of time in the expository scenes as he introduces us to Cleo and the family. The daily drudgery of Cleo's job is depicted along with a mother who has some trouble containing her unruly kids. It's also suggested that the relationship between husband and wife is not good and as we eventually see, falls apart completely. It takes over half an hour before the break into the Second Act occurs. Judicious editing could have solved the problem of lugubrious pacing but Cuarón seems enamored with presenting his ""photo scrapbook"" of memories and recollections which amount to one vignette after another at the expense of character development.
While Aparicio does a remarkable job for a first-time actor, her Cleo is an unrealized and underdeveloped character. Cuarón emphasizes Cleo's ""quiet dignity"" but in doing so puts her on a pedestal. In other words, she has virtually no flaws or idiosyncrasies except for being shy (if you can call that a flaw). In the second half, Cuarón elevates her to virtual sainthood in a traumatic and tragic childbirth scene along with a scene at the beach, where she saves two of the children from drowning.
The ""break into two"" occurs when Cleo learns she is pregnant after going to bed with Fermin, a martial arts enthusiast who turns out to be the boyfriend from hell. Aside from Cleo, all the other characters in the film are shown at a distance and hence we never get a feeling for them as real people. The mother in particular is depicted in this way, with scenes where she becomes cross with the children or is seen driving the car into the garage after drinking.
Occasionally the plot intrudes as Cleo reveals her suspicions of pregnancy to Sofia, who caringly brings her to the hospital where she is checked out by a gynecologist. There's more lugubrious pacing as Cleo spends a good amount of time attempting to locate Fermin who has disappeared. It turns out that Fermin is likely part of a roving band of paramilitary youths, known as Los Falcones (The Hawks). Cleo finds him at an athletic field where this large group of young men are involved in martial arts training. That's where Fermin threatens Cleo with bodily harm if she ever looks him up again.
Perhaps the best (and most riveting) part of the film takes place where Cleo and her grandmother find themselves in a store shopping for a crib and a riot starts up right outside the building. A group of Socialist oriented protestors are suddenly set upon by members of Los Falcones and shockingly Fermin is one of them. Right in front of Cleo, the young fascists shoot and kill one of the protestors who has just entered the store seeking refuge from the violence outside. For a moment it appears Fermin is about to shoot Cleo, but he backs off and leaves.
Unfortunately we never find out much about Fermin and the group he belongs to. As with most of the characters here, Cuarón provides a mere impressionistic glimpse. There are never any significant political discussions among the characters that fill us in on the background and context of the violent political scene existing in Mexico at the time.
Cuarón leaves his two most harrowing moments for the second act ""dark moment"" and third act crisis. The failed childbirth and scene in which Cleo saves Sonia's children from drowning are designed to merely reinforce what we've been told throughout the film: Cleo's saintliness is unassailable.
Ultimately Cuarón's veritable portrait of a saint does not lend itself to good drama. Nor does presenting the supporting players at a decided distance add to the overall verisimilitude. Cuarón's cinematography is beautiful so see the film for the visual and auditory elements. Don't expect much in terms of character development-as Cuarón is unable to craft all his memories into a compelling, suspenseful plot.",Roma
42,billcr12,Draining,7,20 December 2018,"Roma is a long and emotionally draining film. Yalitza Aparicio is the Main character and she is terrific. She is the housekeeper in an upper middle class home in Mexico where she takes care of four young children; two boys and two girls. Mom and dad are professionals who leave almost everything to the young domestic. The black and white scenery are spectacular but the screaming children and barking dogs frankly wore me out. I admire the artistic merits of Roma. Cuaron is clearly a genius. Unfortunately, at the end of two hours and fifteen minutes I was happy that the movie had finally ended. Children of Men was a better movie by the same director from back in 2006.",Roma

44,robfollower,Roma is emotionally powerful from start to finish,10,24 February 2019,"A year in the life of a middle-class family's maid in Mexico City in the early 1970s. The most personal project to date from Academy Award (R)-winning director and writer Alfonso Cuaron (Gravity, Children of Men, Y Tu Mama Tambien), ROMA follows Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio), a young domestic worker for a family in the middle-class neighborhood of Roma in Mexico City. Delivering an artful love letter to the women who raised him, Cuaron draws on his own childhood to create a vivid and emotional portrait of domestic strife and social hierarchy amidst political turmoil of the 1970s. Cuaron's first project since the groundbreaking Gravity in 2013.Alfonso Cuaron only graces us with a film every so often, but every time it is so worth the wait. Returning to his routes after several big-budget outings, Roma is a simple but effective slice-of-life drama destined to go down in history as one of the masterpieces of foreign cinema. Featuring phenomenal performances from a cast of unknowns and non-actors, led by an especially heartbreaking turn by Yalitza Apricio, this is easily Cuaron's most personal film to date. It's a piece of cinema that, whilst mostly grounded in the mundane, finds the grandeur and cinematic potential in every conceivable moment. Cuaron's beautiful black-and-white photography is gorgeous and features some of the best shots in cinema this year, and that beauty that makes it so tragic that most audiences (myself included) never got to see this on the big screen. On the plus side, Roma being a Netflix film means you have little excuse to miss out on it. Put aside some time, sit back, and experience the potential cinema still has as an art form. Roma is emotionally powerful from start to finish and I simply can't recommend it enough.",Roma
45,CubsandCulture,A directionless screenplay undermines an otherwise worthwhile film,6,19 December 2018,"Cuaron really should have brought in another writer as the resulting screenplay is rudderless and unfocused. Apparently it is intended to be a slice of life, a year of a upper middle class Mexican family in the 70's but it lacks narrative drive and emotional heft. Films are not life and one should only go so far trying to replicate the experience. Too many of the fundamental dynamics of the story are left unexplained. Worse of all to give the film something resembling tension Cauron repeatedly uses cheap tricks of chance to provide dramatic shape. The act of nature that defines the climax is largely out of left field; it is simply devoid of dramatic meaning as a result. Many of the characters and several of the scenes showed a lot of promise but the overall story is a mess of underwritten so-called realism.Nonetheless, the film is worth seeing once. The acting is quite good and it almost sells the narrative. But best of all the simple minimal direction presents an ""objective"" look you often don't get in period pieces. Moreover, the cinematography is gorgeous, moody black and white. The film is Cauron at his visual best. It is just enough to make me like the final film.This is worth seeing if you have Netflix. It is not worth getting Netflix for.",Roma

In many respects it is a very classy soap opera, but made up with so many absorbing scenes which mix high emotion, humour, even shock and great tension that by the end you know the characters so well and empathise with their hardships that you yearn for more.A great film - so clever - shame he doesn't make them very often",Roma
47,iquine,Smartly Done,8,4 January 2019,"(Flash Review)I was drawn to this film from the massive marketing blitz for it so I gave it a shot. Glad I did. The film lulls you into the way of life of a mid-upper class Spanish family and their two servant woman and everyone's immediate life struggles. You tend to watch scenes play out at a distance. The upper class mother of four kids has her husband go away for long distance durations, cheats and lies yet he is not really on screen much. At the same time the primary servant woman, who is the main character, gets pregnant and the guy refuses to be a man when he learns the news. This doesn't paint the men in these women's lives very well and for good reason. There is not an obvious plot yet lots of daily life activities that give the viewer time to digest current circumstances and the rich depth and secondary stuff going on within each scene helps this feel very real. I love the smooth panning and tracking camera movements that give the film an engaging visual appeal complimented by very nice black and white cinematography. Much of the story is conveyed through visuals and atmosphere. This is a great film that allows the user to connect the dots themselves a little; doesn't spoon feed anything. I wish I was a bit more emotionally connected to the characters as there are a few heavy emotional moments.",Roma
48,smatysia,Don't really see the point,5,7 September 2020,"There is a lot here that is good. But at the end, I wondered what was the point? The main character, Cleo, played very well by Yalitza Aparicio, who was not a professional actress, has a lot happening to her, but in the end, she remains as enigmatic and taciturn as at the beginning. A subtext seems to be the social stratification between the Caucasian looking upper classes, and the very Indian looking lower class. In reading up on the film on this site, I see that it is an ode to the director's memories of his childhood. OK, but that's not enough. I also find the black and white presentation an annoying affectation, particularly since it is portraying a time when films were in color. Sorry, Sr. Cuaron, but it bored me.",Roma
49,arthur_tafero,Roma - Best Film of the 21st Century,10,25 May 2020,"I have seen well over 15000 films; some of them more than once. There are only a handful of films that compare to this masterpiece. Director Alfonso Cuarons is head and shoulders above every other director of the 21st century. His writing and cinematography (which is magnificent) are unequalled. You are not even aware there is a camera filming the scenes. The performances of everyone in the film are perfect. The performance of the actress who plays Cleo is electric. If you don't cry at this film, you better get your body checked for having a heart.The film is harrowing and heartbreaking at the same time. It is even BETTER than the heretofore impregnable bastion of neo-realism films of Italian cinema from 1945-1955. I wrote a book on those films and I always thought they would NEVER be equalled.. This film does the impossible; it equals Italian neorealism with Mexican neorealism.There have been other great films from South of the Border before such as the brilliant City of God by Meirelles Lund of Brazil. This had been the reigning champion of foreign films before Roma. Now, it is still a great film, but Roma is the first neorealism film that captures BOTH the day to day problems of the poor AND the upper class. Of course, we are more sympathetic to the poor working class girl, Cleo, than we are to the unfortunate wife and children of the rich doctor. But that tragedy comes right through the screen as well as Cleo's trials. If there is a more tragic scene in cinema than the birthing room scene of Cleo, I certainly have not seen one; and I have seen almost all of them. Welcome to finest film of the 21st century (not just FOREIGN film) and one of the top ten films of all time.",Roma

51,kluseba,Nostalgic depth,7,15 February 2019,"Roma is a critically acclaimed drama by renowned director Alfonso Cuarón that has autobiographical elements and is also a homage to the housemaid he grew up with. It tells the story of young maid Cleo who works in the suburb of Roma in Mexico City in the early seventies. She works for an upper middle-class family who is on the verge of falling apart when the father never comes home from a business trip and has secretly started a new life with a younger woman. Cleo has some issues of her own as she is pregnant with a child she has never wanted and the child's father vanishes as soon as she tells him about it. At the same time, civil unrest increases steadily in Mexico City and has profound impacts on the entire country. In this time of change, Cleo tries to make it through and find out what she really wants to do with her life.The movie has several strong points that justify its great reputation. The camera work is calm, intense and precise. The movie is shot in black and white which gives it nostalgic depth. The acting performances are authentic and especially rookie lead actress Yalitza Aparicio has a raw natural talent. The movie deals with several profound topics such as family, friendship and trust. The film isn't moralizing but the viewer can't help but think about the characters' at times debatable or controversial actions, decisions and thoughts. This movie invites you to analyze, discuss and think about it.The film also has a few downsides. The pace is particularly slow and at times dragging for no justifiable reason. The film would have been more concise, entertaining and intense if it had been shortened by at least a half hour. While the plot is intriguing, it starts without a proper introduction and also ends without a conclusion which underlines a somewhat unfocused script writing. The movie basically exposes a slice of life but fails to wrap up its loose ends.In the end, Roma is a good drama that convinces with authentic acting performances, great camera work and profound topics that offer food for thought. However, the film isn't as great as its reputation and suffers from a slow pace and unfocused script writing. If you like emotional dramas or Mexican culture, you should watch this movie. Everyone else can however ignore it and shouldn't get too excited over the exaggeratedly positive reviews. Shoplifters, another foreign drama nominated for an Academy Award, is clearly the better film and should have gotten the attention Roma has received over the past few months.",Roma

55,masonfisk,MEXICO MORE LIKE IT...!,9,11 February 2019,"Alfonso Cauron's Oscar nominated film is a tribute to the nanny who raised him during the 70's in Mexico. Shot in glorious black & white (by the director acting as his own d.p.) this sense memory put to film aligns a time when a middle class family was breaking down (the doctor/husband has abandoned his clan under the guise of a business trip to Canada) when revolution & political discord was rearing its ugly head upsetting the status quo which continues to this day. The story is told from the vantage point of the young servant named Cleo who bides her tongue & does what she can to survive as an unexpected pregnancy soon becomes the focal problem in her life even though her duties seem to take precedent over everything. Adopting almost a CCV esthetic (the camera seems to be at a distance constantly panning back & forth as the action unfolds before it) w/myriad details happening within the mise en scene of the frame. Cleo takes a bus trip to confront the deadbeat who knocked her up & as she disembarks from the bus we're engulfed by a vista recently visited by a downpour (inhabitants are using wood planks to cross over muddy pot holes) w/an incongruous shot of a carnival taking place in the background as a cannon fires sending its occupant into a waiting net. This constant detail layering works wonders as one is compelled to rewatch this feature for all the minutiae one might've missed upon initial viewing. Will it win Best Picture? I don't think so since the film is also up for Best Foreign Language & if memory serves the same scenario played out for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon almost 2 decades ago (it was dual nominated) & they only came away w/the lesser award (which isn't a dis).",Roma

Alfonso Cuarón shows us the raw nature of Mexico. At times, the setting showcases the blink existence of these characters. You need to search long and hard to find any signs of hope. As we witness Cleo's struggle, we begin to understand what the movie's intentions are. Roma is a foreign film in more ways that one. Many viewers are unable to sit through this movie.

I knew I was in trouble from the opnening scene of a symmetrically tiled floor being washed. Interesting it wasn't, but for sure it lasted a very long time. The unexciting opening credits were followed by disconnected episodes in the life of a large family and their two maids. Apologies to the politically correct police, but for a while I could not distinguish one maid from the other. After a while I learnt one was Cleo and the other Adela.We focus on Cleo, who gets pregnant by an ""inconsiderate"" lover (understatement of the year). In the meantime, Sofia, the lady of the house is dumped by her doctor husband for a younger model. Sofia must take care of their four kids on her own, but does not seem quite up to the task. All this slightly soap-opera drama is seen from a distance, dialogues are boring and few and far between. There is no building of tension or plot development.Other than this being filmed in black & white to offer a political statement of some sort, there is nothing that strucks me as genuinely moving. As a commercial operation, it's certainly the perfect Oscar bait. Yet another Mexican director will bag the big prize and everybody will be righteously happy that justice prevailed....

58,truemythmedia,The Most Human Film of 2018,9,25 July 2019,"Art is subjective. When you first look at a piece of art you bring with it your whole person. You bring everything you've thought and wished for, everything you've imagined and dreamed, and everything that you've seen that has helped to shape you into the person you are when you see it. When you approach artwork, be it a painting, a film, a book, or a piece of music, you aren't a blank slate, you yourself are a complex and emotional work of art, one that changes and evolves based on where you are in your life and what you've experienced. Your experiences, and everything in you, gives you certain unique worldview that will affect how you see something vs how the person standing next to you sees something. I can look at Botticelli's The Birth of Venus and understand that it is a masterpiece, but it doesn't stir in me a wonder at the majesty of the universe like when I look at van Gogh's Starry Night. With that out of the way, let me say that Alfonso Cuaron's Roma is undoubtedly a masterpiece. It is a technical marvel in every sense of the phrase; it's one of the most human films I've ever seen; it's utterly gorgeous as far as its production design and crafting of the world. But... out of all of the Best Picture nominees that I have seen this year, if I'm being honest, I will be least likely to come back to this film. Why? It's a masterpiece, yes, but it's not the kind of film I want to sit down to watch over and over again.

His autobiographical film takes moviegoers on a journey to his past.Set in the 1970-71, it follows the life of his live-in housekeeper and nanny, Cleo (a winning Yalitza Aparicio), whose unconditional devotion to him and his well-to-do family becomes the main story told in a stream-of conscientious approach. The film's storytelling tend to meander depicting a series of true events that happened during the director's teenage years. But visually, the film is stunning throughout. Even if the narrative becomes monotonous, and it does, the imagery is so artistically rendered that one need only focus on the photography to envelop the true moviegoing experience.Directed, written, co-edited (with Adam Gough), and lensed in glorious in black & white by Mr. Cuarón, the film has many moments beautifully captured (a jet plane reflected in sudsy water, a house overstuffed with macabre taxidermic animals and beloved dead pets, children's toys scatter in disarray on a kitchen table, a student protest seen through a store window, a wedding photo shoot with happy bride and recent divorcee yards away from each other showing the martial extremes, etc.) Just observing the labor of washing a tile floor becomes high art in Mr. Cuarón's lovely camerawork. Pure genius.While his screenplay is too leisurely paced and rarely approaches the director's level of technical excellence, the characters and their situations are interesting enough to hold one's attention. We meet the naive and overworked maid named Cleo. She is the uniting force in the household which consists of a self-centered Sofia, mother of four young children, her philandering husband, Antonio, Sofia's mother, Teresa, and another maid, Adela. Cleo is also dating Fermín, a man of questionable means. Vignettes of various events throughout the year intertwine to show the changes in these character's lives. Yet the film doesn't really build to any clear-cut narrative or compelling message. It merely states these oft quiet moments in time matter-of-factly, with no real emotional impact or pay-off. The artful images will linger, the story does not.Roma may not deserve the gushing accolades it is receiving, but this is still a remarkable tribute to a woman who nurtured this talented man through boyhood. Some scenes are more powerful than others and the overall effect of the storytelling may be less than thrilling due to the mundane daily existence of the characters' lives. But Mr. Cuarón's sincere attempt to share his personal valentine with the world is a testament to behold. Roma is a memory play told in cinematic terms, a loving portrait of days gone by, never to be seen again.",Roma
62,Amyth47,Boring as hell!,1,16 December 2018,"My Rating : 1/10'Roma' is a very personal film I understand, Alfonso Cuaron the director wanted to recreate some of his childhood memories and it took him years to finally make it.I found the movie to be slow, mundane and aside from 2-3 scenes it is simply too bland for my taste. Also, they've used CGI in a lot of scenes (yes, the final beach scene as well) but who cares when it's this boring. Suffice to say it is perhaps one of the most boring movies I've ever seen.",Roma
63,EdgarST,Crying on the Beach,5,22 December 2018,"Overrated.
Overlong.
Good cinematography, art direction and choice of songs.
Fermín (Cleo's boyfriend) sets the movie on fire, but he is around too little. He is the Wolf, the Monster, and the Terror of Underdevelopment. He even symbolically kills his own daughter.
Kids are always kids, and so are old people, they steal scenes, etcetera, as the heroic WonderGranny who takes Cleo to the hospital through a street riot.
Premonitions are cinegenic, especially in New Year, in a forest, with a few pines on fire and a Nordic guy (sort of) posing in front of the camera and singing...
There is even an earthquake alert and someone playing Profesor Zovek training a group of martial arts freaks (including Fermín).
As in most Mexican melodramas, everything is solved with a good weep.
But the scene on the beach verges on the ridicule. Caramel coated solidarity (see the poster).
Cleo the servant becomes SuperCleo for a while. Then she is a servant again.
In the end credits, some links are included for good measure, in case you want to join the fight for the rights of women and servants, and for the cause of maids in the USA.",Roma

66,framptonhollis,"subtle, visceral, beautiful",8,10 February 2019,"I have so far seen four of this year's Best Picture nominees, and there is no doubt that 'Roma' is the very best of the bunch. It is the only of the four nominees I have seen that is able to reach true greatness, and it is able to do so through subtlety and atmosphere. I'll admit that I am a fan of melodramatic films when they are done well, but there is really something special about a film like 'Roma' that is able to incorporate some scenes of such emotional intensity and impact in what often boils down to a slice of life look at the setting of director Cuarón's childhood. Every scene has a quiet nature to it, making the few sequences that depart from ordinary life and instead burst with action all the more impactful while still remaining tonally consistent with the rest of the film. Add on to this a clear central arc and you have yourself what, in many ways, borders on being a masterpiece. Not to mention, the cinematography is some of the most gorgeous I have ever seen. In stunning black and white, most of the film consists of extremely wide shots, the mis en scene often filled with characters and props, making even the most mundane of things take on greater power, greater beauty. The sound design immerses the viewer even further into this nostalgic and cinematic world, often bursting with the surprisingly meaningful sounds of daily life. On a technical level, the film looks, sounds, and feels like an epic on a grand scale, but, at its core, it is an extremely intimate and slow moving drama. Even when historical events interfere with the central storyline, they serve as something of a backdrop helping further express the main character's internal conflicts. It does not seek to make some grand statement about the historical or political, and it does not need to. Sometimes, merely observing the lives of seemingly ordinary, ""unimportant"" people is more than enough, and the way 'Roma' contrasts with many of this year's award-winning films proves this.",Roma

69,nancyldraper,Technically perfect but...,5,27 January 2019,"This film was meant to be a work of art and a nostalgic tribute to the women of Alfonso Cuaron's youth. It excels in all its technical aspects, and has been rewarded by critical and award attention. It's setting and title are to evoke a neighbourhood of the Colonia Roma district in a turbulent period of Mexican politics. The storytelling is painstakingly natural and realistic, meant to keep the audience in the everyday, unedited minutiae of the moment. The cinematography is all about casting a panoramic view of the moments, inviting the viewer to explore each detail of the rolling frame of the camera lense. The camera is the storyteller. Knowing all this to be true, I didn't care for the film. The choice of black and white eliminated all the colour of Mexico in the 70s - a time and place of rampant colour - which made no sense in a movie dependent on the audience being lost in the detail of real life. I did not find myself lost in the slow pan of the camera - I found myself bored. Many reviewers said they found themselves helpless with weeping - I was not caught up in the pathos or struggle of these women for I felt I was kept at arm length by the distance of the camera. Of the 10 Oscar categories of nomination this film garnered (Best Picture / Actress / Supporting Actress / Cinematography / Director / Foreign Language Film / Production Design / Sound Editing / Sound Mixing / Writing Original Screenplay), I am most bewildered by Best Original Screenplay. For me it seems, at best, the writer drew a loose outline that set the parameter but then, beyond putting people in a place with an objective, just let the cameras role, like a improv, which also made me question the nominations for acting. This will not be a popular review but in many ways it feels that to be unimpressed with this film is akin to calling out the nudity of the Emperor. Well, call me a philistine, but I rate this film a 5 (meh - with some technical excellence) out of 10. {Drama}",Roma

71,martimusross,A Shocking Fraud,1,27 February 2019,"This movie represents perhaps the greatest fraud ever perpetrated on the Oscars and the Baftas. It's selection is entirely Political and political and like the ""times up"" and ""me too"" movement last year or indeed the under-representation of BME winners the year before its elevation to greatness is based on the latest or ""worthy"" fashion trend. I am disgusted and betrayed that organisations whose raison d'etre is to recognise and promote excellence in the film industry would allow themselves to be so hood-winked and tainted by this calumny.I will now analyse this movie in detail under 7 headings.1, The Memories, The Director Alfonso Cuaron states the movies is a collection of his memories and the women who reared him. For this approach to have any meaning for the viewer the memory recalled must be either of emotional or historical significance to the formation of a specific character. No character had discernable definition, no emotion was conveyed and a memory of dog excrement or bad driving, disappearing bookcases or fireworks is of insufficient weight to convey meaning. I would go further that in the mundanity and rambling progression of this movie the ""events"" inserted were so contrived to provide a catalyst that I laughed in exasperation.2, The Characters, there was no character definition to define any specific character, there was no script to speak of to attach to any character that would display an emotional inner world, history or future. Moving from room to room cleaning and turning off lights is not acting, if it were so I would have earned at least two Oscars this morning. We were just shown the mundanity of feckless acts by ugly people who we cared not whether they lived or died. I vote for the latter. I had to laugh when the Director stated he went through countless villages auditioning thousands of women to find his ""Cleo"", my cleaner is available anytime WTF!3. The Corpus Christi Massacre, this was handled as a side-issue or even a non-issue, there was here finally a chance to say something by the Director, and yet the whole event was diluted by shopping for a cot and Cleo's waters breaking. If I were to choose a comparator perhaps it would be the absence of the French Revolution in a Jane Austin novel despite it occuring as a backdrop. The device of inserting incidents, the fireworks, the abandonment, the near drowning were introduced as catalysts for plot development but literally nothing followed, leading to frustration for the viewer. Any successful drama is the compression of reality over conflict here the drama was displayed practically in real time and therefore there was no compression and hence no drama.4. Toxic Masculinity, wow the same old cards, all men are losers, all men abuse and abandon women, the ""fictional"" sisterhood in a domestic setting (no such thing), the underpinning of a pseudo-reality where only women can be compassionate, only women own up to the responsibilities of child rearing. Give me a break, this is not toxic masculinity but strident feminist misandry with an agenda. There was nothing new here in this movie that wasn't said 20 years ago, and what there was handled badly. This movie was a setback for any feminist principles and they should be ashamed.5, The Cinematography, the black and white just underpinned a dreadful black and white world. Yes the tonal qualities of the images were good, but cinematography is a vehicle for the story and drama before us, much of its was delivered like a series of postcards, the camera moved with a lack of variety. Overall this was style over substance and certainly not worthy of an Oscar when compared to the Favourite or Bohemian Rhapsody.6. The Simplicity, we had lengthy views, panoramas, cleaning, driving , marching, water, the seaside, fireworks etc etc. So what! How does this entertain me in of itself, the answer is it doesn't. There was no tension or dramatic impetus, it had the feel of a screensaver or watching a spider build a web. Interesting for a minute and then what next. Within a movie every image much add to the plot, this series of images had no meaning or profundity and thus we just didn't care.7. The Score, these was no score we just had the irritating and haphazard sounds of humanity.In our age film is the new high-art of the 21 century, when news and opinion cannot be trusted film becomes pre-eminent in its power to shape and form public discourse. The Oscars and Baftas matter and the selection of this movie for honour brings these organisations into disrepute at a time when we all need to believe in the honest intentions of ""experts"".If there was an Oscar to be handed out it would go to Borras the dog as he told us in the yard repeatedly what he thought about this movie and he was right.",Roma
72,leftbanker-1,Higly Un-Entertaining and Morally Offensive,3,22 December 2018,"This film is sold as a glimpse of ""middle class"" life in Mexico. In fact, there wasn't much of a middle class in that era, not that there is much that passes for it today. I spent a year living with in a very similar household in Lima, Peru, when I was in an exchange program at university in 1980. This film brings back bad memories of the sad lives that domestic servants have in Latin America (I can't speak about other places).I'm way too much of a socialist not to be sickened by this ""nostalgic"" look at this demeaning way of life in which one group of humans are superior to another. The families treat their domestics like property. This same ruling elite have denied reproductive rights to their citizens ensuring that the cycle of ignorance and poverty continue, providing a steady flow of cheap help.If I were the king of the world (quite an irony for a socialist) I would force everyone to at least clean their own toilets every day.

76,proud_luddite,A superb final third,8,1 February 2019,"Early 1970s: In the Colonia Roma district of Mexico City, Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio) is an indigenous (Mixtec) Mexican. She is one of two live-in domestic servants who reside with a well-off family whose patriarch is a doctor. As the troubles of Cleo's personal life escalate, it is also clear that there is trouble within the family who employs her. ""Roma"" is based on childhood memories of director/writer Alfonso Cuarón.Cuarón certainly knows how to use a camera effectively whether it is movement, stillness, what to include in a frame, or how long to make it linger. His attention to detail is very evident. His scenes are wonderfully enhanced by his own beautiful black-and-white cinematography. The scenes on the downtown streets of the city truly stand out.The first two-thirds of the film seem somewhat ordinary although their subtleties are rich. The attitude of the family to their servants is sometimes condescending while at other times, it is clear that the servants are a part of the family. There are also some fascinating sidelines to Mexico's history of the time including indigenous land disputes, student protests, and a violent counter-protest movement.While the beginning and middle are good, it is not until the last third when the film really takes off with climactic scenes that derive strong emotions that linger well after the film. It was a challenge on whether to give the film a rating of 7 or 8 as its first two-thirds would have earned only 7. I settled on 8 as its last third is so powerful that what precedes it could be considered a build-up. Besides, the feelings last well after the movie's conclusion.And it's also worth noting that Aparicio more than lives up to the responsibility of the central role especially in a scene that takes place in a hospital.",Roma

This the film that Alfonso Cuaron never wants you to forget that he made. Fortunately, we won't. A technical visionary director in an intimate setting, with a story close to his heart, is something an audience from all corners of the world can look in wonder at.I realized I was watching something truly special within the first few minutes. We follow Cleodegaria, the indigenous maid, as she cleans around the sprawling upper-middle class house of a wealthy Mexican family. The camera follows her every movement and shows every last detail of her routine. In gorgeous black and white, Cuaron takes many of his cues from French New Wave cinema, and it's storyline is reminiscent of that era as well. Cleo is separated from her employers through class and race. But the human commonality of compassion, as we see by the end of the picture, pierces through those barriers. Cuaron also paints a dire picture of 20th century Mexico, through it's political turmoil that eerily resembles the upheavals we are seeing worldwide today.But make no mistake, Roma doesn't exist as a celebration of Mexico. It's rather, a celebration of humanity and all that binds together. We bleed the same blood, we cry the same tears, we love the same way. Nothing but love from me. Gracias, Aflonso.",Roma
80,rockman182,Roma (2018),8,24 November 2018,"I know this is coming to Netflix in a few weeks but the rave I've heard about it and being that this is Alfonso Cuaron's next project, I had to make sure to see it on the big screen. I loved Cuaron's last film. Gravity for me was a fantastic visual experience, as well as a emotionally gripping experience. Cuaron's handiwork behind the camera was on full display with that film. Here he comes with a Spanish spoken, black and white, Mexican film that is semi biographical. This film is fairly amazing, from start to finish. I think it excels its expectations and goes to show that Cuaron is one of the best directors on the scene.The film takes place in Mexico City in the early 70s, and is about a Mexican housemaid who takes care of a family of four children, along with their parents and maternal mother. The film shows her routines as the housemaid, her trials and tribulations at work and love, and ow her life changes when she becomes pregnant. The film stars a relatively unknown cast but has a primarily fantastic performance by Yalitza Aparicio as Cleo, the housemaid.From the opening scene of water washing tiles with the credits overlaying, you know you are in for an immense experience. Cuaron utilizes cameras set in place and slow pans to encompass the entire scope of the visual experience of the household and the daily tasks of Cleo. It seems routine at first but the build up throughout is an experience that keeps you watching every second. Cuaron has to be a contender for Best Director at the Academy Awards again as the camera work, cinematography, and sound effects are extremely vivid. Especially, the scenes with the wives in the films climax, lord.The film becomes an emotional experience as the film builds along. You can't help but have strong responses as we see what our protagonist must deal with. The film is set in a time with political unrest and that backdrop adds to the chaos of what occurs in Cleo's life. The film is full of themes and symbolism that could be analyzed in greater detail in a separate entry. There is just a lot that goes on in each sequence of the film. I think Gravity is my personal favorite, but Cuaron's best film has arrived, and I think we have a clear favorite this year. Watch Roma on the big screen if you can, its a cinematic experience tailored with passion by Alfonso Cuaron.8.5/10",Roma
81,Benjamin-M-Weilert,An artistic film that uses Cuarón's talents to say very little.,6,14 March 2019,"Don't get me wrong. I like Alfonso Cuarón's films. I liked his films before I even really knew who he was as a director. If anything, he's shown that he's the master of cinematography, especially in long takes that seem to pan through almost the entire film. He first showed this talent in Children of Men (2006) and continued to impress with this technique in Gravity (2013). While he's shown he has mastered the long take, his signature style is still on display in Roma (2018) through its numerous pans. That being said, I found the content of Children of Men and Gravity to be much more interesting than that of Roma.Cuarón pulls us into his Mexican roots in this film, choosing the early 1970s to set this ""slice of life"" tale. The problem is, while the film looks quite artistic, with the black-and-white aesthetic fusing nicely with the expert camera work (along with that weird costumed singer bit near the middle), there isn't much substance there. Put in another way: I didn't care for the characters. In Children of Men, humanity's survival is on the line. In Gravity, the impetus to return to Earth safely drives the story. In Roma, events just happen, and life goes on.I understand that there are some broader themes likely present in Roma, but I didn't particularly care about them, either. Perhaps it was the simplicity of its presentation that failed to grab my attention. Sure, I liked the little visual setups that led to somewhat amusing changes later on in the film. However, these felt more like a famous comedian winking at the audience without saying a word and expecting everyone to laugh. Perhaps I'm just not close enough to the culture represented here, but I didn't particularly care for this movie, and I instead look forward to whatever Cuarón's next project might be.An artistic film that uses Cuarón's talents to say very little, I give Roma 3.0 stars out of 5.",Roma
82,bankofmarquis,A lush and beautiful memory,9,16 January 2019,"Alfonso Cuaron - the magnificent Director from Mexico who directed such big Hollywood hits as HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN (the best HP flick, IMHO) and GRAVITY (one of the best films of 2013, IMHO) has made a little ""personal"" film that was financed and released by Netflix. Netflix, in their wisdom, realized they might have an Oscar contender on it's hands, so has released ROMA in limited release to Theaters (mostly Art Houses) and...in some instances...you can catch a 70mm print of this film. Or...you can watch it on your TV via your Netflix subscription.I would highly recommend checking this film out at your local movie theater house and, if you are lucky enough to have a theater that is showing the 70mm print, I would tell you to run...don't walk...to check this out.For ROMA is a beautifully filmed Black and White film, in Spanish (with English subtitles) that tells a very personal story of a family in Mexico City in the early 1970's - as seen through the eyes of their house maid. This story is based (according to what I have read) on Cuaron's own childhood and he has lovingly, beautifully recreated this world and populated it with some interesting characters/experiences.It is also languidly paced (read: slow) and - if I am honest about it - not much happens. So if you add languid pace with black and white photography with Spanish language (and English subtitles) with not much in the way of plot or action, your attention span will be stretched and, I'm afraid, if you're home, you will be tempted to be distracted by your phone, the dog, the dishes, a magazine, etc...And that would be a shame, for I fell in love with this film, the beauty of the cinematography and the slow pace of it all and I think you will too if you give it a chance.Cuaron, most certainly, will be nominated for an Oscar for his writing and directing of this piece - and I am sure that this film will be nominated for Best Picture (and deservedly so), but it is in two other places that I was entranced by ROMA. I have mentioned the first - the Cinematography. This film is a shoo-in for a Best Cinematography Oscar, the black and white is lush and rich throughout the film and adds to the memory-style idealized world that Cuaron has put on screen. So, the Best Cinematography Oscar should go to...Alfonso Cuaron.The other area that I am surprised to say worked very well for me is the performances of the cast, all Mexican actors, unknown to U.S. audiences. Standing out most notably are Marina de Tavira as the matriarch of the family, Senora Sofia and, most surprisingly, Yalitza Aparicio as the focal point of this film, Cleo. Her part is mostly mute (or at least mute for me, for I don't speak Spanish) so the emotions I felt coming from her were brought forth through her facial features, looks and reactions, much more than what she says. I would be fine with either of these two getting an Oscar nomination.Despite a slow start - and a slow pace throughout this film - and not much going on, I was entranced and enthralled by the world that Cuaron put on screen. A world that exists, mostly, in Cuaron's memory and that, now, exists for us to see in this wonderful film.Letter Grade: A9 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Roma

Then her water breaks on the floor in bed shop and she is rushed by the grandmother of her house and gives birth to a dead baby and you see doctor saying 123 ventilate about 4 times baby's dead. ............................................................................This is not the end a few month or weeks pass and she goes on holiday with mother and children and a there is a sub plot is the father has left mother I think you only see father about once. The children love the ocean and the maid does not and is forced to go in the sea to save the girl called Clio and on doing so manages to release the pain she had and breaks down crying in the arms of the family bonding with them. Now in the film she seem to have a new zest for life and that the end. The film is not challenging but rather dragged out and really does not tell the story in the usual way, but maybe that why people like it. I don't feel I care for the servant girl by watching this film or the family. -----------------------------------------------------Did any else think why is that guy dressed as a porcupine near a forest fire an accident waiting to happen, did he catch fire?. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------About 30 minutes of non-sense or more and I did not know why there was a riot in Mexico in 1970 nor why the guy needed to do martial arts when I was watching this movie, I thought maybe he did it to give himself a faster swing.

Fermín is a supporter of Luis Echeverría Álvarez and hes initials are seen in hill in scene where they are practising matial arts.In this sene three americans are seen and posibly on in c.i.a uniform. Then they switch to Zovek who was seen on t.v earleir in movie pulling car with teeth this guy was famous in mexico at the time and tells them the power of the mind over the body and shows them how to stand on on leg. Latter in movie Fermín is seen in student riot in Mexico City which was the Corpus Christi festival a sad day in mexicos history. This festival is the main plot of movie and makes this movie political story. The white family really don't mater and the fact she looses the baby seems to overshadow the film along with a her boyfriend naked doing matial arts with a shower rod. Their was also another side story of family of the house splitting up. The baby probably would have died regardles of her boyfriends action and this sene was shocking to watch and all this film will be remembered for, but as she said she did not want the baby. The family bonding over girls near death was a great sene and camera angles were good but this is just a side show.
The best scene was the car being parked in small garage trying to avoid dog mess.
There's a giant blue crab in Mexico called Puerto Ceiba - Cangrejopolis seen in the scene where they eat icecream.

86,tonypeacock-1,Cuarón's greatest film 'yet' deserves cinematic projection,10,25 July 2020,"Award-winning director in Netflix film presentation? The award winning director is Mexican Alfonso Cuarón. Director with a filmography that includes such varied and interesting films such as Y Tu Mamá También (2001), Gravity (2013) and Children Of Men (2006).This film is presented in a digital black and white that may be off putting to mainstream audiences but when you watch the film you will understand why it is used.The first few minutes of the film had me thinking such thoughts but the film grew on me.It is loosely based on Cuarón's childhood in the middle-class echelons of Mexico City. The film is set in the district of the city or Colonia Roma hence the title of the film.The film is a picture of Cuarón's memories that includes his family 'maid', family breakdown and the streets of his childhood.The film is set in 1971 and follows a period of a year in the life of said live-in maid Cleo (untrained actress Yalitzia Aparicio) and through her story of class difference in terms of language difference (Mixtec) and physical appearance compared to the white Mexican middle-class Antonio and Sofia and their four children.Cleo is shown falling pregnant, the father Fermín dumping her when he finds out and becoming more engrossed in the paramilitary group Los Halcones (The Hawks) who are shown in one scene repressing a student demonstration in Mexico City.
The stress of one such battle causes Cleo's waters to break and an emergency labour sequence.Antonio leaves Sofia with the children for a new life with a mistress.The detail that Cuarón puts into each scene is a joy. He had several roles in production including a Director of Photography credit.Some of his vision is lost when watching the Netflix stream on a small screen and the film ideally needs to be viewed on a cinematic projection.The film only had a limited theatrical run at mainly film festivals as it is a Netflix stream production for home viewing.If ever this film gets a theatrical run near you, get there!Winner of several Academy Awards and nominated for several more.

90,kjproulx,Storytelling at its Finest,10,15 December 2018,"Movies that are simply about life don't seem to come around often enough, so when one makes it into the limelight, it feels like something special if done correctly. Being in Spanish throughout the majority of the film, the sad truth is that most English-speaking American and Canadian citizens will probably be turned off, but if you're someone who doesn't mind watching a foreign film, I honestly don't think you'll find many films that are better than Roma in all of 2018. This film explores the story of a family in ways that I haven't seen present on the screen in quite some time. If you're a film fanatic, here's why (especially to you) I just can't recommend this movie enough.Following a family, as they deal with the hardships of dealing with the harsh realities of what some families go through, Roma focusses on their housemaid in Cleo. Becoming a very good friend of the family, her story is chronicled through the time she spends with them, just as much as she spends time with her friends as well. With a side story that had me sobbing throughout the third act, I truly can't remember when movie left my jaw on the floor in terms of an emotional impact. This is a film that cares solely about these characters and I was completely invested in each and every one of them.Written and directed by the incredibly talented Alfonso Cuarón, this film is showcased in a way that has the audience feel as though they're peering in on a family in crisis. This movie is an observation of family life and how rapidly it can change. Throughout horrible consequences or brief, happy moments, Alfonso Cuarón is able to display breathtaking cinematography that makes the movie itself feel like a character telling its own story. When a filmmaker can accomplish something like that, with long takes to further deepen the story, you know we have a gem on our hands. This man doesn't make enough films as far as I'm concerned and this is just another piece of impeccable entertainment that he can add to his resumé.Having never seen Yalitza Aparicio appear in anything before this appearance as the leading lady in Roma, I can confidently say that she should absolutely quit her day job if it isn't acting. Not only did she sell herself as this character in a way that stuck with me, but her expressions that range from fear to sadness, joy to love, and even devotion to commitment, her performance had my eyes glued to the screen for the full 135 minutes. Even though it may seem lengthy to some, I didn't think a single frame of this movie was wasted. Even throughout the slow moments, there were multiple levels of storytelling going on. When such a simple premise can be made to feel this epic in scale, I have nothing but unrequited love for it.In the end, Roma doesn't just have it all in terms of writing and directing, but those aspects are taken to new heights throughout these performances and the overall film that has incredible emotion throughout, ultimately builds to a couple of different climax's, and each of them feel either earned or absolutely shocking. As I mentioned, there was a specific moment toward the end of the movie where I just couldn't help but open my jaw wide. The payoff of one of the storylines is absolutely nothing what I expected. Roma is emotionally powerful from start to finish and I simply can't recommend it enough. Now streaming on Netflix of all places and probably up for many awards in the coming months, Roma is a true gem.",Roma
91,AhmedSpielberg99,A Daring Simple Film!,9,16 December 2018,"I admire movies of this kind; movies that feel simple and spontaneous, and have unrestrained plot. But I prepare myself before watching a movie of this kind; simply because I usually don't find myself connected emotionally with these movies. And I was ready to watch one of these art-house movies that I appreciate from the artistic and technical standpoint more than truly enjoying them. But Roma really took me off guard. Because I found out that Cuarón took this artistic approach in making this movie just to tie the somewhat loose plot of an ordinary story into an emphatic and heart-wrenching force.Cuarón's audiovisual motifs find their way across the film, not for the sake of showing his masterful skills, but to represent metaphorically, or sometimes literally, the characters' feelings, characteristics, nature, express their relationships to each other, and to mark major turning points in the story. When he doesn't use metaphors, Caurón plays, literally, with the contrast between background and foreground, and therefore allowing us to witness the currently unfocused on characters. This give me an opportunity to experience what all characters feel at every moment, and not loosing touch with any one of them at all. Furthermore, this gave the movie some kind of vividness that elevated the experience of watching it even more.By doing so, Cuarón didn't just give us a phenomenal piece of cinema, but he also subverted the art-house film genre, and proved that films can be as technically flawless and outstanding as they are thoroughly accessible and absorbing.The first act is a combination of simplicity and innovative visual storytelling.
The third act showcases Cuarón at the top of his visual craft, and that's when his signature long takes were prevalent, and each was as masterful as the last. But there's one in particular that sent chills down my spine, and kept me on the edge of my seat.
The second act, however, is more artistically enthralling than emotionally. Flawless from the narrative and technical, of course, aspects, but it's more ""Arthouse"" and meditative than anything else. It has some of the most beautiful shots, and moments, of the movie, though. And I really can't say that the movie lost me even for a split second.The story isn't the most original thing you'll ever encounter. Actually, the characters arcs are quite familiar, but that doesn't take away even the slightest hint of greatness from this masterwork due to the completely unorthodox and refreshing ways the film narrated, structured, shot, and edited in. That said, I couldn't help notice the stereotypical character arc of Sra. Sofía (Marina de Tavira's character) at the end of the movie. Cleo, on the other hand, has enough genuine nuances and twists in her character arc that breathed new life into the character, let alone Yalitza Aparicio's spellbinding performance. Nevertheless, Marina de Tavira's committed performance is nothing short of stellar.I hope Roma will jump start a career for Yalitza Aparicio. I already knew that many critics praised her performance in this movie, claiming that she gave one of the best performances of the year, but I really didn't expect that her performance will fascinate me like it did. For as much as I admired Hamilton Morris's performance in Sweet Country, or Brady Jandreau's in The Rider, I appreciated them for their naturalism and authenticity more than anything else. But as for Yalitza Aparicio, I really can't make up my mind whether her performance or Emily Blunt's in A Quiet Place is the best performance by an actress I've seen this year so far. And the same goes with these two movies they starred in as well.Alfonso Cuarón doesn't go with the flow neither by giving priority to politics over anything else, nor by squandering his creative vision for the sake of making Hollywood cash-grab blockbusters. He stays true to his idiosyncratic vision, and faithful to his jaw-dropping trademarks. And here he is making yet another masterpiece that is captivating, poignant, personal and subversive all at once. And easily one of the most accessible art-house films ever made!(9/10)",Roma
92,tm-sheehan,Netflix telemovie too long too boring,5,21 February 2019,"My Review/ Or really a mini essay on a film I just don't get?I can't remember ever seeing an Academy Award nominated movie, TEN in fact on a television screen a week before it probably will win all the major awards?I watched it again on Netflix tonight and wondered how it's even eligible? Netflix gave Roma a very limited theatrical release in November 2018 then began streaming it a month later , that must be a first for an Academy Award nominated best film.
I wanted to watch it again to see if I'd missed any of the great cinematic praise Roma has received.
I'm still of the opinion that its Netflix money and marketing that has catapulted this Netflix property and its director and stars to the dizzy heights of The Academy Awards to be held at The Dolby Theatre next Monday.As The Emperors New Clothes fable tells us if you're told by enough people that something is great or true you begin to believe it.I can see why director Alfonso Cuaron has been praised for recreating the experience of his childhood growing up in the Colonia Roma neighbourhood in Mexico City but he's not even a character in it? I give credit where due as the camerawork is impressive , especially in the street scenes , on a television screen anyway.BUT! let's get real here ,does an Upstairs Downstairs tale of a young servant who spends her days picking up dog shit for her disgruntled surly Very unpleasant employee and on her day off goes to the Cinema, sleeps with a guy on the first date and isn't fazed by this Willy waving martial Arts maniac dancing around the bed before sex enough to say no thanks and is understandably distressed when the idiot takes off and rejects her.Of course she gets pregnant on the first date and without giving any plot away, I can't really as I truly lost the plot in this movie.The acting is convincing Yalitza Aparicio plays Cleo the servant and is nominated along side Glenn Close and Olivia Coleman but it's her very first movie and is this movie acting or a documentary star turn first effort?
The Political climate of the time in Mexico obviously was very volatile but none of this is explained and the Guerrilla training scenes only explain what a drop kick Cleo's taste in boyfriend is.
The violent scenes that follow in the department store are ironic and improbable to say the least.I'm very tough on this movie I know because I realise my taste in movies can be very different to others and I respect people seem to love this movie .
At least I'm saying why I find this 135 minute telemovie unworthy of the Best Picture, Best Director , and definitely not Best Actress Academy award next Monday I wouldn't even give it Best Foreign Movie , The Polish movie Cold War to my mind is a superior movie.",Roma
93,skepticskeptical,A black and white world made better without men?,6,17 December 2019,"I was excited to watch Roma, as I love black and white films. This one is beautifully shot, comprising mostly long, slow, meditative pans. The moral of ¨the story¨, to the extent that there is one, seems to be that the world would be better without men. Seems like a strange message, and it probably would not have worked if the film had been directed by a female, who would have been accused of being a ball-busting man hater. Since Roma was directed by a man, however, people seem to be ignoring this aspect of the film altogether.I enjoyed watching this creation as a piece of visual art. Even the omnipresent matte gray dog poop in the foyer failed to look repulsive, as it does in technicolor. Each screen shot was like a well-composed photograph, but the story was considerably less compelling. This is a world in which color and men have been removed, and the survivors are happier as a result.I am somewhat surprised by the avalanche of awards heaped upon Roma, which may have something to do with the currently fashionable ¨me too¨ movement. I predict that this film will undergo critical reevaluation in the decades to come.",Roma

95,MrDHWong,A touching personal story from the acclaimed director,8,23 December 2018,"Roma is a drama film written and directed by Alfonso Cuarón (Gravity, Children of Men). Told primarily from the perspective of a single housemaid, it is a touching personal story from the acclaimed director.In 1970, Cleodegaria ""Cleo"" Gutiérrez (Yalitza Aparicio) works as a live-in housemaid for a middle class family in the Mexican suburb of Roma. Despite the family's ups and downs as well as her own personal problems, Cleo is always there to help out and put other's needs above her own.Poignant and down-to-earth, Roma's realistic approach to story telling leaves a lasting impression on the viewer thanks to director Alfonso Cuarón's own personal take on the source material. If there's one thing we can learn from Cuarón's filmmaking, it is that he is master of cinematography. The beautiful lingering shots of the 1970s Mexican streets and beaches firmly establish the atmosphere of that particular era and they help give the film a unique artistic integrity not often seen nowadays. In addition to this, the film is shot in black and white, which gives it a somewhat documentary-like feeling. Overall, this may not be for everyone but anyone interested in films about Mexican life from decades past will surely be entertained.I rate it 8/10",Roma
96,Alexander_Blanchett,Not as captivating as expected but still a very good film,8,14 December 2018,"It was a nice personal story by the brilliant Alfonso Cuaron. A personal tale that invites us to Mexico in the 70s and showing us two different lives that dont seem to be too different from each other, although on the surface they appear to be.
To be honest, I liked the film but I dont think it is the second coming of Christ like many folks treat it to be. You can perfectly soak into that world and kind of spend the year with the characters but I think I related less to it than most people did.
The acting was very solid, especially lead actress Yalitza Aparicio is great and gives a touching performance that really goes under your skin at times. Marina de Tavira was also memorable.
The true star of the film is Cuaron himself tho. A multitask talent who was involved in most aspects of the film. The screenplay was very well written and the characters development good. The direction was quite solid as you really never knew where the film is going to.
The best aspects were the cinematography, which is among the best of the year and the production design which was amazing as well.
There were some lengths in my opinion that hurt the experience a little. But as an homage to Cuaron' s youth it is a film you can easily respect.",Roma

Yes, Roma doesn't have the most immersive story, but the camerawork makes up for it in some regards. It almost becomes a character itself in the film. While Roma likely won't go down as an all time great among screenplays, its cinematography and direction will be long remembered.",Roma

Whether I was watching someone park a car or fight a fire or wade into the ocean, it was absolutely breathtaking. In many ways, that was enough to keep me watching and caring. The protagonist's journey mattered, and the city's journey mattered. The care with which the movie was shot made that impossible to miss. But I always stayed slightly distant too. I was observing how the story was told rather than being sucked into the story itself. There were literally central characters whose names I never learned and whose fates felt less than important as a result. Was it well done? Unquestionably. But was it a great story? I would say mostly. The people in it felt real. Their city felt real. The moments felt real. And every scene was shot like life depended on the outcome. The end result was gorgeous, even if I wanted a bit more drama.",Roma
100,elicopperman,Unconventionally Written Flick Based on the Life of its Director,8,28 December 2018,"This year, the director of Children of Men and Gravity, Alfonso Cuaron, made a film in his homeland of Mexico entitled Roma. What makes this film pretty notable amongst his other work is that this is a very personal flick for the guy, considering that it is set in the 1970s, the decade he grew up in. In fact, the film is named after the Colonia Roma in Mexico City, so one can tell how nostalgic this must have been for the director. But how does it work as a whole?The film revolves around the hard life of a live-in housekeeper named Cleo, who works for an upper-class family. That's mainly it, and truth be told, the non-linear narrative works in its favor. At its core, Roma is about the hardships of living poor in a country that went through many struggles and riots around said time. Cleo is a very sympathetic character given what goes on in the feature, and Yalitza Aparicio did a great job selling her intentionally insecure presence to resonate with the tumultuous tone of the feature. Even at that though, there are as many humorous moments as there are somber ones, making any given scene appropriately played out depending on the situation.The cinematography is another added bonus, even with the film being shot in black & white. In addition to the calm and brisk feel of the town, there are plenty of long establishing shots that help convey what is going on much better than if there were a quick cut every ten seconds. Probably the highlights in terms of the filmmaking aspect are the scenes with so much activity going on, especially when the family visits their caucasian cousins where so much personality bursts out of the screen. For a film made on a relatively low budget, the amount of effort that was put into it really makes us feel like we're experiencing pure Mexico. It's great when the atmosphere elevates the film's story much more than expected, especially when there is no cohesive plot.All in all, I definitely give Roma a recommendation for its simple albeit unpredtitcable non-linear narrative that details the life of people growing up through numerous trials and tribulations. Whether or not you can get into unconventionally crafted films like this, it's at least worthy to view the emotions of each given character, especially the children, whom are very endearing when they need to be. It might not be everyone's cup of tea, but for a feature that's mainly meant to show more than necessarily tell, it pulls off the job quite well.",Roma
101,garethcrook,"When I see films like this, it makes me wonder why they ever bothered inventing colour film.",9,2 January 2019,"When I see films like this, it makes me wonder why they ever bothered inventing colour film. There's so much depth, the frame just sucks you in. The camera movements simple, but so effective as they drift around suburban Mexico City, it's streets and it's slums. There's no hurry, in the story, the camera, the cut. It's a breath of fresh air. Time works differently here and it's easy to be fooled with the lack of colour that this was shot in the 70s where the story is set instead of today. It's a work of cinematic beauty depicting social and political upheaval, but there's a purity to it, with a feeling that nothing's added without purpose. Music only if it's in the scene, otherwise only voices, sometimes raised, but often calm. Dogs barking, birds singing, the camera lingering on both the good and the inexplicably bad. Heart warming and breaking. Good things happening to bad people and vice versa, but it's the grey area in between that offers hope. The world is not black and white. This is beautiful.",Roma
102,ronakkotian,Alfonso Cuarón's personal work of art,9,9 September 2021,"Alfonso Cuarón is one of my favourite filmmakers working today. He displays such flair with the camera and the stories he tells. With Roma, he has made his most personal and honest film yet.Roma shows us a year in the life of a middle-class family's maid in Mexico City during the early 1970s.What I genuinely love in Alfonso Cuarón's films apart from the story is the way he uses the camera. Not only do the long takes he does look incredibly impressive but it feels like a character itself. Cuarón focuses on the immersive quality of films and the way he blends the camera into scenes of action and emotion brings us into the film's world and leaves us entranced till the very end. His latest film, Roma, is a prime example of this. Being his own cinematographer, Cuarón uses stunning long/medium shots panning around the location without breaking the take for extended periods of time, providing a transcendent experience like no other. Told through the perspective of Cleo, Cuarón takes us through her struggles and hardships as well as the family's she works for and the city in general. His moving camera here takes upon the role of the audience and guides us through the scenarios as if we were witnessing it first-hand. What adds to the immersion is the amazing sound design. The sounds heard from the background of every shot builds to create a natural environment that captures the raw intensity or drama displayed by the visuals. I wish I saw this in cinemas to get the full effect of the sound design because it's that good.There's no doubt that Roma is one of the best shot films I've seen. Aside from capturing the troubles these characters go through and the turmoil the city is in, the intricacy of those shots are impressive in itself. There are scenes involving hundreds of extras with stuff going on in the background and it's such a feat for the eyes. It's no wonder Alfonso Cuarón won Best Director. Every single performance in Roma is fantastic. Yalitza Aparicio is phenomenal as Cleo. She gives such a natural and believable performance that it's crazy to think that this is her first time acting. There are some scenes that demand a lot from her but she pulls them off brilliantly. Marina de Tavira was fantastic in the supporting role and the children acted very well.Roma is yet another fantastic Alfonso Cuarón film. It's a nice change of pace from him and felt very special considering how intimate it felt to him. Cuarón displayed top-notch filmmaking once again and gave another reason as to why he's such a great director.",Roma

104,andrewroy-04316,"An indisputable technically impeccable work, but this very realistic depiction of everyday life feels just that: mundane",7,15 December 2018,"I feel very similarly to Roma as I did to Dunkirk, though they are extraordinarily different films and subject matters. Both are made by directors I love, and both I appreciate the constant technical brilliance shown in each scene. Ultimately in both cases I was emotionally detached and thought it was a good movie but not at all a memorable one. There is no doubt that Roma leans entirely on Aparicio, and she knocks it out of the park. The subtlety to her acting and her body language and uses of silence are excellent. As is Cuaron's hallmark, the cinematography is excellent, and particularly the 360 pan with Cleo turning off the lights was well shot. The childbirth and ocean scenes were enrapturing and tense. The scene in the furniture store was my favorite of the movie - the intersection of the small private world we've seen with the family and the student protests outside was well shot and executed.
I can intellectually appreciate all the things Roma has to offer, and can understand why some think it's a masterpiece and the best of the year. If it emotionally connected with people and had them crying at the end, I just didn't have that experience. It's a very well done slice of life movie that focuses on appreciation for a maid who does everything for a family, and in going through her daily life we see other major events unfold. But despite consistently great acting and cinematography and several really good scenes, the vast majority of the movie varied from smart but detached filmmaking to mundane, every day life. Maybe the black and white and Spanish elements also contributed, but I just didn't particularly enjoy most of the individual scenes. Reflecting on it as a full piece and the motifs that we see throughout allow me to enjoy and appreciate it more, but while watching it I just wasn't invested. I'm glad most love it and think this is just me not connecting with the film, but while Roma is a technical marvel, it was just a fine story.",Roma

Certainly if you are a fan of Iron Man, Transformers, The Fast and the Furious, Avengers or Black Panther you're not going to enjoy this film, most likely. It's just too close to the truth and it cuts too close to the Bone. It is just too realistic.This is a stunning character study, this is a film that completely captures a time and a place, this is a great bit of story telling, with a tremendous production that looks and feels like 1970 - 1971.

not a happy film. To the naysayers, I say stick with the Avengers. This film is not an amusement park ride, it is a slice of life, shot arrestingly, and with great power.",Roma

""Roma"" is not one of those movies. Yes, the film-making itself is wonderful and the acting, especially by the inexperienced lead, is impressive, but most of it is rather boring. There are some emotional moments toward the end, but many viewers may not make it that far with their eyes open. Movies about 'normal life' are generally not very exciting, as 'normal life' is rarely exciting. And the way this film is edited, you often feel like you missed something because of the quickness with which scenes change. Perhaps one has to be part of the Mexican culture to really enjoy this, but I have to wonder if the current state of politics in the U.S. didn't have something to do with its nomination for an Academy Award. Frankly, I don't know that it should even have been nominated for best foreign film. Neither my wife not I felt this film lived up to the hype.",Roma

109,sweidman-28016,Heartbreaking Movie of the Year,8,10 January 2019,"Roma Review:Roma is a Mexican film directed and written by Alfonso Cuarón depicting a year for a maid and the middle class family she works for in Mexico City in the 1970s. This is the foreign film that everyone has been talking about. I haven't heard this much buzz about a foreign film since Pan's Labyrinth and Amour. I saw this for the first time about a month ago and just recently watched it again. I think this is an excellent film with a great story and wonderful performances. Yalitza Aparicio is absolutely amazing with her first acting performance ever. She's been getting Oscar buzz but I don't think she'll make it into Best Actress. She shows so much emotion and there's so much development through her heartbreaking story. Yalitza is the main star of the movie and everyone is talking about her. Alfonso Cuarón does amazing with this movie. He did so much with it consisting of writing, directing, cinematography, editing, and producing. He will most likely win Best Director for the Oscars as he did for the Golden Globes. Screenplay is hard to say but I don't think he'll win. The cinematography is beautiful! It's all in black and white but every shot was thought through carefully and shot beautifully. It will for sure win Best Cinematography. The story conveys so many emotions with a heartbreaking final act. I don't want to give much away because it's so good and shouldn't be spoiled. The movie is a little long and some scenes could've been shortened down a bit. If you have time and have Netflix, check it out. Definitely check this one out before the Oscars.My Grade: A",Roma
110,JakeBrinkman,The director's most self-righteous piece of garbage,1,31 October 2019,"Nowadays, very little in the filmmaking world is more pretentious than making a black and white film. Granted, there are some who use it very well by reserving it for flashbacks, highlighting the most important items on screen using extreme color contrasts, or to draw focus to a significant event. But Roma isn't any of those. In fact, it's even the opposite of that, with the worst case being the only flash of drama in the entire script barely visible in the pitch black foreground while our eyes are drawn to watch a movie screen instead of the actual important events. Roma is in the pretentious category of directors who aren't capable of defending artistic decisions, so as soon as they receive any criticism they automatically default to attack the critic by saying they're too inferior to appreciate black and white. No, you're just a bad director.Not only is this director pretentious, he also strongly believes he is an artist. This is all too apparent as he constantly shoves ""art"" in our faces with incessant long shots and rotating pans. Long shots aren't impressive for the sake of being a long shot. They're only impressive when a considerable number of choreographed events take place during the long shot. Roma has exactly zero of those because every long shot has virtually nothing happening on screen. The horizontal rotating pans are also terribly choreographed with the object of interest continuously on the verge of being panned out of the shot. Also, so many of them in quick succession is enough to make anyone watching on a big screen sickeningly dizzy. Every scene in this film makes it painfully apparent how proud of himself the director is, like a child proud of their stick figure drawing.Enough about the director, let's talk about the plot. Nearly nothing of interest happens for the first half of the film, and to make matters worse, it's written so badly that it never piques even the smallest bit of interest. Then in the second half, far too much happens way too quickly. It was as if the writer realized the first half was terribly boring, but he didn't know how to fix it other than throwing in random ""exciting"" and edgy events with complete disregard to how the events fit into the plot. The horrible writing speaks volumes about the screenwriter's talent. Unsurprisingly, the director is also the screenwriter. Surprisingly, the director/writer is Cuaron.If I didn't know any better, I would have guessed this movie was made by a brand new director who doesn't realize the arrogance he has in his talents is very undeserved. Literally the only good thing about this movie is the camera picture quality, which only requires money and no talent. I'm honestly surprised that Cuaron was even capable of making such an all-around horrible disasterpiece.",Roma
111,user-651-726996,I Just Can't Bare It Anymore,2,12 February 2019,"A film that definitely needs to be embedded into any film school curriculum for it's sheer making and nothing else but as an audience, oh please spare me.The writing was more of a visual medium of a book. The conversion from the bookish story to the film needs elimination of detailed characteristics or moments. The screenplay is average if not good but definitely not excellent and the story is so very cliche that I feel the Hollywood is going down with selection of films into the Oscars. But wait, the film itself is of a maid and every little detail matters but if so, that should have been a documentary and we have seen, read, heard such cliche stories in the past. What's new in this film is nothing. Watching this lady's daily life is like anyone watching their daily life from another point of view. Why would you do that.Show Hollywood a bit of dirt from South America or Asia and they'll go gaga over how bad the life in these places are which in fact was made by the lust of the dumb Europeans who messed up the sanctity of the world.This film is very overrated as a film but in individual departments like cinematography, lighting, art, and costumes it excels well but making such a big deal of it is a tad too much.10 minutes into the film and I couldn't already bare it anymore. Horribly wastage of so much of money. Skip this film and you will miss nothing. Though it was a very plain below average emotional journey, it was in fact a torture of a boring kind.",Roma
112,TaylorYee94,"Critics can ruin a director, moviegoers, and the whole industry",6,29 June 2021,"Typical routine for a director to waste the film because he or she aims it for Oscars not for the audience. Cuaron's last five or six movies drew many viewers and were critically acclaimed, and his next goal would be an award. However, 'Roma' is unbearably slow-paced. I understand that abstract images and symbolism are critics' favorites, but they are just means, not the goal of the movie. For example, 'Minari' and 'Frances Ha' share similar characteristics with this one. The whole movie follows ordinary life of a person or a family very plainly, does not have many dramas or ups-and-downs, and embodies images and scenes that inspire bigger stories or messages. So, I become patient even though the movie is a little slow because during those times my mind and thoughts just flow endlessly to understand what the director intended. However, scenes in 'Roma' which is supposed to be artistic (I guess) seems sudden, unfit, and extra. For example, scenes like Cleo singing looking at the camera, Cleo cleaning the dog poop, and a wrestler doing yoga, and even the forest burning (which is huge event) does not mean anything or connect to something in the movie even though those scenes take a long time in the movie. Every scene and image matters and tells something in great movies, but gosh, 'Roma' wastes a lot of them.Cuaron uses water as as a tool to signal the negative things, which is very unusual and unique. Water often symbolizes the beginning, birth, refreshment, and something positive. In 'Roma', the city is filled with puddles, and it rains in the city when the bad things are about to happen. In contrast, when the family and Cleo went to country for Christmas, the woods are burnt down. Immediately fire is associated with destruction and disaster, but Cleo says it is the sight and the smell of her home. All the water expressed in the movie feels sticky and muddy, for example, in the scene where maids clean the roads in the beginning because of the sight and the sound. Therefore, when I see her water broke, and the camera focuses on the water (this one feels very sticky too), I can predict some bad things will happen. At the end, yet, water becomes the catalyst for stronger bond and emotional cleansing, and the feeling of water changes to be fresh and strong again. Paradoxical juxtaposition of water and fire and of begging and the end is interesting to watch.",Roma
113,TheDonaldofDoom,Roma isn't just pretty-looking,10,22 December 2018,"There's a reason Roma has received more praise than any other film this year. Every shot is beautifully shot and is full of details that make it feel simultaneously real and poetic. That's the real magic of Roma I think, how Cuaron has created a realistic experience that is also highly stylistic. It's incredible. From the start, when we see water spill over the floor and a plane reflected in it, we know we're in for a treat.Cuaron's characteristic long takes are a big part of what makes the visuals so special. They allow you to marvel at the framing and the detail of the world. There are few close-ups. This type of visual storytelling doesn't tell you what to look at or what to think. Some, used to Hollywood hand-holding, might not like this. One of the most powerful scenes is seeing Cleo give birth to a stillborn child. The whole thing is presented on one shot, with no time jumps, immersing the viewer with its realism. The still shots also heighten family drama to another level. The mother telling the kids their father isn't going to come back is such an emotionally engaging scene in part because of the fact that it is a several-minute scene in one take.Most beautiful are the scenes simply showing the city and the landscape, such as where the camera tracks Cleo walking down a sidewalk. The dirt, the bustle and the atmosphere are all captured perfectly in these slice-of-life scenes, which display a great attention to detail. You can see so many things as the camera moves past, a woman shaking out an awning and so on. You also see social disparities communicated through the details.While the political turmoil is not the main focus, it is present. The Corpus Christi Massacre is shown with horrible realism. There is no graphic violence here, just a display of what this chaos had on ordinary people. This is far more distressing than watching graphic gore.It's not just the visuals that have led to Roma's praise. Cuaron has a way of expressing his memories of Mexico in a way that is realistic and objective, yet poetic and personal. The wide shots don't tell you what to think, yet they give you so many things to think about. The character drama is purposeful in its build-up, regularly refusing to be sensationalist and soapy. Someone used to lesser films might expect more outbreaks of violence and shouting. Instead, the character drama is handled in a defter way.The forest fire scene is one of the most controversial in Roma. It's undeniably well shot, lodging itself into your mind. What is the meaning of the singing man in the suit? Is his apparent lack of care about the destruction going on around him a symbol of the zero stakes he has in the rich world he isn't really a part of? Cleo joins in fighting the fire while the man is the single person who doesn't. Not only does this scene tell us about the unnamed man but it also tells us about Cleo.And Cleo is undoubtedly the focus of the film. She is the character whose story sweeps you into 1970s Mexico. It is remarkable that despite her status as a servant, she is a bigger part of the family than the father. Many scenes show her special qualities, yet she is a nuanced, remarkably fleshed out character. The conflict between her role as a part of the family and her separate life is the main source of tension in the film. This conflict is itself used to comment on inequality in Mexico as the father of her child abandons her at the first opportunity, leaving her in a desperate situation where if she has her child she will be unable to continue her job the same way as before but as a result will be unable to care for it. The fact that it ends up being stillborn allows her to evade the full implications of that question, but the fact that she had been hoping for it to be stillborn is a twisted commentary on the harsh reality of life if you are poor.Despite the tragedy, Cleo's failure to build her own family makes a resolution to her inner conflict possible. It doesn't happen straight away; at first she is at a distance from the kids at the beach. But in the powerful climax, when she is needed, she makes her choice. It's a masterful ending to a masterful character study.",Roma
114,david-meldrum,A film inviting us to notice the people and place we otherwise overlook and take for granted,9,23 February 2019,"If you really want to know the truth about person, ask the apparently insignificant. It's said that legendary British football manager Sir Alex Ferguson knew the names of all the staff at his club - cleaners and all - and greeted them by name when he passed them in a corridor. Hence the fierce loyalty to him found throughout the organisation. Those we may not notice, notice much,Roma is a film about the people and the things we may not notice - but who notice much. On the face of it, this is a simple story. A year in the life of Cleo, a domestic worker for a middle class family in Mexico City, 1970 (the film's title is taken from a district of the city). The director is Alfonso Cuarón (he also edits, writes and is cinematographer - it really is his film), director of Gravity, the best Harry Potter film (Prisoner of Azkaban) and Children of Men. It's his first film set in his native Mexico for many years, and he's said that much of the film is taken from his own childhood memories; the maid he knew growing up is a significant figure in his life, who appears in bit parts in some of his films.This is an apparently slow, patient film - but there is a good reason for this. The pace allows us to see what Cleo sees - Cuarón's camera lingers on scenes for longer than would be normal, allowing us to observe details that would otherwise be overlooked. We see the long process of Cleo switching on all the lights in the house, an essential process, but one otherwise unobserved and unnoticed in the execution.This is also a film about women picking up the pieces of men's lives, literally and metaphorically. The man of the household scolds Cleo for not picking up the mess from the dog - another member of the house starved for affection and begging to be noticed. Cleo grows close to a man, Fermin, who is training in martial arts. The morning after a night together, he is training in front of her, naked. Afterwards he sits on the bed, back turned to her, pouring out his childhood suffering to her. It becomes tragically inevitable later that she is left to pick up the pieces of his relational failures alone. As the woman of the house pointedly says to her ""No matter what they tell you, we women are always alone."" Again, the camera lingers, long and patient, the better to heighten the impact - like happens in a much later, even more tragic scene; forcing us to watch we wish would never happen. It's achingly moving, and strikingly intimate.Not unlike Moonlight, it seemed to me that water is a key part in the connecting tissue of this film; we open on a long shot of a tiled floor being washed by the soapy water of Cleo's work; the film's revelatory and emotional climax is a sea scene where unvoiced shame is finally given expression. Is it a rebirth? By the end it certainly feels as if Cleo, and the family for which she works, has undergone a kind of rebirth - but the implication may be that, for her at least, little actually changes.Roma is a rich, eloquent, beautiful film that settles gently in the memory, shots and feelings and ideas taking up long-term residence. It seems likely to repay repeated rewatching, enabling us to notice more that we would otherwise have brushed over. It's slow, lingering pace allows us to feel as if we are walking with Cleo, learning from her, seeing her, truly noticing her.Roma is transcendent experience that invites to notice those we hurry past and take for granted. It is not a film to be forgotten or ignored.",Roma
115,joelwatchesmovies,Exquisitely directed and wonderfully acted character study,9,29 December 2018,"I nearly cried during the first shot and it was the credits over a damn floor. Cuarón's direction is exquisite in its patience, thoughtfulness, and attention to detail with long tracking shots, intimate close-ups, busy backgrounds, and remarkable soundscapes. Beyond its aesthetic beauty though, it's poignant in its ability to tell a story (Aparicio's great turn helps of course)-this one being a powerful character study about finding strength and peace amidst chaos (see Cleo's one-leg stand).",Roma
116,LloydBayer,"A meticulous crafted film that transcends stereotypical bias on gender, class and race.",9,16 December 2018,"If you were asked to tell a story to a bunch of strangers, what would it be about? A colourful and grand tale of adventure, or a more somber and subjective story you would rather not talk about? Mexican writer/director Alfonso Cuaron's Roma is one such story where ordinary characters find themselves in situations so commonplace, you could say these situations occur to a million people every day. But if a thing of beauty is a joy forever, Roma will be remembered for a long time, simply due to the immersive nature in which this story is told.Known for his sweeping long takes, Cuaron's opening shot is just over four minutes long of a driveway being washed with soap and water. For a Netfilx release, there is an ever present danger when watching this film on TV or a handheld device, in that viewers could be tempted to fast forward seemingly unimportant segments through the course of the film. A little bit of patience will go a long way in rewarding the viewer with not just one, but two incredibly emotive moments that are both staggering to take in. For this to achieve full impact, we are first conditioned by the mesmerizing nature in which the story unfolds. When the camera finally lifts up, we see the person cleaning the driveway. She is the domestic help to an upper middle-class family in the titular Mexican city. Though indigenous, Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio) is very much part of the family she serves, yet her place as the help is clearly defined. Cleo's Caucasian employers are Sofia and her husband Antonio, their four children, and the children's grandmother. But there's trouble brewing in the family. Antonio's unexplained and lengthy travels (as a doctor) often leaves Sofia and the kids in a state of dysfunction. From regularly cleaning up dog poop to comforting the kids when they fight, Cleo is eager to help out in every way possible. All this changes the day Cleo learns she is pregnant. Worse, the egocentric would-be-father wants nothing to do with it.From Children of Men in 2006 and Gravity in 2013, Cuaron's nuance is in the way his characters are subjected to an impending crisis and the chaotic nature of said crisis. Roma has a lot of that crisis, but this time Cuaron is invoking a very personal story in what has been referred to as a semi-biographical episode during his upbringing. There is both a clear adoration and tribute to the women who raised him, but it's the manner in which they are presented that makes this film more of a memoir than a conventionally told narrative. After an hour or so of runtime, it becomes clear that there is not much of a plot, but a series of events strung together like sequences from a dream. This is where the film gets its heft. Circa early 1970s, Mexican socio-political events unfold in several frames, but mainly in the background. Like a renaissance painting, there is so much happening on almost all corners of the screen that it's easy to lose track of the strong bond forming between Cleo and the family she serves - Testament of which lies in the last fifteen minutes of the film, or the second of two powerfully crafted moments in the story; Powerful and moving, and all without a musical score or even the expressive sound of a violin.Presented in crisp, clean, 65mm black and white, this is also Cuaron serving as cinematographer for the first time. The result is a rich, visually stunning array of compositions filled with jaw dropping texture and depth. Coupled with Cuaron's signature long takes and stupendously juxtaposed satire, we are drawn into an entire world made with gorgeous micro-macro detail. But it's a world we watch objectively and from the sidelines. Perhaps that is part of the point of this film - a monochromatic introspection that transcends stereotypical bias on gender, class and race. Aparicio (in her debut role) conjures this feeling in Cleo with remarkable realism. It's in the way she looks, talks, and nurtures the family. It's in the way she mothers those kids as her own. It's in the way she is needed but also taken for granted. Yet, when it's her turn to receive help, all she has is us looking back in awe but also suffering with her. In any other film, all this would be mere melodrama but with Cuaron's as the auteur, Roma is a beautiful film crafted with meticulous detail. With limited release in cinemas, most people will be limited to watching this film on a Netflix streaming device. That shouldn't be a problem when the best part of this film is its soul and not its size.",Roma

In Alfonso Cuaron's 'Roma' - a tale of the hard times for a housemaid in 1970s Mexico City, this comes through loud and clear, as we follow the trials of Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio) as she experiences everything from heartache to sexism to loss.Despite all the many accolades it's received, 'Roma' is not for everyone. The story is very linear, and it feels sort of like a home movie. Cleo is seen as an important yet hardly respected member of an upper-middle class family, as she does everything from clean the walkways to hang the laundry to take care of the young children, all while trying to have a life of her own. Of course, things take a downward turn (why wouldn't they, given the serious subject matter), and we see Cleo needing to overcome nearly insurmountable obstacles.While the story is somewhat basic and the acting is strong but nothing spectacular, 'Roma' is special thanks to the film techniques Cuaron uses. The Oscar-winning cinematography is amazing, showing the rustic beauty of Mexico City, and the fact that it was shot in black-and-white also gives the film a dated feeling.'Roma' is a Netflix original film that shows there is a lot still to come from the company.",Roma
119,markgorman,First 80 minutes 1/10. Last 50 8/10.,5,9 January 2019,"In the light of today's BAFTA nominations I had to pull my socks up and watch Roma.I started it before Christmas but I wasn't in the mood, it seemed a little dull at the time. But that was probably the time of year I thought.Nope.Tonight I endured its full effect. All 135 minutes of it.The first 80 made some of the French New Wave's slower stuff seem like Prodigy videos.But it got better.Seriously, I have had more fun in my first job, in which I spent 72 hours extracting staples from booklets.It is colossally slow.Literally NOTHING happens.We see a lot of planes fly overhead and we see a lot, and I mean a LOT, of dogs wandering aimlessly; farm dogs, stray dogs, domestic dogs, stuffed dog heads (that was a good bit). The star dog defecates in an unprecedented manner.It takes us through Cleo's - the main protagonist - pregnancy, seemingly in real time.This is not new territory for Alfonso Cuaron.

Is. A. Little. Bit. Boring.But Roma takes boring to Golgothan proportions, to an art form that has no equal. We're talking stumbling into monochrome art films in art galleries that you walk out of, relieved that you aren't obliged to sit through any more, after about 12 seconds.But, heavens above, after about 75 minutes suddenly a great 50 minute featurette emerges from this torpid cocoon and transmogrifies into what a cinematic treasure.It's bewildering.We're talking games of two halves here like no other. It's like a football match that's 0-0 at half time with no shots on target, no corners, throw-ins, bookings.No anything,.Followed by the first third of the second half with more of the same, until six substitutions are made simultaneously and the match ends 7 all.The transition really is that dramatic.I won't bore you with the plot (there is none) or the technical details (Cuaron did everything except dolly grip operator - and I'll tell you what, the Dolly Grip was a busy bunny as Cuaron has more pan shots than a series of Jamie Oliver TV shows).Cuaron LOVES A PAN SHOT!So, do yourself a favour.

120,eagandersongil,The grandeur of the common,9,8 March 2019,"""Rome"" expresses in its technique the purest freshness of cinema by demonstrating the magnificent magnitude of the conidian intertwined with drama and despair, it is a punch in the stomach that gets stronger due to its intrinsic beauty, an artistic expression financed by Netflix and directed by Cuaron, Mexican director multi awarded by other works, such as ""gravity"" and ""Sons of hope"".""Rome"" has a surgical script and almost imperceptible, since we are placed under an unusual point of view of the film, the domestic maid, and from it we form our painting of the work, we gain experiences, absorbing the dramas, shocks and ecantos, always with a linear narrative that cares little about rhythm or entertaining.To speak about the moral of his script and work is almost inadmissible, since Rome contemplates a vision and several ramifications and in this point he can be magical, because we do not feel the lack of deepening on plots touched, since we are confined only to the eyes of Cleo and his little world, that is, Cuaron's proposal to explain his past memories works perfectly, and we are so delighted with the film of life that little details no longer matter.In technical terms, ""Rome"" is exquisite, and it is difficult to speak of all its virtues in a single text, but we can not fail to mention the most imposing points, beginning with his photography, which can exhaust something unique and almost philosophical, since greatness of the same contrasts in simple scenes of the daily life, it is like expressing the grandiose of daily life, an odyssey of something mundane, and how often are we just taking care of our lives while magnificent things happen around? the photography of Rome overcomes the barriers of technique by highlighting such points. other points, such as its soundtrack, its composition of scenery, characterization of the 70's that are impeccable beyond the exquisite design of production.Yalitza Aparicio enchants everyone in her first pro-cinema performance, the young woman is able to transpose something real to her character, her little experience but very professionalism causes a sensation of recognition to the viewer, who then joins in mourning, compassion and love. Mariana De Tavira is in the moments that are required, and makes a character centered and completely desperate and combatant when it is accurate, its beauty contrasts its anger that result in great subplots throughout the work, in addition to moments of comic relief. Jorge Antonio is another good character in the film, since he is the pivot of some events and his character is extremely striking, even without having 5 minutes of screen.In the end, cuarón gets something unique again, the union of feeling and technique that blossoms in the best film of the year, a film that has everything a great work needs, and still causes reflection and conflicting feelings, the biggest injustice of oscar in 2019.

The movie portrays these opposites so well that it's breathtaking. You don't necessarily have to know about what life was like in Mexico at that time. It's more or less the same struggles people deal with everywhere around the world and it's very easy to relate certain things to yourself.I was always a fan of Alfonso Cuaron's signature single shot takes and there are a couple of amazing ones here as well. There is no score music in this film and it's just music coming out of certain sources which is a direction I personally love. It makes the movie much more realistic for me.

123,DeBBss,Movie of the Year?,10,22 December 2018,"When I saw ""The best picture of the year"" in the trailer, I really didn't think much of it; as people love to overhype movies. So I went into this blindly, not reading a word from the description, and most of the time I was puzzled with what was going on. Roma is one of those movies where you really have to think about the moral of the movie. There's no exact motive in the movie, and that's why it's so great. All of the movies I've ever seen always had an exact motive to drive the story and the characters. Roma just feels so realistic about peoples' emotions and actions.One of the biggest factors that make's this movie feel so realistic is that the story really doesn't go anywhere, like it's just going by, just like life. I see all these movies where the motives feel so unrealistic or unrelatable, which isn't a bad thing, but watching a movie that's so realistic and relatable is what makes Roma special. I've read some reviews saying ""I don't understand what's really the point of this movie"", and that's why it's such a great representation of life, because, ""what is the point of life?""The characters are by far the best part of the movie. Not only is the story realistic and relatable, but so are the characters. A wife stuck with her children because of an unloyal husband, a woman who was left by her partner due to an unplanned pregnancy, and children who are stuck in no man's land with a dysfunctional family. Yalitza Aparicio, the woman who plays Cleo did a fantastic job; it was her first big movie and she nailed it. The acting in general was amazing, it really made the movie more emotional and believable; even the kids who played the children were believeable.The movie is on the slow side, being over two hours, which is mostly because of the long panning shots. I know some people who hate long panning shots, but it makes the movie feel more real, like it's being told right in front of you, like live-action. I loved the black and white, it makes the movie feel like it's in it's own time period. One scene, where a car was pulling up in a drive, and with the black and white filter, it looked so beautiful; I never thought that you could make someone pulling into a driveway cinematic. Alfonso Cuarón direction was so cinematic; I really think he deserved the AACTA nominee for best direction.
There was no music in the movie whatsoever, it was quiet, lonely, and even more realistic.2018 wasn't a standout year for drama movies, there really wasn't a movie where it's picture of the year, but Roma is closest to it in my opinion. Everything about this movie represents life so perfectly. For me Roma wasn't a tearjerker, but it's a great drama. I really hope Roma gets picture of the year, I think it's easily the best movie of the year so far.",Roma

Heard so many raves about it, finally got around to seeing it last night. I'm sorry, this was just a bad movie, nothing redeeming about it. It's not art, it's lazy film making. Easy money for the director and people involved with it. It's much harder to make a movie with a story that is entertaining. Anyone can do this. It's not art, it's more like a home movie with actors paid to be there. No stars out of four. There's a reason it went straight to Netflix.",Roma
125,Thrashman88,Too Artsy Fartsy,5,30 January 2019,"ROMA is an artsy-fartsy film by Mexican filmmaker Alfonso Cuaron. It is, by no means a ""commercial"" film. It is however eye candy for the film student: wide panning shots, elegant cinematography, scarce dialog, etc. ROMA (named after the middle class neighborhood in the heart of Mexico City) takes place in what seems to be 1970. Mexican society was still reeling from the Tlatelololco student massacre of 1968 (carried out with the blessing of the US government, in an effort to repress any form of leftist social revolt), the nefarious Luis Echeverría was the next in line to be president, the economy was still rather healthy, etc. Instead of anchoring a storyline to such an interesting time in Mexican history, Cuarón decided to focus his story on a crumbling, middle class family and their house maid, going through a stormy divorce and trying to keep things from falling apart. The style of ROMA is a cross between French noir, documentary style and found-footage. Cuarón decided to make Cleo, the family's ""chacha"" (a termed used for house maids here in Mexico), the film's main character. Cleo (played very convincingly by Yalitzia Aparicio) is the embodiment of the typical Mexican house maid: decidedly Indian looking to the point of speaking in her native tongue in some scenes. Aparicio certainly looks the part, unlike the house maids in Mexican soap operas who look like Scandinavian princesses and are devoid of any sense of reality.
ROMA moves at an excrutiatingly slow pace. At 2:15 hrs, it feels longer than ANY Godfather movie. It is indeed a technically stunning film to watch but nothing more. It starts and ends without really saying much and I find it hard to believe the Academy has chosen this movie as a main contender, but I think I know why: this will be the very first time a Netflix produced movie is nominated for an academy award (here in Mexico, ROMA has been on Netflix for over a month and was never shown in theaters), so the Academy is breaking new ground here if this movie wins ANY oscars. Also, it would be the first time a Mexican movie wins best picture. Although Cuarón is a recognized Hollywood star, his previous movies have been American productions, not Mexican ones.I really wish ROMA the best of luck. It is a boring movie that's been beautifully made. If you're into artsy fartsy films with almost non existent dialog then ROMA is for you!",Roma
126,themadmovieman,"Deeply immersive, incredibly intimate, and visually exceptional",8,9 November 2018,"Many films use a sense of nostalgia in portrayals of times gone by, but few do it in quite as powerful fashion as Alfonso Cuarón's Roma. A deeply immersive film at every moment, perfectly capturing the time period and pulling you in right from the start, Roma is a slow and patient drama that you just can't take your eyes off, something that's furthered by exceptional cinematography, wonderful performances, and a slow-burn but deeply emotional story throughout.Now, when I say nostalgia, I don't just mean that Roma is full of 70s clichés to make the setting look convincing, I mean that a deep passion and personal attention to detail has gone into every single frame of the film, something that lends it an extraordinary depth of emotion and beautiful authenticity in a way that I've very rarely, perhaps never, seen before.As a semi-autobiographical story written by Cuarón himself, the film is clearly influenced by the director's memories of his childhood, as we see loving attention paid to the smallest of details throughout, yet it's that very practice that makes Roma such a moving and genuine film. Whether it be the small quirks of the family dog, the awkwardly tight driveway next to the house, or the everyday arguments between siblings, it's evident at every moment that this is a film with a deeply personal core, and through all of those tiny details, it helps you to relate all the more to the story being played out before you.And then we have the story of the maid, Cleo, played beautifully by Yalitza Aparicio. Once again, the portrayal of her dedicated, kind-hearted and loving character is something that very likely comes from Cuarón's own experience, so tender is the presentation and appreciation of Cleo throughout. That, combined with Aparicio's wonderfully understated yet endlessly likable performance, allows for Cleo to really stand out on screen, even if she is a woman of few words.You may think at first that Roma is a little slow and a little too quiet, but it's the patient and elegant build-up over the course of the film that really makes it worth it, and particularly in the case of Cleo, we see someone who you may think of as perfectly ordinary, but the film does an incredible job of showing how extraordinary she can be at times.On the flipside, the film isn't without its darker moments, and while the nostalgia and very intimate portrayal of the family is undoubtedly Roma's most moving element, the story further emphasises the importance of familial bonds through its portrayal of the more difficult moments in life, coming to a head particularly towards the final act.What's great about Roma is that it isn't a showy drama. Like I've said, it's all about the little things that add up to make it such a moving watch, and even when we do witness some deeply heartbreaking moments, the film keeps its feet on the ground and allows you to retain the same connection with the characters, no matter whether there at the highest of highs or lowest of lows, something that the screenplay does absolutely amazingly.The other most noteworthy part of Roma is its incredible visuals. Black-and-white cinematography is always used for a reason nowadays, and crafting a nostalgic vision of the past is one of its strongest suits, as is clearly proved here. What's more, however, is that the rather bright and stark contrasts of the black and white on screen are clearly indicative of the joys and suffering in both this family and the wider community's lives, and the use of that simple yet striking colour pallette from the start really helps to establish an atmosphere that allows for both immense joy and deep heartbreak to really move you.Also, in keeping with the understated tone, the film features some beautifully elegant camerawork that further immerses you in the setting, with slow yet dynamic pans across rooms and city streets, starkly powerful long take sequences, and a continual focus on Cleo, keeping her in frame for the majority of every scene she's a part of, further deepening the emotional connection with her that makes the story so engrossing.Briefly, if I were to have one problem with Roma, it would be that it's not the most widely accessible film. As a very personal and intimate piece, Alfonso Cuarón puts a lot of focus into the little things that make up the family in the story, however there is less attention paid to the wider socio-political context of the time, something that can occasionally leave you a little confused if you don't have a strong knowledge of modern Mexican history and culture.Contemporary politics and culture of course play a role in the story, however Roma is a film that focuses on a more normal story that ends up passing through moments of wider significance. Overall, it's far better that it does exactly that, as it cements the deep intimacy you feel with the characters on screen, further immersing you in the time period, but (like me) if you're not of Mexican heritage, or are rather unaware of what was going on during the early 1970s in the country, then the film can often prove a little inaccessible to really get to grips with.On the whole, however, Roma is a truly wonderful film that surpasses so many others in its use of nostalgia and memory, totally immersing you in its time period, and allowing you to develop an unbreakable emotional bond with its main characters, particularly Cleo, played in beautifully understated fashion by Yalitza Aparicio, and furthered by endlessly elegant visuals, the film is a deeply engrossing watch from start to finish.",Roma

Step son has a philosophy degree and he saw lots of allegorical connections with religion, which, when he explained them to me, kinda made sense. Personally, I was more interested in the superb choreography and direction - incredible attention to detail. I'm terms of the story, for me it was a bit hit and miss. Basically several vignettes based around the plight of Cleo - a maid for a middle class white family in Mexico City. Some of these vignettes were gripping - but to say much about them would spoil it. Others, I found myself switching off. Still, a remarkable visual and technical achievement shot in beautiful black and white. 7 and a half out of ten",Roma
129,patriciogl10,"Simple story, technically brilliant.",9,7 November 2019,"I applaud when filmmakers attempt to narrate a story by highlighting the visual aspect, enhancing technical efforts to construct a much applied version of their product. This is what happens with Roma, where Alfonso Cuarón knew that he had a very simple plot in his hands, and looked for
different resources to make his film even more appealing and artistically relevant. Some may say pretentious, some may say boring and that's okey because different people have very different takes on what constitutes as art, or something that desperately tries to be artsy. I thoroughly appreciate Cuarón's more than valid intention to tell his story using every resource he could to make his product unique, by fabricating through the use of black and white cinematography, his native language and culture, a historical context in his home country, heavy use of camera movement, employement of non-professional actors particularly leading lady Yaritza Aparicio who gives an exquisite and realistic portrayal of a middle class family's maid from Mexico, covered in shyness and willing to do a good job, emotionally attached by the lives of the family she serves.I enjoyed pretty much every aspect of this film, particularly the writing and how characters relate to one another; human interaction is greatly fascinating to me so I cannot help but to be immersed in some of the simplest stories ever put on film, as long as is met with emotionally relevant substance and heart-felt performances in order for the actors to transmit effectively their feelings through the screen. A bad script with wooden acting is the worst combination of all, that's how awful movies were historically made. You don't need to worry about that with Roma, because no matter how many bad ratings it has, it is still an excellent film that should be viewed by anyone.",Roma
130,jamesjustice-92,Bottled up real-life drama,7,21 January 2021,"Probably it took me way too long until I finally sat down and watched Roma but I have absolutely no regrets that I did. From the very first minutes the movie hits you in the face with almost palpable realism with the help of slowly following the actors steady camera which is a big plus for some scenes and a huge minus for others. Alfonso Cuaron is a fantastic director but as a director of cinematography he's fine at best, same goes to his editing skills, although these duties he shared with another person but it still doesn't cancel the fact that Roma needs more cross-cutting and less longer scenes and shots for us to be able to really feel the drama; I think would the director cut some unnecessary and expository scenes down to 100 minutes of total runtime the movie would've benefited a lot. No matter how real and suspenseful the movie feels overall the dramatic component is the most important one and it's been omitted in the movie multiple times and in the most relevant scenes too. Yalitza Aparicio's debut (and so far the only) role didn't break grounds either - her character stays more or less the same throughout the whole movie and I wasn't really moved by her performance as well. The story itself feels a little rough around the edges, slow at first it goes to full speed by the middle and touches upon many pertinent topics such as first love, unexpected pregnancy, marital affair, divorce, family values while playing against the background of 1970s rural Mexican city. Very interesting piece of art to say the least, filled with some graceful imagery, lovely black and white cinematography, very authentic set pieces and the whole 70s vibe and a thoughtful story but I wouldn't want to get back to it again due to the reasons mentioned.",Roma

132,jackgdemoss,"Undeserving of any nominations, besides cinematography",6,16 February 2019,"What makes a good film? Do I understand what makes a good film? These are the questions that are darting around my brain after viewing Roma in preparation for the 2019 Academy Awards. Roma is currently nominated for 9 Academy Awards, including Best Picture. This obviously led me to believe I was going to enjoy, or at the very least appreciate the film, which simply was not the case.At first I thought that perhaps I just do not enjoy dramas, and the bells and whistles of thrillers and superhero films have changed the way I enjoy cinema. This cannot be the case because of my recent love for The Kindergarten Teacher and Green Book. Which leads me to believe that I truly do not see films the same way that those at the Academy do. Roma was INTENSELY boring for the first hour. It was able to pull me into the world in which it wanted to tell a story, but then it failed to tell any meaningful story. By the end, I did feel like I was starting to feel something for the protagonist and her struggles, but it was far too late after suffering to stay seated for an hour and a half. Through all the weeds is one shining light, however. The cinematography, specifically the camera work and chosen still shots, was some of the best I have seen in 2018. I would advise against seeing Roma if you have limited time and must choose between 2018 Oscar nominees.",Roma
133,alfiefamily,Very Good Film! But A Masterpiece???,8,5 January 2019,"First off, let me say that ""Roma"" is a very good film. There's absolutely no way around that. It is a very good film.I first saw this on Netflix, and all I could think was, ""I would love to see this in a theatre with a large screen"". Tonight I got my wish. I got to see Cuaron's film in glorious 70mm. The cinematography is that much more impressive on a large screen. The simple composition of his shots and his use of mostly master shots with little to no movement seems ordinary on even a big screen TV, but in a movie theatre, it is breathtaking. This film will easily win best cinematography and maybe best editing.But a masterpiece? I'm not so sure. I had a hard time getting into the film until around halfway thru it. The story of an average family trying to get thru the troubles of everyday life as well as the political upheavals that were going on at the time, did not particularly hold my interest. While i found the story of the people who worked for the families more interesting, their stories, other than what is seen, are not explored.I also do not know exactly what makes up a masterpiece, I think that's subjective, and I don't want to be pretentious about my views. But again, other than the look and camerawork of the film, I wasn't really moved all that much.See it on a big screen if you can8 out of 10",Roma
134,Gresh854,Wow,8,20 December 2018,"Based off of a killer track record from acclaimed director Alfonso Cuarón-and considering I will and always be a die-hard Children of Men (and maybe even a tad slice of Prisoner of Azkaban) fanboy-you could suspect that I had feverishly awaited this new period-piece alluded to as, Roma.First and foremost, let me get off of my chest what E-V-E-R-Y-B-O-D-Y has been saying about Roma: ""It's a technical masterpiece."" This movie detects like it's one cohesive flow of topography wrapped up in a handsomely pragmatic package. And that sound design obliterates so hard that it-more or less-KO'd me out of my seat a number of times. Not because I had my volume up at 100, but because it was just that psychedelic. My neighbors are filing complaints as I write this. Worth it.The first two acts of this film predominantly attributes bonafide power-cohesive storytelling which (to be honest) is although not supremely bloggable nor lucid, eventually makes up its justification when the film, in the fullness of time, offers a finale of such watertight evolution that it sanctions you into an emotional pit of such almighty, heartfelt corollary.Roma is an imperative telling of how behind the depravity of madness is always sparks of grace, and sometimes you'll-like humans stubbornly do-power through those sentences of unadulterated hell just to score those few moments of beauty because beauty, well, is just too dang worth it. Even a tough life is sometimes worth flourishing, you know? To all the hardworking, invincible, single-parents out there, this film is dedicated to you. I condemn you with such utter and unfiltered reverence. Salut. (Verdict: A-)",Roma

Go sit outside and watch the paint dry on your siding and you've seen this movie. This is how I felt the first time I tried to watch this. It was excruciating to sit through due to the slowness. I fell asleep halfway through.But I gave it a second try the next night, and I was able to finally get into the second half of the movie. It did improve in the second half and had some good qualities to it. This is heavy handed art for the sake of art. It's very in your face. To that extent, it is what it says it is and has its merits.However, this is probably not a movie you would ever sit through more than once, just because there is nothing of value that would make it worth seeing again. The girl is excellent in the role and overall it is well done in that artistic way, but unless you are a student of film, there's nothing you can take with you out of the viewing experience if you were to watch it more than once (or twice if you want to see it with someone who hasn't seen it yet).I would give the technical achievements in the movie a 9/10 and the acting I would give a solid 8/10, but as far as a classic overall story, it is only fair- about a 6. It's impressive art, but not something I can see anyone revisiting to the point where it would be considered a classic or anything.

I don't want to hate on it though, as I've mostly boiled it down to just not ""clicking"" for me. Alfonso Cuarón does have some beautiful cinematography and nice long rotating shots done masterfully, and there's nothing wrong with the performances, but I just found myself unengaged for most of it. Sometimes the subtitles were difficult to read with the black and white colours blending together, but this has always been a problem for me with foreign movies having to focus on both the picture and the subtitles. Not going to dock the movie for it, just being honest.The pacing of the movie went by pretty quickly and there's a small handful of scenes that did hit me emotionally. Like I said, I don't feel bashing it is fair and I think it boils down to just not being my type of movie rather than being weak. Truthfully, I'm not a Cinephile, mostly a ""Normie"" film person who likes watching a lot of mainstream/blockbuster movies, but I do like to give films like this a chance and time of day rather than completely ignoring they exist at all.

138,Jared_Andrews,Two Great Scenes and a lot of Emptiness,6,30 October 2019,"""Roma"" is a movie made for a certain audience. For viewers who love art films, geek out over cinematography, art direction, and minute details, it's a godsend and a masterpiece. For viewers who want action and story that moves, they can give this one a hard pass.To say certain parts are dull would qualify as a massive understatement. Most scenes are puzzlingly dull. I say puzzling because you might find yourself wondering if you missed something during that 20-minute stretch of nothingness. I can assure you that you did not.The entire film contains two worth-watching scenes and 100+ minutes of emptiness.The film constantly lingers on shots for so long you'll begin to wonder if the wonder if the camera operator fell asleep. Then the next shot usually consists of something similar, as the camera holds for an unnecessarily long time once again.Other choices in the film are flat out bizarre. A naked sword display partway into the story serves no apparent purpose other than to encourage many Netflix viewers to stop watching and start streaming something else.Other times the camera fixates on closeups of dog poop. For a really long time. And then we see more dog poop. I really tried to understand the purpose of these shots, but I have no answer.To the film's credit, the two worth-watching scenes I mentioned earlier are both truly remarkable. They give director Alfonso Cuaron a chance to flex his filmmaking muscles. He masterfully makes use of long scenes with no cuts, which gives viewers no chance to breath and really makes it feel like we are there, present in the moment.But two great scenes don't make a great movie. The boredom overwhelms the snippets of brilliance, yielding a dull final product.If hardcore art films are your thing, give this one a try. If not, spare yourself from hours of boredom and the horrifying naked sword display scene.",Roma

Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad film by any means, but it certainly doesn't deserve even half of the praise that it's getting. The cinematography was pretty, the acting was solid, and the story was ok. But to me, the film felt patented and groomed to bait in awards and the critics totally fell for it. It drags on way too long, the drama feels a little over done towards the end, and it simply just didn't sustain my interest at the second half. I think that I felt more irritated that I paid $8 to go see a slow and melodramatic ""art"" film that I could've easily watched for free on Netflix (I don't pay for it so it's free).

143,scb_coldsteel,A modern masterpiece and a perfect case study on both the beauty and tragedy of the human condition,10,24 February 2019,"So I watched Roma for the second time on Netflix. I really wanted to watch the movie more than once before I tried to write a review. The movie really is a poetic cinematic achievement that reminds me exactly why I love film. It truly is one of the best films of 2018 and a new marker for what to expect from Netflix.The central plot of the film follows a maid and the family she works for as they navigate their seemingly ordinary life in 1970s Mexico. All the while the family and its security is put to the test as life happens and conflict occurs around every corner. The simple, yet poignant narrative tells a deeply human story about the struggles of the human condition and coping with loss and tragedy while keeping a family together. It's the kind of story you just don't see being made in Hollywood any longer. It's not a flashy story, but it is one of the most emotionally moving films I've ever seen.The beauty of the film also comes from its depth and complexity. The film acts as a slice of life case study regarding the existential insecurities of blue collar life and just how easy our world can collapse. The film in a lot of ways is a time capsule of 1970s Mexico. The setting acting almost as a driving character that constantly pushes the film and its conflicts forward. The meticulously well-chosen settings all paint a vivid picture of the deeply divided social landscape of the era and the difficulties of a working poor lifestyle.Through the use of its detailed characters the film examines issues like social class, political violence, sexism, oppression, and ethnicity. The film and it's underlining subtext reminded me of great classic naturalist authors and how they crafted intricate stories and characters that acted as social commentary on the conflicts of their time. The movie does not pull any punches when addressing socio-economic conflict, but at the same time never comes across as preachy or manipulative.All around the screenwriting of the film was excellent. Not only did Roma tell a poetic narrative about both the beauty and tragedy in life, it also acted as a complex examination of a number of social conflicts. On top of the rich narrative all of the characters and their dialogue felt so real and perfect for the film. Even the structure of the story arcs played with viewer expectations as this is not the kind of film that tells a traditional Hollywood morality tale. Some moments will remind you of the simple beauty of life, while others the stark reality of loss and tragedy.Of course it would be impossible to not talk about the technical achievement that is Roma. Alfonso Cuaron is certainly known for his directorial style. I can't say I loved his last film Gravity, which I found to be a case of style over substance. I really walked into Roma expecting an overrated art house film that critics were too afraid to criticize. Fortunately I was absolutely incorrect. Roma is a film of technical filmmaking at its finest.This isn't a movie that relies on special effects or gimmicky camera techniques, but uses meticulously well-thought-out shots that push the story forward. There doesn't seem to be a wasted shot in this entire film. Every scene has some meaning and conveys quite a bit of subtext. Of course the choice to shoot in a stark hyper realistic black and white paid off perfectly. In everyway the directorial decisions of this movie only served to enhance and further bring life to the stark and human narrative of the film.Acting wise the cast was perfect for the film. This isn't the kind of movie where a single actor dominates the film. I'm amazed at Yalitiza Martinez who absolutely deserves praise considering she has no formal training. She brought a genuine sense of vulnerability and realism to the role that would be hard to replicate.I loved Roma for a number of reasons. That being said this is a slow burn slice-of-life film that isn't simply trying to entertain. The movie is full of rich dialogue, but it's also full of the ordinary monotony in life. Just like in life some times it's boring and slow, but it's also unpredictable and can swing in an instance. Yes, the film has a slow start, but that was by design. I'm really having a hard time thinking of a genuine criticism for the film. No film is perfect, but Roma has all the makings of a film classic that could impact the very core of modern filmmaking.If you walk into Roma expecting the kind of film put out by most studios nowadays you will be disappointed. Roma requires patience and an ability to recognize the beauty and tragedy in our human existence. The movie appears simple on the surface, but ultimately tells a complex story that deals with a number of important social conflicts. It's at times painful to watch, while also providing a very human experience that will leave you moved. I highly recommend everyone to see this film as it certainly is not only one of the best of 2018, but also one of the best films I've seen in years. A 10 out of 10.",Roma

A dude seduces his date with a naked martial arts demonstration.
A guy gets shot out of a canon, cartoon style.
Fear not, ""Roma"" is not a surrealist comedy about silly male behaviour. It's better.After ""Gravity"" defying Hollywood, Alfonso Cuaron delivers an astonishingly moving ode to his youth, carefully stalking a family with a widescreen, smoky black and white lens. Endurance testing long, lava fluid, trance inducing, intoxicatingly delicious, cardiac arresting, ""Roma"" is the year's best movie. And it's not even close.The anti-Hollywood action flick we all so desperately needed, Cuaron's masterpiece plays as a distant, voyeuristic, peek at complicated family strife in astonishingly realized 1970 Mexico. It's all moving photographs, long, panning, beautiful takes of life's ugliness, revolving around the generous glow of beloved maid Cleo. Yalitza Aparicio is an understated wonder in the lead, evoking a spectrum of summer sun warmth to horrific tragedy, with a minimum of dialogue. Simply fabulous. And fabulously simple.At well over the dreaded two hour mark, ""Roma"" will test some impatient movie fuss-budgets, but once the spell takes hold, this movie won't let go.

The cinematography by Cuaron is the only greatness in this film. Other than that the movie is a bore and overhyped. I'm happy he was able to reproduce nostalgia on film but what a hum drum remembrance. Poor Cleo has to scoop up dog doo. Big deal. I've done that my entire life after walking my dogs. It certainly isn't worthy of film. I get it. The boyfriend leaves, the father leaves, the turmoil. It's just expressed in such an uneventful and unimaginative way. If you want a slice of life in the 70's, with some actual life to it, investigate "" City of God"". Whether the movie is so very accurate and brings back fond memories to so many as far as life in Mexico City during the 70's , the bottom line is this isn't Cuaron's masterpiece. It's his lame duck.",Roma

Do you like cameras moving slowly left to right and zooming in and out? Because that is about the only thing that Roma has to offer: good cinematography and exceptional camera work. Sometimes I just wish that people would get their own opinions and stop listening to the critics.I LOVE indie films, I enjoy black and white movies, I watch independent and low budget, I even like silent films and I tried really, really hard to enjoy this one but it is simply not captivating. Instead of picking one direction, Netflix and Cuaron simply couldn't decide if they are trying to be realistic, emotional or indie. Yes B&W is ""retro"" but this is a movie, not an instagram filter.Production and cinematography are first class and Cleo clearly loves the children but where is the plot? Where are the acting and music, where is the message or any kind of take away from the film? The director fails to convey emotional moments or make the audience care for the characters. Driving around Mexico, taking a bunch of scenic videos of completely random events and then throwing a family with a maid in the middle of it all does not constitute a movie. Yes it is art in looks but mediocre in storytelling and every other aspect of cinema.",Roma

This movie Roma is boring at heart and overlaid with tedious and pretentious film making techniques.. always side to side, always squashed and claustrophobic.

149,philthegreatone-786-63058,Roma,10,11 December 2018,This film is an emotional roller-coaster. It is beautifully shot and directed by Alfonso Cuaron. It is about a family in Mexico in the 1970's. They have a nanny named Cleo who is at the heart of the film.We see the family has love for Cleo but it at first always a servant. The opening shot of the film is so beautifully crafted you wonder how the filmmaker did it. You at that moment i think know your in for something special. The sound and music in this film so moving and evokes a real feeling inside you. The black and white photography is done so well and it times you forget your watching a film in another language. I dont want to say too much more about this because I dont want to give to much away. But do yourself a favor and watch this on the biggest screen you can find and not on a computer screen. You owe it to yourself. This film reminded me why I really love movies and went to film school and studied film.To go and see something different from what you have seen before. To get a slice of life from a family you wouldn't otherwise ever see in every day life. This is one of the best films of the year if not the best. I still of others to see. This film deserves serious Oscar consideration. I highly recommend this film.. .,Roma

With that being said there was absolutely no excitement. The videography is also very overrated the black and white color scheme along with the era it's portraying (The 70's) tricks your perception into thinking it's more artistic than it really is because the camera is topnotch and very clear and by utilizing computerized wide angle panning it keeps everything clean and crisp adding to the realism of the film. Yes this flick was too long but do I feel like I wasted 132 minutes of my life, not necessarily. Do I think this film was worthy of winning an academy award, not by a mile.

152,Come-and-Review,Indescribable,10,4 December 2018,"With this title I'm not trying to sound utterly overwhelmed, but to acknowledge the fact that I feel unable to describe with simple words this film.Let's start by saying that it is indeed one of Cuarón's best works (though I still consider Children of Men as my personal favourite), also probably the best film of 2018 (I couldn't see The Favourite yet, the other film of the year that I believe has serious chances of winning the title). It is a very slow film, has a pacing that reminds me of Tarkovskij films. It is not very introspective scope: the viewer mostly might feel physically distant (also due to the frequently wide-angled photography), but yet can be emotionally connected to the characters and the story.There's a very abudant apparatus of subtext: much is implied, and this is particularly true with Cleo's thoughts. Another element that suggests that much is implied is the presence of flying airplanes, that occurs in specific scenes, suggesting a meaning to it.
Mind, unlike Nemes' Sunset, this film isn't an allegorical story but a realist story. Frankly, it reminded much of Inarritu's first films (21 Grams, Biutiful, etc.) due to the realist factor.This film sets an interesting directoon to netflix films: easily said, it is the best Netflix original. It is also an arthouse film, and very clearly so. This film could start a new tendency (especially if awarded at the Oscars) for arthouse films to be produced and released by netflix, a company known for providing creative freedom to directors. In the past years, this had mostly a negative impact, with several 'bad' netflix originals, but this allows genial filmmakers (like Cuarón, but potentially others aswell) to create their works without boundaries. Let's hope this tendency continues.",Roma

Many have said it is amazing from a female point of view and not that, that is a bad thing but as a male I can't relate on the same level as a woman would watching Roma. However I did sympathize with the main character... see what I mean? This movie left me so lost for this review. I absolutely despised Fermin which is an incredible feet for a character who only appears in probably 15 minutes of an over two hour film. There is so much symbolism in this movie, that maybe I do need a second viewing to really like it, but for now I'm going to give it a 7 because it did keep me captivated and the cinematography was gorgeous. I'll probably update this if I watch it again.",Roma
155,howboutthisone_huh,colossally boring if you take away the technical aspects,7,24 January 2019,"The oscars reflect hollywood persona more than exemplify peer review of film making. Maybe it's always been like that I don't know but this year is no exception because 10 nominations for this kind of film is unjustified. IMHO Mr Cuaron produces the most complicated scenes on film of any director I can think of, past or present. But his films don't have a level of story telling that I would expect from his professional tier. Even 'gravity', which is his most commercially successful movie to date doesn't have much story to it and 'roma' has even less of a plot. This movie is wonderful to watch from a technical perspective. The scenes are long with no cuts. The scenes have very complicated cinematography. They have a lot of actors and extras that are perfectly choreographed. But, this movie has very little story to it. If you took away all the complicated cinematograpy and staging, it would be colossally boring. And it's not because I can't relate culturally to the characters or settings in the movie because one of my favorite films (series) last year was 'my brilliant friend', an italian tv series hosted by HBO. I have nothing in common with this production either. I'm not italian. I didn't grow up in italy in the 50s. There are parts which are incomprehensible from my cultural perspective but it's nonetheless a beautifully told story. Two completely different non-english film productions that are amazing to watch but one is a very simple production but very full story told wonderfully and one is a complicated production with almost no story to it. If 'roma' is worth 10 oscars, where are the accolades for making 'my brilliant friend'? BTW, if you haven't seen 'roma', it has nothing to do with italy and it has nothing in common, storywise, with 'my brilliant friend'. I only mentioned 'my brilliant friend' because it's a wonderful non-english film (series) that hollywood would never make and with respect to productions, the two films have a lot in common.",Roma
156,gcsman,Simplicity and vision: A remarkable film by Alfonso Cuaron.,9,18 January 2019,"The only other Alfonso Cuaron film I've seen was Gravity (2013) which I thought was absolutely stunning, but in quite a different way than Roma, which is almost its polar opposite in subject matter and style. If there's any common factor, I'd put it down to simplicity and vision. Everyday life in and around Mexico city in the 1970's lives and breathes in Roma, portrayed in a very methodical, unhurried way, but the whole thing has a kind of cumulative power that is rather hard to define. It's all in the way it's done.Cleo (played by Yalitza Aparicio) is at the heart and soul of this story, as one of two domestic workers (the second one is the cook) in the household of an upper-class family with 4 young-ish children. The parents, and others in their upper social class, basically do what they like and it's left to their hired staff to pick up all the pieces at home to keep things running. In Cleo's family the parents are out at their work much of the day and it seems to be expected of Cleo to do just about everything around the house: constantly look after the children, fetch and carry, laundry by hand, errands --- she's on her feet all day long. But far from being a 'slave' she's a loving and loved member of the household: she and the children have strong bonds. Apparently, Roma is an homage to Cuaron's own childhood nanny, so it's a very personal accomplishment.Everything about this - the settings, the street life, the household, the close ties between Cleo and the kids -- is all utterly realistic. My wife and I both travelled a fair bit to Chile (Santiago, Concepcion, La Serena) for work purposes in the 1970's and 80's and it all looked and felt like that. Any well-to-do household had someone like Cleo working for them: the family would typically be of white/hispanic stock and the hired workers were aboriginal, sometimes (like Cleo in this story) from small hardscrabble villages. Life in the town happened on the street, not inside the houses. The streets are always filled with people going every which way in and out of small shops, chatting, and ducking fast-moving ramshackle old cars. There are always dogs roaming free -- lots of dogs. Random marching bands playing badly go by on the street for no apparent reason. Soccer fields where young men gather are just dirt and dust. ""Roma"" sets up this ambience without making any particular point about it -- it's just there.None of this background gets across the peculiar effect of Cuaron's direction. The strength of human love and community devotion shine through here, but also the resilience, love, and self-reliance of average people. We see everything from Cleo's point of view -- not just her family but also occasional major events ""out there"" that just happen around them and that she simply witnesses: an earthquake in the city, a brush fire, a student demonstration and subsequent deadly riot. None of these necessarily fit into any coherent plotline, but I take it as just Cuaron's building of a comprehensive picture of life then and there.Through most of the film there's also no musical score, which was a clever choice that I thought drew us in closer to the characters. Like other viewers I was really struck by Cuaron's camera technique here. Often it simply sits steady as a rock while the scene develops. Equally often it pans, very slowly and very steadily, to give a broader perspective. The culmination of all this comes at the end, when Cleo, the mother, and the kids are all at the beach for a picnic. Cleo, who can't swim, ultimately has to wade very far out into the gathering surf to try to pull back two of the kids who've gone too far. The camera simply follows her slowly out, farther and farther into higher and higher waves, with absolutely nothing else on the screen to look at. Without giving away how it ends, I'll just say that the simplicity and raw power of this scene make it, somehow, one of the most remarkable I've ever seen in a movie. Any director who could envisage this and pull it off has my admiration. That scene is worth the whole price of admission, but you need to see everything that comes before it to get its full meaning.",Roma
157,PotassiumMan,A fascinating portrait of a humble life,7,26 November 2018,"Alfonso Cuaron depicts the life of a young housekeeper in a prosperous family household in Mexico in the early 1970s in this heartfelt, slice-of-life drama. He does so with a stellar cast, black-and-white filming and crisp cinematography that includes wide ranging geography within Mexico.I was impressed by how well this film held my attention from start to finish. It isn't always the smoothest narrative and there are occasional lulls in the storytelling but it slowly lifts you into a state of wonder. Some scenes are quiet and deliberate. Others are Fellini-esque. The film covers a surprisingly broad landscape as we watch this woman seek out the young man she believes is her destiny as well as cope with the goings-on of the family she must tend to where not all is well. There is also a sense of the strong social unrest in Mexico during that era.Cuaron has made a deeply personal film, one that harkens back to the Mexico in which he grew up. It is seen through the eyes of a young woman with a modest job. The black and white filming actually makes you forget that this took place in decades past. Instead, it feels very contemporary. There are some profoundly poignant moments here even if the pacing is a bit inconsistent. At times, you'll be holding on for dear life. At the center is a quiet, reserved but very genuine performance and one that lights up the screen. Gladly recommended.",Roma

We follow the very kind Cleo, a house help in an upper middle class family being torn apart by infidelity.My wife and I discussed this movie and agreed on it being quite slow but still intriguing. This is so as our lead actress gives us an Oscar worthy performance with her conveying of emotion, and director Alfonso Cuarón does an excellent job at depicting 1970s Mexico City. In my opinion there are three very strong and emotional scenes in the film only captivating me more so.Cinematography is absolutely beautiful in black and white monochrome. There are several instances and even scenes consisting of one shots reminiscent of the cinematographic style of Alejandro Innaritu.Overall a recommendable and beautifully constructed film.",Roma
159,bastille-852-731547,Utterly Brilliant Slice of Life,10,16 December 2018,"Alfonso Cuarón has made several brilliant films, but he has truly outdone himself and made his true masterpiece with this searing, thoughtful drama set in Mexico City in the early 1970s. ""Roma"" is absolutely stunning, and the best film of the year. The film is an ode to Cuarón's childhood and what he perceives to be a Mexico of a somewhat distant past. It is a drama that primarily surrounds Cleo, a maid, and the family of the house she cleans, yet the film's depth is so much more than a simple one-sentence synopsis could provide. Once you see this film, you will not be able to forget it.Cuarón clearly intended the tone of ""Roma"" to be deeply rooted in realism, which is evident by the film's extraordinary black-and-white cinematography. The film is a technical marvel, with cinematography that helps each frame stand out. While the film does not really have a score, viewers won't miss it, as Cuarón's sound design is expertly constructed to an almost intoxicating degree. Even though I love many of the scores of films I really admire, this movie makes you appreciate just how much emotional power is delivered through the characters, cinematography and sound design that the absence of a score actually enhances the film in many parts. The film's third act is extremely powerful and a true roller coaster of intense emotions, yet each and every emotion Cuarón brings to the frame is truly genuine. Every sight and sound in the film has a purpose in tandem with the narrative, making the film's plot structure seem meticulous. The film's realism is present in its inherent motifs as well. For example, while the film certainly provides commentary on the deep-seated inequality present in Mexican society, its worldview is also pluralistic and universal in that lines of unity rather than division between characters are often emphasized. I particularly took note of this during the scenes with both Cleo and Sofia (the household matriarch,) many of which are incredibly poignant. The movie also pulls off an incredible feat of depicting social and political unrest around this time in Mexico City in considerable detail, without ever feeling overtly political or preachy as a film as a whole. (The story is didactic, but never preachy or melodramatic.) The film is lighter on dialogue than many dramas, but this is certainly not detrimental to the story given that the screenplay does a brilliant job communicating as much as possible in as few lines of dialogue as possible--which is, of course, what master screenwriters always strive to do.As a family drama, a slice-of-life film, an ode to Mexican society and culture, and an epic, ""Roma"" succeeds with flying colors. 10/10",Roma

161,Sasha_Lauren,"A totally unique, poetic cinema experience",9,5 September 2019,"Alfonso Cuarón created a totally unique, poetic cinema experience inspired by his own upper middle class childhood in the Colonia Roma neighborhood of Mexico City in the 1970's. The POV is centered on the Indigenous woman who was his family's beloved live-in domestic housekeeper and nanny to four children; she was the quiet backbone to the family during a year in which their father, Antonio, left their mother, Sofía, (as they were so-named in the film).Alfonso auditioned actresses for a year before finding Yalitza Aparicio who - in her first ever acting role - inhabits the role of Cleo with a humble naturalness that allows the audience to be swept into a yearlong slice of her life as a young woman during personal and political upheaval.From the opening moments when we are drawn into a black and white shot of soapy water being repeatedly slopped and rinsed over floor, the audience is asked to let go of the mind, be patient, be present, and surrender to this ride.Their world is centered in a home of structually open design with a beautifully-railed staircase that Cleo trots up and down spritely and alternatively laboriously on in her daily service to the family, on a street on the more run-down side of town. A rambunctious dog oversees everyone's comings and goings to punctuate the jumpy upheaveal in their lives. The garage is either too narrow or the boat-of-a-car too wide, and each time the vehicle is manuevered, (carefully or not), into the confined space, I could practicaly smell the smothering exhaust as the conflict of desiring more than is possible or appropriate, and the resistance to seeing another way, knocked against me as the car was dented by contact with the claustrophobic walls.Quiet moments are interspersed with both lively and chaotic noisy city ambiance. Wide yet nuanced shots in black and white capture intimate details of Cleo's life caught in the throes of classism, racism, sexism, and a crude, patriarchal society. Her boyfriend for a brief time, Fermín, turns out to be a no-good gang member who physically and emotionally abandons her in her time of need. An emergency visit to a hospital is brilliantly shot to detail the impersonal and cruel reality Cleo experiences.As Cleo is mourning a devestating loss that she is wracked with guilt over, Sofía invites her maid to join her and the children on a trip to the sea. Cleo's relationship with, and love for, her charges and the instinctual sacrifice she makes without question for them made this film memorable for me; although the journey was wrenching at times, I found it a rewarding one that leaves me with lingering images to savor and grieve.To put it mildly, this film is a marvelous work of art.",Roma

It's unfair to compare Roma to Green Book, of course, with one movie being a cinematographic masterpiece depicting stark contrasts between the haves and have-nots, and the other being a road-trip movie which does little more than trigger memories of better road-trip movies.From the opening scene of water washing over tiles, to the closing scene of water washing over life, Roma weaves a beautifully fluid narrative that exposes the unjust bases for classism, sexism, and economic segregation, seamlessly stitched with the needles and threads of unspoken love which can emerge at the most inconvenient times. Life would be simpler if we could avoid foreign entanglements, but despite what any fans of Ayn Rand would have you believe, people need other people.Alfonso Cuarón's choice to produce the stark contrasts of black and white was essential, but it seems predictably unfair for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to punish Roma for being filmed in Spanish. Roma was not the just the Best Foreign Language Film of 2019, it was simply the Best Picture of 2019.",Roma
166,jaredpahl,The Great Mexican Classic,9,23 April 2020,"Roma might fool you into thinking it is one of the dozens of small, pretentious, art house awards baiters that critics dutifully praise to the heavens every year. I myself braced for the worst, expecting a slow, pointless, slice-of-life bore set in 1970s Mexico. In actuality, Alfonso Cuarón's autobiographical cinematic love letter is a grand, sure-handed classic. It forgoes gritty realism and sociological posturing (As if often the case for such awards contenders) in favor of beautiful black-and-white cinematography, exquisitely drawn characters, and masterful direction from one of the great living minds in Hollywood.Roma is based loosely on Alfonso Cuarón's real life upbringing in middle-class Mexico City. But the movie is not about young Alfonso. It serves as a portrait of a side character in Cuarón's life, his family's loyal housekeeper, Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio). Cuarón finds in her story, a sweeping odyssey. No, she isn't commanding armies or leading a revolution, but her journey through life's familiar stresses feels just as harrowing. Credit for this feeling of grandeur has to go to Cuarón, who projects immense emotional power onto recognizable facets of everyday life.A lot of Roma is dedicated to small, intimate moments: the cleaning of a driveway, a family outing gone awry, a stop at the furniture store. Such scenes can be insufferable in the hands of a director without a strong artistic point of view. But Alfonso Cuarón has a strong artistic sense, and he makes Roma feel big by putting us in Cleo's shoes. We experience the journey through her eyes, meaning that we recognize the importance the small moments contain, and we're floored by the heart-rending drama of moments that are relatively huge. Add to this the political turmoil always bubbling on the outside, and you have a movie that brilliantly translates the enormity of a common life to the big screen.The genius of Roma is in how it captures the towering emotional power intrinsic even in an unassuming, ""normal"" life. The real-life Cleo was simply part of Alfonso Cuarón's background. She was no Great Man of History, but behind her modest facade, portrayed excellently by first time actress Aparicio, she endured trials deserving of reverence. Roma knows that every extra in our lives has a story. We all careen through this world on thrilling, profound, beautiful journeys, whether they look that way from the outside or not. For all Roma's technical brilliance, its cinematic beauty, the film's greatest contribution is in how it reframes our ideas of heroism. It helps us appreciate the Cleos in our own lives, the Great Men and Women we see every day.93/100",Roma

169,Camoo,"Stunning, especially if you were one of the rare few to see it in a theater.",9,16 December 2018,"Begin rant: Netflix to me is the bane of the art of filmmaking. It's where art goes to die. Watching Roma on a computer screen, where most will eventually watch it, is a crime. In part because Netflix encourages such poor viewing habits, and laziness: people will invariably pause, stop, or half-watch this film in a fragmented manner, often with with lights on in their room, or other screens, and they will miss the details which make Roma so sumptuous. Most will hear this film through their laptop speakers, missing the lush, enveloping sound design, while they peruse Amazon on a competing browser tab. Many will no doubt fail to make it to the end, finding it 'too slow' or wonder why it is in black and white.This is the main difference between the cinema and Netflix: Netflix you can control. The cinema on the other hand controls you; you pay, you sit and you are subjected to a film, and be damned if there's anything else you want to do. You're stuck there and you're going to experience it full on.The bitter irony is that Netflix is also one of the few places filmmakers of great artistic import have left to fund their personal projects, or anything that doesn't involve 200$ million plus in CGI or superhero makeup. Netflix, having sucked the entire market into its gravity, has the megabucks and as a result is willing to take the risks that studios won't anymore. And that reality, for a cineaste, is a tremendous sadness.But that is where we are. And what we still have are artists like Cuaron who have a vision and will find a way to deploy that vision no matter what it takes. The result is breathtaking. And, whether Netflix likes this or not, we have the viewers who bought up every single ticket of this film at my local theater (it played in a single small theater in Montreal) in a matter of hours, knowing that they will only have a week to watch it before Netflix yanks it and makes it exclusively available on their platform. I hope somebody at that company notices.Roma is an intimate, personal film told simply, with the utmost attention to detail, and it contains a great deal of humanity, empathy and beautiful imagery that is completely worth your money.

It just seemed to try so hard, but I didn't feel there was substance, or honestly, any true effort and talent. Maybe, it's a movie for the critics and the industry, but not for me.",Roma
173,Richard_Alex_Jenkins,I'm not the only one then?,4,30 January 2019,"What a relief it is to come onto IMDB and discover that many reviewers feel the same way that I do about the underwhelming nature of this film.It's the same process every year, when I sit down to watch a stack of films that initially went under the radar, which 'must' be seen in order to have a valid opinion, and Roma sat somewhere in my list of top views for 2018.Well, nothing happened much for just over two hours except obviously great camera work and interesting parallax scrolling for the purposes of more depth, but so what? And I understood a good part of the Spanish commentary too due to living in Brazil, which made it even more strange.This film appeared to be the director's opportunity to indulge himself, and he did so splendidly at the expense of a cohesive and interesting story. I didn't hate Roma at all, just found it largely uninteresting.Additionally, I'll be absolutely horrified if this picks up all the major honors at the Oscars this year. It's a classic example of when all the technical categories such as cinematography, editing, lighting, etc., are ticked, but confuse people into thinking it's a great story and wonderfully entertaining film, which it isn't.",Roma

175,KeremUlucay,GREAT ARTWORK FOR CINEMA CULTURE,8,17 December 2018,"Roma is a great movie with an amazing cinematography. Every scene of it is qualified. I really liked the scenes which is camera turns its own axis. There are some sharp scene transitions, they look cool. Also, black-white composition is a great choice. But If i talk honestly, my expectations were bigger about it. Because every critic and YouTuber I listened were saying damn great things about Roma. For me, this movie cant tell its intensity of emotions in very important times. Let me give an example, when Fermin said ""Never call me again, you fu*king maid...(or something like that)"", camera didnt go back to Cloe and we couldnt see her reaction to this bad situation. And while I was watching the movie, I was continuously waiting something big which could make a big change on story. But I didnt find something like that. Movie goes slow, especially in first hour and thats the reason. Of course there were some events which has touched my heart, has made an effect on story but like I said before, I expected more. Another point is I couldnt hear any music during the movie, I think thats a wrong decision because if they would make clear choices about music, it would fit perfectly on composition. Anyway, I liked Roma, it is a great art house movie and Im excited for Alfonso Cuaron's next film.",Roma

In black and white it all looks so cold and drab.Most annoying features include the unnecessary dogs (either stray or ignored) and the irritating, out of control, spoiled children.

There are some meticulous cinematographic moments, but it lacks essential aspects that should be found in a decent story as I stated. Lacking the ability to make an interest to the events or bestow on a deep dimension to the personas as a matter of fact, it's frustrating how muzzy the portrait we have of the family, It's not totally terrible movie but it lacks the artistic side so if you are overly artistic this won't be much entertaining for you the scenario has nothing special it was mediocre it's more about the editing If you're the type to watch movies every once in a while, then weed out this film from your list or you will not watch films anymore.",Roma
180,Endless_01,A cinematographic beauty.,8,4 June 2019,"Rome chronicles the life of a middle-class Mexican family through the eyes of its Mixtec employee, mainly set in the early 1970s.I can understand the negative criticisms about the film, being one of its most mentioned complaints the fact of a lack of narrative or constructed argument, without more investigation of characters or a clear development of these, and yes, the truth is right, however I believe that this is the main point of Rome. The film is not centered on the characters, but is centered on Mexico, its environment and events, its evolution through history and the living movement of its citizens and landscapes. I believe that the fundamental aspect of the film is to show us the most beautiful images possible of a nostalgic memory, trying to transmit us completely the beauty of the decade of the 70s in Latin America, which is why I consider that this film is not made for everyone, since its lack of dialogue or linear narrative make it very different and even boring for many people, however, people who appreciate cinema in all its fields can find a certain sweetness and definitely a lot of beauty in Rome.As a Latino, I have to say that I am completely captivated by the realistic images and representations of Mexico during the 70s, the history of Latin America itself is related by multiple factors, especially the political and armed, with a very strong and violent history that can stand out in our memories, a certain scene in Rome shows us the particularity of those times, the constant fear.Rome is a beautiful movie, it has one of the best shots and camera work I have ever seen in any film, totally exceptional, despite its lack of characters or argument, some people can admire and feel the beauty of this work. I believe that especially those Latinos who lived those times, will appreciate the images and feel a stroke of nostalgia as they enter the streets of Rome, portrayed with beauty and realism.",Roma
181,cappiethadog,Put down the broom,9,27 February 2020,"""We are alone. No matter what they tell you, we women are always alone,"" Sofia(Marina de Tavira) tells her maid, left dazed in the aftermath of her employer's inebriation-fueled meltdown. Cleo(Yalitza Aparicio) is unaccustomed to being addressed as a woman of equal distinction. She's the help who picks up dog poop in the white Spanish-speaking family's driveway. A Galaxy 500, Sofia's philandering husband's car, has seen better days, after a night of drunk driving. Cleo says nothing about dents on the car's body in the driveway wall. The maid is not Sofia's confidant. This temporary intimacy will pass when her employer sobers up. The sun will rise again. The dog will poop again. The maid will be summoned. Master and servant, segregated by stairs; that's the map of the house, in Alfonso Cuaron's ""Roma"", which is not so dissimilar from Robert Altman's ""Gosford Park"". Set in Mexico City circa 1971, the difference between Cleo, an indigenous servant, and her employers is less about race than social class and language. Pepe(Marco Graf), the youngest of the brood, despite loving Cleo the best, tells her to stop speaking Mixtec with Adela(Nancy Garcia), the cook. Spanish, not English, is the language of hegemony.The periphery, always the periphery, Cleo stands, Cleo straddles; her familial status in flux. Most days and nights, Cleo remains on the margins, a well-received servant who is unconditionally around, just short of real love. She's a live-in maid, a preferred stranger with permission, but that permission can be revoked in an instant. Standing upright behind the family, she crashes family hour, smiling politely, catching the afterglow of the black and white TV and laughter, while they guffaw at the comedy hijinks of a variety show. Antonio(Fernando Grediaga), the runaway father, is home for, what will be the final time, unbeknownst to Sofia, who feels empowered having her husband around the house. Very discreetly, Cleo sits next to the sofa's end, buffered by Pepe, who drapes his arm around the maid's neck. The mother, however, has eyes in the back of her head. She knows that Sofi(Daniela Demesa) and her youngest son adore Cleo, like a second mother. To maintain her primacy, she lets Cleo know who's in charge of this family. Sofia evicts the maid from their living room, under the pretense of fixing Antonio a cup of chamomile tea, with a pleasant voice that masks her authoritarianism. How much does Cleo know? This bourgeoise family, bred a certain way, doesn't allow for its servants to eat amongst them at the dining table; they take their meals in the kitchen, seemingly without complaint. Ignacio(Andy Cortes), the driver, makes his own living arrangements. But Cleo and Adela share sleeping quarters in an adjoining loft within the family compound, even though the main house seems large enough to accommodate both women.It's false equivalency what Sofia forces upon the maid. Cleo's heartache is her won, but the employer co-opts this proletarian angst and makes their shared pain implicitly about her struggle, since from Sofia's perspective, she has more to lose; a breadwinning husband and father of their four children, whereas Fermin(Jorge Antonio Guerrero), Cleo's beau, was just another poor Mexican with no future. In all likelihood, Sofia never bothered to learn his name, let alone, be invited to the estate. When Cleo informs the boss about her pregnancy, Sofia reassures this distraught young woman that, rest assured, she'll stay on as their housekeeper. And yet, there can be detected the slightest emotional sterility beneath this compassionate outpouring. No questions are asked. Cleo needs the catharsis of telling her story. At the movie theater, Fermin gets up and leaves, forgetting his jacket and leaving Cleo behind in one fell swoop, upon notification about looming fatherhood. Sofia has no time for sob stories from the help. Sure, Cleo can tell the cook, but Sofia is a mother figure, who could help stop the flow of tears sooner rather than later. Visibly crying, Pepe asks his mother instead of Cleo about her state, as if the maid was half a woman or dog. He rubs Cleo's stomach, just as you would as some cherished pet, after the mother uses ""tummy-ache"" as a cover story. Later in ""Roma"", as a matter of underscoring the maid's otherness, Sofia orders Cleo out of the house, not wanting a servant to see this authority figure at her most vulnerable, after catching Pepe eavesdropping behind the bedroom door, in regard to Antonio, who is leaving the family without saying goodbye. Cleo can be remade into a stranger, on a whim, on a dime, on cue. How would Sofia respond if her maid uttered these comforting words: ""We are alone. No matter what they tell you, we women are always alone?"" Not with appreciation, that's for sure, since Cleo lacks the gravitas to be taken seriously. The comparative story goes like this: Cleo tracks down Fermin, who threatens to kill her and the unborn baby if she interrupts his training with Los Halcones again. In the near-future, this paramilitary group will be responsible for killing hundreds of student demonstrators in The Corpus Christi Massacre. Those stories, however, are Mexican stories, both current and future, local matters which have no relevance to Sofia and her children. How men are, regardless of skin color, remains the same; it's the women who they couple with, that makes the difference. Cleo is a maid; she lacks agency. It makes no difference if she's in a home in her homeland, or away, afar, aghast.Singapore circa 1997, that's the setting for Anthony Chen's ""Ilo Ilo"", another film about masters and servants, which like ""Roma"", addresses the hierarchy of skin. Straight from the airport, Teck(Chen Tianwen) arrives home with a woman, obviously, in shell shock, made worse by the smallness of the apartment. Why does this Singaporean couple need a maid? It's been a whirlwind. In a matter of hours, she metamorphosed from having a full-fledged persona to being a blank slate. Hwee Lang(Yeo Yann Yann) shows the new maid where she'll be sleeping. Her cot folds out from a child's bed. Theresa(Angeli Bayani) lets it sink in; her roommate is a boy. Jiale(Koh Jia Ler) bullies her, without mercy. Theresa's first meal with her new employers is an experience in humiliation, when the boy dictator moves his plate into another room. The very idea of the maid having a seat at the table fills him with revulsion. The parents scold Jiale, but not harshly enough; not with the same vigor, surely, if Theresa was Singaporean like them. This unchecked abuse continues, until finally, the boy's jejune behavior nearly puts Theresa's work visa in jeopardy, when Jiale slips unpaid items into the maid's shopping bag at a store that sells stationery. At home, the maid asserts herself as the adult, pinning the boy to his bed while she lays down some much-needed ground rules. Jiale is the child, not her; a twenty-eight-year-old woman, the mother of an infant son she had to leave back home with family. Arguably, in ""Roma"" the adult/child binary is never established. When Cleo accompanies the family on a road trip, the youngest boy complains aloud that Cleo has gone mute. The maid is there to entertain him. If it was up to Cleo, she would have stayed behind, but a servant has no choice in the matter. She recently delivered a stillborn baby. Nobody offered their condolences. Also, during the political uprising. Fermin aimed a gun at her in a furniture store above the melee. The grandmother(Veronica Garcia) was purchasing a crib. Out of fear, her water broke, triggering a premature birth. Cleo needs to mourn, in private, not on the beach, with fair weather family members.Jiale starts to love Theresa as a second mother. The maid, not Hwee Lang, is there to watch his public caning at a school assembly. It's only the threat of deportation that keeps her silent.Cleo can't swim. Without hesitation, she pushes against the waves and guides Tono(Diego Cortina Autrey) and Sofi back to shore. Sofia thanks her, effusively. An emotional hug takes place on the sand. But when they return home, the regular rhythms of segregated life never misses a beat.The maid returns to the loft.Cleo was just doing her job.",Roma

Roma is a simple but powerful story about a maid set in 1971 Mexico City. This film is an essential viewing in big screen but sadly we didn't get the opportunity. Even the opening credits is so beautiful and gives us an idea about what this movie is going to be about.I wasn't surprised when I heard the Cuaron was gonna shoot his own movie like Paul Thomas Anderson did last year knowing that he edits his own movie it was only obvious that he is gonna venture into new territories. He does a brilliant job at it & the B&W colour and frame were perfect.The film moves a bit slowly after the first hour but nevertheless keeps you hooked. I personally feel it could have been if they narrated the film in the form of Acts or Chapters like Tarantino does considering the movie is about an episode in the life of a young maid. The misogyny and oppression faced by women are shown in 2 different forms in the lives of Sofia and Cleo.The performances were impressive with Marina De Tavira being the most impressive performer. She captures your attention completely in every scene she is in. The kids were amazing too and the scenes where the brothers fight are so natural.PS: The best part of the film is the last 15 minutes.,Roma

186,Equalizer16,The most powerful cinematic journey of year.,10,17 December 2018,"Alfonso Cuaron take us back to his childhood in mesmerising cinematic journey of Roma.Set in 1970s Colina Roma, the life of a maid: Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio) working for an upper middle class family who live and survive in Mexico City. Surrounded by riots and demonstrations, the dark and wonderful surfaces to the city are explored in this visual tale. Based off Cuaron's life growing up in Mexico, the director brings his cinematic talents back to his roots, not since his 2001 road movie: Y Tu Mamá Tambien. Cuaron demonstrates how intact and important his childhood is and is magnificently captured in a personal song to his past.In an episodic fashion, we follow Cleo through her life cleaning the floors, tending to the children as if they were her own, and going to the movies with her marital art practising boyfriend Fermin (Jorge Antonio Guerrero). Selected beauty scaping moment, that move, distress and horrify, Roma dives into moving and shocking.Roma is wave after wave of emotional and cinematic beauty that washes over you with personal entanglement. Cuaron's vision of his memory feels photographic. With astoundingly comprehensive sound design, detailed to the last drop of water, the sound and life of Mexico is breathing an surrounding embodiment. The grounded prospect of Cuaron's direction, is filled with his homestyle traces of Y Tu Mamá Tambien with the similar sentiment of Children of Men (2006), and then topped with the overpowering ecstasy of Gravity (2013) brought back down to earth.Using first time actors, Cuaron takes excessive realistic and minimalist approach to bring his memories alive. Yalitza is a sensation for her first screen appearance, a loyal maid, loving guardian to the family children, one sequence contains one of the most convincing hugs I have ever seen on film. Sofia, the mother of family is played by Marina de Tavira who roams the screen with lucid emotional intensity, highly strung as she keeps her family together through their trials. The intimacy between the characters is an infectious and heart throbbing, Cuaron's heart and soul are clear on screen.Shot on 65mm, Cuaron creates a landscape embracing experience, enhancing the world of Mexico City to full virtual effect. The black and white cinematograph add closer texture striking lighting, which is impressive to see alongside Pawel Pawlikowski's smoky Cold War (2018). Although it's unfortunate to see another truly worthy masterpiece of cinema release (unless seeked out) Roma wide release on Netflix will hopefully bring something extraordinary for subscribers on the popular screaming service. Made of wide pans, the smoothness of Cuaron's hand is to precise delicacy not to disturb the authentic motion.With award season gearing, voters would have to be blind not give this film the attention it deserves. As arguably the most powerful cinematic journey of year Alfonso Cuaron fresh masterpiece should not be missed.",Roma
187,joker-4,"Meandering story, but beautiful to watch",8,8 February 2019,"Forget Alfonso Cuarón's smooth camera work and his technical attention and his ability to wreak havoc in the background while his foregrounds remain calm and focused. Instead, watch ""Roma"" and pay attention to Cuarón the photographer who can bring beauty and life to a million shades of gray.Filmed in a black-and-white palate that is more beautiful than the colors of Las Vegas, ""Roma"" is Cuarón's love letter to movies and to life. Cuarón is already a master filmmaker, known for his sweeping battle action from ""Children of Men"" and his zero-g wizardry on ""Gravity"". With ""Roma"", he presents a story of a smaller scale, that of a simple maid with her base desires and human dreams. His craft remains deceivingly technical. Cameras pan through the corridors of the family house, up stairs, and down driveways. Frolicking on the street with zooming VW Super Beetles and wide Mercurys. Surf crashing on an empty beach. Cuarón's scenes are perfectly set with a peaceful focus while chaos erupts all around, be that the happy noise of life, a sob of regret, or the fury of a riot.However, it is the world happening in the background that is entirely more appealing than the quiet existence of Cleo, the worker/nanny of the house. Yes, ""Roma"" is Cleo's slice of life tale, but the day-to-day intrigue of the family's dissolving, not to mention the political underpinnings of Mexico City circa 1971, are tempting and raw in ways that Cleo's polite smile are harmless and safe. Safe, in the end, might make for a nice happy ending, but not always a compelling movie.Obviously Cuarón wants to showcase such documentation as proof that workers like Cleo or his own nanny, Libo, are not silent; that their tale is just as important. As a narrative, Cuarón fails in this regard. The audience might like Cleo, and perhaps even understand her, but her meandering storyline is a small shadow on an otherwise rich tapestry.",Roma

The powerful scenes in the film can really grab a hold on viewers' emotions, especially from the female perspective. While the film takes place in Mexico, I think it's message is relevant to all Latin America. The symbolism that the director added in to foreshadow the events to come were amazing, done in such a subtle way that you're left thinking about it after the events they warn about take place. I've heard many say that one has to familiarize themselves with 1970's Mexico to fully understand this film. While I'm not up to date on my knowledge of this subject, I still was able to grasp the message and story the director was telling. It's the human experience for many really at the end of the day.

Actually I watched about 20 minutes and my wife watched a little more. I was a tiny bit interested when the Dad comes home and fits his oversized car into his undersized garage (where was the space for the lawn mower?) But I had to really stretch to be interested in even that scene.At about the 15 minute mark, I was thinking: ""Does my wife like this? Is that possible?"" Little did I know that she was just wondering how long it would take for one of us to spring up and yell ""This is crap - I'm done with it."" Fortunately I did not have to display my cinematic ignorance by doing that - I was saved by a call from a telemarketer - I saw that the call was from Waukegan Illinois - so I turned to my wife and said:""I have to take this."" 45 minutes later I finally left the telemarketer off the line and was relieved when I went back in and saw that the film had disappeared from our tv.When the ""signature shot"" is clothes drying on a line, you know you are in trouble.All I can say is a movie has to have something going on beyond panning and great cinematography - on it is just a travelogue.

192,madanmarwah,Superb cinematography but slow and monotonous for average audience,7,4 August 2021,"For some reason I couldn't see this much hyped and much awarded movie earlier. I can understand why a large number of reviewers have found the movie slow and boring. The plot is about a teenaged girl house help Cleo and her mistress Marina of a middle class home in Mexico. Both women are maltreated by their partners and have forged a bond.The movie has a number of long scenes relating to household activities like sweeping, washing, cleaning. The film opens with the credit titles against extended scenes of swish of water for washing the floor. Mundane scenes of household chores follow. An attractive feature of the movie is the Band W format which gives it a realistic look specially in the scenes of the muddy roads in suburbs, the fire in the woods, the childbirth in the hospital and the student protest. But can Mr Alfonso justify showing the help cleaning dog pooh in the name of art ?In some ways the movie appears to be an artistic exercise of self indulgence by Director Alfonso Cuaron. He is the writer, director, cinematographer and editor of this movie and hence fully involved in its making. Nothing wrong here but every film director has to to ensure that the film he/she makes must be interesting and absorbing for the common audiences. Director Alfonso fails in this aspect. In every movie there has to be a balance of "" form"" and ""content"" but Alfonso appears to leaning heavily on the ""form"" aspect .( I also feel that maybe the voting members of the Oscar and BAFTA committees who have reviewed and selected the film for an award do not represent the common audiences.)
The movie however is a delight for all lovers of cinematography, editing and sound recording. The signature style of Alfonso is there in every frame including the long duration static shots with the artistic use of light and shade, the highly mobile camera with the beautiful panning shots and the superb tracking shots ( Dolly, Robotic arm, steadicam). The tracking shots in the streets are stellar. Full marks to Alfonso for designing and framing these shots each of which can be appreciated by freezing the frame. The continuous long duration shot at the beach near the end of the movie with Cleo and the children is a visually a masterpiece. All these scenes are a feast for the initated but mean nothing much for the common film goer who is looking for entertainment and is now bored with the scenes of domestic and mundane issues throughout.",Roma

195,richarddillomes,This is what extraordinary cinema is all about.,8,7 October 2019,"After giving us 2013's 'Gravity' starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, Alfonso Cuaron now gives us 'Roma,' a semi-autobiographical take on his childhood but with their housekeeper Cleo as the main character. Set in the 70's in his neighborhood Roma, Mexico (if you thought Italy, you're not alone,) Cuaron shot on location for the most part which added to the authentic feel the movie wanted to convey, alongside the impressive storytelling via the composition of his shots (he's the Cinematographer as well!) wherein the camera pans from one side to another following a character's movement giving you the experience that you are inside the movie as an observer rather than outside looking in. Between 'The Favourite' and this, I'd be hard-pressed to choose which will win Best Cinematography, especially after seeing the tracking shot taken for the beach scene which leads to the movie poster of the film: all of them embracing with the sun just behind them all in their black and white glory. If there's a Best Scene Award that captures a magical moment in movie 'Roma' will win it hands down.Another possible magic moment for the movie is it can become the first ever to win both Best Picture and Best Foreign film simultaneously, and first Best Picture win for streaming service Netflix. Other nominations include Best Director (possible win!), Actress and Supporting Actress, Original Screenplay, Production Design, Sound Editing and Mixing. Last year's Best Director and fellow Mexican filmmaker Guillermo Del Torro was all praises for the movie, highlighting how Cuaron exerted epic effort for an intimate story: ""In these, our troubled times, he speaks about characters that are invisible and dramas that go unspoken, and thus he provides us with the most urgent of antidotes: empathy.""For all intents and purposes I do agree with Del Toro, and my only minor critic is the screenplay. The story of 'Roma' is something I have seen over and over and over again in different permutations by way of telenovelas and movies in the Philippines, mostly because we share the same class structure with Mexico, middle-class families can afford to hire housekeepers some stay on for a long period of time leading them to become accepted as part of the family. We even have domestic helpers working in different parts of the world whose stories are very similar to Cleo's. In the end though, I appreciate that 'Roma' taught me that even if a story has been told a million times over, it can be retold a million and one way more as long as there's a sense of purpose in doing so, which is what set Cuaron on this journey: a way to honor her nanny Libo, a woman who gave her life to caring for him and his family, another woman that made his life better just by being in it.

There are stories in each of us. Drama too. And consequently, art. What beauty or order do you bring to your own personal drama? How do you direct it? Percieve it? Embrace it? Love it? Even the most tragic aspects of our lives are beauty when percieved as art.",Roma
197,leftistcritic,"Terrible movie supposedly about ""class in Mexico""",2,19 January 2019,"I watched this movie late last year and will try to recount it the best I can. The movie is set in 1970s Mexico, I believe, with rampant class inequality. A few maids work for a well-off bourgeois family, one of whom is the focus of part of the story. She works very hard and without much recognition by her employers, this bourgeois family, who demean her, as does her boyfriend who is an ass to her. She is almost a slave to this family. Almost in a sick way the movie focuses inordinately on her pregnancy, including on her stillbirth and saving the children of the bourgeois family. The movie ends with little change in her life while she (or any of the characters) supposedly don't take part in the turmoil in the country for the most part. All in all, this movie was a waste of time.I guess what annoyed me the most about film, apart from what I said in the previous paragraph, is that it was in black-in-white. In general, in this age of color film, it makes no sense to make a movie in black-in-white about the 1970s when if the film had come out at that time then it would have been in color! So, that's a major error on the part of the director and all those making this film. While some people liked this film for one reason or another, it obviously was over-hyped just like the recent report by special counsel Robert Mueller as the Democrats shout ""Russia! Russia! Russia!"" and have nothing to show for it, just grumbling along the way.In the end, this film was more depressing than not. I'm not saying the film has to end with a happy ending with everyone smiling as I've watched enough Ken Loach films, like Kes (1967), Raining Stones (1993), Ae Fond Kiss (2004), The Wind That Shakes the Barley (2006), and I, Daniel Blake (2016) to know that films do not have to have happy endings. But, there should have at least been a ray of hope provided to the viewer. Otherwise watching the film or even recommending others see it is a waste of time as the impact of the film fades away like pedals falling off a flower. With that I end my review and stand with my rating of 2 out of 10.",Roma

199,filmtravel101,Great Cinema but Boring Dull Story - like a Short Story dragged into 2 hours,5,29 December 2018,"This film is mostly for cinephiles and film students and of course film critics
as the cinematography is fantastic and the camera work/music score also so be prepared as otherwise you might be shocked at the snail pace of the film.The story itself is rather dreadfully lacking with over 90 minutes of painfully nothing except odd non emotional characters almost like a Fellini film on prozac instead of acid and at the end you leave with some emotional shifts due to obvious issues and some quirky characters but the rest of the movie is so devoid of emotion it makes you almost wonder if this slice of life of Mexico in the 70s is totally unrealistic and specific to only the directors microcosm. Latin people are emotional with flare but this film has them all on anti depressant pills except maybe the Mother. It is definitely shocking that it is nominated for best screenplay as that is plainly absurd so be prepared for exceptional minimalism and an almost Terrence Malick-like beautiful flowing panning images that are stunning yet one might fall asleep wondering what is the point of this film. Is it about irresponsible men, womens struggles, loss of children, or the director really wanted to send a big thank you to his Nanny for saving his life from drowning and stretched it 135 minutes with other fillers. A wonderful tribute and it captures Mex City in the 70s with great details yet not a masterpiece like his film Gravity that was quite unique or even as creative as Y tu Mama tambien. And please be prepared for an endless amount of time spent on bad drivers trying to park in tight spaces, garages that are almost too painful to watch. The poor cars need some serious TLC.Regardless a wonderful film if one is prepared for a slow moving almost paint drying dull 2 hours and then suddenly something happens and some might feel connected while others might feel there is a reason indy films ended up losing so much money and theatres closing as few of the general public will pay $15+ to watch an esoteric 65mm film like this.. and thankfully Netflixs takes on such artistic films - so kudos to them and to the director for putting out there such a private film that takes big cojones - even if rather dull it is a skilled auteur master that surely will make more stylish films to come.I give it a 5 as hard to imagine so many people giving it a 10 or 8 except to inspire other filmmakers to make some quality films in Hollywood that are a bit more entertaining with decent storytelling.",Roma

However days after I saw it I kept going back to the film and thinking about her life, the life of the family she worked for, the loss of her child, the timing of the events and tragedies. I feel that when I have seen a movie and weeks later I am still thinking about it - then it is a good film.
I know that this took place in the 1970's and in some ways there are still things like this happening in some countries.
My problem with it - the blandness of the main character - she so rarely showed any emotion. And that was probably due to the way it would have been - apparently the director based this film on a maid who cared for him growing up.
At first I did not like the parents in the family she worked for and since then I have come to appreciate the mother and her struggles more.

208,Eclectic-Boogaloo,Beautiful but ill-defined,5,17 January 2019,"There were two great stories in this movie, both of which were done a disservice by Alfonso Cuarón's misguided belief that visual storytelling is a replacement for screenwriting craft. Roma had way too thinly drawn a script to properly service the multiple plot threads and themes at play. Cuarón wasted too much screen time lingering over shot, after shot, after shot, instead of fleshing out his script.I enjoyed the story of the poor indigenous maid, an empathetic Yalitza Aparicio, even though the story was thin and drawn out. I was genuinely affected by it. So that aspect of the film worked. What didn't was the story of the upper middle class white family and leftists being oppressed by the Mexican government, or government sponsored militia. The latter subject matter wasn't given a thorough enough treatment. There was a lot of screen time wasted on the rich families drama. Didn't need it. Didn't care. The film would have been better off using that time to flesh out its bigger ideas.But I must admit that it's a beautiful looking film with one terrific performance (the aforementioned).

The direction, cinematography, production design, sound and sound mixing are in compass to make a beautiful harmonious work of art. There's not an original score for this film which it makes it stand alone, instead Cuarón has used pieces of radio hit songs from that era, as part of the environmental scene. It's well crafted screenplay perfectly works with the acting of every cast in Roma, especially with the two leads in the film. Aparicio and Tavira are magnificent portraying a passage in the life of 1970's middle class Mexican family. It's simple, and real.

It captures the chaos of the world around the main characters and uses it to enhance the story beneath the surface. Every frame is packed with detail, sometimes to the extent that one loses track of the main characters for a while, enticed by the peripheral yet exigent events of the greater world.From a critical perspective, I look favorably upon any work of art that tells a story with more detail than I can absorb in a single viewing. The best movies are those that can be seen over and over again and offer a new experience each time, a cornucopia for those willing to look closer. This film does not demand repeat viewings - it tells a clear story, with a clear end - but it will entice the critic to zoom in, to examine every shot and every scene, foreground to background. This film is an exhibition of stark realism, such that few filmmakers can capture as adeptly as Cuarón.",Roma

But if you are eager for some soap opera kind of movie forget about it. This is not that kind of movie.

Cuaron doesn't frame the screen so you know what to look at, and thia leads to some great payoff, as the scenws with the newspaper stand, where you really feel like one of the characters, lost in the bustle and not knowing if they really saw what (or who) thry think they saw.The story is so interesting and complex that it feels difficult to believe that it was based on a real story, much less one from Cuarons own life.The emotional wallops land with full force, and you really feel how the characters feel.

It shows the life of a maid and what it's like for her to go through a few traumatic events and I mean really traumatic events. The problem is that I could recognize how terrible what happens to her is but I didn't empathize as much as I feel like I should have. The emotion of the film doesn't match the emotion of the events taking place. Cleo never really comes off as anything other than something to be pitied and I don't think it should be like that. She is clearly an incredibly strong and dedicated woman but the film doesn't show us that. We have to use logic to deduce how strong this woman is. Her story is interesting and dramatic but it isn't portrayed in a way that keeps the viewer occupied. Mostly, nothing happens in the movie except for a couple moments of intense drama. The visuals are nice and there are some legitimately fantastic looking shots but most of the appeal, for me, comes from the fact that it's filmed with such a high resolution camera.

226,BillSims28,"Exquisite, Achingly Beautiful, Refreshingly Human",9,12 February 2019,"Alfonso Cuarón has clearly had 'Roma' rattling around his creative head ever since his film-obsessed childhood in Mexico City, which forms the basis behind this masterpiece of filmmaking. The film is entirely black & white, with a stripped-back narrative that excels in extracting beauty from mundanity.Cuarón has always ensured his films such as the masterful 'Children of Men' and 'Gravity' are shot impeccably, usually with the help of expert Emmanuel Lubezki. For 'Roma', however, he takes over DP duty himself. In doing so, he showcases his considerable skill by focusing on gorgeous slow pans and improbably long takes. This really is one of the most aesthetically pleasing films I've seen: any given shot could be framed.The minimalist plot - essentially a series of delicately-constructed vignettes chronicling the relationship between a Mixtec maid and the family she works for - allows for deeper exploration of character. Schoolteacher Yalitza Aparicio had never acted before this, but you wouldn't know it from the astonishing degrees of pain and love which she exhibits. The family she lives with is one of the most natural ever put to film, featuring a group of children free of the cloying sentimentality displayed by trained Hollywood child actors. Marina de Tavira is equally impressive as a matriarch struggling with her marriage. Every small event which the characters experience feels monumental in the context of the story, due to the effort which has gone into developing the characters in a realistic, fulfilling manner.The film's dialogue is also consistently grounded in humanity, and the script even gets the chance to explore some absurdist comedy during a martial arts scene. The lasting sensation of the film, however, is one of melancholic beauty. I was left overwhelmed by the intensely personal nature of it: it is at times akin to reading the diary of someone detailing intimate family secrets. The film also manages to evoke tears, and is one of those rare pieces which can do so without sweeping, moving music or heartfelt dialogue.This is by no means a film to be watched lightly, and is not conducive to casual watching: many people will be understandably put off by what is essentially watching exquisitely beautiful paint dry.

228,Metaflix,Vividly shot but overrated,7,27 December 2018,"There are a few undeniable things about 'Roma.' It's amongst the most gorgeously shot black and white films on record, which is all the more impressive considering Alfonso Cuarón serves as the film's writer, director, AND cinematographer. There's also no distinguishing between fiction and reality. In particular, the actors in the movie make this slice-of-life film feel like it's a biography. And finally, if 'Roma' indeed goes on to win the Oscar for Best Picture--right now it's certainly a contender--it'll eventually be saddled with the reputation of being undeserving of the honor, much like 'Crash' or 'Shakespeare In Love.'The bottom line is that no matter how vividly shot a picture may be (*cough cough* Terrence Malick), without an engaging plot, everything else is just cinematic masturbation.Lastly, a point of privilege: one reviewer fawned over Alfonso Cuarón's camerawork, setting expectations rather high. However, while a number of sequences are indeed wonderfully shot, basic left-to-right or right-to-left pans aren't exactly innovative. For comparison, watch 'Shoplifters' while paying special attention to camera placement and movement. It's nothing short of extraordinary and likely the best camera work of any film this year.",Roma
229,nikxatz,Alfonso Cuaron's tribute to life and death is mesmerising,9,6 November 2018,"I watched Roma at TIFF ( Thessaloniki International Film Festival). The whole theater was full and the expectations from the general public were high. The opening scene was so imersive and could feel that this film would be unique. And,as usual, I wasn't wrong.
The way the film is shot adds so mutch to the experience. There are hundreds of shots that are hardly forgotten and the way certain scenes are lighted is truimphant. The whole movie is a painting, a feast for the eye and you must watch on the big screen to enjoy it
As for the story, Roma is a philosophical, emotional film that uses symbolism to talk about themes such as the ups-and-down of life, the meaning of family and loyalty to eachother and the people that come and go in our lives.
The way certain characters are introduced is so genius (pay attention at the parking scenes). Also, some hints in the backround say a lot about the flm's themes (the constant appearance of airplanes inthe sky). The first too acts are slow and built up for what's to come, because the third act isa total tour de force!
The sound editing andsound mixing is well done really well too! It uses 360 sound effects to immerse you in its painful, but beautiful world. The sound of the water and of the waves is awesome too.
My only issue is probably the fact that if you are paying attention to the film and understand the symbolism, you can easily understand th arc of the main character and that leaves you kind of unenthused.
Overall, Roma is a mature, profound and extremelly well-shot film by a director who has left his mark in every movie genre and I wouldn't be upset if it won the Best Picture or the best Cinematography.
It is a piece of art dedicated to the ones we love and the oneswe miss and shows that even the worst of experiences can mae us wiser and offer us an opportunity to a better life.Must-watch

235,lumieretrain,Roma by Alfonso Cuarón,9,24 February 2019,"Releasing movies about the chronicle of a family, is unique to explore how the main characters would be close with each other. For the bond that would not let them be separated by anything, neither from the most tragic happening to be even shocking. Most of these stories are told in the point of view, of one or more characters who would build the stories. To see then which decision the main characters would take in the end, either to stay with their family or leaving them to hope by finding a better life. The auteur filmmaker Alfonso Cuarón uses this element for his new project, but set in Mexico where he is from. In 2018 came out Roma by Alfonso Cuarón, which is his eight movie. The movie's plot: the chronicle of a middle-class family's maid in early 1970s. The movie is filled with Mise-en-scène, which would make the scenes poetic like a painting. Especially when the camera keeps rolling for some of the long takes, to catch the audience attention without let them be distracted. The black and white color would create scenarios, by making them emotional and unforgettable. The editing has been specifically elaborated, to maintain the narration of the story without ruining the rhythm. The movie is spoken in Spanish and Mixtec which make the movie realistic, to see how the main characters would express their emotions. Usually is expected to hear soundtracks, to feel the emotions of the scenes. Instead the movie does not have any original soundtrack, but uses the sounds to feel the realism of the story. The actress Yalitza Aparicio did an excellent performance, as the maid of the middle-class Family, Cleodegaria ""Cleo"" Gutiérrez. Cleo would build the story as it is told most of the time in her point of view, as she is the one who would be so important for the family to take part of it. Roma is one of the best 2018's movies, also one of the best Afonso Cuarón's masterpieces.",Roma

237,rogier-86785,Epic by not being epic,10,9 February 2019,"Roma does something impossible: it captures a normal life and makes it into a brilliant movie. They pull this off by reinventing the art of film itself, bringing you so close to its characters, you just get hooked. Where do I begin?The story is about a maid working for a big family in Mexico City in the 70s. Basically, it's not special. At all. But the audiovisual portrayal of her life is so vivid, you get sucked into the screen. How? Well, it pulls two amazing tricks.Visually this is a stunning, stunning film. That's the first trick, best described as actual 'screen-glue'. The shots are gorgeous, wide, perfect sepia colored and almost painterly-like. They have a Van Gogh like quality. It's hypnotizing.Trick number two is: there is no film score. The lack of music means we get the feeling we are experiencing real life instead of a film. In real life, even in its most emotional moments, there is also no music. Which makes the films dramatic - and even its mundane - events seem even more real.It makes you wonder why so few have thought of this before. It all combines into something that can only be described by the word real. I don't think I've ever been closer to characters in a movie. Just because of how it is filmed. That's why the critics are gasping over Roma: it raises the bar.The general public is a little bit less impressed because the story seems like nothing particularly special. But I have to disagree. It really is quite heavy. But the drama stems from real life, which makes it like a gut punch.That's the whole point: apparently we can make films about real life that can leave us utterly mesmerized. For that alone you should watch it. I'm still struggling to put it into words exactly. It's hard to put your finger on it. But ultimately, Roma is epic. By not being epic.",Roma

Transforming memories into the big screen never looked this good. It's a heartwarming story that will leave you in tears. Yalitza's portrayal of the main character is brilliant. With incredible set designs and innovative camera work, 1970's Mexico is portrayed flawlessly.The director Alfonso Cauron is a genius, the same mastermind that shifted the tone of the Harry Potter movies from childish to haunting.

Not done.
If you knew the real bad cases you would laugh at this movie like a frustrated political attempt about rising some kind of awareness.

240,CinePendejo,I liked it.,8,16 December 2018,"Lord knows how much we owe to Alfonso Cuarons achievement as a filmmaker. Starting as a curiosity, then a flash in a pan, but then all of a sudden a critical darling, all of his efforts evoke a bold, minutely assembled quality. Paired with elaborate one-shot sequences, pseudo-veriteé dialogue, indulgent moments of artistic symbolism, and bits and pieces of socio-political commentary, he's willing to take the independent film scene by storm.So it's no surprise to see ROMA currently leading the Metacritic charts of 2018. And it often deserves that high praise; it's gorgeously shot, wonderfully acted, achingly heartbreaking yet sympathetic, full of memorable scenes, and holds a great sense of visual and symbolic filmmaking. Cuarón seems to have a lot of his mind while making this movie - about class, miserable mothers, war, protest, and dwindling innocence - all while taking notes from other acclaimed movies of the past decade to culminate it together.And yet there's just a small thing missing from it. Even as I nearly loved all the shots and moments of emotional ballast, I felt as though Cuarón is trying too hard? Maybe it's how often his camera lingers on some scenes, or how he clutters a lot of extras and action in one pan shot, or how there's one outlandishly grandiose moment after another in tandem to Mexican socioeconomic commentary.There's a lot of heart into this movie, but I just wished it relaxed a bit and stop trying to be, well, perfect? The scenes that mostly stick out to me were when Yalitza Aparicios character Cléo goes through their relatable and stripped-down character journey. There's no flashy panache or anything, just a maid doing her best to do her job while life flings at her face.Maybe I'm asking for too much. Maybe I should be grateful ROMA gets the recognition movies like these need, especially during these harsh times. And for the record, it does outright look like a masterpiece in some cases - that beach scene will stick with me for days. But sometimes it just slightly pales in compared to the captivatingly raunchy Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN and the action-movie-with-big-ideas charm of CHILDREN OF MEN.But please relax, guys. I liked it.",Roma

She did have some time off, enough to get involved with a bad lover.The father's love of a big big car that could not get into the garage without damage was amusing, but how likely in a supposed professor?While the family, minus the absent randy dad, was nice the movie still made me stronger than ever in my dislike of LATINO culture.",Roma

246,GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator,You will fall in love in Roma,9,21 September 2018,"The most stunning and poetic-beautiful film I have ever seen. Every single shot of the film feels like a character. The continuously-long shots show so much is going on in the backgrounds from the sounds and images of crowds of people, dogs barking, birds chirping to even planes flying by. These don't feel like distractions because the way Cuaron shoots them (also as his own cinematographer this time) makes them feel like they are these moving pieces of art. As the camera slowly pans through the inside of the family's house and the outside of the city and landscapes of the Mexican country, Cuaron's ability to show-not-tell immerses you into family's daily routines but also into the political climate where it reaches a boiling point in a very climatic scene. The digitally-shot black and white imaginery makes Roma feel like you step into old photograph get re-mastered and then was turned into a moving picture.But it is what's in the foreground that is what really captures our attention in the main character Cleo (a great breakout performance from Yalitza Aparicio). She is the maid to this family that lives next door and takes of their house and children. She has become so accustomed to her work routine that she practically cares and looks after the kids as if they were here own family. And family is definitely the theme to best described this film. Throughout the story the father is rarely ever there as though he does not exist. And the lack of one parental figure has certain affects on Cleo's relationship with the kids and the mother, for better and worse. As the audience watches Cleo and become more invested in her personal life throughout the story, the changes in her emotional state begins to affect you.Roma is a film packed with so many tones and emotions. There are many moments that are awkward, funny and quirky. These moments allow these characters to feel comfortable enough to show their spontaneous and optimistic sides. And then there are some where the story takes dark turns that deliver one hell of an emotional gut-punch. And by the end you feel just went through rollercoaster of emotions.I saw this film at TIFF this month and while this film is produced by Netflix to be part of their streaming service, I highly recommend you see it in theatres first, if it gets a wide theatrical release this year, because it deserves to be seen on the biggest screen with great sound quality enveloping a large room. Don't let the first time you watch Roma be on your phone or tablet.",Roma
247,briefexistance,"Emotion, realism and intensity",10,13 December 2018,"I went to my local cinema to watch this film, it was around 4 pm, and when it ended, it was around 6:15. I live in central Mexico, the sunset was setting with beautiful yellowish-red clouds, the elote-guy was there, serving ""esquites"" or ""chascas"", and the local camote men passed through my house later that night... It was, refreshing, reinvigorating how for the first time in my entire life, a movie made me look my usually boring and small hometown, in a different but really, really beautiful way. It was the first time, that I felt really proud, really happy to be in the place I was, that showed me how my country is enriched with culture, struggle, aesthetic and paraphernalia you won't find anywhere else in the world. Close to the cinema there are some old offices with that aesthetic of the late 80s, kind of similar to the ones presented here. To me, going into the cinema theater and then going out to the real-life scenario, for the first time, I felt how it was merged and enhanced. My perspective was intensified, everything was more vivid and beautiful to the point I just wanted to cry.After this introduction to my own personal experience, wow. The movie... The film was just, in a few words: extremely captivating, mystical, beautiful, raw, sad, aesthetic, poetic. Basically, a truthful and real portrayal of the urban post-modernist Mexico, with a main story of the lives of 2 Mexican woman with different backgrounds that share similar struggles.My only critique, to be honest, is that, I would really loved if the movie showed us and enhanced, a bit more of Cleo's indigenous background, because that's a huge part of Mexico's enriched cultural personality; but I guess Cuaron's intention was not to get too deep in this aspect of the country, but instead to show how us how a urban-middle class family woman helper gets intertwined with very intense emotional struggles in the late 60s.The director not only stays there, in the depiction of the strength of the Mexican housewife and help woman that we sometimes undervalue; But also, he show us the less appealing component of Mexico, where violence and corruption is omnipresent every-single-day in our lives. In here, he recreates a glance of this reality, where to be honest, I got torn apart by its intensity and rawness, representing one of the most important political and infuriating scenarios we've had in quite some time: the 1968 student's protest that ended up in a slaughterhouse. I also saw some slight critique to the neglectful aspects of the medical care system of the country, the IMSS, but I don't know, maybe it was just my interpretation.And beyond all of the madness, chaos and sadness, to contrast we get the surrounding in peaceful and aesthetic scenes of the whole drama, with beautiful shades of the urban Mexico City, of the rural Estado de México and the stunningly poetic woods in (i think) some small ranch in Michoacán. Everything in this piece of art is magnificent: to the acting of the indigenous-rising star Yalitzia Aparicio, superb directing, captivating camera work, photography and of course, the script! I just think it was an amazing portrait with astonishing execution. Left my eyes peeled towards the sky, and towards my heart. Deserves all recognition it's currently having, do not be deceived. It deserves it.
I cannot believe Cuarón went from the plain one dimensional hollywood production in Gravity, to this. To Roma. To a masterpiece of Mexican cinema.You're a cabrón, Alfonso!",Roma

249,roondogbb,Amazing piece of Cinema,10,4 May 2021,"Roma is a movie that I feel a person will either love or simply be bored by. Depending on your specific taste of movies. This isn't an action packed blocked buster (which many peoole prefer). Not by a long strech of the imagination. CGI isn't the selling point here, which is common in modern film making. Neither does heavy verbal exposition push the story along. Which is also an uncommon route to take, but the Mexican Director Alfonso Cuaron decided to take this route because he felt it was best to truely create a beautiful piece of cinema and tell it in a visually unique way. (A film that was based on his own memories of childhood in mexico city)First of, the film is in Spanish, so this may be off putting to some, there is dubs (but I feel emotion is always lost in dubbings) It's probably best to read the subtitles if possible. Or if you speak spanish. Watch in spanish. Also the film is filmed in black and white which gives it a unique look that isn't chosen by many directors of modern cinema and it helped a lot bring us back to the age that the film was set in, the 1960s.The film follows a girl called Celo who is the helper of a middle class household and it followers her life from the mundane to the more intense parts. Some of the more intense parts being her pregnancy. Visually and audibly are taken into her world. Tiny little details that wouldn't be deemed important by some directors are of the upmost importance here. The sound of dogs barking, the sound and sight of planes flying overhead. All add subtle layers to this world that cleo lives in and we are following her as she does. It makes the world feel truely alive and the world that the director was trying to create. So when emotional things happen in the film. They're very impactful. We don't need to hear words so much as listening and observing the environment can touch our soul more than words can.The film is free to watch on Netflix in a variety languages. I personally watched the film in spanish but I'm sure it's nearly as good in english too. I give this film a strong 10/10 and it deserved every award and good review that it recieved. The director was excellent. The cast were also amazing.",Roma
250,GrigoryGirl,Know what it's missing? Humanity....,4,18 December 2018,"The film is missing one thing. Humanity. A lot of people are comparing it to the neorealist films of the 1940's and 1950's, but it's only a superficial comparison. While the film is about a nanny (based on Cuaron's own experiences with his nanny), Cuaron's style is overly technical, dry, and often, just boring. It has no sense of shared humanity or poetry. The Bicycle Thief, La Terra Trema, and Umberto D had these qualities in droves. Another complaint is that the 3 neorealist films I mentioned were shot on black and white FILM. This was not shot on 65mm black and white film, but the digital Alexa 4K. While that looks nice, black and white video does not have the same depth and soul as b/w film does, and Cuaron should have known that. It gives a dystopic feel to the proceedings, and I don't think that was the intention.This is mostly a technical exercise in neorealism. I think many people want this film to be great, but it really isn't. It looks nice, but it's very shallow and too ""aware"" for its own good. It desperately wants to be an art movie, and many critics say it is, but it is not.",Roma

I did feel sympathetic towards Cleo and her employer and their respective struggles but not to the point that I actually found myself caring what really happened to them.

255,p-seed-889-188469,One for the art house crowd.,2,5 May 2019,"In the interests of full disclosure I must admit I only made it half way through this movie. Perhaps that makes my review unfair but on the other hand an hour is surely sufficient time to expect some sort of payback.We immediately know this is an arthouse movie because a) it is in ""black and white"" and b) its opening credits are possibly the longest and most boring in cinematic history. Perhaps this was just a cunning and thoughtful ploy to get all the non-arty people out of the movie theater in the first few minutes thereby saving them two hours of wasted time.Inexplicably other reviewers praise the cinematography. I could not agree less. First there IS no cinematography in the commonly accepted sense. It seems to me that the cinematography is limited to pointing the camera in the general direction of the ""action"", something that is done adequately for sure but not exactly the height of sophistication and innovation. Second, the movie is in ""black and white"". There is a reason I put ""black and white"" in quotations. Real black and white is what people used to make with black and white film, and if you want to see what this looks like, and some REAL cinematography using all the finesse and effects that black and white film allows, you could do a lot worse than watch ""The Third Man"", a masterclass in the use of lighting. ""Roma"" has evidently been filmed in colour and someone has clicked the ""convert to Black and white"" button on some software to produce this insipid parody of black and white. It has such a limited dynamic range there is virtually no contrast and it should more accurately called ""grey and white"". I found it incredibly difficult to watch and impossible to pick out any detail. Technicalities aside we might reasonably ask why a film set in the 70s should be made in ""black and white"" at all. What exactly was the point in this decision?We might equally well ask the same of the plot - was there actually any point? We are presented with about a dozen characters none of whom we get close to. They are all just cardboard cutouts that we see as props rather than characters than we can empathize with and root for. I really don't care about the Doctor and his wife's problems because I don't know who they are. Ditto, the two maids. Where did they come from? Why should I care? We see them go through their daily routines but, well, so what? One of them suddenly finds herself in a hotel room with a virtual stranger waving a curtain rail about. Of course she gets pregnant. But who is she? Why did she just jump into bed with a stranger? We will never know because we don't know her as a person. It is all very intellectual and distant.Roma is not a ""bad"" movie as such but it is extremely pretentious and seemingly made for the gratification of the director rather than for an actual audience.",Roma
256,filmesfodasticos_by_jorgemarin,ROMA IS MONUMENTAL AND ORDINARY,10,6 June 2019,"Rome is one of the most impressive movies of this century. Meticulous, grandiose and thrilling, the direction and cinematography of Alfonso Cuarón achieve the feat of re-creating the culture of the 1970s in Mexico City under the simple-minded perspective of a faithful domestic servant without losing a single important detail.Although the camera follows all the moves of Cleo, also nanny of the four children of the couple António and Sofia, the view that we have of the large-format open plans is always from the bottom up, as if we shared with one of the children (probably the director) the admiration of monumental scenes, like the waves of the sea, which constitute, for an adult, dayly ordinary facts.Roma was a middle-class neighborhood with luxurious homes and staffs of maids, cooks, babysitters and drivers. From dawn on, when she wakes up the children to school, until dusk, when she turns out the lights, Cleo seems to attend to all desires, serving meals, cleaning the dog Borras' droppings, washing all the clothes and whispering with the cook Adela in the Mixtec dialect.The meticulous and safe way in which the master introduces the powerful Galaxy 500 into the tight hallway that serves as a garage is a phallic symbolism that indicates a patriarchal and masculine predominance in all the conflicts of the plot. Abandoned by him, Mrs. Sophie will say about women ""we are all alone.""Interchangeable in the daily routine, there are defining moments, such as the father's trip without return, an earthquake, a broken window in a fight, a fire at New Year's party and the (almost) drowning of children in the Tuxpan sea. One of the most poignant scenes, Cleo's delivery by real doctors and nurses, comes just after one of Mexico's greatest tragedies, the Halconazo, when dozens of students were massacred by paramilitaries in 1971 Corpus Christi.At the end of the film, the family returns to the house once more.

You care about the characters and are interested in their goings. It has a lot to say about the exploitation of women and class structure doesn't discriminate in that regard.

So while there isn't a lot of action plot wise there is always two or three images to process and appreciate how they complement portrayal of cleo and the family. It's a masterpiece. My only complaint is sometimes it gets manipulative and heavy handed. The wedding being celebrated behind Sofía's family after she just told them their father is leaving is an example of this. So is the car that is too big for her to drive so she downsizes.Which is supposed to show how overwhelmed her relationship was and how much control she possesses with him gone.

261,srd-30659,It is that film that will stay with you for ever,9,20 December 2018,"A rich family, a large house, a bunch of kids of all ages, a chaotic household, a dog and chiks and birds to complete the anarchic life, Roma tells the story of a maid whose life is woven around the family, who is loved almost like a family member and the kids love her too. She is made pregnant by a passing through irresponsible young man but loses the baby. The mistress of the house loses her husband to another woman. The employee and the employer suffer fate of love in separate ways but the distinction between the rich and poor doesn't count. This rich, placid almost uneventful and yet eventful life is what makes Roma so different and so cinematically unique. The camera watches from a distance but watches it closely.
The movie begins with water poured on the entrance passage and makes it reflect the sky where a plane passes overhead in the sky. The credits roll in the end against the sky between tall building structures when you see planes one by one passing overhead in the sky. This passing of aeroplanes in the sky repeats in many frames. Does Alfonso Cuaron want to convey something through this? I don't know. The rumble of passing plane is creatively used in the soundtrack which is minimal, unobtrusive and yet significant.
The pace of the film is measured which makes it grow into you. The tragic events are not overbearing and yet significant in the lives of maid and her mistress.
The monochrome photography enhances the effect of the images which colour would have taken away the thoughtfulness behind them.

Azkaban and Gravity are also extremely excellent. I mean studios would be willing to give out a high production cost to him for a blockbuster and he chooses to make this!! Other directors are always complaining that the studio isn't giving them enough money to make their movie. Cuaron would not face that problem.

265,ReadingFilm,New dimensions in cinema,10,31 March 2019,"A theater of memories inside the filmic textures. The camera almost feels like a ghost's eyes wandering across an exaggerated reality. So I emphasize the piece as 'heightened theater'. It hijacks us inside the magical banal. Cuaron being hollywood is just bizarre for how he sees versus coverage by committee. Though we should not take points away for his abilities to 'connect' rather examine how he serves every strata. Always these films, once they get going and time passes, we fall in love. But the restless cinema here points to a film of the future that a lot of his contemporaries are leading as well with the sheer variety and methods in seeing. It is not satisfied with itself or smug. I like how he is not like Malick who tries to reinvent seeing. Its foundation is theater making it extremely pleasing, and spoils us in black and white. You live inside it. He is too human to be the machine-like filmmaker so the tour is not of space, or the time, or across memories; all of which it hints... rather it tricks you with its texture, he shoots blockbusters afterall, so hangs the film on the protagonist's interconnection. This is where it steers oddly via the class divide, in my opinion avoiding there being a brutal disconnect through its wisdom. But this maid is so morally at highground that her position is unavoidably a powerful symbol: when she is unhappy, I despise these people. When she is happy, I'm happy. The undercurrent of her contentness betrays our yearning for this underdog revolution, it can be argued there is an abuse of the filmmaking power how it does not give her any sort of victory. Inherently, it can't avoid me thinking of this. You can't point the camera to this and not see it's about have's and have nots. Of course it is Cuaron's memory summation achievement ala Truffaut, Fellini, Jodorowsky as every auteur is entitled, but via his sheer amount of industry power brings a certain luxuriousness that I thought it is too wise to ring true. How it clicked is when I realized he knows this; he is the boy looking back on a neorealist fever dream; meaning he is aware of every gray area, is guilty and with us wishing better for her, in agreement with every outrage. Your discomfort is his accountability. Roma is a future holographic cinema of conscience and consciousness. A love letter with scale to a faltering medium, a Picasso on screen.",Roma

267,Anttell,Life's beautiful,7,25 January 2019,"I liked Roma. Obviously it looks great, it also has elements of an epic family saga, although it doesn't quite hit that note fully, kinda wish the film would have been longer for a bigger impact in that regard. More importantly Roma has a liberating aura - life's a chaos where undesirable things happen, but in the end you'll survive. For me, the film had the potential to be a grand study of life, but it's more of an essay the way it is, still good.I've yet to see a masterpiece from Cuaron, but have immense respect for him for tackling different genres - versatility is highly admirable, whether we're talking about directors, actors or film buffs for that matter.Rating: 7/10",Roma
268,novacasa42,A fine piece of craft,10,7 January 2019,"Cuaron's Roma is undoubtedly one of the best realistic films throughout history, I say this because you'll find yourself lost in Roma, so immersed with how things are happening in a tedious way, much like life itself, that aspect of realism is fully captured by Cuaron as he presents us with an insight so vivid and so clear and raw you could swear that you're watching a real-life events happening in front of you, it gives you the chance to observe and asses and more importantly feel and relate to strong emotions from pain to love and in a manner that is very genuine, in all honesty, Roma is something really special, I can't start to describe how into it I was, I loved how Cuaron chose his camera angels, to provide the maximum presence, it just flows naturally, again at times it feels all too real, and that right there is near impossible to capture in such manner, it takes and lot to make something so simple.The acting is spectacular, almost half the film we're presented with articulate shots that speaks volumes and doesn't need any dialogue to explain it, an also, Cuaron's attention to the background which is a story in and of itself.What I'm trying to say here is Roma is as pure as they come, it's like an untouched part of nature so beautiful and so wild, it demands admiration, so ultimately, Roma is a fine piece of craft and an extremely rare gem, I absolutely, completely, utterly, fully enjoyed and loved this film, the power of film doesn't get stronger than this.",Roma
269,ahicks-2,A Neo-realist Epic Masterpiece,10,25 November 2018,"ROMA is so not much the luminous recollection of the past stressed by many as a neo-realist panorama intensified by an raptuously detailed recapture of things past. It differed from most neo-realist masterpieces --BICYCLE THIEVES, LA TERRA TREMA-- not only in the radiance imbuing every detail because of obsessive recollection, but in the the social range of its vision, which encompasses all social classes and addresses issues of patriarchal and racial as well as class injustice. It not only delivers on the neo-realist concern for the the details of the physical environment -- the street scenes and work places -- of the social world, but invigorates the neo-realist language with spectacle -- the sportsfield, political demonstration and its police repression, the roar of the sea. One apparent precedent for this combination of rapturous memory, social realism and spectacle is John Ford's HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY, but ROMA is free of the Ford film's sentimental excesses - singing miners that seem ready to parade their way into a Broadway musical, familial intimacy belied by exclamatory performances.Immersive, instructive, and heartbreaking",Roma

That aside, I completely understand and share people's gripes. However, giving the movie a 1/10 is the sign of a shallow and unappreciative viewer. Yes, the story here was not very compelling to me and was outright boring for long sections. Pacing is very uneven and there litteraly is not even a plot point until the 40 minute mark.
I also understand that foiegn films have different styles, but I still think there's something fundamentally wrong with giving me as much or more screen time of people going about their daily tasks and transition shots, rather than y'know, a movie.

272,TheJohnnyPHreak,A Personal Masterpiece For Cuaron,9,20 December 2018,"I knew very little about Roma before the week it dropped on Netflix. Most of the information I had heard about it was from articles about Netflix trying to get it to play in theaters. I know that there were reports of the company trying to buy out theaters to show this as big as they could. Most film people were talking about it as this epic film from Alfonso Cuaron (Gravity, Children of Men). I was intrigued by the fact alone he was having a new film debut. He's a fantastic artist who does some very interesting things camera wise and storytelling wise with simple stories. I didn't want to read too much into what Roma, only glossing over a byline and hear minor details.This film is his masterpiece. It's also intimate, autobiography tale of a time in his life. But he's never really mentioned by name. The story follows a maid and the family she cares for in the early '70s of Mexico City. The story spans a year in her life. As the saying goes a lot can happen in a year. The film does start off slow. There is some excellent camera work and a lot of one takes that immerse the viewer in the story. About the 30 minutes in the story picks up. Cuaron does a magnificent job of investing you in these characters. IT doesn't feel like a film, it feels like watching these characters in their everyday lives. We go a window into what it's like to live in this era. He fully takes advantage of that.It would be a shame if lead actress Yalitza Aparicio who plays Cleo doesn't get some award recognition. The film is full no stars, just many actors and they all are on their game. Aparicio stands out above all. You feel for her, are scared and happy for her. The emotional range and depth she brings to the Cleo is astounding. If by the end of the film you are cheering for her and shedding tears then you might need to seek help. But the entire cast feels real, not like they are just playing parts. My favorite of them all is the youngest son who tells some fun stories to Cleo in their interactions.Cuaron proves that he is the Oscar-winning director that still has much to show us. His camera work is so good here. The long takes, tracking shots, it all fits so perfectly with the story he is telling. He even shot this film himself. Not collaborating with longtime partner Emmanuel Lubezki. It is a beautiful looking film entirely in black and white. I couldn't see this film in any other way. There is a scene during the holiday season where a group of people is trying to put out a fire in the woods, it's gorgeous. I'd be shocked if he didn't win the best cinematography award at the Oscars.Roma is all around a masterclass in filmmaking and storytelling. The cast is excellent, the story is simple but will suck you in. It's beautifully shot, heartwarming, endearing and hopefully. I would be shocked if this film didn't take home multiple Academy Awards in 2019. For sure it should win for best cinematography and best director. I would hate for this film to get relegated to the best foreign film category. This film should win for Best picture easily. And if I was on the committee it would have my vote.",Roma
273,berndgeiling,Creating Reality,10,29 April 2019,"Watching ROMA yesterday made me think about both the complexity and beauty in creating this true masterpiece of art. It makes you think you are watching a kind of documentary, but after a while, in case you are able to open up your mind and your hearts, you realize that it's a piece of highly realistic fiction, where every single frame, every picture, every actress and actor, and especially the sound causes the impression of reality itself, as if you weren't watching a movie at all. This seems to be simple, but it's an extremely difficult task, and the result is overwhelmingly successful.
There seem to be a lot of people around feeling irritated and bored by the experience of watching this movie. I know one has to understand that not everybody is able to appreciate a true work of art, but people proudly documenting their lack of empathy with what this movie offers to an open minded human being is in my opinion just a sad document of increasing ignorance, nothing else.",Roma

Applause to the director/writer/Cinematographer - Mr.Alfonso Cuaron for giving such a natural and rich movie. This movie is based on the story of Alfonso's family servant ""Libo"". When i mentioned the word ""Rich"" which means the movie is rich in its perfection of shots. Cinematography has struck me and blew my mind as each and every shots are magnificent and i paused at many instances to see the photography and was pleased by the beauty of frames.
And i knew that the movie will be a slow moving but i never felt bored as i fall in love with the DOP from the beginning itself. The Story is simple and not an extra ordinary one but a simple story has portrayed in such a way that it has evolved into a great cinematic experience. I was touched by the few scenes at the hospital and the climax. ""The Car parking shots, the cleaning shots,hospital scenes, frames at the beaches especially the climax and many "".

282,jg_1977,A beautiful passion project from one of the greatest modern directors,8,24 December 2018,"Alfonso Cuarón has officially earned the title auteur after delivering his latest film, Roma. Serving as director, writer, producer, editor, and cinematographer, Cuarón painstakingly crafted virtually every aspect of this film, himself, to match his vision. For that reason, Roma should be considered a triumph of a film. However, while watching it on Netflix, I found myself a bit detached from the story and the atmosphere that Cuarón had established. Interestingly, it is the authenticity and grounded nature of Roma that make it both so brilliantly crafted but also so hard to relate to. Although I was dazzled by what Cuarón did as a director, I felt Roma lacked in accessibility for a general audience. Roma is less of a film and more of a recreation of true life. We are never given character introductions, telling us who they are or what motivates them, just as you wouldn't if you were to meet someone for the first time in real life. Over the course of the film, the audience is given pieces here and there that give hints of backstory and motivation for the main characters, but nothing is ever brought into focus, allowing the viewer to fill in the gaps themselves. This bold technique of presenting human beings rather than movie characters is one of the ways that Cuarón constructs life as genuinely as can be done in film but also makes the movie a bit hard to relate to. Although for me, Roma didn't come together to become more than the sum of its parts, I think it is an absolute masterpiece in filmmaking that will cement Cuarón as one of the greatest living filmmakers.",Roma

285,jhmb2003,Imitation of Art,6,21 December 2018,"Rome has the particularity of being a meticulously crafted movie, with great cinematographic moments, but it lacks essential elements: a good story to tell and interesting characters. It's a film made by someone who knows the technique of cinematographic works of art very well but is incapable of bringing interest to the events or giving a deep dimension to the characters. In fact, it's frustrating how blurry the image we have of the family is, there's virtually no close-up or any emotional or revealing dialogue. The maid's character barely stands out, although due to her natural introversion and submission, her role does not grow in importance. It's not a bad film, but it lacks the artistic and intellectual honesty that the Italian films of the 50s and 60s had, to which it refers openly or veiled on several occasions. Having said that, there remain some anthological scenes, of great cinematographic power, but which are small treasures hidden in a rather conventional and scarcely entertaining story. It is enough to review a film like Pasolini's Accatone to notice the enormous difference in intensity, honesty and artistic level of the cinema to which Cuarón pays tribute.",Roma

the story and the plot are average at it's best, simple is great but uninteresting is not great, by saying that doesn't mean that Alfonso Cuaron's and his childhood maid's life is uninteresting, i just feel that he could find a better formula or maybe dig a little more deeper into his past or his heart or his writing. the taste is kinda bland for me.it could also be because of the expectation that i have for the film which is very high, but i don't know, i might rewatch it another time.",Roma

Yes, I knew Alfonso Cuaron is a talented Academy Award-winning director, but a black and white movie about a maid-I had my doubts. Well, let me tell you, this film is not for children or even the average teenager. It's not for dudes looking for a Marvel action movie, or those who love a romantic comedy. It's my guess, the best audience for this film are for those who like to be entertained by thinking, appreciate art, and are aware of two important points-this film is about the director's life while growing up. And that the title of the film, Roma, is the name of the neighborhood he lived in as a middle-class child in Mexico. That's all you need to know. From that point on you have to be patient and allow the director, who is in total control of the film, to tell you his story through vivid photography, terrific composition, detailed pacing, and touching performances. This is a small personal story told, at times, in an epic way. It's a film that if you look at it in pieces you might find yourself wondering why is the director giving so much time and focusing so much attention to the mundane. Then another sequence can be intense, another brutal. All along Mr. Cuaron is offering hints and nuances again through superb work with the camera and composition to fill in the gaps. Once you look at the film as a whole, you'll get the message.

292,alvesmarceloalves-73751,The strength of two women,8,24 December 2018,"At first glance, ""Roma"" looks like an endless 2h15min movie where nothing happens. But it is in the drama of life that lies the strength of the new film by Alfonso Cuaron.In the one-year history of the life of a middle-class Mexican family, Cuarón was able to grasp and understand that the essence of everything is in the details. She is in the expansive pain of Sofia (Marina de Tavira), whose husband changed her by the lover leaving her alone to take care of the four children. Or she is in the silent pain of Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio), a young housekeeper who finds herself involved in a problem when she becomes pregnant with a man who has just used her.The journey of love, care, pain and respect unites Sofia and Cleo, mistress and maid, worlds so different, fragments of their families that unite to maintain sanity while following the course of this often painful walk that we know as life.From the beginning Cuarón breaks the signs of this story to show the union of two women so different that they try, in a certain way, to find forces in each other as they deal with the absence and inoperability of their garbage men who left behind.""You're always alone,"" Sofia warned, at a gutter moment when she got home drunk and crashed the huge car across the walls of the narrow garage of the family home. A clear contrast to her husband's caring at the same time he did not show the same zeal with his own family.In a time of great success in the work of Elena Ferrante, the tetralogy that begins to come alive with the HBO series and tells a story of empathy and rivalry between two friends, ""Roma"" is also a story of two women so different they need support to maintain sanity. Although in this work there are not moments of rivalry, but the pain of each one that crosses the other and that empathizes on both sides.When it is expected that the film is going to show the difficulties of the maid in the face of the lack of compassion of the bosses, Cuarón shows that its film will go by another slope. It is in the reception of the mistress in front of the employee who is afraid of losing her job when she discovers that she is pregnant, which strengthens the relationship of these two women.Cleo's journey, however, is nevertheless the most interesting. As much as she feels embedded in that family, that is never her family. When you walk through the house, your steps are marked, your eyes are self-guarded, your discomfort is evident, because your home is not your home. She just feels comfortable with her sister.Maybe that's why she tried to find a love like her sister. And the association with Fermin (Jorge Antônio Guerreiro) was the worst possible, as he turns out to be someone who is not trustworthy in every respect.Cleo also finds herself in a deep discomfort with her pregnancy. She does not like it, guilt only consumes it. And only the sea cleanses her soul to the point of finally letting it out, in the midst of tears, how unwanted that son was.""Roma"" has a huge force, but it's not an easy movie. There are many slow scenes where nothing but life happens. But there is a lot of beauty in Cuarón's work. And in this journey of life, with different turning points, deep marks and the need for resignifications is that ""Roma"" is so great.",Roma

But this is not the whole story, actually technical aspects are just a complement of what is one of the greatest stories ever shown on cinema. Sadly many people here say things like ""it has no story"", ""it's boring"" and so on, how unfortunate it must be to lack the sensitivity to appreciate and properly understand a story which is as compelling as the most intricate imaginable plot. The personage of Cleo is one of the most moving, elaborated, complex and realistic in cinema history, and the interpretation of Yalitza Aparicio is of eleven out of ten, perfection made intrepretation; each of her facial expressions throughout the film describes a whole inner world so precisely that you can actually read her soul. The story may seem simple at first sight, but it is full of details of deep meaning and complexity, from the small stories of every personage to the Mexican society and urban life in a particular historical time (amazingly recreated down to the most intimate details).

Significant events of grief experienced by the main character definitely had merit but those moments total maybe 20 minutes at most of a 135 min film. In this case the very beginning of the film had an irritating whole lot of nothing scene which from the start leaves the viewer with a bad first impression and doesn't do much to prove otherwise as it goes along.

Hell, ignore this review--just sit back and experience this film for yourself.Simply put, Roma is among the richest examples of what cinema can offer.Over the brief 134-minute runtime, we grow into a family in a patient and natural way as we live and breathe their day-to-day lives in 1970s Mexico City. The film is essentially a sequence of episodes, big or small in its impact on a family, affecting characters in different ways, and told primarily through the perspective of the housemaid, Cleo (Yalitzo Aparicio). We experience hardships, love, anger, tragedy, bliss, and even the smallest of human emotions, such as childhood naïveté. And like children, we once again embrace the details of life, from collecting hail from the ground by hand as it falls from the sky to sharing a hug as last night's rain can be heard still trickling down the gutters.Written, directed, produced, filmed, and edited by Alfonso Cuarón, this is as much a personal work as it is a testament to an artist's vision and talent. It is a historically-grounded film that comes alive with Tati-esque significance reaching every corner of the frame, with camerawork so intentional that it fills our hearts with a mother's pain, an Ozu-like story that ranges from lighthearted to cathartic, and a brilliant pattern of recurring, cyclic, familiarizing setting elements that appreciates and brings into light the reality of everyday life.Perhaps one of Roma's strongest thematic undercurrents is the perseverance of women within the societal stronghold of men. With its unapologetic display of evil deeds at the expense of women going criminally unnoticed every day, Roma is, in a way, a love letter to say that Cuarón did not forget the multifaceted strength of the women in his life (it is dedicated to his nanny and, like Fellini's Roma, was inspired by his own childhood).The film's end felt like awaking from a dream. As the lights turned on, I looked around the theater, as if we have all just transported back to our own lives. Cuarón has accomplished something extraordinary here. While much of Roma comes from the memories of childhood, it is also a film that will bring each one of us back to what movies are about. And that is the greatest mark of an exceptional film.Greatest Movies of 2018 - #130 Greatest Films of All TimeDFF41 Closing Film",Roma

300,eden-rabatsch,A memory stright to the brain but will be challenging for some,8,16 December 2018,"This will be for many people a type of black and white film they have never experienced. Shot with all the modern digital tools but evoking the neo realists after WWII, this film is like a sheet of transparency held up to the sun: like a memory being intravenously shot into your cortex.
Cuaron has been very open in stating this is essentially an autobiographical snapshot of his childhood growing up in Colonial Roma, a neighbourhood in Mexico City but it is also a clear nod to Fellini's Roma and the other neo realists especially Bunuel. Though Curaon's memories, the film is about Cleo, played by Yalitza Aparicio,
the maid to the middle class family he grew up in.
The film thematically matches very well with 2018. No matter your colour, class, nationality - men are assholes and it is left up to the women to band together and weather life.
My issue was that Cleo seems underdeveloped for the main character of a film, passive both in the film and life, which I assume is a result of this being Cuaron's story in many ways and not hers. This is shown in the way Cuaron shoots - nary a closeup but wide frame, camera panning or sliding more typical of a documentary. This all keeps the viewer at a distance.
Cuaron has made a masterpiece but it is called Children of Men.",Roma

But this is one of those films that tries to impress you with how boring it is. Even my Mexican wife, who loves any film, actor, character, or TV show having to do with Mexico, was bored to tears by this.It's textbook pretentious filmmaking. Nothing to grip you. Nothing to keep you interested. No mystery. No wonder. No real characters. No real tension.It looks no better than a higher budget film school experiment.No one will remember this film in five years.

303,johntheholder,"Its a fairly complicated debate , why some will think this film is special and others will not.",7,14 December 2018,"In the world of ratings and marks I give this film a solid 7. Not more. Why?Because it's not a film I want to see again. As simple as that.To analyze a bit: The film does have great photography and as others have commented , it's in general great as far as technique. The strongest part of Roma is undoubtedly its -OCD level- of accuracy of 1970 Mexico city. There are little details that the director chose to include so as to pass as 1970 even for those sneaky observers who want to find a blunder, an error "" hey he missed that , or that car model wasn't made then etc.."" I don't think they'll find something not 1970 in it.Also I haven't seen a better earthquake captured in film making. That felt as legit as it gets. The riots where amazingly realistic as well. And so on and so forth..So yes I give this film 10/10 for its depiction of 1970 Mexico city and its level of reality. You are transported to 1970 Mexico city to put it simply. Which is an achievement. There were hard scenes to shoot. But a viewer doesn't care about such technicalities. A viewer wants a good film. Which is a subjective thing I know but still who'll say "" The Terminator "" or "" The Fisher king"" aren't great films? So there is a level of objectivity , things that should be there for us in a film to make it great.I want warmth , or entertainment or some kind of magic thing that makes a film work for me and makes me want to watch it every year or so. This film isn't one of those.After returning from the cinema I looked up the trivia and learned how Roma is a neighborhood in Mexico city ( I didn't even know that , I was asking myself why is it called Roma but who needs background info to enjoy a film?) and how it involves the memories of director Alfonso Cuaron from his childhood. This is very admirable and astonishing what he's done , it really is. But again , it doesn't mean I ll like the film because it's the director's childhood. A flawed film that comes to my mind is ""Boyhood"" , that does another thing altogether but I think that the reasons one person may like the one film are very similar to the reasons people liked Roma (Boyhood was shot in a span over the years as a kid really grew up , and Roma was shot of scenes really out of Cuaron's childhood being the loose comparison ) . I think that those who sincerely loved this film either hold on to the idea that its the director's childhood what they re seeing , so I guess it gets a plus because of it , or they are Mexicans who grew up in that era , or they are children of such people and know how real and true the scenes included are.But for a viewer who goes to watch Roma , with no prior knowledge whatsoever , a viewer who doesn't know why it's called Roma , or even such basics as who the director is, then I think such a person may indeed appreciate its realistic tones , its great detail and meticulous inputs on every scene , and even the great craftsmanship of the director ( whoever he may be). But the film isn't a grabber. It's not one that the clueless viewer will say "" wow this goes on my favorites films.While watching the film- midway through or later- when I knew that it doesn't do it for me that it's ok , I can watch it , its good and all but it doesn't have the magic for me, I tried to think of black&white films that did do the magic for me. Films like ""Paper Moon"" , ""Dolce Vita"" , Demy's ""Lola"" , or the great ""Rocco and his Brothers"" or even the one that should come to mind first , Pasolini's ""Mama Roma"" , and if I have to be mean ( and fair ) , Cuaron's Roma is inferior to those films not technique-wise , but as a film as a whole.
Not bad but not great for me.",Roma

The monochromatic palate of the film perfectly matched its tone. Not only were the visuals beautiful, but the story and characters were as well. The story is told through the eyes of a housemaid, Cleo, who with the family she cares for, goes through a great deal of pain and suffering that depicts the real social and biological pressures women deal with. This translates into a story that feels genuinely real. The emotions felt by the characters felt real. This realism reels you in as you get lost in the story.

306,AIOS-Reviews,A Direction like never before,9,24 February 2019,"Hardly twice or thrice in a year you watch a movie and can say movies are life. They don't know anything about movies who says movies are fake. Alfanso Cuaron's Roma is an art made in the perspective of an almost ignored unhappy life. This drama is deep and neat. Tales within tales made Roma a one of the best art of recent times.The story is about a mexican maid named Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio) works in a family with four children, their parents and grandma. She has a helpmate too. The film is about a year in the life of this maid. Set in 1970s this movie is edited black and white just to make you feel different or nostalgic or maybe to feel for them. I can't say the specific reason. Roma connect with your soul slowly. The moments like that guy singing in the burning forest, or at the end when Cleo went to save two children in the sea even she didn't know how to swim or that standing in one leg with the eyes closed make situations that you have to discover something about one specific life.10 academy award nominated this movie is about love, life and emotions. This is artistic, honest and beyond imagination which is to experience only. Alfanso Cuaron's superb direction made this more delightful to watch. This is even maybe one of the best film direction I've ever seen. Awesome cinematography is a resource of this film. There are no background score in this movie but the sound design is awesome.The special thing about Roma is one need experience of movies to watch it.

308,austinfromdahood,"Alfonso Cuaron' s best film, I hope it wins Best Picture",10,17 February 2019,"The oscars are coming up, and there were a lot of controversial nominations that were announced. Black Panther, A Star is Born, and Bohemian Rhapsody got nominated for a bunch of oscars, including Best Picture, and a lot of people (including me) were scratching our heads on why those movies got so much recognition. A lot of people think First Man got snubbed. I didn't watch the movie, but I can somewhat agree on it because of all the praise it got. I am pissed off about how Hereditary, one of favorite movies of 2018, didn't get a single nomination. Maybe because it's an artsy movie, and everyone knows how the oscars hate those. But I do agree with the academy on one thing, which is giving Roma a bunch of nominations, and that is the movie I will be reviewing today.Karsten Runquist said that Roma is his favorite movie of 2018, and of course I had to check it out. It was on Netflix, so I watched it one night, and I was blown away. There are too many great things about the movie. To be completely honest, I don't see a flaw in it at all.Alfonso Cuaron directed this movie, and he is a director known to immerse the viewer into the movie using his cinematography. That goes for all of his movies except Gravity, because that movie is stupid. This movie is immersive not just for the fantastic cinematography, but for the interesting story that is being presented as well. Every sound in the movie makes me feel like I'm there with the characters, and I can feel what the characters are feeling as well.The acting in this movie is so damn good. Yalitza Aparicio is the lead actress in this movie, and this is her first acting role ever. It blows my mind how good she does on her first role. She got nominated for Best Actress at the academy, and I really hope she wins. All the other actors in this movie also give great performances, and I hope these new actors will have a good career ahead of them.This film was shot in black and white, and it really gives a old school feel to the movie. Some shots are really contrasted and vibrant, and it gives a shiny look even though this movie is in black and white. The plot is like a rollercoaster. There are so many ups and downs, and it gave me a variety of emotions throughout the film. When the movie ended, I thought to myself, ""I wish it was longer."" When I want a movie to be longer than it is, I know that I like it very much. This movie is a masterpiece, no doubt about it, and I hope it wins Best Picture. 10/10",Roma

All the acting seemed genuine, like this was simply a documentary following these people around and I was definitely impressed by that. I understand the unbelievable praise this film is getting by fan and critic alike, but I can't help but think the beauty in the cinematography and the acting is making up for the simplified plot and predictable story.

I gave it a 7 basically because of it and because of the decent cast, but if it only depended on plot wise, it'd be a mere 6 or perhaps 5.It's obvious that Cuarón is a master when it comes to cinematography and capturing beautiful scenes in new, fresh ways that surprise us. His long, distance shots pay homage to the classic Italian movies - the scene where Fermín is practicing martial arts among a big group reminded me of La Dolce Vita and other Fellini movies, and that was breathtaking and beautiful to watch.I also think Cuarón wisely chose the black and white color to make the movie look less mundane and more spiritual, in order to enhance the content of the story. But, unfortunately, plot is not that amazing.I understand that the whole story is about Cleo and her struggles, but if it was supposed to be this way, I was expecting more focus on Cleo and on her internal turmoil. That's not what happens. Cuarón was so obsessed with showing a normal family life in 70s Mexico that he was too distant from Cleo to make us know her well. The character, yet good written in its subtlety, makes me wish I knew more about her, but unfortunately she barely speaks in the movie and there is little to none character development.

There is very little in the way of plot -- something that critics just love to characterize as atmospheric or free-form.Sadly, it's hard to care about any of the characters as the movie meanders along.But it is beautifully filmed.

It's not the easiest watch, it's a long film, slowly revealing what is happening within this family, and this young maid that finds herself in an unfortunate predicament.For this being Yalitza Aparicio's first time acting, I thought she did a phenomenal job. You really felt for her, what she was going through, and you see how just important she is to this family dynamic. From the mom to the grandma to each kid, they all have a unique personality of their own, and the character moments that Cuarón chooses to show is what really makes you connect with these characters - like how the youngest kid in the movie keeps trying to tell his family that he remembers this past life that he had.It is beautifully shot and since Cuarón grew up in Mexico City, he knew exactly the story and the look he wanted to tell.just like with most movies this year, it's not for everyone, critics will love it and anyone that appreciates a slow build in movies. just give this one a chance, let it wash over you and soak in all it has to offer.",Roma

337,isaacj02,"Perfectly designed, yet lacking in depth",8,19 January 2019,"Alfonso Cuaron has made a name for himself as a stellar director but his passion project, 2018's Roma, is an impressive feat even for this Oscar-winning heavyweight, who not only directs here, but writes, shoots and edits as well. Roma is an ode to Cuaron's childhood in Mexico City, told through the eyes of a young housekeeper, Cleo (newcomer Yalitza Aparicio), whose life we see unfold against the backdrop of political turbulence.
Roma is a definite exercise in artistry; this film is absolutely gorgeous, shot in vintage black and white (a pretentious yet oddly fitting decision), full of wide and detailed shots that immerse us within the world. As well as beauty, there's a phenomenal sense of authenticity to the film, whether it be in languid scenes that play out in real time or in the film's intricate sound design, which favours the ambience of street noises over a stringed orchestra.
The technical mastery of Roma, however, acts as both its greatest achievement and its pitfall. The film's design somewhat overshadows its plot, hiding a flawed picture beneath its glossy exterior. Much of this movie, in particular the middle, is rather mundane, struggling to reach the high emotional stakes one expects. The narrative rambles and there are numerous points where the film feels restrained by its luscious presentation. The factor that prevents Roma from becoming simply a parade of pretentiousness is the clearly deep personal reasons behind which it has been made; though the film is not always consistent, Alfonso Cuaron is an attentive director and his intelligent and gentle screenplay is one of the film's greatest strengths. In all truth, when Roma hits gold, it's a subtle, yet deeply moving film; scenes in the third act particularly are very well done, serving that desired emotional resonance that the rest of the film desperately fails to deliver.
Yalitza Aparicio gives a wonderfully natural performance as Cleo, but the real stand out performer of the film is Marina de Tavira as Sofia, the mother of the family. De Tavira produces the only performance that truly gripped me, never allowing herself to be overshadowed by the virtuous design of the film. Equally satisfying is Cuaron's clever inclusion of political context that provides for the most pleasing dramatic moments.
Roma is likely to find great success in the awards season this year; credit should be given to the sheer flair of the film's design and Cuaron's astute writing and cinematography. However, beneath the art of Roma lies a lesser film, that only sporadically hits its targets of emotion and excitement.",Roma
338,nikatnyte,"Gorgeous, poetic, breathtaking...but where's the story?",5,11 December 2018,"There's no question that Cuaron's brilliance as a film director is on full display in this amazing film--almost every take is flat-out gorgeous, and some are jaw-droppingly stunning. He uses symbolism masterfully: subtly, almost unobtrusively, yet effective in its intended impact. My complaint is an essential one: where's the story? We know almost nothing about the primary character, Cleo the nanny. We don't know anything of her family or her background, and practically nothing about her dreams, goals or aspirations. Yes, she's presented sympathetically, and we care about her to an extent, but she seems little changed through the course of the film, even after going through some challenging experiences. The upper-class family she works for also has their challenges, but nothing terribly unusual. Profound peripheral events (a forest fire, a street riot, a martial arts display) are riveting in their presentation, but they're only momentary digressions--they appear to have no lasting impact on the main characters. This was a beautiful film to watch (I wasn't bored in the slightest) yet when it was all over I wanted more than just memorable images.",Roma
339,demented_peruvian,"Some stunning scenes, but 60s art homage is a step backward for Latin American cinema",7,27 December 2018,"Alfonso Cuaron has been one of the most impressive visual directors of the past 20 years, in which there is a lot of detail going on in the background, so it's no surprise that he assembles some very stunningly done scenes in ""Roma"". Very mundane endless scenes suddenly become filled with much action in the background, with coordinated movements of extras that invoke the great epic cinema of past decades. There are probably 5 or 6 of these moments in ""Roma"", which make it applause-worthy. It gets bonus points from me for more realistically depicting Mexico, unlike the Mariachi, narcos, and 'fresa' spoiled drama queens typically seen in Mexican cinema and TV. It even shows non-white Mexicans and depicts more than one language. Unfortunately, there are many scenes that lead to very little or should have required much more editing, as Cuaron creates homages not only to his childhood, but also to Bergman, Fellini, Buñuel, and the New Wave, with great skill but mixed cinematic products. Well crafted haunting and satiric images are intertwined with never-ending images so dull that make you wonder why you are not staring outside your window instead of the screen.The screenplay is another issue. The story is far too underdeveloped to sustain interest. At it's best,""Roma"" touches on themes of women being abandoned by men to manage families on their own, the mixed relationships of a family with its servants, class divisions, and the dangers to which children were exposed more easily in another era. At it's worst, ""Roma"" mixes in every single cliche of Latin American art cinema, essentially: ""let's analyze Latin society by showing scenes in the life of a family through the eyes of the [maid/children]."" Maybe this was groundbreaking in the Spanish ""Veneno Para Hadas"", but for the longest time, it's been every other movie in Latin American cinema, which are mostly plotless, slow, dull affairs by misguided self-proclaimed disciples of Goddard. I'm thus disappointed, as Cuaron is part of the movement to make Latin cinema more dynamic and interesting. Given this movie's accolades, I fully expect more of this same sub-type dull Latin art cinema for the next decade.",Roma

The travails of Cleo and her employer could get mundane, but the cinematography (coupled with black and white) can remind one of a Kubrick or Fellini at times. Yalitza Aparicio is incredible, given that this is her first gig. The stillbirth scene is minimalist yet gut-wrenching. The attention to history is also fascinating, and led me to research more after the movie.There is some camp, as wrestler Latin Lover portrays a semi-mythical Mexican hero who trains the Halciones.You may have heard that the plot is dry, but this film is best enjoyed as the tremendous cinematic experience it is.

342,javomed88,A must-see on the big screen!,10,12 December 2018,"I watched 'Roma' at the cinema a few days before its Netflix release and it was the best idea ever! As a Mexican, I was naturally curious to watch the film everyone has been talking about. I have always admired Alfonso Cuaron's work, particularly films such as 'The Little Princess' and 'Y Tu Mama Tambien'. However, it wasn't until the 2010s when he consummated his career after the 'Children of Men' and 'Gravity'. It is evident that he has made an impact in recent years and I truly believe he is one of the most talented filmmakers today.'Roma' is powerful in the whole extent of the word. It is not only different and captivating, but also very artistic and honest. It is a filming exercise that reminds us that style, narrative and emotion can be best achieved when excelling traditional cinematic language. The simplicity of this film was captured beautifully with highly skilled cinematography, which Cuaron developed himself. Every frame was methodically crafted in the form of a black and white portrait that perfectly reflects the nostalgia of a 1970s Mexico.I am extremely amazed by Yalitza Aparicio, an Indigenous Mexican young actress, taking the lead in this film. Her performance is of such greatness that she carries the whole film by herself in an exceptional manner. She is absolutely natural, brave and unique. I do believe that she deserves an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress and hope she gets it.The reason why this film has to be seen on the big screen is to fully appreciate the extent of Cuaron's cinematographic work. Moreover, sound mixing, production design and editing are also best experienced in cinemas. Obviously, this film needs to be rewatched on Netflix at home.Without exaggerating, I believe this film will make history. I do not think Cuaron implements any new techniques or breaks any schemes. Nevertheless, he brings back the organic cinematic expression and therefore, 'Roma' will be remembered for long. 'Roma' is undoubtedly one of the best films of the year. It's the intimate work of an extraordinary filmmaker, and it's worth recognising this masterpiece as a genuine example of 'the seventh art'.Score: 10/10FJ Medina",Roma
343,kingslandbungalow,Ultimately disappointing.,1,31 January 2019,"Right out of the gate Roma is an ""artistic"" movie - the overly long opening shot of water on paving stones (with airplanes reflected in the puddles) goes on waaaay too long. This set the tone for the whole movie.
It was shot in black and white (oversaturated) to be artsy, not because it added anything to the story. There were many added elements that were there as a self-indulgent artistic touch, but they fail to make up for NO plot and only marginal character development.
A movie should tell a story, this one doesn't . I can see why people would like it, especially people who think of themselves as deep. But in the absence of a plot then we need STRONG characters - once again it's a miss. The main actress literally has the same stunned look on her face from start to finish, it's obvious she has no experience. The supporting actors are a little better but not by much.
I had such high expectations and was extremely disappointed, give it a miss.",Roma
344,mshackletonchavez,Perhaps The Years Best Film.,10,21 December 2018,"Was I ready for this masterpiece, I think not. Quite possibly the film of the year, Alfonso Cuarón has crafted a beautiful, heartbreaking and gorgeously vivid film.This film has multiple strengths, first I must comment that Yalitza Aparicio as Cleo was absolutely stunning. I cannot believe that this is her first acting experience, her performance was visceral, layered, complicated and a class act. Truly an emotional role, and one I will not forget easily. The rest of the cast is also of the upmost quality, everyone has brought their 'A' game to this table. In particular I thought the mother, portrayed by Marina de Tavira was excellent. As well as the rest of the supporting cast, the children who never felt forced nor silly, the grandmother who was cold for most of the film but came rivetingly alive in moments of great tension and emotional weight.This film's narrative was truly incredible. The final half an hour is possibly the most impactful, masterful and cinematically incredible of any film I have seen this year. The whole third act from when the riots start, to the the end, is truly a masterpiece. It made me cry a great deal, which is exceedingly rare for a film to evoke that much emotion from me. Everything just added up, the depth of characterisation in the first two acts just gave the strongest release, of pain and eventually happiness and love. It was truly the work of a director in his prime, in his most effective. Certain words were inflected to deliver even more depth, (I can speak Spanish) and it just added more character, the names had extra suffixes, and more could be conveyed. This made what was shown, even more emotional, truly incredible use of language, something that couldn't have been achieved if it were in English.There was moments, even entire sections of this film where it transcended everything. Beyond language, beyond the frame, beyond its colours, beyond race, beyond its depth and emotion, beyond the narrative itself, it became something so pure, so encompassing, so real. It became something else, something words cannot describe. It is the purest and most beautiful form of cinema. This film is why movies exist, it is the benchmark upon all else should be compared.Alfonso Cuarón has given us a masterpiece, that we should all be thankful to be in the same world as. His direction, is simply beyond anything I have seen this year. It feels incredibly personal, his vision is pure and goes beyond simply a great film, this is pure humanity. he has written, directed, produced, edited and was the cinematographer for this film. In all those departments, he is a master. His work with the camera is like a legend's final cry, yet he is not an aged man, its like a lifetimes work crashing in two hours, its exquisite. The slow pans across all landscapes gives a detached, and yet so intrusive feeling. As if the camera is just watching these people, similar to Manchester By The Sea, but better here. The decision to grade this film into black and white, helps it to engross its audience, it truly is of aid to this film. In addition to delivering a timeless feel, one is not distracted by colour or if it looks real, it just is. Its so pure, it immerses the viewer more deeply.The editing is masterful, perhaps the years best, the tone is sustained, heightened and is some of the strongest work in this I have possibly ever seen. His screenplay, as I have said before, is just incredible. One just has to see it, my words do it little justice. Cuarón direction is so strong, his mastery of performances helps to carry this film into its astonishing heights. His control, this vision is untainted, unrestrained, an achievement to behold, to wait for, something that only comes in fleeting years. One that will go down in history.The film feels timeless, the setting is the 1970's, but it does not feel aged, or like its highlighting that. The set design and costume design are worthy of the upmost honours and awards, they set the atmosphere, give depth and love, and give coldness and fear too. They work so well subliminally, it feels real, tangible, like one could touch it. It gives no distraction, nor does it call for attention, it all compliments the rest of the feature perfectly.Although, I must state that I felt that in one place the film lost a bit of its pace. Many scenes play out very slowly to maximum effect, which I dare not specifically mention as to not spoil them. But some others feel a little too drawn out, particularly in the middle of the second act. And that's it, my only complaint about the filmmaking. Also, while this is no fault of the film, on Netflix the english subtitle's were not always perfect, they sometimes dodged the meaning of certain scenes a little, but luckily I understanding the language had no problem. Just, for people who don't speak Spanish, beware of slight mistranslations, but of course, this is no problem with the film as a film, only the service used.In the end, my complaint is that not enough people are seeing this motion picture. This is just the near perfect film, noting else this year comes close to its emotion, its masterful characteriation and consistent strength of performances. The sum of its part is a future classic, a film by which this decade may be defined by, in its art, its love, its overwhelming emotion, its perfect cinematography, its masterful score, its beautiful direction, its wondrous performances, and finally its perfect narrative and screenplay.It has taken me two days to write this review, much debate to wether a 9 or 10 is deserved. For I reserve a 10 for films that truly go beyond, not just in filmmaking but emotion, and how it personally impacts me. I am incredibly restrained in my ratings, and do not give out high numbers with ease, but here... here I feel it just about makes it. This film is near perfect, and it may just by the film of year, and the decade. 10/10",Roma
345,schell-7,A Loving Tribute to Cinema's Most Some of Cinema's Past,9,1 April 2019,"The story is set in the turbulent early '70s, a time of social change,student protests, Woodstock, Watergate, ""Deep Throat,"" Viet Nam, and Plato's Retreat. At one extreme were the selfishness and sexual experimentation of a pre-HIV, pre-Apple computer group of self-indulgent flower children and child-adults who appropriated the term ""swinger"" from popular music and jazz and applied it to ""free love"" in the Age of Aquarius. At the other extreme were those who suffered from the worship of youth and the thoughtless behavior of self-possessed males whose fixation on penis size stymied growth in self-understanding and empathy.Yet at such times cinema can serve as a ""criticism of life,"" helping expose the root causes of social unrest and spiritual stagnation. At the time depicted by ""Roma,"" many thoughtful, serious types were looking to the redemptive visions in the work of socially-conscious film ""artists"" such as Fellini and Bergman, André Bazin, Jean Renoir and Robert Bresson while European directors also looked to Hollywood directors like Wyler and cinematrapher Toland for the best techniques to ""show the world as it is,"" as opposed to some fantastical escapist version of reality.""Roma"" is a love-letter to such visionary film artists of the past as well as to the public that revered their films. Even before any story is under way, director Caron allows us to see for ourselves the characters at work and play, along with the outer circumstances that influence and reveal the characters inner selves and relationship with others. Rather than a cinematic ""construct"" that makes the film editor the most important producer and manipulator of what we see and feel, the first hour of the film ""preserves"" the continuity of space and time with carefully composed, steady and stately, camera work and deep focus that are antithetical to the intentionally shaky cameras and shock editing of modern filmmakers intent on exciting spectators and pleasing the sponsors who can fund their next project.The film loses its interest when it goes for some dramatic, even sensational, conflicts--the scene of a Dionysian party with the unfaithful husband, then of a widespread destructive fire, and shortly afterwards a violent demonstration that goes from the streets into a store, where the pregnant servant-maid and main character (Cleo), meets up with her faithless lover, who stays by her long enough to demonstrate his phallic power and pride but leaves when he impregnates her.Cleo is neither beautiful nor strong, but she's an ""over-achiever,"" whose empathy and creativity provoke her to ""play dead"" for the benefit of the children she's responsible for protecting and minding. And in the film's climax, she ignores her inability to swim and takes on the turbulent life-like ocean and its potentially lethal undertow by going into the waves--as deep and far as she's able--after giving birth to her own still-born child--to save the two children who have disobeyed their birth mother by not staying close to shore.It's an act that binds this little community--a grandmother, a mother of 3 children, and a heroic dark-skinned Mexican nanny--we feel their emotion and loving trust and, thanks to the composition of the shot, the strength of a new family bond. The director's composition shows the group on the beach and in the formation of a triangle, the most rigid, or strong, of all shapes (as geometrists and architect-housebuilders know well).The film uses moving objects--oversized American cars (Ford Galaxies)--to provoke the viewer to find life and meaning object soon seen as symbols--the car denoting excess, carelessness, male vanity and a sense of power. The film eschews a music score but compensates with images and sounds we trust far more than the contrived excitement of shaky cameras, jump cuts, and special effects. This is the kind of movie Bazin glimpsed in the work of Wyler and Welles, both indebted to the deep focus lens of cinematographer Greg Toland. The attention to a servant girl devoid of resources is close to the subtle characterization of Robert Bresson in ""Mouchette. And the focus on details exposing the dynamics of a family evokes Ozu's masterful ""Tokyo Story.""There's an important difference. The ending not only promises a loving household but allows the viewer to make sense of Cleo's ascent to the roof of the building via an outdoor ladder, or fire escape. There's a hint of danger as we look up at the mass of steel--a structure we see as more in line with Cleo's abilities to climb than anyone else's. And as Cleo disappears, leaving us with the structure and the sky, the sense of danger is mitigated by the hope we have in Cleo's ability to use a fire-escape not for its nominal purpose but to come closer to her dreams. Welles definied film as a ""ribbon of dreams,"" Fof Cleo that definition is contradicted by her experinece with boyfriend Fermin (a phonetic twin of ""Vermin"") in a movie theater. But it might be applied to the fire-escape--or to the viewer's experience of seeing Cleo through the lens of a camera we have learned to trust like that of the film auteurs of the last century.",Roma
346,floraposteschild,"A very, very positive review! But...",8,18 December 2018,"What most people are saying is true -- this a heart-felt film, with gorgeous visuals (I honestly don't know how Cuaron got some of those long takes), innovative sound, top performances, drama, action, suspense and much more. Yes, the first hour is slow, but it pays off in the end, I swear. Ninety-five percent of people who like foreign language films at all will love it. BUT it is an Alfonso Cuaron film, which means it's sometimes on the sentimental side. If you've ever seen a film about a downtrodden maid, you could probably write the outline of this story yourself, including the climax, which is extremely well done, but also predictable. When the trip to the beach was discussed, I thought ""is he going to do that?"" And yes, he does. I think Cuaron intended some ironic commentary on that type of ending, but it's up to you to decide. There are also some significant plot threads left hanging, for example what happened to the mother who lost her land? Maybe it was cut out of the final film for time reasons, but I suspect more to preserve a fairly happy ending and keep the focus on the European family. Maybe that's a failure of courage, or art. I don't know. Regardless, this is a film worth seeing, and more than once, on the biggest screen you can find.",Roma

He has made some pretty brilliant films full of insightfulness ... and also some pretty obnoxious films full of pretentiousness.What's the plot of Roma? Who cares - Alfonso Cuaron doesn't. It's just an excuse to design self-indulgent static slow-pans back and forth from some oscillating robotic omniscient point of view where people walk in and out of frame in either mundanity or hysterics. There's no intimacy with any of the characters psychology or what motivates their aims or aspirations. This is a piece completely detached from committing to an emotional point-of-view, and totally devoid of any moral conviction. Some see that as brave, but ""some"" are just spineless. It just sits - shinning in it's placid flaccid uselessness, as neither enlightening commentary or entertaining commerse. And that's not just a shame - it's a sin.Oh it's set in 1970's Mexico during some redundantly superfluous backdrop of political unrest. There's a young indigenous woman who is employed as house servant to a bourgeoisie couple - whose marriage is falling apart in front of their hoard of nondescript children with no particular autonomous volition to discern outside their proclivity to appear confused and cry. The husband is the kind of guy that values his car above his family. The maid has some turmoil over a pregnancy from a fair weather absentee father who supplements a devotion to cultish martial arts buffoonery instead of taking any semblance of moral responsibility. Prerequisite bar scene, hospital scene, and moving out scenes follow. Well, rough sketches of those type of scenes at least, as the camera never shows much compassion or interest. We climax with kids in supposed oceanic peril, and a group hug on the beach. Anyway, that's kinda the plot. there is no point. No music score. Some superficially nice enough camera compositions from Cuaron doing the cinematography himself - although none of the shots serve any particular storytelling purpose per say - in fact they're more of a disservice - save for possibly the genuinely captivating opener.This movie appears to have an R-Rating for the sole reason that Alfonso Cuaron wanted to have what must have been a 3 minute unbroken scene entirely shot wide in a brightly lit master within a motel/apartment, from where our protagonists maid (snuggled in bed sheets) observes her bare young hong-kong-phooey lover using a shower curtain rod to perform some absurd bo staff martial-art peacocking with his dingle dangling. Apparently it is vital we hold witness to this entire uncut (wink) display with full reference of the man's flapping phallus and the smooth hairless limbs and torso branching thereout, because obscuring the supple post-pubescent nubility of an ill-nuanced male youth by shadow, cropped framming, and/or underwear wouldn't be nearly ""artistic"" enough. Instead of this scene entrancing by the verisimilitude of his vérité, it rather distracts the mind to wonder of Mr. Cuaron's clandestine proclivities and motivations. There's no one to invest in or relate to in the film. But it must be a masterpiece, because it's in black and white and has untrained actors fluctuate between staring blankly and periodically putting their head in their hands in front of a dispassionate lens for long stretches where nothing happens.I'll give it 5/10 just because its opening shot reflecting a distant plane flying between building walls inside the swishing foyer floor mob water was a pretty clever establisher.A fruitless exercise in uninvested tedium.

Much like my mind, my phone was buzzing, Dana, my best and closest friend on this planet had text me a sobering proposition: ""Wanna go see Roma tonight?""I hadn't heard about Roma, I had zero idea what it was about, I just knew it was Alfonso Cuaron's newest film. But even if I had read a synopsis, I don't think it would have prepared me for the emotional toll this film took on me. I've sat with it for two days now and my feelings for it seem to get stronger.At first glance Roma's story hits you with the French New Wave vibe, oh we're going to be watching these people live, no real plot, etc. But as the film goes on I realized the ""slice of life,"" style the film presents itself as was actually much more involved and stimulating. A seemingly simple story becomes complicated, heart wrenching and captivating.
I really don't want to talk about the plot, you should just experience it. But be warned, it gets heavy and at times bleak and dark. But such is life, and Roma is teeming to the brim with it. And for as much heartache and pain the characters experience, there is also a contrasting beauty, an overwhelming sense of wonder blended with the natural hilarity of life. Roma wonderfully captures the peaks and valleys of about a year's time and compacts it into a 2 hour chunk, we're just along for the ride. The story and characters are handled with a deeply personal level of care and acute detail.Technically Roma, is astounding, and is composed with some of the most beautiful camera work I've ever seen. Many sequences left me wondering how Cuaron, who shot this himself, was able to choreograph and orchestrate such complex and breathtaking shots? I don't really have an eye for cinematography, but this film is so gorgeous and well composed it really stands as a marvel.Roma is such a complete taste of life, such a strong, confident film. It's story pulls you in close, and is unflinching it is depiction of loss and fear and love and joy.

What is happening? Why? You can guess a lot even if you don't know anything, which was my case before some research (and props to Cuaron on that) but it feels lacking in that regard.
There are marks of true cinematic genius: the car that is too big for a driveway full of dog waste; (had to change as per IMDB rules), the killing in the furniture store, the training of the ""elite squad"", the ice cream scene where Cleo is left standing, to name just a few (besides the ""Marooned"" reference on Cuaron's ""Gravity"").

It's like watching a bizarre hidden camera show (a-la Truman show) of Cleo's life, making for discomfort in the scenes. Even the camera inside the house mirrors the movements of a CCTV camera; panning right to left or vice-versa in a fixed position. My first introduction to Cuaron (other than Gravity, I was just a blissfully unaware child at that time) was Children of Men, one of my favourite films of all time. But, the theme I noticed after Roma, my third Cuaron film, is the surprising absence of happiness. This film will not make you happy. It is a depressing tale of a native Mexican house-worker in a wealthy family. I would have to rank it second in Cuaron's filmography that I have seen in terms of depressingness, not dethroning Children of Men, but leaving you far more empty inside when compared to Gravity. Also, in terms of quality. The film-making: Superb. The cinematography: Superb. The visual storytelling: Fantastic. My only gripe would be the first half-an-hour or so, being a bit of a drag. But having seen it through to the end, it all makes sense. The life of Cleo is monotonous, therefore the film follows suit.
In conclusion, watch this film if you have Netflix. If anything, it shows how the theatrical release of films is dying. Long live the streaming king.",Roma

I even remember when i could see movies with better quality on VHS, so it makes me very sad that a movie in 2018 could get this good reviews without having any good story, characters, picture quality, or even the realism which was spoken highly of. This movie had slow scenes with so many completely worthless scenes (""trying"" to be artistic). The sound and picture in the movie was incredibly dull, boring and sad, only giving you sad vibes eventhough you was looking at a family eating food happily. Probably the only reason easily influenced morons liked it.Why would seeing less color be more artistic? I believe i can come up with more than 1 million reasons why it's not and why only morons thinks art is best presented as simple as possible for example a plain circle with no colors, come to be a painting worth 800 000$.But i don't feel inclined to be a teacher of adults on IMDB. If you manage to see art in something just because it has less effects and less colour to it, that's because you're not able to use your brain very well. You can see the same things and more if you're at least somewhat creative. What you see as art, the director see as saving money and producing cheap crap for idiots to call art and beautiful.",Roma

And yet the movie left me cold.Visual movies like ""The Tree Of Life"" and ""Baraka"" move me to tears every time I see them. I think what I missed in Roma was a gripping score and a story arc. I felt like I was watching a documentary without a purpose. And while much of the black and white cinematography was beautiful, I think HDR color could have made the movie look stunning.

373,Fenrir_Sleeps,"Synecdoche, Mexico City",3,19 January 2019,"Not so many years ago, a not so underground movie called ""Synecdoche, New York"" warned about the dangers of making art by recreating one's own life on a grand scale.Given that Alfonso Cuarón's newest film basically is just that - a bigger-than-life recreation of his upbringing in Mexico City - ""Roma"" should be, at least, a funny experience. Oh, I'd have bet that, after Charlie Kaufman's warning some years ago, I would have some good laughs over a bloated autobiographical film from a megalomaniac director. But no...""Roma"" couldn't even please me that way. It's just another sanitized production from a master craftsman, but poor storyteller. Afraid of provoking the audience in any sense, ""Roma"" doesn't fail because it doesn't even try to do something. And if it doesn't fail, it can't also be funny...just plain boring.""Roma"" is straight and sleek as the shaft of a broom: every nook and splinter, every aspect that could possibly startle the audience over what they are seeing was readily polished out of existence. The film is completely built out of memory, yet still, as you watch it, you cannot shake off the feeling that ""Roma"" is as hollow as an eggshell: historical recreations and social classes' conundrums are thrown in without any sort of explanation. What is going on beyond the soap opera plot? What's the cause for all the rioting in the streets? What's behind the tensions between landowners and workers at the hacienda?Cuarón decides to race past all the important questions in ""Roma"", consequently turning it into little more than a condensed Mexican telenovela. Touching politics or social dilemmas in the movie would mean raising some hairs in the necks of some part of the audience and, therefore, lesser chances to collect some golden statues at the next Academy Awards ceremony, probably.As big a treat for the eyes (and ears) as ""Roma"" might be, as brilliant Yalitza Aparicio's performance as the main character is, the story behind ""Roma"" is not better than your average Oscar-nominee Hollywood melodrama. Even though Cuarón seems to be back on Earth half a decade after releasing ""Gravity"", ""Roma"" still feels as airless and inane as the outer space.",Roma

It is so stunning and provok the feeling about past. Even the shots of dog poop looks so gorgeous. LolOverally love this. Story may feel simple but it is so captivating, script and performances really fuels it.

The fact that the film was shot in black and white makes it seem like a boring film. It's actually a really boring movie. It's a very stable movie, not a lot of events. Cuaron influenced the critics with the overriding technical aspect of the film, and the audience with the overriding social aspect. Since Emmanuel Lubezki was not there, he directed the film himself, which allowed us to watch a complete Cuaron film. He deserves praise. I think it's a movie that will be remembered for many years.

379,rajarpitara,True cinema from a master of it.,10,30 August 2020,"Jean-Luc Godard once said that an image is truth, and cinema is truth 24 times a second. Alfonso Cuaron has made a film that cannot be more truthful.It's not a regular film which uses a plot to progress. This semi-autobiographical work of Cuaron comes out straight from his life in Mexico in 70s. The film follows an year of Cleo, a maid in a rich Mexican family, and shows various events and their effects on her.The very first shot of the film, showing a plane's reflection on the washed tiles, reveals how much of thought has gone into this.The cinematography is spectacular with long and elaborate takes. Fewer cuts invoke a feeling of real time and simultaneously make viewers to find pleasure in small details. The camera always pans slowly and gently as it tracks the Mexico of 70s - recreated masterfully by the production design. This gentleness can be observed in Cleo's demeanour throughout the film.Something which strikes about the camera work is that it keeps us at a distance from the characters by minimising the close ups. This complements the use of wide angles to add more visual details about the things around and their subsequent effects.Roma is a film of astounding beauty and subtle intimacy. This is one such film where visuals say a lot more than dialogues, and thus, it demands many careful viewings to truly decipher its magic.",Roma

I was transported to Mexico City and lived, for 135 minutes in Cleo's world and the world of her middle class employers lives. They engaged me, they made me laugh with them and cry with them in both joy, despair and relief.

386,thierryserra-05310,"Fabulous Documentarry, awful film",5,4 March 2019,"As a documentary about Mexican families in the 70's it's great. As a film, though, it's terrible.
The Good:
I wasn't sure about a 2+ hours long B&W film, which are usually an eccentricity of independent film makers. But in this case, it helps to set the mood and the ambiance of the documentary.
Background, clothes and all the props are greatly selected and captured, and it did remind me of my childhood.
Photography is amazing and it's a beautiful film.
The Bad:
Like I said, i believe Roma is a documentary that depicts real life events and characters of the era. But it has No story, No main Characters and No plot. That's why I consider the film to be a documentary.
It's not the story of the maid, no the story of the family not the story of anything. it's random events that could happen to people in the 70's depending on social status. But there is no storyline.
The maid's performance is acceptable. There has been a great fuss about it because she is a pre-hispanic actress. One of the first. So what's the big deal? It may be the same fuss about the first african actor or woman director. The first always makes waves. And we know the Oscars are pure politics, but her performance is not worthy of an Oscar. Not even close.
Also nominated was ""the Mother"". I'm shocked. Her performance isn't bad... it's awful. Every time she's on screen you wish she wasn't. The only actors worse than her are the four children. Where did Cuarón find so bad actors?
The secondary characters are no better and when one of them is hurt or almost dies, you are relieved you might not have to endure their pitiful performances anymore. So, as a film, it's worth a 1. Maybe a 2 for photography.
The Ugly:
You are warned at the beginning of brief nudity. Turns out a whole scene is the maid's boyfriend jumping around like a fool completely naked. the scene makes no sense, is completely pointless and could have been erased all together. It brings nothing to the movie and brakes the PG13 rating of the rest of the movie. I believe that scenes like that are made to incraese their rating and make people think the movie is tougher then it really is or to create a ""Shoking"" effect that critics like so much. Absolute nonsense.Ina nut shell: If you want to see how people lives in Mexico in 1971 and the events that took place, you'll enjoy the film. If you're expecting a story, don't watch it.",Roma
387,walentys,"A hyper-realistic, honest account of real life, just not an interesting one",2,30 June 2019,"The only thing this film undeniably does well is realism. It absolutely feels like a perfectly realistic chapter out of a woman's life, just not an interesting one.Roma utterly lacks narrative. There was no attempt whatsoever to toy with a unique, fresh, or otherwise different take on a narrative structure, like countless films have done. Cuarón simply didn't want to have one at all. Oddly enough, this in itself does count as an artistic decision, just not an interesting one. Sure, there are no ""gimmicks"" that it relies on to tell its narrative, but there is also no narrative at all. It's just pure, honest, raw reality. Note that just because it has no narrative does not mean it does not have a story; there is a story, but without a backing narrative it's not interesting enough to be worthy of discussing.The black & white decision was a bit odd considering this film takes place in the '70s rather than the eras more commonly associated with a ""black & white look"", such as the '40s. But the decision was likely made to fit with the theme of being a mundane, drab slice of life. Indeed even the lighting and shading employed was intentionally bland and low-contrast. While it fits the theme, once again it does not make for interesting nor appealing visuals.In many ways this film did resemble ""Y Tu Mamá También"", especially with its trademark Alfonso Cuarón long continuous panning shots. However, the chief difference is that film had actual substance: it had plenty of comedy, drama, and human concepts to ponder over after the credits rolled, such as the female vs. male perspective on life.The only thing to ponder after these credits roll is, ""Why was this made?""",Roma

I'm not quite sure why, though, there are so many out there already... mine is not going to make a difference, but still I feel like writing... something. So, here it goes:The hype surrounding this film is not wrong, it is an exquisite film, in most (cinematic) regards. And still, I did feel that the hype has more to do with the fact that such a beautifully made film is struggling to find screens in the theaters of its own Director's-Editor's-Cinematographer's-Screenwriter's-Producer's country of origin. Don't get me wrong, I'm up for THAT hype as well, but the fact that I listed Cuaron's tasks in this film in a long-hyphened-one-liner is no coincidence. It is a statement on over-indulgence that kind of wants whoever reads this to consider that, maybe... just maybe... he should've entrusted some of these departments to someone else (ehm, screenwriting and/or editing), and the film might have just connected with me. I was constantly trying to find empathy with the characters. And I got very close, but sadly, by the end, I simply didn't. I was so astonished by how perfectly shot the film was, that it didn't really feel like a beautiful film, but rather, a beautifully made film. It's not the same. The first one refers to the story, while the second refers to the craft of making the film. It still got as close as it gets to being overwhelming, though. I think I'm even a little sad that it didn't. Not that Cuarón or anyone else cares.Anyway, watch it, in the theater, or at home, it doesn't matter.

It has absolutely no qualities to justify any acclaim. Does it have any positive points? Yes, it is beautifully shot, but nothing groundbreaking or to be studied in years to come. The plot starts at nowhere and goes nowhere. That simple. You can't even call it a character study because the characters are presented in a shallow and generic way, they too start at nowhere and go to nowhere. The acting is just average, definitely not worthy of all the nominations. The main character will never really let you know if she's happy, sad, desperate, in love, in fear...

Seriously, don't make the same mistake lots of us did. Do not waste your time on this one.",Roma

406,mattmayakeller,Clean up after the dog if you want your marriage to last,3,25 July 2020,"As soon as I noticed this movie was black white and they had a 5 minute scene watching the soap go down the drain, I should have ended it right there. However, it was a mailed DVD so it was more of commitment than streaming so I gave it a go.There are some good things about this movie. I think it was a pretty good depiction of middle upper class city life in Latin America. I am married to a Peruvian and many things were very accurate about the lifestyle, and the house. I also like the nostalgia component since I was a kid in the 70s and even though this movie took place in another country, there were still many familiar enjoyable details. I also found the affection of the family endearing. I also like that they didn't kill any of the major characters, just to torture the audience, which these kinds of artsy movies tend to do. I was waiting for tragedy but it never happened fortunately.The bad thing about this movie is that it lacked any kind of real story or plot, and that it was often super tedious. I don't think claiming that this makes this movie like real life and therefore realistic is a good excuse. I think it's just plain lazy. I have real life already. I watch movies because I want an entertaining story or because I want to experience something new, or learn something. I suppose I did learn some things and have some new experiences with this movie, but watching soap go down the drain or watching a maid take every corner around the house is hardly anything new. It seems like the director is more in love with his camera work than actually caring much about the audience's experience. Can I label camera work pretentious?I feel that somehow this movie was a montage of subtle and not so subtle social statements. Maybe that is the real purpose of this movie. So I am going to list some of what I perceived, with a little sarcasm mixed in1) Clean up after the dog if you want your marriage to last. Well the only thing I remember the husband saying the entire movie was something about there being dog poop all over the place, and there were many shots of the dog poop in the driveway. I think he left because of the poop maybe?2) You can't trust people that do karate naked. Unfortunately, the one scene in the movie that I will probably not forget. Yuck. What is the point really?3) Men are bad. Every adult male in this movie aside from maybe the chauffer, who really didn't have a single line, were astoundingly cold uncaring people. One of the wife's most dramatic lines was something about a woman always being alone. The karate guy boyfriend was also awful.4) Never leave you maid who can't swim to watch the kids at the beach in pounding surf. Duhhh5) The life of a poor maid in Mexico is not all that glamorous. Maybe this is the big reveal. Ha haOverall a very forgettable movie aside from the ""karate"" scene.",Roma

It has amazing cinematography, the fact that its in black and white adds a lot to the tone and mood; It also had great sound design and the scenary in it was great. It was long, but it felt appropriate, even leaving me wishing it was longer. It's a sad story with no real ending but that's part of its greatness. The acting was very good, the child actors weren't bad at all, and Yalitza's preformance was outstanding, considering she wasn't a proffesional actress before this role.

The directing was undoubtedly superb: shocking and delicate scenes were dealt with tastefully and artistically.

It's meant to portray real life and it does a great job of it, by far Cuaron's best work. He's definitely learned how to end a film since Children of Men (2006). At some points it is a little slow, but it makes up for it with the visuals and long shots in the most stunning parts of Mexico. Don't listen to the people giving it a 1/10, they write that review with hate, it's not from a place of sense.

432,raphaellecat,a dazzling achievement in filmmaking,10,29 March 2019,"What sets Roma apart from Alfonso Cuarón's impeccable library of films is how flawlessly he's mastered his visual craft into telling his most personal story to date.His career has sailed high and mighty as one of 21st century's most enthralling visual storyteller, giving us defining and revolutionary films such as Children of Men (personal favourite) and Gravity. This time, Alfoson Cuarón grounds himself in a different reality, with a story that embellishes in his signature visual dazzle, rendering an emotional truth to a subject matter that can only feel but personally attached to the filmmaker himself.Spanning one year, from 1970 to 1971, Roma tells the story of a live-in maid working for a middle-class family in Mexico City. From the very beginning, Alfonso pulls you in, immersing the viewer into a real intimacy with the family that will last till the end credits. Through emotional highs and lows, the narrative takes on different directions as it sweeps, tracks and pans to give visually engrossing sequences and moments that will imprint in your memory.Roma couldn't have been told if not for a wonderful cast of actors led by the magnificent Yalitza Aparicio, who gives the story its core and melts it with a beautifully heartfelt ending.

One can say that this is what low class people are expected to suffer and points to the unconscious warning that should motivate everyone to pull themselves upward into a higher level class. However, this movie only points out that regardless of class, the same despondency exists for ANY person when it comes to not being able to count on one's intimate partner to lovingly share and develop their relationship without imposing sudden abandonment and a carefree attitude about the repercussions of such abandonment, Such abandonment does not belong to a particular class and cannot be assigned to just the ""low class"". Sofi has several young children to continue to raise as a divorcee plus a new job, not to mention the crushing feeling of being cast aside by her husband. This relationship is far more developed and complex than the simple ""one night stand"" that Cleo experienced, yet both were victims of the same human despicableness. After the revelation of Sofi's abandonment, we are reminded that even her ""higher class"" status did nothing to protect her and her family. Even the government, as in the Mexican government's overreaching student demonstrators by killing them, shows the institutional abandonment of basic respect for human rights in countries not known for a totalitarian or dictatorial government. It seems ALL governments, North Korean, China, Russia, as well as the United States, Mexico, Chile have been known to kill innocent people. There is really no guarantee of certain favorable behavioral expectations of various class societies nor of the various governmental institutions when it comes to episodic human frailty interjecting its suffering onto people.

However, I just did not like this movie, as much as I tried to like it. It reminded me of one of a number of films in the 1970s that attempted to show ""real life"" and present it as a groundbreaking feat of filmaking.While the stark black and white photography was vivid and sharp, there was absolutely no connection established between the viewer and the film's characters.The only time there was any sense of drama at all came more than halfway into the film, which involved a riot and the main character's subsequent miscarriage. Even then, both events having been broadly hinted, the viewer does not feel a sense of drama.Even the ""rescue from drowning"" of the two youngest children, so prominently projected it bleeds any sense of drama or suspense out of the situation, falls flat as the woman simply strides into the surf, takes their hands and walks the children out of the waves.I actually stopped watching halfway through the film the first time I sat down to see it. My second viewing was hardly more positive, but I managed to plod through it.It is one thing to watch a film based upon the suggestion of an aquaintence, but another thing altogether when a film is universally praised and exaulted to the status of an instant classic. It is as if everyone jumped on the band wagon and nobody dared question the film's quality. Really not worth the attention it is getting and the praise it is receiving.",Roma
443,utah_cos,"I for once would cancel the whole Oscar ceremony, just award the prize to Roma, and not waste anyone's time",10,18 February 2019,"Such a brilliant, brilliant, rich movie. There are times in life when you feel you just lost a few hours. There are also times when you were productive at something and feel good, or times when you were simply entertained and feel good as well. There are also times when you feel so emotionally charged that you just have to stop thinking for a second, take a deep breath and start to dissect and to make sense of the last hours spent. This is how I felt after I saw Roma. I feel I do not have time and energy to unpack the layers and layers of meanings and messages transmitted by the movie.Let me start by saying the directing was amazing. The image was amazing (and i do not like black and white movies). The screenplay was amazing. The movie shows the life of a maid and through it goes into questions of class, race, family, gender roles, death. I will not detail where all these things appear but just stop at two things I found particularly impressive. Although it was easy for the movie to fall into the more known narrative of the maid being working class, different race, badly treated and thus unprivileged and discriminated, it does much much more than this. The maid is actually well treated, to the extent that it becomes a second mother (or father?) for the children. When the dad is gone, she becomes even more part of the family. In the ocean scene she does arguably what only parents would do, sacrificing her own life. Therefore, we are left wondering if are parents truly the backbone of a family? Must you have blood relations to be called a parent or to have more rights to raise a child? What does 'your' child mean anyway? If you gave birth to it, what rights are you entitled to? Is the servant/maid worse or better parent than the father who is always away, and cheats on his wife?Another striking thing is the constant presence of death in the movie. One of the children tells about someone who got shot at the beginning of the movie, then another child plays death, the maid says that she likes to be dead when she plays, her child is born dead, in that protest a lot of people are dying. I was ABSOLUTELY SURE that given all these clues, the children will also drown in the ocean scene! But the director brilliantly does not allow this. He twists in a way the whole narrative, to offer us also hope and happiness, that go hand in hand with death anyway. Because Roma is in the end a movie about life, more than it is about death.",Roma

The acting is solid although I got to know that the main actress, Yalitza Aparicio ""Cleo,"" in the film is a teacher and this is the first time for her to act, which is very impressive, her Oscar nomination she received is well deserved. While Marina de Tavira's ""Sra. Sofia,"" acting was also great, I thought that the Oscar nomination she received is slightly un-worthy.The film could be slow in some parts and quite in other parts, but this factor, in my opinion, helps the viewer sink in the characters and the plot of the film.

Told from the perspective of the family housekeeper, Cleo, the film follows her and her employer's family throughout 1971, an emotionally turbulent year for both the family and for Mexico. While the story is interesting, it's unfortunately often relegated to the second or third most interesting aspect of any scene. Cuaron's cinematography is front-and-center, and deservingly so - it's gorgeous - and his shot composition, which is often comprised of filling the frame so full of characters and tactile movement that you'll actually believe you're watching real people going about their real lives, is also astounding.

448,benps,Roma,8,1 December 2019,"Roma is the expertly made family drama, crafted together, piece by piece by the impeccable Alfonso Cúaron. The film serves as an account into a day in the life of Cleo (Yalitza Aparaicio), a maid to a middle-class Mexican family.
Roma is crowned by a wonderful sense of passion in the voice of its director, Cúaron. The sense of personality is felt strongly as much of Roma's account is drawn from inspiration of Cúaron's actual life.
In addition to directing Roma, Cúaron writes it very unconventionally and innovativley, and shoots it skilfully, beautifully using a wide range of excellent long takes and shots, and filming it entirely in black and white for even greater effect.
All around the level of effort is exhibited delightfully by the cast, most notably Yalitza Aparicio who, in a debut acting performance, impresses delightfully with a performance that exhibits a strong sense of emotion without the effort of Aparicio even having to execute much dialogue, she conveys and translates her feelings simply through mannerisms, facial expressions, and body language.
Roma also makes beautiful usage of its sound design, cleverly and loudly embracing the most unnoticeable background noises, and features stunning, effort-driven production design too.

Given the high imdb rating for Roma and its supposed universal critical acclaim from professional film critics, I decided to give this movie a try... By the end of the film, I just felt numb and swindled by the people who gave this movie such high marks.
ROMA in many ways reflect our changing and decaying times, not in terms of the content of the movie itself which does portray a decaying Mexico city in the 70s, but with regards to the polarization of our society and in this case, the strange disparity of the ratings and reviews on the movie and its even more confounding universal acclaim among movie critics from the media - Note that most reviews are either 9-10 out of 10 or 1 to 5 out of 10 on imdb.
Cinematographically, it is well shot with many long tracking or gimbal shots, framed with a masterful intent and the B&W works well to a certain extent, though nothing out of the ordinary in terms of cinematography that we haven't before: Slices of an upper-middle class Mexican family life in the 70s and the mundanity of the trials and tribulations going thru their lives and that of their servants interspersed with the larger societal upheavals of Mexico city at the time.
Storytelling wise, it is really one of the dullest and most pointless slices of life ever portrayed with such great cinematography disguised as some sort of hommage to the director's childhood.
Chantal Ackerman's Jeanne Dielman - a movie about a lonely widow doing her daily chores - strikes me as a similar film with a very low budget and yet very little camera moves that is way more powerful and effective in conveying drama. Bela Tarr's powerful movies with long tracking shots such as Satantango also convey so much more than this dull exercise by Cuaron yet feel similar in style.
Don't get me wrong, I do like quite a few of Cuaron's movies such as Y Tu Mama Tambien, Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban or Children of Men for what they are, as varied in style and form as they are. But here, I am baffled as to why ROMA gets such high praise.
In the end, I feel that ROMA reflects the times we live in, the unbearably mundane ways with which movies are released and reviewed by the media professionals and reviewers online whereby creating universal acclaim out of some of the worst movies while ignoring worthwhile great shows/films.
ROMA as an exercise of style and form over content is decent, however as a film, it is one that is unbearably hard to praise.
The main reason I feel it is worth watching is because decades from now, I think we will look back and use this movie as one of the finest examples of our decadent culture and the decaying influence of our media. ROMA's universal critical acclaim is the perfect reflection with how empty our society has become, whereby social media influencers are the most sought after workforce in society, whereby futile movies such as ROMA represent the finest of our independent filmmaker's spirit... as other reviewers said, our hollywood emperors no longer have clothes anymore...",Roma
451,knuddelholic,The movie had made Akira Kurosawa proud,8,5 June 2019,"Wow, I never thought I would see a movie with that cinematography again, that slow pacing like from an observer. No hectic of modern movies, no dramaturgy for the sake of pushing a plot.
The camera acts just like an observer to watch the lives of the spectators, the up and downs in their lives like a documentary without a narrator.
The last time I saw such simplistic but refreshing camera work was from movies from Akira Kurosawa, especially in the post war Japan.This kind of slice of life story telling got really rare these days, especially since the internet age were everything got accelerated and feels pushed, forced.
To appreciate this movie you do need empathy and patience and not expect to be entertained in any way. You go on a ride with Cleo and the household she lives and works in and that's it, period.
I felt with her all the time and felt almost sad as the credits started to roll as she and the household grew on me during the movie.
If you have trouble with the pacing of the movie, try to see it in chunks. But I think it is worth watching it. It was delightful to find such a movie like this as I do miss Kurosava very much and find that Alfonso Cuarón would make Kurosave proud with the quite similar style.
I look forward to see more from Sr. Cuarón.",Roma

The ONLY reason we watched until the end was due to the awards, thinking that certainly it will improve. It's SO slow moving that anything that seems like it might turn dramatic, like a tire rolling over dog pooh, had us anticipating some kind of major drama. But it was just a shot of a tire rolling over dog pooh. That's basically how the whole movie goes. Mexico is so beautiful and colorful, not filming in color was a huge mistake.The dark video and very poor audio meant we were basically just reading a story while trying to decipher which character was talking.If this movie is worthy of any award, the movie industry is in very sad shape.",Roma

But I gave it and me another chance days later and resumed watching. I know nothing about cinematography or any other aspects of movie making, so there's a very good chance that all that expertise fell on deaf ears and blind eyes. It was an ok movie; nothing spectacular. What I did find charming was the loving relationship between the main actress and the ""kids."" The way she tenderly put them to bed and awoke them in the morning was special. Other than that, so so. One thing that irritated me was that the subtitles were in white, and they went up against a black and white and gray movie, sometimes making it difficult to read.

I wasn't hating it, it's just that I felt I would have enjoyed rerunning Arrested Development, Archer, The Good Place, or any amount of stuff on Netflix and got more out of it. Call me chicken (Cacaw, cacaw), but I was dreading reading overwhelming positive reviews telling me what a phillistine I was. Like other touted films over the last few years, If you liked Boyhood and Moonlight you will love this. But I didn't, perhaps it strikes a chord with some, but this kind of film is not as extraordinary as the life which we are a part of. Story and characters are the thing, and no amount of cinematography can make up for lack of them.",Roma
456,dirty_chords,"Some thoughts on the masterful opening sequence. And then, some more.",9,27 February 2019,"Camera focuses on the floor, while Cleo starts cleaning up. We keep on staring down, while water starts covering the ground. Gradually, the overhead view of floor tiles reveals the reflection of the sky in the water. A plane is passing through it. You can almost imagine yourself on your knees, staring down, unable to look up. You can only see the sky as a reflection in almost still water, while cleaning up dog waste.In my humble opinion, the floor symbolizes the hard everyday life of the indigenous Mexican woman. Some have stated that it can also be a metaphor of life on earth (p.s. covered in faecal matter), while the plane symbolizes heaven. My interpretation is that the passing plane represents Cleo's dreams and ambitions; the woman she aspires to be. It doesn't necessarilly have to be something particularly grand. It can just be a desire to be loved and treated equally (as a maginalized native Mexican living in the early 70s, this is actually everything she could have ever asked for).Now, let's try to compare this magnificent sequence to the closing shot: Cleo climbs the stairs, while camera points to the sky, which we can now see directly. Our point of view makes it seem like Cleo can raise her hand and touch the plane that is once again passing through. These two sequences shine as a masterpiece on their own.Roma's images had so much more to say than a conventional voiceover would ever come remotely close to. Yet, some chose to give them a blank stare. What a waste. I mean, it's perfectly understandable when you're used to bad sreenplays that impose the films message upon viewers. But a picture is worth a thousand words, and Roma's rich black and white images are works of art that convey many different themes in the most efficient possible way.Roma is a fresh take on the genre of neorealism, and at the same time a trully unique coming of age film; a maturing process towards the fullness (and the full understanding) of someone's existence. Its narrative works in three different dimensions: It's the maturation of an indigenous woman; the maturation of a middle class family during the parents' divorce; and finally, the maturation of a whole nation (Corpus Christi massacre). Pain, suffering, loss and big emotions are the key to this process taking place.This film is, hands down, the greatest cinematic achievement of the year. It's crazy (and at the same time not surprising at all) to think that it lost Best Picture to the epitome of an ""Oscar bait"" movie (""Green Book""). Academy still has a long way to go in order to reach maturity; not unlike the average viewer (just give some imdb user reviews a go and you will understand).",Roma

If you like these classics you might be like this movie too.
The storyline pretty boring, the whole movie kind of negative. The characters are lovely, I didn't find any character I can relate.

There is no real narrative so you're basically a voyeur watching a period of the maid and the family's lives unfold - the mundane and compelling events intertwined in such a realistic unscripted sort of way that you feel as if you're living it with them.

466,elliot-75668,Epic and intimate,10,3 December 2018,"Alfonso Cuaron's last film was quite literally out of this world yet his latest effort brings him back to Earth but with a story no less epic and profound. Roma is partly based on the director's life but is told through the eyes of the nanny/maid, Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio), whose experiences reveal the extent of classism and racism in 1970s Mexico.It's been almost 18 years since Cuaron made a film in his native language but he felt the time was right to return to his mother tongue and craft a revealing tale of class and racial struggle. The film is told through Cleo's (based on Cuaron's real maid, Lido) eyes and this unique way of telling the story gives the film a special insight into social issues in Mexico. Nanny/maid characters in films are usually bit parts in films, seen frequently but heard speaking only fleetingly. Cleo is always on hand to tend to the families every need, yet she is always on the outside. She is loved but never fully treated as part of family as she is ordered to do things only a servant would (it is always very uncomfortable when this happens).This is evident simply in how her treatment in plain for all to see. Cleo (and her co-worker) stays in a separate part of the house that's vastly different to the luxurious brightly lit interiors of the main house. Whether the entire family are together, she's always on the side whether its kneeling on the floor whilst the family watch tv or standing, nearly out of frame, as the others sit on bench eating an ice cream. That's not to say the family are uncaring or dismissive of her, the kids revere her greatly but her race and class separates her from truly belonging in the household.As we see the world through Cleo's eyes all these things become glaringly obvious even if the camera simply observes (like a ghost from the past as Cuaron said) life happening before it. As we see the world through Cleo's eyes we see her heartbreak, her pain and suffering in her most testing times (the most traumatic being the scene shortly following The Corpus Christi Massacre). Not only that we get a vital look at prejudice from someone who at the centre of it. Spending so much time with her, it's easy to notice the subtlest of prejudices. Oaxaca born Yalitza Aparicio restrained and moving performance is one of heart-breaking quiet poignancy as she provides a voice for the disenfranchised.Working on his first feature film since Prisoner of Azkaban without his regular cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki (if you can't get Lubezki you may as well do it yourself), Cuaron forgoes the long handheld take technique of Children of Men and the exciting fluidity of Gravity and instead adopts a slow panning technique that resembles a casual observer. Much like Tokyo Story, Cuaron's camera simply observes the family unit, taking a non-judgemental and objective view of upper middle class of Mexico thereby allowing the viewer to notice the subtle elements of racism without ever explicitly mentioning them.That said, Roma is not without its visual flourishes. The beautiful black and white cinematography transport us to the hustle and bustle of Roma region of Mexico City. The long, tracking shots reveal so much about the film's setting, taking us into the world inhabited by Cleo. The sound design allows us to experience the world in which the film is set. The chaos of Mexico City, the honking of horns and roar of plane engines above (hinting at an unreachable faraway world) makes the city feel alive and more than just a distant memory.The most important aspect of the film is that it gives a voice to the voiceless and oppressed. It was only when Cuaron began to ask Lido (the maid on which the story is based) about her life that he began to recognise her as a real person with a life outside the home. These talks were perhaps as revealing and eye opening to Cuaron as the film Roma is to us. Understated and moving, Roma is a slow-moving film where, for a while, seemingly nothing happens but it's one that rewards a patient viewer with a highly emotional experience.",Roma

468,junshiwilda,A cinematic masterpiece I wish I was able to watch on theater.,10,12 June 2019,"Roma is probably one of the movies that anger me it's not on the top 250 along with my favorite movie of all time JFK. This was nominated for 10 Oscars including best picture (won 3 including Best Director) and was universally acclaimed by critics. Yet, this movie doesn't make it into the top 250 where a bunch of Bollywood musicals make it in. Yes this movie requires you to have a taste for experimental art house films, but there is no excuse why this is not in the top 250. Out of this year's Best Picture nominees this is the most beautifully made film that truly deserved Academy attention.Roma perhaps is the most successful experimental film ever made. Many film makers failed to deliver realism on screen, but here Alfonso Cuaron truly delivers. Dogma 95, an artistic movement started by Lars Von Trier tried to bring realism to screen by using hand held cameras and decreasing the quality of the editing as much as possible. Though I have never seen his movies it is pretty clear from the trailers of his movies that this is not working at all since Dogma 95 films, or all Von Trier films in general seem to just be shot purposefully bad rather than being realistic. But here Cuaron delivers realism in the screen masterfully through the sound. There is such detail in the sound from the sound of the water dripping, the noisy streets, the waves it feels like being suck into the screen. Through out the film I was just locked in not because of the plot but because of these attention of details in sound. This all makes this film succeed artistically where no film in the past ever has been, and gave me a very unique beautiful experience.Not only is the sound phenomenal but in general this is a movie that is perfectly crafted. You can see Cuaron paying attention to every single detail possible. As I mentioned a paragraph earlier, there is perfect attention to sound in this film to achieve the artistic goal of realism. The same can be said with the plot. Cuaron finds every single detail that can be found in daily life. Not a lot of significant events happen in the movie in the first half of the movie, and Cuaron takes advantage of that. You can see Cuaron showing his artistic ability portraying daily family life and struggles masterfully. This is why when there is a important plot point in the middle of the movie you actually feel like actually being there because Cuaron made us sucked into the screen like we are part of the movie in the first half using realism. The climax of the movie in the beach is very powerful because of the establishment of realism in the first half. You can feel the experience the characters are having, the emotions they are having in the beach like actually being there. How Cuaron created a story that makes audiences get sucked into the screen is truly a cinematic achievement. The performances are all just perfect from the leads to even the child actors. It is not neccesarily the type of performance that will be remembered forever, but they're performance playing characters like ordinary people plays a big part on achieving this phenomenal experience. This is exactly why Roma can be described by only one word; perfection.Overall this is a phenomenal movie that deserves every single praise it is receiving. Regardless whether you like art house films or big blockbusters you will have a unforgettable beautiful experience. Cuaron will suck you into the screen with each beautifully shot sequences and a plot that is perfectly crafted. Though I don't give a lot of these out, I rate this a 10/10. I suggest you check this right away if you have a Netflix account. If you don't, do whatever you can to watch this masterpiece.",Roma
469,diegojosmer,Stunning,9,15 December 2018,"Roma is a breathtaking masterpiece. I had been waiting to watch this movie for two reasons: the first was that I've been following the award season coverage and knew that Roma would be a mayor player this season; the second was that Alfonso Cuarón is one of the leading Mexican directors in the industry and me being Mexican I was dying to see a film that reflected the culture of this country.
The movie follows the life of a Mexican domestic helper who has a special bond with the family she works with. The main thing about the movie is how beautiful and cinematic it is. This is a deeply personal and intimate story, and the cinematography by Alfonso Cuarón captures that and more. I was a little worried the film being black and white, but the end result I can only continue to describes as beautiful.
The story itself was slow pacing, but that's the reason why the movie works so well. It's a slow burn that just keeps going until you realize you deeply care for our main character. The way the story builds is a really great way of Alfonso Cuarón showcasing how perfectly he can construct a story.
Unfortunately, the city where I live in had no theatre showings so I saw it on my tv. This is quality filmmaking at its best, and if your have the chance to see it on a theatre you definitely should grab the chance. Alfonso Cuarón has continued to show how much of a master he is with a camera and I can't wait to see what he does next.",Roma
470,cinemaloversclub,A Masterclass in Film,10,8 March 2019,"Gorgeously filmed in auteur vintage black-and-white with cultural vibrancy & a powerful elegiac critique of 1970's Mexico turmoil on a personal Cuarón semi-autobiographical scale, Roma is one of the decade's greatest films. 9.7/10....Review: Absolute brilliance. Cuarón has done it again with a poetic, moving semi-autobiographical take on what he saw growing up in the tumultuous social and political time of his homeland. The visual style and groundbreaking technical work is breathtaking and unprecedented, lifting long-unseen camera profiles from panning to long-tracking shots straight out of film textbooks, as well as crisp cinematography cleverly playing on juxtapostitions of extreme orderliness and balance in everything down to the floor patterns to the chaos of the time, boosted by the decision to go vintage Golden Hollywood-feeling gorgeous black-and-white sleek with auteurism and film history appreciation. The cultural vibrancy of the location and time-period, as well as the fact it's a Foreign Language film through and through even forcing non-Spanish speakers to watch through subtitles (as most non-Americans worldwide have to do for Hollywood); it's extremely refreshing and creates an escapism and authentic glimpse into the Mexican heritage and diversity in every brushstroke by Cuarón. The personal, Greek tragedy-like, emotionally-resonant, and intimate family-centered storytelling set against the backdrop of this massive-scale political and social turmoil (with horrifying protest/disaster scenes), is incredible too and well-set in its later payoffs, bolstered by some *brilliant* performances led by indigenous and star-making Yalitza Aparicio as poor Cleo, Marina de Tavira as Sofi, and Jorge Guerro as the downright evil Fermín. Despite an overlong single-shot opening credits sequence, somewhat finality-lackluster closing shot, and bizarre penchant to for indulging negative (and untrue) stereotypes like the bad female driver and absent father (included twice for good measure! Is it really a modern Hollywood film if they don't take a few generalizing jabs at men *sigh*), these are minuscule, overlookable gripes in what is otherwise an absolutely BRILLIANT film.

477,7DeadlyThings,7 Things About Roma,10,25 February 2019,"1. The MemoriesRoma is set in the early 1970s following a young domestic worker living in the middle-class neighborhood of Roma, Mexico City.Oscar-winner director Alfonso Cuarón (Children of Men, Gravity) takes us on a deeply personal journey in an autobiographical ode to his childhood, and to the women who reared him.""Eighty to ninety percent of the scenes represented in the film are scenes taken out of my memory,"" Cuarón said during a Directors Guild of America interview, ""sometimes directly, sometimes a bit more obliquely.""2. The CharactersJust as the memories are real, so are the characters, including Cleo, played to perfection by Yalitza Aparicio, who had no previous acting experience. Cleo is a fictionalised version of the Cuarón family's live-in-maid Liboria ""Libo"" Rodríguez.Cuarón embarked on a painstaking search through countless villages in Mexico auditioning thousands of women for the role. When he met Aparicio, who is from the same small town as Libo, his search was over.3. The Corpus Christi MassacreCuarón draws on his childhood amidst political turmoil of the 1970s, most notably the devastating Corpus Christi massacre of 1971. Soldiers and police disguised as civilians opened fire on thousands of high school and university student demonstrators killing over 120 people.4. The MasculinityIn many movies being made right now men seem to be suffering from a form of toxic masculinity syndrome - a disorder associated with brutal, abusive behaviour, with tendencies to lie, cheat, and often drink too much, ultimately letting everyone and themselves down.Roma serves as a testament to the women who raised Cuarón who are left to pick up the pieces after being betrayed by the men in their lives.5. The CinematographyAlong with directing the picture, Cuarón wrote the screenplay and also helmed the cinematography.Due to a scheduling conflict Cuarón's go-to guy, and three-time Oscar winner Emmanuel Lubezki, who has worked with him on almost every film he has made, was unavailable, leading Cuarón to step into the role himself.This decision ended up being hugely beneficial to the creative process and the result is stunning.6. The SimplicityThere are plenty of high-impact parts throughout: a blazing forest fire; an earthquake; violent street riots; and an unsettling seaside scene.But it's the softer scenes that say so much. Cuarón has a talent of making the ordinary seem extraordinary: soapy water sloshing across a courtyard; a plane reflected in a puddle; laundry swaying on a clothesline.These moments of magic seem like a dream - these memories of one of the greatest directors of our time.7. The ScoreThere isn't really a score as such, the soundtrack to Cuarón's latest opus is made up of an occasional song drifting in and out of a radio or stereo, the rumble of city streets, cars vrooming, people babbling, waves crashing, fireworks, rifles, dogs... the sound design is instrumental to the experience allowing us to completely immerse ourselves into this world.",Roma

Please be more careful about your watching habits and what you select to view. Read the fine print and don't unfairly inflict your uninformed ratings and commentaries on the rest of us. It's particularly unfair to the filmmaker as you drag the ratings down and misinform potential viewers. This is a masterpiece and should be treated as such.",Roma

The movie is all black and white, which is a very bold move and the plot is awesome and very well constructed.
It has an atmosphere that gets you in it and convinces you of what's happening at that time and you really feel empathy for the characters.
And I finish with the photography, even being almost the whole movie inside the house it still has a great photography, always using the landscape point of view. Love it!",Roma

The basis is not only the story but also art just like in La La Land and Cold War, while there are techniques of camera and shots and the way the movie goes that reminds the way old movies were made (those of Bergman, Ozu etc) with great work from director. Everything is almost perfect, we see a city of 1970 with cars and houses of its time, scenes that are too many to remember, soundtracs that never stop, cinematography that bring works in the whole movie, things that were happening like protest of students and them being killed, what Cuaron has probably seen in that time, and after all it is also about a family, the story goes on while we see dialogues and events of real life, making it a kind if Boyhood. Im comparing it with many great movies because I saw many of them in Roma. Its a masterpiece of Mexico and Hollywood is not being able to bring movies like this today. Sadly Roma will likely stop at best foreign due to Oscar politics.",Roma
484,AbhinavAnnam,Portraying the depth of human emotions to perfection.,9,18 March 2020,"Roma. A movie with flawless performances by all the actors. I was astonished to quite an extent when I read that the actress who played Cleo, the central character was a debutant. Her performance stands out. At various scenes in the movie, she nails her expressions to perfection. Alfonso Cuaron, the man, deserves all the credit. He directed the film, wrote the screenplay and was the cinematographer. The cinematography was beautiful! So was the screenplay. Roma definitely is meant to be a slow, character driven film filled with many scenes which are heartwarming. During many scenes, I found myself praising Alfonso Cuaron for the extent to which this film feels real. Of course, the entire movie is in black and white and I can say it affects the film in a good way. The music is beautiful too. Overall, after watching Roma, I find myself developing a growing interest in international films and also slow films. However, I'd like to mention that slow cinema isn't everybody's cup of tea. People may find it boring since there's not much of a plot which I don't think it's bad. But if you're a fan of character driven films, go watch Roma. One of the best films of 2018 easily.",Roma

This certainly helps as the film takes its time establishing the central character, her day-to-day routines and the relationships around her. The documentary feel of the film and the observational nature of the camera at times keeps the audience at arm's length from the central character, in much the same way that the family appears to do, especially in the first half of the film, but this gives way to a much more involving second half, as plot points and events build to some highly difficult and emotional moments.",Roma

So the filming is great, photography is awesome, the acting is splendid (really all the emotions were great) and the historical context is well written. But the plot and the end lack of strength. And they are the main elements of a movie. Cuarón said it himself: it's written from his own memories. And feels that way: it's like trying to fit pieces from different puzzles.

494,cory_j_adams,Life as it happens,10,29 January 2019,"Let me start out by saying that Roma (2018) is something that I feel I've never experienced before. I've seen many personal films but this one isn't just personal. Sr. Cuarón here gives a glimpse into his heart, and transports us into a universe of feeling that envelopes the viewer in such a way that you can't help but watch.Roma is easily one of the most beautiful films of the last twenty years. Everything about it is nearly impeccable: the direction, the cinematography, the editing, the set design, the acting, the story. It all comes together to give us a glimpse into something we all take for granted: life. We are brought into the life of a simple maid of a middle class Mexican family who is simply living right in front of our eyes. I see many low ratings and reviews here stating that the film was ""boring"" and ""had no story"". Those of you who wrote these reviews obviously do not have a true grasp on the art of cinema. What makes seeing movies so great is being able to see life as it happens and to relate to the characters on screen and what happens to them. Roma does this tremendously. The story is deceptively simple, and yet you feel as if you are watching an epic sprawl out before you.Alfonso Cuarón has outdone himself here. Putting every fiber of his being into this motion picture. In every frame you see a glimpse of him and the experiences he has had in life. One thing I appreciated immensely was his choice to do the film in black and white as it gave the film timelessness that really made you feel as if you were watching someone's life play out right before you. That and his choice of camera work. The long extended scenes that allowed you to take everything in, every detail. It's breathtaking.Now I must comment on the acting which, as an aspiring actor, is my favorite part of any film. Here it is one of the things that elevates the film to a masterpiece. Yalitza Aparicio, an unknown before this film, here delivers one of the most astonishingly human performances I've ever seen on film. You can see every emotion she feels written on her face, to the point where she doesn't have to say anything to convey what she's feeling. It's a tremendous performance that deserves to be seen by everyone who can see it. And of course, we can't leave out Marina de Tavira. Her performance is one of the films most startling. You see this film is essentially about two women. The story is focused on Cleo, we see everything through her eyes and experiences. And this is how we see Sra. Sofía. She is essentially in the background most of the time. But de Tavira's performance reveals so much. Little by little, we are shown a broken and abandoned woman. A mother who is simply trying to keep her family together, and pick herself back up in the process. It's a subtly heartbreaking performance, and has easily become one of my favorite performances by an actress this year.I can't heap enough praise on this film, so I'll just say this: if you have an appreciation for great cinema, see this film. Because I promise you, it's one of the most immersive and emotionally astounding films you'll ever see.",Roma

I don't and maybe that's why it didn't resonate with me at all. Now, I'm a huge fan of Baraka and Samsara where not a single word of dialogue is spoken yet the imagery on-screen absolutely captivates you. Roma is similar in that, well, not a whole lot of anything happens. There is dialogue, there is some drama occasionally, but, for the most part there's absolutely nothing happening. To give you an idea, the film starts with 4 minutes of watching water on the floor. I kept thinking ""maybe there will be some profound moment, even just a single line of dialogue, where this all comes together for me"" and, for me at least, that never happened.I am giving this four stars though, because the craftsmanship behind this film is absolutely phenomenal. Cinematography, sound, editing. The film is marvelous in those aspects. But that's quite simply not enough to make a 2 hr 15 minute film worthwhile.The overwhelmingly glowing praise for this film has me wondering if people actually liked it that much or if they're more akin to the art exhibit patrons lining the block in ""Exit Through the Gift Shop"".",Roma

I give her a nod and a smile, and then she looks away. I am absolutely fine; ROMA did this to me.as I grapple for the words to express how I feel, I can't help but look back to how this all came to be. how I've longed to see this movie, how I've read every critic review, how I promised myself to see it in theatre - all of this, yet not knowing what to expect.but Alfonso Cuarón has not made a movie. he's carefully crafted an experience; one filled with love, and grief, hope and betrayal; one filled with reality and truth. and he's invited us in, with his hands over our eyes, like a mother leading her child to a surprise.following the end credits, I breathed a deep sigh, thankful that I experienced this in the theatre - not only is it a gorgeously visual experience, it's auditory quality is gracious and lush. there's little to no music, but that is deliberate - you feel every sound (in 4K atmos too), carefully designed to immerse you in this world that Alfonso has created, but Yalitza Aparicio has executed, with acting as opulent as it is captivating.maybe it's me being too vulnerable, and I just might be overselling it, but this film is truly in a world of its own.and so I close my eyes.

The film has some glorious camera work, as many have pointed out, and a plot/story that isn't actually as boring as some might have you think, with some rather impressive scenes, however in amongst a solid piece of work are some rather painful self-indulgences (forest scene for one) and a few obvious anachronisms that distract from it.

In fairness though, there are a few redeeming moments - not minutes - of interest in this two hour and fifteen minute experiment in self imposed sleep deprivation.I strongly suggest you take note of reviewers giving this experiment for induced narcolepsy anything above a five, unless you are young AND have plenty of time to waste watching more of their recommendations.",Roma

Boring doesn't begin to encapsulate this insulting ""film"". Don't get it twisted, I am not a a Hollywood blockbuster film watcher. I'd rather see an indi film, foreign film, low budget anything than sit through anything with pyrotechnics. But this story of a maid and the family she serves, should have never even got past the, ""WTF were you thinking?"" phase after a first draft script reading. The acting is great but how burdensomely dull is it's content. Slow and wandering are not great adjectives when describing a story but perfect for this bland picture about characters that never get to a point where you care at all what is happening to them. I've never wanted to walk out before a movie was over before, but I ran out of the theater when it finally was. This is a failure in every aspect. Zero stars.",Roma
509,albfcc,Superb in so many ways!,10,30 December 2018,"This movie is superb is so many ways -- in its ambition, its portrayal of human caring and in its cinematic execution. The film was written and directed by Alfonso Cuaron and shot in black and white. It tells the story of an upper middle-class Mexican family and their caring housekeeper-child-care worker Cleo, played by the incomparable Yalitza Aparicio.The acting is amazing, from individual performances to ensemble playing. That said this movie is not for everyone. First, it moves very slowly at times - and then it speeds up dramatically. If you are an impatient movie-watcher (as I am most times), this one is not for you. Basically it tell the tale of a dysfunctional, marriage, the consequences for the children, and how Cleo responds to various challenges. That is a whole lot of short-hand, but I am trying not to reveal much.The way I found enhanced my appreciation of the film is to watch each scene unfold studiously. Observe what is happening in the corners of the frame, especially since it is often shot from a distant view. Something meaningful is always going on, whether it pertains to plot, character development or cinematic beauty.If I found some imperfections in the film, they are these: 1) At Cleo's crisis moment, she could have screamed. This would have added power to her portrayal and to the movie as a whole (even if some would say it would have been out of character). 2) When the mom behaves irresponsibly at the end of the film her state of mind is not sufficiently foreshadowed.Finally, you may wonder: ""Why should I watch this movie?"" My answer is that the character of Cleo is emblematic of many of the world's long-suffering but dedicated and indispensable women. This judgment is not in the sense of a lesson that you must take, but in the sense of a warm human story that is rewarding to watch.",Roma

You cannot see where the story is going because it is just that: a documentary on the assymetry of social conditions in Mexico.

528,lm_meireles,What if...,9,28 December 2018,"We all know by Cuarón's work that he isn't the most prolific of directors, and also that he doesn't reach the highest of personal levels in his filmmaking. In Roma, though, we must forget those facts: it is the most intimate we can get from the Mexican. This is a movie made essentially of emotions (and beautiful shots), where Mr. Cuarón takes almost all the credits (direction, photography, edition, writing, production).In the opening credits, we get to see a still shot of what seems to be someone cleaning a tile floor. The water reflects the sky and there's a plane slowly passing by: we're outside. This kind of wavy motion of the water made me recall Fernando Pessoa, who, in Mensagem, wrote:
""Deus ao mar o perigo e o abismo deu,
Mas nele é que espelhou o céu.""
Something tragic is about to unfold before our eyes.Suddenly, the camera shifts its angle and we meet Cleo, the young girl that characterizes Libo, the person that Cuarón dedicated the movie to and whose identity I don't want to reveal. She speaks Spanish with a dog. In a hurry, leaves the house where we believe she is a housekeeper and walks to the nursery, picking up a little boy, Pepe. As she returns home, other girl tells her that Fermín is on the phone, waiting to talk to her. He's her new boyfriend. As the girls are talking, the rest of the family gets home, but we don't see the father, who is leaving to Quebec for work next Friday. At the end of the day, the father returns, still earlier than usual. He is presented as a superior character, hearing classical music and smoking inside a big car, with some difficulties to park it inside the house, as he also can't avoid the dog's feces: he doesn't really fit in this place.In the evening, the family gathers in the leaving room watching TV and we see the mother's ""jealousy"": she asks Cleo to bring a tea to the father, when the kids start to embrace her. Before the end of the day and everyone goes to sleep (possibly the best photographed scene is seen here), we hear the couple fighting in their room.Some other day, Cleo and Adela (the other housekeeper) go to the movies with their boyfriends. The first one changes her mind when Fermín asks her to take a walk instead, ending both in a room. Fermín talks about his hard days as a teen. Then, they have sex.Cleo wakes up Friday morning. The following events change the whole scenario.When Antonio, the father, is about to leave, Sofía, his wife, holds him and kisses him, very strongly: something's not right, and we start to doubt about this father figure (maybe he is leaving definitely). A military band passes by their house, which, for me, symbolizes the dark days that this family is about to experience. This time, the mother is the one who walks the young Pepe to the nursery, after shouting with Cleo to clean the dog's feces. While she does it, we hear the plane passing by again and we're taken to the cinema, where Fermín and Cleo are kissing. She, then, reveals that she might be pregnant and the boy disappears, leaving the poor girl helpless.Cleo's thoughts wander while she looks at a hail storm. Again, Mr. Cuarón is telling us that something went very wrong. It is time for her to ask her bosses for help, which she does. At the same time, the grandmother, Teresa, is speaking to her daughter about Antonio's departure. We are now sure: this movie is about these two women, whose men left them behind, and what they'll do to make it without them.The big difference between these two is that Sofi, in contrast with Cleo, never had to fight for nothing, which is clearly seen by the way she drives her car, when both women go to the hospital. But, at least, she has a car and, possibly, a license to drive it, something unthinkable for people like Cleo.Inside the hospital, we learn, in one hand, that Fermín is the only man who had intercourse with Cleo. In the other hand, the drama between Sofi and Antonio intensifies as she talks with Dr. Zavala about her relationship problems. An earthquake hits the town while Cleo contemplates a new born baby (who probably died following that moment). We shift to some new place where some Christian crosses are shown. This is where the director starts to ""overemphasize"" with his symbolism. Wasn't the ""omen"" brought by the previous scene enough to tell us that, maybe, her baby is sentenced? Why do we need this shot for? It doesn't even stand at the level of the majority of the picture's frames. In this moment, we start to question Mr. Cuarón's (not so) subtle way to warn us.The family spends the Christmas holidays in the countryside with some other bourgeois families that speak some English. This is possibly the most boring part of the movie and it only serves the director's mission to, once again, clarify that Cleo and Sofi live in different worlds: didn't we already know that? The New Year starts with another one or two hints of tragedy. Cleo doesn't want to have toast with her ""low class"" friend, but when she agrees, some other woman hits her: the glass falls, and breaks. When she leaves the room where all the servants were celebrating, a fire starts to consume the woods. At this point, I'm starting to doubt the story and who wrote it, even more when all the people (including children) are helping to extinguish the fire and a mysterious man, shown before, starts to sing something... well, something! Before returning home, Cleo walks through the fields with the exact same woman who pushed her and talks about how that place reminds her home. Cleo doesn't talk that much, so we must listen when she does, even if it means nothing...The sunny breeze turns into a rainy day: the family's back home. Their big Maverick that Sofi scratched is now fixed. Antonio, though, still ain't home. Toño, the oldest of the brothers, wants to go to the cinema. Antonio is there. Cinema is now a place related with betrayal, and we must never forget Fermín, who Cleo ultimately finds in a martial arts training. The most important moment of this scene, apart from the fact that Fermín leaves Cleo helpless once again, is that, when Profesor Zovek, a famous figure in Mexico, challenges people to pose in a certain way with their eyes closed, Cleo is the only one who can accomplish the demand: she is the movie's strongest character, and she'll make through this storm.Everything seems to be in a downfall: the kids fight in the afternoon and, in the evening, Sofía returns home drunk: ""We're alone. (...) We, women, are always alone!"". Cleo doesn't reply. Did she need to hear that? Did we? And did we need to hear that, in the following scene, where we clearly see people protesting that they're protesting? If Cuarón wants to make an allusion to something, well, he has to be specific, not just talk about violence and leave the matter like that. He really made an effort to show us a reality that his people lived, but, somehow, failed: what follows is the movie's worst scene.After we get a ""cliché"" kind of piece of story, we reach the movie's emotional ""clímax"" (and its best scene, in my opinion). This is where the director shines. All we can do now is to keep quiet and simply look at the screen. If we pay attention around us, we'll then notice an empty, but understandable, silence, a silence that matches the birds' and the dogs' sounds, colored by frames where we see the family's neighborhood and house.Cleo is now a different, maybe stronger woman. Sofía buys a new, smaller car. The family goes to the beach. Sofía tells the children the truth about their father. They face it with different reactions: Toño freezes, Paco cries more than everyone else, the young Sofi hugs Cleo and little Pepe just seems to have some anger inside, leaving us with no clear understanding of what he's feeling. They talk about divorce and then sit silently eating ice-cream next to some couple getting married, which reminded me of how good Cuarón can actually be, sometimes.When the family finally confronts the sea of problems surrounding them, the movie seems to be over. As they return home, the same military band passes by. Same thing happens with the plane. The sunlight is now strong. Cleo wants to talk with Adela, and not the other way around. Everything's in its right place now.I preferred not to talk about the movie's core issue/subject matter, so that people go on and see it like I did. When we reach the end, there's nothing more than that issue to really deeply think about. Not always easy to see, this is a touching movie, but not a perfect one. When we start to imagine other ways Cuarón had to pull this off, we reach the conclusion that it could've been his best movie, because it'd certainly be one of the best movies of the decade. Doing things in his own flawed fashion, he made a flawed movie, but certainly one that's worth watching and re-watching.",Roma

537,kashmirlayla,The mural and the close-up: Mexico City in the 1970s,9,8 December 2018,"I did not know what to expect going into this movie. I came out thoroughly overwhelmed by the emotional impact of the protagonist Cleo's story. But what really gets you is the sense you have, while watching, that Cleo and the other main characters are deeply implicated in an entire larger world, a world re-created for a film but that is so detailed, complex, and vibrant that it feels startlingly real. As such, the dense energy of an entire society seems to be conveyed to us through the quiet and unassuming figure of a lowly maid, the type of person until recently rarely chosen as the center of such an epic look at a time and place, but who emerges as epitomizing the best that society has to offer.As a result, the film is a sort of bourgeois family-saga told through the margins. The story may have an allegorical significance for Mexican society at large. A white family is almost destroyed as its patriarch gives up and takes off, abandoning his wife, four children, the two maids and dog. As everyone is let down by his betrayal, it is Cleo, the indigenous maid, who holds everyone together, through the quiet strength of her loyalty and stability.The film's plot, though, has garnered much less interest than its visuals, of which much has already been made. They are indeed stunning, and do seem to be modeled after the great Mexican tradition of muralism, a consciously social and political art form that portrays moments of great upheaval and change through a panoramic, long-view of Mexican society.However, for me the great success of the film is precisely its success in shifting between the small and the big: it imbeds the close-up, fine-grained story of Cleo and her employer's family within the greater tapestry of the larger world of Mexico City in the 1970s. Throughout the film, the turmoil of the latter increasingly encroaches upon the world of the family's house. In the end, it was the back-and-forth between the intimacy we begin to feel with the characters, the emotional impact of their story and their search for a new equilibrium, and the greater sense we have of an outside world similarly roiled by instability and unforeseeable changes.",Roma

Please, someone tells Cuaron that using black and white photography does not make it a cult movie. Was that his intention?
Dreadful performances by both actress.

546,christianf22,When cinematography it's everything.,6,14 December 2018,"Roma are the memories of a year (1970-1971) in the youth of filmmaker Alfonso Cuaron when he show us a representation of the everyday in his house located in the Roma colony after his father decide to leave his family and with a special attention in Cleo's point of view and her future pregnant situation. Cuarón give us a very close, impressive and intimate experience thanks to his great cinematography skills and his powerful visual language, who remember me so much to the work of his all life coworker Emmanuel Lubezki who couldn't work in this production due to schedule conflicts. But Cuaron uses Lubezki language in the most effective and glorious way to the point you can't believe this is not a Lubezki work and definitely this is the best cinematography work of the year and one in history. Glorious work in this point Mr. Cuaron.But this movie remembers me so much to my experience when I saw Mean Streets (Martin Scorsese, 1973) and this is not good because in few words: There's no story in practically 80% of the movie. Actually there's a point in the half of the movie when I was thinking ""This is going to somewhere?"" Exactly my experience when I saw Mean Streets for first time. It's only an representation of this house and family, there's no line to follow, there's no form, no motivation, only with the exception of the Cleo's pregnancy story, the shooting (the famous Halconazo) and the Mrs Sofia matrimony situation. This 3 points for itselfs aren't capable of supports the 135 minutes of the movie in time and narrative way. The cinematography gives that support, if this movie didn't have this perfect cinematography the movie would be a boring tribute of the Italian wave of the 60's and 70's.

It's so hard for me to describe what made this special to me, but I think it comes down to just how alive it was. It was a little slice of a normal, happy and sad life of Cleo, and the people around her.There's so much to unpack in this, but what really stood out was the acting, direction, sound design and especially cinematography. Roma represents Cuarón at his best and most confident as a storyteller, and the intimacy of Roma is almost too hard to bear.I do want to touch on the hospital scene, though. It's the tensest I've been in the cinema in a long time, and it was all done in masterfully choreographed single-angle takes that ended up lasting well beyond several minutes. When I saw the liveless little baby body, I broke down, harder than I think I've ever done at a film. The brutality of seeing the doctors cover the child in the background while Cleo was still in her birthgiving position was too much to handle.When she finally makes peace with herself at the beach, saying that she didn't really want the child, and the family all hug her, it almost hit me even more than the hospital. The fact that she realised that she has more love from the family than she could ever need, and that she loves them just as much was the perfect wrap-up of such a beautiful character arc.Roma is a masterpiece. I can't wait to see it again. I had to call both my parents after seeing it.

Besides, can anyone tell how 70s Mexico contributes to the story? And does this contribution justify the budget spent on decor and costume?

Students (hundreds and hundreds of them) were peacefully protesting (as it was happening all around the world, but particularly in France). The Tlatelolco Square had, I think, three points of entry. Those were blocked with all the students, teachers and the army inside. Nowhere to hide. Then an elite paramilitary group started shooting. They even searched all the apartments sorrounding the square and kept with the executions. I mention this because many people don't know how bad it was in the aftermath. If you want to know more (and if you can find it), there's a tough heartbreaking movie that depicts all this. I don't know how they titled it in English, but in Spanish is Rojo Amanecer (Red Dawn).So, the sociopolitical situation in Roma is this aftermath. It's a VERY realistic and raw movie.Now, three generations of empowered women in Cuaron's movie is just marvelous. Can't say more because I hate spoilers.Just watch the movie.

No story other than watching the lives of the families like done with a cam corder. I don't know what is the basis of any good reviews other than authenticity in look.

I understand why some people cannot connect with the movie and see it as a slow, tedious drag. But it certainly is much more than that.

570,nmrichardson,"Listen, watch and feel closely",10,12 April 2019,"As with his other ensemble masterpiece, Chidren of Men (2006), Roma proves Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron to be yet again one of cinema's finest auteurs. In both movies, you have a vulnerable pregnant young woman. In both, men prove themselves to be treacherous and unreliable, though even more so in Roma. Having just finished it, I think there are only two male characters in the whole film that you can have some confidence in, and one is a self-important (but appealing) spiritual strongman, and the other is a house-servant who is given hardly any lines, but is gracious and unassuming in the way he opens doors for others.In both films, the busy background scenes are integral in communicating the director's message to the viewer, although equally significant in Roma are the sounds (dogs barking, taps dripping, birds singing, and - most of all - aircraft flying overhead). The almost constant backdrop of crowd scenes provides a useful counterpoint or supplement to what is going in the main characters' heads and hearts - that is, Cleo, the maid (Yalitza Aparecido) and Sofia, the lady of the house. Cuaron is a genius at forcing us through the camera to linger on details which otherwise we might overlook and you feel that he could make an entirely different action movie if he were to focus on the shoot-outs and football matches and forest fires and earthquakes that manifest themselves throughout.Roma is a soulful, agonising, beautiful, tender film and entirely deserving of all the plaudits its received. It merits your full focus so don't do anything else while watching it and give particular attention to the imagery and the sounds. You will be richly rewarded.",Roma

Roma is just not about Cleo but also about the very delicate and minute aspects about our lives which the director has portrayed brilliantly through his cinematography and genius camera work . The shots are slow , the frames are very detailed and unparalleledly realistic . In some sense Roma also intends to show the plight of the women in Mexico of 1969-70 , which is even relavent today but that's not the objective of Roma . Roma is about showing an extremely normal setting in an extremely detailed and flawless way. If you are a person interested in thrill ,action , pace and suspense , then Roma will disappoint you.

The editor needs a slap on the wrist because every shot was about ten seconds longer than needed, and it's mentally exhausting waiting for a cut several seconds after where it naturally feels one should be. This movie could easily be 30 minutes shorter without so much dead space. Next, the script and story structure are both awful. One hour in, I still had no clue who the characters were, what they wanted, or what the movie was even about. Then the movie just randomly ends after a travesty happens to the main character, leaving the audience with their hands up like ""..... that's it?""The only good thing going for this film is the cinematography and direction, although I think Cuaron got a little carried away with his wide shots, deep focus, and long takes. It reminded me of a movie from the 50's where everything is filmed from far away like you're watching a play on stage, and movies aren't made like that anymore. However, I did appreciate the mise-en-scene. You can tell that each long take took a lot of work with the timing and so many characters in each frame.

Moving on to the plot itself, I guess it will be difficult for people from different backgrounds to connect with the real meaning of this film due to the fact that is common in latin american households to live this reality and grow up having a domestic maid living in your home, sharing your pain and victory, happiness and defeats and yet being overlooked in so so many ways that in all honesty saddened me a lot as these women due to their socio economic status find a stable salary working as maids, and end up raising children that aren't theirs, sacrifice their own needs and family in order to provide for them while looking after another. This is the true message of this movie; when Cleo is about to give birth and the grandmother doesn't know her birth date, not even her last name... this struck me hard; those were the tiny messages Cuarón in my humble opinion was trying to convey.",Roma

It gives you an interesting perspective on some social themes that you are probably already fully knowledgeable about but highlights them with a story. But this was not entertaining movie for me. And usually I really like movies like this. It was just not engaging.I think that the real reason it's receiving Oscar buzz is because Netflix is running a $20 million Oscar campaign for it. And, aside from money and acclaim, the reason they think it should be Oscar worthy is because it deals with a lot of important themes, like women's rights and minority rights. And I fully support those themes, but you should win an Oscar because you present those themes in an engaging movie, not just because you made a mediocre movie addressing them. I think that the Netflix campaign hurts the cause because if it wins, people will say it won just because of politics. And I normally don't agree with people who say that but in this case I think they would be right.If there were no Oscar buzz I would say this was a decent movie that addressed a lot of good themes but wasn't necessarily entertaining or engaging. The fact that it's being pushed for an Oscar has actually made me cynical about the Oscars.",Roma
584,alinmihalcea,Why are there so many people bored?,10,5 January 2019,"Main misconception:I don't get most of the people saying this movie - this masterpiece - was boring, that it didn't have any twist or that it's lacking taste or that the characters weren't vivid.I think many people had some expectations from this movie and didn't get them.
They probably wanted some more family drama, someone being murdered or more people dying.
And I just don't get it; it's not a drama unless people die in it? or unless something massively depressing/bad happens?The actual movie review (my review/opinion):Overall it was a very pleasant movie to watch, it didn't feel stupid or dull or boring in any way, everything felt natural and REAL.
That's actually what I liked about it, it was just like a small part, a year of a pretty balanced (financially speaking, but not only) middle-class family, it's so normal and real, everything feels so natural like it's not even a movie, it's almost like a documentary, most of it until the drama kicks in, every time it feels so real, so relatable because it's not some fake, phony movie that shocks you with things you see in most movies (wars, biohazard, breakups, etc.); there are real life problems that are totally relatable in a pretty dramatic setup.
There is life being given and taken away, there are the lives of the main characters that the audience can see, just like a glimpse of them, of their lives, of their emotions, feelings, thoughts.
All the characters are already there when the movie begins and when it ends everything is like 'life goes on'.And the filming, all scenes are so wide and capturing every detail, letting you see everything, there's no hidden things behind it, there are no scenes shown beforehand to give you hints nor scenes that try to confuse you, everything just happens, and the camera is like a silent observer.
Also, very good choice to film everything in black and white, it just makes everything blend in since the action takes place in 70' Mexico City and also since this is a drama, because the lack of color adds to the drama, especially in the most dramatic moments of the movie. It gives it the look of an older movie, a sad atmosphere and it just captures everything that you need to see.It doesn't have to be all in 4K, millions of colors, sound effects, visual effects, stunts, explosions, etc.
It can just have a normal flow, like life itself with it's ups and downs but with a more pale, less colorful, sad but also more classy look to it.",Roma

But Roma is not one of these. It takes its cues from Italian directors De Sica and Fellini more probably than from our own current Hollywood. So, Americans, be advised: Roma does not come to you -- you must go to it. But if you are willing to kick-back, relax, and let yourselves be drawn into the childhood world of writer/director Alfonso Cuarón's 1971 Mexico, in all its political and socioeconomic turmoil, and into the lives of sweetly resilient women who once nurtured and protected him there, you will find your cinematic magic. Let this film wash over you like a warm bath, transfix you, mesmerize you. Demand nothing from it. Expect nothing. I promise you'll emerge with a profound appreciation for life beyond yourself, for the lives of other people, and those many unsung heroes we usually never notice. You'll love your own home more, your own people. In this way we are privileged to experience Alfonso Cuarón's artful masterpiece.

This movie starts with simple slices of life (you laugh in a scene, then another one you get happy, then another one a little bit sad ""just like life""). This makes you think that the movie doesnt have a plot with a structure, but in reality what Cuarón is doing is making you to generate a huge empathy with each character and when the time comes; when the movie gets to its climax....... Ohhhh my goooooood! I can tell you, perhaps in the last five or more years you havent seen something soooo powerul, so moving.

It started with the opening scene of the water being splashed on a floor. I not only found it jarring but interminable. One or two splashes would have sufficed. I lost count after six or seven. I am confused when an ""auteur"" uses a sledgehammer where delicacy and respect for the intelligence of the viewer could suffice.
The film seems to be being touted as an Oscar contender, primarily for the cinematography. I don't get it.Yes, some of the scenes were staged beautifully and the images were well effected, but there was nothing that I had not seen in the fore mentioned Italian movies. The one scene of Sophia Loren holding her child in the middle of the road in ""The Women"" totally encapsulated everything this boring movie was trying to say. Fellini and Antonioni did it all first.
Boring does not equate to art. And the film is endlessly boring without the rewards to be found in deep, meaningful stillness.

601,Cera_co,Visual storytelling at its finest hour,9,12 January 2019,"After Gravity (2013), Alfonso Cuaron went on a long directorial hiatus. The reason is Roma, his newest and probably his best film. Almost every shot transcends from art into real life because of distant camera and lack of choreography on the screen. It's slow but has a great pacing because every extra second pays off in the end. During the watching of the film it's likely you will think to yourself 'I should have ordered pizza and watched new Tom Cruise movie, I can't stand black&white art films and subtitles anymore...' but after the movie ends you will think about it long and hard. You will regret even thinking about Tom Cruise. You will contemplate and you will ask questions. And you will use Google because you probably don't have the slightest idea about political state of Mexico in 1971. Corpus Christi massacre is an interesting read even before you watch the movie. Speaking of which, it's fascinating how all those different themes managed to connect and create seamless narrative. Cleo, who is connection to all the stories, is a maid from a Mexican middle-class family. For most of the screen time she's seen scrubbing dog poo and taking care of children but I would call her the strongest female character of 21st century cinema. Meryl Streep and all her Oscars have nothing on Cleo, modest Mexican maid who we all met in life in some form.

What kept me from giving it a full on 10 were a couple over-the-top scenes... the fire scene on New Years Eve was kind of ridiculous and started getting into the ""genuinely pretentious"" realm, as opposed to what all the ""1/10"" morons deem as pretentious with this film simply because oooh it's in black-and-white and has a lot of long takes so it's instantly written off as ""artsy-fartsy.""I can totally understand how there are plenty of people who will say they wanted to get into this movie, but just couldn't get past the long pacing and cinema verité style of the writing.. and I won't get on anyone's case for feeling that way. And the many people on here who basically said as much and gave it a 5 are very probably worth looking into other reviews because they have displayed that they understand that it wasn't their cup of tea, BUT they also know full well that the other aspects of the movie - really significant aspects - were undeniably FLAWLESS and AMAZING. And that isn't at all something that is nearly as subjective when critiquing film. There are plenty of components to filmmaking that are much more largely NOT a matter of opinion. There is excellent sound engineering and then there isn't. There is amazing cinematography and then there isn't. There is flawless editing and then there isn't.This film has all the technical genius of any film out there. Lighting a black-and-white film is much harder than color.

It's so self- conscious, self- congratulatory and self- important, it's destined to be one of those critics favourites that few people see and/or remember. In tge end it runs for a couple hours, looks good in places, contrived in others and is unlikely to have filmlovers watching and praising it in a decade, unlike A Quiet Place, First Man or Isle of Dogs. Oh, but did I mention, it's IMPORTANT?",Roma

Written by Alfonso Cuarón
Cinematography by Alfonso CuarónRoma is the story of Cleo, the maid of a middle-class family living in Mexico City in the early 1970s.Roma, first and foremost, is a film about the daily life of a maid as she balances her personal and professional lives, and how they drift inextricably together. She loves and cares for a middle-class family on the verge of being torn apart, as their father abandons them to elope, all the while dealing with the disappearance of the man in her own life, who leaves her three months pregnant. This is all balanced against the political strife of the Mexican Dirty War, as students and paramilitary groups battle in the streets, ultimately leading to the Corpus Christi Massacre.This film is almost paradoxical in its drama. We are at once distanced from the characters, literally and emotionally, by Cuarón's gorgeous monochromatic cinematography, while simultaneously drawn closer to them as their comparably unfortunate circumstances slowly unfold.Yalitza Aparicio as Cleo is expertly subtle in her glances, posture, and delivery. She does not say much, but all one must do to access her thoughts and feelings is to simply look at her. She is perfect.Cuarón's camera is always slowly panning, observing everything in its wide 2.39 : 1 aspect ratio. He shoots this almost documentary style, as we are very much observers in the unfolding dramas, and long shots allow us to discern the countless textures and details present in each location. Everyone is shown full-body throughout the film, which is why when Cuarón chooses to shoot a closeup on a character's face, we are suddenly thrust into their headspace, and are called to give pause to the fleeting moment.Each event in Roma feels ephemeral, as we are witnesses to events and times that are coming to their close, even as new ones are beginning. Roma is about the closing of chapters and the inevitable revealing of new ones, and how brokenness sets the stage for rebirth.",Roma

615,thomaseastmand,Roma.,8,16 January 2019,"Quietly and commonly tragic. That's where this film's beauty comes from. However, I would say that there is a degree of cinemanarrative dissonance in that the story being told is one of viscerality, triumph and sorrow but the visual language paints a different picture. Cinematically, the film has beautifully lit shots, masterful camera work and a silky slow pace. It is in this juxtaposition that the film falls short for me. The text and the visuals tell different stories, making the audience feel disconnected from the protagonist. But maybe that disconnection was intentionally done, asking viewers to question their perspective on the everyday tragedy that is so painfully common.",Roma
616,lyandru-tambunan,Slow but still Captivating,8,19 May 2019,"I really don't know why people gave bad reviews to this movie.. Did we really watch the same movie?
I get that the movie is kind of slow paced, and aku little bit boring sometimes, but the story is unique and emotional. At first I was hesitant to watch this movie because of the review, but i decided to give it all try. And I'm so glad I did...
The main character (Cleo) is so on point, and I could feel her pain and emotions. She played this character like this is her actual life. It's amazing..
The story, although not too exciting but still give is a glimpse of a maid life back in the 70's, with a family of her employer, who become like her own family.
All the people involved in this movie deserve an award, and that's just the director or the cinematographer, but the actors, costume designers, and music arranger. Bravo!",Roma

619,maenad-3,I am truly mortified and ashamed that I did not like this film,4,25 January 2019,"After having painfully slogged through this opus of the famous Mexican cinematographer, I hastened to check out the reviews. To my chagrin, the film has been showered with bouquets of lavish praise for the meticulous artistry of the camera, the painstaking attention to detail, the honesty of the actors, the juxtaposition of scenes, the acerbic and incisive social commentary. All that is good and well, but my reaction was of puzzlement and discomfort. Is that the intent of the director? Then he succeeded brilliantly.
From the very onset, I was not happy about the lengthy fascination with the sloshing of water onto the pavement. Peering at the screen, I noted such details as the image of the plane in the reflection. Aha! The minute and the monstrous meet. However, it was a bloody bore. The anarchy of the story line was bearable but not very beguiling. Who were the two young native women? Were they sisters, as they called each other ""manita?"" Who were the children and the women in that large and confusing building? Was that the father who drove up in the large automobile? The relationships were very oblique. Is that how we are to perceive them in our real life?
To the film's credit, the social commentary was interesting enough, with the scenes of the rich set versus the indigenous poor folk during the Christmas celebrations. But who was that person in the costume who sang a song in a language which I could not make out? I did appreciate the reconstruction of the Santa Cruz massacre. The reenactment of Cleo's labour in the very large hospital did capture my full attention in its gripping pathos. However, the whole did not successfully integrate the sum of its parts. Regretfully, I cannot really appreciate Roma as much as the reviewers would want me to.",Roma
620,eseptember,"Great cinematography, no story",3,16 December 2018,"We have been big fans of Cuaron, which was the only reason why we sat through the first hour and a half, in hope for SOMETHING to happen. When it finally did, it was brief and just 'meh'. I respect the director's artistry, but the movie is definitely not for anyone except festival-goers and (pretentious) movie critics. The three stars I rated are for the main actress, who did a great job even though she's not a professional. In short, if you haven't been to Venice, Cannes and Sundance lately, skip this one on Netflix as well.",Roma
621,alejandra-huggins,Better than expected,7,31 January 2019,"I was hesitant to watch Roma based on the reviews that called it a boring film. But when I didn't have anything else to watch, I decided to give it a shot. I was pleasantly surprised. I knew the cinematography was going to be beautifully done but I didn't expect to be so interested in the story. Maybe it's because I'm Mexican or because I can understand Spanish or because I'm familiar with Mexico City. Whatever it was, the movie held on to my attention from start to finish. I really connected with Cleo too. She's a strong woman that kept a brave face through everything she'd been through up until she lost her baby. I enjoyed the connection the children had with her and the realness between Sofia and Cleo.",Roma

624,Muzan03,Roma is not for cinephiles alone,8,22 December 2018,"I watched it alone for the first half. And for the second half, my seven year old niece joined me. So what happened was I told her the gist of the story: that there is a protagonist who is a housekeeper to a family. And because English is not our mother tongue, I translated and simplified most of the conversations in the movie. What I found surprising was she was instantly immersed in the story. (Spoilers) Like she could relate to having a housekeeper, the poops of the dog not swept up at instant, the quarrel among siblings. Two things she could not relate to but I made her understand how sympathetic the situations were were the jerk who made Cleo pregnant but didn't hold himself responsible, and the father in the employing family committing adultery. My niece told me that she would be watching until the last 30 minutes of the movie so she can go to bed and sleep. But by the time the protests occured on screen, she was so tense she bugged me to explain to her what was going on. Then the labor happened. I reminded my niece it was past her bedtime yet she just decided she wanted to finish the movie. The beach scene made her gasp and panic she stifled her scream. By the end of it, I asked her if she liked the movie. She did. She appreciated it all that she asked me if the grandma wore the same clothes everytime and pointed out how the two youngest children were close and attached to Cleo. Really glad my niece wasn't present during that full frontal nudity in the first half.So for those people who are saying that this movie is for cinephiles only because aside from its technical excellence the story is mundane and will bore its viewers, my niece will defend it if she can.",Roma
625,lilianamawer,Dont waste your time,1,28 February 2019,The cinematography is good. But it has a flimsy plot. It's boring. The characters are uninteresting. Its one if the worst films I have ever seen. If only Netflix had spent the 24 million dollars to help the homeless instead of using it to promote this terrible film!,Roma
626,tjwcreations,Not a Day Goes By Not Thinking About ROMA,9,20 February 2019,"Everyday that goes by after seeing Roma, something else comes back to me about the film. It's in the back of my mind, I see it's themes and message reoccur in real life situations or just remember a singular moment of technical brilliance in a film that is as much 100% technical brilliance as it is 100% performance brilliance.Firstly I'll pick out the obvious amazing feats of ROMA, cinematography, amazing, acting, endearing, tender and heartfelt and so believable. The production design is so good you'd be forgiven for thinking that this film was made in 1970 and forgotten about for 40 or so years. The finer details and attention to detail applied here. Everything is exactly how it was and you, the camera, the silent on looker of this time and place.The intimacy of the story is first of all rare for a film to be that confident to show such a story but also extremely impressive at its universal appeal. With this Roma does what the best of film as an art form can do, it can bring us together, it shows humans not as sperate beings, living separate lives, doing separate things but how what we all do, what happens around us, all affects everyone else's lives. While we may think we're living our own life but there's millions of others, other issues and they all weave in and out of each other. The most true thing to real life and yet the hardest thing to protray in film and Roma does it flawlessly.It is as much as a place and time as it is about humanity, as it is about a family, as it about domestic workers, as it about class divides, as it is about masculinity. These are all themes delt with everyday in our lives, in other media but what Roma does with this, how it takes difficult concepts and makes them flesh and blends them together into a beautiful human drama, with mostly none, new or unheard of actors, acting so true to real life your swept up in that atmosphere of it all.The fact Roma even got financed is a great feat. A black and white, slow paced film about a middle class in polictally instable Mexico in the 1970s would seem like it'd never be made. And it's here. Here in a time of self centered, social media crazed frenzies it allows us to take a step back and think about us as people as human beings with relationships and feelings.Now I wasn't raised in Mexico, I never had anyone like Cloe bring me up, it's not that standard in the UK middle class in the 21st century, I found something in Roma, yes the universal message but also the protrayal of family, of the fights between siblings and stories my parents would tell me. If someone else was to watch Roma they'd probably get a completely different and yet 100% personal moment for them. Even down to the little detail of the youngest boy saying ""when I was older"", the acute attention to how kids think and talk in a true representation of the utter genius of this incredible film.This is an incredibly important film and I hope is passed down and considered highly throughout the decades by its ability to defy any accessible barriers, everyone can get something completely personal from Roma and for me that's the true power of cinema.",Roma

630,Levention46,Overrated! Nothing New or Revelatory!,2,31 January 2019,"Clearly the viewer is overawed by the monochromatic, broad sweeping and idyllic cinematography of this vastly overrated film. However, beyond that, the viewer is presented with a cookie cutter story of an upper middle class early 70's era Mexican family complete with servants from a rural Mayan, Zapoteca or Nahuatl village. The middle class children bond with the servants, the mom alternates love and kindness with anger and condescension while the father carries on affair with a mistress. Small plot developments barely warrant attention such as the ever ubiquitous dog poop, the stereotypical boyfriend of the main servant who stupidly bores us with a martial arts stick moves while naked exposing us to his grotesque junk, but abandons her once pregnant. The devout Catholic grandma who tries to help and prays a lot.Nothing is really resolved in the movie other than to present this horribly predictable story that closes with a group hug! The martial arts scenes are a colossal waste of cinematic effort, while the supposedly dramatic swimming in the Gulf of Mexico at Vera Cruz is hyped up solely by the sound editor blasting the volume from very rough seas yet visually presenting - what? 3 foot waves! About the only amusing part is when the family picnics with an American family that likes to shoot guns but only drink cocktails when a forest fire starts. Now that was entertaining!Is this movie Oscar material? Absolutely not! Definitely not even really Worth watching the whole movie. Protesters shooting up with other people? Uhhh....run of what mill 3rd world everyday stuff. The title? Roma? What's the point of that? Later on, one reads that's it's the name of a neighborhood in Mexico D.F. Yet It's more widely known as Italian for Rome or the latest euphemism for Gypsies. Is that even remotely relevant to this cookie cutter story of self-inflicted injustice in a 3rd world country?",Roma
631,susmitad-57232,A film of celebrating life.,10,6 July 2020,""" Existence is nothing but a shared experience of loneliness.""Roma is basically a story about a domestic worker named Liboria ""Libo"" Rodríguez, who looked after the director's family and their home in 1970s Mexico City. "" This is a film about reminiscence, useing of Black and white is according to director is looking at memory.The film is Cuarón's way of ""delivering an artful love letter to the women who raised him."" The story focuses on the crisis and catastrophe of life and how to overcome it. The film is built around situations rather than plot.The story unfolds a journey of a life. This movie reveals the lives of two women, one who is economically wealthy and one who is a domestic worker. Though their life standard is different but however their life story leads to a same direction. this is largely Cleo's story. Here we can see a father: Antonio, who is a doctor. A mother: Sofia, a biochemist. A not working grandmother: Teresa and four children of Sofia.
Cleo is one of two domestic workers, other one is Adela, in an upper middle-class family. She takes care of children, family, cleans the feces of dogs. Sometimes in these early moments, it feels like nothing happens at all. One sweetly realized scene sees the family literally just watch TV. Cleo joins them, maternally cuddling one of the kids and sharing in the simple joy. Everything was perfect in her life but one day outside of her duties, Cleo goes out on dates, falls in love and gets heartbreak. At one point, Sofia, fed up with her now-estranged husband, approaches Cleo and says, ""No matter what they tell you, women: we are always alone."" It's a lesson that Cleo learns after a single date with Fermín (Jorge Antonio Guerrero), a wannabe martial artist. Just as Cleo's life is about to change with an unannounced pregnancy. The family she works for is also going into its own crisis. The doctor Antonio left his family to live with another woman. After That the family sympathizes with Cleo and she continues to work for them and receives good medical care. But trouble ensues when Cleo goes on a shopping trip with Teresa, during a day of student protests; they know that such protests have been violently repressed, but this time the violence is worse than before, and Cleo and Teresa observe it up close. Cleo somehow thinks she is only responsible for her stillborn baby because she always feel guilt for it and never wanted that baby ""I didn't want her to be born"".. But the last scene marks it remarkable where Cleo resolve her conflict unconsciously. She knew that she doesn't know how to swim but somehow she rescued the children with the innate ability. That says if we want to do something we can.
The director used so many symbolization in that film beautifully. Like Water on the floor: The first scene appears he opening shot of water spreading across the garage tiles and it reflects a plane in the sky. Both somehow represents that life goes with the flow, it never stops for anyone. The ocean: a symbol of renewal and change.A scene also shows that the car is too big for the space and later sofia changed that car. Its somehow symbolizes that the life she is leading is not fit for her. Later she exchanged the car and it represents the acceptance of changing.Roma breaks the stereotype and inspires us to perceive our world from different angles.""I think I wanted to understand, to put the pieces together,"" the greatest lesson to be drawn from ""Roma."" We are never alone in our loneliness; with family, we share troubles and persevere. its understanding of the chaos of life, and its unerring respect for those who meet that chaos with love. Roma feels like a celebration of what it means to feel alive.
Roma is constantly reminding us that only certain kinds of people are allowed to externalize their anguish and perform their suffering in public - namely the very young and the very rich. The rest must bear it quietly, invisibly, alone. This is an exceptional movie, powerful and breathtaking, and beautiful.",Roma
632,ysbaiod,Yeah there's a lack of storytelling but it makes sense,10,1 March 2019,"I'm seeing a lot of comments about the lack of story telling and the calmness of the movie but that makes sense. Because it is from the point of view of Cleo, who lives with an upper class family, she is distant from a lot of th apolitical upheaval which is why most of those events are in the background instead of taking center stage.

Through beautiful shot composition that add to a sense of realism, the plot moves like a flowing river. By the end, you will have gasped, laughed, cheered, and maybe cried with our main character Cleo.The film is so well shot and edited. It lingers and moves deliberately, always letting you soak in what it wants to show you. Even when things get tense with the odd natural disaster or near death experience, it never feels like it needs to move faster and get a reaction out of you. Plenty of times I got lost in the scenery and forgot about the characters on the screen. I felt like a trespasser into Cleo's life at times. In a pivotal scene in a movie theater, I started watching the movie the characters are supposed to watch and lost track of the conversation they had and I felt like I was intruding on their business. It felt like I was in the theater with them, sneaking bits if their conversation as if I was eavesdropping on them. To say the least, this film immersed me in its world so well. The sound design is minimal and adds to the realism. With the odd bit of song being sung or being played over the radio, but never as background music. The bare sound adds to the realistic atmosphere created and really lets the film breathe at times.This is a great film and definitely one I'll have to watch again soon.

Scene. in Roma was striking, but particularly those ones where Cuaron just put the camera where he thought best and relied on that spot to capture the scene. It felt like Cuaron was trying to tell us that this is happening all around us, if we'd just stop our flight/plane passing over it we would notice. The hospital scene brought me to the edge of my seat with emotion. The dogs on the wall scene, the forest fire scene, and the mass martial arts training scene (and the few scenes Cleo's journey to find Fermin leading up to the training scene) all stand out as well.

It's good if a movie makes you think like that. Some movies just blow your mind (like Fight Club), and this movie is more calm and slow, even though it provokes emotions too.
I found the following topics/ideas in the movie:
1. Life of the rich vs life of the poor. The family had 4 kids whereas Cleo couldn't have one. That could have been caused by her carrying heavy luggage while pregnant. Yes, she was part of the family, and even saved 2 kids. Still it was their life being lived, not hers.
2. Some things are common regardless of wealth. A man left the wife just like Fermin left Cleo. ""We, women, are always alone, no matter what they tell us"".
3. The revolution scene, especially the moment when women holds a dead body of her man, shows that life goes on. People are born and killed, and that's sad. But regardless of how painful and unfortunate your situation might seem, somebody's love one has been just killed on a street.The movie doesn't have any pathos. It just portrays real life.

That is literally all it is. The movie is beautifully shot, the camera work and angles are a work of art I can totally understand that. However, there literally is no story. It's pretty much about life in the 70s in Mexico. I can understand it is Alfonso Cuaron's biopic of his life as a child living in these times. But not all life stories make for interesting viewing.

I personally found ""Roma"" tedious as well challenging to watch with its subtitles and black and white photography.The cinematography, done by the director himself, was beautiful, however, even if its subject matter was very mundane at times. The background activities were far more interesting than the foreground lives of this 1970s Mexican family and their live in domestic workers.I kept waiting for the story to start and engage me with a compelling narrative - a conflict between protagonists and antagonists - the core features of modern dramatic fiction. Unfortunately, none of these story telling elements could be found.If you were drawn to watch because of the science fiction accomplishments of this director, you will be disappointed.

Cuarón himself was the cinematographer in this project, and he did a phenomenal job. You can't help but have your jaw on the floor the entire runtime. Right from the opening shot I knew I was in for something masterful. Cuarón's signature long takes were ever prevelant here, and each was as masterful as the last.

The film is slow to start and frankly i never caught up too busy reading those subtitles since this is filmed in Spanish and black/white to boot. Now the real story will be when she gets (not wins) that Oscar. There is no acting only repeating her lines. And i can guarantee you SHE WILL BE HANDED OSCAR. Hell im surprised they dont give her a Grammy for her singing Lullabies. She was obviously picked for this roll and to play her part in Illegal Immigration Policys. I have heard she is running for Governor of California (as soon as she learns to speak English and gets her green card) I personally dont like Glenn Close but she is one hell of an actress. And yo think at her age and to have worked as hard as she has she would be willing to give up the chance at Oscar. Which is what she has done. Well she has all the fame and money she needs and needs no more. But WAIT thats not what Socialism and Illegal Immigration is about. Its about 1% of the Population working their asses off so the other 99% can share in their success. I mean just look at the wonderful things OAC has already done for New York. Those 25000 people didnt need those jobs. New York didnt need the millions and millions of revenue created from those jobs. But good OAC sure did show NYC how she thinks the USA should be. She certainly got her point across now didnt she.Next we will see this ""actress"" be handed the Oscar only to have it stripped away because of some stupid law. And who do you think is going to strip it. The same folks that gave it to her. She will be sadly used as a political pawn. Once she gets Oscar taken away the left will go nuts blaming the right.

Nothing innovative is to be found in its themes, neither in its language, nor in its structure, nor in its direction.Furthermore, the acting is sometimes stiff, sometimes overdone, but never - never - convincing.What is left is a magnificent portrayal of an often-told story, a melancholic childhood memory which never becomes a universal tale, and is never characterised enough to acquire sufficient depth and gather enough interest.We, as spectators, simply pass by, admiring the wonderful view from above, attracted yet still quite distant.

I really was willing to give it every chance, even waiting for the tragedy that had Peter Bradshaw crying first time he watched it.The only tragedy with this film is that it is so tedious. The characters are two-dimensional. The plot, such as it is, is OK - it's a kind of everyday miserable life in Latin America if you're not in the posh classes. For servants, it can be rough, although not particularly for the ones in this particular household.Then there's the cinematography. I think someone else has mentioned the panning. It never stops. In the streets, in the house, the camera goes on forever, adding minutes of time that I will never get back, without adding anything to the story.The filming itself is nice and sharp, but that has the odd effect of making it feel consciously like a film set. Just too staged, and not at all that kind of fly on the wall feel you get from some movies that drag you into the characters' minds and lives.There's a sense of impending doom that the plodding plotline can't really pull off. To be honest, the whole movie could have done with a bit more tragedy, and maybe a bit less wooden acting. Yes, I know the one person is not a professional actor, but that doesn't make her acting any good, or believable.I regret watching this. The three stars are mainly because it's an interesting subject, and it does capture a bit of the zeitgeist of the early 1970s. But it could have been much, much better.",Roma

I can not stop thinking on those wonderful persons who gave me so much love. It just transport in time and had a lot of flash-backs about my own life... I guess people who grew in a different culture or another time may struggle to appreciate how genuine and beautiful in its simplicity this film is.

An incidental thread that serves as an excuse for the director to capture on screen an era, a setting, a socio-political climate, textures, an amalgam of memories and a veritable whirlwind of sensations on the surface. A sample of unbeatable cinema, unique and unrepeatable that invites us to observe, judge and remember with its architect a brief passage of its existence with the greatest authenticity; which, in the times that it runs, is something unpayable.",Roma

However one night I had no better choices and decided to give it a try.It's partially true that the plot is weak. But I think that's precisely the point the director wanted to make. Before watching this movie you have to get rid of stereotypes all together, and simply enjoy with an open minded attitude. Because this one is not the well-known formula most of the people like to watch in a movie.It's basically about the life of a maid in the early 70's in Mexico. How she fits into the family, the sort of problems she deals with due to the lack of academic education and common sense, and finally, the way society worked in that time. But yeah, the maid is the main character of the movie.So, for starters, if you don't find anything appealing about knowing how a maid lived in Mexico City 50 years, go do yourself a favor and don't be stupid enough to watch this movie, expecting the adrenaline of the Avengers or such, if you know what I mean.However if you're like me, who happened to live his childhood during that time, then maybe it is worth watching. But you need to understand there is actually no plot. It is basically the introspective of the life of someone, as regular as a maid. Nothing truly amazing about that. She doesn't fight the super bad guys, neither becomes a rock star or a rich software developer. It's 1971, it's Mexico City, and again, it's a maid from Oaxaca, one of the poorest states in Mexico.Overall I could not rate the movie over 8, not because it is not good. It is indeed. But I trend to keep higher ratings for movies that truly make me wonder about something. This one is not the case. But I cried like a baby when I saw this, and probably you will to.Hope this feedback can encourage others or prevent more disappointed ones, depending on your case. Cheers.",Roma

This story about two women at the end of opposite spectrums in terms of social class and life style, struggle with similar life blows - betrayal by loved ones, isolation and fear. What draws you in is the intimacy and simplicity of the camera work and also the plot. Street vendors and dog poo carry larger meaning than usually as they intensify memories of sounds, smells. The film is filled with stills of naturemort scenes, hypnotising the viewer and giving it plenty of time to process the significance of these moments. It's as if viewer is lifted into a children's and the servant's perspective, cutting therefore all the rest of the noise out. The camera work is at times literally as a pause on flashbacks, a meditative reflection.

695,curlyfries-983-327714,A Beautiful Slice of Life-Making the Mundane Extraordinary,7,2 May 2020,"This film is not plot driven. Because it's not plot driven each scene holds the viewer for longer then your usual film. I feel like with most films it's one scene and there's a rush to get to the next, always looking ahead to what's going to happen when the scene is over. This film is different in that it takes it's time for you to get to know and understand it and draw your own conclusions from it. It is a slow burner with no real goal or end point in sight other that just being. And for most people's lives I think that's realistic. From day to day most of what we do is pretty mundane with extraordinary moments thrown into the mix. This film makes the mundane beautiful. From the running of the tap, to the rain tapping on the window to the time consuming chore of turning all the lights off at the end of the day, you feel like you're really there.
This film was really reminiscient of 'The Florida Project', one of my favourites, The acting was really superb and at some points during the film I forgot it was fiction and it was like watching a real life account of someone's life.
I found this film really comforting in many ways. One of the loveliest scenes was when all the family were on the sofa watching a movie and Cleo joined in. There was something really homely and inviting about it which was pretty incredible considering it was black and white. And because it was in black and white it made every other sense heightened. You could hear every background noise, every smell and sense every atmosphere. There were many points throughout the film where I was acually imagining the colours. Lighting also played a really key part too, demonstrating the level of ambience that permeated the film,

But I was greatly disappointed that no theatres showed it the launch week in Calgary (Dec 21, 2018).The story is filled with symbolism an English teacher like me will love. But the extended male nudity will deter much classroom usage.And the plot? Most people crave a problem that worsens before it gets resolved. Many tiny problems here have no development, an opportunity missed in favour of seeming ""realism"". It ends up coming across like a documentary before music and narration have been added.

From the opening to the closing you can see the kind of detail that was put into the steady objective view that Cuarón laces throughout the entire film. The issue here lies within the script. Although I generally enjoy these kinds of character films, I found myself caring very little for the female lead despite her quiet and thoughtful performance. I wish that the kind of care and patience in each shot was translated to the script because it felt like it was dragging at multiple points in the movie. Reluctantly, I watched this movie in four sittings because I found that I cared very little to finish it other than the fact that it will be highly relevant come Oscar season.

Characters are shallow and not explained, unbelievably given how long the duration of the film is. For example, why do the children love one maid over the other? What was the relationship between the mother and her husband before the abrupt and inexplicable (at least to the viewers) abandonment?
Pseudo-feminism cliche: good women (the heart of the family and of the country) vs bad men (they are heartless and destroy everything). Open minded upper-class people, how are large enough to consider maids a true part of the family. In the 70's Mexico. Yeah, right...
Positive aspects of the film: Impressive representation of the 1970 Mexican times. Excellent photography. Many scenes with masterful cinematography (eg the scene at the hospital and that at the sea).Summary: a good movie. No more than that. Very overrated. I was kinda bored watching it...",Roma

710,Inspirationen,"A beautiful film, but not for everyone.",9,12 May 2019,"This is a beautiful movie with a sweet and sad story done in a, to many, unusual style.There are many who don't like it. And that's fair. But that doesn't make it a bad movie. It offers something quite different than Hollywood movies which is a low key story from the common/lower ends of a Latin society. It's not about being pretentious it's about the expectations you have for a movie. If you watch movies for the plot then it likely isn't a movie for you. This is a movie about low key storytelling.It's an acquired taste much like other kinds of culture. Most people who love pop music probably wouldn't like classical music. That's not because it's bad it just doesn't live up to what they except from music. This is the case with this movie. It's not a movie that leaves you contemplating life or a lifechanging experience or a story you just have to dig deeper into, it is just the foundation of what all movies are in a sense: a story. Without all the glamour and extra things we are used to (for example there's no music to emphasise anything anywhere). The dialogue is simple, and we are simply passengers in this little story.We are just so used to movies having the classic disposition of build up point of no return climax etc with main character development or plot moving in one direction but that's not all a movie (or life) is. Sometimes stories are circular and the profound experiences that we do have end up leaving us where we began. Things change but they also don't. Life doesn't always progress forwardly, but it's always moving whether in circles, forwards or backwards.People say it's boring and I think that's wrong. It's not an exciting movie, but it's well done and it isn't boring. I can rarely watch a movie without checking my phone or getting boring but I barely blinked. I found the story to be captivating and beautiful and intriguing. This felt like a real story that could go anywhere. It was not predictable and it was well told. It isn't about that big plot twist or culmination in the end, it's just a movie moving at a slow pace which isn't trying to reach and overarch anywhere.A great and beautiful movie, but atypical and not something you should just put on to watch if you're bored. This movie is specifically not hollow entertainment and it's also not grandiose. It's low key and very simple and in many ways it's a movie without all the ""extra"" stuff which is usually used (elaborate plot, music to emphasise, classical movie split). And ironically it's because this movie is *just* a movie without all the things we're so accustomed to that it's difficult for many people to enjoy. It doesn't meet what people except of movies, but if you let go of your expectations of what a movie is or how it should be and just watch it for what it is, it's a very beautiful movie.",Roma

The length of the memory strings that pull his heart are longer for him than they are for the viewer.The languid pace of the film though conjured up two stories I love: those of novelist John Irving in his contemplative and swirling stories of family and consequence (GARP, THE CIDER HOUSE RULES); and Coppola's ode to Tokyo, LOST IN TRANSLATION. The latter was spruiked by a timeless soundtrack which helped me absorb and appreciate the characters so much. While Cuaron uses some excellent in scene, prac. musical bites (eg YELLOW RIVER and 1970's overplayed MAMY BLUES), the lack of soundtrack extinguished the sense of unity and aural theme (save the concophounous background splatter).ROMA is however incredibly well made and purposeful. The realism is a spectacle. Though I do wonder why it was released in washed out monochrome. My daughter once asked me ""Dad, when you were a kid, could you see in colour too?""

716,mbrandlymolett-53-897035,At Home in Roma,10,8 October 2020,"Roma is a nostalgic film that takes us to a time where architecture and science was the future. Written, directed, (Co)produced, edited, and shot by Alfonso Cuaron in the beautiful Mexico City. Described as a semi autobiographical project, Cuaron handles this project with experimental finesse that reminded me of Kubrick's opening shot of the Shining. The settings quietly tell a story as clear as the dialogue between the characters. Shot in black in white and running just a little bit over two hours, Roma captivates the audience with his usage of space and depth.The opening shot is that of a closeup of the driveway, then there's a slow constant rush of water. The location is still not fully disclosed to the viewer, all you can see is a reflection of the open sky. The shot gave me the feeling of being at the bottom of a well, trapped. Then a plane soars across the sky followed by more and more suds of soap. A beautiful shot of space and reflection. It is also at this time we are introduced to the main character Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio) and the family dog Borras.Cleo and Adela (Nancy Garcia) both live in maids who work for the family. Throughout the film there will be more and more social identifiers that show a separation from the family. I get the feeling there is a Jim Crow type of law in place or maybe a caste system. The family they work for aren't the only family who have live in maids. Cuaron does a beautiful and subtle way of depicting it's normality. After Paco (Carlos Peralta) leaves Pepe (Marco Graf) on the rooftop and Paco and Cleo are staring off into space. The viewer is staring off into the distance of other rooftops of other families who live just as they do.For some reason I find a strong sense of New York City and Tokyo when I look at little details. Sure every city has an alleyway but not every city is known for their rooftops. The art deco structures and designs seen in the movie are beautifully infused with rich Mexican history.The Family, is made up of the mother Sofia (Marina de Tavrina), Dr. Antonio (Fernando Grediaga), Sofia's mother Teresa (Veronica Garcia), the eldest son Tono (Diego Autrey), their middle son Paco, Sofi (Daniela Demesa), and of course little Pepe. Sofia and Dr. Antonio work, however what seems to be a constant strain, and lie, in their relationship is that Antonio has pending business in Quebec.Sofia is a chemist and she grew on me. Her hard exterior is due to her husband's absence and infidelites. There's one scene when Sofia comes downstairs and speaks with Cleo and Pepe before Antonio comes down. She mentions to Cleo he can be late, which I believed referred more to Dr. Antonio than Pepe. He comes down and says one word to Cleo and Sofia gives him the quickest and most disgusted look. It's subtle and fast, because Sofia is clearly not the person to overshare her personal strife with the help. However, by the end of the movie you realize she is a woman of great dignity and value. By leaving a situation she plays a sign of strength to Cleo.When Cleo tells Sofia of her pregnancy with Fermin's (Jorge Guerro) baby, there is a moment I with Cleo feared she would be thrown out. Sofia instead embraces her and even takes her to her doctor appointments. On the way to an appointment Sofia purposefully squeezes Dr. Antonio's car between two vehicles on the road. She waves it off as an honest mistake to the drivers whose cars have been hit, but how else would she get away with it. This car is also a vehicle in the sense as it's something important to Dr. Antonio.Dr. Antonio and his prized car are first introduced in what could be described as a music video from the audience's perspective, but as a wrestler's entrance to the character's in the story. He slowly drives in with his cigarette and oversized luxury car. At one point he stops and adjusts the car and continues down the now narrower alley. Once he parks he exits from the passengers side, an inconvenience that would annoy any person. Once again Cuaron has us examine the smoking doctor. He's clearly going through the stereotypical depictions of a midlife crisis.It is later revealed that along with the shiny new car, Dr. Antonio has a new girlfriend in the city. He is spotted by Tono and Cleo who keep the incident a secret. Dr. Antonio is seen briefly again at the end and when Sofia tells the children she's leaving him, I don't feel bad.The scene where Sofia tells the children she's divorcing Dr. Antonio is an amazing blend of emotion. The kids are sitting around eating ice cream and Sofia breaks the news. Paco takes it the hardest crying, but the rest of the kids take it well. Paco was the middle child until Pepe came around, but he is now the middle male child. It's a coming of age moment for one child and a new bedroom to the other.Though she is not a part of the family Cleo is there to witness it all; from their morning breakfast to Sofia destroying the car after a night of drinking.Cleo and Adela do have personal lives and some freedoms. They are allowed to visit to go to the theater, which is beautifully built and designed. In this era Cuaron also highlights that going to the movies was an experience just as grand as going to a play. Once inside the theater extravagant architecture is shown in the distance and a wide screen. This could possibly be another reason why this film is in black and white, using new forms of depth and space played in the background, movies today are oversaturated and gaudy displays. But we still like it.One person who is constantly present is Teresa, another great player in this ensemble cast. During her trip with Cleo and the driver Ignacio (Andy Cortes), they are beautifully overlayed by soldiers gearing up to take on protesters. Now Cuaron does not really use a digital overlay, as it's not what he wanted to clearly avoid in this project. He simply has the soldiers trucks and equipment shot upstage as the group walks downstage behind them. It's clear that the troops have no quarrel with the middle class, they're focus is on the students. Once inside the crib store it appears the sound of chaos outside is non-diegetic as everyone continues to shop. Suddenly a group burst in and shoot a man in front of the shoppers. The camera pans and we see Fermin pointing a gun at terrified Teresa and Cleo. Fermin and Cleo are frozen in this chaos as he is faced with a decision. Fortunately he decides to take flight and is off to live a dangerous life of violence. Once Fermin flees, Cleo's water breaks.For some strange reason the color of what is supposed to be the amniotic fluids reminded me of B Horror movie blood in black and white setting. I haven researched amniotic fluids but I thought they were clear and it looked like it might've been a pepto bismol pink or orange. Who cares it's in black and white? It's just something that stood out to me amongst my heartbreaking for Cleo. Fermin had already shown signs of possible domestic abuse and psycho-fanaticism.Cleo and the group now must dodge madness and get her to the hospital. A sad moment for Cleo that leaves us hopeful for her. Once at the hospital Cleo is taken to a room as Teresa assists the nurse with what little personal information she knows about her. Once in the examination room, Cleo is transferred to an emergency surgery room. The doctors begin performing surgery and they remove a quiet baby. It is later revealed that the baby is stillborn. Cuaron once again finds beauty in the madness as there is a shot of Cleo's sweating face and it appears the focus is on her breast and then in the distance we see her baby. Who would she be a mother to? Who would she nurse?This is later revealed when Cleo travels with the family in the final family ride in Dr. Antonio's abused prized possession. When Cleo turns her back to take care of one of the other children Paco and Sofi swim and get pulled out by a strong current. Cleo rushes back and reaches and grabs both of the children out of the waves. Once on dry land Sofia returns and Cleo confesses that didn't want the baby to be born. She begin crying and Sofia tells her they lover her, everyone joins in. They all cry together. Once we return the family and Cleo go back to their routines and we are left with almost a reversal of shots showing us that it is time for the viewer to leave. A feeling reminiscent of when Mr. Rogers Neighborhood is about to end. We are then left with the view of the exterior. I'm not sure if it's to allude to passing to another side but the ending is overtly positive. Everyone is ready for a new beginning.This is an excellent film and has elements that different crowds can identify with inside of the film and outside. At times it also feels the fourth wall is blurred and then just like Cleo we are pushed out of the fantasy and into another dream-like sequence, a very controlled dream. For example Professor Zovek plays someone with a cult like following. Perfect role for professional wrestler (Latin Lover) to play. Sofia and Cleo are both strong women who will persevere despite their situations. Finally there's Pepe, the dreamer in all of us and possibly Cuaron. With all the stories he tells, you hope he becomes a great storyteller.",Roma

719,jay_eh,Roma: A Cinematic Wonder,8,18 April 2019,"Simplicity is Art SublimeWhat comes across as striking about this movie is its unparalleled cinematography as well as direction. The real worth of art can probably be realized when it is stripped of its frills and façade. Roma is simplicity personified but that does not stop it from being profound and sophisticated. In a nutshell, Roma is a story of a house help who works for a middle class family with four kids Paco, Toño, Sofi and Pepe,their mother Sofia and father,Antonio,a doctor who falsely claims to go to Quebec for research,leaving behind his family in lurch. The family is at the verge of falling apart albeit Cleo and Sofia are able to eke out a life of their own.One would perhaps attempt to find traces of kitchen-sink realism in this masterpiece but that seems limited only to the trope.Devil is in the detailThe wispy trance-like state that clouds the commonplace for that matter even burnt and broken things is ethereal. For instance, the manner in which the broken jar that was raised as a toast to the new year and Cleo's baby or the man who sings against the backdrop of fire somehow symbolize peace, hope and aplomb even in the eye of storm. Who would have paid attention to minute details like cleaning up dog ordure or the rubbing and scrubbing of floor reinstituting the dignity of menial labour or even exalting it,painstakingly crafted, emanating a sublime aura. It revives many images from the past such as the scene outside the movie palace with balloon sellers crying their wares and the puppeteer's words ""no strings, no tricks"" quite poignant at this juncture as Cleo who has been forsaken by her lover almost resembling the puppet bone man.Reminiscing the turmoil ridden periodSet in 1970s Mexico city, the movie provides oblique glimpses into the period of civil strife and dirty war in the state which resonates at the domestic front too with the severing of relations between the husband and wife, also Cleo and Fermin who professes relentless loyalty towards martial arts but chooses to abandon her the moment he hears about her pregnancy. When all the male figures have fled, one witnesses the germ of new bond which momentarily transgresses the master servant relationship.Critics aver that Cleo hasn't been given much agency,perhaps, Alfonso Cuarón tried keeping Cleo's character closer to the reality,a persona who is gritty yet chooses to not to express much in front of her superiors adhering the norms. Nevertheless, her interactions with the younger lot is unrestrained,especially her tête-á-tête with Pepe.One of the remarkable scenes in the movie is when Cleo is doing laundry and Pepe and Toño are playing a make belief game. Pepe having been shot by his brother refuses to speak as he is dead figuratively.Cleo too becomes a part of this mystic make-belief and says that she likes lying like that possibly letting her inner feelings flow thereby acknowledging that she too likes taking a break. Superficially, it seems to be Cleo's portrait which it indubitably is,herein lies the craft of the maker Alfonso Cuarón whose portrayal of the character is completely contextualized that the line between the character and the context or the content and the form is obfuscated.Alfonso Cuarón's magnum opus is a cinematic legacy for posterity just like Ingmar Bergman's and Satyajit Ray's works, timeless and universal in appeal.",Roma

Its a wonderful experience to watch this movie in black and white with the stunning cinematography. Although, there were hardly any turn or twist in the film, its realistic and linear storyline can leave a long lasting impression to the viewers . The movie is a semi-autobiographical take on the director Alfonso Cuaron's upbringing in Mexico City and he has successfully revived the details of the lifestyle of that time in the movie. Yalitza Aparicio, who played the role of an innocent maid 'Cleo' and Marina de Tavira, who played the role of the wife of a doctor were the main characters of the film and they successfully portrayed their characters.

However, beyond that, the viewer is presented with a cookie cutter story of an upper middle class 60's era Mexican family complete with servants from a rural Mayan, Zapoteca or Nahuatl village. The middle class children bond with the servants, the mom alternates love and kindness with anger and condescension while the father carries on affair with a mistress. Small plot developments barely warrant attention such as the ubiquitous , the stereotypical boyfriend of the main servant who stupidly bores us with a martial arts stick moves while naked and exposing us to his grotesque junk, but abandons her once pregnant. The devout Catholic grandma who tries to help but prays a lot. Nothing is really resolved in the movie other than to present this horribly predictable story that closes with a group hug! The martial arts scenes are a colossal waste of cinematic effort, while the supposedly dramatic swimming in the Gulf of Mexico at Vera Cruz is hyped up solely by the sound editor blasting the volume from very rough seas yet visually presenting - what? 3 foot waves! About the only amusing part is when the family picnics with an American family that likes to shoot guns but only drink cocktails when a forest fire starts.

737,anantaakotal,True piece of cinematic marvel,9,8 February 2019,"Quiet in its tone and subdued in its essence, Roma slowly creeps into the audience's consciousness and tells us a story of human fortitude that has not been exaggerated for cinematic flair. Roma is a deeply personal movie. The story being too familiar, nothing in the movie surprises you. But with an elaborate cinematography and slow camera movements, the movie is able to shine the light on moments that we would not have otherwise paused to reflect on. In its idleness, the movie reveals the complexities of human character and and its ability to rally against unforeseen circumstances. It is a story of hope and courage.
The movie is filled with metaphors. There are so many scenes that deserve an essay of their own. However, I feel its best if I were not to betray these details, before you could watch and form your own reflections. A lot of the movie feels more like a poetry. The black and white theme certainly helps build that feeling.

Alfonso Cuarón has done it again.,10,22 December 2018,"Alfonso Cuarón packs his unique style into arguably one of the decades most beautiful films. His signature long shots are absolutely stunning, and if you've seen any of his other films (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Gravity, Y Tu Mamá También) you'll notice that he adds every bit of his style Cuarón from visual symbolism and imagery, to complex takes.There is so much in this movie to unpack, like the rich history of Mexico and it's politics during Echeverría's presidency, to a very common household and the relationship between employee and employer. The film talks through it's imagery, containing themes of family, love, abandonment and so much more.I don't want to say any spoilers, but the scene in the beach near the end of the movie is one of the most beautiful and complex takes I have ever seen in any movie. Hats off to Cuarón for making such an incredible piece of art, and hopefully it gets the recognition and praise it deserves.",Roma

Cuaron's directing is so precise and the camera work is impressive beyond belief. There were multiple scenes where I asked, ""How was this even made?"" or scenes where I watched in awe. The narrative was also super engaging and brought up some many complex, emotional themes. It had me in tears at multiple points of the film. The tone and pacing of the film was a high point as well. The constant tone shifts resembled a sense of reality as did the struggles. The complex political themes were subtle enough to not get in the way, but poignant enough to stick with me way after watching the film. The audio design was also incredible, and I recommend watching this with the best sound possible. Overall, I expected great film making more than a compelling narrative, but I got easily received both. Cuaron's style is a personal favorite of mine, and his interesting and fresh style of film making is present in this film as well.",Roma
766,dlepesova,An explanation as to why critiques may like this film,8,27 April 2019,"This was a very atmospheric experience with undoubtedly skilled cinematography. In particular, it was clear that the camera took advantage of the spacious scenery. The panning technique was used effectively with wider shots and the length of most shots fitted the tone overall. The acting was REALLY well done, even the child actors did not disappoint. The use of the black and white filter automatically made the whole experience even more depressing than it should be, which is actually what I believe the film aimed to do. The good thing tha came out from this choice of filter is the fact that it didn't take away from the beauty of the film. There were still amazing still frame shots and scenery, proving that colour is not at all necessary for a good cinematographic experience, with every detail still clear and concise and the different shades still accounting for the different colours. It is clear that Cuaron took a massive amount of time and effort even in the filter, making sure the details in the film are still seen without a problem. You could only imagine how much effort went into this piece. The first half of the movie took me a while to get into (not sure whether or not it's because I was not in the right mindset for this type of film). I usually prefer movies that are a bit more fast paced than this, so I would prefer if the first half was a little shorter, but I understand the artistic choice of going at the pace this movie is set as characters had to be developed to establish a connection between them and the viewer for later, more emotional scenes. The second half however, took me by surprise. I felt like I was embraced by the movie, standing alongside with other characters during the scene where they shopped for a crib. The fact that such an innocent and pure activity could turn into a mass attack really shocked me. I don't usually get too emotional out of shock to the point of tears, but something about the birth scene got to me. Maybe it's something about having a side view of the baby literally dying in front of it's mother while being blurred in the background. Safe to say, second part of the movie was much much better, with the plot resolving and themes coming together. The end scene at the beach was very powerful too, and it's even more impressive knowing that it was shot in one take. I'm new to analysing movies, so maybe I did not see the point in some scenes that I found out flat out boring and unnecessary, but I could say with confidence that this movie deserved to win best cinematography as it used simple techniques (which fit very well with the setting) to explore and be creative with the space given.I would watch this again and maybe I will understand more of it and give it at least 9 stars. But that's what I look for in a movie, to make me think and raise questions after watching.",Roma
767,joeltryon-40739,2 hour long walking and talking commercial,1,3 April 2019,"This is by far the movie that has frustrated me the most. A movie is supposed to be digital storytelling, I repeat STORYtelling. If a movie has no plot and no direction then what is the point other than if you enjoy watching people walk around and talk senselessly for hours in black and white. Yes it's pretty and the cinematography is more than there, but that's not what you rely on to create a movie, especially when that's all that's there.

It was visually stunning and I felt like I was apart of this world, a spectator simply observing, which is what you want in film, you want it to feel real. In almost every scene there is a story being told in the background and foreground. The story was told from the point of view of Cleo, one of two domestic workers helping Antonio and Sofia take care of their 4 children. Problems arises when Antonio leaves Sofia and the family and runs away with another woman. Cleo got pregnant and had miscarriage. The story brings up the whole theme of acceptance and challenges of single parenthood as we see Sofia struggle to raise the 4 children. The production was so well done and really shows you what life was like in 1970s Mexico. Overall this movie was a great watch and visually pleasing.

771,chickenwingsandhotsauce,"Loneliness, Belonging & Family",8,14 February 2020,"Alfonzo Cuarón delivers a meloncholy yet beautiful journey through 1970s La Roma, Mexico in this picturesque and eerily realistic story of loneliness and belonging.Yalitza Aparicio stars as Cleo, the quiet, caring house keeper for a wealthy family headed by the matriarch Sofia (Marina De Tavira). We follow the family- and Cleo- through the excitement and dangers of living in such a bustling and lively city, as well as the emotional attachments we as humans develop for one another. It questions what we conceive as 'family' and how we cope with sadness and stress.Cuarón orchestrates a huge cast of extras and breathes life into Roma, so much so you forget you are watching a film and instead get drawn into a perfect amalgamation of choreography and the documenting of a family routine.The cinematography and sound editing are breathtaking. The black and white, sweeping camera shots and central framing of scenes bring a calmness to the madness, which in turn exentuates the subtle performances of all the main cast and make you feel like you are part of this living, breathing world.Newcomer Yalitza brings her character to life with a subtlety and realism that makes you connect with her story from the word go. Whilst avoiding spoilers- her quest for love and being a part of 'something more' goes through many peaks and troughs. Characters she considered close are unable to remember her name or age and are left abondoning her during her most vulnerable moments. The performance from Yalitza (and the four child actors) take you on an emotional rollercoaster, leaving you with questions like: ""can Cleo realise who her real family are?"" and ""who in her life genuinely cares for her?"" . It's down to Cleo to find that ""perfect balance"" in her life that she doesn't know she is capable of possessing.The only issue for me was the pacing of the movie. In some areas the movie dragged and became a bit mundane and monotonous (I now realise that this probably symbolises the life our characters are leading- but it still felt a little too slow in areas). The phrase style over substance came to mind many times, but with the crescendo of emotional tension during the film's climax, it builds to an incredie final act that may leave you wanting more.With beautiful metaphor (a car not being the ""right fit"" for the garage and the frequent planes signalling a ""daydream"" like life that always seems too far to reach) the film tugs on the heart strings, makes you fall in love with the main characters and takes you back to a hectic childhood in Mexico that you never had. Cuarón delivers and I highly recommend you watch this film on Netflix right now!8.5/10",Roma
772,cariss1,Fellini + Herzog + Jodorowsky + Hispanic soap-opera = Roma,5,15 December 2018,"The implication of that title may make you think Roma is one hell of a movie.
It's not.The critics had me looking forward to this movie more than any other in recent memory.
An artistic film with both both style AND substance they said. Just what I like.I was captivated by the opening sequence, the movie had my undivided attention.
I watch intently waiting to witness the magic of cinematic genius unfolding before me.
I wait and watch. Wait and watch.
An hour passes and I feel like there's something I'm failing to grasp.
Another 30 minutes pass and I really hope I haven't wasted my time.
Another 30 minutes go by and the movie is drawing to a close and I am dissapointed.
The movie ends and I feel swindled, conned, duped.
The critics have done it again!Not to compose a total hatchet job i'd like to point out that the sound design throughout was exceptional with the Dolby Atmos soundscape using directional sound to it's full potential, immersing me in the setting portrayed on screen.
I imagine the movie also did a good job of representing the era and location with authenticity.Now for the hatchet job:
I take exception to the critics assertions that every scene is beautiful because they're just not. One imdb user review even told me my Jaw would be on the floor throughout.
Truth is, most scenes are just functional, framed just as they should be with the choice to present the movie in B&W imbueing the scenes with a gravitas that wouldn't be present if it was in full colour.There are 3 or 4 scenes throughout the entire movie that stood out as being visually unique in their beauty and 2 or 3 others that fell too far into pretentiousness to fully appreciate their artistic merit.The themes of life, death, family and the human condition are always good fodder for a thoughtful drama but when the characters are lacking personality, the script is sparse and the story is threadbare it is very difficult for the viewer to care.
Even the intended climatic scenes are anti-climatic and fall flat.Personally, I found this movie lacking in both style and substance.But what about the symbolism and hidden
meanings you say? In this case, convenient devices to to make a dull movie appear deeper than it is.
I'm sure it's all very personal and meaningful for Cuaron but then he has tangible experiences to flesh out the bones of this story.Ultimately, I feel this was an exercise in mundane authenticity punctuated by just enough plot to keep the viewer interested in the hope that it gets better.

The diff between cinema & painting gallery is screenplay. Roma completly has no screenplay and no character. Cinema is not a box that you put every subject(content) to it. You can put one or two things to it and try to zoom on those subjects. Simple & deep. Roma taste nothing. Its not about being mother, its not about killing students, its not about divorce, its not about misery, its not about district Roma, its not about oppressed women. Roma is about nothing. History of Cuaron's family maid is NOT dramatic & not important for others.
Alfonso cuaron is a smart guy who has deceived critics all over the world.",Roma

And just when you think ""wow, this panning has been so great and so abundant, they can't possibly squeeze in any more!"" well, right at that moment you're in for a treat. No spoilers, you will need to see for yourself what treat I mean. Oh, there's also a story in there somewhere about a middle class family in the Mexico in the 70s, marital problems and a Mixtec indigenous live-in household help.

Yalitza Aparicio gives a performance that is probably one of the best I'll ever have the privelege to witness. No hyperbole; just flat fact.

Despite the ""intellectual"" wave that surrounds it, and being exposed to be marked as ignorant, talking honestly it has a very poor script, it is full of extremely long scenes, and all of which combined makes the most boring and endless movie you could ever see.
The plot could have been reduced to a totally worthy 15-minute short film, which would be much more adorable and viewable.

793,Rharney6,There are two kinds of movies. Roma is the epitome of the second.,9,31 December 2018,"Both types are perfectly legitimate and I love both.First: movies as entertainment. A place to lose oneself. I just saw all three of the Lord of the Rings movies here in a theater in Minneapolis over New Year's Eve weekend, 2018. Back to back. To see them again on a big screen was wonderful and I appreciated, all over again, how Peter Jackson (the director), combined so many elements (story adaptation, casting, acting, visuals, special effects) to create a world I was happy to lose myself in, for hours. (Trust me it was hours.) When they're good we all love movies like this. I know I do.Second: movies as an experience or lesson. A place to find oneself. Most of David Lynch's films fall here. A fair amount of Bergman. Some Kubrick (2001 for sure; maybe Barry Lyndon). Lost in Translation. And Roma. Really any movie where the user reviews on IMDB are either 8-9-10 or 1-2-3. And the latter are filled with words like ""boring"" and ""nothing happens.""A suggestion if you're in the latter group: stop trying to figure these movies out. Stop waiting for something classically entertaining to happen. Just turn off your brain and stop thinking. Let the movie roll over you (frankly this is the only way to watch a Lynch movie that isn't ""The Straight Story"" or ""Dune""). Be open and emphatic.When it's over you may find yourself with some subtle, emotional reaction you can't obviously describe (unlike a response to the first kind where typically we know exactly what we liked and didn't like). But you feel moved in someway: sad, filled with joy, terrified. These movies can expose you to or remind us what it means, authentically, to be human. And that kind of movie won't leave you for a long, long time.This isn't to say that some who love the second type can't be pretentious. I roll my eyes at lots of these user reviews sometimes. Ignore them. Find your own way.Think of it this way: loving both kinds of movies just gives you more movies to see and enjoy!",Roma

Although at first the movie is slow and random, you can see it is building the characters around Cleo, the main character in the film, and you end up completely immersed in their life and caught up on their struggles, it's difficult to avoid feeling something.The detail in each scene is completely overhwelming, as a Mexican you can see how old logos, places and products where reproduced just as seen in the 70s.A small glimpse to an ordinary life full of sorrow and joy, fear and peace. It's a close inspection of the human condition, life at its purest form.

The reason (some) critics give this film such gushing reviews is beyond the average movie-goer. I saw the reviews and gave it a shot. With those high praises, I thought, it MUST be good.
Wrong.
So I looked closer at the reviews to see what I may have missed. From the critics: ""ongoing restraint,"" ""lucid detail of a formative memory,"" ""densely realized,"" ""filmmaking as gesture,"" ""it can almost feel prurient,"" and the like. If language like that doesn't turn you off then this movie might be for you. And congratulations, you are the most sophisticated, and sublimely profound person in every room. But you already know that.
The Fellini references are spot on, in the sense that a great movie/story can sometimes be ""not about where you are going, but what happens along the way."" And by that standard Roma falls flat.

806,Kugelausholz,A movie for (almost?) everyone,10,16 December 2018,"Apparently there´s a lot of things people agree on. Cinematography, acting, setting. All great. But some IMDb users voiced that it has no story and is a movie for snobs. But is it really?I don´t think so. We follow a young maid who is struggling with her place in society. She loves the kids, is usually not treated that bad, but still, she is their maid and doesn´t have her ""own"" family. She also likes a guy, but doesn't quite seem to be in love. She generally seems unsure about her future. Meanwhile the family she works for struggles itself, as the father spends less and less time at home. These two story arcs intertwine while being set in front of historical events in Mexico.So prepare for some dramatic scenes, some heavy tragedies. Maybe even bring a tissue. You really feel for all characters at the end of the movie, but without it being cheesy, tearjerky or being forced down your throat. Sure, Roma doesn´t follow a tradional storytelling-formula, but how is that a problem?
If that´s not a captivating and emotional story, I don´t know what is.It took me some time to get fully involved with the story and the black and white made some interior shots just a little too grey, confusing and too much to digest.But yeah, since that was my only complaint, that´s as close as its gets to a 10.

And yes, the single sweeping camera take does not fail to impress me.The film has the picturesque quality and emotional sensitivity of A Little Princess (one of my fave books adapted to screen), Gravity (got him an Oscar) & Children of Men (an apocalyptic dramatic masterpiece), movies he directed that left indelible impression to me.Bravo!",Roma
809,maxfkeller,Roma: The Best Movie of the Year,9,10 December 2018,"I have been waiting a long time this year for a movie to truly grab me. I worried that I was being a bit too cynical since there were two movies this year I loved and most of the movies I enjoyed were films I wasn't aure whether or not they were that great. I went into Roma hoping for something remarkable yet tried not to get too hyped. Alfonso Cuarón has made one of my favorite films of all time, Children of Men, and though the only movies I've seen from him were Gravity and his entry in the Harry Potter franchise, he is someone I'd call one of the best directors working today. Once I saw Roma, my love for Cuarón grew.One of the most famous aspects of Cuarón's directing is his use of long takes and in this film, he takes this understanding and gives it a different approach. Many of the shots in this movie are longer than your average shot length yet it never draws attention to it. The way Cuarón handles framing and shot composition creates such a grand environment for something as simple as two people running down the street. In fact the longest takes in the movie are those that seem the smallest in terms of scale but larger in its emotion.Cuarón's attention towards the visual aspect of cinema isn't limited to his cinematography as well as the script. There is very limited dialogue throughout the film, just short sentences yet these sentences say so much about the character's emotion. Sometimes a scene will take place where you feel the character's emotions even if they say nothing. Cuarón understands that this film is a small story and focuses on the lifestyle of these people and it captivates you not with the events but the struggles that the characters deal with.Concerning the lifestyle, this may be odd but one aspect that helps draw you into the world of Roma is its sound design. This director is well aware of the locations as well as the distance between the subject and the camera. A great example of this are moments where a marching band is seen in the streets and instead of playing music and having the audio be the same throughout, he waits until it comes a bit closer to the camera and increases it by a small amount. I could be overanalyzing this but its small details like this that just transport you inside the film's setting.I'm aware that this film will be released on Netflix some time soon and I'm happy because it gives more people an oppurtunity to watch it but at the same time, it's a film that needs to be seen in the theater. It spends so much time with this family as you start to feel for them and on the small screen, it can still be appreciated but in a theater, it becomes an experience.",Roma
810,ckkoay-839-186567,"Beautiful movie that is funny, captivating and heart wrenching",10,1 February 2019,"I honestly didn't expect Roma to be so good. Having read about the number of nominations (as well as the fact that the film was shot in Black and White), I expected an ""arty-farty"" self-serving pretentious film from Alfonso Cuarón who had gotten (well deserved) kudos for the breakout Clooney-Bullock film, Gravity. Boy, was I ever so wrong!Roma is an emotional and poignant movie about Cleo (played very believably by Yalitza Aparicio), a maid working in an upper middle class Mexican home in the early 70's against the backdrop of social upheaval. We see life through her innocent eyes as she navigates through the day picking up after the four children in the household, doing the laundry, serving food and washing the dog poo laden garage floor tiles.The movie has been described as ""achingly"" beautiful and I understand why now. This is a movie with an abundance of heart and honesty. Of course, the movie features a talented cast who did a wonderful job of non-acting acting that gives this movie such a raw and natural feel to it. Alfonso Cuarón's direction and photography melds so well together that this movie flows organically with not a single frame of waste to it.A critical and technical masterpiece not to be missed.",Roma

I'm a movie snob and love long-drawn, lingering shots, but I also appreciate a movie for, well, having a plot and I cannot fathom why people are praising this movie to such high levels. So it comes off as pretentious instead.
It is quite possible to do a movie with a sense of ""every day"" or ""regular life"" feel and it still have a plot. This movie simply didn't show me anything of consequence, beyond having references to a very troubled time of Mexican history. There is a lot of social commentary, but this isn't explored well enough as the story arch does not show an overall red thread, when there really is no plot that serves to show us anything.

By Chase M
Not only is Roma (2018) Alfonso Cuarnó's most personal work, it's also his best. The film grabs you from the first frame, and doesn't let you go until the end of its 2:15 run time. Cuarón's mastery of the camera is evident in scene. Every shot contains so much painstaking detail; you can't help but feel the passion and commitment that went into this project.
Roma, is the story of Cleo who works as a maid for a middle class family in the 1970s. The film documents a year in her life.
Before I discuss anything else, let me heap more praise onto what Cuarón did. To take these childhood experiences, and recreate them in such a loving way is something truly special. The writing in this film is simple yet moving. The film really made me care about, and connect with the character of Cleo. Cuarón's cinematography is something to marvel at as well. Each shot is beautifully presented, and the lighting is top notch all the way through. I could go on about how great the camera work is, but I won't. Just know it's something special and go experience it.
The performances are all strong. Particularly those of Cleo and Sofía, played by Yalitza Aparicio and Marina de Tavira. Both embody the strong female figures that become the focus of the film. Aparicio as a first time actress is particularly impressive, she delivers a powerful performance full of emotion. The acting nominations for these two, were well deserved.
Roma is a masterpiece. It is the culmination of all the work Alfonso Cuarón has put in throughout his career. I was skeptical going in (mostly due to the fact that it's a Netflix movie) but I loved every second of it. This movie is a victory for foreign film makers everywhere. It's a shame the Academy didn't pick Roma as 'best picture', because it deserved it more than any of the other nominees. Regardless, Roma is exceptional in every sense of the word and deserves to be experienced by anyone who appreciates the art of cinema.10/10",Roma

852,PabloPvM,"Good cinematography, lack of story",6,24 July 2019,"Roma is a movie which takes place in 70s México, where the protagonist, Cleo, works at a family's house as their maid, doing the housework and frequently dealing with the four kids of the family.The movie has a very long start, which already gives away how the director is going to approach this story. The cinematography of this movie is fantastic (minus sometimes where they push it a bit too much), giving each scene a literal 360° view and letting the spectator choose in what aspect they want to focus on. Maybe you want to focus on Cleo as she does her work, or maybe you want to watch how the kids are playing, or maybe you decide to contemplate the outstanding work they did with the setting of each scene. It is really something unique, and I believe, the rich part of this movie.And that's another thing, the scene's setting and ambience. It's so well crafted to give that feel of a 70s, vintage México. They really did a good job on this aspect.But the problem is that... That's about it. The story is not something I'd put in a movie, because, simply, there barely is one. It's basically Cleo working, getting pregnant, while Sofia, the housewife, deals with his cheater husband. It doesn't have anything special.I tried to connect with this story. I tried to dive in, and enjoy it, but it was so difficult, that I kind of gave up. I'm not saying it was rubbish, but it lacked so many things.
The cinematography is phenomenal, but you can't make a whole movie out of only that. I can't help but feel that this looks and sounds more like an audiovisual project than a movie.I understand what Cuarón wanted to achieve with this, and I respect it, but I don't think that this was the best way to do so.
Nevertheless, the approach given to this movie isn't something that you see everyday, so it's still unique in that aspect.",Roma

It must be good!""Wrong.",Roma
856,ccsbuilder,Figured out why the positive reviews and nominations,1,29 January 2019,"From the incredibly slow opening scene to the final credits I kept asking myself, ""How in earth did this B movie get so many nominations and positive reviews??!"" Then it hit me...it is because it is fashionable to portray men as misogynistic, self-absorbed beasts who abandon their families and responsibilities (so ladies stick together, per the line from the mom). The applause of the reviewers is nothing more than pandering to the current fashionable narrative coming out of Hollywood and the main stream media. Ultimately; however, these very same writers who gushed euphemistic reviews, will loose credibility with ticket buyers (where it really counts) and the ratings of the award shows will sink even lower.

I gave this film a 7 strictly for two reasons. 1) good cinematography. and 2) The two parts where anything actually happened, it was so disturbing and cringe worthy, it was almost hard to look away from the screen.The depiction of this family was boring for the most part. The parts depicting the hardships of the family however, were very immense and intense. I have no reason not to believe these things happen to families in Mexico, in the 70s, which is why that area of the picture was good. This was also the same reason the film deserves a 7/10.",Roma

I kept checking the watch, was not able to identify with the main character, felt no emotion, no compassion, nothing at all except for the overwhelming feeling of boredom. I guess my dog was much more interested in the movie which proves that they can see the world in black and white.
Sure, the cinematography was beautiful but that is about all. I have no idea what the point of the movie was. Hatred towards men?
I also don't believe that a normal woman could show so little emotion when losing a boyfriend, baby and - above all- fighting for lives of the kids that were in danger of getting drowned. Is she a doll or a machine?

862,nil000,Experience Cinema,9,14 January 2019,"Watching cinema is a conflicting experience. We all have a rational self, looking for the values that we can think long after the movie ends and that we can share with our friends. We also have an experience self, striving to live in the moment and feel what the characters feel or creators might want to suggest. While the rational self looks for causality and rules, trying to extract the essence, the experience self is ignoring all rules and essence, trying to get it all in.
A movie to be enjoyable, needs to solicit a harmonious interplay of both selves. And a typical good movie makes us care about the characters in order to follow the story. Usually the balance is tipping greatly towards the story to comfort the rational self. A more artistic movie will challenge us to give up some of our need for rationality while rewarding us with more intuitive truths. This may feel uncomfortable, and only the better ones will succeed in finding a new harmonious balance. Citizen Kane is an example of such movies. Films that make us relinquish (almost) completely the rationalism for the sake of experience are extremely rare. Most of the people feel frustration and discomfort doing so, so the rewards in feeling these experiences must be very high to rebalance the two selves harmoniously. How they do it, is pure genius. Code Inconnu is an example of such movies.
Michelangelo Antonioni (Red Desert), Jacques Tati (Playtime), Andrey Tarkovsky (Stalker), Michael Haneke (Code Inconnu) are among those geniuses that got closest to experience cinema. And now, Alphonso Cuarón with his Roma.

As a filmmaker, it was very hard to watch without simply marvelling at the sheer technical prowess of it and I spent most of the film wondering 'how the heck did he/they do that?' which may have detracted from the emotional impact of the film. Scenes that come to mind are the riot out of the window and the rescue from the waves. The birth scene is another example. But having had time to process the film, I just don't feel it had the emotional impact it should have done; I felt too separated from the human drama and there is something detached and almost voyeuristic about the way it has been shot, despite the fact that the performances are essentially flawless and entirely believable - an amazing achievement in itself. Many films have made me cry and this should have been one of them but it didn't emotionally land with me, and without that sense of connection with the characters, I'm left wondering how effective it is as a piece of cinema. It's an exquisite piece of filmmaking by a master practitioner, but it didn't affect me anywhere near as much as I wanted it to.",Roma

880,adam-61825,Of the finest achievements of film in the 21st Century.,10,9 July 2020,"The film opens on a stationary shot, a bird's eye view of cascades of soapy water washing over a stone-tiled drive-way. It is not until over three minutes of the same shot -- interrupted only by the reflection of an overhead aeroplane that makes its way across the surface of the water -- that the camera slowly tilts upward to introduce us to Cleo, the live-in housekeeper of a middle-class Mexican family. But it is within these first couple of minutes, before any characters are shown, that the essence of the film is encapsulated: it is a quiet piece that captures the simple and mundane aspects of life in a way that enthralls the audience for its full 135-minute runtime. Although it defies many filmmaking conventions, the film feels familiar and effortless. In some ways, it is an epic without the conventional narrative structure of conflict and resolution. Drawing on many of the characteristics of traditional drama, the film's emotional palette touches on a whole range of feelings with moments of comedy, tragedy and everything in between. Roma is a visually arresting and exceptionally powerful masterpiece that, two years later, still feels rightfully deserving of all the praise and accolades it has received, and then some.Written, directed, produced and edited by Alfonso Cuarón, Roma is a semi-autobiographical film which paints a vivid and visceral portrait of Mexico City in the 1970s, taking place in the Colonia Roma neighbourhood where Cuarón himself grew up. One of the most striking and memorable elements of the film that anyone will recognise upon first viewing is its refreshing use of monochrome. However, there is more to the black-and-white nature of the film than meets the eye. Originally shot in colour, a monochrome filter was applied in post-production and the tonal values were adjusted to create a more crisp and ambient image. Personally, this serves as a constant reminder that Roma is a historical piece interlaced with memories drawn from the director's own childhood experiences. In addition, the use of 65mm film gives a rich and detailed quality that only adds to the compelling realism of the film as we witness Mexico from the perspective of an ordinary working-class woman.Roma is equally a masterclass in cinematography that can be enjoyed by everyone from the casual viewer to the aspirational film student. Abandoning his recurring collaborator Emmanuel Lubezki, Cuarón takes on the role of director of photography for this deeply personal project. The shots are lush, exquisitely choreographed and if you were to choose any frame from the film, print it out and frame it, you would likely end up with a delightful work of art to hang up in your living room. Notably, the film primarily employs long shots that keeps us at a distance from the characters but close enough to feel immersed into the lives of the characters. There are great examples of horizontal panning in interior shots that follow Cleo as she walks through the house, tidying up the rooms and switching off the lights at the end of the day. Meanwhile, tracking shots are used as the characters weave through bustling streets, which feel alive and genuine thanks to the spectacular sound production. Roma features no official soundtrack, with the viewer only hearing what the characters can also hear: the usual busy chatter of the urban population, drivers honking their horns in the congested traffic, snippets of radio music played in the background. All of this produces an authentic representation of Mexico as remembered by Cuarón.Yalitza Aparicio in not only her acting debut but a leading role shows great promise with a convincing and understated performance that is profoundly moving but never excessive. Similarly, impressive performances are given by the established actress Marina de Tavira as Sofia, the mother of the family. Thankfully (and crucially) the child actors in the film are well cast, which is too often an uncommon occurrence in many films featuring children. As a result, Roma is able to consistently engage the audience with natural dialogue and steady pacing. Overall, Roma succeeds in expressing an artistic vision with subtle motifs such as water, planes and cars cropping up throughout to contribute to thematic undercurrents. Significantly, we can derive interpretations of visual symbols from the film but these never come across as heavy-handed; instead, they are objects and devices in the background of the film that are astutely implemented into the set design to spark intellectual discussion over what ideas might be expressed regarding themes such as childhood, gender roles and social class.Roma may be distinct from previous works in Cuarón's filmography which includes the critically acclaimed space thriller Gravity and the gritty dystopian sci-fi Children of Men, but all of his films feature one common thread: his works are all an illustration of the human experience. Roma is but a small segment of history with an ambiguous, neither-happy-nor-sad ending that shows that the world continues to turn, that each and every one of us is living a uniquely complex life occupied by ambitions and dreams, fears and impulses, triumphs and disasters. Undoubtedly, this is his magnum opus and leaves cinephiles and critics alike eagerly awaiting Cuarón's next release. Ultimately, what we have here is a rare and unforgettable slice-of-life drama which confirms that Cuarón is a master of his craft and, when considered as a sum of its parts, Roma stands as one of the finest achievements of film in the 21st Century.",Roma

Echevarria the President was a kind of Diaz Ordaz lite, who had ordered the 1968 Tlatelolco massacre of students during that Olympic Year. The actress Aparicio was born for the role she played so convincingly, and the hospital's doctors and nurses were most extraordinary in their performance of a stressed major city facility.

At some point art becomes a goal in itself, and that is the point where it should be left to the author HIMSELF to look at it, admire it, dissect it, whatever... but not to the audience.What this movie is NOT is a piece of art for a purpose, WITH a purpose.Snobistic, decorative, pretencious, infinitely unimportant, piece of indulgency is what it maybe is.

891,racerx525,Brilliant Storytelling. Dismiss the Dimwits.,9,24 January 2019,"I started ROMA a month ago, and dropped it in the first five minutes. It broke movie rule #1 - hook me with a compelling teaser immediately to justify the next two hours.
After watching the attention it got at the Golden Globes I decided to give it a second shot.
It made a mess of me.The beauty of Roma's story is it's utter lack of explosions, fire fights, and gratuitous breastage. It drops our guard, making the combination of bourgeoisie life, thinly sheltered from 3rd world life, and challenges addressed in nuance, gut wrenching. The film provides regular tropes, and addressed them in ways that betrayed my suspension of disbelief expectations over and over, until the final vignette had me climbing my chair and bawling in anxiety. But it wasn't the only scene that accomplished that. Cuaròn's cinematography slow burns, and builds with little fanfare that creeps under your skin without your permission.
It's gorgeous, raw, humanist storytelling. The best thing I've seen all year.",Roma

A very hackneyed story, absolutely emotionless with respect to feeling anything about the characters, distant and cool in projection and a relentlessly boring story with zero entertainment value.Now the other film with 10 Oscar nods, The Favourite, while not likely to be widely popular either, had an excellent plot acted by hugely inspired performances of the three female leads. The thrust, feint and parry of their power stuggle to win the favour of a befuddled Queen was truly magnificent. Deserves all its nominations. In contrast Roma is not worthy of our attention.",Roma

This is a portrait of our childhood and some middle class families in the 70s and 80s. Some people think that this movie is like the emperor with no cloth, but the truth is that some people are blind and they can not see the beauty of Latinamerican culture, because they have not lived in it. Have you ever heard about something called otherism?, it is when you reject a culture because you are not able to empathize with it due to lack of knowledge. Otherism emerges from the rejection and discrimination of western culture to east cultures (See Edward Said). In this case it wouls be Latinamerican culture.

897,cherry-68,A Transcendent Work of Art into The Human Condition.,10,23 December 2018,"I have never written a review but this movie was so well done and so moving I had to:::This movie has nothing to preach to or sell you. It is only an intimate portrait into human life that allows you to view in Incredible detail.The best type of theme and/or ""moral to the story"" is best hidden (subtly) in the fabric of the story; nuanced in and to only be exposed through the life lived and not the life TOLD.This movie tells you nothing, it only shows you what it is like to be Cleo. Many times it is in the still shots of her quiet reactions to the events unfolding around her that I am moved the most and learn something about the human condition.Lessons of humanity (or the human condition) have been preached and written into countless films for over a century; (There is nothing new there), but in my opinion Roma transcends this method of story telling by not teaching you anything... Roma lets you take part in the suffering, in the mundane, in the laughter,in the beauty of life. Thats the importance of this movie. You are not going on a journey to learn something about these realities of life. You are experiencing them with someone who doesn't have the answers.Alfonso has created a hauntingly beautiful glimpse into his characters experience. It is not a cinematic spectacle or a philosophical statement on life. It is an intimate viewing of what it is to be human without a hollywood narrator and without an emotional score to direct the way we should be viewing it.It is one of my favorite films if not my favorite. A nearly perfect film in my opinion.",Roma

I do not understand how this film elevates indigenous people of MX as they continue to be servants or trinket buskers to this day in most of MX. This is not a rising above scenario for either the mother or the servant. Instead the color of MX was subverted for B&W, interesting dialog was eliminated among the servants, the true way healthcare works (Pay before you get care, but instead she has a magical employer who pays), and weird sequences depicting martial arts that have only tangential association with the plot.

905,neill-roan,Brilliant Differences,10,31 January 2019,"I saw ""Roma"" last night, and loved it. It's not often that something so different from the mainstream comes along. It is exquisite to look at; the cinematography blew me away. The entire movie relies on one camera shooting in black and white. It's no wonder it racked up so many Golden Globe nominations. It is art, pure and simple.So how is it different?1. Most films are heavily edited with lots of cuts from closeup to closeup and from angle to angle. Roma's scenes are shot with one camera in one place, panning through and around the scene.2. Most movies rely on closeups to boost the actor's impact, and to establish an emotional connection between the actor and the audience. I can't remember any closeups at all. As a member of the audience, there is this sense of being in a natural space with the actor, at a distance.3. Most movies punch up scenes and underscore plot narrative using music and sound effects. Roma is almost eerily quiet and natural.4. Most movies rely on plot and action to build momentum. The ordinariness of Roma's plot, its prosaic-ness makes it profoundly relatable. It feels real, increasingly so, as the story unfolds.5. Meta-narrative and subtexts are incredibly subtle, but there is visual and narrative irony everywhere. It is nuanced, but somehow hits home.6. Many characters these days are over-developed and over-wrought. Roma's characters possess an almost documentary quality of reality. They are gentle and affectionate and human-scaled.7. Most movies rely on atypically beautiful actors. Roma's roles are filled with people you might encounter on the street or in the supermarket. The lead actor (Yalitza Aparicio) is a Mexican woman with indigenous features that may or may not strike one as beautiful, depending on one's ability to see and understand her. Her humility, depth, modesty, loyalty, and humanity grow throughout the movie. I found myself coming to love her character and care about her a lot.8. Most black and white movies today are visually contrasty with an almost film noir look about them. They are usually very stylized through use of lighting and idiosyncratic camera angles. If there is one word to describe the visual impact of Roma, it is luminous. I assume that it was carefully lit, but it feels like the film was shot with available light. The scenes in the countryside have the luminosity of a Bierstadt or a Moran, but without the contrived, romanticized feel. The Mexican landscape is just exquisite. I've never seen anything like it.9. The film is shot with the technical virtuosity of great architectural photography. With only a couple of intentional exceptions, there is zero lens distortion in the film. Verticals are kept perfect, and the geometry built into the architecture comes through with clarity and impact. The Roma neighborhood in Mexico City, for which the film is named, is distinctively Mediterranean and mid-Century. It was originally inhabited by Syrian Jews, Greeks, and Turks, and those sensibilities show up in the buildings and details. There is a strong sense of place in the film as a result.10. Most of the time, the camera's aperture is set to leave the entire scene in focus. In several critical moments, the cinematographer opens the aperture, softening the focus and riveting the eye on the character. It is, like everything else in the film, very subtle but it works beautifully.In summary, this was one of the freshest film experiences I've had. Many film-making effects and techniques that are used to penetrate the shell of contemporary cynicism and hold the attention of an ADHD audience are completely absent. This film impeaches notions of what's necessary to build and keep narrative and emotional momentum. If there is one word to describe its artistry, I would say it is ""brave."" Cuaron relies on the best parts of himself and his company to build story, empathy, and impact. I so admire him.",Roma

910,dunathan42,LOST FROM THE START,1,23 January 2019,"When it comes to art, I am not the kind who generally wants to do a ton of research before viewing it. Afterwards, perhaps, if the piece intrigues me. I want to be affected by the art itself. But I certainly should have done my homework before watching 'Roma'. From the start I was unaware we were in Mexico, or that 'Roma' is the name of an upscale suburb of Mexico City (silly me). I kept waiting for this family to move to Rome, Italy, or have some sort of experience in Rome! Anyway, the film's opening scene, covering the opening credits, seems endless and strange, and boring. And the film remains exactly there. The acting is wooden, the pace is unrelentingly that of a snail, and dog poo seems to have a great significance that is lost on me. I read the critical reviews this morning after watching the film, and was flabbergasted that this is a 'masterpiece'. Long-single-takes in B & W are Arthouse favorites, but this film used the technique to no good result. I did not even care about the central character, and I wanted to. The movie ended and I was thinking, ""What happened?"" The answer: A whole lot of no story happened.",Roma
911,Chica_M,Impressive...,10,24 December 2018,"Really impressive. I must say that it took some time to get really into the movie , around 30 minutes, but that merely has to do with my (unconscious and unwanted) expectation of a plot. But it's all about life, the simpleness, the unexpected misery, the joy that you can get of simple things, family. You don't need a traditional plot for that.",Roma
912,ricardo_guzman_price,"A shallow film, with passive and unidimensional characters, and no drama",1,3 February 2020,"This film is about two women in 1970s Mexico: a living-in maid named Cleo, and her upper-middle class boss, Sofía. At the beginning of the film, Sofia is abandoned by her husband, a doctor who is cold and pays zero attention to her, and is also a distant father. Meanwhile, Cleo is knocked up by her boyfriend, a martial artist and political activist. From the cold interaction between the couple, you can tell they have a purely sexual relationship. In fact, he leaves her at the exact moment she announces she's pregnant. Her lack of an emotional reaction seems to say: ""damn it, this is an inconvenience.""
Both Cleo and Sofía spend the entire movie feeling sorry for themselves. But, deep inside, they don't care much about their problems, or at least not enough to do anything about them (and if they don't care about their problems, why should the viewer care?). It's hard to understand why they lament, given that both men are complete jerks: selfish, aggressive, and lacking in any kind of virtue. The logical thing would be for these women to be relieved to get rid of these men. One would expect them to take action to emancipate themselves and find their true selves. But no, they keep on feeling sorry for themselves during two long hours of film.
To be fair, Cleo does do something to get her boyfriend back, or at least get financial support from him. She visits him in the village where he lives. He predictably rejects her and threatens to beat her up if she returns (making a series of ridiculous karate moves to intimidate her). She, as always, remains and leaves.
It is obvious from the beginning of the film that Cleo does not want the baby. And in a conservative culture like Mexico in the 1970s you'd expect her to be torn between keeping the baby and aborting it. This is a source of conflict that the director could have used to create dramatic tension and explore the inner world of the character. Instead, Cleo takes a totally indifferent attitude and carries the baby to term because why not.
Sofia's plot is even more inane: it has no conflict or drama, just a long series of expositive scene, put there to convince us that she loves her husband and she is desperate for him to come back. Sofia forces her children to write letters to her husband, begging him to return. Sofia rejects a man at a party. Sofia complains to her mother explaining what she feels. She also complains that the husband does not send her any money (lack of money is a constant complaint on her part, but it seems to have no consequences: the family's standard of living remains the same throughout the movie).
The film ends (spoiler alert) when both women decide, for no particular reason, that they no longer care about being abandoned. In a deus ex-machina moment, Cleo loses her baby, which she didn't want anyway. Cuarón saves her from having to decide whether to have an abortion or not, a decision that could have revealed something of Cleo's true character. But there's no space for conflict or drama in this film. Afterwards, she simply returns to her secluded life as a maid. Meanwhile Sofía decides to fend for herself by working (what a hard and surprising decision by someone that has no money) and gets a job without any difficulty. Chloe and Sofia are probably the most passive characters in the history of cinema. They never take risks. They never change.
It should be mentioned that this ""story"" (if it can be called that) is supposedly about two women from different social worlds who support each other. But this support comes down to things like this: When Cleo reveals to her boss that she is pregnant, Sofia (surprise) does not fire her. Instead, Sofía takes her to the gynecologist. Later, Sofia sends her mother to a department store to buy a crib for Cleo. These favors do not involve any cost to Sofia and are therefore, from a dramatic point of view, meaningless. Cleo, on the other hand, does nothing to support Sofia. Towards the end of the film (spoiler alert), the family is on the beach and Chloe throws herself into the sea to rescue the drowning children. But this act has absolutely nothing to do with the plot. The scene is there to provoke a moral arousal in the viewer. The scene is also intended to create admiration for a character who, in every other aspect of life, is coward. When they come out of the water, Cleo cries because of her guilt that the baby died. The family hugs her and tells her something like ""everything will be alright"" (more support without cost and hence meaning).
As for the supporting characters, these are life-size cardboard cutouts. All the children do is play and cuddle with the maid. I think there were four of them, but since they had no distinct personality, they were totally indistinguishable from each other. The husband and the boyfriend were, as I said before, one-dimensional, and their only role in the film was to be hated. There was, however, a moment in the film when the husband ha a sympathetic gesture: he encounters Cleo in the hospital, when she is about to give birth, and tells her ""everything will be alright."" More exposition that is insufficient to give the character a positive edge.
Rome is a pretentious, shallow film. An artsy packaging hides its total lack of humanity. Don't fall into that trap.",Roma

Another value is the historical massacre of protesters that took place by Mexican authorities when the Olympics took place in Mexico City. And that was 1968, not ""the early 70s.""

Why in the world was it nominated for so many awards- including best picture and best director for Golden Globes and Oscars to name a few??????Is it because it's done in black and white and set back in the 70's that makes it so 'special'? Is that a reason so many people have jumped on the bandwagon? Something like, ""well so many said it was so good so if I don't think it's good then I must not be getting it so I'll just say it's good too, so I am not left out and/or seem uncultured""? Is it because of the back story of the movie or the fact that Alfonso directed it, wrote it and shot it (which is no easy feat) so it deserves a lot of awards?It is WAY too long!!!!!! WAY TOO LONG!!!! It took forever to actually get to anything with any meaning or impact- I'm talking about 1 1/2 hours into it. We were watching a screener because we are voting for various movies, or not, and we were both baffled as the hype (and we are obviously both in the business). This in no way at all screams best picture to us. At all. Should not have even been nominated.He held on shots that had no reasoning behind them- no impact and/or added to the narrative AT ALL. The transitions were terrible. So many of the times you didn't know what was happening and/or how much time had gone by. There were huge gaps in the story. There was an earthquake and a fire that had ZERO impact on the story- ZERO. A guy broke out into song for no apparent reason. Weird choicesCut it down to 1 1/2 hours and you might have something good. MAYBE have something good.",Roma

Lots of technicalities like deep background good quality Sound, black and white Color etc. All right, so? I think lately we started to fixate to much on the ""technical characteristics"" of the movies. Let's not forget Movie is and art form and technicalities are not the priority of the Arts.-They say it is based on the Director's personal childhood story, fine, I respect that but what is so special about this particular story?! Nothing, there are millions of stories like this one in Mexico and elsewhere. In the art of movie-making the Story must be relatable, sure, but also Unique!-And finally, in my humble opinion, it was too slow, I got bored! I know, many say that this is the uniqueness of the movie that it unfolds on a ""normal"" slow pace but it is not interesting like this!

960,tomchambers99,A touching look at life's hardships,9,19 December 2018,"In Roma every aspect of cinema ranging from performance to cinematography to sound design to raw gut punch moments are carried out with such care, detail and love that you can't help but be deeply immersed in the world that Cuarón builds; it's so vivid and detailed it feels like Cuarón was able to trap the past in a bottle and pour it onto the big screen for all to see.
There is a strong emphasis on the visual in Roma, as Cuarón has taken the mantle of director of photography, (a position usually reserved for long-time collaborator, friend and three time Oscar winner Emmanuel 'Chivo' Lubezki) and sets out the film's own unique visual vocabulary which is undeniably beautiful but also wonderfully effective at commanding your attention and casting that wonderful spell that tricks you into forgetting that you're watching a film.
As the opening credits play out over a singular shot of a tiled floor being mopped, the water reflecting a window of light into the sky where planes can be seen slowly drifting overhead, we know that we are in safe hands and oh boy do these hands feel soft and warm. The film oozes compassion and empathy, as Cuarón is most interested in examining human hardship and how women are, as the mother of the family tells Cleo, completely alone in this world, and cinema as Cuarón imagines it, is super effective at describing the afflictions of the individual. Though the film is dedicated to Cleo, the point of view of the film is not restricted to her's alone, Cuarón often places the eyeline at a child's height which helps create one of the film's most interesting dynamics that children are often completely oblivious to the darker more painful narratives swirling above their heads.
The film is not that interested in hitting plot points or setting up character arcs, in fact it takes pride in the way it ignores most of the storytelling tips you'd find in Robert McKee's ""Story"", and that is one of Roma's biggest triumphs, it is able to devote itself to observing characters slowly change as life has its way, the film has an enormous amount of time for simply watching it's characters behave, a luxury that most films can't afford.
Roma is beautiful, unique and full of compassion and fully deserving of your 2 hours 15 minutes.",Roma

967,Dreamloam,Beautiful and moving experience for the right kind of viewer,10,12 June 2019,"Before watching this, I didn't know too much about it except that it was going to be a slow, visually-oriented, foreign language film. I have seen and love many films of this type by filmmakers such as Ingmar Bergman, Federico Fellini, Krzysztof Kieslowski, Satyajit Ray, Wong Kar-wai, Akira Kurosawa, and Bela Tarr, but I know that you need to be in the right frame of mind to invest in and enjoy them. It was over a year before I finally felt like I was in the right mood, but once I watched this it was a powerfully moving experience.After watching Roma, I was disheartened to see the overwhelming number of one star reviews posted here on IMDb. I can only surmise that the critical and award season hype around this film, combined with the popularity of Netflix, is what led so many people to watch this movie without knowing what they were getting themselves into and having such a negative reaction to it.Unlike films that try to fill every second with action, dialogue, jokes, drama, and a fast-paced plot, this film lingers on moments that feel true to human life. Cuarón shows more than he tells, which can come off as pretentious to those used to the over-explained and generic plots used in blockbuster movies to accommodate as broad of an audience as possible. You may feel somewhat bored during parts of Roma, but for a thoughtful and patient viewer, the quiet spaces in this type of film make you as much a participant as a viewer by giving you time to think your own thoughts and feel your own emotions.",Roma

984,j_c_ortiz,A story about life. Through a compelling lens,8,18 December 2018,"Review of Alfonso Cuaron's ""Roma""It has become expected of Alfonso Cuaron to create a deep emotional and personal connection with the audience, through strongly developed characters and complex but familiar stories combined with often elaborate cinematography, involving music and plenty of symbolism and metaphor - as he did in previous films such as Children Of Men, Y Tu Mama También and Great Expectations - in his latest showing ""Roma"" he might have taken it a step further.Sometimes subtle and sometimes bold, Cuaron brings you deeper than his other films by shooting in wide format to focus you line of sight and then punch you with memorable scenery, in a low contrast black and white to distract less from the storyline, in mostly natural lighting to make you feel familiar to the environment, with still shots or slow basic camera movements that framed the entire family rather than one character so you'll know is not a story of someone rather that somethings, and with sound production that is so intricate and so masterfully recorded and mixed that is worthy of is own review (and an Oscar).And as far as the story... while your first impresión of Roma might be of a documentary, Cuaron only referenced his upbringing while propelling into a much broader story. And while it may seem lengthy, it's merely just long enough to to carefully present the details.
Roma is not so much a portrait of the once opulent Colonia Roma of Mexico City but largely a display of modern society, specially of the role of women, with all their joys and sorrows, their influence over men and the influence of men over them which happens to be destructive at times.The global appeal of this story is subliminally injected trough the casual passing of an airplane, the karate practicing boyfriend, the the summer home family outing with an American family or the fathers work trips to Quebec but mostly with the story not focusing so much on the idiosyncrasies of Mexican culture but on the very broad appeal of the events of the film. he alludes to the broader appeal in a scene were the family is watching on TV, two astronauts struggling in space, reminiscent to his film Gravity, where we were at the edges of our seats by events that none of us will ever experience while Roma is so personal that is sure to strike a chord with anyone breathing.Cuaron presents all of this through the story of Cleo, a indigenous house maid for a wealthy Mexican family in the 70s. Throughout the film we're presented with the social disparities that plague not only Mexican society but global. Such as in a scene where Cleo prepares a soft boiled egg for one of the children and as she shakes some salt on it, the child takes the salt shaker and pour his desired amount on the egg. Cleo deeply cares for the children and they love her as well but this scene clearly shows us how the children as much as they may respect her see her a mother figure they also have entrenched their role of masters. Or when Cleo was welcomed into the family room to share a tv show with the family and as she sat down one of the children embraced her only to be later asked by the mother to make a tea for the man of the house. You see the Mother embrace and comfort Cleo as a member of the family and the children tell her they love her as she tucks them away while later taking out family frustrations on her.And while these disparities exist, Cuaron also shows how we are also all alike. By a forest fire at the summer home where both the wealthy and the help end up trying to extinguish the flames. In a scene worthy of cinema history by the way. A scene so loaded in meaning. Where all of us were united against the fire. Or when Cleos relationship deteriorates at the same time as the Mothers. They both suffer loss and betrayal in levels devastating to each and that only brings them closer and makes them equal.This is a film about many aspects of life and in many beautiful scenes we metaphorically see how life continues in the face of disaster such when babies are saved from falling debris from an earthquake by the incubator they're sleeping in. Or when we see street vendors pass by as the family is braking apart. But we see this even brighter towards the ending of the film where despite the hardship endured by the family, where the mother facing her new life with four children with her head held high and where Cleo is forced to face her deepest fears and accept her reality, they all drive on.It is not a coincidence that this story of struggle is depicted through the experiences of women. Cuaron clearly places women in their rightful place as pillars of an ungrateful society. Throughout the film you see Cleo scooping up the dogs poop and washing the floor from the garage so the master doesn't run it over with his big fancy car. The message couldn't be clearer.This film places women of all walks of society in a common trait. That of the carriers of life.Alfonso Cuaron has always succeeded in bringing us films that are as emotionally connecting as they are visually rich. Is this a masterpiece for him? Maybe. For cinema? Most likely.",Roma

986,muslit1,A Masterpiece,9,18 December 2018,"I've read a number of reviews here - quite a few, in fact. Here's what I've come up with.If you're going to see 'Roma' for character development, you will be disappointed. There really isn't any to speak of, and I don't think the director was interested in it, either. What Cuaron IS interested in is SHOWING things happening to people and their reaction to it, something akin to Eisenstein's 'Potemkin'. You don't 'know' those sailors, or the woman on the steps with her glasses: they are archtypes, but very human, reacting to events. This is what you have in 'Roma'. Most of the dialog reinforces it. For the most part, it is banal. There are no long speeches, no philosophising. The events can be mundane, dramatic, horrifying, emotional. I think what Cuaron wanted was for the audience to react to those events on a viceral level, as the people in his film do, expunging the personal with something universal. On this level, I think he succeeds. Furthermore, the camera is often at a distance from the people and events he photographs, re-inforcing the objective over the subjective.As for a dramatic arch, there is one, but not in any traditional sense. The exposition lasts much longer than normal, and the drama that follows is compressed by comparison. Some viewers were put off by this. I was not.There is also much talk of 'slice of life' concerning 'Roma'. I suppose it is a slice of life. But here time is purely cinematic, not in any sense of things happening in real time.Visually the film is very controlled. You have very few cuts, and what cuts there are, are very unobtrusive. What you have are long takes - panning and revealing, often in great detail, sometimes revealing something very simple. This emphasis on what the camera does was sometimes bothersome for me. One can be too conscious of the camera. But more times than not, the 'revealing' compensates for this stylistic rigidity. It is a question of accepting the director's style.Very few have commented on the sound design of the film, which to me is one of the marvels of 'Roma'. Cuaron uses surround sound creatively and expressively, not just of things coming and going. One is completely immersed in the sound of a barrio, or a country home, a festival, or the ocean, often heightening the sound for emotional effect. The audio becomes a crucial factor in the ambience of the film.Another wonder of 'Roma' is it's iconic imagery. I'm not going to mention what those images are, but I can think of three. (I can think of four in all of Bergman's output.)And lastly, there is no traditional soundtrack. Just ambient sounds.I highly recommend this film. But I think one has to go with an open mind. This is NOT a Hollywood film, where most things are spelled out for you, as in point A to point B to point C. And I think a viewer has to work a little in order to take in what the film is SHOWING, not what it is TELLING.",Roma

Why are adults always so serious? What are the things that they keep hiding from us?This movie takes you through a journey in the life of the unsug hero of your childhood: the one who always knew were your lost socks would be found, the one who guaranteed food would be on the table everyday, at the right time, cooked the way you liked... The one who would almost never hear a ""thank you"", but never demand it.Cuarón answers the questions of his childhood and examines with great care and attention the roles that created the world in which he was brought up through many different dimensions: class, gender, age, politics, culture, language, offering a beautiful portrait of a point in time that created the mexican society of today and still resonates with him.I never write reviews but after seeing the scary reaction in the review section here I had to come defend this movie. People complain about the characters, or the slow pace, or the subtitles... But what really got me is that people say it had ""NO STORY"", and that proves the point of the movie beautifully - this is (to some extent) the story of most of us, and the fact that we can't recognize that contribution in our past is heartbreaking.Like your grandma, like your mother, like your nanny, Cleo is a woman too, and she has a story deeply entangled in your own.

1030,adrrdafla,"Aesthetically beautiful, but empty in content.",6,28 February 2019,"Roma reminded me of a couple of other awarded modern ""classics"" in its structure and, let's say, intention. Movies like Manchester by the sea - also produced by Netflix - and Moonlight gave me the same feeling of frustration: a huge sensation of emptiness, contrasted by the aesthetical pretentiousness that their auteurs evidently have.When I watched Roma, I was already aware that the technical elements were a must-see: Cuarón's cinematography, for instance, was said to be astonishing. Indeed, for a cinema amateur like me, these factors looked fairly enjoyable, and composed a great artistic atmosphere, stylistically speaking. In a nutshell, I can only praise this superficial aspect of the picture, and I agree with Roma's lovers that it make the movie, at least, watchable.The big problem is that this perfection is not accompanied by emotional captivation. The point is not exactly the lack of storytelling - there are movies based on mere daily life that contain the necessary deepness, like the Brazilian picture Aquarius. None of the sub-plots Cuarón created managed to emotional catharsis, and this seems to be not due to the banality of the events themselves, but to the prioritization of the picture as shape. The director seemed more occupied with maintaining and expanding his recognizable trademarks, and not with developing the emotional conflicts of his characters - or making a comment about the implicit power relations between a maid and her boss.To conclude, I couldn't forget to mention the contradiction of a movie that, intending to be an art project in its very physical meaning, was not done to be originally exhibited in cinemas, excluding exceptional sessions. To paraphrase Almodóvar's state about the Palme d'Or, it would be kind of paradoxical to give a Best Picture award at the Oscars to a movie which was not meant to be watched in the big screen.",Roma

Most of what comes about is truthful, I would dare to say it seems autobiographical from Cuaron's point of view. Women, married or single were treated badly, cheated on, abandoned and ignored. Women are objects in most of our modern societies, so that rang true. Women that worked as house help were also mighty mistreated like Cleo was. They are loved because they are indispensable, necessary for a family to have certain status or appear they do, mos often than not, they were underpaid because room and board was included in a working arrangement, which brings me to my furious point of contention here. Mexicans of certain status that can afford to keep a small staff were and maybe still are slave owners, period. The help will get Sunday off but coming back from your day ""off"" they will find a filthy kitchen and disarray all over the house. So, what is the point of the movie? I lost you Alfonso, I lost you.

1041,jordanbatchelor,Not simply slice of life,9,16 December 2018,"Many reviewers have commented on the realism and slice of life perspective Roma gives, but it also has a touch of mysticism or magical realism. Cleo is like a superhero for the family's children. The television performer in the TV show within the movie, who also reappears when Cleo searches for Fermin, named Professor Zovek, claims to have powers. He closes his eye, raises his arms toward the sky and clasps his hands together, and bends one leg so that one of his feet is placed alongside the other leg's knee. Although the crowd laugh at his supposed power, they try to perform the minor feat and fail--only Cleo is able to do it. When Professor Zovek hears the crowd's laughter, he asks, ""What did you expect, for me to lift a jet?"" A moment earlier, in fact, when he was performing his stunt, a large jet is seen and heard flying directly over his head, very intentionally in the shot. At several points in the movie, a jet can be seen flying over Cleo's head, particularly in the final sequence when she walks up the staircase to the roof of the house. Furthermore, Cleo's inner self has the ability to affect the real world, in good and bad ways. Major events like the fire and the earth quake erupt out of the events that are happening to Cleo as she journeys through the realization that she has become pregnant with a child whose father doesn't want any part of it. However, her ""powers"" also extend to the good, as she is able to save two children from drowning, despite not being able to swim, near the end of the movie.Roma is not nearly a slice of life, but Cuaron's directing makes the camera shots very obvious because of their beauty, and his directing and writing of the movie's plot puts Cleo in a role above everyone else. She is so important that her inner life affects the outer world, often for the better.",Roma

Just notice how every single important male character is depicted.The only scene which really caught me was the final one, because the lead actress finally beautifully broke her Kristen Stewart-stoneface.This is just porn for your feelings.

1043,ninaegert,Roma fails to get things right,3,16 February 2019,"I went to the theater expecting to be wowed--instead I was shocked at how critics have missed the problems with this film. There are some intelligent hints of a brilliant film in the opening shots---but the film contains serious anachronistic errors (in costuming, in when training in martial arts became a public phenomena, etc), but most importantly, just basic human reactions to difficult situations into which the characters have been inserted.
I would not expect some younger or foreign viewers to catch some of the anachronistic points---but long before a film is edited together and marketed to the public someone in production should have caught these items and fixed the story line----the worst being the birth scene (since when does a woman who is crowning not scream her guts out? What kind of medical team would be more worried about whether they have their scrubs on than getting the patient medicated---or noting that the baby is coming to fast to do that?) and the ocean scene.
And we learn nothing from this film---yes, so apparently in Mexico we are to believe that an upper-class family loves their servant like a member of the family---but the basic theme is that men are jerks.

There was an obvious theme of water throughout and every shot emphasizing water was oddly satisfying to the eye.The acting was great. The actress portraying Cleo was especially impressive. Specifically with her facial acting.However I will say Roma misses out on much emotional punch. There is little music which I feel could have greatly improved the emotion of the film.In addition the film has a lack luster story. I understand that the film is putting the audience in the point of view of a 1970s maid in Mexico during the political turmoil occurring at the time, which was effective. It really opens your eyes to how much Cleo did for this family, and how much her help went unnoticed by others. The end was satisfying because after saving the two kids, she had in a way restored herself after losing her child. In addition, she recieved well deserved praise from the family. But back to the lacking aspect, the story did not have enough excitement for me. We simply followed the semi-interesting life of this maid. I need more.Overall Roma was a true beauty of a film. The camera work and images were top notch. A quality addition to foreign language film.",Roma

A great look into 1970 Mexico City.The film can feel a bit slow at times with creeping panoramic shots and no dialogue. I didn't see the need for it to be in black and white.

1056,lukietd-55963,In the best of the decade,10,17 September 2018,"Alfonso Cuarón might be my favourite living director, jesus that was brilliant. Where to begin with this masterpiece...Well - to start - 'Roma' is one of the most beautiful films of the decade, every shot is masterfully executed, blocked, framed, and detailed. Cuarón himself was the cinematographer in this project, and he did a phenomenal job. You can't help but have your jaw on the floor the entire runtime. Right from the opening shot I knew I was in for something masterful. Cuarón's signature long takes were ever prevelant here, and each was as masterful as the last. Sometimes he lingers on a subject beautifully to exentuate a point, or makes a small adjustment to a shot - giving it a completely different meaning. The symmetry and pure brilliance of every single scene sends chills down your spine. I won't spoil it, but there's a particular shot near the middle of the film involving a man singing, where Caurón plays with the contrast between background and foreground so powerfully it got even got a few tears rolling.Cuarón's visual motifs find their way across the film, tying the somewhat loose plot into a resounding and heart wrenching force. Again - no spoilers - but he uses planes, water, cars, dogs, and themes of birth and death to represent metaphorically or sometimes literally how characters feel and how their relationships to eachother are. The lead performance from Yalitza Aparicio was great, especially considering this is the first film she's ever acted in. Hats off to the casting director for plucking her out of obscurity and having her end up delivering such a resounding performance. I really hope this movie will jump start a career for her.This film is a grandmaster at the top of his game, and is breathtaking perfection from start to finish. Alfonso Cuarón returns to his Spanish roots for a passion project he's been talking about since 2006. He excercises almost total creative control by wearing a lot of hats on the production. He directed, co-produced, wrote, edited, and photographed this film. A complete 180 from his last three studio works (although some of them are masterpieces), ROMA exercises more storytelling prowess than them, and no one will be calling this film 'style over substance' no matter how beautiful it is. 'Roma' is another Cuarón masterpiece, and I'm happy that it will be seen to a vastly larger audience because of the Netflix distribution. However, that is also a double edged sword - because this is a film that is best seen on the big screen, but I'm still pleased more people will be exposed to this masterclass in filmmaking. I urge you to watch this the second you have the chance, because Cuarón has made one of the best films of the decade.",Roma

1061,joshkurtzer,An amazing film for the history of cinema. But maybe not for the audience's history.,8,8 January 2019,"""I just watched this film and I didn't really like it that much as everyone else does. But I have no idea why I don't.""This film creates exceptional reality with the details of the characters, and how they traverse with each other in their day-to-day lives. The way that the characters related to one another, and spoke with each other was just as if we went away for a short time into our cinemas or screens, to view a family 50 years ago go about their lives. It was an amazing film to experience as an aspiring filmmaker, but because of all that realism, I felt it left something crucially important out.Watching this film was like going out on a date with an attractive girl/guy who had all the great features they can have, but there was no real personal connection with me. They just sat there on the date in front of me, telling me about their lives and what they did, instead of having any real relation with them about what they do or have done.The reason that I think most people dislike this film (for the odd reasons they state) is that there was no film to audience connection, or in other terms, that it was passive. Yes of course there was continual heart warming emotion displayed throughout all areas of the scenes, but some of the scenes conveyed too much realism (yes too much) to not even address the audience watching the film. And no, if you are thinking that the film should have been more active with the viewer, with on-the-nose dialogue, or voice-overs towards the audience, no. I just wanted a reason to keep watching, that's what connection is within a film. Yes the acting, cinematography, editing, etc was all superb, but there was no real reason I wanted to play along with the film.I felt that it was as if the film was so well executed it won the hearts of many cinema lovers, and filmmakers, but it did not cater for the audience of the world who aren't into the minor details of cinema. A good story is something that the audience should be apart of from the opening scene, to the ending shot- as to be honest, I sadly didn't feel within this film, like the quote stated above.It spent too much time looking good for the people, instead of really delving into the hearts of the audiences, which is what I personally love out of a good film. As a filmmaker however, I can definitely say I will be watching this again and again due to its immaculate execution of filmography and craft.Thank you Alfonso Cuarón.8/10

1077,patrwright,Roma is a problematic film,1,14 September 2018,"Cuaròn's latest film, ""Roma,"" borrows its title from the upper class Mexico City neighborhood where the director grew up. The film is an ode to Libo, Cuaròn's indigenous nanny, whose fictional name is Cleo (interpreted by the excellent Yalitza Aparicio). Cuaròn specifically dedicated the film to Libo while accepting the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. In the same speech, he professed his love for his country as well.""Roma"" tells the story of the relationship between Cleo and Sofia, the family's matriarch, as they witness the social changes that affect Mexico as a whole and, subsequently, their relationship as well - since the latter is permanently stained with an unsolved (and unsolvable) heavy socioeconomic and class division. Meanwhile, news of a terrifying clash between students and a paramilitary group spread around the city (the 1971 clash ended up killing 120 people). Cuarón said in an interview that this violent act ""scarred Mexican society permanently, and transformed Mexicans as individuals.""I disliked this film, for both filmic and moral reasons. I found its aesthetics too unfit for a story about the suffering of Mexicans. Cuarón puts too much emphasis on the beauty of its craft, and such embellishment clashes with the ugliness of this historical moment in Mexican history. I have a huge problem with the film's jarringly clean aesthetics, which mirror Cuarón's endless quest for visual perfection (he also shot this film), despite the fact that the subject matter of this film isn't so glossy. Aesthetics is a language. Cuarón speaks the sophisticated language of Hollywood (courtesy of Netflix and the $100M budget) to tell the story of the people of Mexico who have been left behind. To me, the dissonance is unbearable. Last but not least, the visual approach is nothing new - despite the desaturated, B/W look.Then there are the moral issues. In Mexico, there are 3 million domestic workers who aren't legally registered, without any access to welfare. They are basically slaves. Needless to say, the overwhelming majority of them are indigenous. This is a class and race issue. Cuarón loves Libo. He loves his indigenous maid. But Libo continues to live her life and an underprivileged woman in Mexico, while the director lives in Hollywood. Cuarón has not spent a single word denouncing such social disparity in Mexico. He hasn't done it in a single interview. Why? Doesn't he care about the condition of indigenous maids who are basically enslaved by the rich? Perhaps he just cares about his Libo, and that's it? Love without restitution is an empty word. Personally, I am tired of empty films made by empty directors. I may be the minority here, but I really disliked ""Roma.""Thanks for reading.",Roma

I couldn't believe how long it was and yet I was totally immersed in the cinematography and the attention to detail was sublime. Even the opening scene showing the maid doing a menial task of washing the dog poo off the tiles you see the shadow of a plane flying overhead depicting another world outside her world.

1081,fuchsbund,It's the life's most ordinaries drama.,9,21 July 2019,"At first, to agree the many other comments prior to this: the film needs quite an effort to get used to the very long lasting shots and slowly developing story. But once gotten into it, it offers a wonderful insight to life.For life is not all action, one unique and memorable event to the next with nothing in-between. Such as many other films make the illusions. Instead it's all about the big problems, and, more often than not, the smalls. There are many unexpected burdens everyone gets to bear on his shoulders. Yet, most of them aren't much bigger than the making of food for the kids and looking for them not to run too far away on the way to the cinema.But there is another message as well. There is really just a small number of people that really care for you, if there even are some. Most obstacles have to be faced and passed alone. There is no big fame and admiration that comes for the many countless helpers in the world that do not just make the meal for your kids, but might even save them from drowning in the sea.In the end, the film gave me the impression to life that life doesn't always have to be big with excitement making you feel as high as mountains, and pain as deeply cutting as seas. It's most often just the simple being at some place, and working at some place, and being with others at some other place, that makes life life. It's the ordinary every day routines that belong to life as much as the biggest emotions and most memorable experiences.It's really a film that does not entertain but needs you to open up your mind and see the beauty in the simple things of life.",Roma

1086,JackLoughWilson,"Richly-textured, intimate and profound; Cuarón's ""Roma"" is a sombre meditation of a woman's work",10,15 December 2018,"From Academy-Award winner Alfonso Cuarón, director of ""Gravity"" & ""Children of Men"", with his newest picture, ""Roma"" he draws inspiration from very personal regions of his own childhood. Set in Mexico City, 1970 (and parts of '71), predominately in the neighbourhood of Colonia Roma - of which the film is titled. The civil unrest and class warfare of time are seen through the eyes of Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio), the gentle maid of Sofía (Marina de Tavira) and her family. Upon falling pregnant, the naïve Cleo must navigate her way through the trials and tribulations that not only befall her, but the evolving city of Mexico around her.With Alfonso Cuarón in more than just the directors seat, he also produces, writes, edits and - perhaps most impressively - cinematographs this piece of film. From a technical aspect, ""Roma"" is without a doubt a masterpiece. Shot in gorgeous black and white, and comprised of many dazzling long shots that capture even the smallest of details, adding to the intimacy; as well as serving as Cuarón's notable artistic signature: combining long shots and skilfully-choreographed long takes, to maximum effect - whether it be humorous or poignant.Thematically-deep, perhaps ""Roma's"" most notable theme is that of the place - or more so the perseverance - of women under the thumb of a patriarchal society. Cleo, our protagonist, is the heart of this film; she lives a relatively modest existence, vacillating from her duties to Sofía, and occasionally frequenting a short-term boyfriend; but the obstacles that face her - as well as Sofía - are testament to the endurance and strength of women - with Cuarón clearly modelling these characters with some thought of the woman in his life in mind.Upon the films ending, this specific audience member was left in a stunned silence; hypnotised and truly moved by what I had just watched. ""Roma"" is a film so narratively-rich and deeply heartfelt, conjured from such a personal place in the directors own life. Cuarón can add this to his ever-growing list of masterpieces: ""Children of Men"", ""Gravity"" and now: ""Roma"".",Roma
1087,edgarsolis,A masterpiece!,10,8 December 2018,"Roma is the latest movie of a Mexican filming director, and Oscar winner Alfonso Cuarón.
Through this amazing piece of art, Cuarón opened his memories and releases a package of a pure personal and family intimacy.all of this wrapped with tenderness and warm moments, but at the same time with a raw reality that spread on the screen the cruelty of the broken human condition that belongs to all of us.
In the midst of the daily battles that we all fight, and through the lenses of a normal mid class family in the Roma neighborhood in Mexico City, Cuarón depicts the surroundings of everyone's life in the 70ths, with all the dynamics of people's lives, coming and going in the everydayness of our broken and fullness humanity, describing the relationships that represents to belong. The normal and little details are presented with a masterful hand through the lenses both technically and emotional of Cuarón's eyes...
There is not a typical villain or a stereotypical hero that we can hate or inspire us from a Hollywood movie type. There is no cultural holocaust to wipe out the views of others, instead we all are there...and from the normality of everyone, a simple and humble character emerge to slap all our pride, racial, cultural, economical bias and divisions. This character's powerful and tender personality is presented in the midst of a social and political turmoil to let us know that a simple act of presence and care could be the difference between life and death. That's the power of this movie, it makes us reflect and feel deep inside of us our humanity with outstanding normality, humbleness and emotion, the kind of movie that you'll never forget",Roma

No doubt we'll have movie elitists desperately evangelizeing this film to non believers and blaming our immature cinefile pallet.

The film is simply a year in the life of an upperclassman family and a Cleo there long time servant played out with an historical violent uprising set in the background. There is no social commentary made with regard to the Cleo's poverty stricken family or the power disparity between her and the employer.If you need to wax on about the graceful pace, cinematography and obscure metaphors without mentioning a story then you know you've got problems. This guy certainly knows how to make a movie, what he doesn't know is how to make it interesting.
If your desperate to escape the ubiquitous marvel movies like I was, sadly this movie is not an option. This is a movie equivalent of ""Slow TV"" on Valium. I would seriously choose to watch a 24hr train journey then endure this overhyped movie.

Turns out, that wasn't required.The first thing I noticed and the thing I loved the most about Roma, is the way it's shot. Any other director would have preferred a more vintage black and white look. But Alfonso Cuarón decided to go with a 65 mm lens, giving the movie a pristine, non-grainy look, like a modern day memory of a past. The soft contrast and the bright highlights look beautiful. The fixed camera and slow pans are add to the aesthetics of the beautiful imagery. The framing and composition are meticulous. It is a beautiful looking movie.Next up, the characters. The central character is the maid, Chleo played by first time actress Yalitza Aparicio. She's awesome. She is a silent character. Not that she's mute or that she talks rarely, it's just when you look at her in her maid clothes, doing away the dishes, she'll strike you as a sweet and silent person. I really cared about her character, I was invested. I was scared when she was scared, happy when she was happy and sad when she was sad. That's the movie's biggest achievement in my opinion. The other characters are nicely fleshed out as well, especially the mother's character. The child actors were surprisingly good, too.The story of Roma is a deeply emotional and personal one. But not everyone can relate to it. As of me, I could relate to it and I loved each moment of it.Bottom line, Roma is a visual masterpiece.

If you were to flip back and forth between this movie and the Aquarium Channel you hit the same levels of excitement.We found the characters were almost completely undeveloped, Cleo was wooden and somewhat morose except for a couple of short sequences in the movie. You never really got any sort of connection with her, or any other character in the movie. The plot was a number of disjointed and mostly unconnected vignettes.I must say the endless shots of piles of dog poo were very artfully done.

If you watch movies to be entertained you will be sorely disappointed, however if you watch movies as an alternative to going to a museum then you might like this. There is very little depth to the characters and the storyline is almost non-existent. It reminded me a little of the great Italian films off of the 50s & 60s such as the Bicycle Thieves except that those movies had a storyline and kept me captivated throughout. Complete tosh.",Roma
1109,jackbarry-18111,A Nearly Perfect Film,9,5 January 2019,I saw this film and was compelled to join IMDb and write my very first review. So let's get into it. My only issue was that the film had subtitles. This is a personal opinion of mine. I always find it more difficult to connect with the characters and engage with the story at full potential during movies with subtitles. And I found myself a few times looking at my cellphone during the film as a result of this. If you don't mind subtitles then you won't have this same issue. If you do mind subtitles then I highly recommend you give it your all to finish the movie till the very end and give it your focus. It's an amazingly beautiful film. I was blown away by the cinematography. Genius. Masterpiece. Jaw dropping beauty. Women endure so much and for me at least this film highlights their strength dignity love compassion brilliance and at the same time places a spotlight on their flaws and their fears. It's a slow movie but it builds up to a shocking climax where even though you want to look away you simply can't because you don't even want to blink an eye as to not miss even one moment of this artwork.,Roma

1114,danasimone-58549,I enjoyed despite my ADHD tendencies with the subtitles,7,27 January 2019,"I decided to do a movie of Roma for a couple of reasons. It's not widely-released in movie theaters in the US and it will not be apart of the AMC Theaters Best Picture Showcase (#AMCBPS) despite being one of the eight nominated films for Best Picture. Why? From what I read, in short, the movie rights were not released to American theaters only to Netflix.Colonia Roma is a neighborhood in Mexico City set in 1970 and 1971. It is not the name of the leading actress like I thought. This movie is said to be 90 percent of scenes from Director Cuaron's childhood memories based upon a nanny he adored named Libo (hence, the tribute during the credits). The story is mainly about a nanny, Cleo, who struggles with her life once she becomes pregnant and abandoned by the baby's father. While at the same time, she nurtures four children of a mom (Sofia) that also becomes abandoned by her husband. I won't write much about this storyline to avoid spoilers.However, here are several random notes to give you some perspective. The entire movie is told via English subtitles so don't look away; you need to be focused. The riot in the movie is known as the Corpus Christie Massacre. There's one male nude scene. There's a very graphic scene involving Cleo's baby at birth that is a little disturbing; so brace yourself. Cleo and Sofia share a knowing look of despair without words when a wedding is taking place next to them while they eat ice cream with the children. It's obvious the pain the two women are feeling as they both struggle putting their life back on track after their devastating heartbreaks. I found it odd that the children got painful sunburn during their beach visit but the mom didn't have any sunscreen. Interesting that huffing in the 70's is equivalent to juuling now. How many dead animals can one person have in one house? Oh my! Taxidermy overload. Also noteworthy was how families back in the day had one television and everyone sat together and watched the same TV shows. The scene I adored the most was when Cleo laid head-to-head with PePe (the youngest child) while he was mad at his brother who just hurt his feelings. This scene showed you how passionate and aware Cleo was about those children. Cuaron filmed this movie in Mexico City, which resulted in several misdated appearances regarding the airplanes and automobiles seen. Finally, the ending took me by surprise as I thought there was going to be another scene to wrap up the story, but it wasn't. Let me know if you felt the same way.You will likely enjoy this movie despite the subtitles. The problems women experienced in the 70s is the same today but now more women are smarter, stronger and better equipped as Female Masterpieces to survive life's roadblocks and setbacks. Catch it on Netflix before the Oscars air on February 24.",Roma

I have often said that if a movie does not capture you in the first fifteen minutes, then you will have problems. I have seem many good movies that all have this in common. Some movies have captivated me in the first two and a half minutes such is the magnificent direction. So what of Mona then.The high definitition black and white cinematography is beautiful and so are the choice of actors. But both of us found the movie to be very dull and slow moving. Often I had to hit the fast forward button. For folks to give this a 10/10 reminds me of a few professional press reviewers who may give a movie 5/10 only for me to thoroughly enjoy it. Sometimes viewers just do not see things the same way and that is part of life.One of the redeeming features of this film was the birth scene using a rubbery figure which totally gave away what was to occur. My partner enjoyed the masterful stick display by Fermin. So many long sticks she said to me.Unfortunately this film was a long and drawn out process that failed to engage us both and had very little to no entertainment value.

If you don't like Solaris (I loathe that rubbish), this is, maybe, half a notch up from it (at least there's some dialogue in Roma).The cinematography is the only aspect of this movie I found endearing, but despite being a big fan of black and white imagery, I wish it were in color, as that would have really taken me back to my childhood (I grew up in Latin America in the 70's, even though my family was blessed by only one live-in maid and my family's friends didn't own huge ranches in the countryside).I was able to decide that this movie was going nowhere (for me at least) when the dude in the Sasquatch costume stopped to sing while a fire was raging in the forest.

The film's characters are the clinically well acted and have genuine realistic dialogue and interaction. They feel too much like realistic people: Cuaron must have been spying on an actual family for a few years to get communication and characters this well. One field with it drastically suffers in though is it doesn't really have one story it has 50 we don't care about and even though it was specifically set in the 70s, a time of great turmoil, it takes no use of the political atmosphere

After the film was over, he turned to me and said, ""Wow. I can relate. That's what it was like (growing up in Mexico)."" I was so appreciative of this film and the connection it made to my father and to me. It was BEAUTIFULLY shot and told and honest story. My father also commented on it's originality, which I agree with. I can see how some might take this as a ""dry"" or ""boring"" film. This might be from the viewers who expected explosions and CGI and action and all the things that the current industry seems to pass off as good story telling. It might also come from the viewer who does not have the cultural experience or background to appreciate this very specific and heartfelt story. If it does not win any awards, I will be shocked.

Carefully staged hence not a dull moments in the movie. Water means woman. Airplane fly and fly and fly. Prime time TV show in the afternoon. She waited the glass was filled then turn around and broke the glass and you know something bad will happen. So meaningful. She came up, she saw her master, then fire in the woods. There's little fire for kids, big fire for adults to pour waters to, everyone had their parts. Celebrity points the finger to the sky at the exact time when airplane fly over his head. Shopping at the right place at the right time to encounter the riot and the ex and then give birth right after. So dramatic, so Hollywood. I cried like a baby. Also loved the kid good looking boy band hair style after swimming. All embraced together at the end and still no one blocking the beautiful sun. Many staged act, one scene after another. Good surround sound. Every character knows the exact time to go in and when to act to the camera at the right position in every frame. Not one second more, not one second less. Many scene has the Hollywood magical sunlight. Everyone had a glow in their head when firing the gun. The smoke, the dust, the shadows, Beautiful. Eye popping. Like a girl with a beautiful make up. Kids knew when the adults will finished their conversation then go into the camera then talk. Just like seeing a well staged play. A new kind of film. A well staged black and white documentary commercial art film. Good job. After watching this movie, I love Mexico and suddenly, I felt like I am a good person and that's feels great. I also got many likes in my account from my friends after saying good things about it. Now I know how to get more LIKES. Easy. Also knew how to predict what kind of film will win at the awards. Also easy. Like a prophet. Want to go to Mexico to enjoy the everyday magical Hollywood sunlight and stand still to look cool. Love Mexico and this film.

1143,latingroove,Emotional Masterpiece,9,26 February 2019,"""Roma"", directed by Alfonso Cuarón,is an evocative little gem set during Mexico's ""Dirty War"" of the 70's where clashes between students and the government resulted in a fatal bloodbath.Cuarón uses the scenario only as a supportive framework to his core narrative-the journey of Cleo,an indigenous live-in maid and babysitter employed in an upper/middle class Mexican family.""Roma""works predominantly due to its brilliant directorial touches and luscious black and white cinematography that aptly captures the troubled mexican milieu of the times on the one hand and the vagaries of life on the other.Cuarón uses imagery masterfully to mirror the multi-layered conflicts of the film.The soapy tiled floor,a broken tea cup,the ungainly family car and the constant presence of a household pet are delicate nuances that give us an insight into the characters' internal dilemmas.Through his portrayal of two women from diametrically different strata of society and their devastating personal calamities,Cuarón shows us that life is the greatest leveller -that tragedy affects everyone albeit in different ways-that the cycle of life and death is an intrinsic part of all human existence-that sometimes real family is defined not by blood but by choice.The film unfolds at a leisurely pace and culminates in a powerful gut wrenching scene that is cathartic and honours the dignity inherent in both women.Unlike the director's other efforts namely ""Gravity""and ""Harry Potter 3""( the only 2 that I've watched )""Roma"" is rooted in realism and is a fitting ode to the country of his birth and the people who shaped his life.It's a well deserved Oscar for direction,cinematography and film in a foreign language.",Roma

1146,charleswatherston,"Massively over-rated, terrible script - an exercise in pure frustration",2,3 March 2019,"Mild spoilers - although given this film had barely any plot, that doesn't mean much!This is the first review I've been moved to write on imdb, because I've never seen such a massively over-rated film in all my life. For the first 10-15 minutes I thought that it could have potential. It was certainly beautifully (if a little pretentiously) shot, and the character of Cleo seemed a sympathetic and relate-able protagonist. It took more than an hour of waiting in vain for something to happen, before it began to slowly dawn on me that it never would.The film is far too long, with massively over-indulgent lingering shots throughout.
However, my biggest complaint was the script, it became clear the writers has decided to entirely abandon every convention which normally makes a story compelling: no character development, virtually no dramatic tension (and what little there was seemed quickly forgotten) and no plot resolution or catharsis. It was as though the writers had a load of ideas, but instead of properly developing a few good ones they just threw scraps of them all into the film and hoped they'd hang together.For the entire length of the film, every time there seemed to be some potential for drama or character development the scene would simply change. For example (here comes the mild spoiler), at one point a forest fire starts near to the house where the main characters are staying. ""Fire!"" shout the men outside and everyone grabs buckets of water and rushes to deal with it. An opportunity for dramatic tension, I think! What's going to happen? Is someone going to get hurt? Maybe one of the children runs away? Possibly while everyone is distracted that groper guy will try to rape the mother? Nope - a man wearing some weird costume stands 'every so artistically' in front of the camera (with the fire beautifully framing him, of course) and starts...singing? Then, with no context or explanation he wandered away and.... Bam! Scene cuts to the children playing football somewhere and sometime entirely different. Fire never mentioned again. No explanation, no context, no development of plot or character just on to the next thing... You learn literally NOTHING about any of the characters throughout - not even the protagonist!Wrong! Just plain bad, flat writing of the worst kind! I give it 2 instead of 1 because one can't deny it looked nice, but the script barely better than The Room, with none of the charm of spoon photos!",Roma
