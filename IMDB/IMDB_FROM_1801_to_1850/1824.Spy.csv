0,MartinHafer,Better than I expected!,7,23 August 2016,"I ever had any intention of watching this film but decided to after my oldest daughter convinced me to give it a try. After all, Melissa McCarthy has made a few films that just irritated me and I was not in the mood for more of the same. Fortunately, while the film is far from perfect, it surprised me and McCarthy didn't play just another buffoon.When the film begins, a super agent for the CIA (Jude Law) is in the middle of an important mission while his assistant, Susan (McCarthy), stays back at the base, as usual, watching and assisting him. He's somehow hooked up to some sort of closed circuit television and much of the success of his missions seems to be the result of Susan's very quick thinking. However, this one does NOT go well and the agency is soon having a funeral for the guy....and the nuclear weapon they were trying to recover is still out there. And, the woman who has it seems more than willing to sell it to the highest bidder. However, they can't just send in agents to get her and the weapon, as the vicious lady with the bomb knows the identities of all of the field agents...so they need someone unknown to find her. And, since Susan is unknown outside the CIA, she might just be able to do the mission...though the folks at the agency certainly have their doubts.In many ways I liked this film. Much of it was because of Susan. She was NOT a typical character. Sure, she had a few dopey moments but McCarthy was not playing yet another stereotypical 'fat broad'. Instead, she was often extremely clever, resourceful and even, dare I say, macho! I actually would mind seeing a sequel with this inexperienced but competent agent. I also liked some of the characters--particularly Susan's assistant as well as the crazy bald agent and the Italian guy. See the film and you'll see what I mean. Unfortunately, the film did have a few problems. Too often, while generally a very intelligent film, it also too often took the low road with ample jokes about feces, hemorrhoids, vomit and incredibly crude language. With less of this and more of the super agent stuff, you'd have had a much better film...though, on balance, it's still well worth your time.",Spy
1,Leofwine_draca,Appallingly unfunny,3,25 February 2019,"SPY is another appalling outing from Melissa McCarthy and Paul Feig; the actor and director also made GHOSTBUSTERS, which I had the misfortune to watch and quickly forget about afterwards. This one's a broad (what else?) spy spoof in which McCarthy's character goes from office worker to super-spy in the space of an hour. It's another mix of mindless cliche and supposedly sharp dialogue between the principal characters, dialogue which just offers crudity without wit. McCarthy's foul-mouthed lead is consistently unfunny and randomly goes from bumbling buffoon in the first hour to genuine super-spy at the climax (with the copious aid of a stunt double, of course). Miranda Hart is embarrassingly bad as the sidekick, while other actors are wasted. I only watched this for Jason Statham, who's amusing enough riffing on his action man persona, but he's not enough.",Spy
2,SnoopyStyle,some big laughs,7,3 April 2016,"Susan Cooper (Melissa McCarthy) is a skilled CIA support operator for agent Bradley Fine (Jude Law). She works in the vermin-infested basement with the rest of the support staff. Rayna Boyanov (Rose Byrne) has stolen a nuclear bomb. Fine is killed by Rayna and she has the identity of all the agents. Deputy director Elaine Crocker (Allison Janney) decides to send in the unknown Cooper to track weapons dealer Sergio De Luca (Bobby Cannavale). Agent Rick Ford (Jason Statham) goes rogue to find the nuke himself. With the help of fellow support staff Nancy and creepy local Aldo, Susan has to exceed her mandate when Ford's presence is detected and her assignment becomes impossible.This is a fun film from Paul Feig. Melissa McCarthy pulls back her manic behavior a little to bring a more balanced character. There are a couple of wackier characters that form fun comedy duos with her. The best is Statham. His ridiculousness is hilarious and their exchanges are gut-busting. It's fun whenever these other characters put her down. The last act loses some comedic steam. There is a need to wrap up the dramatic story but it could have been done simpler and with more comedy. Overall, it's a fun time with lots of big laughs.",Spy
3,boblipton,Very Funny,10,5 November 2021,"Sometimes, when you can't get the right woman, a man can do the job. While people complained with logic that there were no women directors, and no feminist movies,Paul Feig went along directing hilarious feminist tracts like this one.Melissa McCarthy has talent, but her vehicles have not always been great. However, this burlesque of spy movies had me laughing so much I never had the chance to recognize the recognize the inevitable idiotic end twist. That's a great popcorn movie effect. Jason Statham continues to impress me. He is a performer with almost no range, but place him right in his comfort zone and he can be a great comic actor.",Spy
4,nogodnomasters,I WISH I HAD MORE BULLETS,8,26 November 2018,"Based upon the success of ""The Heat"" a film role was written for Melissa McCarthy. I think everyone knows the plot where a desk jockey agent goes into the field with expected results. Jason Statham, while having a minor role, provided laughs with his serious description of impossible spy antics.Many scenes were spy film spoofs. The film teetered on cheese, not knowing whether it should venture there or not. The main problem I had with this film, is that I kept mentally comparing it to ""The Heat"" and frankly, ""The Heat"" was funnier. The film is worth seeing, but there is nothing spectacular about the cinematography that demands it be seen on the large scene.Guide: Excessive F-bombs. No sex. Brief male nudity.",Spy
5,kosmasp,I guess we got a lot of paid reviews here,9,11 July 2015,"That's according to one other reviewer who states that anyone who loves film would not rate this higher than one star. And while our taste in movies is different and comedy is something that will be viewed differently by anyone watching, I think it's a big mistake calling out people and suggesting things like that.In other words: Whether you liked this or not, it doesn't mean people who disagree with you got paid or have no sense of humor. Having said and written all that, I think Melissa McCarthy is doing a great job. And as a friend of mine said (though I did like ""The Heat"" with her and Sandra Bullock too), this one steps up on the stunts front too. There are some genuine great action scenes in this.And Jason Statham is terrific in spoofing himself (to put it PG words, something you won't get in this movie by the way - there's a reason it's rated R and it's mostly because of the language used). But in general this is really a movie about women. And I love the fact, that they are getting some really good well written roles in this. You might not agree with the lines/humor, but you can't fault the fact, that they put them out there taking lead and being really good at it.To tell you the truth, I'm almost surprised nobody called out ""Feminism"" with this one (something that seems to be popular in 2015, see also Mad Max Fury Road). But if you don't mind (and you shouldn't), and this kind of does meet your sense of humor, you will have a great time",Spy
6,Sleepin_Dragon,"I really enjoyed it, well made and very funny.",8,7 February 2016,"Susan Cooper works as a deskbound CIA agent, she's the mouth piece for her field agent Bradley Fine, but when he is killed by a beautiful femme fatale Rayna Boyanov, she agrees to go undercover as Carol Jenkins and take her down, her initial Mission leads her to Paris, where she needs to take a bomb away from a Crime group including Boyanov. Ably assisted by colleague and friend Nancy, she has to show her metal.This and Kingsman were movies that I was desperate to watch, I must say I loved them both, hopefully this will start a new wave of James Bond inspired comedies. Funny from start to finish, I absolutely loved it, it felt similar to Kingsman if I'm being honest, The most random moment of all was seeing that Ukranian Eurovision song contest entry from a few years back, never thought I'd ever be seeing that again!Melissa McCarthy has ridiculously good comic timing, she is naturally funny, and her genius is put to great use in this film, a truly hilarious woman, she manages to be funny and totally lovable too. Miranda Hart was an unexpected treat, very funny, adding a different slant to the humour as Nancy. Jason Statham was utterly brilliant, he always plays the same type of character, wonderful to see him sending himself up.Just a fun movie you can watch and re-watch. 8/10",Spy
7,jboothmillard,Spy,7,4 July 2015,"When I first heard about this comedy film, I have admit, despite, good names in the cast, I was sceptical, because most of these kinds of films can be predictable in material or story lines, but with good reviews I was going to give it a chance, directed by Paul Feig (Bridesmaids). Basically unassuming desk-bound CIA analyst Susan Cooper (Melissa McCarthy) and the unsung hero behind the agency's most dangerous missions, most often guiding her partner Agent Bradley Fine (Jude Law). But on a mission, involving a suitcase nuclear bomb, Fine falls off the grid and ends up killed, Rick Ford (Jason Statham) is the top agent suitable to take over the mission, but Susan volunteers to become a field agent as the identities of several agents have been leaked, her boss Elaine Crocker (Juno's Allison Janney) agrees, and Ford quits in disgust. Susan goes undercover to spy on the targets who have connections to the stolen suitcase, posing under a given false identity, or two, her best friend, fellow CIA analyst Nancy B. Artingstall (Miranda Hart) becomes her occasional guide, suave Italian informant Aldo (Peter Serafinowicz) is her contact, and she is irritated that Ford is also around trying to complete the mission as a rogue agent. Susan manages to get especially close to and gain the trust of Rayna Boyanov (Insidious's Rose Byrne), after saving her from an assassination attempt, Rayna may be have connections or be in cahoots with deadly arms dealers who will want to buy the weapon. Susan follows the many leads within Rayna's empire and ends up chasing, and being chased, by various assassins and double agents, and Nancy shows up as well, but what she did not count on was the return of Fine, he faked his death to gain intelligence about the bomb's location by becoming Rayna's lover. In the end the true terrorists are brought out and defeated, with a little help from rapper Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson, Rayna is arrested, and Crocker and Ford praise Susan for being a reliable agent. Also starring Bobby Cannavale as Sergio De Luca, Morena Baccarin as Karen Walker and Die Another Day's Will Yun Lee as Timothy Cress. McCarthy made her name in Bridesmaids, and proves herself as a leading actress and movie star, Statham is amusing as the agent who thinks he's better than anyone, Law is funny as the wannabe James Bond with an American accent, Byrne is good at playing the bratty rich bitch, and Hart, Serafinowicz and Janney get their moments as well. The funniest moments are McCarthy bumbling around and having bad reactions to death, and the many name-calling sequences between her and Byrne, and the chase and guns blazing sequences are surprisingly exciting, it is a most entertaining comedy action movie. Very good!",Spy
8,moonspinner55,She's gonna pump that s*** until it pops...,2,28 April 2016,"Popular but witless, lunkheaded action-comedy star-vehicle for Melissa McCarthy, whose reign as the female Adam Sandler shows no signs of slowing down—her budgets keep getting bigger, yet her f-bomb-heavy scripts are growing dimmer. McCarthy plays CIA employee Susan Cooper, a desk-jockey and one-time promising trainee, whose crush on a field agent gets her involved in his latest life-and-death case concerning the daughter of an arms dealer who's in-cahoots with terrorists. McCarthy's shtick—the withering barrage of ego-deflating put-downs peppered with expletives—still gets laughs, but here the comedienne is nearly swallowed up by the ridiculously complicated plot and busy direction, both of which are more exhausting than hilarious. Writer-director Paul Feig obviously adores his star—and, indeed, the picture would be absolutely nothing without her—but surrounding McCarthy with snipers and bombs (of the exploding variety) or putting her in a ""Kill Bill""-styled fight scene probably sounded a lot better than it plays out. Supporting cast, including Jason Statham, Jude Law, Rose Byrne, Allison Janney and 50 Cent (!), looks properly embarrassed; Miranda Hart, playing an overeager nerd, shows some comedic flair but doesn't have the funny lines to put her role over. * from ****",Spy
9,blanche-2,Melissa McCarthy as a spy,6,10 October 2015,"I read a few reviews of this - the reviews I read were all negative, citing dumbing down and vulgarity. I don't understand what's so new about that. And one person claimed to be a huge fan of Melissa McCarthy's. I'm a big fan of Melissa McCarthy as well. I think she is super-talented. But her movies, at least the ones I've seen, are usually dumbed down and vulgar.I found this one not as offensive as some others of hers I've seen, and with more quality scenes. At least here she didn't portray some crude slob. Here she's an agent, Susan, who helps an agent in the field (Jude Law) by watching wherever he is on computer and telling him if someone is sneaking up behind him etc. They're a good team. She's in love with him. They seem to be friends, although he's a user. Without giving anything away, Susan winds up an agent in the field when it's learned that a nuclear bomb is being purchased. She is only to find and report, but she takes it further and winds up coming up against the vicious Rayna Boyanov (Rose Byrne).The undercover outfits Susan is given to wear are hilarious. And the hotel she is sent to - a real hole. McCarthy is good, showing a little more vulnerability in this than she did in the last film I saw her in, and she looks great with the rayon short curly wig and the cat t-shirt off. She's a very pretty woman, and some of her lines are quite funny.Jude Law is Bradley and he's swoon worthy. He's slick and smooth, and one can easily see a woman without a lot of man experience falling for him and his easy flirtation - done with an agenda, of course.Rose Byrne - I loved her on Damages, and she does a wonderful job here as the villainous Rayna - cool, snobby, insulting, and dangerous. Miranda Hart has a great turn as Nancy, the woman watching Susan as she's out in the field. A good role for the British comedienne. She and McCarthy worked well together.The best part and the best lines belong to Jason Statham, who plays a hyper agent who doesn't want Susan in the field and stalks her. The character claims to have done preposterous things -- ""I jumped out of a window with only a raincoat as a parachute. I broke both legs..."" ""I saw the woman I loved pushed out of a plane and then hit by another plane."" He has a habit of showing up at odd times.There were some funny scenes, and I found it entertaining. What I liked is that McCarthy played a somewhat overweight, pretty, insecure woman who lacks confidence. I hate her fat slob with a foul mouth portrayals, which I find demeaning. However, there were plenty of foul mouths and low humor to be had, but with a good cast and fun stuff in between.",Spy
10,tavm,Spy was quite an entertaining espionage thriller-comedy,8,8 June 2015,"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. He thought it was mostly okay while I thought it was mostly funny due to the constant pop culture references sprinkled throughout the movie. Lots of uses of the f-word probably also contributed to my laughing a lot and maybe some of the physical stunts of which most seemed pretty serious. Written and directed by Paul Feig and starring Melissa McCarthy-both having previously teamed for Heat, I thought this was both humorous enough and a little suspenseful to keep one on its toes. And despite my mentioning the use of a certain word, this wasn't as vulgar as one feared. So on that note, I highly recommend Spy. P.S. This was the second film in a row I saw both Rose Byrne and Bobby Cannavale sometimes sharing scenes, the other being the recent Annie remake.",Spy
11,edwagreen,***,7,2 April 2016,"There is plenty of action here in this James Bond-like takeoff and Melissa McCarthy just proves what a heavy set woman can do when pressed into service.I loved the helicopter and plane scenes and the car chases were just as good.As a CIA who goes into active service following the supposed murder of an agent she adored, Jude Law, McCarthy is fun to watch here. Not funny is the constant vulgarity. Jason Stratham, a British agent, who supposedly resigned but keeps showing up, can't get through a sentence without that major profanity word. It really hurts this picture.After the Bond-like opening sequence, the credits roll and we hear a take-off of Shirley Bassey's Goldfinger. It's not that song but it reminded me of it.There is plenty of duplicity and double dealing in this caper. What are we led to believe in the end regarding McCarthy's sexual orientation?",Spy
12,michaelRokeefe,Secret Agent spoof! Funny or awfully funny?,4,5 November 2015,"Unassuming analyst for the CIA, Susan Cooper(Melissa McCarthy),has her wildest dreams come true as she volunteers to go undercover in this James Bond spoof. Susan has worked diligently with her partner Bradley Fine(Jude Law), tracking and guiding him on his missions. When Fine is either killed or just missing in action, Miss Cooper is the only agent(on paper)that has not had their identity compromised by an international arms dealer's organization. The improbable assignment has a tenured agent Rick Ford(Jason Statham)resign in disgust. But his jealousy and ego will have him try to spoil Cooper's investigation and search for the missing agent and find the location of the arms dealer.Some heavy action along with situational and sight gags. Plenty of foul language that at times is too much and off-putting. I do have to admit I found a role by McCarthy I actually liked. She by all means is not your typical image of a leading lady.(Matter of opinion of course). Statham's role is nothing for him to be very proud of.Rounding out the cast: Raad Rawl, Rose Byrne, Sam Richardson, Miranda Hart, Jessica Chaffin and Allison Janney.",Spy
13,Theo Robertson,Hitchens Was Right - Women Are So Not Funny,2,9 June 2015,"My favourite person over the last decade has been the late Christopher Hitchens . Divisive , polemical and explosively controversial he was best known for taking on the men of God and constantly winning in his own take no prisoners style . One almost forgotten polemic is his Vanity Fair rebuttal that ""Women are not funny"" . Suffice to say I didn't disagree with this opinion and do recall getting in to something of a heated internet debate on this . No hard feelings on my part because it's just the internet and isn't all that important but I still stand by with what I said in that I don't find women funny and SPY does absolutely nothing to change my mind and that Hitchens is right It's interesting that much of the marketing material in Britain has made a big deal about SPY starring well known names of Statham , Law and Byrne . A clever marketing ploy because Melissa McCarthy will be treated with blank expressions and mutterings of ""Who ? "" . After seeing SPY all I can say is her relative obscurity this side of the Atlantic is well deserved and hope it continues for a lifetime . Ms McCarthy is chubby , unattractive and SPY uses her as a star vehicle to deconstruct the James Bond franchise and all those other espionage thrillers . She also constantly puts her metaphorical foot in it , swears a lot and is probably even more unfunny than the other 3.5 billion woman walking on the face of Planet Earth today . That is really saying something believe meThis is a pity because as a spy spoof SP works relatively well . I saw the straight laced , po faced SURVIVOR last week and truth be told I probably had more fun watching SPY than I did watching that . The espionage element is fairly well done , tough you have to suspend disbelief that a cutie played by Byrne would be in league with the murderous misogynists of Al Qaeda but you're not supposed to take things seriously here , and Jude Law and Jason Statham have a whale of a time sending themselves up , a fact that they're able to communicate to the audience and I wonder if this has everything to do with SPY being popular with critics ? .Regardless of this SPY suffers from being a comedy vehicle for someone who simply is not funny",Spy

15,CinemaSerf,Fish out water that flounders somewhat.,6,7 October 2021,"This starts off as a straight rip off of James Bond - with Jude Law, whom for a while was in the running for that part, doing all the derring-do and Melissa McCarthy as his CIA handler. When things go a bit pear shaped, however, she is promoted by the somewhat sceptical Allison Janney (""Crocker"") and assigned the task of getting to the bottom of things and, of course, stopping global thermo-nuclear destruction... The first fifteen minutes or so are quite promising, but thereafter it really just becomes the Melissa McCarthy show. If you are fan, then watch on. I'm not really, so I felt my interest waning quickly - her performance is adequate but the humour lacks any semblance of subtlety or style: it's all just too blunt and even slightly crude. Rose Byrne (looking a little like Jane Seymour, I thought) is the rather elegant, but unconvincing baddie and Jason Statham appears now and again to deliver some rather banal, expletive ridden, contributions that are supposed to be amusing, but for me fell really quite flat - as, indeed, did the whole thing as it lurched towards a conclusion that is a very poor relation of ""Austin Powers"". Two hours stretches the joke far too thinly and the ending is just a bit silly. Watchable, but could have been much better.",Spy
16,writers_reign,Battled In Bond,5,14 June 2015,"I read some of the reviews posted here both before and after watching the movie and tend to come down more on the side of the negatives than the positives. I saw Melissa McCarthy in her two previous films and quite liked her, I've seen Miranda Hart on English TV and quite like her, too, so I figured what the hey, let's give it a whirl. For reasons not explained in the script Miranda Hart retains her English accent despite working for the CIA in the US. At times I got the impression she was allowed to write her own dialogue as well for there's more than a trace of her quirky style in evidence. In terms of chemistry however, M and M are about as tight as oil and water. I'm certainly not against James Bond type spoofs but Derek Flint (James Coburn) and Matt Helm (Dean Martin) have already been there, done that and got the tee shirts. Not exactly a waste of two hours but neither a Eureka! moment.",Spy
17,zardoz-13,McCarthy's Role of a Lifetime!!!,9,8 June 2015,"""Unaccompanied Minors"" director Paul Feig has been grooming plus-sized actress Melissa McCarthy for the big time since he cast her as the loquacious, scene-stealing, puppy-napper in ""Bridesmaids."" Meantime, when she isn't co-starring in her prime-time CBS-TV series ""Mike and Molly,"" McCarthy has been landing bigger roles. She was hilarious in ""Identity Thief"" with Jason Bateman, and she held her own with superstar Sandra Bullock in Feig's female police partner yarn ""The Heat."" In those movies, McCarthy proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that she had USDA approved comedic chops. Nevertheless, she has confined herself to playing second fiddle roles like those reserved for ""Hangover"" star Zach Galifianakis. Indeed, McCarthy amounts to a female equivalent of Galifianakis. Although it was a stab at stardom, ""Tammy"" found McCarthy confining herself to a similar Galifianakis role, except her name appeared above the title. If anybody doubted the stout star's ability to shuffle off her comedic coil and play it straight, they need only observe her in the superlative Bill Murray art-house comedy ""St. Vincent"" where she restrained herself and shined all the brighter for her discretionary efforts. Now, in Feig's sixth film ""Spy,"" McCarthy has finally arrived. Watching ""Spy"" is like watching the evolution of cinematic comedy. If this audacious, but formulaic espionage spoof doesn't solidify McCarthy's status as the first fat lady of laughter, nothing will. (Think about it. Has Hollywood ever given a big gal a shot at superstardom?) She is the whole show, not the sidekick or the scene stealer! ""Spy"" represents the zenith of McCarthy's career as a leading lady. Mind you, she is still a big gal, but from now on she will be THE BIG GAL, and everybody will be strumming second fiddle to her.As forty-something, deskbound, CIA analyst Susan Cooper, McCarthy toils tirelessly without recognition from a vermin-infested basement in Langley, Virginia. She makes it possible for one of the top field agents, Bradley Fine (Jude Law of ""Cold Mountain""), to survive perils galore. In a snappy opening shoot'em up sequence set in faraway Bulgaria, the debonair Fine, decked out like a dapper James Bond, dodges an army of gunmen while he searches for a dastardly villain who has stolen a tactical nuclear bomb. Cooper serves as Fine's liaison. Communicating via satellite by means of high-tech surveillance equipment consisting of an earpiece and a tiny contact lens camera that Fine sports, Susan provides him with death-defying reconnaissance. She warns him where his adversaries lurk, charts evasion routes, and feeds him on the spot information about anything he encounters during a mission. Together, nobody can thwart them. Not surprisingly, Susan has an obvious crush on her attractive colleague. Eventually, Bradley confronts his chief adversary, Eastern European arms dealer Tihomir Boyanov (Raad Rawi of ""Traitor""), and threatens to shoot him. Refusing to reveal the whereabouts of the nuke, Boyanov calls Bradley's bluff. Unfortunately for Boyanov, Bradley suffers an attack of hay fever that makes him sneeze so that he accidentally shoots Tihomir in the head. Later, Bradley renews his hunt. This time he pursues Boyanov's haughty daughter Rayna (Rose Byrne of ""Bridesmaids"") but she gets the drop on Bradley and kills him. Naturally, Susan has a ringside seat for this startling occasion and watches in disbelief as Rayna murders Bradley.Predictably, Susan's superior, CIA Deputy Director Elaine Crocker (Allison Janney of ""Juno""), finds herself in a fix because the opposition knows the identities of her surviving field agents. This doesn't deter brash, loud-mouthed Rick Ford (Jason Statham of ""The Transporter"" movies) from demanding that Crocker assign him to the case with a different face. Mistakenly, Ford believes the CIA possesses a miracle machine that enables agents to change their faces, like John Travolta did in the 1997 John Woo extravaganza ""Face/Off,"" so he can save the day. Livid that everybody has lied to him about such a gizmo, Ford storms out, and Crocker decides reluctantly to send Susan out into the field to follow Rayna and locate the bomb. Susan is dying to play spy, but Crocker saddles her with a variety of unflattering aliases that take advantage of her frumpy figure. Nevertheless, despite these derisive disguises, Susan embarks on a European outing that takes her from Paris to Rome and finally to Budapest. Not only does she manage to track down the wicked Rayna, but she also fools her into believing she has gone rogue. Later, she finds an elusive Al Qaeda-oriented terrorist, Sergio De Luca (Bobby Cannavale of ""Snakes on a Plane""), who wants to blow up New York City with the nuke. Along the way, Susan runs afoul of Ford. He claims he is shadowing her to save her life, but she winds up saving his life. The best fight scene in ""Spy"" has Susan contending with an indestructible female adversary, Kia (Nargis Fakhri), who doesn't flinch even after our heroine shoves a knife through one of her hands. Susan winds up commandeering motor scooters, cars, jets, and a helicopter to preserve civilization from the enemy.Undoubtedly, brawny action star Jason Statham delivers the second best performance. Nothing prevents him from ridiculing his own tough guy persona with a heretofore unbelievable sense of abandon. Statham is shameless as McCarthy's egotistical counterpart. Nothing in Statham's cinematic resume will prepare you for his madcap antics. Indeed, this is the farthest afield the buzz-cut British actor has gone with his image, especially after his wicked villainy in ""Furious 7."" As Susan's CIA basement colleague Nancy B. Artingstall, British actress Miranda Hart of the ""Call the Midwife"" television series knows how to steal scenes, too. Basically, nobody gives a bad performance in this exhilarating action comedy. Furthermore, writer & director Paul Feig doesn't pull any punches. Characters get their heads blown off in halos of blood, and politically incorrect laughs ensue. Feig stages several bullet-riddled shootouts, and McCarthy gets to beat the stuffing out of several, robust ruffians. Altogether, ""Spy"" qualifies as a riotous saga with McCarthy dominating the shenanigans.",Spy
18,oscaralbert,Better than most of the recent James Bond flicks . . .,9,18 June 2015,". . . SPY makes a strong case for the Bond 25 Project to feature an Agent 007 answering to ""Jane,"" as in ""Jane Bond."" Though Sony Corporation is working overtime to undermine American values and destroy the U.S., this Trojan Horse legacy of WWII war criminal Tojo may well see England's Bond Legend as appropriate ""collateral damage,"" since Britain fancies herself to be our ""Mother Country."" David Niven was Bond creator Ian Fleming's first choice to play James, but only portrayed Agent 007 in a spoof (the first film version of CASINO ROYALE). Now, Melissa McCarthy can do a Reverse Niven with a one-and-a-half-tuck, moving from Bond parody to actually becoming THE Eon Bond. Ms. McCarthy already has worked with a bevy of potential Bond Boys in SPY, headlined by Jude Law and Jason Statham. No doubt she'd be eager to emulate Christian Bale's diet in his run-up to THE MACHINIST, and appear at the famous Bond Sound Stage rail thin. But Roger Moore was no light-weight, so perhaps all MM needs to do it to remind the Bond 25 costume designer that ""clothes make the woman."" Ms. McCarthy could hardly be a worse Bond than George Lazenby (with his skirts and ruffled frilly shirts) in ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE.",Spy

Hilarious high-concept action comedy with drab, CIA drone McCarthy (a stitch beginning to end) who steps forward to be in the field when a botched assist with her fellow agent Law causes her guilt to unleash a heroic streak a mile wide. Director Paul Feig - who also penned the profanity laced yet hysterical screenplay - reunites with McCarthy, and co-star Byrne as the bitchy villianness whose vulgarity is only matched by her killer fashion tastes (love the 'do!) while the vehicle built steadily for its star is tailor-made and a complete hoot. Statham has fun aping his action hero egoism by being in-on-the japes and jokes with a deadly dead-pan and no-nonsense embellishments of his feats of strength. Tall-drink-of-water Hart steals the film as the British cohort of McCarthy's with a visual of Mutt & Jeff teaming of par excellence, and Serafinowicz' libidinous Italian colleague is a laugh riot all to himself.",Spy

There is actually a decent plot, so there is much to enjoy here.And, for me, the vast majority of that enjoyment was buried under the industrial quantities of profanity which lace this film. The first 5 minutes or so is clear, then the F-bombs start and are constant until the very end. And they are unnecessary. Pretty nearly every one of them adds nothing to the film: if they did, I wouldn't find them so objectionable. For me, they spoiled an otherwise very enjoyable film.",Spy
21,evanston_dad,Melissa McCarthy Undercover,7,23 December 2015,"I can totally understand why Melissa McCarthy may be an acquired taste that many people never develop, but I liked her in this and thought the film was pretty good, landing more laughs than it fumbles. McCarthy is joined by Jude Law (very good), Rose Byrne (less successful), and Jason Statham, who refreshingly gets to flex his comedic muscles for a change playing a parody of himself. But the standout for me was the one actor who I'd never seen before, Miranda Hart as McCarthy's nerdy and ill-equipped right-hand (wo)man. Paul Feig, who directed McCarthy to her Oscar nomination in ""Bridesmaids,"" does directing honors here as well.Grade: A-",Spy
22,ferguson-6,In the ear,6,10 June 2015,"Greetings again from the darkness. Melissa McCarthy and writer/director Paul Feig are back together in hopes of recapturing their Bridesmaids comedy and box office magic. They are also re-teaming for next year's all-female Ghostbusters remake.This time it's a parody of James Bond films ... right down to the elaborate and creative opening credit sequence. Recognizing that combining action and comedy can be a bit challenging, Feig enlists the help of Jason Statham and Jude Law. Statham parodies his well known uber-intense characters with a running dialogue of his bravery and heroism, while Law is clearly having a blast as the ultra-smooth agent Bradley Fine (think Pierce Brosnan's Bond).In spite of the gentlemen, this is Ms. McCarthy's film and she is believable as the frumpy CIA analyst who is the ""voice in the ear"" of super agent Fine (Law). He maneuvers the front line of dangerous assignments as she provides life-saving high-tech guidance from the relative safety of the vermin-infested basement CIA lab. Of course, we know McCarthy's agent will end up in the field in her attempts to avenge a mission gone wrong.It's McCarthy in the field that will either make or break the film for you. Her scenes with Rose Byrne and Peter Serafinowicz worked best for me, while her Jackie Chan-style kitchen fight scene and her chase scenes were a bit more difficult to buy off on. It can be confusing as a viewer when we are constantly bombarded with PC rules, and then Feig and McCarthy don't hesitate to use her heft for laughs.Other supporting work is provided by British comedienne Miranda Hunt, another fish out of water agent; Morena Baccarin as a strutting super agent at the level of Statham; Bobby Cannavale as a would-be terrorist; and Allison Janney as the CIA Supervisor. While each have their moments, it's McCarthy's visit to the spy gadget department that provides the best laughs.The Action-Comedy-Spy Thriller genre is pretty sparse, and as you may expect, comedy is the priority for most scenes. McCarthy does well in her first true film lead, though my prediction is that her value as an actress will ultimately come from playing characters who are more ""real"" - like her role in last year's St. Vincent.",Spy
23,anaconda-40658,Spy on McCarthy.,8,15 June 2015,"Spy (2015): Dir: Paul Feig / Cast: Melissa McCarthy, Jason Statham, Jude Law, Rose Byrne, Miranda Hart: Entertaining spy comedy about elevating the least amongst us to higher positions. After success with Bridesmaids and The Heat Paul Feig teams up with Melissa McCarthy in what can be best described as their best so far. McCarthy plays Susan Cooper who works at a spy agency where she feeds information off her computer into an ear piece to assist agents on the field. Central plot regards a nuclear bomb that only one person can detect. Since the villain knows the identity of all the agents, only Cooper can go undetected. One of the film's best running jokes is the unflattering disguises Cooper is subjected to. McCarthy endures the physical slapstick violence with awkward perfection including a massive battle in a kitchen where she swings a mean frying pan. Rose Byrne plays villain Rayna Boyanov whom Cooper connects with and must protect in order to discover the whereabouts of the bomb. Byrne is at her best during an intense flight gone wrong. Jude Law plays agent Bradley Fine who, with Cooper's assistance, makes a narrow escape after accidentally killing the father of the Boyanov character. Cooper shows him affection that is not returned quite as she hoped. Jason Statham is hilarious as agent Rick Ford, a hot head who believes that Cooper will screw up the mission all the while she constantly saves his ass. Miranda Hart plays Cooper's ear piece contact who eventually tackles rapper 50 Cent in order to cause a diversion. Climax is overblown to pointless levels yet McCarthy takes being a spy beyond the realms of normal. Score: 8 / 10",Spy
24,FlashCallahan,Does he know its a lake?.....,7,9 July 2015,"CIA analyst Susan Cooper has spent her entire career as a desk jockey, working hand-in- hand with agent Bradley Fine. Using high-tech equipment and a hidden earpiece, Susan is the guardian angel who helps Bradley avoid danger, but Susan yearns to be with him on these dangerous mission, a true agent. When Bradley is assassinated by Bulgarian arms dealer Rayna Boyanov, Susan wrangles her way into her first undercover assignment to help capture Boyanov and avenge Bradley.......It's third time lucky for Feig and McCarthy, and although she has a wonderful screen presence, this could have been the same character from The Heat, or even Bridesmaids, as her profane schtick seems to be her calling card.It's the support though that really make the film what it is. Law shows that he could have been a major contender for a certain British agent, Byrne excels as the spoilt villainess of the film, and then there was Statham.It's brilliant to know that he can send him self up the way he does, and quite a relief to know that all his action roles before this always had that knowing wink from him, as this proves that he has a wonderful sense of humour. Schwarzeneggar aside, could you see any other seasoned action star send themselves up the way Statham does in this?.As well as a successfully high ratio of jokes fired from the gag cannon, Feig also knows how to conduct a genuinely thrilling set piece, which only benefits the rest of the film.A few times during the film, it did remind me of True Lies a little, especially the opening, but if you've seen that movie, that's only more of a compliment.It's not going to be remembered as a classic in years to come, but it's a fun, action packed comedy, that does supply you with genuine belly laughs on more than a few occasions...",Spy
25,namashi_1,Flat Out Hilarious!,9,8 July 2015,"'Spy' is the kind of film, that you'd recommend to anyone who likes to laugh. It's a terrific action-comedy, that is high on energy, humour & entertainment. I don't remember laughing so hard in a film in such a long time, as much as I did while watching 'Spy'. 'Spy' Synopsis: A desk-bound CIA analyst volunteers to go undercover to infiltrate the world of a deadly arms dealer, and prevent diabolical global disaster.Oozing James Bond/Pink Panther fanaticism, 'Spy' is a thoroughly enjoyable joyride that delivers even more than what's expected from it. Writer-Director Paul Feig is in top-form! His Screenplay is packed with superbly done jokes & the narrative moves at a brisk pace. A special mention for the undeniably crude, yet funny dialogue. His Direction, on the other-hand, is excellent. Cinematography is lavish. Editing is razor-sharp. Art & Costume Design are flawless. Action-Sequences are impressively executed, as well. Performance-Wise: Melissa McCarthy is extraordinary. The supremely talented actress delivers a superior comedic performance, that definitely ranks amongst her best to date. Rose Byrne is top-notch. Her comic timing is simply fantastic. Jason Statham sportingly spoofs himself & brings the house down on numerous occasions. Jude Law is efficient in a cameo. Miranda Hart is outstanding. She stands out. Bobby Cannavale is decent. Allison Janney shines, as always. Nargis Fakhri is winsome in her bit. On the whole, 'Spy' is flat out hilarious! The Comedy of the Summer!",Spy
26,StevePulaski,Formula breeding contempt,4,7 June 2015,"Paul Feig's ""Spy"" continues to showcase the talents of Melissa McCarthy's admirably zealous performing abilities as an actress. Love her or hate her, McCarthy is a comic force of nature, breathlessly going from a mild and calm demeanor to a racier, more hot-headed temper in almost no time. ""Spy"" is best divided into two acts, separated by the hour mark, with the first hour showing McCarthy's mannered side while showing her unleash her fury during the second. It's quite an interesting mix, and provides for a rather unexpectedly reversal (""Spy"" wasn't really marketed on vulgarian principles like ""The Heat"" and ""Tammy"" were).However, there's less charming about ""Spy"" than I was ready to report. This is a film that simply shows the same brand of McCarthy humor we've seen before, unabashedly raunchy, sometimes to a fault, and burdened by a very hit or miss array of jokes along the way. Feig and McCarthy, yet again, seem to be spitballing ideas here, trying to find what works for her in the vein of physical comedy, dialog, and situational events and finding a ground that's more solid than the terribly loose ""Tammy"" but less appealing than the chemistry-driven ""Heat."" It's a hodgepodge of epic proportions in terms of the direction of its humor, along with being seriously confused about its presentation as an action-comedy.The story revolves around Melissa McCarthy's Susan Cooper, a CIA analyst/desk jockey who helps guide her fellow Agent Bradley Fine (Jude Law) on missions, watching his every move through computers and assisting him in compromising predicaments. The CIA is in search of a nuke bomb suitcase, and upon failing to recover it during Fine's efforts in Bulgaria and his subsequent death, Susan is sent undercover to find and identify Rayna Boyanov (Rose Byrne), the daughter of the man responsible for the nuke bomb suitcase. Susan is sent undercover because of fear that Rayna and her family are aware of the other spies in the CIA, like the pompous, know-it-all Rick Ford (Jason Statham), who quits in frustration upon Susan being allowed to partake in the mission. Susan's boss Elaine Crocker (Allison Janney) winds up agreeing to her mission, and before long, Susan becomes ""Penny Morgan,"" a middle-aged woman touring in Paris, working to get close to Rayna before the nuke bomb is detonated.We've seen these same tropes before in action films gone past, where there is some sort of fabled device up for grabs by numerous different parties and police are summoned or somebody is sent undercover. At first, ""Spy"" recognizes that it's essentially operating on well-charted territory and decides to toy with the general quips and clichés of the genre. However, just about the same time the script decides to amplify Melissa McCarthy's vulgarian tendencies, the film begins to play the same quips it was satirizing. We never really know whether or not we should be laughing with or at ""Spy,"" and that poses a big problem for the tone of the film.Again, McCarthy can be admirable at certain times in the film, but overall, there's a dreary sense of familiarity with her performances. We've seen McCarthy be the toughest woman on screen before and her characters have all run threadbare in terms of being able to be anything other than occasionally hard-headed or amiable to a fault. Between this and Feig trying to throw McCarthy into every comic situation possible (including some very unfunny and absurdly long scenes involving Peter Serafinowicz's character trying to molest Susan at every turn) and we just have another comedy trying way too hard to be funny.""Spy"" can, however, claim to have a very strong cast of supporting characters, specifically Byrne and Janney, both of whom do very capable work here. Byrne continues to explore her well-rounded, character actress principles, Janney delivers her wonderfully cold, deadpan humor, and Statham gives an innocuous performance that dreads carefully along the lines of self parody. But between ""Spy""'s identity crisis as a film, McCarthy's tired schtick (I long to see her work in a dramatic film, where I think she'd be wonderfully capable, perhaps pulling a Robin Williams-esque reversal on naysayers), and the inevitable muchness that begins to overtake the film as a whole and there's a lot burdening ""Spy"" that undermines the strong talent on display here.",Spy
27,lasttimeisaw,"Finally, we have a competent female agent to rule the box-office",7,8 June 2015,"After last summer's critics-panned squib TAMMY, which is not quite a financial disaster, but Melissa McCarthy's star power has inevitably been questioned whether her box-office draw can still maintain after her rotund figure and comedic shticks have been overly cashed in on these years. Thanks heaven SPY has arrived, a third collaboration with Paul Feig, and unites her with the criminally under-appreciated her BRIDESMAIDS (2011) co-star Rose Byrne, and under Feig's helm, together they concoct up a thoroughly hilarious spin-off of James Bond's spy trademark, with an overhaul of a female lead and in passing, finally fulfills Jude Law's yearning as a suited-up top agent after he lost the battle to Daniel Craig almost 10 years ago, and gives Jason Statham a rare opportunity to tease his own action hero stereotype. 2015 might be redeemed as a great year for the sexism Hollywood finally decide to do something about its biased sense of worth, after the equal-demand in Patricia Arquette's Oscar acceptance speech and its consequent waves from various upholders, we are gladly witnessing a certain change in the studio outputs, especially in blockbusters, where female roles are given more leeway and even challenge the usual male-exclusive formula, as in MAD MAX: FURY ROAD (2015). SPY comes headily with a sucker-punch to another male- dominant spy genre, and more daringly it puts Ms. MCarthy, a talented woman defies the conventional boundaries of objectifying woman through man's point-of-view, in the leading- lady chair, without making offensive jokes on her appearance. Instead, Susan Cooper (McCarthy), a self-effacing desk operator, proves to best CIA's top agents to complete a dangerous mission of an illegal nuclear weaponry trade. The main reason spurring Susan to work in the field is not the usual patriotism but the unrequited love for her off-the-grid partner Bradley Fine (Law), yet when the mission is accomplished and Fine is impressed by her heroism and invites her for a romantic dinner, she kindly refuses, my interpretation is that she doesn't want to ruin the picture of her Mr. Perfect since we are know things we cannot get is always the best. Instead, in the next scene, she sleeps with Rick Ford (Statham), the bigoted agent who constantly quarrels with her, dismisses her just because she is a woman and boosts himself for fabricated gallantry, leaving the dream guy in your imagination and hopping on to a more approachable but recalcitrant target, that is the attitude can solve all the mawkish tragedy in GONE WITH THE WIND (1939).Paul Feig writes the script all by himself and empowers women's roles in an all-out fashion, Byrne is a heartless villainess, a pampered daughter with wealth, cynical about everyone around her, but strikes up an unusual bond with the undercover agent Cooper, Byrne astounds with her sublime sneer and bitchiness. The British comedienne Miranda Hart is Nancy, Susan's best friend and college, their friendship weigh a lot in the film besides the duo's rib-tickling comic bent. McCarthy puts a demanding effort to excel all the action pieces, she is a marks-woman who can engage in physical combat, command a helicopter, even steer a nosediving plane (that is too far-fetched since it is only her first mission), and never retreat to be a wallflower, it is refreshing and encouraging to watch such a funny movie without getting offensive simultaneously by Hollywood's usual crassness and vulgarity, way to go the Feig-McCarthy pair, I'm looking forward to their GHOSTBUSTERS revamp next year!",Spy
28,KineticSeoul,"One of those movies that is cliché, but it's still fun!",7,7 June 2015,"So this movie is sort of a spoof for spy movies. And for the most part I had fun watching this flick. Now when it comes to the plot it's nothing special, but it's the direction they decided to go with it that added to it's entertainment value. I first decided to pass on this movie since the trailer wasn't all that appealing to me and I thought it was going to be another lame comedy. Until my friends started to talk about how humorous and fun it was. So I decided to check it out. Now this isn't one of the best comedy I seen, but it was still a bloody good time. And wasn't cheesy like I thought it would be. I don't want to come off mean nor is that my intention. But the title of this movie should have been ""Spy: It's funny Because She is Fat"". Because this movie revolves most of it's joke on how fat the protagonist is. The constant poke at the protagonist because of her appearance and the circumstances she gets into because of her weight, got a bit old for me. I mean if she was a skinny chick going on this mission, the movie wouldn't have any comedy value. Still for few parts I did find it humorous, I wasn't necessarily laughing through this movie. But I did find it a entertaining flick with few entertaining bantering between characters. The casts really made this movie work. Melissa McCarthy is again doing what she does in most of her movies. But then again most comedians play the same or similar character with different names over and over again. However she worked well in this flick, I guess the director really knows how to utilize her. Jude Law is once again playing the sleazy guy and Jason Statham plays this badass who does constant monologues about how badass he is. His character isn't that bright but is likable and slightly annoying at the same time. Overall this is a fun comedy that is actually worth seeing at the theater once.7.3/10",Spy
29,Hellmant,"An impressive addition to McCarthy, Feig and Statham's resumes!",8,11 June 2015,"'SPY': Four Stars (Out of Five)Melissa McCarthy and Paul Feig team up, for the third time (following 2011's 'BRIDESMAIDS' and 2013's 'THE HEAT'); for this action/comedy spy flick (simply titled 'SPY', appropriately). Feig wrote and directed the film and McCarthy plays a CIA agent, in it, on her first mission in the field; while trying to avenge the death of her partner (played by Jude Law). The movie also costars Jason Statham, Rose Byrne, Bobby Cannavale, Miranda Hart and Allison Janney. It's the third time Byrne and Cannavale, a real life couple, have costarred in a film together; it's also the second time Byrne, McCarthy and Feig have worked together (following 'BRIDESMAIDS'). I think it's well made and an impressive addition to McCarthy, Feig and Statham's resumes.McCarthy plays Susan Cooper; a CIA analyst that assists her partner, Bradley Fine (Law), while he's in the field; from a desk job, at the CIA USA office. When Fine is killed, by a possible terrorist target named Rayna Boyanov (Byrne), Cooper asks her superior, Elaine Crocker (Janney), to become a field agent to stop her. Due to the fact that other agents, like the insane Rick Ford (Statham), have been compromised, Crocker accepts Cooper's proposal. So Susan goes to Paris, to avenge her partner and stop a possible nuke deal.The film is full of witty, and pretty clever, comedy; mixed with well-executed action scenes (much like Feig and McCarthy's previous movie together). It's not quite as good as 'THE HEAT', due to the lack of classic buddy film chemistry (between McCarthy and Sandra Bullock, in the previous film), but McCarthy is really good in the movie; and Statham is a scene-stealer. The rest of the cast is more than adequate as well, but (as with 'BRIDESMAIDS') the movie is too long (at 2 hours) and poorly paced. It also has a lot of mean spirited, bully type, humor; aimed at McCarthy's character (and her appearance). Still the movie is funny, and action-packed enough.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/N95IMM6Vork",Spy
30,thesar-2,Spy Hard Laughing,9,5 September 2015,"Wow, this movie might very well compete for a good spot in my top five of 2015. I loved almost every minute of this fantastic comedy/spoof/action film. Lately, as much as I began loving Melissa McCarthy when she arrived on the scene, it actually takes some convincing as of late to see one of her films. Ever since she took over the obnoxious 'Tammy' role – even before the movie 'Tammy' came out, I've completely disliked her repetitive nonsense of a nasty woman. Now, I must always put the disclaimer when she's brought up: ""Oh, I do love the non-Tammy McCarthy."" Mercifully, she completely abandons that tired and repulsive character here and we can see true comedic talent and timing.She was excellent here, stealing every sceneeven from some talented and great actors/action stars she opposites. The movie, itself, was hilarious, but she truly showed perfect timing and ease in a character that was supposed to be anything but.What was truly refreshing was that this was an absolute spoof off of the James Bond series and yet was an action comedy on its own. It begins telling you this is a mockup of 007 and then becomes a standalone. I loved that bravery and originality in a ""spoof.""While not 100% perfect, and a few scenes could've been reduced, it was so incredibly entertaining and downright hilarious, the greatness outweighed the bad by a landslide. Highly recommended and can't wait to buy on Bluray once available. C'monsequel!",Spy
31,cherold,Hilarious movie with some plotting issues,8,7 November 2017,"The often brilliant Melissa McCarthy is on top of her game as the mousy Susan Cooper, a behind-the-scenes CIA agent who finds herself struggling to prove herself in the field.The movie is rather similar to Bob Hope movies like My Favorite Brunette in which he found himself taking on a more exciting life he isn't completely prepared for. Like Hope, McCarthy will be incredibly incompetent when that can get the laughs but other times prove herself as able as more stereotypical heroes. (Although unlike most Hope movies, McCarthy plays someone who stars with some level of competence).The cast is excellent, with Jude Law doing a fine James Bond impression and very funny performances from Miranda Hart as a goofy fellow agent and Peter Serafinowicz as a sleazebag.There is also a bit of a feminist theme here, with the movie mocking masculine jerks (particularly Jason Statham's insane egotist). There is also some surprisingly solid action, most notably a Jackie-Chan- influenced kitchen fight.While the movie is funny and well-acted, the plot leaves something to be desired. It holds together most of the way, but towards the end the writers toss logic out the window and don't even really try to justify what's going on.Some people are complaining that this movie is foul-mouthed. I'm assuming these people live in small towns where Jimmy Stewart runs the local savings and loan and the Beaver is always getting into trouble. I found it all very funny.",Spy

I've never liked Melissa McCarthy and I'd said multiple times ""you couldn't pay me to watch that."" the comedy wasn't always consistent, but I was dying laughing at a bunch of stuff. multiple hilarious characters and completely unexpected jokes.it also had some horrible characters (cia boss) and some of the jokes fell flat. some of the story was expected, altho a lot wasn't. And I was a little confused if it was trying to be realistic or just stupid-funny at times. regardless, I was very entertained by the comedy and some surprisingly good action. it was a very well made movie with the way it was executed, production value, music, etcThe second time i watched this, i saw the extended version which is 11 minutes longer. it seemed to drag and there were some really unfunny parts that i'm guessing were the extended scenes. i wanted to drop it to a 3.0 but i left it at 3.5 (2 viewings)",Spy
33,Robert_duder,I see what they were doing but it tries too hard,7,26 June 2015,"I sort of had mediocre expectations going into this because that is usually the case with a Melissa McCarthy film. Not that I dislike her at all, she's very good at what she does, but she's a one trick pony. ""Hey look I'm fat, laugh at me, look at me run, look at me be a big dirty offensive loud mouth""...again and again and again. Now I can say that all day long but her movies have always been very amusing somehow. The Heat which was most like this as an action comedy was phenomenal. It was hilarious and fun and full of action. Spy is an attempt at spoofing the James Bond genre, something we've already had done this year to near perfection (Kingsman) and the biggest problem with Spy is that it tries soooo hard. Honestly, there are scenes that will make you feel like you're watching a kid trying his best to make a funny joke. You just want to go ""Oh Sweetheart, that's so cute...not funny but you tried!"" Some of the humour feels very forced and obvious, the characters are not exactly thrilling and overall its an average movie that is what you'd expect. Still...all the bad mouthing being said, it was entertaining, a couple of chuckles and actually has a few decent scenes of action that are generally ruined by a bad joke.Melissa McCarthy is the same gal she always is. At first it seems like this particular character has a softer side but her personality changes when she is undercover into that brash loud mouth character she does so well. You either enjoy her or you don't and for the most part I do. She does manage to really play a good down to earth person in ridiculous circumstances. The supporting cast are all decent in their various roles and serve single purposes and to support McCarthy who is the money maker. If you watch the trailers you'll think this is a buddy-spy-spoof starring McCarthy and Jason Statham. The truth of the matter is that Statham is a third string character at best. He has some good moments as they repeatedly spoof his ""action-martial arts"" persona. But he sporadically shows up and is anything but her partner. Rose Byrne might be the highlight of the film as the insatiably stuck up villainess Rayna. Her and McCarthy have good chemistry and her ridiculously cookie-cutter character works for her and is mostly fun. Miranda Hart is sort of fun as McCarthy's good friend and sort-of-would-be partner in the field. She's awkward and geeky and is likable in her role. Jude Law is decent as the suave super-spy Bradley Fine. He gets some good character developments and some inadvertently funny moments.Paul Feig has firmly placed himself into comedy elite now. I certainly don't always agree with it (I still think Bridesmaids is one of the most over-rated raunch coms of the last decade) but you can't deny his box office prowess. He writes and directs Spy and I think he is surrounded by comedians that he's comfortable with (McCarthy in this case) and he knows exactly what her audiences want to see so he gives them that. His comedies don't try too hard to not be anything but just silly gross out comedy and it works for him. In my books he hit a home-run with The Heat which was the perfect blend of action, comedy, characters and raunch and I am convinced he will destroy Ghostbusters but we will wait and see. Spy is an average comedy that you can find some entertainment value in but is definitely not in the tops of any of the main players repertoire. Its just fun. 7/10",Spy
34,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Doesn't work altogether as a movie, but generally does its job as a comedy",7,10 December 2015,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Susan Cooper (Melissa McCarthy) works behind a desk at the command centre of the FBI, but has a solid working relationship with top spy Bradley Fine (Jude Law), until he is killed in the line of duty. Determined to do something of meaning after the death of her friend, Susan volunteers to be part of an undercover operation to thwart a major arms sale, with Agent Ford (Jason Statham), who's not quite as suave and sophisticated as he thinks he is. It puts her on a collision course with Bradley's killer, the ice cold Rose (Rayna Boyanov), but nothing is as clear as it seems.Comedy director Paul Feig's latest offering seemed to have made more of an impact on its DVD release than its cinema one, where it appeared to have slipped by the radar. Like many films these days, there seems to be a pretty even split between the positive and negative reviews, when the truth is it's a real in between offering. Weirdly over ambitious and wanting to go beyond the confines of a simple comedy, for simple laughs it does its job pretty well, but lets itself down by going on far too long, developing an overly elaborated, twisty turny plot and an uneven tone.Cast wise, in the lead role, McCarthy fits in to another comedy persona, beginning as a pretty sweet, unassuming underdog, before transforming into the feisty, foul mouthed act she's known for as the story progresses and the script requires it. Brit Miranda Hart pops up as her work colleague and friend, and isn't surprising at all, just being the same persona from her TV show. She's just there, and you'll either like her or loathe her, as such. Meanwhile, Statham simply doesn't have the demeanour or tone to fit a comedy role, even if he is poking fun at himself, while Boyanov is just a little too cold and ruthless for such a light role. How much Law was paid for such minimal screen time and minimal effort doesn't bear thinking about...This is really just a curious mess of a comedy, part spy spoof, part comedy in its own right, with a dash of something that wants to be a serious addition to the series. For a few simple laughs, though, its fine if you're in the right mood. ***",Spy

I'd also be lying if I said I wasn't pleasantly surprised by 'Spy (2015)', though, because, while it's predictable and predictably clichéd in both its narrative and overall execution, the feature is actually rather entertaining and even sort of endearing in its own, albeit slightly neutered and kind of cringe-inducing, way. It's not particularly funny, though there are some jokes that land amidst the many that don't, and there's a narrative element that takes a certain character and their arc in an annoying direction, one that actually goes so far in that specific direction it almost runs counter to itself, but there's plenty to like here.

37,bowmanblue,Couldn't hold it together,6,4 August 2017,"I know that the 'spy genre' is as old as the hills thanks to the everlasting Bond franchise, so much so that even spy movie parodies have become commonplace. Therefore, my hopes were only relatively high that Melissa McCarthy could pull one off with little more than having a female as the lead spy being the main noticeable difference. She plays a CIA agent who spends her career sitting behind a desk, providing intel for the 'real' spy, played by Jude Law. However, in a turn of events that is there to simply move the plot forwards, she ends up being sent out on a mission. And, for once, the 'hilarious consequences' promised in the trailer actually prove to look true.Once she's unleashed on the world (armed naturally with all the latest 'Q-style' gadgets every spy must have in their handbag) it's pretty funny. I was really enjoying the film, especially her interactions with Jason Statham. Now, whereas McCarthy is well used to comedy, Statham is hardly known for his sense of on-screen humour. However, he stole every scene for me and, even though he's in it a fair bit, he wasn't in it enough for my liking! However, as Statham's involvement was decreased, so did my enjoyment of the film.I've seen a fair few films which I would describe as 'films of two halves.' Normally, they're a bit slow to start, but, once they get going, really do pick up and entertain. Sadly, in my opinion, 'Spy' was the opposite. I was really enjoying McCarthy's trademark foul-mouthed banter and, despite the plot hardly being anything original (i.e. spy parody), I felt the jokes hit almost every time.However, the longer the film went on, the less jokes there seemed to be. Or, if there were jokes, they didn't seem half as funny as the first half's offerings. The film kind of moved away from comedy and went more for straight spy movie. By that I mean the plot took over which was just about as generic as they come. You have the baddie with the nuke and the doublecross and everything you'd see in either a Bond film, or any other spy parody.Overall, it's not bad, it's just one of those films that I feel would have worked better as a stand-alone TV show where the jokes could have remained tighter throughout the whole runtime instead of seemingly running out of steam midway through. Die-hard fans of McCarthy should probably enjoy this more than most and it was fun to see Jason Statham making fun of himself for a change, but apart from that, it's a film that I'd rather watch on TV than actually pay full price for.",Spy
38,ThomasDrufke,Bond Spoof that Works,7,15 November 2015,"I always appreciate the comedies that don't take themselves too seriously, but also don't treat the audience like they're idiots. Spy is a good balance of the physical nonsense humor that Melissa McCarthy is known for, with a mix of smart and witty humor that ultimately bring in the most laughs. It's also one of the few action comedies this year that actually is more impressive on the action end than comedic. This is all a tribute to Paul Feig, who is establishing himself as a comedic staple of this decade.The best parts of Spy all derive from the fun that this cast has at playing these characters. Jason Statham does indeed steal the show like everyone says, but he's even better than advertised. He's notably making fun of himself and his numerous over the top action films over the span of his lengthy career. The biggest laughs come from his monologues that 'explain' all the 'great' things his character has done for the CIA. It's Statham's serious delivery that makes the comedy hit so hard.Feig has stated that he was inspired by the James Bond franchise, which is clearly visible through everything from the opening credits/song, characters, and it's official poster covered in gold (Goldfinger, 1964). The important thing is that it's a good spoof. How McCarthy's character becomes a spy so quick? Not the most believable transformation. And she does tend to fall into her usual McCarthyisms from her other films, but it never takes you out of the film. So in all, the performances are all good and more importantly, fun, and the action is surprisingly well handled. Spy is definitely worth seeing.+Statham poking fun at himself+All the actors seem like they are having fun+Feig's directing+Bondisms-Quick transformation into a spy7.2/10",Spy

40,cricketbat,A joke that goes on too long,5,23 November 2018,"Spy is a funny movie, but it feels like a joke that goes on too long. The humor is almost entirely dependent on the improvised dialogue between actors and Melissa McCarthy playing the same type of character we've come to expect. However, it's fun to watch a different take on the spy genre and this movie also features some impressive action scenes. Plus, Rose Byrne is in it, and that never hurts a movie.",Spy
41,lesleyharris30,"A Fun Parody of the Spy Genre,",7,26 March 2016,"Spy is a good movie with a very well written storyline and a terrific comedic cast. It's a very funny, clever parody of the spy genre, as we see Melissa McCarthy, in one of her funniest performances to date, forced in on a real super spy mission. McCarthy is also joined by a stunning cast that includes Rosa Byrne, Jude Law, Alison Janney, Jason Statham and the hilarious Miranda Hart, director Paul Feig takes big advantage of these actors willingness to improvise and ad lib. I felt that Jude Law was very underused, I loved the way he portrayed this character, I would liked for Bradley to have had a bigger role, his characterisation was brilliant and the long period in which he was absent disappointed me. Some of the humour was immature at times, which is the main reason I dropped it from an eight to a seven, featuring fart jokes, bats in the workplace, characters pining over McCarthy's character, some of the humour was so clever that the jokes like that really brought me down. It may have its flaws, but Spy is good fun and it's talented cast certainly shine, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy. Susan Cooper is tasked with a real mission beyond the grounds of her office space. Best Performance: Jude Law",Spy
42,secondtake,Take off your gloves comedy...anything goes!,8,21 July 2015,"Spy (2015)Hilarious. Drop dead funny start to finish. This is a madcap takeoff off the standard spy movie, complete with portable nuclear bomb, gadgets that do amazing things, hand-to-hand combat, and a motor scooter. Prepare thyself. The movie opens with Jude Law as a slim, Bond-type spy in a hot situation, and then there is the sneeze. But this isn't a Bond spoof. It's not Jude Law but Melissa McCarthy who runs the film. And she has comic timing and that underdog toughness with a firecracker behind every comeback to make this film pop at every turn. If you aren't laughing at her face, or her wisecracks, you'll be laughing at the situation and the plot that never stops giving. It's all nonsense of course. That's the point. This is in the vein of the ""Airplane"" and ""Austin Powers"" kind of comedy where a situation is created that allows for all kinds of absurdity. It's a gold mine. Characters get to say things we all wish we could say. Word play is a big part of it, so keep your ear tuned. And the supporting cast goes with the implausible flow, especially the evil woman (Rose Byrne) and a couple of McCarthy sidekicks (Jason Statham).Who is director Paul Feig? A television director, and an actor (who went to my high school!), who made his true breakthrough recently with a string of three Melissa McCarthy films (including this one). They have hit a stride that you need to see to appreciate. And they both know it.Worth seeing, and worth seeing twice.",Spy
43,CuriosityKilledShawn,Something beginning with M,4,13 March 2019,"Is it man-hating? Is it misandry?Paul Feig is not a director I admire. I was mostly amused watching Bridesmaids (I was the only one laughing in the cinema during the screening) and The Heat bored me to sleep. I skipped Ghostbusters 2016 after his distaste for fans of that series became apparent. But upon watching Spy I have come to the conclusion that this man might actually be disturbed. The rampant man-hating here is both morbid and clinically fascinating.The story is a rehashed version of the superior 1985 Chevy Chase/Dan Aykroyd comedy Spies Like Us with mild aspirations of being a James Bond/Jason Bourne parody. Melissa McCarthy is the underdog desk jockey given a chance at working in the field and she does her best with the messy script. I like McCarthy, she gets a lot of hate even though she's a talented comedic and dramatic actress, but she needs to start distancing herself from Paul Feig.Coherence and pace are thrown out the window in favour of endless, tiresome gags at the expense of men and male dignity. Sorry Feig, we don't owe you our dignity. Men built the world and its not for you to portray each and every one of us as a sexual predator, moron, or an expendable piece of meat. Of the many, many, many dead bodies in this film only two are female and the rest are white men. Feig obviously enjoys killing men but he's not got the moxie to make any of them a shade darker.I'm so sick and tired of these ""comedies"" from the last 15 or so years directed by Feig and his peers (especially Judd Apatow) that last in excess of 2 hours. I find these bloated running times to be arrogant, condescending, self-important, and unfocused. Spy should have been a 95-minute movie. It's more than half an hour longer than that. Feig had way too much power here and an editor not afraid to chop it down could have saved it. I defy you to properly follow the plot and fully understand what is happening and why. There is a very funny (however smug) movie somewhere in here, but it's lost in Feig's man-hating indulgence and his over-confidence of his own screenplay.The ""hilarious"" dialogue follows the same, single flow for the entire duration.Character 1: Effing, effing, eff, eff yourself, eff, eff, eff, (something wacky and weird), mother eff (weirdness), effer, the eff, (quirkiness), eff yourself, effing, eff.
Character 2: Wow, that's not normal.Even if the above problems were not enough, how many times must we have a British TV star pop up in an American movie as an exaggerated stereotype designed to make the Yank look cool? Wonder Woman, The Mummy, every character played by Hugh Grant or Stephen Merchant, C3PO, etc, etc. Enough is enough. Miranda Hart plays the one role she is seemingly capable of playing, wilfully typecasting herself for the disgrace of being in a big budget Hollywood movie.The action is of the stutter-cut and speed-ramping variety. The cinematography is wide and flat with unnaturally boosted colors, and the camera blocking is very televisual. There are sitcoms with more grace and fluidity. I've had it with Feig. Blake Edwards he ain't. I will never watch another one of his movies and I'm hoping that his loud misandry and the bomb of Ghostbusters 2016 has crippled his ability to make such rotten garbage.",Spy

49,tabuno,"An Interesting Uneven, Ragged Comedy Spy Thriller",7,14 January 2019,"7 June 2015. Either Melissa McCarthy or the director/scriptwriter Paul Feig attempted to create a new spy comedy genre using an hefty female character who also happens to be a good stand up comic and using plenty of R-Rated live stand comedy acts along with the drunken beer crowd. The results of this attempt comes down to a pretty subjective preference for this form of comedy which not everyone I assume really gets off on. There have been much more smoother and witty comedic spy movies such as the ironic dual identity comedy True Lies (1994), the comedy duo of Mr. and Mrs. Smith (2007), the traditionally awkward male spy of Gun Shy (2000), the much witty straight guy version Wild Target (2010). Even Sandra Bullock's performance in Miss Congeniality (2000) might be a good comedic comparison to contrast Spy with. In some ways, the script tries too hard to be Peter Sellers funny but in the more crude, sexed up contemporary way.What would have been even more fascinating and a great career move would have been to have Melissa try a serious Bruce Willis performance as in The Whole Nine Yards (2000) with Jude Law playing the bumbling super spy. In some ways, this movie uses James Bond music melodic chords with a parody of large figured woman which only degrades and perpetuates the derogatory image of them instead of bringing a more authentic respect to them. Or if such a comedic performance was insisted about, emulation of Pierce Brosnan's character in The Matador (2005) might have offered a more serious challenge to the comedic spy genre or the female characters in Daisy & Violet (2011) or John Cusack in Grosse Point Blank (1997). The perhaps the best contemporary female comedy spy movie would be Katie Holme's character in Miss Meadows (2014).",Spy
50,The-Sarkologist,Another cool James Bond spoof,8,21 May 2015,"Well, I have finally discovered a Melissa McCarthy movie that I have actually enjoyed. Okay, I generally don't judge a movie based entirely on the actors – well, sometimes I do, and considering Jason Stratham is also in this film, and that it is one of those goofy spy films, made me want to go and see it despite McCarthy having the main role, and I must admit that she was nowhere near as annoying as she was in some of the other films of hers that I have seen.Anyway, somebody has leaked the identity of all of the CIA's top agents to a black marketeer who has a nuclear bomb for sale, and upon learning this they realise that they need to send somebody onto the field who is a relative unknown, which is where Susan Cooper comes into the picture. Basically she has a desk job where she provides intelligence to the agents in the field, and has been assigned to the agent Bradley Fine. However Fine is killed when attempting to infiltrate the hideout of one of his targets, but before he is killed, the CIA are warned not to send their other agents.So, Cooper decides to volunteer, and we already know that she is incredibly good at her job, despite the fact that the ops room at the CIA has bats in the ceiling and rats running around everywhere. In fact it gives us the impression that the CIA is quite underfunded, and its field operatives are all James Bond like characters, or testosterone filled action heroes who have little in the brains department (particularly since one takes a boat to go on a Mediterranean cruise despite the boat being located in a lake).So, we have McCarthy travel to some exotic European cities (you have to have exotic locations in a spy movie, especially one taking the mickey out of the James Bond franchise), including Paris, Rome, and Budapest. We also have Cooper taking on some interesting roles, usually divorced or single woman who are involved in some Amway style business. She is also regularly told to watch and observe, but we seriously can't expect her to follow orders, especially when she ends up saving the life of the main suspect a number of times. Basically it is was of those feel good action films where the quiet unassuming one ends up coming out good.",Spy
51,Reno-Rangan,A redefined wonderful spy movie.,8,24 October 2015,"I know Melissa McCarthy since 'Gilmore Girls', but never thought she would rise this far, especially to dominate in a movie with the presence of the big names around her, that too in an action film equivalent to top quality. She's one of my favourite actresses, even I enjoyed thoroughly her under-appreciated 'Tammy'. So this is where the action stars become comedians and comedians action stars. Indeed, it worked out so well.It shames comedy-spy flicks like 'The Pink Panther', 'Johnny English' etc. From the director of 'The Heat', helmed another perfect female oriented comedy. Jude Law was a decent as usual, but Jason Statham was unbelievably awesome in his tiny part. I had plenty of good laughs, the loud ones after a long time. I still remember the unicorn joke and I can't stop laughing. And roof over a bike, gadgets and so on... I find Melissa McCarthy's line deliverance are so funny and I enjoy her films specially for that reason.I know they used a stunt double and blue/green screens in the crucial segments for a better result. But still she excelled in all stunt sequences that required physically herself in front of the camera. One of the trivia says, after the end of each day shooting, she looked like fell down an elevator shaft. Her hard work definitely paid off very well.There are lots of adult oriented comedy, so strictly it is for grownups only and may be matured teens. I'll be definitely disappointed if they won't make a sequel for this. If they do, I hope they retain all the cast, especially Statham along the lead actress. And finally I'm looking forward the director-actress's the third collaboration, 'Ghostbusters'.7½/10",Spy
52,sol-,Finding one's assertiveness when undercover,7,24 December 2015,"Temporarily reassigned as a field agent, a desk job CIA agent becomes unexpectedly embroiled in a bomb smuggling plot in this energetic James Bond spoof starring Melissa McCarthy and Jason Statham. In a Golden Globe nominated role, McCarthy is surprisingly quite effective, very mild-mannered and never quite self-assured, or at least until she goes undercover and has a chance to assert herself. Her hurt and downtrodden facial expressions are a true reminder of the acting potential she showed in 'St. Vincent' with trademark crudeness pushed aside. Statham impresses even more than McCarthy though in a tailor-made role designed to parody his own tough guy image, always rambling on about ridiculous career achievements and utterly indignant when told that a ""'Face/Off' machine"" does not actually exist! The film tends to often go for easy laughs though with loud, crass humour of the gross-out variety. There is an eye-rolling bit in which McCarthy vomits on a corpse and none of her vocal vulgarities when pretending to be a hardened bodyguard are especially funny. The jokes work at least half the time though and the parts that are funny are very, very funny. The Bond parody stuff is very much on the mark too with excellent 007 stylised opening credits including a memorable theme song and some unexpected Q department gadgetry of sorts. 50 Cent also has a fun cameo and among the film's secondary supporting players, Jude Law shows that he could in fact be the next James Bond while Allison Janney is amusing as the not easily amused CIA director.",Spy

54,eddie_baggins,Statham steals the show,7,22 February 2016,"2016While her shtick is most surely wearing a little thin after such dire films as Identify Thief and Tammy, everyone's favourite plus sized comedian Mellissa McCarthy gets her mojo back via this impressive comedy caper that plays neatly against type and features a scene stealing Jason Statham who just about runs away with the whole show.The less said about Spy's story the better as it really is almost to lame to make mention but director Paul Feig (the man in charge of heralding in the new era of Ghostbusters) seems to know that with his cast delivering, no one will really care that Spy barely has enough story for a short film let alone a near 2 hour feature.Right down to its James Bond like title credits, to the room full of high tech gadgets, Spy makes its intentions known quite early but shunning the now gloomy realism of the modern day bond franchise this film is all about the laughs but it also delivers some neat action and some to be warned, brutal violence that may make the weaker stomached viewers feel all types queasy. Throats will be dissolved, hands will be threaded by kitchen knives and headshots will be made as Spy is not afraid to mix blood with laughs.While McCarthy remains somewhat subdued through the film's opening hour or so once her interplay with Rose Byrne's nasty villainess Rayna takes centre stage the loud mouthed fast talking we've come to expect from her comes to full fruition and the film really goes up a notch. But all of McCarthy's hijinks aside the real star of this show is the aforementioned Jason Statham who has the most fun his had since the last Crank exploded onto the screen and his try hard agent Rick Ford is someone you'll be hoping gets more screen time in the near future. Whether Rick is explaining about his many dangerous exploits ""I'm immune to 179 different types of poison"" or setting off on a doomed boating trip, Statham has a blast here and it's easily one of 2015 most memorable support roles.The stories slight and there are a large portion of jokes that fall flat but when Spy nails it's material it's a hugely enjoyable ride that delivers spy hijinks like we've never seen before. With a nice return to form turn by McCarthy, who now has to work harder to make us like her and with an on fire Jason Statham, Spy is one of 2015's most effective comedies.3 ½ office bats out of 5",Spy

So, some parts of the film were over exaggerating, like the fact that the protagonist was so lethal even though she seemed not to be. I am not saying that she couldn't possible use her gun as she did, but the fighting scenes were clearly impossible. The story is not very original, with Susan being smitten with her partner, going out to revenged him, finds her true self eventually, everyone applauds, even the villains in this case. And some of the jokes weren't that good, not to mention the guy from Eurovision singing his one and only hit for no obvious reason.

56,leonblackwood,Funny throughout! 7/10,7,24 January 2016,"Review: I really enjoyed this movie! I laughed all the way through this, far fetched comedy and the mixture of top class actors, gave it the shock factor. The funny script and impressive action scenes were great and it was good to see the funny side of Jason Statham. Melissa McCarthy plays a desk bound CIA employee (Susan Cooper), who guides her partner, Bradley Fine (Jude Law) through his various missions and secretly has a crush on him. Whilst on a mission to retrieve a nuclear bomb from Tihomir Boyanov, he accidentally kills him without getting the bombs location. The only other person who might know the bombs location is Boyanov's daughter, Rayna (Rose Byrne), so Fine goes to her house to try and gather some information. On his entry, Rayna kills him while Susan is watching and she tells Susan that she knows the identities of all of the agents. Susan then volunteers to become a field agent so she can take-down Rayna and revenge Fine, so her boss Elaine Crocker (Allison Janney) agrees on her terms, as long as she doesn't have any contact with Rayna. One of the other agents, Rick Ford (Jason Statham), is disgusted with Elaine's decision to put Susan in the field and he quits his job and leaves the agency. Susan is then sent to Paris to spy on Sergio De Luca (Bobby Cannavale) and she bumps into Ford, who has turned rogue and has no faith in Susan completing the mission. The next day, Susan sees an assassin exchanging Ford's bag with a bomb so she tells Ford about the exchange and then she takes chase against the assassin, who she kills by pushing him off a balcony. Susan then follows De Luca to Rome and she meets her contact, Aldo (Peter Serafinowicz), whose and Italian agent, working for the same agency. She then follows De Luca to a casino but she's not allowed to get near him, so she goes to the bar, were she see's a man put drugs into Rayna's drink. She decides to tell Rayna about the drugs, which saves her life, so Rayna recruits Susan as her bodyguard. They then fly to Budapest, we're another assassin tries to kill Rayna on the plane but Susan saves her life again and safely lands the plane. Rayna is convinced that Susan is a CIA agent, so Susan tells her that her father hired her to protect her. In Budapest, Nancy Artingstall (Miranda Hart) is sent to keep an eye on Susan and another assassin tries to kill Rayna, so Nancy takes Rayna to safety while Susan chases the assassins, who turn out to be the CIA double agents, working for Rayna. Later that night, they go to a party, were Rayna is due to meet up with De Luca's associate Lia (Nargis Fakhri), so Nancy creates a diversion so Susan can stop the meeting. After chasing down Lia, Susan ends up in a fight with her in the kitchen and her life is saved by Fine, who faked his death so he can become Rayna's lover. Susan is then imprisoned with Aldo in a bunker, were Fine tells her that he really faked his death so he can get to the nuclear bomb. Susan and Aldo manage to break out of the bunker and they go to De Luca's mansion, we're they are selling the bomb for diamonds. Susan poses as a double agent and when the bomb is revealed, De Luca kills the buyer and his men and threatens to kill Rayna but Ford appears, which distracts De Luca, so Susan can save Rayna's life again. De Luca then escapes with the bomb and the diamonds in a helicopter so Susan takes chase and hangs on to the landing gear with Ford hanging on to her. Nancy and Aldo arrive in another helicopter and shoot De Luca but he isn't dead and he hangs onto Susan's necklace, which was given to her by Fine, so she unhook's the necklace and De Luca falls to his death. Elaine then arrives to retrieve the bomb and Rayna is arrested, realising that she has found a friend in Susan. Elaine then appoints Susan as an agent and gives her files for her next mission. The director really did spend his budget well because he was able to get some top class actors, film in different countries and have some impressive action scenes whilst still making the storyline witty and air tight. Jude Law proves that he should be a candidate to play Bond and Jason Statham shows that he can play comedic roles, so like Tom Cruise in Tropic Thunder, I hope he stars in more movies in this genre. Anyway, I really enjoyed this movie the first time round but I doubt that it will have the same affect the second time round. Enjoyable! Round-Up: Melissa McCarthy, 45, has really proved that you don't have to have the perfect body and dashing looks to become an action hero, with this movie. I was impressed with her fighting skills, even though it was, most probably, a body double and her unique comedy style really worked well in this film. Since her big break in 2011 in Bridesmaids, her movies have nearly grossed a Billion dollars, which is quite impressive for a late bloomer. Anyway, this movie was written and directed by Paul Feig, 53, who also brought you Bridesmaids and the Heat, which also starred Melissa McCarthy. She seems to be his lucky charm! I hope they bring out a sequel to this movie, with the same characters because it has a great mixture of agents, who all brought something fresh to this project.Budget: $65million Worldwide Gross: $235.6millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action, crime, comedies starring Melissa McCarthy, Jude Law, Rose Byrne, Jason Statham, Bobby Cannavale, Raad Rawi, Jessica Chaffin and 50 Cent. 7/10",Spy
57,Ed-Shullivan,Writer/Director Paul Feig tried too hard to push Ms. McCarthy's natural comedic talent,5,13 January 2016,"Mrs. Shullivan and I are huge fans of Melissa McCarthy's physical comedy in Mike and Molly, and we just adored her in the earlier 2000-2007 television series the Gilmore Girls. This feature film Spy has a super opening scene tantalizing the audience that we just may be in line for a blockbuster spoof of the James Bond films. The opening musical score was awesome and it looked like the film was off to a great start.Melissa McCarthy plays Susan Cooper, who is the telecommunication officer assigned to assist special agent Bradley Fine played to perfection by the handsome and swashbuckling international FBI agent/spy Jude Law. But as Ms. Cooper likes to point out to her FBI boss Elaine Crocker played by Allison Janney Ms. Cooper is ""technically"" an FBI Field Agent having come first in her graduating class. The plot is simple enough, a war head atom bomb was unfortunately stolen by industrialist millionaire Tihomir Boyanov and when he is accidentally killed by agent Bradley Fine the bombs location is undetermined. Only through the intelligence gathering of the FBI's office telecommunication officer Susan Cooper, does the agency realize that the atom bomb is in the hands of the dead industrialist's daughter Rayna Boyanov, played by the classy, sexy and smart Rose Byrne.As Rayna Boyanov knows the FBI agents who have previously worked in the field, the agency decides to allow Susan Cooper to go to Paris France and find the atom bomb herself. One agent though, agent Rick Ford played by action star Jason Statham follows Susan Cooper to Paris because in his own mind, he is even better than James Bond in the field and he believes the clumsy office technician Susan Cooper is just not up to the task of saving the world on her own.Wow, the films first 30 minutes gave Mrs. Shullivan and I some anticipation of what was to follow. The film was off to a fantastic start with some great comedy, action, and a simple enough plot. The FBI agents needed to find that atom bomb before the USA suffered a catastrophe in the hands of the evil doers now led by the sexy Rayna Boyanov. Unfortunately the rest of the film was one silly action stunt after another and rarely was the camera lens not focused on Melissa McCarthy. As stated earlier, Mrs. Shullivan and I are huge fans of Ms. McCarthy's comedic talents, and she is a truly wholesome and beautiful woman to look at with a never ending array of facial expressions that just make an audience laugh uncontrollably.I believe writer/director Paul Feig over utilized his star actress Melissa McCarthy in every single scene and the films intent on a James Bond spoof comedy would have been more enjoyable with a bit more balance of the supporting cast carrying some of the comedy as well. The cast was top notch, and Ms. McCarthy I cannot say enough about her, she is a terrific comedic actress. My only complaint was that Mrs. Shullivan and I found the movie started to drag on with agent Susan Cooper continually saving the day as she fumbled her way through one action scene after the next. We watched the directors version of the film, and not the theatrical release version. If you are not fond of hearing a barrage of cuss words and specifically, that little four letter word that starts with the letter ""F"" and rhymes with the word ""luck"" then you may want to stick to the theatrical version. We found the cuss words were also over extended as was Ms. McCarthy's star power.Overall, it is worth a watch for the great 30 minute start to this James Bond spoof, and if you feel a desire to fall asleep don't say I did not warn you. Mrs. Shullivan and I would ask that Ms. McCarthy try and retain more control over the final cut of her future films. If I use an analogy related to food, any good restaurant cannot survive on just one great dinner, because consumers will get tired of the same taste in their mouth very quickly, even if that one meal is a great one.I give the ""SPY"" a 5 out of 10 rating. Sorry Melissa, we hope your next film will be more balanced than this performance was.",Spy

59,matthewssilverhammer,"Crazy Funny...Nothing More, Nothing Less",8,12 June 2015,"Spy is everything this year's Hot Pursuit wished it was: a giant, female-centric, laugh-out-loud action comedy that's sprawling in its set-pieces, yet shining in its silliness. Through its physical comedy and unexpectedly cool combat scenes, it still manages to feel like a screwball comedy throwback with stellar verbal sparring between the great actors. So it's not groundbreaking like Mad Max: Fury Road, or mind-boggling like Ex Machina, but those aren't the goals. Spy will simply make you happy, nothing more, nothing less; and sometimes that's really enough. Much of that pure joy comes directly from the cast. From top to bottom, these gals and guys propel Spy to higher levels than movies of its kind often get. Everyone just seems to be having an absolute blast and that fun is contagious. Janney and Byrne stand out as solid and strong comedic presences. Hart and Statham steal every scene they are in, each playing with their own Hollywood identities to great effect. At the center of it all, McCarthy and Feig steer the ship swimmingly, often managing heartbreaking honesty and side-splitting hilarity all at once. This mixture can, at times, make the proceedings feel more ""cute"" than LOL funny, especially as the movie's somewhat-long runtime feels its length. However, as you settle into the world, you can't help but love the ways in which it takes the self-righteousness out of spy thrillers by highlighting the hilariously mundane minutiae. Will it change your world or even really challenge you intellectually? Not in the least, but it will undoubtedly make you laugha lot.",Spy
60,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Feig and McCarthy keep 'Spy' from getting too silly/stupid, and even make it occasionally smart",7,6 February 2016,"Director Paul Feig and actress Melissa McCarthy continue to make magic together. ""Spy,"" their third collaboration, is definitely more enjoyable than ""The Heat"" and in many ways measures up to ""Bridesmaids.""McCarthy owns this film. Feig actually wrote it too, unlike the previous two films, but it's clear he did so knowing McCarthy would take it over. She's dynamic, sassy, lovable and foul, and it's delightful to watch even if it's messy.Title alone tells you that ""Spy"" is meant to be a riff on classic spy films, specifically the ""James Bond"" series, but it's not a parody. Rather, Feig plays with spy conventions (especially as they relate to women) and even pokes at what other directors, writers and producers might do if given the same premise of a CIA desk jockey launched into the field to stop a scheme involving a nuclear warhead.In fact, the deception goes beyond the appearances and into the plot. Somehow, Feig keeps the story fresh and intriguing, even when the film descends into goofy, preposterous chaos. It's impressive how good of a tightrope act it manages between stupidity and sharp, effective humor.McCarthy toes that line too. At times she's just a vehicle for improvised shenanigans, and at others there's something genuine in her character, Susan Cooper. It's hard to pin down the character's qualities when she's constantly changing appearances and even personalities, but never for a moment does it seem like she's trying to hard and failing.We do get to watch Jason Statham try the same thing, however, and make a total ass of himself. The star of actual spy movies does have some funny dialogue at times, but his character is a screw-up who talks a mean game. This idiocy is part of the convention-twisting in ""Spy,"" but there are times he just seems like an idiot. It's more fun to watch Peter Serafinowicz as the outrageously lewd Aldo — an Italian agent who Susan encounters in the field at various points in the film — than watch Statham flounder. Jude Law even does a nice job, though his character isn't called upon for much.Rose Byrne as Rayna Boyanov, the film's antagonist — a role she seems to excel in when acting for Feig —continues to nail her comic bits with such incredible poise. She's both a bona-fide villain and a funny caricature of one. Rayna isn't hollow, which would render Byrne unfunny; she's multi-dimensional enough to really work off of McCarthy's Susan. ""Spy"" feels like a multi-bout boxing match between a stupid genre spoof comedy and a professionally improvised, fresh twist on a stupid genre spoof comedy. Every time you prepare to role your eyes and deem it a joke of a film, it comes up with something hysterically clever to pull you back in. Not many films or filmmakers can do it, and that's what makes the Feig-McCarthy duo one to keep an eye on for the long term.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more",Spy

Everyone was funnier because she was in it. She had great bits of comedy with everyone in the movie.Very impressed with Jason Statham's attempt at comedy. It's hard to tell weather he was trying to hard to be funny or purposely hamming it up to make his character over the top, but I'll lean towards the latter cause the results had me dying with laughter as we parodies his own tough guy action hero persona, to the level of cartoon buffoonery. Statham and McCarty together were like a classic sitcom as Statham plays another CIA agent who thinks he's so much better than McCarty's Susan cooper that he can't see his own faults. The action was pretty outrageous. the fight scenes and car chases were just big enough to complement all the comedy, which was the movies main focus, keeping us laughing.Worth seeing, it's non-stop laughter.",Spy

Of course, not all scenes are smooth and meaningful and many McCarthy's character's ""achievements"" are evidently accomplished by stunts, but still: Spy is a good entertainment, with dozens of distinctive performances, and a good example that a well-nourished person can successfully manage in the leading role as well (btw, also in 2015, Forbes named McCarthy the third highest-paid actress in the world).",Spy

Jason Statham is good here, kind of making fun of himself as a action film star. Jude Law and Rose Byrne are also great in there supporting roles.

It even opens with a James Bond type musical number and action scenes. It is directed by Paul Feig, who also handled The Heat and Bridesmaids, both with Melissa. Melissa plays a C.I.A. analyst that works with Jude, a suave James Bond styled secret agent that usually gets the job done. Melissa has gone through the training required for an agent but has never done any actual field work. When Jude actually fails on a job involving Rose, the villain in control of a nuclear bomb, Melissa volunteers to go into the field and finish Jude's mission-it seems that Rose knows all the identities of the regular C.I.A. agents, including Jason. Allison plays the boss at C.I.A. headquarters and gives Melissa her chance to show what she can do. The action scenes are very good, with one in particular being a confrontation in a kitchen involving Melissa, a knife, a frying pan and an evil villainous henchwoman that really looked good. Jason has several good fight scenes, too, but he is also very funny. It seems that he likes to exaggerate his exploits just a tad and some of his stories are really stretching believability a bit-he is sort of a cross between Rambo and Inspector Clouseau. FYI: Melissa's real life husband, Ben Falcone, makes his usual cameo; He is the tourist that asks Melissa for directions to a Burger King. As the credits start, there is a scene and during the credits are clips of more missions, with another scene at the very end, after the end credits.

65,meeza,"Not a bad Spy, but not brilliant!",7,15 August 2016,"Writer-Director Paul Feig's comedy ""Spy"" is a homage to Secret Agent films starring a bumbling female spy named Susan Cooper played by Melissa McCarthy. I liked this movie better when it was called ""Austin Powers I mean Susan Cooper: International Woman of Mystery"". OK, I am just kidding. ""Spy"" did not turn out to be a bad filmmaking mission, but I did not think it had enough creative mojo for top ratings, as it received from many critics. Again, McCarthy stars as Susan Cooper, a desk bound CIA analyst who volunteers to go undercover to prevent global disaster. Yes, we have heard this premise before, but Feig keeps it moderately entertaining. And it does help that McCarthy does a commendable job in her starring performance as Cooper. Rose Byrne brings some fire into the picture also as the fem villain Rayna Boyanov. Byrne and McCarthy again bring some solid chemistry in scenes together. Jason Statham was hilarious as the foul-mouthed Spy Rick Ford; even though Feig criminally underused him.

66,alindsay-al,A great comedy that really had me laughing,8,9 July 2015,"It seems this is the year of spy films but this one plays it a bit differently as spy is a straight up comedy and I gotta say it does its job really well and is a great film. The premise of this film sees a nuclear bomb saleswoman get all the names of the cia agents, so to track her down they send in a complete unknown agent. I have never been a huge fan of Melissa McCarthy but in this film she totally works, she is really funny in this film in different types of ways. You like her character and believe in her character as she goes on her journey and adapts to the different situations. The supporting cast is also just fantastic, rose Byrne plays the villain and just like she was in bad neighbours she is hilarious and plays the villain up perfectly for this film. Jude law is great as a sort of James bond ripoff and plays it up really well throughout the film. The real show stealer in this film though is Jason Statham Who plays a complete parody of him in every action movie he is in. He monologues about how tough he is and it is utterly hilarious and watching him in action was the best part of the film, with his chemistry with McCarthy being great to watch. The journey that the characters go on is really cool and as I mentioned before it is great seeing Melissa mccarthys character adapt and change as the movie went on and I liked that. However, if you have seen any spy films before you have seen all the twists and turns before and it doesn't hit the emotional impact that it wants to hit. The script is really really funny with all the dialogue that is intended for humour really hitting its mark and should make you laugh allot. However, the film tries to hit a bit of a dramatic level and it just is basic and easily is the weakest part of the movie. The style of the film is great, I couldn't believe how good the action scenes were and how cool they made these characters. Overall spy is a little bit below kingsman but it is still great and definitely worth the watch.",Spy
67,estebangonzalez10,"McCarthy, Statham, and Byrne are hilarious together",7,5 June 2015,"""Can you imagine me as a spy?""It's a safe bet to say that Melissa McCarthy is at her comedic best when working alongside writer and director, Paul Feig (Bridesmaids and The Heat), so if you were worried about her recent failings in Identity Theft and Tammy, fear not because Spy delivers plenty of laughs and interesting action sequences. McCarthy can easily be discarded for repeating the same gags, but she proves that when given an intelligent script she can continue to deliver strong comedic roles. It helps that Feig is a fan of the spy genre and he cleverly manages to balance the action set pieces with the comedic moments. Spoof films have grown tiresome over the past years, but when done correctly they can still be entertaining and Spy is such a film. The film didn't open strong with me, but it eventually grew on me as McCarthy's character was empowered. In Spy, McCarthy plays the under confident Susan Cooper, a CIA analyst who serves as the eyes and ears of one of the agency's top field agents, Bradley Fine (Jude Law). It becomes evident from the opening sequence that Fine is a spoof of James Bond, but I felt those moments a bit forced. When a mission goes wrong and the identities of all of the spies in the agency have been compromised, Elaine Crocker (Allison Janny), the agency's stern boss decides to send Susan to Europe to uncover a conspiracy involving an arms dealer who is trying to sell a nuclear bomb to terrorists. The elegant dealer, Rayna Boyanov, is hilariously played by Rose Byrne who is convincing as one of the main villains in the film. Susan's mission in Europe is compromised however, when the aggressive agent Rick Ford (Jason Statham) dismisses orders to stay clear from the site and decides to infiltrate the location despite having his cover blown. The interplay between Susan and Rick and between Susan and Rayna are by far the highlight of the film as these actors play off each other extremely well. Despite some hilarious scenes involving Statham, McCarthy, and Byrne, Spy misses some marks with a couple of characters. Jude Law is an incredibly talented actor, but I wasn't a fan of his role here. He might be spoofing James Bond, but it's Statham who delivers the most laughs poking fun of the macho character he has played during most of his career. It was great to see him back in a comedic role after his initial collaborations with Guy Rithcie (Snatch and Lock, Stock, and two Smoking Barrels). The cameo with 50 Cents was also quite horrendous and forced. Miranda Hart also has an important supporting role as one of Susan's best friends in the agency, but I wasn't a particular fan of her character and most of her jokes fell flat. Despite missing the mark at times, Spy is still hilarious when it centers on McCarthy, Statham, and Byrne. The feminist message might be too loud and obvious, but it works extremely well for a genre film where females are often overlooked and reduced to desk jobs. Spy also succeeds at delivering genuine suspense as we follow the hero trying to solve the case. There are memorable action sequences that take place in a kitchen and on a private jet that are incredibly entertaining, and it's not something you see in spoof films. Spy balances the comedy very well and it delivers the action that espionage films have us accustomed to. I had a lot of fun with it. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Spy

70,jimbo-53-186511,Plenty of energy but not enough laughs,4,8 November 2016,"Susan Cooper (Melissa McCarthy) is a desk-bound CIA analyst with 10 years of service who has been integral in assisting CIA field-agent Bradley Fine (Jude Law) in completing his missions by being the 'voice in his ear.' When Fine fails to complete the mission and with all other field-agents already being compromised Cooper volunteers to go out into the field to track down Rayna Boyanov (Rose Byrne) and prevent her from selling a nuclear weapon to a group of terrorists.Given the fact that this is intended as a spoof of spy films I presumed that the fore-running theme would be to send an agent out into the field who is clumsy and incompetent and yet they believe in their own mind that they are brilliant - this worked well in Johnny English and Get Smart. The problem here is that Susan Cooper is neither incompetent in her desk-bound job and nor is she incompetent in the field. This approach doesn't serve the film well and at times it feels too much like you're watching a regular spy film than a so called spoof of a spy film.Another issue I had with this film was the decision for Cooper to not have a partner for large portions of the film. I always feel that spy spoofs thrive better when there are two very different people thrown together to complete a mission - this creates a dynamic and camaraderie and having two conflicting personalities at each other throat's will more often than not make a film of this nature much funnier. Statham plays rogue agent Rick Ford who is effectively the thorn in Cooper's side, but he isn't permanently partnered with her and I found that he seemed to drift in and out of the story willy-nilly. This is a shame as writer and director Paul Feig set both characters up perfectly, but for some reason chose to keep them separate for the majority of the film. The reason I say it's a pity is that I thought Statham's character was funny - his BS stories become increasingly ridiculous and exaggerated and I found it very hard not to laugh at his rather tall stories. The only slight problem I had with his character is that he's only shown as being incompetent now and again rather than being totally incompetent meaning there was no real consistency with his character.As I've mentioned the biggest mistake that was made here was the decision not to have Cooper and Ford working as partners which is what ultimately weakened the film. Feig does partner Cooper up with Artingstall (Miranda Hart)later in the film, but Hart doesn't have the amusing material that Statham had to work with which meant that Hart & McCarthy's scenes were nowhere near as funny as Statham and McCarthy's.The plot is fairly generic which wouldn't be a problem if the film was actually funny, but most of the funny moments were between Statham and McCarthy, but again they weren't on screen together often enough which is why the picture was short on laughs. In fact the first laugh I got from this film was when Statham first showed up on screen which just goes to show that he should have been used more.The performances were all very good; Jude Law seemed to have fun being a James Bond type character. Melissa McCarthy's energy and enthusiasm is infectious and probably makes the film more tolerable than it should be. After seeing Rose Byrne play many nice and likable characters I was unsure how good she would be playing the 'super bitch' but she's excellent and she looks pretty good in this film too. After years of playing serious tough guy type roles, it was good to see Statham sending himself up and he looked like he was having fun here.The film works quite well when Statham and McCarthy are sharing the screen together and I could see that they shared a quirky and rather interesting dynamic. However, Feig's decision to not have them working together throughout the film was a big mistake. The result of this miscalculated risk is a generally humourless film that is saved from the doldrums mainly thanks to great performances from the main players and Jason Statham who managed to generate a laugh from me in nearly every scene that he featured in.",Spy

72,3xHCCH,Melissa McCarthy Marvels!,8,21 May 2015,"Since she started working for the CIA, homely and obese Agent Susan Cooper has been content to be the unseen and unheralded desk support partner of superspy Bradley Fine. In one operation gone wrong, Raina Boyanov, a ruthless international nuclear arms dealer, takes down Fine and threatens all the known CIA field agents. Knowing her anonymity is the CIA's best option, Cooper volunteers to track Boyanov down. From there, Cooper awkwardly and fumblingly goes around Europe disguised as frumpy matrons in order to stop Boyanov and her evil plots.Melissa McCarthy totally owned this film as her own. In her previous films, her characters were very brash,loud and quite unlikeable. But here in ""Spy"", you immediately take a liking to her delightful Susan Cooper and you will be rooting for her for the whole film. Make no mistake, the familiar foul-mouthed McCarthy persona does make an appearance. But here, it is in line with her undercover spy duties.Even if the marvellous physical comedy skills of Melissa McCarthy is front and center on display here, you also cannot ignore the comedic talent displayed by the other actors in the cast, many of whom are more known for dramatic roles. Rose Byrne was so on point as the mega-snooty Raina Boyanov, so funny in her straight-faced over-the-top alpha-bitchy mode. The rich comedic rapport McCarthy and Byrne had with each other as mortal nemeses certainly buoyed the middle act. It was so surprising that this glamorous actress is not averse to physical comedy, as evidenced by Byrne's comically painful scene as her character was pinned down under two heavy-set men while her private plane was having anti-gravity issues. My unexpected favorite in the cast is Jason Statham and his uncharacteristic portrayal of abrasive CIA Agent Rick Ford. We usually see him as the strong and silent macho hero taking up the cudgels of the oppressed in his many action films. He is still strong and macho, but whoa, Statham is definitely NOT silent here! This must be the first time I have heard him deliver lines in mile-a-minute speed as he proudly relates his many incredible career exploits. Never thought Statham could ever be funny. I really enjoyed his scenes.Jude Law was right in his element as Bradley Fine, a suave, tuxedo-clad secret agent and charming ladykiller. Allison Janney plays Cooper's no- nonsense boss Elaine Crocker. Gangsterish Bobby Cannavale plays the glamorous terrorist De Luca. Tall and mousy-looking Miranda Hart plays Nancy, Susan's supportive friend and co-worker in their rat-infested CIA basement. Roguish-looking Peter Serafinowicz plays Aldo, Susan's overly amorous Italian backup agent. All of them stood out in their respective portrayals, helping McCarthy generate more laughs in their scenes together.This is the third time writer-director Paul Feig is working with his favorite actress Melissa McCarthy. In ""Bridesmaids"", McCarthy was funny as part of an ensemble of comediennes. In ""The Heat"", she was funnier, sharing the screen with Sandra Bullock. In ""Spy"", McCarthy is the funniest she has ever been. 8/10.",Spy
73,aharmas,Tons of Action and Plenty of Comedy,9,7 June 2015,"Finally a movie that entertains with both action and comedy has arrived, giving us a parody of the great spy films in recent years, starting with a credit tribute to James Bond and moving on to several set pieces that lovingly and hilariously recreate the famous thrillers of the past. A CIA worker who has supported a spy for many of his missions suddenly sees herself on the other side, as she volunteers to help recover a nuclear weapon from the wrongs hands. For years she has shown plenty of smarts in front of the computer screen, now she must go in the field and demonstrate she is an asset there, too.Susan (McCarthy) resents the fact her superior and colleagues don't see anyone else but a desk person. She also cringes when she is given identities which remind others of what a loser she is supposed to be. Eventually, she is able to prove herself handy with deadly weapons and quite resourceful in other areas. As the mission unfolds, she sees herself surrounded by double spies, assassins, her life put in danger by some of the people she is supposed to be working with in a hilarious race through the streets of Rome, and it's a marvel to see how even some the of the sexy moves made by either her or her Italian counterpart are well, quite believable. There's plenty of colorful language, and this might put off some members of the audience, but it's a rough world, and in truth, the expressions are not as crude as some of the ramblings we have heard in other stupid movies which pass as comedy nowadays. Some of the expressions come in during moments of frustration or disgust as some of the actions by the enemy, and they don't impede the enjoyment of the film.McCarthy has plenty of chemistry with most of the cast, as she confronts Byrne spoiled daughter, Cannavale's smooth villain, interacts with Stratham goofy rebel and Law's suave spy. She's sharp in the delivery of her lines, and her timing is always perfect and on the spot as she must deal with the obstacles both her enemies and colleagues put in front of her.It is really amazing how the balance is kept between the thrills and the laughs. She is dealing both with danger and awkward moments. She must field attacks with knives and bullets as adroitly as she has to defend her choices in attire. The screenplay cleverly addresses how the CIA believes she must be prepared, and it's a riot to see what type of package she is given to survive.I loved how the film takes us through different locales, much like James Bond or the Mission Impossible series does. This film improves on both as we don't have to deal with moody and taciturn heroes or villains. There's no wasted time here. It's a kill or be killed world, and there's no time for more than just a couple of quick returns by way of clever remarks.Go out and enjoy these actors who have created new personas which will forever influence how we will view the next generation of spy films, much like ""Mad Max Fury Road"" has set new standards for apocalyptic entries.",Spy
74,aidanratesmovies,"Some laughs, but mostly dissapointing",6,9 June 2020,"What could have been an outrageous and fun female-led comedy, feels the like sad overused tropes that the film tries to make fun of. Director Paul Feig seems to have some consistency in directing films with somewhat forced comedy, as I also felt with his other hit film Bridesmaids. That isn't to say all his films are bad however, as I did enjoy The Heat and even didn't mind the Ghostbusters remake he was a part of, but there is just something off about Spy and Bridesmaids that just feels like such a missed and misunderstood opportunity. The film is layered with jokes, and can earn itself a few chuckles throughout, mainly towards its center, but sadly it isn't enough to carry the film as its own. The humor seems incredibly forced at times, which can make the film honestly a bit painful to watch, which is so sad considering so much talent is involved with the film. All the actors do try their best to bring their often over-the-top and eccentric characters to life, but some succeed more than others. The standouts in the film would not be any of the main cast members to me, but more the supporting actors, with Jude Law stealing every scene he has on screen, as well as Miranda Hart and Peter Serafinowicz in their wacky roles. The film is moderately entertaining, but seems to get a bit tedious with twist after twist and fight scene after fight scene towards its conclusion. The film seems to try too hard to try to make its audience laugh, and to try to provide the audience with something more different than other spy films, that it takes a cliche of its own on in sports, by providing the viewer with an utterly complicated spy thriller while also trying to balance out the large humor aspect going for it- with minimal success. The film can be beautifully shot at times, with some cool cinematography for both action scenes and just scenes in general. In the end however, Spy hardly seems to prove to be a worthwhile comedy. It meets the minimum standard for comedy goers, but never proves itself to be anything but ordinary, despite trying to break out of the desperate mold it has trapped itself in.

This film incorporates the idea of the spy having a team to back him or her up. I already know what you're going to say, the Mission Impossible movies do that all the time, but if you think about it they really don't. The agent has help for like 5 second but does something on his own for a good long time with impossible odds. Anyway, Jason Statham makes this movie. His lines are hilarious. I hope they make a *good* sequel to this sometime soon.",Spy
77,jadepietro,Live and Let Laugh,7,2 July 2015,"(Rating: ☆☆☆ out of 4)This film is recommended.In brief: Thanks to Melissa McCarthy and a talented cast, this spy spoof is not left out in the cold.GRADE: B Everyone needs a good laugh once in a while and the new comedy, Spy, does deliver a good many laughs, thanks to Melissa McCarthy and a cast that is willing to send up their own screen personalities. Well directed and cleverly written by Paul Feig, the film immediately sets the right mood with its James Bond styled movie credits even before it establishes our low self- esteemed heroine, one misfit named Susan Cooper. Spy shrewdly uses any moviegoer's film knowledge of these super agent espionage thrillers to maximum effect from its opening shoot-out to its world globe-trotting to exotic destinations of intrigue. Although it tends to overdo the action scenes and contrived plot to sacrifice some of its humor, the basic premise works so well.A loyal but ""invisible"" Cooper (Ms. McCarthy) ends up ditching her desk job as Agent Bradley Fine's Miss Moneypenny and goes on assignment to trail a diabolical mastermind, Rayna Boyanov (Rose Bryne), before she can sell a nuclear bomb to the highest bidder. Cooper takes on many disguises, none of which are too flattering, but her guile and quick responses with her on-the-job training keep her busy, even if she is constantly interrupted by an arrogant and bumbling sidekick, Rick Ford (Jason Statham).Credit Mr. Feig with a ingenious gimmick. It is delightful seeing the suave Jude Law (as Fine) playing against character and double pleasure also seeing Statham hamming up the extremes of her deluded character. He assembled a solid ensemble who bring their comedic talents to the film: Miranda Hart as Susan's girl-pal, Peter Serafinnowicz as a slick oversexed Lothario, an uncredited Allison Janney as her no-nonsense boss, and Bobby Cannavale as the crazed criminal. Other actors seem underused and their characters should have been given more screen time: Morena Baccarin, Zach Wood, Michael McDonald, and Björn Gustafsson, much potential wasted.Blame Mr. Feig for less than deft handling of the spy action. If the director/ writer would have concentrated more on the comedy and less on the espionage angle, the film would have been a classic comedy to be long remembered. The film seems to take a sadistic glee in its use of close-ups including shootings, stabbings and slow-motion blood splatter. Its many glorified chases and its non-stop gratuitous violence disrupts humor as the body count rises. For this reason, Spy settles for being is a diverting comedy trifle that can readily be enjoyed and somewhat forgotten.One conspicuous misstep is that aforementioned extreme violence which undercuts the comedy too often, sending the audience one step closer to reality and two paces further back from the farce. But Feig knows how to set up the jokes although sometimes the gags are lame (like the 50 Cent's cameo) or missed opportunities (like the little-used spy gadgetry). Add to that fact that logic defies any reality in this movie, particularly Cooper's physical agility. But logic escapes the escapades in this genre of spy films anyway. So, just sit back and revel in its silliness.But it is the chemistry between the immeasurably likable Ms. McCarthy and a trio of actors (Law, Bryne, and Statham) who improve on the already funny screenplay. McCarthy has played this type of wise-cracking schmo many times and she excels in her comic timing and slapstick. Especially strong is the banter between the over-styled bouffant baddie, a wry Ms. Bryne, and the determined-to-succeed Susan Cooper.All in all, Spy achieves its impossible mission: to make one laugh and be thoroughly entertained.

78,Seraphion,Very Melissa McCarthy,6,10 June 2015,"The movie's story isn't one to be thought about deeply. It's a comedy forced out to be set in the spy sub genre. At most points we're forced to choose from enjoying the comedy or be thrown off seeing that the spy genre story doesn't add up. Yes the story feels stupid, even very stupid. To see how Rayna take Susan's explanation of being her father's bodyguard just to shed it all off when Fine re-emerges. The usual spy movie clichés really don't help the movie since they make the movie very predictable. The acting overall is just another standard performance. I enjoy Melissa McCarthy's comedies just as Rayna catch her red handed as a CIA operative. Rose Byrne and Jude Law provided enough for their characters just to keep the spy side going on. Jason Statham did well enough to keep up with the jokes.",Spy
79,Rob_Taylor,Nothing to see here... move along. Move along very quickly!,5,11 September 2015,"So, I felt in need of a bit of comedic relief today to cheer me up. Sadly, I chose to give Spy a chance and boy, did that ever prove to be a mistake.The first ten minutes are what I can only describe as excruciatingly painful to sit through. The ""humour"" at this point is cringe-inducing to watch and falls flat almost completely. I almost gave up on it at this point, since this is without a doubt the worst start to a comedy movie I've seen for decades. But, I stuck with it, if only to see if things improved once Jason Statham turned up.It did. In fact, at the point he appears, he literally is the funniest person in the room. After that, the humour improves. It still fails more often than not, and relies on innumerable variations of fat person jokes, toilet humour and even the hysterical laughter (sarcasm) to be found in looking extensively at dick pictures found on a mobile phone (I'm not even making that up, honest).For the next hour, it continues in this vein with the comedy essentially amounting to ""Ha-ha! Melissa McCarthy is fat and incompetent. Isn't that a laugh?"" In fact, things only improve when the action starts in earnest around the halfway mark. Whilst the jokes and quips are, frankly, terrible and straight out of a seven year old's repertoire, the chases, pratfalls and comedic violence work much better. In fact, it is only the second half of the film that (barely) saves it from being a complete and godawful mess. But to get there, as I have said, takes the patience of a saint and a lot of teeth-gritting.It also says something that, in a comedy movie, the funniest person on screen is an action star,in the form of Statham. He isn't given much to work with, but he has a sense of timing and presentation that is entirely in lacking in a supposed comedienne, namely Miranda Hart. Her delivery is so wooden and flat she might as well be a piece of Ikea furniture.Jude Law also looks a little out of his element. It's as if he took the part believing it to be an actual serious spy movie and by the time he realised it was a comedy, he felt too embarrassed to quit and just ""soldiered on"".Rapper 50c makes a cameo for no real reason whatsoever and does nothing to improve the movie.Spy isn't the kind of movie you will watch more than once. There're no nuances here that a second watch will reveal and, honestly, sitting through it a second time would be an unendurable torture.Given that Paul Feig wrote and directed this I'm going to suggest to him that he sticks to directing. His similar movie ""The Heat"" was much better for the lack of his writing. This gives me grave concerns for the Ghostbusters reboot that he is also writing and directing. One can only hope that focuses more on physical comedy, else it will not be good.SUMMARY: Gets better as it goes along, but is an exercise in endurance to get there. Childish humour, for the most part, but the physical comedy is decent. Other than that, it just isn't very good.",Spy
80,brando647,BRIDESMAIDS Director Brings His Comedy Chops to Skewer Secret Agents,8,26 March 2016,"It was a big year for spy movies in 2015, kicking off with the fantastic KINGSMAN in February, and then hitting us again at the start of summer with the surprisingly hilarious and simply-titled SPY from director Paul Feig. SPY is basically a big budget spoof of franchises like James Bond, Jason Bourne, and Mission: Impossible; it pulls the inspiration for its gags from the well- trodden tropes of the genre. Feig was responsible for one of my favorite comedies of 2011 (BRIDESMAIDS) and brings along frequent collaborator Melissa McCarthy as the unlikely hero in the film. McCarthy is Susan Cooper, a CIA missionoverseer? I don't recall if they actually give her job title but it essentially boils down to her sitting at a computer in some big CIA control room, giving intel, instructions, and assistance to her assigned agent in the field. Her agent happens to be the debonair (though not as much as he might believe) Bradley Fine, played by Jude Law. When Fine is killed on a mission to retrieve the location of a stolen nuclear weapon from the daughter of an international arms dealer, Cooper volunteers to go into the field to complete the mission. Seeing as how she's spent her entire career behind a computer, there's no chance of being recognized as an agent by the enemy. Now she'll have to face assassins, international criminals, and the incessant advances of a libidinous Italian agent if she wants to get prevent an explosive terrorist attack and avenge the death of her unrequited love.I was surprised at how funny I found SPY. I'm sure it stems primarily from my love for the 007 franchise and the fact that a great many jokes in the film are pokes at that series. Bradley Fine is very much a 007-ish character, suave and deadly even if his intelligence comes into question within moments of meeting him when he refers to a fine wine as ""baccarat"". Jude Law gets to stretch his comedic chops as the ditzy, cool guy of the film but there's enough there to see that he might've actually made a pretty effective James Bond if given the chance. Aside from Law's character, the film gets more mileage from the Bond films and one of its biggest rises from me during the ""Q"" sequence when Cooper is provided her laughably lame spy equipment from the CIA's quartermaster (""MadTV"" alum Michael McDonald in a great cameo). No laser watches or Aston Martins for Cooper; nopeshe's got to have gear that suits her cover. Her horribly depressing cover. Once the film gets going and Cooper is dispatched to Europe on her mission, the 007 jokes peter out and it turns into a rather effective spy film that just so happens to be played for laughs. Take out the humor and SPY could almost work as a (perhaps somewhat generic) secret agent movie. I can appreciate how the jokes are built around the story, instead of vice versa. SPY never goes off on a tangent to deliver some forced punchline. Instead, Feig and his cast find the most hilarious ways to make the events and people in the story itself absurd.Oddly enough, McCarthy is the straightwoman to the film, reacting to the zaniness going on around her. She has a few moments where her usual boisterous self comes through but she mainly generally plays it pretty normal here, giving others the job of being strange to the point of cartoonishness. And I dig it. The best running joke in the film comes in the form of Jason Statham as Rick Ford, a CIA agent who goes rogue when Cooper is assigned to the mission instead of himself. Feig lets Statham play off his tough-guy persona, using his action movie heritage to deliver the joke when Ford goes off on a rant about the insane conditions he's encountered and come out on top before immediately stumbling over his own two feet. Melissa McCarthy is the star of SPY but, because she plays it so low-key, her performance (as good as it is) is drowned out by the ludicrous characters surrounding her. Still, she's the hero and does a great job in the starring role. I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel to SPY in the future with Cooper, now an established agent, taking on another mission. I'm afraid to say too much about SPY because I wouldn't want to ruin any of the best bits but, rest assured, if you're a fan of the spy genre or the work of Paul Feig, SPY is a pretty safe bet for a fun time.",Spy
81,bkrauser-81-311064,A Missed Opportunity,3,20 August 2015,"""Fun feminist spy comedy;"" ""...perfectly enjoyable;"" ""A rib-tickling espionage spoof;"" critics and audiences of America, you have been duped! Spy is not very good, it's barely even passable both as a broad comedy and as a spy-spoof. I'm sorry but this stuff is the lowest of low hanging fruit and even the most seemingly learned among you are poised to be hosed here. Its not completely your fault though critics; I get it. Melissa McCarthy is a talented star. The mere fact that a woman of her, lets say unique perspective can become a popular cultural figure is a sure sign of progress in a certain sense. Additionally having a woman as a lead in a genre dominated by hetero-normative male tropes is beguiling, but in the case of Spy it's not only a missed opportunity, its a ruse and not a clever one either.Let us start at the beginning. McCarthy plays a talented CIA analyst who is often paired up and runs interference for a suave, sophisticated field agent (Law). However after the agent's untimely death, the CIA quickly realizes that all their best agents are compromised. The only way they can recover a stolen nuclear weapon from a nefarious arms dealer is to put McCarthy's Susan into the field to gather intelligence and possibly save the world.What could have been a truly ballsy, subversive routine ends up being a broad heckle from the sidelines. The first half of the movie consists of McCarthy's character being the butt of every mean spirited gag in the book. She's fat, she dresses poorly, she's homely etc. The thing is its not clever or thought out; its basically glorified improv; the director's excuse to let his players riff so he can cut everything together later. All of it sounds like the taunting of a dimwitted high school bully. Seriously, who acts this way without fully realizing their total dicks and impressing nobody. The only actor who is partially successful in balancing mean and funny is Jason Statham who by the last half-hour is transformed into a Falstaff-ian caricature lacking any real substance.In fact, all of the characters, including Susan do somersaults to fit the plot compromising character motivations, traits and interests. Susan snaps from a scared, introverted analyst to a foul- mouthed, ass-kicker with the sudden sound of a cocked handgun. Another character murders and witnesses the murder of multiple people yet is reluctant to pull the trigger on a shoe-horned comic- relief character (Hart) because of...reasons. Jason Statham's character quits the CIA then does his own investigation to stop the people who murdered a colleague he hated because of...reasons. Bobby Cannavale's character wants to blow up the U.N. because of...reasons. You see a pattern emerging here? No matter let's all watch a gregarious Italian man grope Melissa McCarthy again.The second act of the film consists of an escalating number of action set-pieces which offer nothing new to the genre; action, comedy, or otherwise. Its all so paint-by-numbers that rarely anything is given suspense. Even the jokes that pepper the chase sequences and close-quarters fighting are so painfully obvious, its hard not to let the mind wonder and miss the days of Austin Powers. By the third act all the dead horses are flogged and dead dogs boiled. All that's left to do is tag on convoluted double-crosses and swap allegiances a few times in the vein hope that the audience still cares about our all but ignored maguffin.My main problem with Spy is it completely fails to lampoon or undermine the point of spy films, instead replicating the same tired comedy- spy schtick that's been around since Casino Royale (1967). They're male fantasies that not only glamorize violence, they glamorize living life in a haze of grey. James Bond, Ethan Hunt, Jason Bourne et al, they embrace the peril of a lifestyle that shifts with the alliances of criminals, terrorists, governmental bodies and femme fatales. ""That's a Smith and Wesson and you've had your six,"" smirks Bond in Dr. No (1962) before killing a helpless assassin. They dispatch foes with the coolness of true professionals and we root for the characters despite their blood-lust. Spy seems so concerned with knocking on McCarthy's girth and gender that it fails to really get to why something like Mission: Impossible (1996) is a draw in the first place. Honestly, In Like Flint (1967) is post-actively a better take-down of sexism in action movies than Spy.There are worse movies than Spy to be sure. Far from a nadir in the genre, to be sure (I can fill a days worth of column inches with terrible spy/action comedy movies). If broad, lazy comedy is your particular brand of weak tea, you may well get your money's worth with Spy. Yet with folks raving that this newest McCarthy vehicle is some kind of feminist provocation, I simply had to clear the air and say it's simply not. Like almost all American comedy over the last ten years, Spy is just another improv session among a stock cast of players all hoping their game of ""park bench"" ends up in the theatrical cut. What could have been a shot across the bow to male- dominated cinema ended up being the flick of a paper football tossed by a pig-tailed girl asking politely if she can play. If I were you, I'd just take my ball and go home.",Spy
82,moviexclusive,"Even funnier than 'Bridesmaids', Melissa McCarthy reteams with writer-director Paul Feig for a riotous send-up of every cliché and stereotype you've had of the spy movie genre",8,16 May 2015,"Move over, James Bond. The coolest spy in town is the CIA's Susan Cooper, a rotound desk agent who looks and walks like Melissa McCarthy that is given her first field assignment to stop a Bulgarian arms dealer Rayna (Rose Bryne) from selling a rogue nuclear weapon to the highest bidding terrorist. While her textbook- suave male counterparts get to don tuxedos and hide behind cool aliases, Susan gets assigned to be a divorced mother-of-three from Iowa or a single woman living with ten cats in her apartment. Clearly, she isn't who you would normally associate with spy material, but hey that's precisely why writer- director Paul Feig's send-up of the genre is so, so funny.The official synopsis will let you know that Susan is called upon to assist the Agency when her assigned field agent, Bradley Fine (Jude Law), is killed in the call of duty by Rayna, the latter also threatening to know (and therefore kill) every single active field agent of the Agency has. So, from her vermin-infested basement where she acts as the eyes and ears for Bradley, Susan volunteers her anonymous self for a ""track and report only"" mission in Paris, where Rayna is supposed to meet with a notorious middleman named DeLuca (Bobby Cannavale). Needless to say, the enthusiastic former desk jockey steps out of the mission parameters very quickly, and throws herself right into the thick of the action, globetrotting across Europe to Rome and finally to Budapest in order to track down the missing nuke.As far as spoofs go, 'Spy' is surprisingly well-plotted. Instead of a catfight between McCarthy and Bryne, Feig has them form somewhat of an unlikely friendship somewhere during the middle act, as McCarthy pretends to be a bodyguard hired by Bryne's father to protect the latter. Watching Bryne's snobbish, judgmental Reyna trade verbal barbs at McCarthy's in-your-face, expletive-hurling Susan is a hoot, and their chemistry is even more delightful than discovering that Susan has an ""inner rage"" that makes her one hell of a mean fighter in the first place. Ditto it is to find out that Statham isn't just rehashing his action hero persona from the countless B-grade movies he's been of late, but instead sending it up by constantly exaggerating the things he has had to endure in the line of duty (like having to cut one arm off and sew it back with the other).From its James Bond-style title sequence, there is no doubt that Feig has his tongue firmly in his cheek. And yet unlike other send- ups, Feig plays his with a thoroughly straight face, and comes off all the better for it. At no point does it come off looking silly (just look at 'Austin Powers' as a counter-factual); quite the opposite, you might even be inclined at several points to call it brilliant, which only goes to show just how deftly Feig has managed the fine balance between farce and genius. Like his past two female- centric comedies, that genius lies also in Feig's gleeful lack of regard for political correctness, so those who cannot stand the pottiness of 'Bridesmaids' or 'The Heat' should know that this is likely to offend your delicate sensibilities as well.Yet if there's something these previous Feig-McCarthy collaborations have shown, it is that theirs is truly an inspired comedic pairing. It was Feig who first introduced us to McCarthy's foul-mouthed attitude in 'Bridesmaids', but as 'Identity Thief' and 'Tammy' showed, her trademark shtick can get tiresome and ingratiating very quickly without the right finesse. Feig knows exactly how far and when to push the right buttons, so that McCarthy's outward bravado never gets on your nerves. More than in her previous roles, there is palpable sense of insecurity to McCarthy's fish-out-of-water character here, and the highly gifted comedic actress delivers her most heartfelt performance portraying Susan's anxieties as she realises how way out of her league she is.In place of the ensemble in 'Bridesmaids' or the complement that Sandra Bullock was in 'The Heat', Feig surrounds McCarthy with a colourful cast of supporting characters. Statham and Law have a whale of a time with their winking performances, the former as a tough-talker and the latter as a debonair spy who isn't so perfect (heck, he accidentally kills the one man with the information he needs when he squeezes the trigger while sneezing). Bryne is gloriously bitchy, and like we said earlier, her scenes with McCarthy snap, crackle and pop. Other no less entertaining additions include Miranda Hart, who plays McCarthy's colleague down in the basement that harbours similar dreams of being out there in the action (her ideal codename being Amber Valentine no less), as well as British actor Peter Serafinowicz, who plays an amorous local CIA handler enlisted to help McCarthy while she is in Rome. Feig juggles all these distinct characters beautifully, while never ever forgetting that this is McCarthy's show through and through.If you're looking to be tickled silly, we guarantee that 'Spy' will leave you in stitches, but the real ingenuity in this espionage spoof is how it is never in itself silly. Indeed, its humour lies not in putting down its characters or by extension its actors, but rather by subverting our stereotypes of just who and how certain people are supposed to be. It is precisely because we do not expect someone of McCarthy's calibre to be a secret agent that we laugh at how wrong we were – and yes, contrary to what you may expect, McCarthy does get to kick ass, a lot of them. The same goes for each one of her other co-stars, whose characters are deliberately meant to be counter-intuitive. But hey, one can say precisely the same about 'Spy', which easily surpasses what Feig and McCarthy have done before. It is funny as hell all right, and it even has a genuinely exciting spy story in itself.",Spy
83,quincytheodore,"Jason Statham won't be cast as James Bond now, but he has a bright future in comedy",7,22 May 2015,"Spy has as much clumsy hilarity as James Bond has suave persona. It presents myriad of experienced actors from other genres doing bloopers for typical action flicks. While not all Melissa McCarthy's jokes pan out, she is a respectable lead role and the collective effort from the cast succeeds in creating a thoroughly amusing comedy, which in its best will take audience's breath and replacing them with constant laughter.Susan Cooper (Melissa McCarthy) is the handler of a brilliant spy Bradley Fine (Jude Law). After one botched operation, she finds herself tangled with criminal boss and assassins as she goes undercover to finish the task. There are a lot of jokes on her expense, mainly for her contrasting appearance to the glamorous life of spies. The fat jokes are quite funny and entertaining, though slightly overused. Much of the effective moments are from the absurdly rude dialogues dropped in expense of the characters.These best parts come from her interaction with other usually serious actors. It's definitely an over-the-top movie when the overly narcissistic Jude Law is probably the least peculiar character. He still carries the playboy attitude, and the movie decides he should channel this particular trait of James Bond. For the slightly antagonist character, Rose Bryne fills the spot. I had a hard time recognizing this once haunted housewife Renai Lambert from Insidious as she grudgingly stares, passionately curses and decides poorly like a syndicate boss would do.My personal favorite is Jason Statham. His role is so exaggerated, it may very well be inspired by Chuck Norris' jokes. The pathological urge to use profanity and his constant misplaced confidence are furthest things from his usual gimmick, yet he pulls it off with full conviction. For a comedy movie, some of the action sequences are actually presentable. Fights are well-choreographed, especially one particular knife battle.The excessive nature might not always work, but when Spy hits its stride, there's no stopping these inelegant incompetent agents from extracting laugh from audience.",Spy
84,Sergeant_Tibbs,"Feig handles comedy better than action, but McCarthy is surprisingly great at both.",6,8 August 2015,"Since Melissa McCarthy blew up in the mainstream eye in her dynamite supporting role in Bridesmaids, it feels like Hollywood has been relentlessly forcing her in the front seat to no avail. Reuniting with Paul Feig, they may have a subversive leading role that's right for her, though I'm not necessarily inviting a new franchise. With the dawn of a gritty and frankly better Bond, the spy genre is fresh for a kicking after not much action since Austin Powers. Unlike Powers, Spy thrives when it's not being an absurd spoof, for example whenever they're in the air and it gets ridiculous. It's best when it's focused on McCarthy's wit and vulnerability, shining brightest in the former when she has opportunities to insult Rose Byrne while undercover. It may be obvious in the way she fits firmly in the mold of an unlikely candidate for the role, but it works. But despite Feig's talents in casting (always a delight to see Bobby Cannavale) he struggles most in action scenes with punches not landing in convincing ways and the camera planted where it's difficult to locate the characters. Still, a solid comedy for McCarthy, which is nice to see, if nothing too memorable.6/10",Spy

This movie was so funny that I could not even keep from laughing. This movie is about a James Bond kind of guy that goes missing. Melissa McCarthy has to go undercover to find him. There are tons of funny sayings in this movie and a lot of good humor. One of my favorite parts was when McCarthy started cussing out Raina. That was really funny! Jason Statham really was funny to.

86,Screen_Blitz,"Tries too hard to be funny, but ultimately stumbles",4,26 September 2015,"In this action-comedy directed by Paul Feig who brought us Bridesmaids (2011) and The Heat (2013), Melissa McCarthy plays Susan Cooper, a CIA analyst who takes on a dangerous mission with her partner Bradley Fine (played by Jude Law) to capture an international terrorist named Sergio De Luca (played by Bobby Cannevale) who is in possession of nuclear weapons. When the mission goes terribly wrong, Cooper is partner with Rayna Boyanov (played by Rose Byrne), the daughter of one of De Luca's henchmen, assigned to travel to Paris undercover and stop the mastermind terrorist herself. Jason Statham plays Rick Ford, an arrogant secret agent who disagrees with Cooper's position as the undercover agent on the mission and stops at nothing to find De Luca and finish the mission himself. With hilarious Melissa McCarthy comedies like Bridesmaids and The Heat, I had much confidence in this film, especially upon watching the trailer with Jude Law's character accidentally shooting a terrorist after sneezing. Unfortunately, my expectations sadly fell short. There is no denying that there were some funny scenes with Melissa McCarthy and Rose Byrne, but not very many. The chemistry between these two felt rather weak and ineffective. The humor and dialogue is in this film is a bit stale, and the problem is that this movie tries to be funny by constantly using non-stop expletives without adding any real humor to them, and it just doesn't work. Characters using vulgar sex humor is not problem as long as they make them in a way that is funny. Sadly, the film fails to accomplish this, the characters just swear in a way that serves no purpose. Jason Statham doesn't even manage to be funny in this either. Don't get wrong, there is some shades of humor here and there, but enough to make it satisfying. Spy is not what I would describe as a bad movie, but rather a movie that wasted lots of potential on a poorly written script. Melissa McCarthy may enjoy this, some will not. There were a few scenes that had me laughing, but overall, I was quite disappointed in this.",Spy
87,Troy_Campbell,"It's not always funny, but when it is, it's downright hilarious.",7,21 May 2015,"Melissa McCarthy has one of the most impressive potty mouths in cinema. The gloriously self-deprecating comedienne fires off f-bombs that would make Samuel L. Jackson jealous. McCarthy's acerbic dialogue, coupled with her innate knack for physical comedy, ensures this espionage spoof is nothing short of enjoyable, if not memorable. The carefree plot is irrelevant and lacks the biting commentary on spy flicks that the superior Kingsman provided, yet it capably achieves its aim of propelling McCarthy from one gag to the next. Paul Feig yet again delivers a bloated runtime (see Bridesmaids and The Heat), although generates enough laugh-out-loud humour in his script to largely make up for it. But this film really belongs to the on-song cast, with the rib-tickling McCarthy receiving excellent support. Rose Byrne nails it as the condescendingly caustic villain, Jude Law admirably takes the mickey out of himself, and Jason Statham – who snares the movie's best moment with an uproariously macho monologue – is downright hilarious as an obnoxious agent. Spy has its share of filmic flaws and jokes that fall flat, but when it's funny it's really funny; which, thanks to its marvellous cast, is more often than not.",Spy
88,pyrocitor,Limp-d*ck unicorn,7,25 November 2015,"Melissa McCarthy may as well be a genre unto herself these days. After applying her somehow-still-not-tired schtick of foul-mouthed slapstick with an undercurrent of sweetness to weddings and buddy cop capers alike, it's a pretty seamless transition into the pantheon of Bond spoofs that increasingly run the risk of outperforming 007 himself. Spy, like many of its genre/gender bending contemporaries, manages to hit that sweet spot middle point between 'throwaway star vehicle' and 'more than the sum of its parts' – derivative, largely forgettable, but fun and funky enough to be worth its weight in exploding hemorrhoid removal cream. Writer/director Paul Feig is clearly motivated by taking the p*ss out of the notoriously misogynist Bond tradition, but is canny with his feminism. Here we have the timeworn spy caper framework, but inhabited by a female lead, comedic relief sidekick, villain, and curmudgeonly superior. But Feig never makes a big thing of it, allowing the inevitable gender politics to play themselves out without any fuss, sans grandiose statement. It helps, of course, to gird the whole shebang with prime spoofery, including some genuinely engaging globetrotting action sequences (though the bursts of shockingly graphic gore take it a step too far), and even its very own (impressively catchy) Bondian title track. It's the sign of a good parody when there are bits when you catch yourself getting nearly too swept up to remember it's meant to poke fun at the genre you're enjoying. Savvy audiences will know to come for the pastiche and stay for the gags, though. And while Feig has yet to escape from the Judd Apatow shroud of flabby editing and sequences of excessively generous riffing (and a 130 minute running time – at least 20 too long – is indulgent indeed), he specializes in the cutaway gag, of which Spy is chock-full. Some zany (""the rats have wings!""), some gross, some which veer from one into the other and back again (""oh god, not on him, not ON him!""), Spy proves 2015's repository of daft comedic quotes to beat – you can practically make a short film out of the deranged, boasting rants of Jason Statham's exquisitely oblivious rogue agent alone. Overlong and clumsy as the results may be, the 'throw spaghetti at the wall and see what sticks' approach to comedy is, nonetheless, bound to win laughs from just about everyone at some point or another. If anything, Feig has enthusiastically assembled such a stellar ensemble cast that the proceedings grow almost worrisomely overcrowded at times, but too much of a good thing is still a fairly welcome complaint. McCarthy herself remains the highlight, with a ferociously enjoyable leading performance that weaves in her recurring archetypes of mousy lovable loser and bombastic, elaborate-threat-spewing piledriver, and somehow grounds both in an impressively believable and endearing character near impossible not to take to. Rose Byrne is an impressively terrifying scene-stealer as the resident ice queen evil mastermind, almost as frightful when scathingly critiquing McCarthy's wardrobe as menacing undercover agents with a gun, and Feig is wise enough to let her and McCarthy rip into one another with enough voraciously trash-talking banter to make Goldfinger blush. Miranda Hart's sweetly awkward act toes the line of overuse as McCarthy's sidekick, but wins enough genuinely unexpected guffaws to be well worth her while, while Statham is consistent comedic gold, lampooning his action man persona like a champ. Jude Law, naturally, was born to live and breathe 'Bond- without-Bond', and Allison Janney grumbles like the best of them as the surprisingly unfussy CIA director, while Peter Serafinowicz is reliably hysterical as a boorish Italian(?) agent, even if Bobby Cannavale's slick arms dealer feels like an extraneous dud of a last minute threat. Spy flounders a bit with one or two twists, plot lines, or characters too many, lacking the taut precision that would elevate it to the Hot Fuzz calibre of classic spoof. Nonetheless, Feig and McCarthy continue to be a modest dream team of reliable laughs and nonchalantly progressive genre tweaking, and their see-sawing between clever, goofy, crass, and sweet still has mileage aplenty. As loathe as I am to admit it in the epoch of unwarranted sequels, Susan Cooper could prove a concoction who – shock! gasp! (I'm going to kick myself for this later) – wouldn't be too abhorrent to cinematically (only) live twice. Even better: I ain't 'fraid of no ghosts! Bring the noise.-7/10",Spy
89,vithiet,Entertaining and mostly funny,7,28 November 2020,"Definitely not the best comedy around but it's entertaining enough and I got a few laughs out of it. Would be more of a 6/10 but the actors are all doing a great job, even if towards the end each of their respective shtick becomes a little repetitive. But it's still pretty entertaining overall.",Spy
90,Stephen_A_Abell,Mostly Unfunny Though Well Filmed...,5,3 March 2018,"So here we have another very unfunny comedy film. Why is it people think swearing out of context is funny. Swearing can be much more comedic when handled as part of a witty dialogue. Then, of course, there are the standard poo jokes. The even more used machismo parodies. Based on the over-utilised underdog that learns to bite back and roar like a lion storyline. With a twist that's so obvious, it's actually not a twist. This is just a mash-up of the usual elements, however, writer and director Paul Feig does give us something new with them, he actually makes them boring. Throughout the entire film, there were three places that made me smile and only one that made me laugh... and that was towards the end - a long time to wait.Though I will say this for Feig, he really can direct a film. The only thing which keeps this movie interesting is the direction. There are quite a few decent camera shots and angles, well lighted and composed. He's also pretty good at action. The fight scenes are spot on and the chase sequences are excitingly filmed. If it weren't for this and the cast the film would be a real dud.As for the acting, this was below par for most of the cast. And it was the lead role of Susan Cooper (McCarthy) which spoils the film, instead of strengthening it. This is mainly because McCarthy plays McCarthy: Most of the characters she's played to date can be easily interchanged between their films, as there are very few differences. It would be nice to see her stretch her acting wings in her next role. Maybe if she actually had a good script and an original character to work with...I watched this for Miranda; I wondered how good she would be in a movie. She wasn't too bad; it was her scene that made me laugh, but there wasn't much to stretch her skills here. And, for Jason Statham, as I've been a fan since I saw him in The One. He has grown as an actor throughout his career, though, this feels like a few steps backwards.If you're a McCarthy fan you should like this though it'll feel all too familiar, at times. As for everybody else, it's an okay way to waste some time if you've got nothing better to do.",Spy
91,brchthethird,A hilarious return to form for Melissa McCarthy,9,3 October 2015,"Just when I was ready to give up on Melissa McCarthy for running her shtick into the ground, she surprises me this gem of a comedy. Melissa McCarthy stars as Susan Cooper, a single woman who works behind a desk for the CIA. When the identities of all active agents are compromised, she enters the field to track down an arms dealer looking to sell a nuclear bomb. Spy movies don't really rank high among my favorite genres (although Daniel Craig as Bond is definitely changing that), but this SPY's main selling point (among many) is that it knows how silly it is and just plays along. If one were to critique SPY on its plot, of course one would conclude that it's convoluted and nonsensical. However, the comedic writing and performances are all top-notch here, making considerations of plot almost irrelevant. My main issue with McCarthy before was her excessively profane, loud and obnoxious screen persona. Thankfully, she tones it down a lot here and goes for a more subtle approach. Her character does kind of become more outre as the film progresses, but it was organic to the central theme of a woman coming into her own in a male-dominated profession. In terms of exploring that, Rose Byrne (NEIGHBORS) plays very well opposite McCarthy as the arms dealer that Cooper is after. Even though they're on opposite sides of the law, they share a bond over being taking seriously as professionals in their respective fields, so to speak. There was even great comic work from non-comic actors like Jude Law and Jason Statham, who is essentially parodying his action star roles. It was over-the-top, but oh so funny. I also liked Alison Janney as Susan Cooper's CIA boss. Outside of the writing and acting, all of the technical bits were well-done, if unspectacular, and the action was well-choreographed. There were a few moments where the CGI didn't look so great, but the cheesy nature of the effects kind of fit with the overblown satirical comedy that film was going for. Finally, there was some pacing issues towards the end of the second act, and the beginning of the third. Maybe 5-10 minutes could have trimmed, but I was laughing so much I barely noticed. Overall, SPY is perhaps the second best comedy I've seen this year (behind KINGSMAN). It was able to take a comedian who I was beginning to tire of, and make her funny again. It also was just plain hilarious the whole way through, and definitely worth your time/money.",Spy
92,maurice_yacowar,CIA female clerk becomes anti-convention spy,8,6 June 2015,"In addition to being hilariously funny, Paul Feig's Spy is a brilliant feminist response to the James Bond genre. The opening scene, the exotic locales, the plot, the music, the character types, all evoke the Bonds which spawned a cycle of international bed- hopping suave heroes saving the world and the hinge-heeled beauties who crave him. This female spy turns all those male clichés into fresh female successes.The title works two ways. It obviously declares itself a spy film but more broadly addresses ""the male gaze,"" the theory that films assume a masculine perspective and make the female the object of their vision, not their own subject. As watchers we are the espyers, the spy, safely ogling the characters from our privileged privacy. When we watch Spy we are spying from the traditional male perspective — but here the advantage is given woman. Susan's camera contact lens is an emblem of scopophilia.Melissa McCarthy's Susan Cooper is not the genre's usual woman. But her bulk does not deter her from intelligence, stamina, energy, imagination, effectiveness in physical battle, and even winning the desire of all the macho men in the film. Her ample bosom is not maternal but sexy. The men by reflex find reasons to grab and ogle it. In Bond's world she'd be Boobs Galore. She's no Modesty Blaise. The lecherous Aldo's flirtatious routine expresses the emotional attraction both male spies discover for her. When she ends up in bed with the ridiculous Rick Ford, she confirms her right to the sexual liberty — even caprice — usually reserved for the male stars.Susan was inhibited in her early CIA career by male authority. Now she has a chance to fulfil herself, as she steps from directing spy Bradley Fine by audio remote control to flying into the field herself. She fights through every possible restriction. She even ploughs her borrowed motorcycle through a furrow of freshly poured concrete — as tough as surviving the CIA's prejudice against women and the western culture's narrow prescription of feminine beauty. Susan saves the world, saves her beloved Bradley, wins the career she always craved — but even in her post-victory her new undercover characters remain consigned to boring cliché.She's also a woman with a voice — as independent, aggressive, witty, profane, as any man in that world. In fact her rapid-fire coarse wit evokes the Veep TV series (and its clear advantage over the stodgy old-fashioned Tomlin-Fonda warhorse on Netflix). The substantial wit of the plot is deepened and enhanced by the dialogue, which is off-the- wall, inventive, and always funny. That extends into the case histories chronicled behind the end-credits (stay for them). Susan's blossoming from clerk to action hero contrasts to the other three woman. The CIA unit director is the familiar woman administrator, brusque, officious, eager to subordinate her women charges to the men's needs. Susan's colleague and best friend Nancy (a brutally deglamorized Miranda Hart) is a plain-Jane Miss Moneypenny, who under Susan's example comes into her own, saving Susan's life, killing a villain, and even seducing rapper Fifty Cent. That's qualitatively more money than the money penny. The CIA's dazzling perfect beauty spy proves as false as the genre's feminine allure, proving herself a traitor. Our admiration and empathy are invested in the beauty that's conventionally denied. The evil Rayna is as tough, heartless and dangerous as all the Bond master villains. She is as independent and foul-mouthed as Susan, as worthy an adversary as Dr. Noh and Goldfinger. Like the conventional heroine, Rayna runs for her life — tottering upon her silted heels. The CIA director, Nancy and Rayna have an image-consciousness that underscores Susan's deeply inculcated — and reductive — humility. The male figures also undercut the genre convention. The Bond figure is suave Bradley Fine (Jude Law), a ladykiller brutally insensitive to Susan's ardor for him — except to exploit it. As Rick Ford action star Jason Statham caricatures his persona, a macho, strutting, mysogynous ""hero"" who goes rogue to solve the case. Here he proves absolutely incompetent. Here this male action star plays the usual female bimbo. Susan saves both macho heroes and in turn is saved by Nancy. As Ford is a comic exposure of Fine, Susan exposes both. Thus the film exposes the traditional assumption that men command the proper authority and efficacy in solving the world's problems. That assumption is our cultural bias and weakness not a reality.",Spy
93,thekarmicnomad,Childish but funny.,9,15 August 2015,"I must admit I was not looking forward to this at all. I was expecting two hours of ""lets all point and laugh at the fat girl"" with some added knob gags.That isn't too far from the mark; it is crude and the main character is picked on quite a lot, but is seldom the butt of the jokes. In a world of super skinny models and implausible macho tough guys she is obviously the sane one. Statham and Law do a great job of sending up the two hero archetypes (the gritty violent hard-man and the dashing, suave rouge) and have great fun with it.The movie does swerve dangerously close to Scary Movie territory in parts but doesn't ever go all the way.This is good fun, the arguments and put downs are ferocious and witty. All the characters are send-up stereotypes. I did find it got a bit grating at the end as the jokes get piled on a bit heavy - I would have liked it more if it had ended ten minutes earlier. I laughed a lot - my girlfriend thought it was a bit silly and the bits i laughed at were childish - but she enjoyed it also.",Spy
94,Karl Self,License to be unimpressive,3,15 March 2016,"This movie is based on a nice comical idea -- In a James Bond-esque world of supermen and supermolls, a chubby, middle-aged underling has to mingle in. Unfortunately, the fun stopped at the idea and never translated into a proper script with witty dialogues. For large parts of the movie, we see Melissa McCarthy (as efficient deskworker Susan Cooper) bumbling alongside the evil dreamboats Jude Law (CIA superagent Bradley Fine) and Rose Byrne (as sexy supervillain Rayna Boyanov). For example, there is one ""trustbuilding"" scene in which Rayna tells Susan that she reminds her of her mother, which Susan fails to take as a compliment. That scene drags on for what feels like 10 minutes, with Rayna describing her mother in increasingly grotesque ways. It's like one of those jokes among colleagues that take a terribly wrong turn, where no-one wants to lose face and simply end it.To really mess up the comedy, the producers decided to pull a Kevin James on us, and try to make us believe that, at least for a fleeting moment, Susan is not just a nice but average person, but that she really is on a par with her supercilious competitors. That the reason why she didn't cut it as a superagent is discrimination and a lack of self-confidence. That there is a snowball's chance in hell that Jude Law is sexually attracted to her simply because she is such a good chum. Jude Law's flirtations with her are shown not as friendly but inconsequential, but as deceitful. We've seen this make-believe plot a hundred times before with an average guy being chased by perfect 10-women, this time it's the other way around, but it doesn't make it any better.Bridesmaids was crass and super funny, but there's nothing left of that in Paul Feig's latest offering. Ultimately, it's maybe 10 minutes of fun and entertainment in a 90-minute movie.",Spy
95,PartialMovieViewer,The Best Movie I Have Ever Seen in My Life,10,12 June 2015,"This review is taking on water fast...I might as well sink it completely. Allow me to preface this review with stuffyou knowI want to share my negativities. First, I am not really a fan of Melissa McCarthy, nor am I huge fan of Jude Law; second, Paul Feig is far from my favorite director, and third, Jason Statham seems so not-right for this movie. With all this working against the production, I actually had to work very hard NOT to like, 'Spy.' So now that I laid out my crowI now must eat the stupid bird. Oh – and that also ends my preface.Mr. Feig did a pretty good job writing and directing, 'Spy.' A fast paced and enjoyable action-adventure-comedy, this movie kept my attention from beginning to end. Other than a couple of choice – unfunny comedic moments, McCarthy held it together and was funny and interesting. Shockingly, I assumed this product would end up being an extension of the movie, 'Heat,' packed full of pointless obscenities and toilet humor. If that had been the caseI would have left two minutes into it. Granted – profanity was present – but there had to be some since toilet humor tends to be Melissa's most venerable and recognizable characteristic. I feel McCarthy did a good job this time.Let's see, what do I not like about Jude Law? Nothing really. I don't think he is one of the greatest actors ever to live nor do I think he is one of the worst. I just have not seen enough of him to have a strong opinion one way or the other. I did like his character in this movie though. He definitely had that James Bond thing down to a 'T'. Very cool performance – I think the proper descriptive words for his performance are suave and debonair – or shaken – not stirred. Anyways, the guy is a natural English super-spy.So where is the real comedy? HmmmmJason Statham maybe. In my opinion the man carried the entire show. The movie might have belonged to the pair above, but Statham kept it from failing. Once Jason started jabbering, I could not stop laughing, his comedic timing was perfect. I actually work with people who are the same sort of 'experts.' As over-the-top his character appears, in some cases, it is spot-on. Super-Spy Rick Ford was responsible for all the big laughs and success.Overall this is not a bad movie - the positive side of mediocre - but I had to rate it 10/10 to get the most thumbs down - ever. If you have kids, I think there is enough profanity, I would keep them away. If you strongly judge movies on feasibility – this is definitely not for you – stay away. If you do not like Melissa McCarthy – I would give this a try. Rent it – and if you don't like it – the loss is not crippling. It is not for everyone, but I had a blast. Not the best flick out there – but a good time killer.",Spy
96,phubbs,Spy,4,11 November 2015,"OK, so this looks like an interes...oh my God! its another bloody Bond parody!! seriously!!! Yes the modern age feminist hipster, Paul Feig, takes a swing at the Bond genre, and oh what an original concept that is, gee I wonder what we'll see here...ugh!So naturally its an adult comedy with lashings of semi-serious action, CGI blood, swearing and a whole heap of Melissa McCarthy and other actresses. Basically the plot revolves around McCarthy playing Cooper, a desk jockey CIA analyst who helps the very suave, completely clichéd character of Fine played by Jude Law. Yep, if you ever wanted to see what it would be like having Jude Law as Bond, well here you go. After a botched mission Fine is supposedly killed off and the CIA need someone to take his place, an unknown, hence they can't use Statham who plays another totally clichéd agent character we've all seen before. We then follow Cooper around as she slowly but surely sinks deeper and deeper into a mission, which she was never really suppose to get into in the first place (she was only meant to be surveillance).Oh geez where to start, the plot is unoriginal sure, we all know that, but how about some original ideas...oh too late. From the very first scene I had a good idea what this film was aiming at and how the characters would play out. Spoiler alert! but the minute you see Law as this debonair spy, you know he's obviously gonna die early on, he's clearly the plot setup for McCarthy's Cooper, I mean come on, who didn't see that?! But wait! as the film progresses and more and more characters are introduced, we start to see double agents and characters popping up outta nowhere who are suddenly spies or assassins. All of sudden characters we saw at the start who appeared to just be the butt of a joke or background fodder, are now main characters out to kill the protagonist. Its at this point you know that anyone is fair game and anyone can surprisingly come back from the dead when you thought they had been killed off. So I quickly realised that Jude Law probably wasn't dead at all. Seeing as we didn't actually see him die, clearly he can come back, and he did...*groan*The plot is a mess of characters bouncing back and forth between the goodies and the baddies. Seriously, there are characters popping up all over the place, getting whacked, and then replaced minutes later by new ones, only to get killed just as quickly. The ones that don't get killed, you just know are probably gonna turn out to be secret agents, but on either side. I honesty thought Law's character of Fine was gonna keep flippin' sides! he was a goodie, then a baddie, then a goodie again, but at this point I genuinely suspected he would turn on Cooper yet again right at the death, and then get properly killed off. Amazingly the film beat me on that one, but this film could of kept spinning these characters round and round, one double agent twist after another.The actual characters are a completely mixed bag of nuts that all had one thing in common, none of them managed to actually make me laugh...at any point. McCarthy was...well, pretty much like McCarthy is in every bloody movie she's ever done (whilst looking oddly like Dawn French at one point), whilst her sidekick, played by Brit Miranda Hart, was just simply annoying and unfunny. I swear, an early scene near the start has McCarthy and Law in conversation at dinner, they are both talking about themselves and offering basic foreshadowing of things to come. Now initially there are moments that made me smile (as there were throughout this film), but this obviously intended funny sequence just went on and on and on...it just didn't f*cking stop. Like seriously, the moment has passed, the joke is over, its not funny anymore its just awkwardly embarrassing, stop flogging this dead horse!!The only characters that did offer some genuine giggles were Statham as a dumb, cocky but tough agent, nothing gobsmackingly funny mind you, but reasonable. Next to him I quite liked Peter Serafinowicz as the slimy Italian (yet another secret agent) Aldo who can't keep his hands off the ladies. Sure this character felt like a cheesy 'Carry- On' character (something I would of thought was beyond the realms of acceptance for Feig), but his antics were amusing. Other than that everyone was just there, doing exactly what you expected them to be doing with these character types. Get a load of Law by the way, how much flippin' makeup?? Oh and both Statham and the main baddie fall into the lake from that helicopter at the end, so why does only Statham survive?I know this movie was relatively successful but I don't really understand why. Yes some parts were good such as the gadgets sequence near the start which is obviously yet more parodies of a certain franchise, and I did quite like how the main female villain was a spoilt bratty Princess type, although again that did become annoying at times too. But in general everything just felt very generic to me and relied far too much on feeble visual gags including male genitals and slapstick, lots of profanity and lots of weight/looks shaming jabs. Even the inclusion of lots of blood and a bit of gore didn't do anything for me, that just felt unnecessary and shoved in to appease the male audience. I would say this was more enjoyable than 'The Heat' which was pretty dire, but at the end of the day, I found this to be an infantile, factory assembly line, cookie cutter of a flick.4.5/10",Spy
97,aciessi,Shaken Up and Stirred,6,12 June 2015,"This is the biggest surprise this summer. Spy is a witty, engaging and just plain goofy pie-in- the-face to the Spy genre. But it's parody is so lovingly done by Paul Feig, it could work as a stand-alone crime thriller. This is Melissa McCarthy in prime form. Contrary to what you might think, her human punching bag days are over. You could forget ""Tammy"" and ""Identity Thief"" ever happened, because this movie hones in her skill as a comedienne, an actress and a force to be reckoned with, perhaps almost as well as she did in her debut in Bridesmaids. Her camaraderie with everyone on screen works so well, because her charm, wit, and honest to God beauty is undeniable. If there's anyone else to talk about, it's Jason Statham, who steals the show in every scene he's in. He knocks every laugh out of the park. The advertisements serve the film no justice, for I was skeptical too, judging by how poorly they looked. Watch it, and have a good laugh.",Spy

99,RforFilm,Spy takes plenty of hits at all the spy clichès with enough wit and laughs to recommend,8,8 June 2015,"The way that my friends speak, they seem rather questionable to the idea of a woman playing James Bond. They seem to have no problem with changing the race or ethnicity of the famous hero, but when I brought up the idea of a woman taking over, their first response was to shiver and say quietly, ""I don't know about a female Bond"". At first I thought that they were taking an anti-feminist stance against such an idea. Would it not be possible for a woman spy to infiltrate a terrorist hideout or seduce an enemy agent to get information? I've always felt so.Today's movie Spy is all about playing up the joke that a woman is becoming a spy. Had they picked a Scarlett Johansson or an Angelina Jolie, then most people would have responded that female spies have already been done and that at lest in cinematic terms, we've been holding back more then were worth. Luckily, director Paul Feig was smart to cast someone who was even less likely to even qualify as a spy, Melissa McCarthy (a veteran of his previous films Bridesmaids and The Heat). Spy has it's mystery and laughs ready to go, but does it manage to mix it well?Susan Cooper (played by Melissa McCarthy) is a former teacher who enrolled in the CIA hoping to change her life and make it more exciting. She's saddled with a desk job as an analyst to work behind the scenes for her friend field agent, Bradley Fine (played by Jude Law) whose more of the typical James Bond-like spy that Cooper wishes she could be. A failed mission results in Fine having to sneak into the home of Rayna Boyanov (played by Rose Byrne) to retrieve information on the location of a nuke bomb. This too ends in failure as Fine is supposedly shot to death.Not only is her friend dead, but her boss Elaine Crocker (played by Alison Janney) reveals that Rayna already knows most of the identities of the top field agents. Seeing that no one would suspect her, Cooper volunteers to become a field agent. This doesn't suit well with the other hotshot (not to mention hothead) agent Rick Ford (played by Jason Statham), but Cooper is assigned to go to Europe to go after Rayna. Cooper manages to get in deeper with Rayna and her colleagues much more with her friendly, but intimidating attitude and just might pull off a successful mission.Spy is a lot like Bridesmaids and The Heat; all three have Mellissa McCarthy playing a big part and put this woman in a position that would usually be played by the goofy man. My fear was that McCarthy would play the same crass woman that I've seen before, but that does not seem to be the case for Spy. She's more of an unappreciated underdog who also happens to be good at what she's doing. It may have taken me a couple of movies but McCarthy has finally proved me a funny comedian.What makes Spy work is that this isn't just McCarthy's spotlight; Everyone gets some good scene-stealers (my favorite being Jason Statham constantly ranting about his nearly impossible stunts). Is it as masterful as Bridesmaids? No as this film stumbles into it's own problem of stopping the story to tell more jokes. Why couldn't most of the jokes progress the story? Oh well, it doesn't totally dampen this movie. As far as spy movies go, this plays off of every spy movie cliché from the animated intro with a sexy song to the exotic locations and high tech gadgets. Spy balances on the line between comedy and full blown satire.I'll give this eight scooters with roofs out of ten. I laughed harder for Spy then I did for the Heat, though not as much as Bridesmaids. Perhaps Paul Feig might want to consider branching out into other fields of comedy as not to remain predictable. For what it is, I'd say that Spy is a mission to go!.",Spy

I suppose it's fair to say that he does play a very particular type of character and if you like that then you will not have the same reservations.As for the film itself it does have it's moments, but falls somewhere between Austin Powers and James Bond.

102,Danusha_Goska,Funny; Worth Seeing,7,15 June 2015,"I was really surprised by ""Spy."" I was surprised because it's billed as a comedy, and I actually laughed out loud, and there was laughter in the theater throughout the film. I can't remember the last time I went to see a new release comedy and that happened. The humor in ""Spy"" is surprisingly gentle and light hearted. That's surprising because the filmmakers apparently felt it was necessary to build a violent, obscene movie around jokes that a ten-year-old could enjoy while watching the movie with her grandmother. Melissa McCarthy is famously fat, and female, and there is no way males are going to go see a movie starring a fat woman in the numbers box office bean counters want, so the filmmakers added lots of violence and obscene language. That's unfortunate. I know some people who could and would enjoy this movie but they'll never see it because of the violence. Plot: Melissa McCarthy plays Susan Cooper, a CIA agent who is the voice in the earpiece of glamorous field agent Bradley Fine (Jude Law). Fine is obviously based on James Bond. The joke is that every move he makes is directed by Cooper, sitting behind her desk at CIA headquarters. Events conspire to get Cooper out from behind her desk and in the field in glamorous European capitals. She must prevent Chechens from buying a nuclear bomb. It's a James Bond style plot built around Susan's funny character. A good number of the jokes in the movie concern Melissa McCarthy's weight. Again, I didn't think I'd find these jokes funny, but I did. The butt of the joke is not McCarthy, but how skinnier and prettier people treat a fat woman. The butt of the joke is their stupid prejudice against fat women. The CIA assigns Susan a series of aliases all built around her being a fat loser. One is an ""unemployed telemarketer with ten cats."" Susan, though, is really heroic and competent. McCarthy is very charming and lovable. You root for her and you are happy when she succeeds. Jason Statham is hysterical in a small role. He is a living combination of Chuck Norris / Most Interesting Man in the World jokes. Jude Law is a perfect stand-in for James Bond. Peter Serafinowicz, whose distinctive last name I remember from a Holocaust memoir, is very funny as a stereotypical Italian. (Serafinowicz is the grandson of a war criminal.) Alison Janney is terrific. This movie is good enough that I've already decided to go see the inevitable sequel. PS: the posters that depict McCarthy as a secondary character are misleading. She is the film's star. Just goes to show you how fearful the marketers are that no one will go to see a movie with a fat, female star. That's a shame. McCarthy is a gem.",Spy
103,silvermistvio,Less serious spy film.,5,9 October 2019,"Spy is a flim produced in 2015. Normally, I don't really watch old films. But I watched it anyway. The reason why I watched this film was because of Jude Law. Recently, I watched Contagion which was also Jude Law was in. And then I found out this film. Plus, I saw this one on a website and I felt like it's going to be a good film, so, I chose to watch it.The film is basically fine. And it's funny. But some of the words and actions are unbearable. So, I closed my eyes when those scenes came. I even felt like ashamed. And also there are a lot of f words which make me uncomfortable to listen to. Moreover, I feel like it's kind of copied from James Bond's films. Maybe it's because of the theme song part. That scene reminded me of James Bond films.That being said, this film makes a good one because it's all about actions and CIA things. Maybe that was also the reason why I watched this one. The actions are cool and some scenes are amazing. I kind of loved it.To say it in overall, this film is a little bit less serious. But it's so much fun. Hence, it's not that much a great film but enjoyable and watchable. I kind of enjoyed it because it's full of funny things. But for some reasons that made me not to like this film that much, I only gave this one 5 stars.",Spy
104,bryank-04844,'Spy' is another victory for the Feig and McCarthy team.,8,27 July 2015,"Director Paul Feig and actress Melissa McCarthy make one hell of a team. Since 'Bridesmaids', this duo have struck box office gold. It seems like Feig loves putting McCarthy in very similar roles, particularly a character who works for law enforcement or some government intelligence agency. In 'Bridesmaids', McCarthy's character was a CIA analyst who had the codes for all the nukes. In 'The Heat', she was a hardcore Boston police officer and detective.Now, in 'Spy', she's an FBI agent. With the previous two films, there wasn't a spy element to them, but with 'Spy', Feig made his very own 'James Bond' film, complete with a killer opening song and animated opening credit sequence, but instead of Daniel Craig, we have the wonderful Melissa McCarthy. Well, before we get to McCarthy, we have Jude Law as Bradley Fine (in an American accent), the closest thing we get to 007. McCarthy plays Susan Cooper, who is set in the FBI office in front of a computer, giving Fine directions in his ear piece to keep him from harm.Due to some unfortunate circumstances with Fine, Susan must go undercover to find a man named Sergio (Bobby Cannavale) and an evil woman named Rayna (Rose Byrne), who are in cahoots to acquire a nuclear weapon. Little did anyone know that Susan is in fact a badass in the field and can take out a few bad guys of her own, even if her undercover alias wears cat sweaters and old lady wigs. Susan going undercover truly angers Rick Ford (Jason Statham), another FBI agent who is a complete badass, because he feels, she'll just get in his way. Let me just say this right now, this is the best use of Jason Statham in an action movie I've ever seen.In the beginning of the film, McCarthy is as always funny, but her trademark 'R' rated dialogue doesn't kick in until she she lets loose in her awesome black outfit and she shows that she can kick some serious ass. The laughs keep coming throughout the film from McCarthy, Statham, Byrne, and McCarthy's friend at the agency Nancy (the awesome Miranda Hart). I know Feig lets McCarthy let loose a lot in the form of improv, and here she just kills it. I was laughing so hard, I had tears.Now since this is a spy film in the very same vein as 007 James Bond, there are in fact quite a few suspenseful moments, homages to the bond movies, some great twists and turns, and some awesome fight sequences, all in which were filmed very well with McCarthy in mind. Speaking of McCarthy, she plays an excellent character here. Her performance here is among my favorites of her resume, because she delivers a realness to her character with flaws and all. Everyone else turns in great performances as well here, specifically Jason Statham, who might be my favorite character in a movie this year.'Spy' is another victory for the Feig and McCarthy team. It's hilarious from start to finish and quite fun. If Bond ever met Susan Cooper, he would have his work cut out for him.Highly Recommended!",Spy
105,Movie-Misfit,Still hilarious after repeated viewings!!,8,21 July 2019,"In what is quite possibly Melissa McCarthy's funniest film to date, Spy pokes an obvious finger at the James Bond empire offering up a great mix of hilarious gags, likeable characters and well executed action scenes.And it is with the latter that I enjoyed the film even more, as McCarthy takes what screen time she can in getting her hands dirty and doing a lot of the action herself!For me, its rare today for a modern comedy to have me laughing continuously the whole way through, but Spy does this over and over again.Yes its camp, its rude, its silly and features a cameo by my favourite Eurovision winner, but it works. Action hard nut Statham takes the piss out of himself with glee, as the rest of the cast enjoy playing larger than life characters that bounce off each other well.Spy - whether viewed in its theatrical or extended version - just never lets up, with memorable moments and quotes coming at you every few seconds!If you don't find this funny, maybe you need to have your chuckle muscle checked...",Spy

And they will also be disappointed, because the film has nothing else. Yes, this is a comedy, and it is very difficult to come up with something new and unique in this genre. But the delusivity of the plot and situations causes a desire to interrupt viewing only intensifies. The film is served as a comedy action movie, but I saw comedies here only in a couple of scenes, and the action movie here is toy. The only thing that succeeded in the film is the main character. Melissa McCarthy played her role perfectly.",Spy

Some nail it (Johnny English), and some miss badly (the Austin Powers sequels). This one was just plain perfect.

However, it was the next movie playing so I took the plunge.I didn't hate it, but I didn't enjoy it that much either. I really just didn't appreciate the humour of a fat wise-cracking American woman playing a James Bond spy. Of course, she turns out to be clever and not inept at all.I thought it was on the lame side. It lacked wit and intelligence. I barely laughed at all, and I don't really understand those who said they laughed throughout the movie. I suppose you have to buy into Melissa McCarthy's schtick to enjoy this, and I just don't. It's not a total bomb, but I wouldn't recommend it either. Her brand of humour is just not my thing.",Spy
109,SquigglyCrunch,"Just Another Secret Agent Movie, but Still Funny",6,26 January 2016,"I actually really wanted to see this movie when it first came out. Considering I really enjoyed Kingsman: The Secret Service, another 2015 spy-comedy, I was hoping for something great. Unfortunately, it really isn't anything special. The plot of Spy is pretty average. The new spy has to stop a nuclear weapon from being sold and causing bad things to happens and ends up going on a little adventure, where everything goes wrong but still works out anyways. It's quite predictable for the most part, but some parts were still at least a little unexpected. The characters are pretty average. Unlikely hero, attractive super- spy, angry manager, geeky friend, etc. We've seen them all before. Nothing new here. The jokes in the movie can be funny, but often aren't. Once again, we've heard many of these jokes before in the exact same kinds of movies. The unfunny ones just ended up feeling pointless, which took away from the movie a little bit. I felt like the idea of the movie was supposed to be a joke too, but it took itself too seriously most of the time so I really didn't know what to think. Some jokes were poorly timed too, or just not good for the set mood. Despite all this, I still found myself laughing throughout the movie, sometimes pretty stinking hard. Overall Spy is just an alright movie. It tries to be both serious and funny at the same time, and while that can work, it doesn't work here. It also lacks in plot originality, predictability, and cliché, underdeveloped characters. While some parts are quite good, it ended up still being a very unoriginal movie. In the end I'd only recommend this movie if your looking just to sit down and mindlessly watch something. Don't expect anything great.",Spy

It also manages to come across as progressive and unique without trying to shove an underlying feminist ideology in your face - a rarity for a simple action-comedy trying to make a statement.And, thankfully, it looks like Hollywood is gradually figuring out what to do with Melissa McCarthy. She shines in this clever star vehicle, showcasing her prodigious, copious funny talents. It's a refreshing return to form for McCarthy, and also features a hilarious supporting turn from Jason Statham. A rib-tickling espionage spoof that gives a confident female-centered spin to the traditionally ultra-masculine spy/action-comedy genre - ""Spy"" offers further proof that Melissa McCarthy and writer-director Paul Feig bring out the best in one another.",Spy
112,bgar-80932,Better than expected,7,10 June 2018,This came out around the Melissa McCarthy rage and it honestly looked terrible so I never had any interest in seeing it. It's not a great movie but it did surprise me. The plot was decent enough with a couple plot twists but it was mainly about her free styling. Sometimes it was really funny and sometimes she just kept going too long which is basically what always happens with her. I enjoyed the first half of the movie a lot but then she became more confident in the movie and thus her insults became more ridiculous. I thought she was much more funny when she wasn't confident but either way it was a decent use of my time. Much better than I thought it would be.,Spy

114,osj2507,Well oiled comedy machine,7,17 July 2015,"This was a good film in general, with a good cast that is in some ways out of their right element, it is really fun and entertaining and there is a lot to love about this film in my honest opinion.It is really the cast that makes this film stick and be really great and funny, Melissa McCarthy is in an all time high, maybe a bit typical funny role, but her character is out of her usual elements in many ways, she is the silent awkward type and it is really good. Jude Law is the dashing British spy that really has it all, but is flawed in the way that he gets a bit too much of himself and doesn't know what is really going on around him. Jason Statham is in many ways the same, he is a spy but a more dumb one, hard hitting, shooting and moving on in a fast pace is his style, but he is not that clever and way to hard headed. These three spies really compliment each other in this film and have a lot of help from different sides, but it is fun seeing them in and out of their typical elements.The film is entertaining, very classic in its spy class in many ways, but does have the humor and strange extra scenes here and there to keep the viewer alert and see what is really going on. In this Melissas role of Susan Cooper is just great, she saves countless mishaps and strange behaviors not appropriate for a real spy :) There is a lot to see in this and it really is just a well oiled comedy machine, both in scenes, characters, events, fights, shootouts and much more.",Spy
115,MattBrady099,It's a enjoyable comedy,6,24 May 2015,"Well that was surprisingly funny and not terrible as I thought it was going to be.The story is about a CIA analyst who just so happens to be responsible for the success of some of the most dangerous missions. But when her partner suddenly disappears and another top agent is compromised, she finds herself going from behind the desk to into the field - deep undercover to infiltrate the inner circle of an arms dealer and prevent a global catastrophe.Spoof movies on spy films isn't anything new, we seen some good and we also seen some really bad ones that are not written very well and the jokes are just flat and retarded. Spy starring Melissa McCarthy looked the same and I didn't really care about until the film got it's early reviews from critics and it got positive reviews. So I just seen the movie last night and I thought the film Spy is a very funny comedy and it's ten times better than Tammy that we got last year.Melissa McCarthy can be a hit or miss with me, because I know she can do a great performance in comedy movies I mean she got nominated for Oscar in Bridesmaids so that's saying something. In this movie I thought she was going to be a clumsy over weight women who always slip up and makes things worse, you know the clichés in those comedy's, but I was extremely surprised that this didn't happen in this movie as Meliassa McCarthy character has a comedic ark to her but she also played a different character and not the ones that she normally pick. Melissa McCarthy did a good comedic performance in this movie and she did better in this movie then in Tammy.The director of the Paul Feig who previous did Bridesmaids, The Heat and he's doing the upcoming Ghostbusters movie. He directed the movie pretty good and although out the film I keep thinking of The Heat that he did and I'm saying that in a positive way as it shows he can mix action with comedy very well. Great work Paul Feig.The rest of the cast in the movie like: Jude Law, Rose Byrne and Jason Statham all three did great in the movie as both got they own funny lines and at least they wasn't wasted like in some other movies seem to do with a big cast like this, but luckily it worked out fine.The writing was good, the one liners in the movie has to be funniest one liners I've heard since the movie Whiplash and some of jokes really worked.Now for the problems: Some of the jokes in the movie are sometimes predictable and just fell flat to me. I know this may sound like a small little nick pick to most people but the movie has a Jame Bond like opening just like Bond films always open but of cause this movie does it's own take on it and it really wasn't all that good, as I said before it's a small little nick pick but it could have been a lot better, I'm just saying.Overall Spy is decent comedy and it's way better then some spoof movies on spy films. The acting was good, some of the jokes worked, Paul Feig directed the movie with style by mixing the action and comedy and the movie is enjoyable to watch.",Spy
116,ArchonCinemaReviews,And McCarthy is back in the game!!!!,7,11 June 2015,"Thank god! Finally, a funny comedy released in 2015.Spy is the perfect middle ground of the crazy antics we expect from Melissa McCarthy thanks to Bridesmaids but in a completely toned down and palatable kind of way.A homely desk bound techy named Susan Cooper (Melissa McCarthy) is the eyes, ears and brains for CIA special agent Bradley Fine (Jude Law), whom she also happens to be smitten with. When the identities of operatives are compromised and a nuke is on the market about to bought by a dangerous bidder, Cooper is taken from the desk and put on the field.In reality, the success of Spy must be attributed to its writer, director and brain behind the film, Paul Feig. And to the brains behind the casting of this film, who could not be more perfect for the roles they play.The tone of Spy is quite unique. Not quite satire as much as zany happenings thrown into a caper plot, it is the perfect blend of parodied humor rooted in a clear knowledge of the espionage genre. The jokes are unexpected and vibrant, utilizing the physical humor of McCarthy and the unexpected comedy of its other stars: Jason Statham, Rose Byrne and Jude Law.Feig must have a magic talent at direction because at no point does Spy feel to be too much, a common complaint we have for recent comedies released for the mass public. Gross-out jokes and overly long punch lines are in scarce supply, instead Spy is fast and banter oriented.We had incredibly low expectations for the film and long jumped off the Melissa McCarthy bandwagon. Which is why we can't stress our pleasant surprise enough. Perhaps the secret is the hilarious Miranda Hart, who should become her full time counterpart in all future films.Please check our website for full reviews of all the recent releases.",Spy
117,lathe-of-heaven,"I was honestly very surprised. Shockingly bad dialog. VERY poorly (or hastily) written. Like many others have said before me, truly AWFUL...",3,30 September 2015,"Wow... 7.2...??? Seriously? Well, in my lowly and wretched opinion it is enough to make me completely lose faith in the ratings here at IMDb. Honestly... and I'm swearing by everything Holy, believe me... I haven't seen such mindlessly idiotic dialog since I tried to watch 'THE CALL' with Halle Berry. Now I am talking mainstream, 'Big' films here. Movies with BIG stars and a fair amount of money behind them. And, up to THAT film, I had figured that that was just about THE worst, most horribly written mainstream film that I had ATTEMPTED to watch up to that time. Well... I'm sorry to say people, but we have a new 'Winner'...HOW is it even bloody POSSIBLE for this film to have even the 'Good' reviews that is has? I always check the External reviews when I'm considering spending time to watch a film, and I'll be Damned if I didn't read a few good sounding reviews, I think even at Blu-ray.com, who is usually VERY dependable for reviews. Well, NOT this time, let me tell you...Okay, I WILL admit that the opening credits were pretty damn sharp (minus the ear-bleeding song of course, GEEZ...) and the 'Action' stuff at the beginning was great! BUT... imagine my total amazement when people started opening their mouths and actually SAYING something... I say again, 'WOW!'... The back and forth between McCarthy and Jude Law was just about THE absolute worst dialog that I would EVER expect in a 'Big' film like this. How the HELL does THAT happen? I mean, really!?? I SUPPOSE that it was meant to be funny. And, ANY dialog... even when they were meeting together to decide what to do. And, if it is even CONCEIVABLE ('Inconceivable!' {'PRINCESS BRIDE':}) for it to get any worse, the dialog between McCarthy and her friend at work was UNSPEAKABLY and UTTERLY awful. I'm being honest here people. I cannot possibly convey to you how shockingly bad it was.Whew... after reading some clearly misleading reviews and after trying to stomach the first 45 minutes of this 'film', I felt that it was my Sacred duty to my fellow man (and woman, and I suppose Transgenders...) to come here and write what I truly felt about this movie.And you know, it is really a damn shame too... because I DID think that the IDEA and premise were quite brilliant, really. BUT, the only thing that I can think of, and the ONLY thing that comes to mind as to HOW the hell this could even have been SO horribly bad, is that maybe the idea was green lighted so quickly and the Powers That Be wanted it out and released SO damn fast, that it was literally impossible to have enough time to write it properly. So, what it appears like is a GREAT idea that was frigg'n RUSHED to the screen. That is truly the ONLY thing that I can think of how this could have happened. You can see too from just the 3 or 4 reviews immediately before mine (chronologically) how some people felt. They were all '1' star ratings. Yes..., ONE star. And their comments are scathingly bad.I guess when it comes to what the studios expect to be a 'Blockbuster', all I can figure is that they must have literally THOUSANDS of minions coming here and writing false reviews. I mean, when I saw the 7.2, I literally laughed my @ss off (that's why I'm having to stand right now...)So FWIW, I feel that I added at least MY honest impression of the film. I am just so blown away, because so far this is truly THE most extreme and egregious example that I've seen here on IMDb of a rating absolutely and categorically NOT fitting the 'quality' of the film at all...I'm giving it a '3' ONLY because the initial Bond style stuff and the opening credits were pretty Bitch'n. But, TRUST ME... that was it...",Spy

119,stevenrotherforth,Bring on a sequel as long as we get more bumbling Statham!,8,16 March 2019,"SpyA pleasant surprise was sitting down to this movie.
The premise is a tried and tested one. We've all seen the spy comedy before.
So what sets this one apart from the rest?
Well because this one is actually quite funny!
Sure this is mainly down to the seasoned comedy skills of lead Melissa McCarthy and Miranda Hart but suprisngly it is action star Jason Statham that steals the show.
Statham only crops up every now and again but when he does he owns every scene he's in.The plot like aforementioned is one that's been done before.
Expert Spies have to rely on underdog to save the day as their identities have been breached and there's the generic big bomb that needs to be retrieved so it's up to unknown and untested CIA analyst (McCarthy) to go undercover.Paul Feig's film manages to sustain the laughs and this is partially due to his excellent cast all getting fully onboard with the hilarity and having a good time making this crowd pleasing comedy.
The hero is only as good as their villain and Rose Byrne is both beautiful and hilarious to behold.
Her rapport with McCarthy helps drive the movie but when the film does begin to stall, up pops Statham sending the film back into overdrive.
There's good support from Jude Law who would have probably made a very good James Bond.
Perhaps he could fill Daniel Craig's shoes when he's done with the role?Action and wit is a plenty here and the cameo from the normally wooden 50 cent is another highlight to this bright and bushy comedy romp.
I wasn't a fan of Paul Feig's Ghostbusters reboot which also starred Melissa McCarthy but I'd definitely pay to see Spy 2!",Spy
120,diac228,"We Have Seen Peak McCarthy, And It Is Quite a Thrill",8,3 July 2015,"Similar to us seeing peak Jim Carrey in Dumb and Dumber or seeing peak Will Ferrell in Anchorman, we have seen peak Melissa McCarthy and it is glorious. Spy is a cluttered, ridiculous spoof action comedy that doesn't quite set a consistent tone but gives McCarthy the role of a lifetime, and in return we get the performance of a lifetime. Even though you never quite know if you should ever take any part of Spy seriously, the movie entertains, thrills, and has a shocking amount of gruesome action to coincide with the plethora of jokes flying left and right throughout the two hours.Under the helm of Paul Feig (which has McCarthy as his muse ala Woody Allen with Diane Keaton) providing the writing and directing, Spy is a wildly violent and relentless sendup on action movies of all types, from spy movies to the physics-ignorant Statham flicks that we've seen in the past decade. What starts off as a where-is-the-bomb plot dwells deeper with twists and turns and has the mild-manned Susan Cooper (usually working behind a desk) traveling to Europe to complete the mission.The cast is what ultimately delivers and carries this movie past any potential setbacks. Melissa McCarthy is phenomenal as her blend of sarcasm, physical comedy, and biting insults with perfect timing works perfectly here. Unlike most of her previous work, she was not just the overweight woman in an unlikely situation, there is much more to her personality in Spy that makes her much more likable, and much easier for us to root for her. We see much more of her when compared to Bridesmaids and The Heat and it gives her a chance to truly stand out and shine---and she does not disappoint.But kudos to everyone else, especially Rose Byrne as one of the antagonists and Jason Statham as a spoof of himself. A good comedy relies more on chemistry and talent level on screen above the script, despite that breaking most screen writing rules in the spectrum. Spy has the Caddyshack syndrome; whenever the storyline starts to drag at the slightest (the movie does get unnecessarily complex) you have the cast keep you engaged and entertained.What sets Spy apart from the spoofs is the surprising amount of action. We are treated to car chases, brutal fights, shootouts, and even a big final rousing sequence---albeit having an unexpected ending. What also allows Spy to stand out is the abundance of strong powerful women; from Susan Cooper herself to her co-workers, her boss, and even her adversary. It is a welcoming change and a drift from the norm in this genre of film---even though Mad Max Fury Road may have stolen some of its feminist thunder.This is Paul Feig's best work, McCarthy's best performance, and one of the best movies of the year. Funnier than you'd expect, more action-packed than you would anticipate, and then throw in Jason Statham tossing some of the most astonishingly hilarious work out of any non-comedic actor I've ever seen. This film is a hoot plain and simple, and should finally allow us to take McCarthy much more seriously.",Spy
121,dcarsonhagy,James Bond Out of Control!,9,10 June 2015,"Believe me, ""Spy"" will be one of the most entertaining times you'll have at the movies this (or any) year.

The music is great and keeps in touch with the tone the movie attempts to set. All the cast do fantastic jobs acting wise and you seriously believe their character. Melissa McCarthy's rants are hysterically funny as is her unbelievable 'spy mode'! The cinematography is great and works very well. It is a well directed, edited, composed and acted movie. The actual action scenes ​were very well choreographed to feel bad ass. Jason Statham is a personal favourite character and his insane, egotistical attitude contrasts to Melissa's pre-spy mode. Miranda Hart and Jude Law do good with there performances though Jude feels like more of a plot device. Peter Serafinowicz did a good job of acting within acting; his mini-twist at the end was surprising and also funny.Bad: The villains were not that interesting or unique or even special. They just shifted the story along. Jude Law was just a plot device over an actual character. The twist at the end felt forced and just wasn't that interesting. The slow motion action parts were just annoying and took away from the pace. A much more fast paced action with little breaks would fit better.Best Part: Any Melissa McCarty rantMVP: Jason Statham as Ford.8/10",Spy
123,rooee,Bond girl,4,11 June 2015,"Well, here's a disappointment. After reminding us that half the world's population was being ignored in mainstream American comedy with Bridesmaids, and reminding us of the comedy timing of Sandra Bullock in The Heat, Paul Feig's third collaboration with Melissa McCarthy is a bit of a dud. Not terrible, but no better than something like, say, last year's Let's Be Cops.The trailer would have us think this is a contrived fish-out-of-water farce in which McCarthy's character, Susan Cooper, is woefully out of her depth and bumbles through her mission to stop a nuke falling into the wrong hands. It is contrived, but the whole truth is more refreshing – she is actually a very capable spy who's been unwittingly prevented from progressing by her James Bond-alike partner, Bradley Fine (Jude Law). All Susan lacks is confidence, and she finds it when staring down the barrel of conniving Rayna Boyanov's (Rose Byrne) gun – even if this confidence is, essentially, a re-run of her sweary cop from The Heat.The Euro-hopping plot is okay, with some fun twists, and Feig has no issues getting decent performances out of his very fine cast. The problem – and it's a crippling problem – is the script, which relies too heavily on f-bombs and unfunny similes, and includes too many dead-end setups without a punchline. It indulges the worst impulses of modern American comedy movies: scripted situations but few actual scripted jokes (or so it would appear – if they are scripted then gawd 'elp us).The cast do their best to elevate this rawest of material. McCarthy, who really deserves better by now, is reliable as always. But the revelation is Jason Statham, playing himself up as the stupidest agent in the CIA – he's the kid in the playground (or indeed the adult at the dinner party) who always has to one-up someone else's story. He's utterly superfluous to the plot, but it appears that what may have once been a pointless cameo has been elevated due to the deficiencies around him. Meanwhile, Peter Serafinowicz has a riot as Italian stereotype Aldo, and he gets the best final punchline of anyone.Sadly, the central pairing of Melissa McCarthy and Miranda Hart never comes alive; they never come across as real buddies. Hart's deadpan delivery is unsuited to the madcap nature of the action around her. There are flashes of what Feig is trying to get at – a kind of French and Saunders vs. James Bond vibe – but the dialogue is too brash and the slapstick too broad to match the elder duo's best sketches.How about the omens for the upcoming Ghostbusters reboot? Well, the action is reasonably well choreographed, the timing usually lands, and the necessity for a PG rating should ensure that resorting to dull crassness is not an option. But Feig's ability as a screenwriter is evidently questionable (his last writing credit was the doomed I Am David in 2003). We live in hope – but a little less hope now.",Spy
124,James_De_Bello,8/10,8,15 July 2015,"One of the best comedies to be released in the last years, a leap forward for Melissa McCarthy's comedy, a major show for Paul Feig, a win for every single person involved.If this movie can't be faulted for something that thing is being low on laughs. In some way the filmmakers find a way to make every single scene in the film culminate in at least one laugh. That definitely speaks to the brilliance with which Feig directs the film. There are only two brief moments in the movie where I was taken slightly out, for the rest there aren't dull moments. He doesn't resort to cheap or dull filmaking and injects every frame of the film with something to be absorbed and with vibrant energy. Be it slapstick or dialogue comedy this film has iconic moments in both and really teaches a lesson in how to do comedy right. There are multiple jokes that I couldn't catch because I was laughing from the last one. This film is also very, very smart and treats its audience with respect delivering many jokes that take brains to get, yet still have the same effect of the others. Statham's character is comedy gold and Statham himself plays him to perfection with some of the best comedic timing I've seen, really without exaggerating there was something about him that cracked me up every time he opened his mouth and his running gag is definitely the best one. Rose Byrne is as always magnetic on screen and further proves her comedic chops. Melissa McCarthy doesn't resort to the same old jokes she stared with and continuously surprises with perfect timing. Jude Law as always impeccable.There are only a couple of things that stop Spy from being one of the great recent comedies and join the club of something like ""21 Jump Street"". Firstly and most importantly, with the exception of Jason Statham, the characters are more staples than funny but interesting characters to hang out with. Yes there are a couple of side ones that have a fun beat, but for the majority it has a hard time defining its characters and I believe that is vital for a comedy, especially for the rewatch value. Moreover there are jokes dispersed around the film that kind of fall flat, there aren't many but still they do come sometimes and make for a brief 2-3 minutes of dizzy watch before getting back on board. Finally a couple of don't running gags simply don't work and don't have any kind of brilliance for them to fit into what is for the rest comedic gold.I strongly recommend not to miss this one in any way, it is both a blast to watch and a tour de force on how to make comedy right.",Spy

You know what you are in for when you have hilarious lines like that. Spy simply breathes on McCarthy's excellent comic timing, Peter Serafinowicz's horniness (boy that doesn't stop at all), Statham's goofiness (he can do anything!), Byrne's snobby demenaour and Jude Law's pizazz. Oooh oooh and there is obnoxious gore too! Spy is a fun ride if you wish to have some good laughs into a clichéd backdrop. You have often played serious things goofy in your heads. When your spoof mode is on and you make fun of everything dramatic. Spy does that! Period.The plot is well put, but is hard to concentrate on when you put Melissa in the vanguard. She is a fluffy bag of awesomeness that just doesn't stop tickling you. Complements her superbly is Miranda Hart who is brilliant as her bestie and boy she's funny! Like every other comedy, there are unforeseen cuts, unserious frames that lose gravity as soon as things start to become serious. The climax dies out pretty soon too. There is nothing that really thrills you. But the movie's a hoot! Who's complaining? Go watch it!",Spy
126,jamiedarlow-37510,A very welcome contribution to the spy spoof genre!,7,8 February 2020,The best film Melissa McCarthy and Paul Feig have done together since Bridesmaids; laughed out loud in a few places and it is clearly made with a passion for the spy genre! Particular highlights for me were a couple of scenes with Jason Statham on great comic form and Peter Serafinowitz turning up as a real-life version of Pepe le Pew! McCarthy is a brilliant dramatic actor as well as comic and has great on-screen chemistry with everybody (including Miranda Hart who is a pleasure to watch in her first major big screen role),Spy
127,shawneofthedead,Nothing undercover about this film - it's an outright hit.,8,21 May 2015,"From Bond to Bourne, by way of The Naked Gun and Johnny English, movies about covert operatives kicking butt and saving the day - not always intentionally - have become a genre unto themselves. That's why the advent of Paul Feig's Spy is faintly depressing: how is a female-led comedy spoofing the secret world of spies only happening now, in 2015? At least there's nothing at all depressing about the film itself: Spy is a blast of fun, cheeky adrenaline which cleverly sends up the dude-centric conventions of the genre while crafting a world and characters that both embrace and defy stereotypes.Susan Cooper (McCarthy) wanted a life of adventure and mystery when she joined the CIA. However, despite turning in an outstanding performance at the training academy, she's faded almost literally into the background. In the perennially vermin-infested confines of CIA HQ, she commiserates with fellow desk jockey Nancy (Hart) while providing able support for the agency's top operative: cocky, suave Bradley Fine (Law). But, when Fine runs afoul of ruthless arms dealer Raina Boyanov (Byrne), Susan finds herself in a unique position to take action - she's the only fully-trained agent who is also a complete unknown in the field.Many spy spoofs falter in balancing comedy with plot and action - a problem that Spy largely manages to avoid until its almost breathlessly overstuffed ending. Feig's script is sharp and witty, poking fun at character and convention while never losing sight of the power of a good pratfall. Considering how many gags and jokes he packs into each frame of the film, it's a marvel that so many land as well as they do. But land they do, from the almost outrageously frumpy cover identities Susan is stuck with, to the frankly ridiculous rogue antics of Rick Ford (Statham), an unpredictable, hot-headed agent who resigns in a rage-fuelled fit of machismo when Susan is tasked to pick up where Fine left off.Beyond the comedy, however, what keeps the film chugging along is the fact that Feig also cannily supplies Susan with plenty of credible obstacles derived from plot and character. There's the nominal villain, of course: petulant, haughty Raina, who orchestrates death and destruction without blinking an eye. But the plot extends beyond Raina and her histrionics. Susan has quite a few lovely character moments too. Not only does she turn her invisibility to her advantage when she first observes then infiltrates Raina's operation, Susan also demonstrates to everyone, herself included, that she really is every bit as competent - if not more so - than her male counterparts.Feig even throws in some action sequences worthy - and deliberately reminiscent - of a top-grade spy flick, from an escape on a motorboat under heavy fire, through to a spectacular mid-air confrontation between the forces of good and evil. The fight scenes are brutally well-choreographed, with Susan giving every bit as good as she gets as she efficiently takes down everyone in her path. That said, Spy does stumble a little as it barrels towards its gigantic final set-piece, the action beats building up in a way that suggest Feig is trying to write himself out of a tough spot.But Feig never loses sight of his main character, who proves to be the finest gift he's yet given to his muse (yes, that includes the Oscar nomination she picked up for her role in Bridesmaids and her enduring friendship with Sandra Bullock, her co-star in The Heat). Susan is a role that sits comfortably in McCarthy's wheelhouse, allowing her to deploy her irrepressible charm and impeccable comic timing, while also suggesting a wealth of emotion and depth beneath a relentlessly sunny exterior. But it's also a role that allows audiences to look beyond the brash, loud characters she's become known for in her film career - one that celebrates McCarthy as a comedian, an actress and a person. The fact that the film never once doubts Susan's abilities in the field is one of the most empowering statements you'll see in a film this year.Though she's more than capable of doing so, McCarthy doesn't have to carry the entire film by herself. Feig has provided her with a stellar supporting cast - including Allison Janney as Susan's humourless boss and Peter Serafinowicz as an Italian contact with a healthy appreciation of Susan's wiles. Law turns in a sparklingly self-deprecating performance as the film's version of Bond, while Hart bumbles her way endearingly through proceedings in much the same way she does on her eponymous hit British sitcom.But the real standouts in the supporting cast are Byrne and Statham, both tasked with playing loud, outlandish characters who are just barely more than caricatures. Byrne is delightfully silly as a spoilt daughter who has inherited a highly lucrative nuclear device, sneaking quite a bit of charm into the menace that accompanies Raina's more callous decisions. Statham, meanwhile, flings his grim, taciturn demeanour - cultivated and recycled in a string of cookie-cutter action thrillers - out the window. He plays loose cannon Ford with a joyful pomposity that's joyous to watch.At a time when the sexism that still riddles Hollywood is being actively discussed and dissected (courtesy of films like Mad Max: Fury Road and Avengers: Age Of Ultron), Spy delivers the goods as a feminist twist on a genre that has been dominated by men for far too long. Its female characters are a magnificent blend of strong and silly, tough and tender all at once - incontrovertible proof, not that it should be needed in the first place, that women are funny and can headline genres typically associated with the male of the species. But, most importantly of all, Spy is delightful in and of itself. Politics aside, this is, quite simply, a top-notch spy comedy, jammed full of big laughs and bigger action - which is reason enough for it to be a big hit.",Spy
128,jackmeat,A very enjoyable and funny action flick,7,26 September 2015,"My quick rating 7,3/10. A very impressive movie to say the least. Melissa McCarthy again is hilarious and does so by juggling the part of a midwest everyday women and immediately changes on the fly into raunchy one-liners so well. The ease which she shows on screen is wonderful and so fresh in seeing what she calls ""big women"" movies as not being some stupid vehicle or drawback, just another performance. ALong the way in good performances is Jason Statham completely making fun of his own character/real life persona he is typecast into. It is obvious to tell he enjoyed poking fun at himself. Just the beginning of course since the story itself was a nice throwback to the spy genre movies with double crosses and who is on whose side twists. Not saying any were all that surprising but still added to the entertainment value. The action scenes are nicely edited together and make sure to be just unbelievable enough to also illicit a laugh from them. Overall along with sprawling scenes around the globe and production values being top notch, it is hard to find flaws in such a surprisingly good flick so leave it at, ""Check this one out"" , you will not be sorry.",Spy
129,Figgy66-915-598470,Laughed from start to finish,10,10 June 2015,"10 June 2015 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Spy. Melissa McCarthy, Jason Statham and Jude Law star in this James Bond homage. The format is pure 007 from the opening sequences leading into the opening credits which are an entertainment piece in themselves, leading into the film proper. That's where the similarity kind of skews off to the side. Don't expect to watch a classically written script with an award winning storyline, because that's not what you will get. This was simply the funniest film I have watched in a long long time. Ten years after joining the CIA Susan Cooper is a brilliant analyst, totally desk bound in a bat ridden cellar and completely in love with the agent she supports. When the opportunity arises she goes out into the field and completely rewrites the rule book for undercover agents. Also starring the wonderful Miranda Hart, this film entertained from start to finish, and the audience laughed out loud all the way through. If you are at all prudish about bad language please don't let it put you off, there is plenty but try and go with an open mind, I kind of think it was necessary for the plot. Go see this film, funny, funny, funny!!!",Spy
130,troyputland,Melissa McCarthy has found her calling.,9,13 June 2015,"Spy is a comedy for those who like to have a laugh and just be plain silly. Paul Feig's Bridesmaids was the start of something special. 2013's The Heat was a successful dive in to the overused buddy-cop genre. Spy is just as engaging as these, and carries just as many laughs. Melissa McCarthy has perfected her comedy satire (her character's far less irritable than those in Tammy and Identity Thief), in a role that fits her personality. McCarthy shows a combination of frailty and bravery as a desk jockey for the CIA. She's the eyes and ears of agent Bradley Fine (Jude Law). When all agents are compromised, Susan (McCarthy) enter the field. Placing her undercover reaps some of the best laughs of 2015 so far. McCarthy may be on fire, but it's another particular person who crashes in like a blaze of glory: Jason Statham. His super-spy gives it large, reeling off all the brave acts he's committed ('I watched the woman I love get tossed from a plane and hit by another plane mid-air. I drove a car off a freeway on top of a train while it was on fire. Not the car, I was on fire.'), when in actual fact he's a clumsy buffoon. He makes life very difficult for Susan, which, for us, is a treasure to watch. When he's off screen he's wanted back. When he's on stage we don't want him to leave. Miranda Hart, Rose Byrne and Jude Law also add flare in one way or another. Spy is huge fun and a barrel of laughs. Even with its cliché setups and stereotypical characters, Spy doesn't try to be anything other than entertaining, and for that it receives great credit.",Spy
131,ginocox-206-336968,"A brilliant, polished parody impaired by a clumsy, ham-fisted feminist theme",8,16 September 2015,"The numerous effective parts of ""Spy"" are brilliant. The cast is excellent, particularly Jason Stratham and Jude Law. Production values are superb, with a refreshing absence of Steadicam shots that aren't steady. Wardrobe, music, makeup, action choreography, editing, etc., are all excellent. Much of the film is hilarious. The action scenes are tense and exciting with a comic flair. The film has what seems intended to be a strong feminist female empowerment theme, but it is handled in such a heavy-handed manner that it detracts from the plot. McCarthy's Susan Cooper is a misandrist working in a community of misogynists. While Statham's Ford may seem sexist when he suggests she stay in a supporting role, he is also expressing legitimate concerns about her physical fitness and lack of experience. His reservations are specific to Cooper, not a universal aversion to any woman working in a traditionally male role. While he doesn't mince words, he is polite and respectful, and he offers numerous reasons why he believes he is better qualified than not only Cooper, but any other ordinary human. Cooper's sexist comments are crude and vulgar, saying such things as, ""I'm the person that's gonna cut your dick off and glue it to your forehead so you look like a limp-dick unicorn."" She is disdainful of all men and all attractive women. The film presents men as disposable playthings. Rayna quickly dispatches henchmen over minor failings with the dispassion of Dr Evil. The predominantly female support team are the true brains behind the testosterone driven field agents, not only alerting them to unseen dangers, but recommending tactics and providing their knowledge, judgment and wisdom. The operations manager is a capable, empowered woman who is subconsciously misogynistic herself and unwilling to empower other capable women she supervises. Miranda Hart's Nancy is basically the same character as Cooper, but tall and ungainly instead of short and corpulent. At the conclusion, many of the misogynists acknowledge Cooper's capabilities, but Cooper doesn't reject her sexist sentiments, presumably so the character can transition unchanged into a sequel.While ""Spy"" is an excellent film in many respects, it allows its political message to detract from the story without providing a compelling political statement. It's much more effective when presented subtly, as when Aldo appears in the denouement and suggests that appearances can be deceiving. While McCarthy is the protagonist, Statham and Law steal the show. Stratham is hilarious.",Spy
132,themadmovieman,Rapid-fire Bond parody with constant hilarity throughout,8,7 June 2015,"This film is so much fun! It's got a kick-ass central performance by Melissa McCarthy, complemented by great shows from an A-list cast, as well as fantastic action, a suspenseful if not generic plot and consistently hilarious laugh-out-loud comedy.This is by far one of the better James Bond parodies. Much like this year's Kingsman: The Secret Service, it satirises the genre perfectly, throwing in brilliant in-jokes and witty copies of classic Bond moments and tropes, making for a lot of laughs, whilst it also successfully adds brilliant action and a story that is massively exciting.The funniest thing about this film is that it is quite foul-mouthed and full of unpredictable humour from start to finish. It's a quick- paced comedy that throws so many jokes at you, you'll need to watch it again to have a chance of catching them all, because everything is simply so funny, and it even has a good shock value with such a high swear count and excessively comical (but often bloody) violence.Melissa McCarthy is absolutely stunning here. She plays her generic underdog character like in films such as The Heat and Identity Thief, but she adds a bit of shine to what was quickly becoming a tiresome character, showing off quite a slick image in some of the latter stages of the film to go against her stereotype, which not only fits perfectly into the film, but is a nice surprise to see what else she can do.The rest of the performances are fantastic too. Jude Law plays a kick-ass pseudo-007, Jason Statham brilliantly makes fun of himself in an over-the-top, sweary Statham role, whilst Rose Byrne is an incredibly suave and sexy villain, as well as being a lot of fun when it comes to the slapstick and sillier side to the plot.That plot is, on the whole, thrillingly entertaining. Of course, you know what's going to happen, it's the most generic spy plot in the world, but the globetrotting, the slick gadgets, the countless criminals all make it into a rapid-fire thrill ride that's just as enjoyable as any Bond or Mission: Impossible movie.Finally, the action here is also incredible to watch. Melissa McCarthy does a great job of getting stuck into some very action- packed sequences, again deriving from her stereotypical on screen persona, whilst the visual effects, explosions and fight sequences throughout are both brilliant to witness as well as hilarious to watch.Overall, I'm giving this an 8, because it's a thrilling, action- packed and hilarious spy parody that keeps up high quality comedy throughout that will leave you in tears of laughter by the end.",Spy
133,luke-a-mcgowan,"If this is Paul Feig's sneaky audition to the world that he's ready and willing to take on action films, then lets embrace it!",8,18 June 2015,"On face value (and indeed from the trailer) I had no reason to be excited about Spy. I am familiar with Melissa McCarthey's reputation for these fat-comedies even if I've escaped most of them, and the trailer (which evoked one laugh on first viewing, and about 4 cringes on subsequent viewing) didn't do much for me either. Sadly, for the first twenty minutes, I was proved right. The writing is terrible, too much time is dedicated to pink eye jokes and the fact that McCarthey is in love with Jude Law's character. There's good comedic timing, but its a rather unpleasant experience to sit through.AND THEN. At around the 20-25 minute mark, at a point marked by Jason Statham's first appearance in the movie, the film takes a sharp right turn and becomes so wildly hilarious that its like Paul Feig shook off the half-doze he was writing the first part of the film with and starts churning out gold. Spy is absolutely hilarious, but works even better as an action film. If this is Paul Feig's sneaky audition to the world that he's ready and willing to take on action films, then lets embrace it! He knows how to construct a scene all right. The stunt choreography is so flawless its like watching a fast paced combat dance. He can capture the fights without resorting to crummy shaky cam, and the film is packed full of epic fight scenes. I will put money right now that the MTV Award for Best Fight will have the kitchen fight between McCarthey and an female assassin in its top 2. Melissa McCarthey takes a while to get good stuff to work with in this film - her comedic timing is great, but she's not given much to work with. But when she goes undercover, she starts ripping out pearlers and not holding back. She channels R. Lee Ermey from Full Metal Jacket in the insult department, and listening to her trade barbs with Statham and Byrne is a treat for the ears and probably dangerous for the gut.Jason Statham is easily the best part of this movie. He is SO. GODDAMN. FUNNY. His comedic timing as the egotistical but inept spy Rick Ford is brilliant. He could have easily been a caricature of more famous inept spies like Maxwell Smart, but Statham's serious intensity is such a perfect juxtaposition to his incompetency that its a wholly original and hilarious creation. His rambling monologues about all the impossible missions he's pulled off are so funny that you're likely not going to remember more than two or three examples because you were laughing so hard during the rest of it. Even his little quips to himself or McCarthey are brilliant - ""I f*cking made it, didn't I?"" he responds to a question about where he got a suit from. His final line in the film was so perfect that my entire cinema exploded (not a bad effort considering how few were in there). I could rave all day about Statham. In the supporting cast, Miranda Hart grated on me for about half of the film and then ended up being a hilarious asset to the third act. Peter Serafinowicz was a scene stealer in so many ways (his final scene boggled my mind). Rose Byrne is suitably diabolical and sexy, and while I have nothing to complain about, Bobby Canavale and Allison Janney could have been better used in bigger parts.The plot takes a big left turn when Cooper blows her cover on Rayna's private jet and then has to bluff her way into a cover story. I was thoroughly impressed with how well that was handled. I was actually convinced by McCarthey's cover story, which is impressive considering that I'd just spent an hour watching a complete contradiction of that story! Where the film became too clever was the placement of Jude Law and Morena Baccarin's characters within the crime dynamic. I felt that Baccarin was wasted, and they could have cut her and given her role to Law to avoid all the circles within circles. That's not to say it didn't pay off, I'd have just preferred a simpler conclusion.Forget Kingsman, forget Mad Max Fury Road, forget the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe. THIS is the film I want a sequel to. More Statham, more McCarthey, more Spy. It wasn't perfect, but I want more.",Spy

There are some great comic lines throughout but what you might also notice is that there is quite a bit of truth in some of the sometime preposterous set ups. ""Coop"", of course, is a super competent agent but she is relegated to the dark fetid basement tied to her computer whilst agent Fine lives the high life whilst knocking out the occasional crook. It seems even when women have women bosses they are never seen for the potential they truly have. ""Coop"" more than pays back the smidgeon of trust she is eventually allowed. Nancy (Hart) reprises her bumbling incompetent comedy act but is really just hiding her competence. Fab ""was he or wasn't he"" moment near the end. Ha ha ha.

135,nicolechan916,"Great script, acting and action.",9,13 June 2015,"This film is absolutely hilarious. It invoked so many laughs and some so strong that I actually teared a few times. Definitely a must watch if you loved The Heat or Kingsman (which I didn't like). In my opinion since I loved The Heat, this film is on par or even better than that, which comes as no surprise seeing as Paul Feig directed both of them and they both star McCarthy.The acting is absolutely amazing, and what makes the movie even better are their straight faces during hysterical scenes. Law and Hart give an OK performance as their characters are more secondary. However McCarty, Statham and Byrne give an absolutely amazing performance that liven up the atmosphere to a whole other level. The lines they spit out – though have too many F-bombs, manage to erupt the entire theatre with laughs.Props to Paul Feig for both writing and directing this masterpiece of a comedy. The jokes are not so troll-like to be eye roll worthy and are not so bland or repetitive to make it stale. This was well directed and edited too, with the beginning credits looking like something out of a Bond film.Plus, the action scenes were really well done, especially for a comedy. I wasn't expecting the film to have such great fighting scenes, and it was definitely a plus that there was no overexposure of blood and gore.In conclusion, apart from the many F-bombs, this is a must see comedy that will leave you laughing till you cry.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",Spy
136,trublu215,A funny and thoroughly entertaining comedy with a phenomenal cast.,8,6 June 2015,"Spy marks Paul Feig at his most talented and McCarthy as, well, McCarthy. As always, the result is funny and downright hilarious at times. Featuring a grade A cast with Jude Law, Jason Statham, Rose Byrne and, of course, Melissa McCarthy, Spy is as entertaining as a summer action comedy can get. McCarthy stars as Cooper, a CIA agent that spends most of her time behind a computer being the strategic eyes and ears for CIA Field Operative Fine, played by Jude Law. When a set of tragic circumstances occur, Cooper is thrown into the field to apprehend a criminal mastermind who is in possession of a nuke. As you can probably tell from the trailers, she's wildly under qualified for the job. What makes Spy different from The Heat and Identity Theft is that Spy carries heart and merit that is purely thankful to Paul Feig's awesome script filled with satirical jabs at the government along with classic spy movie spoofs, it makes for a really entertaining flick. The comedic genius, however, does not come from the film's lead. It comes from a surprising source...Jason Statham playing an exaggerated super agent who is more brawn than he is brain and doubts Cooper the whole way. Statham is absolutely brilliant in this film. He is on point in every scene and plays the role perfectly and has the physicality to make it work. He can kick ass and still manage to make you crack up especially with an ending scene that is bound to have people rolling in the theater. While I do think Spy was McCarthy's best performance since Bridesmaids, I still do take issue with the scenes of constant and vulgar strings of profanity. The beginning of this film features our lead sweet and kind and very subtle in the way she delivered the comedy...then by the middle of the film, she is back to the McCarthy we've seen time and time again. While it still does manage to make you crack up in the moment, that is merely all it becomes. None of those scenes resonated with laughter, they were mere chuckles. Either way, McCarthy is still amazing in this film even if some of it feels like a rehash of the same performance from The Heat, Identity Theft, and Bridesmaids. The film as a whole is quite good but it starts to lose some steam around the 90 minute mark and starts to feel repetitive after awhile until the ending blasts out of nowhere and features a twist, a shootout and a cameo from 50 Cent. After awhile, it becomes pretty clear that there is a good fifteen minutes that could have been cut and trimmed but it still works. Overall, Spy is a funny, violent, action packed piece of entertainment that features Melissa McCarthy at her best since Bridesmaid and Jason Statham in one of his best performances ever.",Spy
137,ghost_dog86,Review from a Paul Feig hater,4,21 June 2015,"Before I stepped into the theater, it was impossible to avoid the accolades this film had been getting; some calling it the funniest movie of the year, so far. So, suffice to say, my expectations were high. Allow me to cut to the chase (something I'd wished ""Spy"" would've done""). For the first 45 minutes I didn't laugh at all. And it wasn't until the arrival of Rose Byrne (ONE HOUR INTO THE MOVIE!) that I felt ""Spy"" hit any kind of consistent comedic stride. And even then, when later sequences would lack the McCarthy v. Byrne argumentative visual, this Paul Feig comedy left much to be desired. Synopsis: Bradley Fine (Jude Law) is a charismatic CIA field agent and Susan (Melissa McCarthy) is in the friend zoneand also, technically a CIA agent, although relegated to the office. But when all of the field agent's names become public knowledge, Susan gets a chance to save the day by becoming an actual field agent. And then ""comedy"" ensues. ""Spy"" is a James Bond satire. From the spot on opening credits to the extremely well choreographed fight sequences, Feig has done his homework here, leaving no doubt that he could direct a 007 film if ever called upon. But those who proclaim this to be a comedic gem the caliber of an ""Austin Powers: International man of Mystery"", are very much fooling themselves. Problems arise rather quickly as the initial myriad of running gags fall flat; first and foremost, a reoccurring vermin infestation joke which didn't work the first or 50th time. After that, this movie's downfall can be more evenly distributed between an actress named Miranda Hart, who plays the annoying best friend/sidekick, and writer/director Paul Feig's comedic joke telling abilities; or lack thereof.Even though McCarthy has transformed into the female equivalent of Will Farrell (with her character remaining the same from film to film) she is not the problem here. The main problem seems to stem from a combination of bad joke writing and leaving her as the main focal point on screen for too long. Here's the thing: Just like Farrell, McCarthy works best as a sidekick or at the very least, paired in a duo. And thus, when Byrne comes on screen, she becomes that lifesaver which rescues this film from drowning a very quiet death. But if Feig already knew (having worked with McCarthy on ""The Heat"" AND ""Bridesmaids"") what we (the audience) already knew, why does it take so long for her to get any help? Why must we watch McCarthy flounder about in open water for a cringe-worthy amount of time? Final Thought: I may get some flak from people who claim I am some kind of Paul Feig hater, as this is his third film in a row which has received a lukewarm response from this reviewer. And though I do believe there is an audience for Feig's repetitive (watered down Judd Apatow) form of slapstick; it is now my belief that this filmmaker uses the women empowerment/strong female lead angle as a crutch to mask the fact that his movies are simply not that funny; in the same way Tyler Perry uses minorities as his leads and heavy Christian themes, in an attempt to mask the fact that his stories are exploitative trash. That said, ""Spy"" still contains comedic pockets which rise above the norm. It's just a shame that ""Spy"" is a perfect example of ""too little, too late.""",Spy

139,mattiasflgrtll6,Paul Feig - the next big comedy director?,9,7 July 2015,"What is better than a very well-written raunchy comedy? With The Heat and now this flick, Feig has made Melissa McCarthy the star in his movies and let her go absolutely ball nuts... which is a joy to watch! (I didn't think Bridesmaids was that good though) And the movie is PEPPERED with tons of witty lines, psychical crazy comedy and an amount of splatter as well! Her character (Susan Cooper) starts out as very sweet and innocuous at first, but later on becomes more violent and fouler in mouth. But what is so brilliant is that even then, she still manages to make the character admirable and some of the innocence is still there even then. Miranda Hart is also doing an equally terrific job as Nancy, Susan's friend, who I've got to say is just as adorable as McCarthy's character is. Just as much did I highly enjoy Rose Byrne as Rayna, who even in her nicest moments had an insult in charge for nearly every sentence.But as much as I love McCarthy in the movie... and I REALLY do... Jason Statham stole the show. The way he plays a parody of pretty much every tough character he has been and does it with such flavor too, is priceless. Yes, I see what other people mean when they point out how inconsistent his character is (at first ridiculously skilled, then the clumsiest and stupidest person ever), but he was so marvelously goddamn funny that I'm willing to overlook that!Oh and how did I forget? Peter Serafinowicz as Aldo... He was HILARIOUS!!! At first I thought he would only appear in one scene as some random wacky ladies' man Susan meets on the street, but when his role got bigger, I was pleasantly surprised. And best thing of all, his schtick gets even FUNNIER instead of too old!I can't remember the last time I laughed so much when seeing a movie at the cinema. I'm terrible at remembering quotes, and then I still actually recall a few from this movie!The direction itself was very creative too. The action scenes were intense and deliciously violent and some of the camera pans looked really cool. THIS is how you do action, unlike *cough*McG*cough*.But do you know what really surprised me? The writing was actually incredibly clever. I won't spoil anything, because this review is really just for people who haven't seen the movie. It's the kind of comedy where you NEED to hear all of the lines while watching the movie for maximum comic effect, and not have them spoiled before you do. That's just how funny it is. I will just say that some of the twists were ""Whut?"" enough that it made for an intriguing story. How often do you have a comedy with a great twist?Even so, this movie is not complete perfection. A couple gags were dragged out for too long (The Amber Valentine line was only funny one single time and only got less and less funnier for each time) and the inclusion of 50 Cent is (albeit amusing) shoe-horned as f'uck.But trust me, you can easily overlook those flaws! Recommend this movie to your family and friends, you'll truly have a blast!",Spy

141,pivic,Reminiscent of a failed stand-up performance: ups and downs,3,20 May 2015,"This film contains a lot of non-working jokes, and I'm referring to members of the cinema audience who were laughing at most jokes, that they didn't actually laugh at a lot of stuff that were obviously meant as jokes but fell flat.Having said that, there are a few laugh out loud moments in this film, for me, especially where I really didn't want to laugh, but couldn't help myself. I also liked a lot of the moments where I felt the laughs were for women, not _at_ women; have we reached a higher consciousness where feministic comedy is concerned? I'd like to think so.The forté of McCarthy is what makes this film work, along with parts of the script. The plot is ridiculous, as is most of the twists, but some of the jokes are really funny, even though most of the physical comedy sadly makes me remember Benny Hill, and yearn for Monty Python or South Park. This film doesn't exactly win at being a pastiche of the James Bond franchise, but it's better than being a parody.This film reminds me of a semi-failed stand-up performance, where you laugh because of some of the jokes, but not at most. You wait for the good ones to come, but it's a bad roller-coaster ride.",Spy
142,CleveMan66,"""Spy"" is an above-average comedy which makes good use of its stars, settings and set-up.",8,7 June 2015,"Watching Melissa McCarthy growing into the role of one of the best comedians working today has been both pleasurable and painful. After toiling away in minor film and television roles since the late 1990s, she finally broke through at the beginning of this decade with her hit TV sitcom ""Mike & Molly"" and her role in ""Bridesmaids"". Unfortunately, breaking through doesn't guarantee a steady stream of on-screen successes. McCarthy graduated to leading roles, but the movies ranged from profitable (if not critically acclaimed) to universally panned. Just look at the list of her 2013 and 2014 films: ""Identity Thief"", ""The Hangover Part III"", ""The Heat"", ""Tammy"" and ""St. Vincent"". That's only a two-year span, but includes five releases with big differences in profitability and in quality – both in the film and in her performances. That brings us to ""Spy"" (R, 2:00). With that film being her only live-action 2015 release – and then as many as four films (including the ""Ghostbusters"" reboot) coming out in 2016, McCarthy had a lot riding on ""Spy"".In this film, McCarthy plays Susan Cooper, a very talented, but put-upon CIA analyst. She works in the basement of CIA Headquarters, providing real-time intel to agents in the field – including one very special agent, Bradley Fine (Jude Law). Cooper would like to be more than the voice in Fine's earpiece but can't come right out and say it, and Fine readily acknowledges that he wouldn't be as successful without Cooper, but that's the extent of their relationship. When arms dealer Tihomir Boyanov (Raad Rawi) dies before Fine can find out where Boyanov has hidden a stolen nuke, and Fine is himself taken out by Boyanov's daughter, Rayna (Rose Byrne), who also reveals that she knows the names of all of the CIA's field agents, Cooper offers to go after Rayna – to complete Fine's mission, and maybe avenge him.Nothing's easy for Cooper in her new role. She's given new identities and clothing that ""the company"" thinks fits her persona, but it all results in an endless string of personal humiliations and jokes at the expense of our intrepid hero. In fact, it seems that almost no one thinks she's up to the challenge. She meets with skepticism from her boss, Deputy Director Elaine Crocker (Allison Janey), with disregard from field agent Karen Walker (Morena Baccarin) and with unmasked contempt by super-agent Rick Ford (Jason Statham). Ford opposes Cooper's enhanced status so strongly that he resigns in protest, goes rogue and insists on following Cooper on her mission.That mission is simply to keep track of Rayna and her most likely buyer, Sergio De Luca (Bobby Cannavale), to ""observe and report"". But when the CIA's plan goes awry, Cooper has to improvise. She dusts off the skills she gained in her initial training and proves that she can handle the field. Cooper's mission takes her from Washington D.C. to Paris to Rome and to Bulgaria. Through it all, she has the support and encouragement of fellow analyst Nancy Artingstall (Miranda Hart), but also has to endure the lecherous advances of overseas CIA contractor Aldo (Peter Serafinowicz) and the constant interference of Ford, who is hurting her efforts more than helping them. Of course, this being a spy movie, the story contains numerous surprises, twists and turns, and double-crosses. And, this being a spy movie of the comedy variety, hijinks and humor are plentiful and include various jokes, crudities, misunderstandings, sight gags and a lot of funny moments based in McCarthy's trademark self-deprecation.""Spy"" is an above-average comedy which makes good use of its stars, settings and set-up. Covert ops proves to be fertile ground for plot points, humor and, of course, some gorgeous scenery. The fish-out-of-water conceit works well in the hands of McCarthy, who seems to get funnier with every film. It's always great seeing serious dramatic actors like Law and Statham bring the funny by playing extreme or off-beat versions of the characters that made them famous. It's also fun to see actors who worked together in previous projects reunite – like McCarthy and Byrne (2011's ""Bridesmaids"") and real-life couple Byrne and Cannavale appearing together in a third film in less than a year (after autumn 2014's ""Annie"" and spring 2015's ""Adult Beginners""). Each member of the cast has great moments – including Britain's Serafinowicz, making the most of his biggest American film role to date. The story is somewhat predictable, but most of the jokes hit their mark and the humor is well-balanced in type and tone. Director Paul Feig, who has helmed two previous Melissa McCarthy movies (""Bridesmaids"" and ""The Heat"") also wrote this one. The result is a script with a good story and clever dialog, complimented by line delivery and physical comedy from a very talented cast, along with consistent and well-paced directing. ""A-""",Spy
143,blakiepeterson,A Contender for Best Comedy of 2015,9,4 July 2015,"Melissa McCarthy has been America's finest comedienne ever since she knocked us all out with her all-hands-on-deck supporting performance in 2011's Bridesmaids. Not a Lucy nor a Rosalind, McCarthy has always gone down and dirty, packing her yearly schedule with comedy parts built around her foul mouthed persona. But after a few too many misses, such as inexplicably high-grossing Identity Thief or critical disaster Tammy, one has begun to associate McCarthy with a wig and a greasy part, embodying a character better equipped for a Saturday Night Live skit than a full length movie. Finally, we have a vehicle worthy of her talents: Spy is the best comedy of the year. One shouldn't be saying such things until December, I know, but I doubt I'll find another romp as packed with belly laughs as this one. I haven't laughed this hard, or this uninterruptedly, for months. And I'm not being overly dramatic — with increasing embarrassment, I found tears streaming down my face quite often, doing everything possible to quiet down potentially obnoxious laughing fits. It's been a month since the film was released — the theater was hardly packed — but it was clear that the people around me were in similar states of shock. This is a comedy worth celebrating. As soon as I left the theater, I wanted to see it again. (Pardon the cliché: there's a reason we have them.)In Spy, McCarthy portrays Susan Cooper, a CIA analyst who spends her days acting as the well-trained ear to 007-esque field agent Bradley Fine (Jude Law). She's been stuck at her desk for years, aiding him on each and every mission — it's only inevitable that she, a lonely heart who hasn't been in a relationship for a while — fall for his charming ways. But after an incident leaves him out of the picture, Susan realizes that she would make for a good spy: she is knowledgeable when it comes to the field and knows quite a bit of self defense.Reluctantly, her supervisor (Allison Janney) agrees with her suggestion, sending her to Paris to thwart a terrorism plot involving powerful criminals Sergio De Luca (Bobby Cannavale) and Rayna Boyanov (Rose Byrne). Constantly interrupting the mission is Rick Ford (Jason Statham), a rogue agent who lets his ego get in the way of successful plotting. Though initially nervous, Susan finds herself thrilled by her new job — she might even be, dare she say it, better than Fine. Paul Feig, the man behind Bridesmaids and The Heat, mixes action and comedy with such skill that we almost forget that seeing McCarthy convincingly fist fight with a baddie should seem strange — but McCarthy, thanks to a terrific comedic performance and Feig's screenplay, is never anything less than a wrecking ball of laughs. She can sell a barbed insult as well as she can make the most of her initially mousy façade — McCarthy is one of the greatest comedy actors of the 2010s. It's easy to forget that fact when she heads bombs, but when films like Spy come along, we begin to realize just how wrong we were to ever underestimate her. For once, though, McCarthy is not the only actor providing the majority of our abdominal pain. The responsibility is shared by a fantastic, sometimes surprisingly so, ensemble: Byrne, an under-appreciated straight woman, murders her role as the big-haired villainous; Miranda Hart, as McCarthy's ear, is a fine combination of bumbling and shrill; Janney's no- nonsense portrayal provides for some of the most hard-hitting laughs in the film. But best is, shockingly, Statham, who lampoons his image so hilariously one can only wonder what's been keeping him out of the comedy world all these years.I loved Spy. I don't go to the theaters often — money, you see, is too sacred to constantly spend on entertainment — but I haven't had this much fun in the cinema chair for what feels like years. Sometimes, it's good to laugh until you cry; sometimes, it's good to want to turn around and see the movie all over again. Netflix is cheaper, I know, but don't wait to see Spy. Go out on the town with your friends, ending your night with it. I guarantee you'll still be laughing for the next few days.",Spy

146,abouhelier-r,Spy,9,21 June 2015,"A desk-bound CIA analyst volunteers to go undercover to infiltrate the world of a deadly arms dealer, and prevent diabolical global disaster. Spy is directed by Paul Feig and stars Melissa McCarthy, Rose Byrne, Jude Law and Jason Statham. This film is a pretty cliché spy movie regarding the plot, we've seen it all; but I enjoyed it anyway! Spy female focus allows for a different and more knowing kind of parody. Surprisingly there are good action scenes, as often in spy comedies they got the job done somehow and we're all here for the jokes. Moreover, McCarthy is extremely lovable here with a sweeter, softer performance, very different than what we're used to from her. She's a genuine force of nature, there should be a hurricane named Melissa. she's funny and she also can be mean and angry from time to time. Plus there's a certain progression of her character as she gains confidence through the movie, which gives her her most nuanced role to date. Ultimately McCarthy kicks some ass as well as Jason Statham, who is flat-out hilarious in his deadly serious Chuck Norris like monotone monologues - I was crying with laughter - which contrasts beautifully with her expressive energy. Finally you can see coming the third act pivots from miles away but intentionally so. Adding to the humour a series of breathlessly entertaining scenes that make you realise how rare the combination of female hero and female villain is on screen. Without ever making a big deal of its gender dynamics, Spy is an empowering breath of fresh air for female driven comedy. Overall, Melissa McCarthy is very funny, I enjoyed the back and forth of the movie, it's en exciting good time.",Spy

All the characters are interesting and hilarious. ""Spy"" has a purpose, to make you laugh and it does it very successfully. The plot itself is a little thin, but there are some good twists towards the end.

148,stephendaxter,Get through the first 20 minutes and you have a fun action comedy,8,19 June 2015,"Spy is an action comedy starring Melissa McCarthy and Jason Statham and it does a pretty damn good job at blending comedy with action. The action scenes were entertaining and accompanied with some subtle comedy as well as some over the top comedy it really made the last 3/4 of this film fun. The first 15-20 minutes wasn't that great, it was setting up characters and the main plot, and although it had a few laughs, it was quickly losing my interest. And there were one or two more times where it was showing signs of losing it but in comes Jason Statham to save the day because he was by far the highlight of this film. Who knew an action star would be the funniest aspect of a Melissa McCarthy led comedy film. I personally am not a giant fan of her but she has proved to be able to carry a film with her comedy before, so i was surprised when Statham completely stole the show time and time again. As for the plot it was a fun ride, there were times where it got a little silly but overall i was engaged in what was going and they did a good job. One issue with the plot is that similar to 'Focus' there were just too many twists, they were doing a good job at keeping me interested without the twists and the constant surprises got a little dumb but it's just a fairly minor flaw.The performances were, almost, all good and although the characters were a little cartoony the film was aware of that so it made it OK. Melissa McCarthy, Jason Statham, Rose Byrne, they all did a good job and were pretty funny but man, Miranda Hart's her character was just not good at all. Whenever she was in the film i wanted her out as soon as possible, and she kept on showing up making me sigh every time, her character was way too over the top and not funny at all, could have definitely done without her, in terms of comedy. In the end it has its fair share of action and comedy and an interesting plot after the first 15 minutes, so you can have a pretty fun time watching this film. - 7.6",Spy

150,lnvicta,"James Bond, Jane Bond, and Jason Statham - a lethal combo for laughter",8,12 June 2015,"Kingsman: The Secret Service started a beautiful new wave of James Bond satire films. It's been done before but never quite as meta as it was in Kingsman, actively referencing how similar the plot and archetypes are to James Bond while still having a refreshing novelty factor and interesting characters of its own - creating this whole new world for the over-the-top James Bond-esque adventures to take place while the real James Bond canon continues its serious, grounded story arc. While Kingsman was about setting up this elite organization and showing off their penchant for ridiculously elaborate action sequences, Spy has little exposition and throws you right into this hysterical world where Jude Law is the super suave secret agent and Melissa McCarthy acts as his eyes and ears back at headquarters. Jason Statham comes in later as a rogue agent who is as arrogant as he is oblivious. The movie doesn't itself seriously but it never goes into parody territory. These characters, as overblown and ridiculous as they are, still have relatable personalities, and you're willing to go on this crazy adventure with them right from the start. Spy is very much an action comedy - whether you view it more as an action movie or as a comedy is completely up to you. I found it hilarious within the first minute and was laughing heartily throughout the entire movie, but there's no denying that the action sequences are incredibly well done. Specifically, the fight between Susan Cooper (McCarthy) and a female assassin in a kitchen, the opening sequence of Cooper alerting Bradley Fine (Law) where enemies are while Fine sweeps them up in a rat maze full of baddies, and the scene with the car where Cooper mops the floor with a handful of terrorists with little to no effort. If you aren't laughing at the jokes, you can laugh at how insane and over-the-top the action is - either way, it's an incredibly fun time.What I find most compelling about Spy is how likable each character is. It's not just McCarthy, Law, and Statham with a bunch of stoic supporting characters. No, even the supporting characters are hilarious and interesting. Miranda Hart plays Cooper's goofy friend who does dumb things with the best of intentions, Rose Byrne plays the villainous daughter of a rich terrorist and has some excellent back-and-forth bickering with McCarthy, and Peter Serafinowicz plays Aldo: a sleazy Frenchman who absolutely loves women and especially their boobs. They all have moments of hilarity; even the main antagonist played by Bobby Cannavale who is supposed to be a classy businessman has quirky one-liners and the funniest villain run I've seen in recent memory. Oh, and 50 Cent is in it playing 50 Cent. Yeah, it's as crazy as it sounds.As far as lead performances go, this is the funniest Melissa McCarthy has ever been. This is the ideal role for her because her character has a serious job and a serious mission juxtaposed with McCarthy's snarky personality and usual shenanigans, making for some truly hysterical situations. Jason Statham, however, is the real highlight here. The man is brilliant in this role. He's a tough-guy agent that goes around bragging about how badass he is and goes on to do the stupidest things ever while still keeping a straight face and menacing persona - essentially a parody of his usual roles. His rants are comedy gold simply because it's Statham doing them. He proves here that he's not only one of the greatest action stars working today but also one of the funniest. The fact that he even agreed to this movie says a lot about Statham's attitude - he's a great sport and isn't afraid to make fun of himself, and I really hope this earns him more comedic roles in the future.Spy was everything I wanted it to be and more. I laughed harder at this movie than I did at most comedies in the past decade. The production value was fantastic, the pacing was perfect, and director Paul Feig clearly knows how to do comedy but now can add action to his resume. Everything about this movie works. It also allows James Bond to continue its serious endeavors, Kingsman to handle the classy yet gritty side of secret agents, while Spy focuses on the campy and silly nature of the whole affair. I sincerely hope this gets a franchise because there are too many great things happening for it not to get a sequel. On it's own however, Spy is an absolutely brilliant, perfectly casted satire that should not be missed by fans of action, comedy, or fun.",Spy
151,schroeder-gustavo,Surprisingly fresh and funny,8,12 September 2015,"I honestly refused to watch Spy while it was in theaters cause I just thought to myself ""man, is this gonna be another typical Melissa Mccarthy comedy?"". Cause her characters actually really started to annoy me. But this movie was different.It surprised me to see Melissa Mccarthy in a really funny role again, I thought she was great in this one. She had great chemistry especially with Jason Statham and Rose Byrne. I will say this however, Jason Statham is the best part of the entire movie. He steals every scene, he is beyond hilarious. I liked that this movie had an R rating and that it actually goes for it, cause the movie is rude, violent and I just really liked those aspects of it.I do think, however the movie is flawed. First off, even if this is a spoof to other spy movies, you've seen the plot before, there's just no avoiding that by now. Also, some of the comedy aspects don't always work, there was this one character that plays like Mccarthy's best friend and she didn't really do anything for me I really thought most of her comedy was pretty forced. Also, a movie like this should never be over 100 minutes long, that being said, the last 20 minutes of this movie or so felt just forced and not all that funny.Nevertheless I enjoyed the hell out of Spy, it was really funny and I would definitely like to watch it again some time.",Spy

It's crystal clear that this is a parody of a spy movie and not some Tom Cruise action movie like Mission Impossible. This movie is what it claims to be and more. It's a parody but it's really life-like and shot really professionally with no less than a real movie of the genre. The action scenes are awesome and there's also the humor built within!

Jason Statham was really good at his role as a disastrous spy. I also liked the fact that the movie switched places fast, traveling through the beauty of European cities. it was very enjoyable. The reason I give 9/10 and not 10/10 , were 2 gruesome killings which could have been avoided. I mean ,they could have died without so much splatter.

It really was feminist.For example the female leads said sentences like ""it felt good to shoot a man"" and ""he is obsolete"". The last sentence about a man, of course. Now, if a movie where made where a leading male character said ""it felt good to shoot a woman"" and ""she is obsolete"" then Swedish media would scream for someone to be thrown in jail (and preferably castrated also). But when a woman says what they actually said in this movie then it is hailed as feministic and good.Apart from this there were some funny jokes: Mostly of the ""fat person"" kind that Melissa usually does. But it was toooo looooong. God, what a long movie. It would have benefited a lot from having half an hour cut out of it. Preferably then a feministic half hour.",Spy
155,ReganRebecca,Fieg and McCarthy hit comedy gold yet again,7,7 January 2017,"Spy is a blandly forgettable name for a film, but in their third outing together director Paul Fieg and his muse Melissa McCarthy strike comedy gold yet again. McCarthy plays Susan Cooper, a CIA analyst who works behind a desk, partnering with a smooth talking debonair field agent who goes by the aptronym Bradley Fine (Jude Law, unexpectedly hilarious). Cooper nurtures a massive crush on Fine, who seems completely oblivious, to the point where, when he is murdered, she offers to go into the field herself to try and avenge his death. Of course all sorts of complications spring up, but despite having spent most of her years as a desk jockey, Cooper proves herself to be preternaturally adept at the spy game and her quick wits, confidence and brusque attitude always are on hand to help her save the day. The script is pretty solid, delivering up enough twists and turns to keep things interesting. But the real treat of the movie are in the performances. By now everyone knows that McCarthy is an Oscar nominated comedienne, but I could not have predicted such hilarious performances out of Jude Law or Jason Statham who absolutely kills it as one of the CIA's ultra serious field agents who is completely over the top but can't see the humour in his own ridiculousness. Also great: Allison Janney in a small role as the head of the CIA, British comedienne Miranda Hart as Susan's bestie and Rose Byrne as a bratty villain.",Spy
156,lucasversantvoort,"Decent comedy, but too long",6,16 June 2015,"Anyone familiar with Melissa McCarthy will by default be familiar with Bridesmaids, the film that made her famous. For good reason too, she's easily the best part of that movie. So, now that she's the new comedienne of today, it was only a matter of time before she would capitalize on that success. Enter Spy, a film that's the next in a very long line of spy movie parodies, that's occasionally funny but marred by its plot.McCarthy plays Susan Cooper, 007's assistant so to speak. In CIA headquarters, she sits at her desk, utilizing her intel to advise the agents out in the field. Needless to say, she's terrific at her job of advising Jude Law—eh, agent Bradley Fine (Jude Law), but she feels her life lacks excitement. Conveniently, director/writer Paul Feig has just the thing in mind: when an agent's killed in the field, she takes the job of getting close to the target and gathering information. Though she has zero experience, her, shall we say, 'unnoticeable' appearance makes her perfect to effortlessly into her surroundings. Agent Rick Ford (Jason Statham) finds the idea completely ridiculous (because it is) and resigns, but has no intention of letting Susan screw up the assignment and goes undercover to help out, though, as it turns out, he is the one who could actually use help.You'll notice I said little to nothing about the baddies, because that would require me to get into specifics regarding the plot. It's not that I care about spoilers, it's just that, well, who cares about plot in a spy movie parody? There's bad guys, conspiracies, backstabbing, money laundering, you get the picture. No one's seeing Spy for its complex plot, but for the jokes and the parodies. Director/writer Feig, unfortunately, spends an awful lot of time on said plot and all its intricacies. Entire scenes are spent explaining how all the baddies tie together, the scheming, etc., hence the two hour runtime. It breaks the momentum and the whole thing grinds to a halt. What's worse is that, in the end, all this explaining doesn't build up to anything funny, so you're left with that awkward feeling the film's trying too hard to take itself seriously, to render its central story plausible, while it should be precisely the opposite: a comedy, especially a parody, should always be in on the joke.Fortunately, the comedy is pretty good, if a bit PG-13-ish. Some of the jokes fall flat, while others, usually those involving McCarthy and Statham are pretty funny. Speaking of Statham, I don't know if it's a good career move to already be parodying himself as an action star, but he does a splendid job. His character's convinced of his skillfulness, yet spends the entire film needing rescue. He's always boasting about all the insane stunts he's pulled and terrible things he's experienced (apparently, his lover was tossed out of a plane and was then hit by another plane), and at the end of the day, he's still convinced he solved the case pretty much singlehandedly. Good stuff.In the end, Spy is pretty standard comedy fair. It doesn't reinvent the wheel nor are its parodies of the spy genre really original, but it does enough things right to warrant a recommendation. As modern comedies go, there's way worse things to watch than McCarthy and Statham arguing.",Spy
157,Sci-FiHorrorFan,This Film is Very Funny.,8,15 September 2015,"I really enjoyed this Film I thought it was funny and entertaining and the cast is also pretty good. Melissa McCarthy was very funny in this film I thought she was much funnier here than she was in Tammy. I liked the story to Spy it was a low key story but it worked I also thought the film had very good action scenes. Jude law was great as a spy and he played a funny and likable guy and I really enjoyed his back and forth talks with Melissa McCarthy. Jason Statham was also very funny in the film and he plays a different type of character than he usually plays.he actually plays a clumsy character in this film, he usually plays tough characters and I thought it was refreshing to see him in a different role.Rose Byrne also stars in the film and I like this actress she always plays a good part,I found her funny in this film as a Villain.there was a funny scene on an air plane where these two men kept getting Thrown into the ceiling by Melissa's crazy Driving and the men kept falling Landing on top of her and she kept getting knocked down to the Floor which I thought was Hilarious and I Liked Rose Byrnes annoyed response and the look on her face when it kept happening to her.I Thought that was one of the funniest scenes in the movie.This Film is pretty good And it was a lot of fun to watch and is one of the best films of the year in my opinion. I liked that Melissa McCarthy played a different type of character in this film too,she wasn't just the funny lady that made everyone laugh she was also a cool and likable Character that was Smart she goes undercover and becomes a spy and takes on lots of different identity's which I found interesting.Is it original No but Who Cares?. The film was Fun and that's all that matters to me I was too engrossed in all the fun Action scenes to care about originality. I found Melissa McCarthys character quite interesting and I thought it was very amusing the way she pretended to be Rose Byrnes friend but really she was collecting as much information about her as possible since that was her job as a Spy.Melissa has a very funny scene where she rides a moped up a ramp and yells I AM SO BADASS! Then she lands in wet cement That scene was So Hilarious!. There are times when this film delivered some very good tong in cheek type humour and there were other things that I found funny too,there is another scene on a plain when someone asks Rose Byrne what are you doing and she says to him if you must know I'm playing candy crush and I'm up to level 79. When she said that I had to laugh,I know most people probably won't find that funny but I did. This films best points are without a doubt the humour and the Action I also thought the film was fast paced and it never got slow it just kept going and going and I was very engrossed in the story.I thought the Acting was good from everyone and they all played their parts well. Jude law is awesome and he kicks ass and takes names and he proved that he could be an Action star.Even Melissa McCarthy kicked some ass in this film,I thought she played a strong character. Jason was Funny as Hell and is one of the films Best Points,I Like Jason Statham he is good in every film he's in and he was really good in this Film.Some of Jason's speeches made me laugh my ass off one of them was: You really think you're ready for the field? I once used defibrillators on myself. I put shards of glass in my eye. I've jumped from a high- rise building using only a raincoat as a parachute and broke both legs upon landing; I still had to pretend I was in a Cirque du Soleil show! I've swallowed enough microchips and sh*t them back out again to make a computer. This arm has been ripped off completely and re-attached with *this* arm. I love Melissa's response I don't know that that's possible... I mean medically. I also found it hilarious when Jason kept interrupting her and kept telling her more things that he did in his life. During the threat of an assassination attempt, I appeared convincingly in front of congress as Barack Obama. Jason has a totally straight face while he tells her all of this and that's what makes it so funny.It's obvious that Jason is Lying about all this stuff but it was still funny anyway.Jason was a lot of fun to watch and if there's any problem I have with the film it's that Jason wasn't in it that much and he should have been in the film more because he was highly Amusing. Overall this is a good film,the humour is great the directing and writing are good and the film even had some twists toward the end that I did not see coming and I was impressed by them. Things happened in this film that I did not expect and it almost seemed like the people who made this Film were trying to parody spy films because at times there were tong in cheek spy jokes or they referenced other spy films which I liked. I also really liked the gadgets that were used in the film there were a lot of interesting ones.The ending was also pretty good.This film was a Good Laugh go and watch it I highly recommend it.",Spy

There is nothing like a good spy movie, with plenty of action – and then throw in humor? Perfect! And as I mentioned, the main thing wrong with this film was the overabundance of lousy language. It really does show nothing more than a lack of creativity on the part of the writers. Seriously? You have to resort to throwing around the F word in every sentence rather than come up with some clever dialogue? And toss in a bunch of crude so-called humor instead of thinking up something not bordering on juvenile bathroom type-humor? I don't think so. Clean up the next one, bring back Melissa and Jude Law togetherthey have great chemistryand they are terrific with the action moves. Both of them.

Melissa McCarthy is the lead and is sent undercover because the four best agents are all well known by the lead villain (Rose Byrne).The action that ensues are met with pretty good fight and action choreography, along with the hilarious one liners from the entire cast. I think every line of dialogue spoken by Jason Statham's character was hilarious. All he does is explain his amazing feats and accomplishments which no living human being could possibly have done. He also believes there is a real ""face/off"" machine from the movie ""Face/Off"".Rose Byrne is the villain and even she brings some comedy to the table. She might have the best line in the entire film. You'll know which one when you watch it. All the actors worked perfectly well and I was laughing throughout the entire movie.

A sneeze joke, a bat poop joke, awkward unrequited love jokes, a pink-eye joke and fart jokes all within the first 35 minutes. Also, like all of Paul Feig's films, you have Melissa McCarthy being humiliated for over 2 hours. What's new about this one? We get to see Jude Law play an infallible character while Jason Statham completely debases himself in his most embarrassing role to-date. Then there's Peter Serafinowicz as Aldo, a sexual deviant who spends every moment he has on-screen trying to molest McCarthy.What about the action? There's isn't any shaky camera effects but it's filled with quick cuts and terrible special effects. Even worse, Feig randomly uses slow-motion during action stunts, which becomes annoyingly repetitive and is completely pointless. Unlike the The Wachowskis, Zack Snyder and Matthew Vaughn, who have mastered this effect, making it a part of their style, Paul Feig makes it clear he has no idea what he's doing. Truly, a terrible writer and director with bad taste and no style of his own.Can Paul Feig degrade women on-screen any further? As bottom of the barrel as the jokes are through-out this atrocity, the only thing that isn't made fun of is McCarthy's weight. Yet, every other aspect about her appearance and personality is targeted for cheap laughs.So, what can we learn from Spy? You can humiliate a woman in every way possible, even sexual assault, as long as you don't mention her weight.

163,MattBirk,"Same Melissa, Different Story",7,5 June 2015,"I have to admit before I begin that I am just not a fan of Melissa McCarthy. Her type of humor, constant banter or whatever you want to call it, has never really appealed to me. It seems like her jokes are forced in your face and are nothing but one-liners. But luckily, this was a role that fit her better than her past roles (though, not better than her breakout role in Bridesmaids).That being said, Spy was a nice change of pace, in the sense that McCarthy had a sound out supporting cast around her to help carry the weight of the movie (even if the story carries very little originality). They helped balance out the equation, as well as help create some solid banter between McCarthy and themselves. Jason Statham and Peter Serafinowicz were the best of the bunch, their characters were basically just walking clichés and they were hilarious! Statham's over the top, macho agent persona who delivers nothing but the most ludicrous stories was amazing. And Serafinowicz's ultra-aggressive sexual advances were nothing short of hilarious. And the best bits from Melissa come early in the first half of the movie when her character is still getting used to being a field agent. It isn't until the halfway point that the movie slowly starts to decline, the dialog becomes nothing but crass language, Melissa's characters loses all her charm, and the runtime sets in. But as a whole, Spy did a good job at poking fun at traditional spy thrillers, as well as dropping some completely ridiculous, original gags (the bat/rodent infestation in the basement of the CIA). It is safe to say that if you are a fan of Melissa McCarthy then you will undoubtedly love Spy! Comedy is very subjective and like I said, Melissa just doesn't do it for me most of the time. Fortunately, this was one of her better roles and this type of story suited her quite well.",Spy

165,vistheindian,Don't underestimate McCarthy,7,8 June 2015,"Quickie Review:One of the finest spies of CIA is killed in the line of duty. Susan Cooper (Melissa McCarthy) a CIA analyst must now abandon her desk job and go into the field. This unassuming spy's mission: to infiltrate an arms dealing ring to prevent a global disaster. Spy is a surprisingly good action comedy. The movie does not just rely on the only comedian in the movie and is more of an ensemble effort. Spy spoofs the spy genre without becoming a joke itself, but this also means that the originality in this movie is severely lacking. Nevertheless, Spy is an entertaining film with consistent stream of laughs. As a bonus, Jason Statham was incredible in his comedic role.Full Review:I really was not looking forward to Spy. Melissa McCarthy was hilarious in Bridesmaids, but every movie after that was McCarthy becoming more and more extreme version of that character. Tammy was the peak of annoying comedy, it was getting tiring. However, in Spy McCarthy holds back on the zany weirdness and it works.When looking at the premise, it's easy to think ""oh this movie is just going to be a collection of scenes where McCarthy's character fumbles into success."" Quite the contrary, she is actually competent at her job. Yea sure for the physical action she is limited, but she holds her own even against intimidating foes. What I'm trying to say is that she is not like Austin Powers who depends on dumb luck to beat the bad guy. She is constantly underestimated, so when she exudes confidence that's when McCarthy is at her best because so many times she would retort with actions or insults that were such good burns that you can't help it but laugh. Rest of the cast were also comedically on point. Rose Byrne continues to show she fits well in comedies even after Bridesmaids and Neighbors. I want to see her more in these types of roles (I'm not just saying that because I have a celebrity crush on her). The undeniable show stealer was Jason Statham. His numerous, endless monologues about how great he is were hilarious! It's great to see him poke fun at his own image in action movies. It's completely unexpected (the trailer only gave a snippet) but every time Statham started one of his stories, everyone in the cinema started to laugh.There are some tired out jokes in the movie though. Like I mentioned, McCarthy's character is constantly put down for her weight or appearance. So the jokes about her weight and lack of experience start to get a little old. Luckily like I mentioned she does quip back in a funny way each time, but lessening the fat jokes would've been better. Spy, is a spoof of all spy movies ever made. With that comes all the overused plot points and twists that won't surprise you at all. On spy parody scale of Austin Powers to Kingsman, Spy lies somewhere in between. So a lot of the parody is done with very safe jokes, in that sense Spy doesn't offer anything new or fresh. As a result the movie does come off very generic.That being said, Spy is a comedy after all. So all it needed to do was to get us to laugh, and it did achieve its goal. You don't need to be concerned of McCarthy wackiness from Tammy. This was an ensemble effort where the movie depended on everyone in the cast to deliver the jokes. Spy is a surprisingly entertaining film that will hit you on the funny bone.",Spy

It's alright at best. Melissa McCarthy does her job just fine. Her character was always involved in the best scenes in the film and all the laughs she brings isn't from stupid physical comedy (for the most part). Like I said though, it's alright at best. I don't know if it's worth watching the entire thing for maybe 2 laugh out loud scenes. Everything in between that is really forgettable and boring.

Also, Bobby Carnavale and Rose Byrne are the perfect villains and are married in real life, but play opposing baddies. The fight scenes, the car chases, the kitchen scene with McCarthy and the fight scenes at the end are some of the best. Jude Law and Jason Statham are really good supporting actors.

174,moviescoundrel,Shaken and Stirred,8,7 June 2015,"Just as ""Heat"" was both a good cop-buddy movie and hilarious comedy, Feige also double dips this film as an adequate entertaining spy movie AND a hilarity filled comedy. Feige has no problem making his characters seem mortal, via termination . Many spies, good or bad, meet their demise and a second pan of their body is not always obliged. Sometimes a character comes in that was introduced earlier, is quickly killed off and the camera moves to the surviving folk to see what kind of reaction or what type of humor can be salvaged from the faux- unfortunate situation. The film style here is a genre all it's own, and it is refreshing to take in. There were a couple of things that were not amazing in the film, and Feige was not going for plausability, but the issue with the rodents and the spy agency seemed far fetched and unfunny as well as a couple of similar issues. It was also nice when McCarthy was given free range to be raunchy and mean, which she does not get until about a half hour in. I'm not sure what these two have planned next, but I'm sure it will slightly redefine the genre as well as fill it with R-rated laughs.",Spy

What makes a good spy movie is not the outcome: We know Bond, Bourne, even Maxwell Smart will prevail. Its the process of what they go through that matters. In this movie, there is no time you think that Melissa McCarthy's character ( Susan Cooper)is in any real danger. She is basically smarter and tougher then everyone else, and required no learning curve.Even Bond had to deal with smarter ( Dr No) and stronger enemies ( Jaws), and had to learn his craft ( see Casino Royale).

176,AmyJenson1995,Spicy Spy,8,10 September 2015,"As 2015 will definitely be the Spy movie year with the release of the blockbusters Mission Impossible Rogue Nation and the New James Bond movie Spectre, it would be unfair to not have a spoof to celebrate the genre.So here is Spy, a comedy about spies, really weird and clumsy ones with Melissa McCarthy taking the leading role. Knowing the comic potential of Miss McCarthy, I expected to have a great moment and I did. But leave your brain home. This is all about laugh and fun. There is no plot just gags.Melissa stars as Cooper, a CIA analyst secretly in love with the field agent she works with and is desperately trying to convince her boss that she can work in the field. When her beloved agent is killed during a mission and the identity of the remaining field agents is disclosed, Cooper is sent for the first time in the field to infiltrate and neutralize an arms dealing organization as well as to recover a nuclear nuke before it fells within terrorist hands.It is fun seeing Melissa McCarthy playing the newbie spy with funny outfits and gadgets. But the others cast members are also having a lot of fun playing their roles. The most surprising one is Jason Statham who is more familiar with action movie than a spoof. He was probably making fun of himself and it's working. Miranda Hart is also very funny as Melissa McCarthy best friend who is as clumsy as her. Jude Law is very sexy as a James Bondesque spy even if we don't see him much.Beware though, the language used is really crude and probably a lot of people would not like it. But it is the new comedy standard: we love more and more hearing rude lines in comedies, Just ask Seth McFarlane. But you will still have a great moment watching this movie.

Or vulgarities galore. Seth Rogen's Meet the neighbors had more Vulgar behavior then Spy. And Yet Spy is almost a classy movie.

Working as a team its Susan's Intel that makes Bradley Fine look so good. But when Bradley is murdered by the daughter of a mad man who had a dirty nuke for sale and hid it.Only problem is Bradley killed the father before they could find out where the bomb is . And Since the daughter announced the names of all active field agents its time to introduce a new agent to the field. Susan Cooper. Susan has no experience in the field and whatever skills she has are rusty. But she is soon on the trail of the bad guys determined to avenge the death of Bradley Fine. When things suddenly don't seem like they are. And Susan has to rely on people she may not trust to complete the mission.

182,michael-3204,Charming but repetitive,6,20 August 2016,"Clever, creative but somewhat repetitive action-comedy from some of the team that brought us ""Bridesmaids,"" including stars Melissa McCarthy and Rose Byrne and director/writer Paul Feig. This is mostly a James Bond spoof, which I guess partly explains why so many Brits seem to work for the CIA in the film's universe, with homages to Peter Sellars' Inspector Clouseau tossed in for good measure. (I think, technically, Jude Law's suave Bond-ish character is supposed to be American, but he exudes British manners.)The script and direction require McCarthy and Byrne to carry this and they do great jobs, McCarthy as the seemingly bumbling but really quite capable CIA agent in the field for the first time, and Byrne as the seemingly capable but really quite inept international arms dealer who's just taken over the family business from her deceased father. They play off each other beautifully, which is nice to see because they didn't have nearly as much interaction in ""Bridesmaids."" To the extent that the film drags, it mostly results from excessive time spent on McCarthy's increasingly well-worn shtick. She is enormously talented but not subtle. Feig indulges her too often and for too long, but they always have Byrne in their back pocket to help ground the action and comedy when it threatens to spin wildly off course. They are ably assisted by Miranda Hart and Peter Serafinowicz, both of whom manage to charm their way through very broadly conceived roles, and Morena Baccarin, who doesn't get much to do but does it perfectly. The film's secret weapon and only real surprise is Jason Statham, who is revealed to be a top-notch comedic sensation. His hilarious take-down of his own action-stud persona is pitch perfect. He is easily the best thing about the movie and makes it worth watching even for people who aren't necessarily McCarthy fans.The first time I watched this I was underwhelmed, but on a second viewing I found that it works much better with a self-imposed intermission of a few hours roughly half way through. That helped me get less fatigued by the sameness of the action and comedy as the film progresses and makes it a fresher, more engaging experience.",Spy
183,kieranbattams,Melissa Mccarthy is funny again!,8,6 June 2015,"Spy,a film which probably features the most generic title a spy movie could have. The trailer really didn't excite or appeal to me. Melissa Mccarthy to me used to be hilarious, she was somebody who was new and everybody loved. But for every film like Bridesmaids (which i really like) we got something along the lines of Tammy and i was starting to get sick of her. But, this film really made me like her again because it is a film that was hilarious and badass at the same time and a film that Melissa Mccarthy really shone in as the lead role.Spy follows Susan Cooper (Mccarthy) who is a deskbound CIA operative working with top agent Bradley Fine played by Jude Law. The first thing to note is that Mccarthy does a really good job at being this shy woman who keeps herself to herself, but then when she gets out on the field becomes an actual badass and is a delight to watch. Along the way she is aided by specialist agent Rick Ford, played by a hilarious Jason Statham in what i believe is his first comedy. Statham steals every scene he is in with his bumbling character and gives the film half of its R rating. I mean seriously, every scene he is in he is swearing and shouting his lines out with such quality that you really cannot see another actor playing this role and i believe he should be given more comedy roles. The two work to stop the plans of Raina, another great performance by Rose Byrne who provides a good contrast to Melissa Mccarthy in terms of personality.Everybody in the cast was so well casted and this also applies to Miranda Hart who i was surprised would be in a Paul Feig film. Feig loves to work with women and Miranda Hart is one of the funniest working in Britain. She provides comic relief in a film which really doesn't need comic relief because it is a comedy itself but surprisingly.. it actually works! I do like Paul Feig's previous work, i wasn't so on board with The Heat which was more in the vein of this film, but to me this one is better. Maybe Ghostbusters just might be in safe hands.In the end, Spy entertained me as a spy film. It entertained me as a comedy and it entertained me as a film in general. Great cast and a good plot with unexpected twists and turns along the way. Melissa Mccarthy and Jason Statham especially gave it their all and succeeded im entertaining the hell out of us, so to me that's what matters most. Just to warn people expecting a lighthearted comedy,this is very violent and oddly bloody at times, but as a movie fan i enjoyed myself a lot and if you're a fan of either genre you will too.

There are a lot of scenes when you have to laugh out laugh (like the one when Jason Statham's coat gets stuck on the door).

I finally broke down and went when the positive word of mouth started to really get traction. And it's funny. It's really, really funny. But not just funny. It's smart. Instead of relying solely on fat jokes and broad slapstick, the movie repeatedly searches for humor in its theme, the idea that traditionally ""unattractive"" women are invisible in our society. Repeatedly the film digs its teeth into that concept and tears in, taking a break only to mock other forms of misogyny in the workplace. This sustained, thematic attack elevates everything about the film and speaks to what's appealing about McCarthy as a performer. Also, McCarthy's character is incredibly capable, if a little insecure, and so the comedy never comes from her incompetence. I found that incredibly refreshing.It's true that Feig isn't much of an action director, but if you're going to this for the action then you're barking up the wrong tree. Having said that, McCarthy actually turns out to be the most interesting action star this year, and putting her in the role of ""bad-ass"" is inspired. Also Rose Byrne utterly outstanding.",Spy
187,prospectus_capricornium,Flawed But Strong: SPY is A Bloody Comedy with Non-Stop Action,8,24 May 2015,"Not too many action-comedy movies can pull off both its genres' requirements, easily, and it will be a lot harder to maintain proportions between the conflicting elements and still able to come out with something, that's both fun and crazy. But SPY, a deliriously hilarious comedy and an exhilarating action extravaganza, is a stand-out exception.Susan Cooper (Melissa McCarthy) doesn't strike as someone fit for a field agent work. She's forty-something and fat (she might prefer the term BBW), and she's stuck behind a desk at a basement in a CIA headquarters. For many people, she may seem nothing, but for special agent Brad Fine (Jude Law)—whom she works for as his eyes and ears, using every possible technological marvels to relay real-time information—she's a fatal weapon. Being stuck on that job works fine for her, but when Fine suddenly gets assassinated, she volunteers to be sent to the field so she could avenge her partner's death.SPY may come across as a Kingsman: The Secret Service reminiscence. It teems with brutal action and bloody stunt demonstrations, but presents an even more near-fatal doses of comedy, that would surely send you to the edge of your seat, while laughing your ass off. Melissa McCarthy proves to be the strongest asset of this movie, coming out as fully capable of carrying out the demands of her role. Her transition from a timid analyst to an aggressive and cunning secret agent is fast and seamless, but once she's on duty, she becomes something impeccably ready for deadly action. However, it wouldn't feel right to dismiss the efforts of her equally capable co-stars. Jason Statham is a delight to see as the irritable and churlish agent, Rick Ford. He possesses an irresistible charm here, pulling him out of the shadow of the totally opposite vengeful character he played in Furious 7. Miranda Hart as Nancy, who takes Susan's role, when Susan takes Fine's, provides unmissable comic efforts, while Rose Byrne (Rayna Boyanov), and an equally dangerous bunch of villains, are on the other side to make the level of threat at a steady high level. Jude Law has a shorter exposure as field agent, but his deadly verve and intellect (reminiscent of James Bond), is enough to leave a lasting impact. His early demise would actually be the one thing to propel our heroine, Susan, into action. These actors prove the juggle of action and comedy an easy task, making their spotless effectivity transcend past its somewhat flawed storyline. The narrative tracks a deteriorating trajectory, but it's easy to drown this flaw out, once the excitement and deafening laughter dominate. There's a plenty of humorous displays even at moments when death is uttering hello at the scene. Both McCarthy and Statham are both stand outs delivering these efforts, and so is Law, being able to toss up themselves into the claws of danger, while still able to make fun of their incredibly gruesome situations. This proves the film of having an outstanding grip of its elements, managing to keep the proportion between the action and comedy, acceptable. The incredibly well-choreographed fight scenes and exquisitely captured settings, add up to the level of greatness that this film has, to make it arrive into something never less than satisfying. There's no telling whether the showcase of fun and action is going to end , nor there's any hint of it slowing down at any moment. It's insane, I mean, with all those surprising twists and turns you wouldn't expect, it's beautifully insane. In the end, regardless of its narrative shortcoming, SPY emerges in its strongest form, being able to deliver no less than pure fun and action.SPY may be easily branded as merely another attempt to duplicate the successes of its predecessors, an action comedy spy flick with heavier leaning on the funnier side. But SPY is also everything else. It's a suppressed love story about a fat middle-aged woman, harboring an intimate yet unrequited feeling for her partner. It's also a story of an inferior's struggle trying to get past a career level where she's been long stuck at. The development in the latter proves to be a lot more rewarding for Susan, as it transforms her to something she's long wished to be, giving her the chance for her talent and skills to be demonstrated. This rings truth for McCarthy, too, who surfaces here, with her most impressive comic showcase, yet. This is 8/10 for me.",Spy
188,parleon-thedon,Spy - Review: Why so Gullible,1,7 June 2015,"Pros: Every actor in the movie was capable and delivered a good performance. The action scenes where really well-done and violent. Jason Statham can do comedy. Jude Law delivered a good performance. Rose Byrne gave the best performance of her career so far (she's also super sexy in the movie). The first 5-10 minutes of the movie were entertaining and good. My favorite scene was when Jude Law sneezed and accidentally shot a man in the head because of it. Cons: The movie was 100% predictable and clichéd. There were a lot of stupid unnecessary moments (what was the point with the bats and the mice gag?) Melissa McCarthy became the same old Melissa McCarthy during the last half of the movie. After the first 5-10 minutes of the movie, I felt like the whole thing hit generic beats and it was tiresome. The movie was not very funny. I feel asleep during the last 45 minutes or so (I usually only fall asleep if I believe a movie to be boring; Spy (to me) was a really dull, plain, and boring pile of crap.Conclusion: Spy is a horrible movie. I have no idea why some people are accepting this atrocious and unacceptable atrocity as entertaining. Some things where good about the movie; every actor who was in the movie delivered fine/good performances but, none of the actors could save this predictable and clichéd mess from itself. Melissa McCarthy has to stop making these horrible movies; she delivered the same tired old stick like it was business as usual. I really want to see her perform in some serious movie at some point in time. I'm giving up on Melissa McCarthy, she was great in Bridesmaids but, every other movie I've seen her in since than has been simple, stupid, and delivering the same old tired routine.I swear, some audiences are extremely gullible.Finale Grade: F+ (if there is such a thing) note: the plus is only for the performances.",Spy
189,BillSims28,"Five Word Review: Often Hilarious, Sometimes Enjoyably Cliché-defying",7,5 July 2015,"The latest film headlined by an increasingly unpopular Melissa McCarthy (the Bridesmaids Academy Award nominee resorting to such drivel like Tammy,) Spy reunites McCarthy with Rose Byrne (Bridesmaids) in addition to starring queen of British awkwardness, Miranda Hart. Also featuring are action star Jason Statham and Jude Law (The Talented Mr Ripley.) With marketing making it seem like another barrel of cheap, unfunny laughs at the expense of McCarthy's weight, my expectations were not high. I was glad that my presumptions were mistaken.Spy has McCarthy, for the film's majority, playing against type with little swearing or loudness, which ends up a welcome change as it gives her a chance to really exhibit her comedic talents, which are pretty expansive in Spy. She has excellent chemistry with Hart as they share their misery at not being able to compete with the confidence of beauties like Morena Baccarin (Firely.) The scenes with her and Byrne are also notably great. However, the comedic stand-out is definitely Statham. In a role mocking both his own indestructible action persona and the general perception of action films' spies performing impossible feats, Statham gets the chance to parade his talent for being funny in an unexpected and highly funny way. The boasts of his supposed Chuck Norris-like experiences with being a spy (""Everyone I've ever loved has f***in' been gunned down in front of me."") Another great surprise is Peter Serafinowicz, he of the velvet voice - I had no idea he was even in Spy, and his fantastic over-Italian character is almost as funny as Statham's. Byrne is also very effective in creating laughs, with her wonderful 'above caring' ethos causing some marvellous bitchy deadpan moments (""That is the most f***ing stupidest, retarded toast I ever heard."") Allison Janney (The Help) and Law both have some great moments too. Finally, another great thing about Spy is the action. It's definitely not just a comedy, with some exciting action scenes that would fit in any spy action film and some surprisingly bloody deaths.Not that Spy is perfect. The plot is certainly nothing you haven't seen before, and there is still humour which is either too puerile and inane or lazy to register as funny, yet for the most part it's intelligent enough and has enough fun characters. McCarthy more than holds her own as 'established' agents like Statham and Serafinowicz screw up and she takes the role of being the bad-ass action star.It may not be on a level as a spy action comedy with its British counterpart Kingsman: The Secret Service (also 2015) but Spy is a fun time with enough cool action and funny moments to be an enjoyable time, and an 8.1/10",Spy
190,sunraider,McCarthy at her best!,7,6 June 2015,"To start off I'll say that I have not seen ""Identity Thief"" or ""Tammy,"" which were Melissa McCarthy's two previous films that I gather did not do so well at the box office. I did see ""Bridesmaids"" on a transatlantic flight and recall laughing so hard at times that other passengers turned to look at me. That said, ""Bridesmaids"" was a bit too raunchy for my taste and was missing that certain something that made me really care about the characters. I did see ""The Heat"" and found it serviceable and fun for the moment but, once again, lacking that certain something to make a film truly enjoyable.McCarthy's new film has that missing something. It's funny, poignant at times, and full of action. I cared about McCarthy's ""Susan Cooper"" character and wanted to see her complete her mission. The potty mouth comes out, but it comes out in service of the character and the plot as the story unfolds, not just as a cheap device to get some chuckles. In previous movies, McCarthy's characters seems to be rude, cantankerous and foul-mouthed to the core, but here I always felt ""Susan Cooper"" was in firm control of her emotions and brought out that side only when it was needed. McCarthy is also aided by a superb supporting cast, particularly Jason Statham as her hilariously over the top rival.This may be a spoof of spy movies, but it can also be viewed simply as a spy movie that happens to have a female lead. Many of the same plot devices are used. But, as with any movie, what matters are the characters and whether or not we care about what happens to them. This movie basically ends with the lead and two other supporting characters walking off into the sunset. I wanted those three to return for a sequel because they were that funny and that good.",Spy

But, this is the second review I have for a movie/TV show where I didn't even finish it. I had to downgrade it all the way to a 1, because I have zero desire to finish it, and I don't think I laughed once during the half that I made it through.I see a lot of people complaining about the profanity, and I somewhat see their point. Personally, I am not offended by foul language, as I curse like a sailor on a regular basis. But ... swear words shouldn't be the foundation of the comedy. Actually, calling this movie a comedy is a complete misnomer. I understand why it's in the comedy section, but the only thing funny about this movie is that someone thought it would be funny.I liked The Heat. Couldn't stand Bridesmaids. I have concluded that I am not his target demographic, but I thought this one might be entertaining. Nope. And it solidified my fears that Ghostbusters is going to be a disaster. I'll never watch a Paul Feig movie again, and I'm done with McCarthy. Overweight chicks who complain about bad things happening to them should be ignored. The mere idea of her ""chasing"" anyone at any point in time is just preposterous. And there was a staircase involved? Give me a break. She looks like she gets winded just standing up from the seated position.The first five minutes is almost entertaining. I ALMOST laughed at the sneeze. And then I didn't smile again until I pressed STOP. None of the reviews I've read suggest that the movie ever recovers from the flat spin that it enters at the 10 minute mark, so I have no desire to see how the second half of the movie turns out.",Spy

Director Paul Feig has turned both Melissa McCarthy and Jason Statham from their usual annoying and heroic characters to something surprising, added with intense woman empowered violence, comprehensive actions, hilarious and silly adults dialogues as well as unpredictable story line twisting have generated infectious laughter from the beginning till the end. While McCarthy spreads her comic showcase extremely well, her screen time together with Rose Byrne are genuinely funny and impressive thanks to the compelling relationships crafted between both of them even though it's antagonistic in nature.

She's got good comedic timing and facial expressions.Yes, she capitalizes on her looks but it didn't and doesn't take away from her talent but adds to it, IMO. Some things are just funny to see...like a heavy girl on a motorbike falling over (that's in the trailer so no spoiler here). OK, the language is rough but no rougher than any drama out there these days. It's where we are as a society so unless you want to hide out in the hills, it's what you hear. But gosh to hear it coming from Melissa's mouth -- it is funny because you know it's a put on by her character.Jason Stratham?

195,mailes22,Surprisingly funny,8,1 June 2015,"There are some pretty bad reviews going around for this latest Melissa McCarthy flick, so I didn't go with any great expectations. But it was surprisingly funny. McCarthy has finally found a vehicle that allows her to carry a film. Unlike her previous bombs, Tammy, Identity Thief and The Heat, this movie put her in funny situations without being outright mean about her size. Yes, there are lots of jokes about how difficult it would be for a fat spy out in the field. But at the end of the day, the whole point of the movie is that she actually knows how to handle herself, and she's a terrific spy DESPITE her size. And she's pretty handy in a fight, especially armed with a cast iron skillet.There's also a great supporting cast around her, particularly England's Miranda Hart, playing, well 'Miranda' from her TV series. Jason Statham and Rose Byrne both play caricatures, but are still funny nonetheless.It was actually a fun movie with plenty of laughs.Incidentally, it's rated MA15+ for a reason. So to the couple in front who took their 10 year old daughter along, what were you thinking??? The C-bomb was used at least once, there's a brief glimpse of a woman giving a blow job on a darkened Parisian street (completely gratuitous) and the F-bomb was liberally used throughout the movie, especially by the Rose Byrne character who was a real potty mouth. This is not a comedy to take the kids along to.",Spy
196,blufrog49,Wasted Potential,6,16 June 2015,"Previews for this movie made it look fun and initially it was, as well as a pretty good James Bond spoof. It could have easily been made with a PG13 rating and teens would have loved it. An underlying message could be empowering for women and/or the overweight.Initially, I thought, OK, I can put up with Rick's constant profanity, most significantly the f-word, because he was such a jerk. But about half-way through the film, it seems the original writers quit and were replaced by illiterate buffoons whose vocabulary is limited to the f-word, and some of its variations. Tiresome and disturbing. The addition of bathroom humor and sexual innuendo was distracting and unnecessary.McCarthy does a good job and her character is refreshing, except for the potty-mouth. The plot twists are good and the humor is genuine. The film seems to go on a bit too long to suit me, but maybe that's because I got so tired of so much profanity.This could have been a decent comedy for families, at least those with older children. I don't see why the producers chose to limit their audience (and offend some of the rest of us). The liberal use of the f-word adds nothing to the film and detracts from what could have been a good comedy/spoof that seems to be lacking these days.",Spy
197,AliceofX,Funny But Weak,5,2 June 2015,"Spy is a movie that starts out good but looses its way in the middle. It has got laughs but the weak plot brings the movie down. That would be my short summary of Spy.I'm not going to go into more specific plot spoilers but after the first half the story and character decisions stop making any sense. It feels like the kind of Hollywood script that was rewritten a dozen times until all that's left is pieces from wildly different stories. I might have given Spy 6 stars, instead of 5, but I personally didn't like the way some characters turned out and some parts of the film felt condescending. Comedies typically start out with a ridiculous premise but it must remain grounded enough. Otherwise the story stops feeling real and you stop caring about it. Which was my experience of Spy. It lost all touch with reality.Susan Cooper was a likable character for me but the problem is she doesn't grow or learn through out the film (like in, say, Kingsman), she just abruptly turns from a clumsy beginner to a competent agent.So after bashing the film I have to say that despite its plot problems it was still very funny and overall I enjoyed my movie experience.",Spy

Contrary to other spy movies, you are not prepared and you just have to laugh as it get funny and hilarious.Warning: if you are put off by rude language you might not like it.

199,asandor,Goofy and Fun,6,20 March 2016,"Melissa McCarthy and Paul Feig team up once again for ""Spy."" The film centres on Susan Cooper (McCarthy) as a CIA agent working a desk job behind the scenes. A mission Cooper was working goes awry, with a friend and colleague killed, and a terrorist group possessing a nuke on the run. She is chosen to enter the field for the first time, to track down her friends killer and stop the sale of a nuclear warhead.This was a pretty decent film. McCarthy's humour is often hit and miss in my opinion, but she does a fair job portraying the awkward and nervous first time spy, Cooper. The humour in the film is often quite pleasant, with action uberstar Jason Statham doing a fine job himself as an overconfident and bumbling super-spy. The acting was fine for the most part, with some hiccups here and there (ie. 50 Cent was in this, and it was not a good choice).I will say that some of the humour was a complete miss. One scene in particular has McCarthy acting as a bodyguard in disguise for one of her targets. She takes a rough tone with everyone around her, delivering absolute sinkers in the form of tough talking insults. The entire scene was awkward and not funny. The plot of the film itself also suffered in some ways. The plot was easily predictable, and the action slightly limp. However, it was still passable on the whole.All in all, Spy was a goofy and fun action-comedy, with Melissa McCarthy showing her acting chops and comedy experience in a pleasant way. The film suffers from a lack of humour at certain times, some limp acting and action, and a very mild plot. However, the humour it offers at times and the likability of much of the cast does shine through, and makes this an interesting film that stands above many other similar films we have seen recently. I look forward to more from McCarthy and Feig.",Spy

However, when the movie starts, I couldn't stop laughing. Everything was so funny and not even in a stupid way--they are genuinely funny. Melissa was not over-the-top.

Overall the acting was quite good from everyone, nobody ruined any parts of the film with their performances. Some of the cinematography was good, nothing phenomenal though. However, some jokes did fall flat or were just over used. The film does try to parody spy films but ends up sticking to common tropes instead of commenting on them.

When her object of desire disappears in action, McCarthy somehow wiggles herself into action and creates mayhem everywhere she turns up - more or less all the comedy is about poking fun at her being such unwitting heroine of action but instead of cruel jokes we are actually laughing along with her, because McCarthy shows unexpected bravery and is bouncing enthusiastically at enemies. In the best cinematic tradition, she even gets herself a sidekick who is far clumsier than herself (excellent Miranda Hart) and there are some brilliant parts by Peter Serafinowicz , Jason Statham and fierce, spoiled heiress Rose Byrne.

Some of the jokes I've already seen in The Heat, and the presence of 50 Cent is entirely unnecessary. But there were also some jokes that were just plain awkward, such as a gag involving a camera and even a vomit joke that was really gross and dumb. I did laugh out loud in the theater a few times, but not every joke hit for me. Jason Statham was hilarious in Spy, but I felt that McCarthy was making some tired jokes about fatness and some dialogue that was already used in other spy comedies. I'd say watch something way funnier like The Heat or movies in theatres right now such as Minions(which I laughed hard at throughout in the theater.) I won't say this is a bad choice, I laughed at some parts and the action is cool, but it's just your typical American comedy with fart jokes and fat guy/lady slapstick.

It sounds like something said by the barely literate twitter teenagers who must surely be the only people that could possibly be interested in watching this.The direction is mediocre, workmanlike and unimaginative.The casting leaves a lot to be desired. Apparently Feig has worked with McCarthy a lot, and her playing a lead in this just seems like lazy nepotism.Jude Law is terrible as the CIA's top agent, his US accent is weak, and his embarrassment is topped ( no pun intended) by his terrible toupee.saving graces are Jason Statham, spoofing his on screen persona brilliantly, but his potential is totally wasted.Miranda Hart- an actress I have never particularly liked- is surprisingly good here, and brings an energy the film doesn't deserve.",Spy
210,SouthernViews,Extremely Funny Movie,9,14 June 2020,"Spy is a great movie. The script has some fun twists, and Jason gives a truly standout comedic performance. Melissa is on her game as always. I think many of the 1-Star reviews are from people that just don't like her.
When the movie ended, all I could think was it was the start of a new franchise. I was surprised there wasn't a sequel.
IMO this ranks with the rebooted 21 Jump Street for a fun, laugh out loud, comedy thriller.",Spy
211,mompaxton-481-121381,"Bravo, what a fun ride",8,15 September 2015,"Gotta love Melissa McCarthy, she gets it done with class, style, humor and just enough slapstick to keep the movie flowing. Most ""big girl"" movies come across as stupid and condescending, but this one makes her look tough without any of the normal fat girl clichés. Jude Law was delicious as always, but I wanted to give him some chapstick through the entire movie. Did he get his lip done or something? Not sure, but still adorable. Loved the well placed plot twist that really made the movie wrap things up. Jason Statham...who doesn't love him. Bad boy turned lovable dork. Nothing gets better than that. Unforeseen star of the movie was Miranda Hart. What a perfect Cagney to Melissa's Lacy. They make a great Thelma and Louise. I can see them working together again. Saving the world one asthma attack at a time.",Spy
212,BrentHankins,Well... it's a movie.,6,4 June 2015,"Writing a review of a film for which I have no strong opinion is always  something of a tedious task, but less than 48 hours after sitting  through 20th Century Fox's Spy, I find myself having trouble recalling  more than a handful of moments that truly resonated with me. The film  marks the third team-up for director Paul Feig and funny lady Melissa  McCarthy - the duo previously worked together on The Heat and  Bridesmaids, which served as McCarthy's breakout role - and the formula  is definitely beginning to wear out its welcome.  This time around, McCarthy is Susan Cooper, a CIA agent who spends her  time behind a desk as the handler for Bradley Fine (Jude Law), a  dashing James Bond clone with whom Susan is smitten. When a mission  goes wrong, Cooper volunteers to be sent into the field to clean things  up - much to the surprise of her boss (Alison Janney) and Fine's rival,  Rick Ford (Jason Statham).  Cooper is tasked with keeping tabs on the daughter (Rose Byrne) of a  wealthy arms dealer as she partners with an intermediary (Bobby  Cannavale) to secure the sale of a nuclear weapon. If you're familiar  with McCarthy's other work, then you can probably guess that she  bumbles and fumbles her way through the mission, getting herself deeper  entrenched in the dangerous world of espionage.  The film takes a somewhat surprising twist around the halfway point,  with Susan's personality undergoing a dramatic change that makes her  interactions with the other characters infinitely more entertaining.  This is also around the time that Spy significantly ramps up the  action, including a wild chase scene through the streets of Budapest,  complete with plenty of mayhem and collateral damage, and a hilarious  hand-to-hand combat sequence in a restaurant's kitchen.  Unfortunately, it takes entirely too long for Spy to get to this point,  and sitting through the first hour is an exercise in perseverance. The  action scenes and the added humor are a welcome addition, but as with  most other movies about secret agents, the third act pulls out a couple  of implausible surprises that strain credulity - even for an absurdly  comic outing such as this one.  But the biggest problem with Spy isn't the length or pacing - although  both of those are big issues - it's that most of it feels bland and  unimaginative. Take, for example, Susan's lecherous Italian wheelman  (Peter Serafinowicz), who can't seem to keep his hands from wandering  to her breasts and buttocks every few seconds. It's mildly amusing - if  not a little creepy - the first time, but it quickly wears out its  welcome by repeating endlessly. It just feels lazy, as if the writers  couldn't be bothered with giving the character any personality traits  other than this one.  McCarthy is about as good as can be expected, but she's not really  stretching the limits of her range here, and Law is well-cast as the  mischievous and debonair secret agent archetype. But the film's  funniest moments come courtesy of Byrne and Statham, the latter of  which is at his absolute comedic best in a role that can only be  described as a swaggering, foul-mouthed version of Inspector Clouseau.  Spy is neither a great film, nor a terrible film - it merely exists,  and seems to perfectly comfortable with that achievement alone. Moments  of vapidity and comic brilliance are doled out in equal measure, with  enough to ensure that audiences won't regret buying a ticket. But they  likely won't be terribly excited about spending that ten bucks, either.",Spy
213,fabiolpinheiro1993,A brilliant crafted film with a lot to say and that showcases just how brilliant McCarthy is.,10,7 June 2015,"Melissa McCarthy is my favorite comedy actress (alongside Julia Louis-Dreyfus) and i'm in for everything she does, no matter what, but Spy is in another level because it was my most hyped comedy this year, and my expectations were very high, just like when The heat came out. And... I just loved it, and i have a strong feeling this is going to be my favorite comedy of the year. This is that good. The film not only is super original, but it is one of the better conceived comedies of all time. Paul Feig and Melissa have now become the strongest pair in comedy, and they deliver, and deliver and continue to deliver throughout the entire film, and one of my most important things to love a comedy is being as funny in the first minute, as in the second, the third and so on until the last one, and this film will make you laugh all the time, and i really mean laugh like your belly is hurting. Melissa delivers her biggest character yet and also performance, and she further proves how brilliant she is, there isn't no one like her, she could be in a terrible movie and make you laugh.But she doesn't only make you laugh, she also shows brilliant vulnerability to make a better than perfect character. The script is as solid as oak and while of course she is the biggest star by far, she is accompanied by brilliant performances and characters, the biggest one next to her, being Rose Byrne which delivers an incredible performance as one of the biggest villains of all time, she is just scene stealing. But Jason Statham is also amazing, and his character delivers many unforgettable scenes, and Jude Law and Miranda Hart also deliver great performances and laughs.One of the things i liked more, was how fresh, original, creative the humor is, is different from everything you ever saw, downright brilliant. I wont spoil nothing, but the story is just perfect, and deconstructs the stereotypes we are used to, to deliver a twisted story, which shows how we should have a lot more films centered on female characters, tall, short, fat, skin, white, black, or whatever, that are this brilliant crafted. We need more if this, so people can realize that the better things are on going against the rules society created on what you should or shouldn't do or be. There are a lot unforgettable scenes, including many action scenes that are better choreographed and crafted that most of the action scenes in many action films, but my favorite one has to be the fight in the kitchen (i cant say more for spoilers sake).This is not only one of the best comedies of all time but a brilliant crafted film, with perfect storytelling, brilliant performances, in particular of course Melissa M, that delivers her better character and performance yet, showcasing once more that she is the reason for her films being so great; tridimensional characters, many, many, many surprises and overall is a film that not only wants to make you laugh all the time until your belly hurts, but one that wants to be more, that goes beyond what you expect, that goes for the new and fresh rather than being just lazy and whats been done tons of times, a film that has a lot to say and you should listen.This will go down has a tipping point, and i cant wait for Melissa McCarthy's next film. Also, Spy will definitely be a huge franchise, so we wont stay long without the next one is announced. Just perfect, watch it as many times as you can because its impossible for you not to love it.",Spy
214,blpkst,"Melissa McCarthy is No 007, She's More Entertaining",10,6 June 2020,"This is a crazy, hilarious and smart comedy. What makes this caper work so well is that you are in on the joke. Spy makes great fun of everything about espionage and McCarthy is a great foil. She's a dedicated employee who works behind the scenes as the eyes of one of the top spies in the field played by Jude Law who she's crazy mad in love with. Her banter with him is hilarious whether she's having a dinner with him or telling him to duck from impending peril. Jude's cover gets blown and McCarthy ends up going to Europe for field work. Instead, she takes her assignment to another level. The movie gets even funnier as Europe is lampooned. Miranda Hart also shines brightly. This movie makes me laugh out loud even when I view it by myself.",Spy
215,templar77099,"Aldo,Rick, you deserve a movie of your own!",7,5 July 2015,"Let me just tell you, straightforward, that the characters I loved the most in ""Spy"" were Rick Ford, played by Jason Statham and also Aldo, played by Peter Serafinowicz. Well, the latter actor was until I saw the film, unknown to me, but I liked his performance so much that I feel the need to watch a couple of his other flicks. I also liked Rayna Boyanov, played by the sexy and beautiful Rose Byrne (I mean, God she is so bloody hot!). But, as you could've understood, I didn't name the main character, Susan Cooper as one of my favourite. Well, that's because I don't like Melissa McCarthy that much. She is one of the reasons why I didn't like the film more. ""Spy"" is itself a self-aware parody to the spy-thriller movie genre, namely to the Bond Movies.The movie starts as a typical Bond Movie would start, with Bradley Fine,played by Jude Law, a secret agent, in Bulgaria trying to uncover the hidden location of a nuclear bomb. Jude was perfect for this role, because, despite this being a comedy, with his performance he could give the film a bit of seriousness. I even thought to myself while watching this first scene ""Damn, he could be a fine James Bond!"". After the thrilling ending of all this first scenes, we have a credits sequence, the most bondesque thing they could have put in there. I liked it, because it reminded me the desperate I am for ""Spectre.""But well, then is Melissa McCarthy 'till the end. Thank God we have those other three characters plus Bradley Fine, otherwise I would have hated the movie. I don't she is a bad actress, I just simply don't like her that much. And those scenes she shared with Nancy (played by Miranda Hart), well, I didn't like them at all,specially the one in the bar, where they end up meeting one of the best secret agents on CIA, Karen Walker. The gags in there are so enforced they were cringe worthy, at least for me. A major part of the movie, besides the jokes, were the action sequences. Well, in general, they where pretty good, although I think Paul Feig used slow-motion too much, reminding me of that despicable Hercules movie we had last year, starring Kellan Lutz. But, as I said before, Aldo, Rick and Rayna won the film, making it very enjoyable. The scenes which contained one of these three characters ore the ones I laughed the most. One line from Aldo made me laugh really hard - ""One day, lady superspy Susan Cooper, I will f**k you."" Paul Feig really needs to be given credit for the direction and the script. The parodies are the kind of film that can go worse if not handled properly, and I think that Feig really made it a real enjoyable flick.""Spy"" is truly an enjoyable movie, and if you, unlike me, like Melissa McCarthy, you'll certainly love it.Aldo and Rick, team up!",Spy
216,bdl7431,It's a satire of James Bond/all other action hero movies -,8,7 July 2015,"Frankly, I gave it an 8 because I thought the 7+ rating given by the users at large is accurate - not bad, but not high art either. Spoiler alertThe movie is basically a satire of other spy films, especially the earlier Sean Connery/Roger Moore James Bond era. The film involves the search for a miniature atomic device, which was a lift from Thunderball and Never Say Never Again for example. The movie also seems to take inspiration from an old TV series called Search in that the McCarthy character seems to have a photographic memory and is linked to a headquarters by wearable sensors. Melissa McCarthy - yes she is heavy - but she represents an anti- hero - someone who we think is incapable of doing what she does because of her weight. I realize that most people do not think she is capable of doing these things but remember she does do her own stunts which are quite physical. The film uses a lot of swearing - frankly, swearing is absent from James Bond - and the characters are somewhat more realistic because of it.Still - it has a lot of action and is pretty tense at times. It's enjoyable to be sure.",Spy

From the trailer this movie looked promising, light-hearted and funny/entertaining. Well, I didn't laugh at all, except on the - unfortunately few - scenes, where the likeable, very funny Statham is in. I actually found myself thinking several times ""Is this supposed to be funny? Should I turn it off?"". Eventually I survived through the whole film.
Bland, not funny story and not entertaining. It's a pity!",Spy
219,shadowyx12,What's up with all the hate?,7,8 June 2015,"Watching the trailer, I thought ""Oh no - not another one of these comedies!"" You know, the ones that people would forget about two weeks after its release? And then be reminded of them when they see the same movie in the bargain bin months later? The trailer made it seem like it one of those movies.Boy, was it misleading!This movie genuinely surprised me in that it not only made me laugh (quite loudly, I must add), but also managed to offer something many other parody movies have failed to offer: originality. Although the plot may seem predictable and trite as it contains many tropes common in spy movies, there were a couple of twists that kept things interesting for me.The humour in this film is NOT classy. Expect a barrage of curse words and quick-witted insults to fly out of just about everyone's mouths. The action scenes are well choreographed and perfectly timed. If you're a fan of the loud and immature humour of the Jump Street franchise, then you'll have no problem enjoying the humour here.Aside from Melissa McCarthy (who just shines as Susan Cooper), both Jason Statham and Rose Byrne are hilarious in their portrayals of a ridiculously-hardened spy and spoilt heiress, respectively. Also, props to Jude Law for taking a risk and playing a cheesier-version of James Bond! I think he'll work well in an actual action– thriller/spy film.The only problem that I have with this film is that it's a little too long. Maybe if Feig (or 20th Century Fox) cut it down by ten or fifteen minutes, then this movie would be better. All in all, Spy is a well-thought out and gut-busting movie - even if it is cliché, confusing, and cacophonous at times. The effort really shows.",Spy
220,chaitov,How Disappointing,4,22 June 2015,"I was looking forward so very much to this movie.It sounded from the reviews that it would really be funny & witty. And since it was my birthday,my family and I decided to attend a VIP Cineplex theater in Toronto where you are served food at your seat if you desire. The theater was great,the food was delicious,but the movie was,in my opinion, atrocious & not very funny. I loved Melissa McCarthy's serious role in St. Vincent. In this movie although she played her part well,the film itself was silly & actually boring. The actors played their roles well,but the script,including bathroom humour,stupid dialogue,and not being very credible, was so mediocre that at one point I actually fell asleep.My grown son kept hoping it would soon be over. There have been so many intelligent parodies & witty comedies in the past:""Some Like it Hot"" from 1959 by Billy Wilder,all the Pink Panther movies,Johnny English with Rowan Atkinson,(Mr. Bean)and the list goes on.The only interesting thing for me was the traveling to the different locations.

It would be easy to call it a spoof, but the story (full of twist and counter-twist) stands up on its own, and isn't just a scaffold for the jokes.And a lot of those jokes work really well. Statham in particular raises a lot of laughs playing an absurdly tough tough guy, McCarthy is likable and sharp witted, and some of the sight gags are superbly crafted. There is great choreography on show in the fight scenes too.But it is not without its weaknesses. Jude Law plays American (badly) and lacks charm in a thin role. Rose Byrne is shrill. Peter Serafinowicz is as hammy and unfunny as ever. At least Miranda Hart is bearable until some very tacky scenes with a guest star.With a better supporting cast, this could have been quite special.

While the trailers made it look like a fair film but by the time I got to watch it I couldn't believe how shockingly awful this film is. The comedy (or the lack of comedy) was completely unfunny, the acting was poor and cheesy, has an unnecessary showing of an actual dick in it, lots of boring yakking, shouting childish insults and Jason Statham acting like an immature child. Gosh, was this film even made by real people or was it made by Teletubbies? I just can't believe Jude Law and Jason Statham would stoop so low to being in this filthy pig stein of a movie just for a quick cheque. Somewhere at the beginning of this film I was actually considering turning this film off, sure the film did get better but it was still like a pair of dirty underwear pants that just wouldn't wash. Never again I'm I going to watch another film starring Melissa McCarthy, not even in the upcoming Ghostbusters movie.Overall, of all the films I've seen come out in 2015, this is by far the worst movie of 2015.

223,AkelaLoneWolf,Funny - if you look through the spy movie tackiness and facade,8,11 October 2015,"This movie brought immense enjoyment; we missed it during its first round in theaters and the raving reviews piqued my interest. After watching it on board a flight, I believe this warranted an 8-plus on IMDb. This was an ode to the ""uncool nobodies"" who got belittled and bullied all their lives, as well as to the underdogs who did the donkey work while the lucky ones got all the credit and glory. Here the director painted a parody of the overrated and much-fantasized life in the world of secret agency and caricatured his ""supposedly cool field agents"" - the boastful, the crazy, the egoistic. And all these suave and graceful creatures fell prey either to the brute force or the charms exerted by our overweight motherly chief protagonist. Improbable as it may seem, she was more lethal than the whole ""good looking"" lot added together. There was incessant laughter throughout; even the antics by the British-Italian sidekick was amusing. The acidic and fiery yet sincere interaction between the two lady characters was quite successful in creating an intriguing bond, one would say almost a quasi-sisterhood. The soundtrack was sizzling hot, and seeing the once-just-as-hot Jude Law make a fool of himself was paradoxically still a turn- on. And the moral of the story in this secretive world was incredibly down-to-earth: believing in oneself is the key to success.",Spy

After the last couple of Melissa McCarthy films I've seen, I was not looking forward to this one. But she did a really good job; if felt like she toned down the bumbling Kevin James-ness unlike she has done in the past; yes, it's still there from time to time but not overdone. The one person I loved in this film is Jason Statham, this is a different roll for him, he is really funny and I feel like some of the stories he tells are things that happened in Jason Statham's other films.The story is good but not really original and the film is forgettable. although, SPY has a great mix of comedy and action.

225,bardia-moose,Guaranteed To Make You Laugh,7,7 June 2015,"SPY (2015) follows a desk-bound CIA analyst, the unsung hero behind some of the agency's most important missions, who volunteers to go undercover in order to infiltrate the world of a deadly arms dealer and, in doing so, prevent a global disaster.After having seen Tammy, I was done with Melissa McCarthy's comedy. She was great in Bridesmaids, good in The Heat, and an absolute train wreck in Tammy. There seemed to be this negative linear relationship where, as time passed the quality of her comedy decreased. Then along came SPY, and I'm right back in her camp. For me this movie didn't necessarily rejuvenate her comedy career, rather it changed my perception of her as a comedy actor for the better. She's quite funny in this, and while there's the expected fat joke sprinkled here and there, SPY doesn't rely on them to be funny. In fact, it's better off without them; it depends more on the talented cast, which includes Jason Statham, Rose Byrne, and Jude Law, as well as on how director Paul Feig uses them.Not only does Feig show us he can do comedy but that he can do action as well, which makes me very excited for his upcoming Ghostbusters reboot. The fine balance between the two genres make SPY one of the year's must see.Jason Statham plays the character you'd expect Jason Statham to play. You know he's badass, but did you know that he's funny? Because he is! This guy is flat out hysterical, easily the highlight of the film. OK, maybe not 'easily' but I'm telling you, this guy steals every scene he's in. There's this monologue, for instance, that he goes off on that had me literally gasping for air; I laughed so hard that tears were actually forming around my eyes.This movie certainly lives up to its R rating; it's violent, there're a ton of f-bombs, and there's brief male frontal nudity. The actual story is pretty clichéd; you've seen it before many times, and while the second half felt quite saturated with one-note characters and explicit language, SPY is a movie that's guaranteed to make you laugh.",Spy

You get more refined, educated and thought out comedy.I was surprisingly Laughing out loud for many comedy relief and the timing and length of comedy were just perfect. The premise looks like a spy-entourage movie, but ends up being a funny movie more a like a buddy cop move with much more heart.The characters are very well used, Jason Statham, Jude Law, Rose Byrne placed perfectly and take their time in pacing things just to give you a feel for the characters, which is fantastic. Sometimes i thought Jason Statham was over the top, but he was so annoying and the movie made good use of such a a clever characterisation, kudos!! Melissa McCarthy was just very cool. I could see her as a back office operator, could see her as a Spy, a friend. You name she kills it, every role that she portrayed was just fantastic. It was just like a Get Smart but without the obvious over-hyped totally unwarranted portrayal of the spies I can watch this movie again and can easily watch with my friends around. I saw the plot twist coming so no real surprises there, but again the only downside with such movies has always been the end, and this movie suffers that as well.

I didn't dare to eat my popcorn, because I was afraid of choking, so hard I laughed.The second half of the movie is one huge firework of extremely funny one liners and action comedy.I watched it with Hungarian dubbing, so maybe that added to the fun even more, because Hungarians can make a movie 10 times funnier just by translating it with more artistic freedom (for example while ""Jay and Silent Bob Strikes Back"" or ""Asterix and Cleopatra"" are boring in English and German, they are amazingly creative and funny in Hungarian).Anyway, watch it if you can!",Spy

Essentially Rayna knows all the top agent's identities (the likes of which include Law, Jason Statham and Morena Baccarin), so Cooper must go on an observe and report mission to prevent the sale of the deadly device.What follows is an occasionally complicated game of cat and mouse, spy vs. spy – whatever you want to call it. It's the story of a woman who believes she's nothing special and who must rise to the challenge of becoming a foul-mouthed badass (as only McCarthy can do). Director Feig very clearly has an understanding and appreciation of the spy genre, and pairs it nicely with McCarthy's klutzy self-consciousness and mouthy confidence. There are a couple of gags that feel repetitive (like the touchy- feely Italian guy), but one element that stayed fresh and ultimately became funnier as the movie went on was the over-the-top antics of Jason Statham. Throughout Spy, he makes progressively more and more outrageous claims of his exploits in an effort to overcompensate in the face of McCarthy's unexpected success. Just some of his tall- tales include posing as Barack Obama, stitching a torn off arm back on with the other arm, and surviving a complicated chase sequence that he flawlessly executed whilst on-fire. Statham is just one member of an otherwise stellar supporting cast. Jude Law is a solid choice as the insensitively narcissistic Agent Fine, Rose Byrne delivers an atypical role as one of the bitchiest characters I have ever seen, and even 50 Cent shows up for a cameo! OK so that last one isn't one of the bedrocks of the film, but I laughed most heartily. McCarthy is solid throughout, but I don't know if she'd be able to support the film on her own, so hooray for supporting actors. All together I think Feig does a lot of things right with this comedy, but it does tend to get bogged down occasionally with the complexity of the story. I'm not saying it's on the order of something like Inception, but the frequent inclusion of double- agents and more traditional espionage story elements just doesn't really gel with this type of comedy. If the comedy/action spectrum is tethered between Spies Like Us and Skyfall, then this film is more like Get Smart with raunchier humor. You'll laugh a bunch, but it does tend to stretch on a bit too long and frequently features unnecessary or tired jokes.Read the full review and others like it on the Drive-In Zeppelin website",Spy
236,cineastFGD,"OMG, long time I laughed so much",10,13 December 2020,"OMG, where do I start. It's been a while since a movie made me laugh so much. Melissa McCarthy is absolutely and utterly hilarious in this movie. She really was spot on, her timing perfect, I enjoyed every minute of her acting. She nailed the role. In short she is comedy gold.I also loved the satirical take of the James Bond & Co classics and how it poignantly exposes these classic spy movies for what they really are: misogynistic wet dream escapes for beta males - the butt hurt reaction in many reviews here prove this point to perfection.McCarty's character is the complete anti-thesis to the sleek, marvelous looking, greater-than-life male spy characters we have been accustomed to. The evolvement of her character from the classic female supporter role, we also are accustomed to in fex. Ms. Moneypenny, to the bad-ass, hyper qualified spy, who still is not taken seriously by any of her colleagues despite of all her accolades, is unfortunately a role many women still can identify with, and it is a real treat to follow her metamorphosis. Which for me makes this one of the best movies I've ever seen.So here's a tip, if you really enjoy watching classic spy movies, where women only act as eye candy or grey mice booking hotel rooms for the male super star, stay clear from this movie. If you are tired of the classic stereotypical spy movies and want to see a refreshing take on them, this is your film.",Spy
237,lwood28,One of The Best Comedies of 2015 So Far.,8,12 June 2015,Spy is one of the best comedies of 2015 so far. The film is just a giant spoof on spy films. This is probably one of the best performances that Melissa McCarthy has given since Bridesmaids. One person that I was surprised to see in this film was Jason Statham. This is something new for Jason Statham and once he was on screen he would steal every scene because his character was very funny. Paul Feig is starting to become one of my favorite comedy directors because he's probably the only one in Hollywood who makes great comedy films. I think everyone played there part well and the whole film wasn't just about Melissa McCarthy's character because when she's on screen in most of her movies she always steals the show but when there are different characters and are actually funny you actually have a great comedy film. Now in near the end of the film it started to lose some laughs which is the only negative part of the film. If your a fan of spy action films this is a film that you should check out or if your a fan of Melissa McCarthy you won't be disappointed. After seeing this film I'm really excited to see what Paul Feig will bring us with Ghostbusters 3.,Spy
238,YbsuhA,A funny spy comedy.,8,3 March 2021,"Paul Feig and Melissa McCarthy is back with Spy. As far as I can see, they have completely succeeded. Spy is one of my favorite action comedies, and should be well received.First time I saw this movie, I thought ""Alright. This is okay."" I didn't like it as much as I did the next times. I've recently watched the movie, and I thought ""This is pretty hilarious."" I laughed in almost every scene. Much of this movie is comedic genius, and made me laugh extremely hard.One of the reasons to this, is the cast. They are divided into two groups: Americans and Brits. Some is Americans and some is Brits. The Americans is Melissa McCarthy, Bobby Cannavale, Allisson Janney, and Morena Baccarin. The Brits is Jude Law, Jason Statham, Miranda Hart, and Peter Serafinowicz. And then, there's Rose Byrne as the Australian. Melissa McCarthy is as funny as she always is, and makes some of the best and funniest scenes in the movie. She plays the leading role perfectly. But the best performance in the movie, is by no doubt Jason Statham. He is the funniest he has ever been. And for a guy whose chasing and killing bad guys, and driving in car chases, he's pretty hilarious as the spy who wants to do everything himself.This is a very funny spy comedy which works pretty well, and I'm just waiting on the sequel (please, let it be). The only bad thing in the movie, is that I see potensial several places where the movie could have been better. But it doesn't do what you'd expect sometimes, and it's a little bit irritating. I like this movie very much, but it isn't near the top of the list. But if you want some fun, this is a solid recommendation.",Spy
239,crybaby-30283,"I don't what's with the bad reviews, this is the funniest movie I ever seen!",10,6 July 2020,"I can't believe it got such bad reviews, good thing rotten tomatoes knows funny, good movies because this is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen! From beginning to end, I never got bored, there's no cheesy parts. All the characters are hilarious, especially Jason Statham! Even Rose Byrne is so funny, they all just play well off each other. Yes I know people see Melissa Mcarthy and automatically think it's dumb humor. But it's definitely not, even though she's the main character, all the characters are so beyond funny. There's no stupid dumb humor, it's all really funny. It does help the write did writing for the show office as well. I love how Melissa McCarthy gets stuck with all these really stupid old lady disguises, with cats and she doesn't even own a cat. But Jude law and even her dump partner get awesome undercover disguises. Melissa Mcarthy is mostly behind the desk, but when the man she's in love with gets killed, or she thinks he gets killed. She decides to become a field agent. She has some experience and knows what to do and is smart. But Jude law has kept her behind a desk so long. She doesn't think she can be as good as him, but she goes just to get vengeance for him. Through the movie, with luck and using her brain, she actually becomes a really great spy. With Jason Statham not following the rules, he goes to find find Rose Byrne as well. But she knows all their field agents. So through this whole undercover process, he's just so funny and hilarious and one thing after another. You can't get bored and you laugh the entire time! I can't see how anyone can hate this movie, unless they have no sense of humor. I love the whole movie, the concept and the actual writing is so funny. I would have watched spy 2 if they made it. But I doubt they will ever make it. I'm so sick of stupid humor, with farting and burping and smoking pot. The only other funny movie is bridesmaids and makes me think of that movie when I watch this. I like all the characters and how well they all bounce off each other. It's really good writing and good movie! I even watched the unedited version because we are so obsessed with this movie in my house! Get a sense a humor and watch this. It's a must!!!!",Spy
240,kshirad,Undercover hasn't been this much fun!!,9,23 May 2015,"Melissa McCarthy, known as one of the bridesmaids who stole every scene she's on in ""Bridesmaids"", as a hilarious foul-mouthed cop in ""The Heat"", returns for another round of comedic turns in her latest movie ""Spy"". Teaming up with Jason Statham, Jude Law, and once again with Rose Byrne, this summer flick shows her how much far she can go to be one of the most comic actors/actresses alive.Spy begins as a spoof to the James Bond movies, where the CIA is trying to find a nuclear bomb that is hidden by Rayna Boyanov, who is trying to make a deal with De Luca, one of the most powerful man in the world. As it turns out, the mission wasn't quite as it should be, until one of the desk-analyst is summoned to go on the field.Undercover movies has been done countless times, but never been this much fun. One of the reasons is that it packs many surprises as much as the jokes. The casts are all around wonderful. And of course, all of this wouldn't work without McCarthy's presence. She threw everything on the table. While the gags are a collection of hit-and-miss, it is the action that flips the table around. Paul Feig's direction in here is very impeccable. He gives the actors a room to crack up their inner funny self while other action-comedies out there rely almost everything on slapstick (except the ""Jump Street"" movie franchise).The only critical thing about this movie is the slow first act. It feels a bit awkward because it wasn't really funny to watch. But, when the action starts, it really lets loose, filled with twist and turns and hell lotta fun.See this movie in theaters and you'll come out giddy and happy. Recommended!",Spy

But I adore Miranda Hart, Jude Law is some suave damn eye-candy, Melissa is funny as always and it was nice seeing her take on an action role. Stratham must have needed something as light relief from his usual British crime seriousness; he does idiot well, it turns out. And Rose Byrne was an adorable, lethal, spoilt brat. Just some fun. Maybe I could have done without male porn bits. That 'thing', I don't know if it was real but it was repulsive. Eww.",Spy

243,mikeolliffe,Very funny spy spoof,10,11 June 2015,"It seems many reviewers here are having a bad day (or, um, bad week). If you want an entertaining, well-made movie, this is the one for you. Don't be put off by pretentious would-be intellectuals who wouldn't know humor if it came up and kicked them in the ass. There have been a number of spy spoofs made over the years. This has to be one of the funniest.For the reviewer who didn't see the significance of the bats and mice at CIA HQ - the movie-makers are making the point that the CIA is infested by rodents. (During the past week the national airport security service allowed almost 100 percent of contraband - including bombs) on board aircraft. Despite literally spending billions on the security services, they are sadly lacking in providing either security or service. That was the point SPY made in a very amusing way which proved too subtle for some. Go See This Movie!",Spy
244,evilpinklolita,Loved It!,9,30 January 2016,"I don't understand all the Spy bashers. Many of them claim that the movie is lame and stupid. I agree; the movie isn't deep, it doesn't make a person think hard, the plot isn't dark or complex, and there isn't much character development, but that's not what kind of movie Spy is. It is a James Bond spoof; that's all. And it succeeds in this very well. My wife and I laughed hysterically throughout the entire movie. We watched it in the theater last year, just watched it for the second time last night, and loved it both times. We are Melissa McCarthy fans. She's living proof that you don't have to be stick skinny to be successful, and I think that's pretty cool. We also liked her in The Heat (although we liked this movie more,) and we watch Mike and Molly every week.I'm taking away one star for the cussing. As others have said, I think they overused it, and they REALLY overused it in The Heat. I'm not a prude, but it does get irritating after a while, and I believe the writers could have omitted quite a bit of it and the movie would have been better, especially toward the end of the film. So if you want a lighthearted, relaxing movie and don't expect something earthshattering, give this one a try. I think you'll find it fun.",Spy
245,pogirlshines,Five Stars For the Stars,5,6 March 2019,"*May contain spoilers* The cast was pretty good but the script sub-par. When I got the DVD and watched it a few times along with some of the outtakes I realized the main problem with a fairly decent film was the doggone editing. They left out some really funny lines that would have made the actual film much better. The back and forth of some really lame conversation that was supposed to be over the top was TOO over the top to be enjoyed by me. Again the editing of how long the camera lingered on things for the full comedy impact was not done well. It flashed around on things and made changes from one day to another so quickly without context sometimes, it was disturbing. Cute in parts but basically kind of disappointing. I used to be a huge McCarthy fan but not so much anymore. Her characters are getting too gross for my liking.",Spy

247,barryweir,Another example of the destruction of creativity.,1,28 September 2015,"Much as people want to watch their sci-fi dumbed down in the form of Michael Bay's Transformers it seems that the modern cinema going audience, at least in America anyhow, are content with Paul Feig's fecal offerings. I'm astonished to see this movie running at 7.2/10 at the time I'm typing this.I can only assume that movie is made for twenty and thirty somethings who have failed to grow up, are generally sheltered from life and are intellectually limited. I thought Bridesmaids was bad enough. By it seems that Feig has gone full out on Seth MacFarlane's vulgarity style, but with even less subtlety than MacFarlane himself.Watching this you think you're in for an entertaining James Bond spoof. Sure enough, the first five minutes sets that up nicely. It what follows is a disgrace. In short, this has the potential to be entertaining. But it is ruined by a constant barrage of vulgarity. The thing is that unlike movies of the past that have had vulgar elements in them (say, Blazing Saddles) the vulgarity is delivered without comic timing and without any level of subtlety. Quite simply we see things like (the normally wonderful) Alison Janney saying the F word constantly and then hear her utter words like ""thunderc***"" and we're told it's funny, because, hey, it's a swear word! This goes on throughout the picture, from the initial scene with Statham to a plane exchange between McCarthy and Rose Byrne, where the F word is literally uttered in every possible sentence. I'm not a prude, I swear like a trooper and potty humour is funny to me most of the time. But when it gets to the gratuitous and unsubtle extent to which the film presents it I feel that my intelligence is being insulted.Then there are, it seems, the other requisite elements to American comedies these days, namely fart, poo, vomit and sex jokes. The whole scene with the faked, erect penis, which we needed to see not just once, but at least five times for it to be clear to us that we are meant to laugh, just made my cringe like I have never cringed before. Then you have vermin crapping on a chocolate cake.....because har har har, isn't it funny to see a background character eat a fecal laden treat! When not being vulgar, the picture goes to every length to denigrate the appearance of McCarthy and Miranda Hart, with routine jokes about how they aren't that attractive or how McCarthy's weight is a reason for her character's undesirable place on the social and professional ladder. To think that Feig has the audacity to claim he makes these films to support women and that anyone who disagrees is a sexist. Unreal.If you could get rid of the above then there is the bones of a half decent comedy. There are still a few funny scenes, most of which don't rely on the shock and vulgarity factor. But it seems that Feig can't help himself and just can't take a measured approach. I shudder to think what he will do to a beloved property like Ghostbusters. Slimer with a rubber dick and poo jokes no doubt. Well, based on his offerings so far I won't be going to see it. But the real tragedy here is the amount of cinema-goers who now seem to think this one brain cell trite is fine entertainment. It is ultimately not the likes of Feig or Michael Bay who are the death of intelligent, creative movies. It's the morons who line up to lap it up...and frankly they should be ashamed.",Spy

249,vsd324,A comedic American version of a James Bond movie.,8,7 August 2017,"Spy is an action comedy starring the versatile and hilarious actress Melissa McCarthy. This movie is an American version of a James Bond movie, with added humor—but not in the manner of movies like Johnny English (2003) or Mordecai (2015). It's not a parody. The movie has a rather serious and complex plot complete with red herrings and twists. I wouldn't say it's completely realistic, but it's just enough to make it very funny without being too outlandish. It reminds me of one of my all time favorite action comedies ""True Lies"" (1994), where in both films unlikely people are thrust into CIA missions. Susan Cooper (McCartney) is a CIA agent who works as a guide for Bradley Fine (Jude Law). While Fine is doing field work, he is equipped with cameras. Cooper watches these cameras and alerts Fine of oncoming danger. During a mission to stop the transferring of a nuclear bomb, the cameras begin to malfunction, Cooper's images become unclear, and Fine is shot. The CIA chooses to put Cooper on the field to continue Fine's mission. Cooper has been at her desk her entire career, however Cooper is considered a CIA agent and therefore is considered qualified to take on the mission, although she is seemingly far from fit for the job in many ways. Being that Cooper has always worked at a desk, she is completely unknown to the enemies and can thus work well undercover. Having worked with Fine all these years, and having deeper feelings for Fine than even he knew, Cooper feels it is her duty to avenge Fine's death. She sets off to Europe jumping from one crazy circumstance to another. She quickly become more than meets the eye as her quick wit and even physical abilities are unleashed. This is a great comedy filled with witty banter, British satire, slapstick comedy and even some raunchy humor. Stay for the credits—even they're funny.",Spy

But it left me thinking 'if only'. If only they'd have been more bold, this could have been a great movie. If they wouldn't have been afraid to go all-out and use her to her fullest ability (yes more fat jokes), they could have made an absolutely hilarious movie. Instead they played it safe and did a lot of different types of jokes for standard cheap laughs. When they utilized their main cash-cow (no pun intended) it was very funny. But everything else was standard.This could have been a great movie. They could have kept the plot the same....but they should have added about 10 more fat jokes. They had a few subtle jokes about looks and weight....but to be really funny they should have added about 10 bold jokes. Like I said, I'm not one for slapstick....but for a movie like this, you have to do it big. Don't be afraid. Like instead of making lame jokes about random stupid things, simply have a few chairs explode when she sits on them. Instead of her hanging onto a helicopter, have her pull the dang thing down with her weight. Instead of using Karate, have her squash people. Stuff like that. That would have improved this movie from 5/10 to at least 7/10 or even 8/10. Don't get me wrong; there were some decent jokes with her. The subtle jokes were still funny.

254,Philipe14,"Profane, but hilarious, great Bond spoof",8,6 June 2015,"The best thus far of those flicks that have tried to spoof the James Bond Franchise, done with great respect except for the non-stop profanity and occasional gross sexual humor - but after all, it's an adult comedy. From the opening sequence, theme song and credits, the homage to Bond is up-front and top-notch. Melissa McCarthy plans a desk-bound CIA agent, assigned to monitor agents on assignment in the field, in this case the agent played by Jude Law. When he is taken out of action, the Agency has to assume the ID's of several agents have been compromised, and only someone unknown to the enemy can be sent into the field to pick up the case (the whereabouts of a suitcase nuke). McCarthy talks the Director (Allison Janney) into assigning her to the job, which sets the stage for the misadventures McCarthy is so superb at carrying out. Along the way, we encounter the occasional Bond plot devices, like McCarthy being briefed on how to work all her special gadgets (except the lipstick blowtorch). Michael McDonald is nifty as the counterpart to ""Q"" in the Bond flicks. One of McCarthy's fellow agents is dead-set against her going into the field, and walks out on his job. Played by Jason Statham, McCarthy now has the added task of trying to determine if he's going rogue with his own plan to track down the suitcase nuke. Statham plays his usual tough-guy martial-arts action character, multiplied tenfold in terms of intensity and the results are hilarious. Rose Byrne plays the glamorous arch-enemy at the center of the plot to deal the suitcase nuke and detonate it in the heart of NYC, and her face-offs with McCarthy are a perfect match. Even the closing credits are a good laugh, and stick around for an out-take with Stathan at the very end. The only way to improve this flick would have been to have former Bond and secret-agent actors do short cameos, like Daniel Craig sitting at the blackjack table in the casino, Pierce Brosnan and Timothy Dalton bump into each other walking down the hallway at the Agency, or Barbara Feldon as some sort of administrator at the Agency. Maybe in the sequel, of which there has to be at least one, because this trip ended way too soon.",Spy

This movie is as bad as an Adam Sandler movie, and it has the exact same type of humour. This movie is not funny. Not at all. I mean seriously? A fight scene where two people are vomiting on each other is supposed to be funny? Does Paul Feig think his audience is in grade school? How this film is getting positive reviews is beyond me. There is not a single clever line- not one funny joke that justifies a positive response. I think I laughed once at the very beginning, but it was more of a snort, as what had happened was more surprising than funny. I seriously want to know why this film gets a pass at being juvenile and unfunny, and why Adam Sandler movies get crapped on for doing the exact same thing. I'm not defending Mr. Sandler either. His movies are plenty atrocious,but at least everyone knows it, and the people who go and see and dislike his movies have no excuse. This film? There are excuses.

McCarthy's boss (Allison Janney, hooray!) wasn't always nice to her, but she made a point of giving her credit for her work. The field spy McCarthy worked with for twelve years was actually not as nice as he seemed, faking her out with a crummy present in a fuzzy, hinged jewelry- store box, but even worse, convincing her to remain his handler when she could have been a field agent years ago. So basically sweet-talking her into letting her career stall for his benefit.Anyway, nicely done; I hope to watch it again in a few years with my son when he's old enough.",Spy

Rose Byrne, Miranda Hart, and Peter Serafinowicz were also quite funny.Another thing that made you crack up were some of the fight scenes (mainly the ones with McCarthy). The stunts and moves they did on people gave you a laugh.And a lot of the jokes were just absolutely hysterical. They are so clever that you cannot stop laughing after you hear it and you wonder how Paul Feig came up with such a joke.Feig did an outstanding job with directing and writing along with the great performances from Statham and McCarthy.

262,just_for_movies,Hilarious movie with surprisingly good action,8,16 July 2015,"Comedy (and now action) director Paul Feig is back at it again with his newest movie Spy. Spy is definitely the most funny spy/mission movie out there and there is actually some very entertaining action in it. Both categories are handled expertly and by the time the movie finished it had exceeded my expectations.Paul Feig is a natural comedy director and there is no shortage of comedy in this movie. It leaves plenty of room for action but the comedy is ramped up and ready to roll right when the movie starts. Melissa McCarthy is a natural comedic actress and she is certainly funny in this movie but surprisingly, Jason Statham was actually the funniest person in this movie. His character is almost a spoof on his previous movie characters because he always plays badass, serious men. In Spy he plays a over the top version of himself which is hilarious. Statham really nails it on this one. The supporting cast is not only funny but also extremely well chosen by the casting directors.The story/plot is actually quite generic but considering that this is a comedy movie it almost makes it seems like a spoof of classic spy movies. Basically, McCarthy's character has to go undercover to find a nuclear bomb and stop bad people from using it to blow up the world. A small gripe I have was that the movie dragged on just a little to long especially in the third act. It's all made funny and entertaining though, with the barrage of comedic relief and action that is present in the whole movie.Surprisingly, the action in this movie is really well done. I was expecting this to be more focused on the comedy and the action would be toned down, but instead there was very enjoyable action throughout the movie. From intense (and silly) car/scooter chases to (silly) gun shootouts, this movie packed in quite a bit of action.In the end, Spy had a great humor and a nearly perfect cast. The plot was generic but still fun and the action was extremely entertaining. My expectations were certainly blown away by this hilarious summer action movie.",Spy
263,corazontvc,"Uneven, meandering, at times childish but countered by decent performances",6,26 December 2015,"I've become a fan of Melissa McCarthy since I saw her first appearance on SNL and then it was cemented with 'Bridesmaids'. My affection for her work went over the top with a movie that most people hate that I absolutely loved, 'The Heat', with the incredible chemistry between two great comedic actresses(Bullock and McCarthy). So it was with great anticipation that I got to see this. A bit disappointing really. The movie was fairly stylish and overall fun, especially Jason Statham as a hopelessly clueless wannabe bad ass, but it seems a heavy notch or two below her other work.Like any spy movie, the plot is ridiculous. A spy movie spoof will typically have a plot more ludicrous than what it's trying to satirize, so I don't hold that against this movie. Basically, a timid woman with low self confidence, McCarthy as Agent Susan Cooper, has been playing second fiddle to a handsome Bond-type agent, Jude Law as Bradley Fine, and is suddenly thrust onto the main stage of spydom when Fine has apparently been killed and now a nuclear device is uncontained. She has been holding back and playing it safe but will soon be forced to cut loose. Of course, all is not what it seems on the surface. The movie has strange shifts of tone, from very sweet to WTF? One such WTF moment was when the screen is suddenly filled by a man's erect penis. The movie has swearing and one particularly disgusting scene of a man's throat dissolving, as well as typical cartoon-like action movie violence, but gotta say, was not expecting that. They didn't even show boobs in the whole movie but they show wang? Boobs and wang are not equivalent. The comparable scene would be showing a spread quim, which I don't really need to see either when I'm sitting down to watch what's supposed to be a spy comedy. Hopefully this doesn't become a trend, there are already enough movies I can't take my nieces and nephews to. I wouldn't even go with my nearly adult daughter, even though she's more than seen them, I would just feel awkward and so would she. Wrong context.The action scenes are fairly typical, some funny, like the scene where Agent Cooper commandeers a scooter to chase the bad guys, makes it a yard and falls promptly on its side. Don't know why, but stuff like that worked. Good chemistry between McCarthy and Statham (who is hilarious) and between McCarthy and Rose Bryne (as Rayna Boyanov the daughter who inherits a criminal empire). At times, McCarthy is directly channeling her character in 'The Heat' in order to play a convincing bad ass. So, if you didn't like that side of her, you probably won't like this, although here it is an act while in the 'The Heat' it WAS the whole character of Officer Mullins.'The Heat' has a current rating of 5.7, while this one has 7.1. Don't get that, but I suppose this movie was better promoted with more stars on board. Or, my tastes are outliers, whatever. It's still worth watching, just don't expect genius.",Spy
264,mscherlen,"We get it, you are fat, so we are supposed to laugh at you.",1,7 June 2015,"Poor Melissa McCarthy... No self esteem, no self-respect, and obviously, no shame. She is a person that no doubt has talent and intelligence, but nobody has told her so, which can be the only reason she would embarrass herself with this demeaning, tacky and unfunny garbage, over in over, repeating the previous bad movie she completed before.This train wreck of a film wasted hours of my life, and took down so many actors with its insipidly juvenile plot, terrible script, and inane dialogue. I even found myself wishing my movie hero, Jason Statham, all the terrible deaths he so gloriously dished out in all his previous movies. He is the guy that Guy Richie made be great and funny, but the ""Feig"" that directed this crap made me want to never see him in another movie again...and I am the guy who even liked him in ""In the name of the King"". Please Jason, take that fast car you are known for and drive the heck away from this toxic drivel... and drag Jude law behind you for venturing into this bad choice. Jude Law is such a great actor... please send him to rehab if he is this desperate to finance his habits. And tell him not to share needles with Rose Byrne...such a beautiful lady to waste in this movie obviously written by some potty mouthed sixth graders (or Seth McFarlane).That Melissa McCarthy is wasting her lives on fart joke, vomit jokes, ""Pee-pee"" picture jokes, and degrading herself by just being the fat-chick butt of all jokes at the expense of her dignity, is just a tragedy. I'd rather not see her degrade herself to the point that I will in the future seek out more intellectual movies, like something with Jim Carrie or Yahoo Serious.The plot has been done better and before a thousand times. The dialogue...unbelievably childish and unoriginal. The movie comes together like an episode of The Cleveland show, which itself is just an unoriginal rehashing of ""Family Guy"", which itself is just a rehashing of the lesser episodes of ""the Simpsons"" with all of the humor, fun, joy, originality, spirit and souls removed.OMG, it was the longest two hours of my life.

There's no nudity or sex but there are humorous references to sexual situations. Susan Cooper (Melissa McCarthy) is a CIA backroom girl who goes out in the field ably supported by Bradley Fine (Jude Law), Rick Ford (Jason Statham) and Raina Boyanov (Rose Byrne) as the villain.There's lot of fun with Rick Ford calling her incompetent. Naturally things start to go wrong. The tale has a lot of natural twists and turns. I enjoyed the fight scenes. The best bit is the dialogue with the characters exchanging imaginative insults. Susan Cooper gives as good as she gets. There were real out loud laughs throughout the audience. BTW. Stay till after the credits. There's an outtake worth seeing.",Spy

However, the scriptwriting seemed to be caught in perpetual and unnecessary use of the F word. Not really sure why as this being a comedy, the use of such vulgarity did little to raise a smile and actually became tiresome and offensive. I did like the overall premise of this movie, that a dowdy office agent gets put in the field to infiltrate a criminal plan. Bravo to Melissa McCarthy for an entertaining performance, ably supported by Miranda Hart and a nice hammed up cockney turn by Jason Statham. Just disappointed by the script. Given the box office success, I'd imagine a sequel is in the pipeline, I just hope they provide a few less F's and more laughs next time :-)",Spy
269,vato7959,McCarthy ranks up there with comedy greats,10,7 June 2015,I remember some of the greatest performances like Richard Pryor in Stir Crazy and Eddie Murphy in the Beverly Hills Cop movies. Once you turn loose these comic legends the viewer can't stop watching them. Melissa McCarthy has that same explosive comic ability. Her ability to ad-lib and response to what she sees in a scene and what someone says to her is amazing. She has a beautiful angel face to go along with that devil like smile and wit is one of the best comedy performances I seen in my 60 years. Thanks to the director for bringing together a great dramatic cast to play off of Melissa's comedy performance. I hope they can come up with more material in the future to maximize her talents.,Spy

If you can't LOL at what made you LOL when you were a teen then I'm sorry to tell you but you have grown up into a boring-as-#$%^ adult. People who are offended by excessive swear words CHOOSE to be offended. Maybe you prefer jokes written for five year old's? Good clean fun only for you stupid prudes. The plot of this movie is fairly simple, following CIA agent Susan Cooper's journey across Europe in an attempt to stop the sale of a nuclear bomb. It is a spy parody so of course it uses all the spy movie clichés. The fight scenes are BRUTAL as is most of the violence. Hello, awesome! That is what actually goes down in most spy movies and I appreciated that they kept that aspect of the genre. There are two fight scenes in particular that had me exclaim, ""Holy f%^&!"" Every actor seemed to hit the right notes with their timing and delivery, even some of the minor characters like Anton or Colin/Frederick. I was never a fan of Melissa McCarthy but she was excellent here and won me over.

That said, it's the first time I see Jason Statham doing comedy. Not just Statham, Jude Law has his share of the fun, too. Some action scenes could have been better. Wounds seemed fake sometimes.

I'm glad that I did because it turned out to be very enjoyable in a silly kind of way. I'd never heard of the lead actress, so assumed that it was originally written with Dawn French in mind, who must have backed out at the last minute. After reading some of the reviews I'm getting the feeling that this appeals far more to the British sense of humour than to Americans, most of whom probably don't get it at all.

288,IsaacSage,4/5,8,8 December 2015,"The culminating moment in 2014's atrocious, Paul Feig-less, Melissa McCarthy comedy ""Tammy"" was when the titular character was hit by a car. Lesser writers and directors want McCarthy to be ""the funny fat lady."" They want her to fall through tables and yell at the top of her lungs. McCarthy is good at this, and it happens from time to time in Director Paul Feig's(Bridesmaids, The Heat) latest comedy. However, that's not the only joke and punchline. Physical violence is used as an end to some of the rather exhilarating action set pieces this film has to offer. It sort of serves as Feig's demo reel for an action film. However, the humor comes from the writing. When McCarthy gets to belittle an assistant by saying she is going to staple his reproductive organ to his head so he looks like a unicorn...when she orders a wine that she describes as ""like a hummus""...the humor comes from her intelligence and comic timing, not just her ability to break furniture. This is where Spy truly shines. In the film, McCarthy plays Susan Cooper, an intelligence officer whose permanently talking in the ear of Bradley Fine(Jude Law). In a fun opening scene, we see how it's her doing all the work, as she points out entrances and exits, guards, and traps. When Fine is kidnapped, she has to go undercover and infiltrate a mysterious arms dealer. Further complicating things is his daughter(Rose Byrne) and Ford(Jason Statham) a rogue agent whose basically a parody of every Jason Statham movie ever. Spy is first and foremost a comedy, but it's also an action film(as discussed above). Feig directs action rather generically, but it comes as a fun change of pace from all the verbal sparring. It's also an empowerment story, but a low-key one. It wasn't advertised as such, but it would be the best example of a great female character this year if Mad Max hadn't come out. It is a dash too long, the plot is more than a dash too convoluted, and some of the jokes start to get a bit old. When it's in it's prime however, it reminds us that Melissa McCarthy is not just the funny fat lady, and Paul Feig is not just another Judd Apatow. They are both so much more.",Spy

I watched til the end but totally useless characters, also needless main character just to keep movie long, it would be way better as a 1 hour movie, also nonesense bat and rat scenes. Boobholder man was also needless. Tall girl was useless/ not funny. They paid a lot on actresses and actors but storyline is very bad. I wish they would pay more for writers. I laughed 3-5 times. I guess girls would laugh more. +1 star for rose buuurn(my love) + 1 star for jay +1 for McCarthy. Watch if you have time to burn.",Spy

300,SwishCrane441,"Deeply Undercover, My Arse !!",4,9 October 2015,"Absolute bore-fest, I know people have already vented out their anger of how ridiculous this movie is with apparently no or very slim laughters.I'm just compelled to write this review and have got nothing new to add about this terrible terrible film. Honestly, it has made it in my top 5 films I loathe.Having said that, I think I've rated it a bit higher. Trust me 5 is way higher but then I realized and maybe I enjoyed Jason Statham in his new act. Being his fan and all, 5 stars for your role on breaking the stereotype. Hell, I may want to come back some time later & probably change the rating because I'm fresh of watching Jason in his funny guy persona. When this wears off & I'd open up to the nightmare I just witnessed spanning over almost two hours, idk what I'm going to do, rate it a 1, no even that would be blasphemous!Like many debated how this film got a 7.2 rating on IMDb is beyond my comprehension and by every logic know to man. Filmmakers perhaps rigged and bribed their way to the top. Wait, did I just used the word 'perhaps'? Isn't this obvious that they most definitely employed such underhanded tactics to make this washed up piece of trash stay afloat and fool audiences in to watching annoying Melissa McCarthy or that fat lady from Bridesmaids.OMG! a 7.2, tell me that wasn't real?

Why film makers seem to think that if they get some actors that get really well paid- this will be enough to carry a film, i just don't know. Its not easy to make a good comedy,i think, and its lazy to make a crap one like this. It's just another dick/vagina movie that maybe they hoped teens going through puberty might like. Life is too short to watch junk films. Please spend more on paying people to write well and funny lines.

I wouldn't be surprised if they made a ""Spy 2"" later down the road. All the characters did well. Jason Statham was the funniest character. Always good to see actors that can ease into a other genres. We all know how comedies are introduced nowadays. The good ones are always rated R, there is always nudity, etc. The only frequent thing in this film was the cursing which audiences will get over or find funny. Rose Byrne did a wonderful job as well playing her role as well. Overall the film does what it was suppose to do. Get laughter with action.",Spy
303,kathrynlet,Fun but could have been better,7,20 June 2015,Okay what this is is funny. I loved 90% of the movie. Really there is a lot here to like. Yes it is silly and crazy. But that is what makes it funny.So why only 7 stars? One fight is boring because apparently getting clocked with a frying pan or stabbed with a knife or tossed into shelves are apparently not even remotely damaging or disorienting. Moves that will break a nose if not an entire face in reality a shaken off with barely a grunt. Props for some clever prop usage though.Another fight is very well done but we could have skipped the projectile vomiting onto the newly deceased. I will admit that that vomiting is a likely possibility for someone not used to fighting and killing. But it was too gross to be funny.Language was way beyond what needed to be used. This is my biggest peeve. I really don't get why this had to be laced with so much profanity. There is difference between an upset agent in a profanity tirade and then women using it a bonding(?). Clearly there were talented writers involved so why did the script dissolve to such drivel? Really did we have to include dick pictures? I found that offensive.Again theses are why I took off stars. I think most of this movie was clever and funny and woman centric which is cool. It just had some problems with a few points.,Spy
304,randaashraf-70075,A Serious Spy Spoof,9,3 July 2015,"Written and Directed by: Paul FeigStarring: Melissa McCarthy, Jason Statham, Jude Law, Rose Byrne, Miranda Hart, Allison Janney and Bobby Cannavale. Her roles always root for the underdog and I felt it is always leading towards a major movie where she is the star that laughs at everyone else. In 'Gilmore Girls', 'Identity Thief', 'The Heat', 'SNL', etc. She always spins the negative attitude towards people's opinions. In 'Spy' she does just that on a grander scale. This is not a 'Revenge of the Nerds' type of movie. This movie shows that what you make out people to be is only your vague opinion. In 'Spy', Melissa's character is seen as unable to go on a mission just because her weight and that is an awful stereotype. The time has finally come where Melissa McCarthy showed those people a taste of their own medicine yet in her kind way. This movie is humble and points out everyone's flaws and that makes it all more honest therefore all the more funny. Honestly, if issues like this are not discussed people will not get better. This movie presents a powerful message of peace and love. It is about how no one should hold grudges because words and opinions are all silly and should not be taken seriously or to heart. This movie starts off with a bang. Jude Law as Bradley Fine a 'James Bond' character and Susan Cooper (Melissa McCarthy) guiding him on a computer that sees heat waves of people in his location to guide him. Then someone points out that the rodents that are bats in the office pooped on Susan's cake that she made for someone's birthday. Only to distract her with her loud normal office complaints in an odd situation where they are spies and agents. Susan's friend and coworker Nancy B. Artingstall (Miranda Hart) constant excitement over the whole issue makes this movie all the more real and fun. A Spy Spoof with a purpose. That purpose is to change people's perspectives of stereotypes while laughing at those stereotypes at the same time. 'Spy' showcases, an honest portrayal of everyone. How Susan is awkward, clumsy, insecure, shy and reserved at first particularly when she went on a friendly outing as a thank you for saving his life with Fine. Then he gives her a cake necklace unknowing how insensitive that is. She lets it slide and then tomorrow will be another day at the office. Then later on in the movie as Susan was guiding Fine there were technical issues and she could not help him and suggested it might be too easy and that he should back away yet he did not. So she witnessed his murder or so she thought. Then the woman in video Rayna Boyanov (Rose Byrne) who shot him later stated all the agents' names as warning of their fate. That amplified Susan's emotions and made her want to go out in the field to make that woman pay for what she did to her crush. So Susan goes to a meeting after Fine's memorial service. In that meeting there is one of the agents that is still living Rick Ford (Jason Statham) as a not so bright aggressive macho character. Susan's boss Elaine Crocker (Allison Janey) informs them all about the video and how he cannot go to help so Rick mentions the movie 'FaceOff' which Elaine points out is not a real thing and he states how two American Guys claimed that it is a real thing. This is a nice spin of stereotyping people. For example, athletic guys are seen as less intelligent and how Americans are seen as less intelligent or refined. This movie is payback for all. British people can do amazing comedy. Lots of When Elaine said they needed ""someone invisible"" Susan jumped to the chance because that is how she feels and how she really is. Elaine reluctantly agrees only to discover a decade old video of Susan's training where she was surprisingly good and aggressive unlike her looks. As Elaine even stated how she comes across around the office as ""tame and unable to hold a gun."" Then Elaine asked why and Susan's answer is Fine suggested it and that it is better for the team. And Elaine said 'he sniped you. Women."" (rolls her eyes and moves her chair the other way)"" That shows how many times Elaine has seen this and is bothered by this. This is meticulous directing as well as a script. The actors are an amazing cast. That scene shows how strong women who don't let men put them down become the boss and how women like Susan remain in the background despite their intelligence and amazing capabilities. Susan suddenly becoming the warrior that she is and dresses the way she dresses, refusing to play these geeky undercover roles they give her. Then refusing to stay in the sidelines just ""track and report."" She knew as her friend Nancy told her she plays it safe. Melissa's real life husband's cameo as an annoying tourist asking a silly question at a bad time is an issue that happens however in her case she's trying to chase the bad guys. That was a clever joke. The film is clever and concise particularly with the snappy dialogue. This movie deserves a 4.5/5 if not a 9.5/10 because some parts were far fetched like the office bat issue and Rick's character falling unconscious for no reason. These parts were not needed the movie can be subtle and still funny enough. It does not need to rely on cheap antics to get a laugh. Funny movie would recommend it.",Spy

The pap that has been foisted upon us for so long has made choosing an entertaining movie an excruciating chore... then along comes Spy. If you loved The Fifth Element and RED as much as I did, then you'll love Spy.Sure, the movie is festooned with F-Bombs, but they added to the hilarity. I literally laughed out loud for most of the movie and wasn't disappointed by a single scene. The casting, acting, direction and dialogue were bang on. Yes, it was vulgar but so what? Every Melissa McCarthy movie has quadruple entendres as subtle as an earthquake. Even her TV show, pushes the limits of what the censors will allow. Subtle, it ain't.If you're looking for another Marigold Hotel, do yourself a favour and just don't go. Besides lately, we have had enough heartrending cinema blah, blah, blah to last several decades.,,and before I get cast as a philistine and a boor, I also gave Women in Gold a 9.This movie stars Melissa McCarthy and features Jason bloody Statham... why would anyone expect anything different? The previews don't do the movie justice. They made the movie look like silly slapstick... but it was so much better than that.I will see this movie again and again, as I have with The Fifth Element and RED. It had character development, excellent dialogue and spot on timing. I could keep raving about this movie but you get the point. This is what Get Smart and Johnny English should have been.Take note, budding film makers... the bar has been set very high. If you consider Springer, Survivor and Big Brother entertainment... just don't go. If you believe a movie without subtitles could never be considered worth watching, much less entertainment... just don't go. If you think comedy is truly an art form and can contain depth, character development, skilled direction and inspired performances, just go.Spread the word... tell your friends... heck, tell strangers.

314,dreamtakers,Hilarious but Not So Perfect,7,25 June 2015,"Spy is a refreshing movie to see as action-comedy movies are not the kind of movies that I frequently dabble into. Yes, the whole movie is clearly a parody right off the bat. Susan Cooper (Melissa McCartney), an overweight, middle-aged woman that works a desk job in the CIA headquarters, volunteers to be a field agent after her partner Brad Fine (Jude Law) was assassinated. Angry and upset (because she holds a candle for Fine), Susan wants to prove her worth to the CIA and avenge Fine's death. And guess what, she does a bloody good job to everyone's surprise as she is constantly seen as an underdog due to her weight. During her mission to track down Rayna (Rose Bryne), she crosses paths with fellow agent Rick Ford (Jason Statham) who keeps interfering with her mission because he insists on doing things his own way.Spy is a funny movie. Every moment of the film is laced with humor. However, some of the jokes strike the jackpot while some fall flat. Profanities also tend to overboard, so people who do not appreciate foul language and crass jokes should steer away from this movie. Comedy asides, I highly enjoy the action and goose chase in this movie. The action combats are brutal and violent, but interesting and well executed; which strikes resemblance to Kingsman: The Secret Service. Susan Cooper sprints, shoots, and fights like a martial expert and kicks some serious ass, which is out of norm for someone her stature. Seeing Susan in action ignites roars and laughter throughout the cinema; the kitchen fight scene is one of the funniest scenes of the film. Spy is filmed across many exquisite locations including Paris, Rome and Budapest, providing beautiful backdrops for the film and serve as eye pleasers for the audience. Melissa McCarthy definitely commands the show with her huge presence (literally and figuratively) as an unconventional, not-your-typical agent. She is unfit, untrained and does not fit/look the part. Her transition from boring analyst who acts behind the scenes to an aggressive and skillful field agent is a delight to watch. She eliminates her enemies with apparent ease and dexterity and goes undercover like a pro with a change of style and believable lies. Jason Statham plays his first comedic role in this movie. He is extremely entertaining and surprisingly funny as boastful and annoying agent Rick Ford, who in reality, isn't as invincible nor competent as he claims to be. He delivers his lines in a deadpan manner but those lines are golden! It is such a change from the usual stern characters that he plays. Ford's head butts and constant clashes with Cooper are perhaps the most best parts of the film. Jude Law has a shorter screen time due to his early demise, but his prowess and charm is undeniable. Rose Bryne also breaks out of her usual character roles as Rayna Boyanov the villain, in which she gives an average performance. Miranda Hart provides a great supporting role to McCartney as best friend Nancy and the duo share much comical banter together. I can understand why Spy may be a hit or miss due to its overbearing jokes; but it is more of a hit in my part. It is insane, hilarious and action-packed. There are also twists and turns that you wouldn't expect that gives in to the element of surprise. Enjoy this fun-filled movie with a very unlikely hero that saves the day!",Spy

324,zaneage,A Melissa McCarthy film about Melissa McCarthy being a Spy,6,23 May 2015,"Spy is an espionage spoof staring Melissa McCarthy, Rose Byrne, Jason Statham, Jude Law and so on. Basically Spy is about a desk-bound CIA analyst (Melissa McCarthy) that volunteers to go undercover to infiltrate the world of a deadly arms dealer (Rose Byrne) and to prevent a global disaster.Now if anyone was actually thinking this film was going to be amazing probably needs a reality check. This Melissa McCarthy driven film is to be fair at times funny but overall is a dumb comedy with Melissa McCarthy spurting loud mouth foul language in order to gain a laugh when half the time it falls flat. The thing that made Spy for me is undoubtedly Jason Statham and Peter Serafinowicz who were both very very funny is this film, these two men have the best lines throughout the whole movie and were consistently funny unlike Melissa McCarthy and Miranda Hart's characters. As a comedy I'd say Spy is defiantly a successful one, especially in comparison to that catastrophe of a film ""Tammy"", this is a huge step up for Melissa McCarthy. Spy is definitely a watchable film, like you could sit there and watch this film not hating yourself, although a watchable film however certain things happen throughout the film that beg the question 'was that really necessary' and make you think twice about whether or not that was stupid or funny.Look all problems aside I'd say check out Spy, besides some stupid moments this movie really isn't that bad and at times is quite enjoyable. I wouldn't give this film any higher than a 6/10. It has its moments but ultimately Spy isn't really that clever or original of a film.Thanks for reading and have yourself a wonderful day!",Spy
325,vero-lelimo,The only review that matters,7,17 June 2019,"First of all, when people watch the movie and leave nasty degrading reviews only means its personal. It's amazing how angry people leaving reviews here are... I kinda feel sorry fir them because r I see their blood pressure rising.Having said that... I gave 7 to this movie because Melissa's mouth. I hope she can just fix that one thing because she takes it to all her movies and make her seem like she needs to be vulgar to survive. I just wish she can tone it down a bit.Okay the story was not believable. When the movie started Bradley Fine was good. He killed all bad guys swiftly but towards the end he couldnt but watched as Susan unleashed her superspy skills. I feel it was gonna be better if they fought alongside each other.It was also not believable that Rayna fell so quickly for Bradley Fine that she trusted him in 2 minutes to include him in her nuke deal. You must remember that in the private jet Rayna told Susan that she does not trust any body soooo yea.When Rayna's drink was spiked, Susan only said to her that ""someone"" put a roofie in her drink but Rayna responded by saying that ""could you point the man out?""I also think that a scene where Rayna and Bradley were kissing... When Susan said shes a loud kisser, she should've continued by saying that she SOUNDS like an old toothless woman sucking the jelly out of a doughnut and not she LOOKS... if you catch my drift. But as I always say, I blame the whole behind the scenes crew. The acting was great... I was mostly impressed by Jason. I did not picture him in comedy at all but he nailed it. He musnt do it often because being serious works a great deal for him. It was nice to see him laid back and laughing. The Rock however just blends in everything.Theres another one thing I dont like about Melissa's movies (I realized this on Heat) where most men hits on her a lot. That should also be toned down. It puts a negative spin on her roles. It's unnecessary attention.Spy is a nice movie so thumbs up for me.",Spy

I loved Melissa McCarthy in Gilmore Girls, but not so much of the movies she's been in, while I still commend her on excellent acting most of her movies weren't my taste.Can't wait to buy this so I can watch it 1000 more times. :) This was the first movie I've watched with Jason Statham -and adored him in this role!!!! Bobby Canavale whom I've loved for years is the only actor that I feel couldn't pull off his part well - I didn't enjoy him in the movie at all. Rose Byrne - she was excellent in her role .

Only recently did I see all the negative user reviews, and am feeling a need to come to its defense. Most seem off-put by any vulgarity, and don't seem to know it's a parody when they complain about the plot. I'm pretty sure this crowd still considers Oscar Wilde a gold standard of humor, worthy of their ""intellect"". The seemingly crude jokes in this movie were beside the point. What is most hilarious about this movie are the characters, major and minor. And the crowned jewels of this movie were its stars, Melissa McCarthy and Rose Byrne. Just about every exchange between them is golden.",Spy

331,bonekeep,Mediocre at best...,6,7 June 2015,"I was in the mood for a great comedy and rottentomatoes had me convinced I would find it with Melissa McCarthy's newest... alas rottentomatoes, you failed me. By no means a bad film, but this film truly disappoints as a comedy. Most of the film is fairly mediocre. Mediocre script, mediocre direction, and probably mostly less than mediocre comedy, which is really what this film tries to be in the end. The fight scenes, the car chases... all mediocre. I've always found McCarthy at her best when she plays a strong, aggressive, let-it-rip kinda gal, and when those moments come in this film, she was truly hilarious. Sadly that persona doesn't show up until past the midway point of the film, and worse, she does it only sporadically through the rest of the flick. As a result, only sporadic laughs the rest of the film. And only making it worse, I couldn't stop thinking about how large she is (ya, I'm going there). She's uncomfortably large, and it distracts sometimes, kind of the way it use to affect me when I watched John Candy on film. When an actor gets that large, it really affects your ability to buy into the notion that she's a CIA operative and that she could do anything that she's shown doing on the screen. The rest of the cast was mostly solid. Jude Law was his usual charismatic self, and Rose Byrne was a hot as ever, but neither were given characters worthy of their talents. Even Allison Janney wisely chose to go uncredited (ok, I don't know that she chose that but if I were her, I would). Unfortunately, this is a meh film with comedy that mostly falls flat.",Spy

It might not sound like a good commercial, but it is... just like Dumb and Dumber and Mr. Bean is packed with stupid jokes, so is Spy from 2015. But, I like that kind of humor, and as a result, this movie is 100% enjoyable and a movie I am able to watch over and over again.Jason Statham is incredible in his role as a stupid agent that does everything wrong, and Melissa McCarthy is perfect for the role as an undercover agent who really is an analyst with little experience in the field!All in all, this is a movie that will make you laugh hard, especially if you like such sort of humor and if you are a bit tired!",Spy

334,crazyhorsefc,A comedy with not many jokes but a lot of profanity,2,23 July 2018,"The problem with this film is that both the star and director made it under the misapprehension that swearing a lot is funny by itself so have therefore seemingly dispensed with putting any effort in when it comes to actually constructing comedic scenes and delivering punchlines. Relying on famous faces saying ""fuck"" every five seconds loses any impact quite quickly and stops being funny soon after. That said, Jason Statham sends his hard man persona up quite nicely and the film picks up whenever his on screen but its little and far between.The film is also extremely violent for a comedy - with several minor characters suffering quite horrendous wounds and deaths in the ""name of fun"". Having a character suffer multiple gun shot wounds, stabbing a woman in the hand and having a man have his throat melt after drinking acid may be funny to director Paul Feig but he doesn't have the skill nor the competence to handle ""Tom & Jerry"" violence and misjudges the tone of the film completely. Is someone throwing up on a dead man really the height of comedy?Finally, their is an underlying tone of racism (offensive Italian stereotypes, racist language etc) throughout that arguably leaves a worst taste in the mouth than the aforementioned acid.",Spy

Yes, there's swearing, violence, and a briefly cringe-worthy vomit scene, but honestly, they all work within the scenes and add to the movie. It also had a nice blend of both male and female actors, which is very refreshing to see in an action movie. There were a few times I would have preferred an alternate take (Susan enjoying the cat-callers, Aldo's unwanted advances, even Nancy's forceful attempts to kiss 50 Cent) but overall the majority of the movie feels competent and strong.

Great fun outside of Aldo...when you throw him in, it's a laugh ride minute. The CiA Agent in the ear was a great device that started out as a gag but ended up being a very useful tool. I love it and when they turned it on Melissa-I was in heaven. Nice use of the Spy Genre. A little Rom-com( maybe), a little action ( yep except scratch a little), no major explosions, fast car chases, or other usual devices. This was Melissa playing against type and Jason playing against type and Aldo playing all types with a nuclear weapon thrown in just for giggles . By the way-fight scene with the knife and frying pan-GENIUS! Uber-Genius! What a great fight scene! It was wonderful. BRAVO!!!! I loved it and went back to review it again and again. Who told Melissa that she could fight? I hope that she asked for it! I know that I would have. I love movies like this and want to see Ms. Change of Identiies 😳 do more globe trotting like Mr.bean (I'm sorry- Johnny English). Can we hook her up with Maxwell Smart, The Rock, and Johnny English?

Beneath the violence and the swears, I wanted to find a FUNNY movie, but the shallow story, bland characters pull down Spy's pants, one those it can't pull up in its runtime. Melissa McCarthy is brilliantly gut punchingly awesome as Susan Cooper, an overweight, but badass spy. All the others- Jude Law, Jason ""Transporter"" Statham and Rose Byrne, give good performances to hold up the movie. Director Paul Feig's previous flick, Bridesmades, had better use of the comedy and themes it held. Byrne's finicky villain, is good but she wants to be a good one than a bad villain. Jude Law breaks his luck, by giving a solid performance. Transporter Statham gives an unusually good act. Overall, Paul Feig's crooked direction, the hammy story and twists pull down this film from its potential.

341,debramorey52,Entertaining movie with an outstanding supporting cast,7,18 July 2015,"I haven't seen many of Melissa McCarthy's recent movies because I found the couple I had seen to be disappointing. They were comedies, she was in them, they seemed to have the same plot (overweight, unattractive woman surprises everyone by her chutzpah, etc.).I did enjoy this movie, the first new light comedy I'd seen in a long time. (I mostly watch older movies.)I felt Miss McCarthy's role could have been played by any competent actress, most of her scenes involved action which were done by stunt people, so it didn't matter that it was her. Again, this was a case of trying to cash in on her popularity as an overweight comedienne. (She has lost weight recently and looks very nice; wonder how that will affect her career?)She played the Sookie St. James character so well on Gilmore Girls, I don't want to give the idea that I dislike her, I don't. I just think she's riding a wave of popularity and I wish she had better material to work with to show her 'stuff.'BUT having said that, I must say what really sells the movie and holds it up is the supporting cast! Brilliant choice of casting, every actor was great and believable and made the movie entertaining. I looked ever one up on IMDb to learn if I'd seen them previously and to learn or re-learn their names. Jason Statham was gorgeous as always and quite funny throughout. I have heard this might become a franchise and I would certainly watch a second just to see this cast.My recommendation would be to watch it for pure entertainment and an enjoyable couple of hours!",Spy

If I wanted to watch a fantasy I would watch Lord of the Rings or watch the Star War's movies but to see an obviously overweight woman be disgusted to sleep with Jason Statham and gets whistled at for wearing a new dress. Then when I saw that she learned to fly a jet in 15 seconds and she memorized a map of Italy that she never looked at, made me go crazy. The plot twist was great even though it technically was not a twist what so ever. The character build up was smooth except they forgot to show us where Mrs. Cooper got her superhuman abilities.

She was just not very funny nor was her acting any good. But I must say I laughed at this a few times.Normally I might smile a few times or chuckle once or twice in maybe 20 out of 100 comedies now a days. I might laugh once if i'm lucky in maybe 5-6 out of 100. But I think i laughed like 3 times in this one. That's rather rare so for me the movie was good.It was a bit on the violent side and a LOT of crude adult humor. But it worked. McCarthy did a fine job acting in it. She did not have those lines that she is TRYING to pull off & make funny. She owned them.I also enjoyed what they did with Jason S. character that was unexpected for our big action hero in a spy movie.Also it was nice to see Morena Baccarin, our favorite space concubine (firefly) even if it was a small part.All in all it was well made, well acted but maybe a bitviolent and raunchy but it worked for me.

Jason Statham was incredibly entertaining, the movie exaggerated many social taboos and oddities we experience every day, we all feel the same but dare not say it aloud, this movie says a lot of our inner thoughts aloud.

The director is WAY more intelligent than to just want to make a James Bond spoof. This is a breath of fresh air for people who are sick of films that serve male tastes and interests. The feminist jokes go further than the absolutely brilliant lead played by Melissa McCarthy with concomitant jokes about her being a very unlikely cool and genius successful spy for British Intelligence. There's the whole angle of her male companion who is at a loose end and trying to get in on her mission, who can't help boasting about what he's achieved in the past. Jumping from high buildings using his jacket as a parachute for example -and then she later shows him up and completely dumbfounds him with a line about how he might have two as his gun's protruding from his back pocket. His face, as he's dumbstruck by this idea, is priceless. Frankly, I'm dumbstruck by the brilliance of everyone who made this film. The Timing is everything in Comedy, right? Well, by some sleight of hand they've managed to make an absolute symphony of action and jokes. I don't know how they did it and I'm so impressed that I reckon I'll remember this film forever.

But it's a movie I can set aside my cynical doubts long enough to have a laugh but unfortunately there are not many in this movie. Melissa McCarthy gives it an admirable try, I can't really fault her she just needed better material. Jude Law was pretty respectable too.Jason Statham was just horrible, not funny at all, and he felt tacked on at the end, like they made the movie, decided it needed more something, and added him in. That's not really what happened, Statham was involved since shooting started, but that's how it felt anyways.By the end it just drags on.

The scene stealer was 100% Jason Statham who's macho ""better than you"" attitude made me crack up every time.My Favorite line was delivered by Melissa McCarthy after her initial spy character reveal.

It was surprisingly funny, my husband laughed more than I did, but the humor was mostly decent- some very low brow stuff like Bridesmaids but a few quotable lines. Jude Law's accent was a bit odd but all the principals turned in solid performances. It may have been written as a spoof on James Bond, but it comes off better as a riff on American spy movies ala Mission Impossible and the Bourne series. (The better Bond spoof of the year definitely goes to Kingsmen.) It had some interesting plot twists and turns to keep you following and I didn't see the main twist from a mile away as I tend to, so that was nice. The supporting cast at the CIA were especially great and I probably laughed at those bits the most.",Spy

After about 80 minutes (running time is 2 hours), the movie devolves into a tedium of fight scenes, car chases, and uninspired foul language. The fight scenes are excessively dubbed for comedic value (will audiences never tire of the knee-to-the-groin-with-a-crunching-sound gag?!) but there really isn't a lower level of humor than that.Also, the blatant product placement for BMW is obnoxious. (And what ""50 Cent"" is doing in the movie is anybody's guess.)

F words are everywhere nowadays, used as common language, unfortunately. So, maybe I am jaded about organs and F words but neither bothered me in this movie.

In fact, Lucy is still making people laugh. It doesn't matter how old you are or how long ago Lucy was on the air, you tend to like Lucy if you have a sense of humor.Not so with McCarthy. I like to think I have a great sense of humor... and while I like Mike and Molly, I tend to not like her movies. I find her much more funny in Mike and Molly where she has to be more reeled in because of the FCC standards on network television.This movie was one or two big laughs, mixed with a few smaller chuckles among a bunch of - seriously? moments. Some of the attempts at laughs were unnecessary... like the big penis selfie... it was not only NOT funny, it added nothing to the moment, and was there for the cheap, and quite forced laugh. The audience, when I saw the movie, seemed uncomfortable and weren't quite sure if they were suppose to laugh or not. When you fall to cheap laughs - it's because the writing/acting isn't strong enough on it's own.And you know you may be dropping the ""F-bomb"" too often, when you have 50 cent doing a cameo and he's the only one with a clean mouth. You also know the movie is in trouble when side characters who pop in and out on occasion to drop a joke, (like the ones played by Statham and Law), are funnier than the leading character. I actually anticipated the moments Statham would appear. I also enjoyed Law's character.I'd say it's funny enough to see - but you will not want to own this one on DVD or really feel like seeing it again (say, for example, you have a friend who hasn't seen it and wants you to come along). You'll probably politely decline and say, ""Saw it already. once was enough."" I give it a C/C+.If they'd have dropped a few more jokes instead of F-bombs...

A lot of reviews here of this movie seem to be confused- of course it's got sex and violence. It's a Bond tribute! That's kind of inherent to the genre. If you're bothered by those things, don't watch it. Also it's R rated! It's not the movie's fault if you're too stupid to realize that means not to bring your kids.

But in the end the ridiculous bathroom humor won and two of my movie companions left the room half way through and the other one picked up his computer to watch YouTube videos...and while the ending was cute it wasn't redeeming enough for me to be glad I had stayed.

The casting was perfect and the comedy was crass, but a fun (albeit bloody and violent) movie that was worth seeing. It was edgy and definitely warranted the R rating, but it wasn't over the top gross. It was clever and funny enough to balance it out. Statham was out of his environment in a comedy and I felt he was trying too hard, but it worked out overall. MacCarthy is always a hoot and does a fantastic job of playing the overweight, homely administrative side kick of the dashing James Bond type, Jude Law. There were the typical 'fat' jokes and some got a little repetitive, but most of the comedy drew loud responses from the audience, and I found myself even giggling out loud at some of the more benign gags. Byrne was gorgeous, and I think I saw her trying her best not to crack up at times, playing her role as a nasty, rich bitch criminal involved in hooking up some really bad guys with a nuclear device. It was a mish mash of comedy, slap stick, violence, murder, and espionage. A lot of fun with a twist. Stay for the very end after initial credits.",Spy

All the jokes were hilarious, Melissa's delivery was on point with every 'character' she played and Rose Byrne as the villain was just perfect. You'd think I'm a little biased as I love these women so much, but it was amazing to see the whole room laughing so loud at each joke, we had people crying from laughter throughout the whole movie and it was just an amazing experience overall, felt like an incredible therapy session. I'd advise everyone to see this movie in groups, it is an amazing experience to share with other people, as it also provides a lot of content for 'inside jokes'.

She openly embraces her full figure and has no problem making light of it in her films. The stereotypes around plus size, mid-aged, single women are alive and then shot down by Mccarthy (No pun intended). A-list supporting actors do their part in sharing the laughs.

Think James Bond spoof. I wondered if I was displaying ""bad parent"" behaviour by showing them a movie that clearly expressed there was violence, swearing and nudity in it. In my eyes the humour factor far outweighed the above. We all thought it was very funny and the one liners throughout the movie are well placed; more along the lines of an English comedy. It's silly and fun and will make you laugh. Yes their is violence but can we call it ""ridiculous unbelievable violence""? that can't be taken seriously; nudity; a nano second of an appendage or two; loads of the ""f"" word and reverence to body parts. Yes it probably was a little South of the cartoon South Park and Family Guy but if you're open minded and accepting that the kids hear all this in the schoolyard, go and have a laugh.

Not sure which was better: Melissa McCarthy playing an action hero or Jason Stratham doing comedy. Summary: Melissa McCarthy is a back office CIA agent providing Intel for an agent in the field. A mission goes wrong and it appears the bad guy knows the names and descriptions of all the field agents. So while the Agency is trying to figure out who they can send to shadow the baddie, Melissa volunteers to go since no one has ever seen her or even know her name. After that, the comedy really begins with Stratham getting in the way, double agents and even a surprise one. Excellent performances by everyone in it.

390,MattTheNoble,Not the feminist comedy people say,6,14 June 2015,"Imagine an Austin Powers movie mixed in with Get Smart, Johnny English, and 22 Jump Street Starring a woman and you have Melissa McCarthy's newest flick, Spy. Spy follows a bumbling wannabe CIA special agent as she bounces around exotic European locales to stop evil masterminds from selling WMDs. Like you might imagine, there is not a great deal of groundbreaking dialogue or acting in the film, but there is something unique about it and I want to take a moment to examine that. This year seems to be the year of women at the box office. Some of the largest grossing films of 2015 have female leads such as Cinderella, Pitch Perfect, and Mad Max. Add Spy to that list. It is almost certain to gross over $30 million this opening weekend and may even do better with all the positive critical reviews. Like those other films led by ladies, some are saying Spy has a certain feminist bent. It looks at men and makes fun of those who patronize our leading lady, and rightfully so, as she proves herself more than competent, despite things other than her gender getting in the way of her success. McCarthy creates a strong character and is pretty funny most of the time. The supporting actors likewise are good and Jason Statham is legitimately enjoyable as a competing international sleuth. That makes this movie similar to the others I mentioned above. There is, however, one major difference between those above and Spy: Spy still depicts women as dumb, socially unaware, and desperately dependent for a man's affirmation. Granted, some might argue that Cinderella and Pitch Perfect lean that direction also, but there seems to be a distinct difference between how these movies depict women. Cinderella, for one, comes from classic material and though the character falls for the prince and wishes for his affection, the ultimate conflict arises between her and her evil step-family who are the one truly willing to stoop to any level to achieve notoriety with the patriarch. Pitch Perfect likewise is about breaking into an international scene and the struggle of a small unknown group taking on the favorites for the world championship. Additionally, Pitch Perfect is about sisterhood and not letting the end of something like college be the end of friendship. Contrast that with Spy where McCarthy's homely Susan Cooper, a handler at the CIA, falls in love with her special agent played by Jude Law. So great is her dedication, that his death convinces her to do something that never would have done for herself, despite the calling of her childhood dreams. It's the man that gets her to pursue the field once again. And right when you think the movie has chosen to end with the leading lady not falling for the guy but choosing to accompany her best friend on the next adventure, the credits sequence reveals differently as she wakes up next to a supporting male character, undercutting any credibility the movie had for building strong, independent female characters. So, what gives? I want to say I can easily enjoy a movie with a female lead if she is written well. Furiosa from Mad Max, for example, is probably the most compelling character I've seen on screen all year. Granted, genre does change things, and spy is a situation comedy. But is it possible to write a strong, confident female lead without undermining her credibility? I think so. Above, I said Spy reminded me of things like Austin Powers and Get Smart, both of which have leads who are continually undermined by their own ineptness. But those male characters are never doing all of their heroic actions for the sake of some woman they lost. In fact, some of them discard their lady sidekicks for laughs or somehow also manage to woo another lady and defeat the bad guy in one simultaneous action. While we do see Susan Cooper take out the villain in Spy, she does also get rejected by the man she likes, do her best to stop the villain only to be told she was the most obvious undercover agent in history, only to have it all topped off with bedroom scene where she it's implied she has slept with one of the male characters who treated her most poorly. Cinderella sounds great after that. I didn't hate Spy, but I didn't love it and I definitely think it's an exaggeration to say this movie is a feminist version of other spy films. I think it might be as good as we get for a situation comedy, but it's still a bit disappointing and offensive. Actually, let me talk about that for a second. I usually won't complain too much about content in films, as I see a lot of films with dark or questionable content, but Spy was especially disgusting. It did not pull any punches with a hard R rating and uses every four letter word you can think of and on top of it all, shows the audience two pictures of fully erect penises. I didn't see either of those moments coming and they were at least five to ten seconds each. Not something I thought I'd see that evening. Overall, Spy is funny and will likely do well at the box office, but it's not feminist and it's not something I'll likely watch again.",Spy
391,IoreksDaemon,Melissa McCarthy's Best Movie Yet,8,6 June 2015,"I have just returned from seeing this movie on opening night in the cinema and it's the first time in years that I have been in a theater where the entire audience was laughing almost constantly from start to finish. I had seen the trailers for this movie beforehand and was skeptical as to whether the full movie would live up to them. I was worried all the funny bits were used for promotion of the movie (which happens so often with comedies) but that wasn't the case with this one.The cast were incredible together. I have seen a lot of Melissa McCarthy's movies and lately she has had a few that were nothing special (Tammy, Identity Thief) which made me wonder if she had used up all of her comedic value by overplaying the same type of characters for the sake of being in a movie. In this film she has showed diversity with her character and has proved that she hasn't lost her touch when it comes to comedy. Rose Byrne, Miranda Hart and Jason Statham all provided incredibly funny characters. In particular, Byrne and McCarthy's back-and-forth insults had everyone laughing.Paul Feig's script is exceptional. I often find when one person writes and directs a movie it just doesn't work or the storyline ends up very one-sided but Feig has made a genuinely funny movie with a great story and fantastic direction.

The script takes stereo-types such as: arrogant hot- shot secret agents, mysterious beauties, lonely cat lady, and mousy secretary, and displays them all for us to see in a most hilarious light. It's refreshing in that it comments on the inner strength within us -- as shown by the insecure eager to please character, Susan Cooper. Each performer is compelling. Susan's too-tall side kick and best friend is a perfect match--they remain vulnerable and smart as they bumble their way through social scenes and finesse their way to success.

Yielding the full power of the United States Military Industrial Complex at her fingertips she is able to pull off numerous surprises to keep her agent alive in the field. However, Fine's luck will eventually run out when he enters a home where the CIA's best technology is snarled and inoperative. Bradley Fine is taken out of commission by Raina Boyanov (Rose Byrne) an aristocratic arms dealer with a flair for extravagance. Raina rambles off the names of the CIA's top agents and warns them to back-off. The stakes are extremely high because the agency is trying to recover a mobile nuclear device before it is sold into the hands of a terrorist organization that plan to set if off in New York City. This is when Susan Cooper will volunteer to become a field agent. The CIA director Elaine Crocker (Allison Janney) is reluctant but after viewing Susan's training videos from a decade before, she decides to give the operation a green light. However, Rick Ford (Jason Statham, the unlikely comic relief) is adamantly opposed to sending a woman into the field, especially a desk jockey. Rick Ford will continue throughout the film to essentially fill the role of a fool, however surprising for this is well-known action star. The CIA sends Susan to her first assignment in Paris, where the plot quickly thickens and things do not unravel as planned. It is not long before Susan is posing as Raina's personal body guard (actually saving her life multiple times from various assassins). While in Rome the CIA pairs Susan with a reckless sleazy Italian agent, Peter Serafinowicz, who continually attempts to steal a kiss, but does not succeed. While in Rome the CIA also sends Nancy (Miranda Hart) another CIA desk assistant into the field to assist Susan. While in a nightclub to prevent from having her cover blown, Susan asks Nancy to create a diversion so Susan can prevent a meeting between an unnamed female beauty (Nargis Fakhri) and Raina. Nancy's diversion consists of an altercation with the rapper 50 Cent while he is performing on the stage. Meanwhile Susan battles the assassin Nargis Fakhri in the kitchen with knives, pans, and persistence. Shortly after this we find ourselves in Eastern Europe where all the surviving characters and a few others appear for one final showdown. Susan will once again prove herself a super-spy with some amazing gymnastics reminiscent of Kingsmen (a recent film that lacks a woman's perspective and went over the top with an eccentric plot).

Suspend your Another-Melissa-being-funny-fat- girl-movie snobbery, because she blew mine right out of the theatre after my friend dragged me to this. My friend has cancer, no longer likes seeing serious movies, and so I put away my I-watch-foreign-contemplative-films persona and let my diet coke spurt out of my nose. I loved so many parts of this movie. Melissa, despite some foul and crude jokes, was brilliant, human, super human, silly, touching. Jason Stratham made me do a 180. It's not a perfect movie but who needs that more than they need 2hours of giggles and enjoyment? Great story.

I was shocked because the serious actors that we knew in other movies, is very funny. The movie is probably not the most funny film, but it is entertaining throughout the movie.There is violence, comedy and action. The setting is great, camera angles are fine, lighting is good, and acting is a bit weird for some but it's still okay. If you had a bad day, I recommend watching this movie for good vibes.

404,yukinokourei,Hilarious,6,24 September 2015,"I've been curious about this film for the past 2 months and I half regretted when I watched it.The film itself is full of humors and maybe some dirty jokes, action-packed (perhaps... but I don't think so). Sadly, I am disappointed by how the film turns out. Rick Ford (Jason Statham) has small portion of appearance than I expected, he was a interesting character yet he doesn't appeared much like, he's no more than a cameo playing for a long time (in my view) while I feel that Susan Copper (Melissa McCarthy) was too prominent, she almost had whole film as her own (I know that she is the main character but still... too much) other interesting characters become ""shadows"" becoming less noticed. Rayna Boyanov (Rose Byrne) has a quite interesting background but sadly there's only a little to know. Another thing for the reason I'm disappointed of is the character development, there's no much to see from the other characters (especially their background- gosh, I really want to know more about other characters) other than Susan herself, which have a quite great improvement.Overall, I enjoyed this film and laughed so hard at the jokes and some silly scene. Highly recommended for those who need some hilarious packed with funny action scene film to watch. P.S : (For me) I think this film need parental guidance since there are some scenes that are unsuitable for children under age 17 (or so) to watch (since some scenes are explicit and some inappropriate scenes) more like, this film is more suit for adults :)",Spy

It is one of those movies that, you know what will happen next, before it does. I usually enjoy Melissa McCarthy, but even she couldn't make this a watchable movie. Somewhere after the exposed penis shots (and convex lens tricks(I mean is this supposed to be soft porn??)) I fell asleep from boredom, but only wish I could have fell asleep sooner. No, I wish I had saved my money. This happens to be the worst movie I have watched this year, from it's plot less script to its cheap -throw in naked bodies- shots, I cannot see anyone rating it as a must see.

The cover photo almost put me off, looking as if it represents an atypical silly spoof 80's style US comedy (I'm not a one who like mush US comedy movies) . Top marks all round, action scenes, the well-acted characters are easy to engage with, storyline although stretched has an old style bond kind of narrative to it, and the comedy is top notch. Statham is brilliant in his portrait of the overzealous spy almost gone bad. It's never going to tax the mind or engage on subliminal levels, but it's a good old romp that I'll watch again.

Sometimes there's a long dry spell between good movies to see and we made the right choice to go to this one. Thankfully there are folks doing the hard work that it takes to make funny movies like this. I didn't think too much about what to expect and was very pleased.

I was pleasantly surprised on several fronts. From a comedic standpoint this movie had plenty of laugh out loud moments. From unexpected jokes to cliched jokes done well enough that they were still funny. To some degree I felt the movie was laughing at itself and pulled this off. Less astute viewers might miss this and feel that the movie is using them for the sake of trying to be clever but in my opinion that was an element of its brilliance.
From an acting point of view I felt that Melissa McCarthy and Miranda Hart delivered the best performances of any movie that I have seen them in and felt they worked well together. Also notable was Jessica Chaffin and Jason Statham.
As for the script I felt it moved the story along nicely. A great balance of comedy, action and drama well paced through out the movie. 
This movie was beautiful to watch in HD with some lovely locations and sets which added to my overall enjoyment. This is a movie I will enjoy watching again one day and would risk watching a sequel should they ever make one.",Spy

The rest of the film deserves a -5 stars for the potty humor constantly throughout the film along with not a single character having the ability to string together 3 words without inserting the f-bomb at least once. Some sentences are nothing but low language. This film had genuine potential. Melissa McCarthy really shone in the action sequences, a number of which I thought were truly funny, but then she spoke again. *sigh* And the penis, sex and fart ""jokes"" detracted even more. Remake this film as a true James Bond spoof with the witty dialog you see in those films and it could be a true winner.

Either that or they've had a sense of humour bypass. I saw Spy in the cinema when it first came out and I haven't laughed so hard at a film in years. I have since seen it three or four times and still find it hilarious.Some seem to have missed that it's a spoof, it's not trying to be Bond, Bourne or even Kingsman, it's taking the familiar tropes and turning them upside down to comedic effect. The cast are all excellent, with particular praise for Jason Statham and Peter Serafinowicz as a hard man spy who's really an idiot, and an Italian lothario agent, respectively. Statham's willingness to send himself up mercilessly is just brilliant. This is first and foremost a very funny comedy, but it also works as an action movie. The action sequences and stunts are well done and exciting and would not be out of place in a straight spy film.Basically, don't believe the 1 star reviews. It's not Shakespeare, it's not trying to be, but it is a consistently funny spoof and well worth a view if you're looking for a bit of escapism.",Spy

419,iwasmefirst,Actually pretty good,7,16 November 2015,"Lately Melissa Mccarthy has just done a string of films in which she plays varying caricatures of Melissa McCarthy. I watched The Heat but regretted it, and couldn't even face Tammy or Identity Thief. However I decided to give this a go and didn't regret it. Melissa's character of a CIA 'agent' who's only ever been in the basement, directing the real spy's over their radios is surprisingly competent when called to the field. The obvious similarity may be 'Jonny English', but far from a dimwitted spy who stumbles into the right place Melissa's Susan Cooper is actually very competent, but plagued by bad luck throughout her mission. She saves the day, not by being ridiculous and lucky, but by actually being a good agent, who's also got years of intel from being the one directing the agents for so long. Another surprise is Jason Statham, who has also only ever played, in varying degrees, Jason Statham. While he does still play Jason Statham the CIA Agent (no accent, thankfully!), he plays the comedic foil to Melissa better than expected. He's over the top and actually funny.So overall, a lot better than I was expecting, and in fact I think a lot better than any commercials I've seen for it (which all tend to focus on Melissa in stupid disguises). It's not Oscar worthy but it's good fun, and I personally felt not as over the top as some might have you believe.",Spy

Seriously, there was not a scene where i didn't laugh, yes some of the humour is bathroom humour or physical but that doesn't mean its not funny. Jason Statham stole the show for me, he was absolutely hilarious and the recipient of many laughs. I saw this with my friends, all 20 year olds, in a packed cinema with people of all ages really, or 15 and up, and everyone was laughing, i think its a movie that no matter your taste in humour you will at least chuckle. A friend of mine wasn't too keen on seeing this movie as he felt Melissa McCarthy wasn't funny but he laughed so much and at the end of the film he thanked us for making him come and see it as he thoroughly enjoyed it.

It does not know what it wants to be. A comedy or an action movie. And even when it does pick one of those genres it doesn't know what kind of comedy it wants to be. Toilet humor and language more salty than south park or a slapstick PG movie where the main character pratfalls all over the place.Another major point of inconsistency are the main character's abilities. Are they super spies or bumbling buffoons? It is impossible to tell and they switch from moment to moment sometimes more than once in a minute's time.Watch Johnny English or The Man Who Knew too Little for FAR better examples of this type of comedic spy movie.,Spy

It is a comedy and hilarious. If people can't understand why this has over a 7 rating then those people all have a terrible sense of humor as funny is funny and no amount of cursing or other offensive things will take away the funny.If you have a sense of humor at all and aren't easily offended then you will die laughing at this movie regardless of your age or sex.

I guess the idea is that she couldn't think of anything else better to do and was pretending this was her ""persona"", but at the same time it felt odd and pushed and like it was only chosen as her persona because the director couldn't think of anything better to do either. If nothing else the insults were just too forced and too far. But otherwise I found it surprisingly good and it wasn't just another one of her ""fat girl female-version-of Zach-Galifianakis-comedies"". Of course, it had a lot of her classic type cast laughs, but she managed to do something different enough that you didn't feel like you were just watching another movie with her as the 'fat weirdo sidekick'.

Those are guaranteed to make you laugh, but this movie just makes you wanna gouge your eyes out. This is a movie that never should have been made.And what is wrong with Jason Statham? Did he have to keep his balls stored away in a pickle jar, for the entire duration the movie was shot? (To be very feminine, if you don't get what I mean) Whatever the money he got out from this movie wasn't worth flushing his career down the drain.Since when did gigantic prosthetic dicks become a regular comedy theme? I don't see any giant prosthetic female genitals on screen as a joke!! Bloody double standard. Damn you Hollywood.The movie Titanic has only 7.7 and this has 7.1? What the bloody hell?

I have to say that I like raw comedies, but it seems the train went out of tracks since ""National Lampoon's Animal House"" arrived.

There are ways to make a script sound more natural which don't require an abuse of swear words. And I say 'abuse', not 'use', because I understand their value. They are restricted on TV for some reason, but there is no need to overcompensate for that. Honestly. And the need to show a fully erect phallus is...? Also, being European myself I can't but feel sorry for Italian men. I feel like the actors did the best they could to salvage the material they hard to work with. Don't mistake me, there are some gems hidden between the limping dialogue and the movie started out very promisingly. Melissa shines with her own light, Statham proved to be funny at times and Jude Law delivered. Rose Byrne did a decent job too, but her interactions with the main character were just cheap. Are you unable to create tension between two female figures without bitchy comments? I feel disappointed that this project did not live up to its potential. It could have been so much better... Well, it happened with Bridesmaids too, in my opinion. Give Kristen, Melissa, Kate and Leslie good material for Ghostbusters, for the love of big G (if there is one out there). Mind your language and please be clever, as you sometimes prove to be. If you ruin this one for me, the same as you've been doing with your ""adult"" comedy, I'll never forgive nor forget.

In Bulgarian language, family names of females and males are created as following: For females: Rayna Boyanova (ends always on ""a"") For males: Chris Boyanov (ends on ""v"") In the movie the name of the female mafia character was Rayna Boyanov which is common for Russian and ex-soviet counties. Bulgaria however is not Russia. Also the comment of Rayna about Bulgaria being a horrible place full with homeless people is a little bit out of the line.

An unlikely choice for fieldwork, she travels around Europe following suspected arms dealer Rayna Boyanov (Rose Byrne) as rogue agent Rick Ford (Jason Statham) attempts to interrupt her mission in order to show the agency that he is their most indispensable agent.The movie combines comedy and action seamlessly. Statham's comedic timing and unapologetic quips work well with his classic action star stunts. McCarthy, on the other hand, showed versatility as she embodied different person as that ranged from being Susan the pushover to ruthless spy Amber Valentine.

At most there's the reoccurring joke that her cover identities are all like frumpy cat women, which is typical of the average woman regardless of weight (True Lies ""Natasha?"", ""No no Doris"" comes to mind).If anything it was refreshing to see a character who is physically average kicking butt! The scene with the footage from ""the farm"" was funny, I even hit rewind a few times! The language from Mccarthy was much more tame than usual, and sorry but I laughed out loud at the thunder c**t line! The vomit ""not on him, not on him"" Hilarious! And I loved seeing Maccarthy dressed up nice! WHY NOT!?Yes during the action sequences you saw her shoes clearly switching from heels, to flats, to wedgies, back to heels! Very sloppy but actually I didn't mind! If anything it allowed me to have that geek moment of noticing the flaws! However blatant! Spy won't change the world (did you expect it to??) but speaking on behalf of, at least some portion of the overweight female viewing world: It's like fat fantasy porn. A guilty pleasure if you will! Men have been doing it with Bond for years!!! (In my opinion Bond is only credible in the Daniel Craig years, but that's another story!) So two thumbs up for us fatties! Where else do you see the average female turning it around with her unrequited love only to say SEE YA! And ends up in bed with Jason Statham!? (A fact she is not happy about!) Also, I'm not a fan of Statham but at least he's trying something different!I agree with (someones) comment that the first 15 minutes show how it could have been taken in a totally different direction (cooler, no doubt) and yes i'd have been TOTALLY up for that!! But feeling disappointed by a movie is nothing new really, is it??? There's enough crud in this world for me to say, if they made a sequel i'd totally see it!! :DI didn't get offended by the d**k pic at all, but if you did then avoid 'The Brothers Grimsby' at all costs! Now I did think that was crudely unfunny. And a lot of the ""this is so crude and unfunny"" comments allotted to Spy, you can apply to 'Grimsby'. I think the majority of chunky women will have a special place for this movie, and there's enough of them in the world! And this is rarely shown in film, on that merit alone I could have given it a 10! In fact I think the average female (if not male) should probably relate to the content regardless of being fat or thin. The fact that she's overweight just really cements the average-Joe angle. (The most unbelievable bit was running to the top of spiral staircase! LOL there was no way I was buying that!) I am a fan of this type of movie (action/spy), and so I see where some may be disappointed, but you can always have Kingsman on standby!",Spy

The beginning was actually not bad so my expectations were that it should be at list somewhat entertaining, but the next 95% of the movie proved me wrong...The plot is extremely generic and without any creative expression at all. Most of the scenes are boring at best and really cringy and obnoxious, the jokes are either sexual or plain cursing and insults but not in a funny way at all. Only a couple of scenes gave me a degree of entertainment (when Rick Ford brags about himself and when the security guy Anthony gets shot, maybe something else) all of the rest was making it difficult to watch... The characters were boring as well. The action is not top notch but its alright, but it doesn't even come close to making up for the rest. The production itself is good but it would be a crime if it wasn't with a 65 million budget.In conclusion: There was potential to this movie but they flushed it in the sewer where the level of the movie is as well...

I would almost say, intellectually, it was ""True Lies"" for Disney XD. And therein lies my confusion: with the F-Bombs in triple digits, and other profanity as prolific, you push the film to an R rating. Who was their target audience? The Freshmen class at Retarded U?By cleaning up the script and cutting, or at least sanitizing, just a few scenes; this could have easily been a PG-13 film drawing parents, as well as their kids. Not only that, it likely would have been much funnier.I hope the writers and producers, as well as the director, of this film starve. Their poor choices certainly should not be rewarded.

454,ssvishs,"Surprisingly fresh not a cliché, laugh out loud funny",9,11 June 2015,"I honestly did not expect to laugh this much at a Hollywood blockbuster comedy. The trailers for this film did not actually do it justice. I watched it because of Melissa McCarthy's good resume. McCarthy's improvisations during the film are as always hilarious and satisfying. I did not expect her to be this good in action and fight scenes though! I was on the fence about Jason Statham in a comedy, since he can only do one character, but his character was used skillfully to create most unexpected exploding laughs. His monologues are also very funny, especially the first one, although after a while they get shorter and also lose a little of their funny juice. the last ten minutes was a bit too cheesy for my taste, but it was saved by the last joke and I left the movie theater feeling refreshed. There was only one cliché over the top character, but it didn't bother me much, because the jokes were there and boy were they funny! The love story was kind of related to the plot, but the movie could have been even better without it, it feels a bit forced, since Jude Law is just not made for comedy. One of the things that really stood out for me, which I had not seen used well in many movies before, was the use of really brutal, violent, and even disgusting scenes for comedy. The result in most movies is just a sick feeling in your stomach, while cursing the writer who thought vomit or gore itself are funny enough no matter the context. But the movie has some great jokes right after or even during some of the most brutal scenes which otherwise would've been sickening. Overall, this is certainly the best blockbuster comedy of the year; and it is actually worth the ticket price, because you will laugh constantly. Good writing, good directing, and funny actors. I saw old people, young people, teenagers, couples, all laughing hard and constantly with me during the movie.",Spy

The second half of the movie got a little long and the end was a little disappointing. I still enjoyed it and laughed.

And if you are insulted by cursing then watch one of the thousands of other movies available to you instead of down voting an R rated movie for having swear words in it.That aside I thought the movie was very very funny.

I enjoyed the arc of McCarthy's character moving from smart but lacking in confidence back office worker to kick ass spy.

Melissa McCarthy is the most entertaining comic actress working today and she's in fine form.One aspect most people probably don't think about is the propaganda. Like much of Hollywood (especially TV dramas these days), this movie is big time propaganda. It's a feel good story for the disgusting CIA. It also reinforces the fraudulent idea of terrorism (all of which is state created). Furthermore, it conditions us to the idea of a nuke in a briefcase, and places the blame on rogue terrorists.

The chemistry of the cast was perfect and I hated it when the movie finally ended. Luckily, they actually set it up for a sequel which I hope comes relatively quick since great comedies are hard to come by lately.If you're going to let your kids watch the film just be warned that Melissa McCarthy uses some pretty colorful language from time-to-time but it really isn't anything kids don't hear at school and among their friends I am sure. Jason Statham was a pretty intense and funny field operative and I can honestly say that his character really added the perfect balance to the overall story. As far as Jude Law is concerned, I have only two words, ""James Bond"".

The jokes come fast and mostly hit the target. The supporting cast were superb, especially Statham who sends up not just every character he has played since snatch but basically every bad ass macho man we have seen since the 80's.The weakest part of the movie is the actual espionage element of the story with some flip flopping in the final 3rd that didn't make much sense other than to move the story along, but at that point I was laughing so much I didn't really care.While in the past McCarthy has shown herself to be a very funny comedian she can often miss the mark as much as she hits it, but with Spy I feel she has been really allowed to shine. Maybe it's because her comedic style is so abrasive that it worked for her in Spy, as we first meet her as a put upon office worker who is contently overlooked and then when she finally gets to unleashes on everyone its great fun to see and to root for her.I'd really recommend this movie for anyone looking for a good laugh... and who doesn't like to laugh!!",Spy

The 'I'm so fat and ugly, watch me fall over and swear' act is getting old. Nothing you do in this movie is funny or interesting.Spy is a movie that lacks direction and tone. Half of the time it was sad and dramatic, and other times it was 'funny'. It was neither and ultimately failed at both. The 50 Cent cameo was obviously phoned in; his role was neither funny or complimentary to the plot. Jason Statham's role was similar; I found his general dickheadedness more annoying than funny. The fact that he showed up in every scene, against all logic, was even worse. Rose Byrne was predictable, which is a shame, because I do believe she's a very talented actress in the right roles (Damages, 28 Weeks Later). The villain is in the movie for about 10 minutes total - know nothing about this mastermind that we don't even hear that much about. Jude Law, who 'dies' in the first 10 minutes of the film, is a douche. His death is supposed to be emotional. Are you seeing the problem? How are we supposed to be sad about a character we barely know? The film sets this scene up from nothing.Also, this movie is needless profane; I nearly walked out. I really didn't spend $18 just to see some guy's erect cock on a camera. I don't get it. Is it funny? Is it shocking? Either way, the movie could've done without it. McCarthy constantly switches between sweet/shy to mind-numbingly profane. Swears come out of her mouth like free gifts from Oprah.The only saving grace in this movie is McCarthy's sidekick, whose name I forgot because she was severely underused. She was far funnier than McCarthy. This movie should've been her in the lead, with somebody like Stephen Merchant somewhere in the mix.Anyway, this movie blows hard.

You might as well watch a porn movie with your family, friends, and wife. absolutely disgusting. They could have censored it but I guess this generation loves it. There is way too much profanity as well. It switches between comedy and stupid. For some weird odd reason, MCCARTHY's movies all seem the same! I decided this will be the last movie I ever watch with her. Totally predictable as well. I only wanted to watch it because of the rating on here but it's definitely is not worth that rating! I give it a 1 out of 10. Please do yourself a favor and save your time by not watching this movie. All the people involved in this movie should be ashamed of themselves. This movie is nothing but proof that our world is degrading.",Spy
475,bballaAG,The amount of humor doesn't make up for the cheesy acting,5,7 June 2015,"OK, Melissa Mccarthy is funny. She has her scenes where you laugh out loud so badly that your stomach starts to crunch up. Hoping that this movie would cause the same reaction wasn't asking for much. I mean, Bridesmaids, The Heat and Mike and Molly provide this reaction quite often. I hate to say it but, this movie did not provide enough laughs to cause this reaction, unfortunately. Melissa's chemistry with the fellow actors Statham, Law and Hart provided some spark throughout the movie, but I was reminded to often about the lack of well written characters. What was Stathams relevance in this movie? In the trailers, he was portrayed as acting side-by- side with Mccarthy, but this wasn't the case. Statham was a nobody throughout the film and probably could've been left out. The worst issue with this film is that it was very predictable. From the beginning to the end, I knew exactly what was going to happen. Without giving out any spoilers, I knew that it would end like that. If you want to laugh, maybe 15 minutes or so during a film and not care much about the actual story, then this film if for you. For all the others who want an actual storyline with characters that matter, skip this one and wait for a real Melissa Mccarthy comedy to come out.",Spy

It was self aware of how stupid and ridiculous it is. And it was funnier than expected.Melissa McCarthy delivers the best of her comedic talent in this movie. I liked her in Bridesmaids (which surprisingly got her a nomination at the Oscars) and The Heat, but this might be her funniest role to date. Not only because of Paul Feig's direction, but due to the fact that her character actually does stuff and not act like a silly, annoying, fat person.The movie's pacing was fast and never slow. One of the problems in modern comedies is how dragging the pacing and jokes are. In this movie, they feel refreshing. I don't know about you, but Paul Feig's direction of the action scenes are golden for a comedy like this. He also pulls off some cool one liners in the script.Among the best parts of the movie is Jason Statham. Having played badasses in the past, it's nice to see Statham play that stereotype in a light and comedic film and goddamn it, it worked. Rose Byrne, playing the villain, was funny as well. It's almost as funny as her appearance in Neighbors.Despite a formulaic plot, Spy is a moronic fun time at the movies that tickles you with non-stop laughter and filled with entertaining acting from Melissa McCarthy, Jason Statham, and Rose Byrne.

I frankly think she is very talented, and hopefully this movie was just the dud of her career. This movie was terrible. It was not even entertaining. Basically the movie goes through some cliché spy movie stuff, of which this movie was meant to be a satire of, but fell terribly flat. The whole movie was filled from the viewpoint of feminist misconceptions. I am down for good political satire, but this was so out there that it did not work.

But instead of handling it like a bludgeoning weapon, the script treats its subdued use of profanity like a scalpel; delivering one-liners which me and my wife will be quoting each other for weeks as well as brilliant banter exchanges which showcase an amazing comedic chemistry.The show is smart, confident, quirky, fun and most of all hilarious.

Stop bashing Mccarthy about low self esteem and how she shamed herself etc. It is precisely because she is confident in what she does, she has no problem making fun of herself.

The lines that Melissa McCarthy and Jason Stathom pull off with straight faces are comedic genius. I admit the addition of 50 Cent is a bit odd but even that ends up being funny. Relax, people!

Don't take your children to this one...it insults our intelligence.,3,25 June 2015,"The course language, grade-school banter, and sexually-overt situational slapstick was over done. The director lost control on this movie; it seems as though Paul Feig had his dialogue and conduct cues coming form speed dialling his production assistant, who may or may not have been front and centre at a back-alley-brawler's 'fight club' whilst roaming around in the 'Red-Light' districts of Budapest. There was very little done in consideration of mastering the English language and demonstrating SOME maturity this immature and petty movie. -No ORIGINALITY or IMAGINATION on how intelligent people would or should handle bruised egos, sexual tension, and anger without reaching for the toilet and licking it before their ""lines"" came due. Action-comedies can be well done; This one was not. Though there are several funny moments in 'Spy',they become regrettably forgettable because you want to wash your ears out with soap or wish you could NOT see THAT again. Action-Comedy in the ranks of most Jackie Chan projects and the Movies: 'True Lies', 'MIB', will be entertaining for decades - Raunchy, perverted, spoof-satires will be 'bottom shelf' as long as intelligent people are choosing to be entertained and stimulated by their experience and not wanting their sensibilities attacked. I'm sure the BOX OFFICE statistics will reflect my opinion. This movie will NOT have the staying power of other Movies in this category. Here's hoping that his remake of Ghostbusters will have better, less egregious situational dialogue.It was nice to see Jason in some comic relief (he can be very funny in a serious way). His role as an unfocused, blundering-action-agent (slash) Mr.Bean-with-a-gun was a funny distraction, but I don't really think Jason Statham needed to take this project on. He really should have said NO to Mr.Feig and moved onto any number of projects which other, better, Directors were waiting for him to say 'Yes' to. Jason: you're an ""A-List"" actor. 'Spy' made me think you were slipping onto the ""B-List""...You really can just say ""NO!"". Melissa; shame on you for being so desperate as to allow yourself to be exploited and humiliated for a pay cheque. - It's a long way back to wholesomeness and sensibility for a beautiful woman worthy of so much better than what this movie gave to you (and left with us). You would have done better on a set with a Director who respected more of your talents, rather than with Feig, who lowered your standards.I think this movie will make some money and make a few people moderately wealthy - but the question remains: Should this movie have been made at all?",Spy

The comedy and writing was great enough but, this is one of the first films where you actually see an equal distribution of male and female actors.It is not just an androcentric viewpoint but much more realistic.

After watching Spy (which included skipping through half of it, except for Jason Statham's portions) I kept wondering if he was talking about the same movie. So, what were you on, Mr. Travers?Melissa McCarthy is arguably the best comedian at work right now (The Heat was just incredible!), but with Spy she had nothing to work with apart from a bunch of contrived jokes and situations that probably escaped from Dane Cook's stand-up material and took refuge in Paul Feig's mind. God knows, the entire cast did their best to salvage some form of comedy from a juvenile script that felt like it was written by a 11-year old brat with a laptop, half a brain and no sense of humor. (You know a film's trying too hard when it pulls out the 'puke on dead body' card. Oh yeah, Spoiler Alert!)Feig's probably a good director but going by what I saw, he's also probably a stinky writer. What a waste of a killer cast! Statham was good, but maybe that's because we've never seen him like this. His performance merits a comedy movie of his own (hopefully not written by Feig). So, Mr. Travers. WTF did you watch? What were you on? Did you trip into a chamber full of laughing gas while watching the movie? Yeah, I know what I'm saying is subjective. Maybe I just didn't get the humor, for which, I'm actually thankful. But still, what were you on, sir? Whatever it is, I hope you're on it when you're watching my movie (if I end up making one).

Spy has a good start but it quickly and consistently deteriorates toward the end with cheap jokes, extremely repetitive and ineffective profanity and sub-par special effects. It definitely had funny, almost hilarious moments in it but there were very few of those. I can understand that one of the goals was to create a refreshingly modern comedy by injecting current cultural trends and standards but it completely loses its grip on the ""comedy"" part. The consistent cursing ruins the dialogs and gets very annoying, and I usually don't have a problem with fowl language in films. Even with apparent hints of feminism, the movie seems to consistently humiliate its main female characters in the name of comedy. The plot is weak, to say the least, but then again it's a spy comedy and that was expected. Having seen other works of Paul Feig like Bridesmaids and The Heat, I was very disappointed with this one.",Spy
507,dailyplanet-30037,If you love Bruce Willis's RED you're gonna like SPY,8,17 October 2015,Not bad at all. 119 min well spent.It's hard to find spy movies these days but some how SPY made it. The humor is good without too many slapstick and Melissa played the female spy role nicely.The use of F words by Susan and Ford is also very entertaining and not offensive. Guaranteed to make you LOL.The hi-tech gadgets is surprisingly funny but yet useful during the mission.Cant wait for the sequel and hope SPY2 will be as good as this one with more F words.,Spy
508,adminrbc,Crude to the core,1,20 October 2015,"I was looking forward to this spoof movie, thinking it was going to take the mickey out of the genre. With the rating I expected the occasional expletive. Boy, was I wrong. It had all the potential and indeed had it's moments. However, I think the dialogue of every lead role was 50% ""F...."" words. I'm thinking, ""how long did it take to throw that script together? After all the expletives were noted, half the script was complete! Jason Statham's character in particular cursed no end.Add to this the graphic in-your-face scene where someone's penis is graphically put on display in any number of angles for about 30 seconds - nudity that has simply nothing to do with the storyline, and you wonder if this movie is not about satiating the director's exhibitionism. My wife was highly offended, and I cringe to think how many teen girls would've seen the scene. Hard-core porn has a new outlet.Eventually my wife and I could no longer stand the relentless onslaught of unjustified expletives and stopped watching, something I very seldom do.What a waste of talent. A low point in Jason Statham and other main actors' careers in my opinion. Disgusted!",Spy
509,mackohazy,Good comedy for an easy afternoon,8,8 November 2015,I am recommending this movie for those who are a bit tired of Adam Sandler's mainstream comedies of last years and want to have a good time with good actors gathered in the cast. I really loved the original English sounds but for Hungarians I do recommend the Hungarian dub since it worked out really well with top hit voices and Hungarian specific wording to maximize the fun. I was really glad to see Budapest in a movie where it is not Berlin or someplace else but simply Budapest not to mention that I think this is the first foreign movie where lake Balaton appears that is the top inland summer destination for Hungarians. The movie is a good adventure with nice characters to follow in my opinion it worths the time to watch and probably all members of the family can find some fun in it somewhere.,Spy
510,davidlgriffin,Not to be missed,8,10 November 2015,"Started to watch this film with some scepticism. I wrongly assumed that this film would be cheesy with the usual jokes and one liners. My interest was raised by the details in the special effects and I loved the way the film jumped in to the comedy. From that point it was laugh out loud until the end. I would recommend this film to anyone, but with a warning. Do not watch with your children or your parents unless you don't mind a few very awkward moments. It may hold a 15 certificate but call me old fashioned as after watching I would have said it should have been a 18. Negatives, I'm sorry to say I was not impressed with Miranda Hart performance, but in fairness to her I'm not a fan, but it did not spoil the film for me. Jason Statham on the other hand was brilliant. I would love to see a Spy 2 made with the same cast, but for me less of Miranda.",Spy
511,kyleliseno,What happened in the middle?,5,17 November 2015,"Let me start by saying the movie wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great. I was able to make it to the end but was left scratching my head.Melissa McCarthy's character is the nice well-mannered relative that comes over during the holidays. She has a very innocent vibe to her. Then in the middle of the film she turns into a foul mouth bodyguard/bully.I was under the impression that she was doing it for her cover but even when her cover is blown she keeps it up, even to the end of the film.It's as if the writer halfway said F*ck it.This is a movie that you watch once and let it collect dust.",Spy
512,sdepillo,Ran out of jokes,3,4 January 2016,"The first half of the movie was entertaining enough, but the overall effort gets dragged down by a screenplay that seemed written by a team of 9th grade boys who suddenly realized they could drop an F-bomb any time they want. You can tell when a comedy is desperate when it resorts to this tactic, and resort SPY certainly does. By the end of this carpet F-bombing, I found myself more dazed than amused. Even when it tries for a sight gag or joke to make you laugh, it's something you've seen before in a similar, and incredibly better, ""heavy, funny person turned hero"" movie such as Paul Blart I or II (admittedly, I haven't seen PB II, but it HAS to be better). Bottom line, you'd be better served for laughs by a Mike and Molly rerun.",Spy
513,guttersnipe-24720,Beginning kind of draws you off but the mid-movie until the end wasn't bad at all,7,7 January 2016,"The beginning of this movie is full of bad jokes as we see Melissa McCarthy slew in a pile of worthless banter between someone she has a crush on. Reminded me of High school honestly. And if I weren't being honest, I'd tell you I went through this whole movie the first time I watched it.I saw the first 25-30 minutes and straight turned it off. Too bad that part of the movie is important for character development or else I'd just tell you to skip it.I figured what the heck I'll give it another try. This isn't my type of humor quite frankly but I like Jason Statham and Melissa McCarthy, but it seems she's stuck in this underdog position with too much to prove all the time. Meanwhile that's not really the case as she actually is just a ticking time bomb ready to go off but apparently has been equipped without a timer. Jason Statham on the other hand is pretty far off from how he usually is in other movies... which actually is a refreshing change.It actually makes for a pretty good action-comedy when you get pretty deep into the movie, about 40 minutes. I was probably non- stop laughing from there on out as I really try hard to immerse myself in movies no matter how bad so I can write accurate reviews. I tend to shy away from those people who just automatically give a movie no chance whatsoever and give it the worst rating possible.There's also a character in the movie called 'Aldo' which in my opinion is my favorite character in this movie slightly ahead of Jason Statham (would be in Melissa McCarthy's favor but she has this repeated pattern of raunchy behavior that sort of draws me off to her, although some of her jokes were not bad and required her to be there as well). All in all the movie isn't something like Blazing Saddles but it was a good laugh until the end. I wouldn't even watch this with my family honestly because of how weird it can get sometimes but if you can look past that for the real jokes it's definitely outweighs the bad, and no regrets watching it whatsoever.",Spy
514,randyest,"Formulaic, unfunny, pandering garbage",1,30 July 2016,"My wife and I could not even finish this movie it was so bad. We thought Statham, who she loves, might make for a good time. Instead we're watching utterly outrageous unfunny nonsense where every man is a bumbling fool (or dead) and this obviously out-of-shape morbidly obese woman is flipping around like a ninja. It's so obviously a normal-sized athletic person in a fat suit it's not even funny. The attempts at witty quips and jokes are literally painful to watch and hear. There is more cringe in this movie than you'd find at a My Littly Pony convention.I dare you to try to make it through the whole thing. No, I take that back -- I wouldn't wish that on anyone.",Spy
515,bexleydrivevintage,Best comedy in years,10,4 August 2016,"I watch this at least once a week. It just gets better and funnier as it goes along following Melisss's character and her side kick. This movie wouldn't have worked without Miranda. Great yin and yang! Theyshould remake AbFab! Melissa as Edina ans Miranda as a super tall Patsy. AbFab on Speed! I can't wait for the sequel. This was a brilliant movie for adults, apparently some people are squeamish. I'm lucky I'm not a little bitch who leaves 10 bad reviews from different emails because my 12th cat died. I don't understand these bad reviews unless it's just haters with a bible up their butts. They'll probably vote For Trump lol. Ewwwwwwww can you say passé? I don't trust reviews usually so I'm here to say this movie actually made me laugh. Nothing makes me laugh anymore. Five stars",Spy

518,hardstyletempest,"Statham, the only reason",7,25 August 2017,"Trailer looked exciting. I like Mccarthy but I like Statham more. He made the movie worth watching. There are instances where you can loose your instances but McCarthy and Statham's comedy chops will keep you going, just bear with some of the clichés. There are ups and downs. The ""twist"" I'm sure people saw it coming but was funny none the less",Spy
519,addiforras,Actually Hilarious,8,31 August 2015,"I went in to see this film with zero knowledge and zero expectations - I don't even think I saw the trailer. I laughed the entire time!The movie plays out as a parody of James Bond films and even pokes fun at the Jason Statham breakneck action type of movies, featuring Melissa McCarthy in one of her best roles yet. As far as I can remember, this is Melissa's first role in which she does not play the ""gross, clumsy, fat chick"" but instead portrays a fiercely intelligent, tough, 3 dimensional woman who ends up in ridiculous situations, and ends up being incredibly skilled at fighting off gangsters. Sure - it may be unrealistic, but it makes for a great, interesting comedy. Susan (Melissa's character) is a relatable middle- aged woman, who is feminine, takes good care of herself, longs for unattainable love, has a close girl friend who has her back, and works her ass off. You root for her, you laugh at her shockingly good insults and come-backs, and you understand her motives for her actions. Some of the characters seem to be poking fun at their ""stereotype"" in other movies of their career. Jason Statham, like I mentioned before, is mostly cast in high-speed, intense action films - and in SPY, his character goes above and beyond this. Ford (Statham's character) believes himself to be so intense and invincible that all the other characters roll their eyes at him and basically tells him to ""just calm the eff down"". He ends up getting in the way and causing more problems than actually doing any good. A fact that I personally loved to see play out. Give it a shot. I'm buying the DVD as soon as it comes out.",Spy
520,gbogdann,Surprised? You bet I was.,4,29 February 2016,"Unfortunately, after almost a year since its release, the rating of this film and the positive reaction of people are still flabbergasting.I watched this ""comedy"" about a month or two ago with a friend, hoping for a good laugh-out-loud, since it had a rating of 7.2, i think, at that time. Well, what we got was a very predictable, clichéd mess. It starts out decent, right up until a character dies (first 10-15 minutes or so, and no, it's not a spoiler) and guess what, our no-one-sees-me-no-one-loves-me field adviser(or whatever she was) becomes a spy. Why? Because she went berserk some time ago and apparently that's how little it takes to be sent on a stakeout. I, for one, was not expecting that kind of turn of events, so cool!So, needless to say, everything goes downhill from here, you can figure out the whole movie from the first 20 minutes (that's how good the plot twist is), mainly because you have seen this so many times before in the same below-average comedies. Sure, you squeeze in a chuckle or two, but that's about it. They try really hard to be funny, but the jokes are used up and constantly swearing is not a go-go in the world of refined sense of humor (unless your humor has its capital in Adam Sandler-ville).7.1 people? Come on, i still have hope for humanity, don't take that from me. I give it a 4. And that's me being a really nice guy about it.",Spy
521,radostinalmarinova,Offensive,1,26 July 2018,"There are some funny parts BUT really NOT COOL what they say about Bulgaria. Not true and very offensive!! Bulgaria is a very beautiful European country. People live in their own European looking like apartments and houses there. Many in other countries can't afford that. There are many rich people just like anywhere else and believe me WOMEN are VERY beautiful. So this ugly words used in this movie and the horrible image that was created about Bulgaria is so untrue and mean! Such a disappointment! Lost at least 8 million people of the audience with this script ....Also +33 is the phone code of France not only of Paris. 
Just to be clear Paris is the capital of France, but it is not the whole country. So doesn't really make sence how they located the destination by the phone code ....",Spy
