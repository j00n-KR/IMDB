0,MartinHafer,This is a great film because of what it ushered in as opposed to its actual content...,7,26 February 2011,"I am a huge fan of the improvised mockumentaries and whatever you think of ""This is Spinal Tap"", you must acknowledge that it laid the groundwork for future projects with many of these same people. In other words, if it hadn't been for ""Spinal Tap"", you never would have had ""Waiting for Guffman"", ""Best in Show"" or ""A Mighty Wind""....or even mockumentaries done by entirely different casts, such as ""And God Spoke"".Oddly, however, I must say that although this was a seminal film, I am not a huge fan of it. I am not saying it's a bad film--it's just that their later projects were stronger (though I must acknowledge that they never gained cult status like ""Spinal Tap""). One of the biggest reasons is that I think that they honed their improvisational skills with subsequent projects (aside from ""For Your Consideration""--a film that simply stank). Less of the jokes fell flat in these later films--and many in ""Spinal Tap"" did. It's well worth seeing...but I think that with its huge reputation I was expecting a bit too much. Worth seeing but not among the best of the genre.",This Is Spinal Tap
1,TheLittleSongbird,One word: Classic!,10,3 September 2010,"Of the five or so movies of Rob Reiner's I have seen so far, all of them have ranged from very good to outstanding. This is Spinal Tap fits in the outstanding category, as it works simply brilliantly as a spoof and is one of the unsurpassed best of the genre. I love the mockumentary style in which it is filmed, and the production number is absolutely brilliant. The dialogue is absolutely hilarious, while there is real pleasure in the details especially in the intentionally crass lyrics.Rob Reiner's direction never hits a false note, while the performances of Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer are note-perfect, while Bruno Kirby, Anjelica Huston, Billy Crystal and Ed Begley Jnr support them brilliantly. All in all, brilliantly done and a must see. 10/10 Bethany Cox",This Is Spinal Tap
2,bkoganbing,Legends of Rock n' Roll,6,22 September 2017,"As This Is Spinal Tap came out in 1984 I'd like to think that the guys are doing those nostalgia type tours along the lines of Herman's Hermits and Bobby Rydell. They're not quite at the stage of the nostalgia tours, in fact this Mockumentary makes it clear that these guys have not seen that their time has come and gone.A tiny select few musical performers cross generations with their appeal and these guys aren't it. Rob Reiner directs and plays a documentary film maker who accompanies the band Spinal Tap on its latest American tour where all kinds of things go wrong. Some familiar people make cameo appearances. I kind of like Patrick MacNee as their record label president and Bruno Kirby as a limousine driver who has a more realistic insight than the musicians.This Is Spinal Tap has a lot of devoted fans. I'm not one of them though I recognize the importance of the film as a prototype of a new genre. Mockumentaries are an acquired taste and if that's the taste you've acquired than this is your film.",This Is Spinal Tap
3,SnoopyStyle,Mockumentary and Improvisation,8,24 February 2014,"It's 1982. Filmmaker Marty DiBergi (Rob Reiner) follows the comeback tour of legendary British heavy metal band Spinal Tap (Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, Harry Shearer) in America.Director Rob Reiner started something special here. This form of mockumentary with improvisation may have been done earlier, but Christopher Guest would take it to all new heights. Along with Michael McKean, Harry Shearer, and Rob Reiner, they push the comedy genre to unknown territories. The fact is the jokes are so densely packed and coming out of everywhere that it could be watch over and over again. The improvisation leads to an uncontrolled feeling to the comedy, and a realism that was probably unintended. Unlike other spoofs like Airplane or Naked Gun from Zucker, the jokes aren't machine gun fired. The improvisation lend itself to be uneven and jazzy in nature.",This Is Spinal Tap
4,Hitchcoc,I Wish I Could Give it an Eleven,10,27 April 2021,"Having watch all those vapid rock documentaries over the years, I've absorbed the style that appears. The great strength of this is that it is always understated. Spinal Tap is going on a reunion concert and is being followed by cameras. First of all, the concert scenes are wonderful, out of an era. They are often clueless about the world they inhabit. There are so many hilarious bits I can't enumerate. For example, the complaining about the sandwich meat and the size of the bread in their dressing room. The discussion of the album cover. On and on. It is the marvelous Christopher Guest troupe and the do the whole thing proud. I'm glad I saw it again after 35 years.",This Is Spinal Tap
5,classicsoncall,"""What do you say? Let's boogie"".",8,29 July 2016,"Totally outrageous and funny in the way it looks like the band members are playing it straight but sound like complete morons. Michael McKean excels at this kind of stuff but the other players held up their end real well too. Derek's (Harry Shearer) discourse on the band's two visionaries, David (McKean) and Nigel (Christopher Guest) was flat out hilarious, and I had to pause the film a minute to give due admiration for the Intravenous de Milo bit. The Stonehenge gimmick with the eighteen inch prop was pretty ridiculous too. Besides sending up the rock music scene in general, I thought director Reiner paid an off hand tribute to all those variety shows of an earlier era like 'The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour' and 'The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour', whose guest bands often performed with the flower power colors and psychedelic strobes and lava effects. I can't really say why I never checked out this film before, it's had a strong reputation and avid following for three decades now, but at least I'm a member of that club now. And say, who came up with this line - ""You can't really dust for vomit"". The writer deserves a free ticket to a Spinal Tap concert.",This Is Spinal Tap
6,gavin6942,Great Satire of the 1970s.1980s Metal Scene,8,5 April 2009,"I'm not going to write a real review for this film because it's just so classic, having received numerous honors. Christopher Guest, Harry Shearer and Michael McKean made their careers on this film. Rob Reiner might have gotten by with ""Spinal Tap"" (he had, for example, ""The Princess Bride"" a few years later)...And we also have very early appearances from Fred Willard, Fran Drescher, and Dana Carvey. Who would expect to see the three of them in one film? It took almost twenty years for Willard to really take off. Unfortunately, Bily Crystal also makes an appearance... the same mistake Reiner made in ""Princess Bride"". Sorry, Rob, that's just not right.",This Is Spinal Tap
7,jboothmillard,This Is Spinal Tap,8,10 January 2006,"This was the debut film from director Rob Reiner (When Harry Met Sally, Misery), and over the years it has become a cult classic. It is a spoof documentary, well Rockumentary, with film-maker Marty DiBergi (Reiner) following the career of heavy metal British rock band Spinal Tap through the years. The members are Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest, also writing) on lead guitar, David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean, also writing) also on lead guitar, Derek Smalls (The Simpsons' Harry Shearer, also writing) on bass, R.J. Parnell (Mick Shrimpton) on drums, and Viv Savage (David Kaff) on keyboards. It sees their rise to fame from the early 1960's to the present day with their magnificent music and impressive lyrics (not really). It also sees them preparing for their comeback tour to America, with their infamous eighteen-inch-high Stonehenge stage prop. Also starring June Chadwick as Jeanine Pettibone, Tony Hendra as Ian Faith, Bruno Kirby as Tommy Pischedda and Ed Begley Jr. as John 'Stumpy' Pepys, with cameos from Patrick Macnee as Sir Denis Eton-Hogg, Billy Crystal as Morty the Mime, Anjelica Huston as Polly Deutsch and Fred Willard as Colonel On Military Base. The band members are all wonderfully stupid, and even though they are rubbish at singing, accompanied by the music and amusing lyrics you can't help but like the songs. It is also a very well done satire of the rock industry itself, using all the music clichés available, and even being fictional, the film made the band so popular that they released albums for real. I admit I didn't get all the gags, but for the near-realistic documentary style, the characters, and of course the music, this certainly deserves to recognised as one of the best (fake) Rockumentaries ever made. It was number 29 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs, it was number 5 on The 100 Greatest Funny Moments, and it was number 10 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films. Very good!",This Is Spinal Tap
8,ccthemovieman-1,Must Have Been Hard To Keep A Straight Face,7,23 June 2007,"Overall, this was a pretty good farce about a washed-up English rock group. It's played as a mockumentary, (a fake documentary) with director Rob Reiner playing the role of the interviewer of the band. If it wasn't a movie in which you can retake scenes, I am sure we would have seen him laugh a number of the ""serious"" questions he asked this stupid band. I would think it would hard not to laugh in a number of places, because he plays a very serious interviewer. I'm sure he did many times.There are funny moments in here. The only part I really didn't like was near the end when the bickering of the band got out of control. Their constant arguing gets tough to take after awhile. That's another problem here; there are no appealing characters. This British band is not comprised of nice guys, and I also found their accents tough to understand. If this is out on DVD with English subtitles, it might be worth a second look.The music was fair, nothing to rave about. Overall, I enjoyed the movie but didn't find it anywhere as great as most critics described it. It's okay, but not that funny.One of the writers, Christopher Guest, has gone on to make several ""mockumentaries."" He has done quite well with that genre, better than Reiner. I've seen them all, and Guest's comedies are all entertaining to various degrees.",This Is Spinal Tap
9,Tweekums,The original rockumentary mockumentary,9,25 June 2011,"Anybody lucky enough to be around in the early eighties will remember the band 'Spinal Tap' well they would if they actually existed! 'Spinal Tap' is of course the original rockumentary mockumentary following the fictional band as they tour America in an attempt to sell their new album. Things do not go according to plan though; the album cover design has to be changed because their design is deemed sexist, gigs get cancelled and members of the band fall out. Even when they do perform things don't go according to plan; the scenes were the band perform around a tiny model of Stonehenge and the time a member of the band couldn't get out of a pod on stage were laugh out loud funny.This film is a classic of its type with some of the most quotable lines; even people who have never seen it will probably heard the 'turning it up to eleven' speech quoted in some way. While the band were not good they weren't so bad that they weren't believable; in fact a viewer who didn't recognise any of the cast could be forgiven for believing it was a real documentary! This is helped by black and white 'archive' footage of their early days and a filming style that looks like it was following real interviews rather than a more dramatic style. Whether you are a fan of the music of that time or just want a good laugh this film is a must see.",This Is Spinal Tap
10,BA_Harrison,Metal is NOT a fad.,10,10 December 2016,"A 'mockumentary' that affectionately spoofs the heavy rock genre, This Is Spinal Tap follows the titular group on a disastrous US tour to coincide with the release of Smell The Glove, their first album in six years.Director Rob Reiner's film is a firm favourite amongst metal-heads, despite mocking the music scene they love so much. This is because metal fans, myself included (a proud headbanger since the mid '80s), can acknowledge the often over-the-top theatricality and absurdity of their chosen genre, and have the intelligence to laugh along with it.And Spinal Tap is full of laughs: from Nigel the lead guitarist (Christopher Guest) proudly stating that his amp goes up to eleven, to the miniature stonehenge stage prop, to the band playing second on the bill after a puppet show, the film is full of great gags, with much of the dialogue being improvised to add to the authenticity of the documentary format.And to make things even better, the music is very good too: I have the Spinal Tap album on vinyl and it is packed with great tunes, from the early '60s songs 'Cups and Cakes' and 'Gimme Some Money', to their hippy hit '(Listen to The) Flower People', through to their heavy rock anthems 'Hell Hole', 'Sex Farm', 'Big Bottom' and, of course, the mighty 'Stonehenge', where the little children danced beneath the haunted moon10/10, although I would go up to 11 if IMDb allowed it.",This Is Spinal Tap
11,moonspinner55,Playful mockumentary with just a whiff of smugness,5,20 July 2006,"Rob Reiner directed this self-amused mockumentary on an outdated glitter-rock group named Spinal Tap, whose members are unaware how far they've fallen out of favor. This material might have made for the perfect short; yet as accurate as many of the jokes and targets are, the one-note satirical routines do get stretched a bit thin. The straight-faced cast, in an early precursor to the Christopher Guest troupe of players, is sometimes riotous-sometimes not, though Reiner is very adept with this type of dryly silly, scrappy film-making and he has a lot of fun with it. For music-biz aficionados, this became something of a cult film. It's low-budget, and definitely low-brow, but there are some big laughs scattered about. ** from ****",This Is Spinal Tap
12,Quinoa1984,Hello Cleaveland! Still one of the funniest films ever and even better on DVD,10,28 May 2001,"Spinal Tap seemed funny the first time I saw it, but I never got all the jokes.  Now though, I saw it through and through and I loved it even more (especially on DVD where the extras are hilarious).  Nearly every gag in the movie is dead pan funny, from the cover of ""Smell the Glove"" (just the description will make you laugh) to all the others including the three piece guitar solo, the animal costumes (""this is what you'll look like as a crab"" is the funniest line of the 80's next to ""Frank, they're not here for you, Weird Al is on the plane"" in Naked Gun), the backstage food, (of course) the amp that goes to 11 and the 18 inch stonehenge.  Satire at one of it's best, and it's excellent.  Cameos include Bruno Kirby, Billy Crystal, Dana Carvey, Paul Schaffer and Anjelica Houston.  Other best line: you can not do free flow jazz odyssey in front of a festival crowd!  A+",This Is Spinal Tap
13,BandSAboutMovies,Yes I can...,10,3 June 2021,"There is nothing I can say about this movie that can add or distract from it. It is a force of nature and in my opinion, the most perfect of movies. I've debated adding it to the site numerous times, but my worry was that it's so ingrained in my heart that there was no way I could do it justice. So instead, let me share my favorite scene from the movie and explain why it means so much to me and then you can just watch the damn thing yourself.As limo driver Tommy Pischedda (Bruno Kirby) drives Spinal Tap through New York City and all seems bright and the future wide open, he makes the faux pas of thinking that he can directly interact with rock gods. He looks in the back of his car and addresses one of their female admirers: ""Excuse me... are you reading ""Yes I Can""?""Tommy may not understand this heavy metal, but he does know the Rat Pack. That's the kind of celebrity culture that he understands. People that deserve to be there. People that have given blood and sweat and sacrificed. But maybe, just maybe, these longhaired kids are trying.""You know what the title of that book should be? ""Yes, I Can If Frank Sinatra Says It's OK,"""" shares Tommy. ""'Cause Frank calls the shots for all of those guys. Did you get to the part yet where uh...Sammy is coming out of the Copa...it's about 3 o'clock in the morning and, uh, he sees Frank? Frank's walking down Broadway by himself...""At this point, Nigel Tufnel, the guitarist of the band, rolls up the window that separates the celebrity from the hired help. It's a bracing and truth-packed moment, as the look on Tommy's face shows that he should have never opened himself to such scorn.Rockumentarian and Tap fan Marti DiBergi tries to deal with the chill in the air, offering, ""Well, you know, they're not, uh, used to that world. You know, Frank Sinatra, it's a different world that they're in.""The sheer exhaustion in Tommy's speech that follows, as well as his know-it-all feeling on the world of celebrity follows. ""You know, it's just that people like this...you know...they get all they want so they really don't understand, you know...about a life-like Frank's. I mean, when you've loved and lost the way Frank has, then you, uh, you know what life's about.""But what sums it all up is when he says, ""F****' limeys.""",This Is Spinal Tap

15,Theo Robertson,Clever Idea Badly Done,5,19 June 2004,"THIS IS SPINAL TAP a mock documentary ( Mockumentary ) where the audience are fooled into thinking they`re watching not very well known British rock band Spinal Tap touring the United States in 1982 . There`s actually a spark of genius to this and considering the director has understated things and the rock trio - Who are played by American actors - have totally convincing English accents there was every chance that someone watching this on its intial release would be fooled into thinking Spinal Tap were actually a real rock band , in fact it might have taken years for someone watching this to cotton onto the fact they`ve been fooled . If that`s the case why oh why do the production team shoot themselves in the foot by casting Patrick Macnee in something like the third scene of the movie ? Macnee is still very well known in the States via his role in THE AVENGERS and the penny must have dropped that this movie was a spoof by viewers who`d remember him and the movie also contains several well known faces in the cast . Talk about shooting yourself in the foot The more you realise this the more you realise it`s this that ruins the movie . If they`d cast totally unknown people we`d have seen people go into record stores asking if they`ve got Smell The Glove by Spinal Tap ( Actually the music isn`t that bad ) only to be met with a confused look and we`d have to write : !!!!!! MAJOR SPOILER !!!!!
THIS IS SPINAL TAP is a spoof documentary !!!!! END SPOILER !!!!! in our reviews and I can`t help wondering how much better this movie would have been if it had fooled everyone . As it is I don`t think it deserves to be in the IMDB top 250",This Is Spinal Tap
16,Hey_Sweden,Incredibly funny: a true comedy classic.,8,3 March 2013,"Comedic actors Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer show off their fantastic ability to improvise in this dead on parody of rock documentaries. Rob Reiner, making his feature film directing debut, and who co-wrote the script with the stars, plays a documentary filmmaker who decides to chronicle the latest tour of a veteran rock group that has clearly seen much better days.The movie features a very high amount of gags that actually work, and one can believe that, yeah, crazy stuff like this could very well happen in the world of rock 'n' roll. Among the best are the conceptual drawings of the band (""This is what you'd look like as a crab.""), the recreation of a piece of Stonehenge that is nowhere near as large as the band wanted, the amplifier that goes to 11, Nigels' description of a heart warming piece he's composed, and a truly gut busting sequence wherein the cover art for the bands' latest album is discussed.The three main actors are all wonderful and show a real talent for, and knowledge of, music as well as comedy, which really helps to create a level of believability. Some of their dialogue is truly hilarious. There's a lot of familiar faces in the supporting cast; the cameos are a delight.As a bonus, the music is really pretty good, and are accompanied by some of the silliest / most brilliant lyrics you'll ever hear.At 83 minutes in length, this doesn't go on any longer than it has to, and it maintains a superb forward momentum the entire time, coming up with one great laugh after another and remaining fresh and unpredictable.Highly recommended.Eight out of 11.",This Is Spinal Tap
17,dbborroughs,What once was fresh is now cliché,5,11 February 2005,"I remember seeing this on its original release and was very amused by it all. Here was a very funny low budget comedy that was actually funnier the more you knew. Unfortunately time has not been kind to Spinal Tap. While its importance in the history of film and culture can not be under estimated, the past 20 odd years have made it a cliché. Everyone has ripped it off or referenced it including all of those involved in it. Thats fine, however it makes sitting through it rather difficult since you've seen most of the jokes before, even if you haven't seen the movie before. I suppose there is some consolation that this was the seed from which a thousand mockumentaries and two million jokes sprung, but when you want to see a funny movie it kind of takes the laughter out of the evening.",This Is Spinal Tap
18,grantss,A comedic masterpiece,10,28 January 2016,"A comedic masterpiece.A documentary producer/director, Marty DiBergi, follows the hard- rock band Spinal Tap around on their reunion tour of the US. This is the outcome: a rock documentary - a rockumentary. Through interviews of the band he covers their history and creative processes, and captures some of their behind-the-scenes interactions. He also films some of their concerts and music. There's a reason they're not that well known...One of the funniest movies ever made. A great spoof of rock music, and the music industry in general. Just about every scene and line is iconic and quotable (eg ""Our amps go up to eleven"", the saga of the drummers). Very relatable too, especially to anyone who follows rock music. So many scenes that remind you just how superficial, pretentious and sometimes plain stupid rock musicians can be. Cringingly close to reality at times.Brilliant beyond description. So good this movie created a genre - the mockumentary.",This Is Spinal Tap
19,Uriah43,Probably Takes Some Getting Used To,5,7 April 2017,"This film is essentially about a so-called heavy metal group named ""Spinal Tap"" who have found that their customer base has been shrinking and have therefore launched a come-back tour to recapture their lost glory-as if they ever had any to begin with. Be that as it may, even though their new manager named ""Ian Faith"" (Tony Hendra) tries his best to set things up for their United States tour it soon becomes quite obvious that he is totally incompetent for the job at hand. Also quite evident is the fact that the band members are equally clueless about why their music doesn't attract large audiences. So they continue to produce one idiotic song after the other and devise all kinds of failed stage gimmicks in the mistaken belief that they are somehow on the verge of a major breakthrough. When these don't work the manager quits and is replaced by the lead singer's girlfriend ""Jeanine Pettibone"" (June Chadwick) who is even more incompetent than Ian ever was. Not surprisingly, things get even worse at that point. In any case, while this turned out to be a decent comedy for the most part, I should also mention that it probably takes some getting used to. Because of that, some viewers may not like it that much and I have rated it accordingly. Average.",This Is Spinal Tap
20,zetes,Deserves its fame,10,31 July 2000,"Spinal Tap has been called one of the funniest movies ever made by many people over the years. I had always been familiar with it. I was very familiar with almost 70% of the scenes: the amplifier that goes to 11, the Stonehenge dance, the inability to find the way onstage in Cleveland. Plus, when it was first released on VHS, I had rented and loved Fear of a Black Hat, a mockumentary about a rap group which more or less rips off every scene of This Is Spinal Tap. After finally sitting down with This Is Spinal Tap, I am still a fan of Fear of a Black Hat (and I recommend it to anyone who hasn't heard of it), but it can not come close to touching the genius of the collective vision of Rob Reiner, Christopher Guest, Micheal McKean and Harry Shearer. I laughed pretty much constantly, and belly laughs, all through the film. It does kind of slow down nearer the end with the bands falling apart (i.e., the plot gets in the way of the documentary), but there was never a scene in the film that didn't have something hilarious. I have to give this film 10/10. This Is Spinal Tarp, er, um, I mean Tap is one of the funniest comedies ever made.",This Is Spinal Tap
21,Sylviastel,I've waited 20 years to see it and now I know why Jamie fell in love with Guest!,9,22 April 2006,"There's nothing about this film that you probably have not heard. It is the film that introduced the young Barron Christopher Guest to his future wife, Jamie Lee Curtis. They are one of today's most successful and happy couples in Los Angeles. While Jamie lee has never been directed by her husband, Christopher Guest must be one of the shyest geniuses in Hollywood today. He has never casted his famous wife or equally famous in-laws (Janet Leigh or Tony Curtis). I thought he directed this film. He did not but Rob Reiner who plays in it too. I have seen most of Christopher Guest films like Best in Show, A Mighty Wind, and I just adore his directing style. He has the same group of talented actors like Michael McKean, Harry Shearer, JEnnifer Coolidge, Jane Lynch, Parker Posey, Catherine O'Hara, EUgene Levy, etc. This film shows the beginning of his genius as well. It is written by the stars and not some nameless screenwriters. In fact, actors and actresses so adore working with Guest as a director that they are always returning to work with him again and again. He should be recognized for his wittiness and unique brand of humor that he has wonderfully given us. Too bad he is happily married.",This Is Spinal Tap
22,mm-39,Ok,7,7 December 1999,"This film has many funny spots, and is great to watch with a group of guys over beers.  The film came out at the peak of the 80's metal explosion, and is dated. I grew up in the 80's, and find this film on the mark for satire about big hair, leather pants, and overly macho attitudes.(which reminds me about hanging out at the 7/11 on a Friday night)  Anyways, this film is slow in spots, and should be watched with a group of people; some of the humor will be missed, and I caught it the second time around.  The airport scene, the interview at the end, and the amp that goes to 11 make this film interesting.",This Is Spinal Tap
23,Mr-Fusion,Comic brilliance,8,20 May 2014,"""This Is Spinal Tap"" is certainly not without its memorable moments (Nigel's 50 guitars and amp that goes up to 11; the Stonehenge prop, Harry Shearer trapped in the cocoon; the free-form jazz odyssey), but its genius derives from the biting satire - and yet still loving in its sendup of the British metal scene. And these guys say these insane lines without bursting into laughs! And there's more than a few familiar faces sprinkled throughout the cast: Angelica Huston, Fred Willard, Bruno Kirby, Billy Crystal and a not-yet-annoying Fran Drescher. It's a very fun movie; the wit is sharp (for a group of dunces), the tone is just perfect, and it features ""Big Bottom"" and ""Sex Farm"", two of the funniest songs ever written.8/10",This Is Spinal Tap
24,christopher-underwood,it is not quite funny enough,7,19 March 2020,"Thought I would cheer us up with a fresh Blu-ray viewing of this classic, but found it rather hard going. As a concept it is brilliantly conceived and produced. Everything, including the music, the individual band members, the manager and the hangers on, is believable but it is not quite funny enough. There are great lines but some of the broader stuff seems to be striking at rather easy targets. Yes, there was a naivety (and frankly an ugliness) to some of the early 60s rock and yes, much of the early flower power stuff looks silly now and, of course, the whole heavy metal scene is crazy and all rock musicians are stupid and lets all have a good laugh 'cause we are film people not talentless ego maniacs who become prima donnas before they have learnt all three chords.

25,Smells_Like_Cheese,Nothing but laughs from beginning to end,8,15 July 2006,"This is Spinal Tap wasn't what I expected, but still I had some great laughs from this flick. I can see where people really thought that this was a true story, I almost believed it to be a real documentary. I just loved the pod scenes, where one of the Tap members gets stuck in the set and it doesn't get fixed until the end of the song. I know that doesn't get the biggest laughs for most, but for some reason that part just killed me. I also loved the whole explanation of why the stereo volume goes up to ""11"" and not just 10. I would highly recommend This is Spinal Tap for a good laugh, I can see why it is so popular. It's a true tribute to Rock -n- Roll and what a band goes through just to put some entertainment into people's lives.8/10",This Is Spinal Tap
26,Red-Barracuda,Comedy just doesn't get any better than this,10,20 August 2014,"It's probably easiest just cutting to the chase with this one and to lay my cards out on the table and state that I consider This is Spinal Tap to possibly be the best comedy film ever made. With this movie, director Rob Reiner along with fellow writer/actors Michael McKean, Harry Shearer and Christopher Guest devised a type of comedy that it took decades for everybody else to catch up with. The trick was that they delivered very funny material in a manner that always held on to reality. There is never any over comic acting or nudging to camera, the humour is consistently grounded in reality and that is core quality of the film. Many of the very best subsequent TV comedies have taken this approach religiously, such as 'I Am Alan Partridge', 'The Office', 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' – amongst many others. The influence of Spinal Tap is immeasurable in this sense. Back in the early 80's this comedy style was pretty uncommon and hence many thought that this mockumentary was in fact a documentary.The performances are crucial with the three leads being particularly brilliant and all side characters being quite excellent as well. A lot of the dialogue was improvised and this explains the naturalistic flow of things – you can easily re-watch this and discover brilliant lines buried in overlapping dialogue for example. This is one of those films that really doesn't feel like it should be reviewed in the traditional sense because there are simply far too many moments of comedy genius that recounting them all would take forever. It's quite simply a movie that just needs to be seen. It never gets old in any way and remains as funny now as it ever was.",This Is Spinal Tap

So, finally, after three decades, I finally learned more about ""the band.""Now, in my (very weak) defense, all jokes would've flown straight over my decade-old head and the many, many actors involved – I would've recognize, yet. So, it's probably best to see it as an adult anyways. I'm super glad I finally did.The movie was hilarious and a ton of this held up 32 years after release. Plus, I couldn't believe how many actors I recognized even though they may/may not have even been slightly known back then. Practically every scene or two, someone else popped up that I was like ""Oh! That's ____!"" But, beyond the stars Rob Reiner got to appear, the movie was genuinely funny. Personally, I thought it had more opportunities to be hilarious, but then I wasn't one of the writers and might have changed the tone to a ton more slapstick. It is what it is and that isgood comedy.Basically, it's a mockumentary (God, I love those) about an aging and D- List rock band who go through most of what real life bands do sans drugs. Not sure why that wasn't touched on, but again NOT-writer here. The music was actually good, the direction of the decline in the band's tour realistic to the storyline and running gags (drummer boys, anyone?) always humorous. Plus it's runtime at a mere 82 minutes was JUST enough. Nothing else needed to be said. Any additional footage probably would've hindered the film.Totally a recommendation if you've never seen this. ***Final thoughts: Long before Russell Brand was a brand, this has his style/name written all over it. Hope for no remake, but I can see him in one of the roles, easily.",This Is Spinal Tap
29,Lejink,Excess all areas,8,5 September 2008,"The IMDb Key Plot-words says it all really...how many movies can you think of which list ""cucumber"" as one of its key words? In case you haven't seen it by the way, afore-mentioned cucumber is the culmination of only one of several hilarious sight gags in this priceless send-up of the early 80's rock industry. It's almost as much fun trying to work out just which naff bands from that era Spinal Tap are based on...me, I can obviously see references to Black Sabbath (complete with Sharon Osbourne-type interfering wife-cum-manager!) and veteran UK boogie-merchants Status Quo with their psychedelic beginnings and twin-guitarist, intellectually-challenged duo of Francis Rossi and Rick Parfitt, heck they seem to almost prophesy Van Halen and they got to the Black Album years before Metallica! Everybody plays it dead straight which garners maximum comic effect and the set-piece gags are brilliantly set up and deliver big laughs every time. Favourite scenes...? Too many to count but how about the band getting lost on the way to the stage of a dingy Stateside university, harmonising at Graceland, the finger-sandwich scene, the miniature Stonehenge backdrop, replete with to-scale dancing druid-dwarfs, not forgetting the pod-busting sequence. The ridiculously over-the-top sexist lyrics to the Iron Maiden riffed songs will also crack you up. I've actually no time at all for the heavy-metal genre of music, especially its early 80's spandex era so scathingly targeted here (Whitesnake anyone?) and sometimes wonder if true HM fans are in on the joke even as they laugh along with the rest of us... Either way, a spoof movie of the rock scene which sets the gold standard for all succeeding ""rockumentaries"" (serious and comic!) just as ""Airplane"" and ""The Naked Gun"", to name but two did for disaster movies and cop-shows respectively.",This Is Spinal Tap
30,ElMaruecan82,The Doc' Rock that Rocks... to Eleven and Beyond!,10,26 July 2017,"""Why don't you just make 10 louder, and make 10 be the top number, and make that a little louder?"" I was so entranced by Nigel's enthusiastic description of his unique amplifier-model-that-goes-to-eleven that I almost failed to grasp the common sense in Marty Di Bergi's question. It's not about the number indeed but the acoustic referential to determine the degrees of loudness. But how can you teach such a flatly simple notion to someone who doesn't even let you point at the most precious item of his guitar collection.But it's subtler than that, the joke isn't at Nigel's obliviousness but at the fact that his reaction doesn't come as a surprise, Marty's question is almost funnier in the way it makes us expect ""something"". And boy does it reward our expectations, Nigel doesn't even answer, he stops chewing his gum, marks a solemn pause and provides the iconic, laconic and self-sufficient ""these go to eleven"". Both scenes and quotes became staples of 80's comedy summing up what makes Rob Reiner's directorial debut ""This is Spinal Tap"" one of the all-time greatest comedies: it knows its subject and what's more, it knows the right attitude to 'amplify' the comedic effects (to eleven and beyond).Everyone knows this is a film about a fictional rock band; the word 'fake' would be too misleading and even insulting. Spinal Tap might not belong to Rock'n'Roll canon, among the Beatles or the Rolling Stones but it's got something to say about rock, as a music, a spirit and a business. In fact, you might learn even more stuff about from this band than any documentary about a real group. And if I had to choose between learning with laughs or without, I'd rather have laughs. Who wouldn't? That's what makes the ""eleven"" scene so hilarious. Apart from the pedagogical value on the field of amplifiers, the way Christopher Guest delivers the quotes with that deadpan expression turns a rather banal quote into a punch-line of comedic genius. And all the movie works with the same mechanisms, David St Hubbins (Christopher McKean) and Derek Smalls (Harry Shearer) are totally oblivious to the hilarity of their statements, all delivered in the most casual way.That first scene alone is one of the highest summits of comedy and sets the tone of zaniness that will structure all the gags, from their first name ""The Originals"" to the first drummer (played by Ed Begley Jr.) who died in a freak accident, in fact every single drummer's accident is a try-not-to-laugh challenge where I fail every time. But again, it's not just the writing, mostly improvised, but also the acting, the documentary-like shooting allows many abrupt cuts and swiftly eluded moments where one couldn't keep a straight face.Watching the band telling these anecdotes about a drummer choking in someone else's vomit (""which police can't dust off"") or one that exploded suddenly is funny enough, but the face of Reiner repeatedly nodding as if it was really serious is the key to the film's enjoyment. And most of the gags involved the craziest situations where they all try to keep a straight face, Smalls being locked in a cocoon, the group lost backstage, and some verbal delights involving a sexist disc cover not to mention terrific cameos that include Fran Dresher, Bruno Kirby and Anjelica Huston.And the film never forgets to rock as a doc as well, it follows all the details of a tour organization and the struggle of the manager played by Tony Hendra, to book a concert, a hotel suite, or deal with matters of size from bread that is too small for the ham or a Stonehedge replica risking to be crushed by two gig-dancing dwarfs (paraphrasing David). You have a gag that works in a tertiary tempo, the set-up when you know there's going to be trouble. Then you have the musical interlude where you wait for the majestic entrance of the replica and the reactions of the band (who didn't know). The film even provides a little icing on the cake with St Hubbins' final comment.So, it might be improvised, but there's a sense of timing as acute and inspired as if it was used for music. The best compliment one can make to the film is that these guys are as good as musicians as they're comedians. And as far as I'm concerned, their music is credible enough to make the film feel real. And what makes the authenticity so palpable lies on these subtleties you notice after several viewings. The most delightful aspect involves the homoerotic subtext between Nigel and David (let's face It, Smalls is only slightly more famous than the drummers) and when Nigel's girlfriend comes in the picture, there's just something fading in Nigel it's actually touching.""This is Spinal Tap"" recreates the documentary feeling without resorting to cheap laughs. Near the end, there's even a sort of bittersweet feeling as their path comes to its logical conclusion, this might explain why many artists like Ozzie Osborne didn't actually laugh at it, that's how accurate it was. And the miracle of this film is to have provided powerful insights about rock business through a lousy and fictional band. But the film aged so well that no one would even use these adjectives to Spinal Tap, and rightfully so.And that concludes my 1111th review for IMDb, seriously, what other film would have I picked for this occasion? And while you're here, you might check one of the polls I suggested a few years ago about four-word movie quotes, guess which movie took the 11th spot? Yeah, that's right!",This Is Spinal Tap
31,bowmanblue,This is a great film,9,4 August 2015,"The word 'cult' was pretty much invented for 'This is Spinal Tap.' It's hard to say who the target audience is, but it's fair to say that whoever it is, it's a 'niche' group. 'Mockumentaries' are commonplace these days in both film and TV, but back in 1984, they were a lot rarer. Here, we have a (fake) fly-on-the-wall documentary about Britain's loudest rock band 'Spinal Tap' as they release a new album and try to tour America at the same time.The best thing about the film is that it never openly makes fun of its subject matter. The band may be made up of self-absorbed, egotistical, long-haired idiots, but, the strange thing is, you actually care about them. They're hardly the brightest bunch and their lack of intelligence does mean that we – the audience – do feel superior (and even sorry on some occasions) for them when things go wrong. And they frequently go wrong.Spinal Tap may be Britain's 'loudest' group, but their star is fading and the tour is not as 'sell out' as they'd like it to be. Sometimes it's actually quite sad watching them as they desperately try to hang onto the life they were once used to.Like I said at the beginning, it's hard to know who the 'target audience' for This Is Spinal Tap' really is. The comedy is more subtle than your average 'laugh-a-minute-fest' and you need to have an appreciation for both mockumentaries and also darker, black humour. Plus a love of heavy metal and/or rock music should help.Many films don't age well. At least this one has bad haircuts that were as bad at the time of filming as they are today! Also, special mention to Michael Mckean, who puts on a great British accent like he's a native.",This Is Spinal Tap
32,ericstevenson,Here's where the phrase started,9,19 February 2018,"On TVTropes, I constantly heard the phrase ""Up To Eleven"" being used. I even frequently used it myself when editing the website, even though I had never seen the movie. The funny thing is that even in the movie itself they make fun of this. It features the interviewer wondering why they don't just make ten louder. I didn't even recognize Harry Shearer in this. He's such a talented entertainer I have to acknowledge him.The funniest line is probably when they mention choking on vomit, but not his own vomit. The biggest appeal to this movie is probably how realistic it is. Spinal Tap isn't a real band, but they certainly seem like one here. With all the controversy and crazy things going on bands, it's great to have a piece of satire like this. Everyone acts like they are in a real documentary and while not as good as ""Borat"", still a significant film. I'll ignore ""An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn!"" over this. ***1/2",This Is Spinal Tap

It is such an audacious directorial debut for Reiner, who also plays a filmmaker documenting the comeback tour, that he has yet to make a better film. It's brimming with hilarious moments (interviews, song lyrics, stage performances, internal squabbles).

Highlights include the rant about miniature sandwiches, the Stonehenge fiasco, the band unable to find the stage in Cleveland, and the amp that goes to 11.",This Is Spinal Tap
39,sol-,Talented on stage; crazy off stage,6,4 February 2017,"Filmed in documentary style, this fiction film chronicles the ups and downs on a rock band on tour with a penchant for outrageousness. The songs are highly memorable throughout (especially 'Big Bottom' and 'Stonehenge') and kooky touches include a party in which all the waiters are mimes and, of course, the amplifier that goes up to 11. This is not, however, the easiest film to get through. Innovative as Rob Reiner's choice to shoot the film as a mockumentary no doubt is, the content soon grows repetitive with the band members saying one dumb thing after another, whether it be professing that spontaneous combustion in humans exists or stating that the insides of a human body look green and blue. Much better dark humour comes in the form of a running gag in which it is gradually revealed that dozens of drummers in the band have died in mysterious circumstances over the years, with the band's current drummer claiming that ""the law of averages"" should keep him safe (!) - and yet, the focus here is always on the ridiculous things the band members say and the misfortunes they experience along the way. Along such lines, the film pokes sharply at the notion that talent and intelligence are not always aligned in life, but whether this dynamic is enough to sustain the film is debatable. Certainly, the film has a hardy fan-base with some regarding it as one of the funniest films ever made, and as it is often said, comedy is the most subjective genre out there. This is a worthwhile movie, but probably best appreciated by those keenly interested in rock music.",This Is Spinal Tap

41,eddie_baggins,A classic fake Rock-Doco deserving of it's cult status,8,17 February 2014,"This is Spinal Tap is so entrenched into popular and movie culture that it feels like there is nothing new to say about this joyous and quite frankly awesome mocumentary that without a doubt would be more true to the facts that many would care to pay mention to. What can be said about Spinal Tap is if you have not yet partaken in its journey to the depths of a band keeping it's head barely above water seek it out today.Doing things previously un-thought of the team behind Spinal Tap fully inhabited there over the top characters to the point of many not actually knowing if the men clad in tight spandex and flowing hair were in fact real or fake. The length the group went to to inhabit these characters is not dissimilar to a Sacha Baron Coen effort of actually melting into their creation and becoming the character. Look no further than Nigel Tufnel (played fantastically by future director Guest) showing off his guitar and amp collection or one single look at Derek Smalls beard for proof of this. These fantastic and committed performances would be nothing however if the Spinal Tap band were not ready to rock your socks off.Spinal Tap features many a performance by the band each offering up a raucous and energetic rendition of their hit songs from ""Tonight I'm Gonna Rock You Tonight"" through to ""Big Bottom"", these gig set pieces are highlights of the film from the fantastically staged ""Pod"" appearance, the Stonehenge money shot or the bands playing of an Army Airbase with air traffic control interference all are laugh out loud funny moments and give the film a vibe that cannot be faked. The film also however reveals in smaller moments from band manager Ian's obsession with having a cricket bat or a party catered for by waiters dressed as mimes (spot the Billy Crystal cameo here), these are but a few examples of the film working on many different comedic levels.Holding firm today with its reputation as one of the all-time funniest movies, This is Spinal Tap will forever be a career peak for all involved.

44,Movie_Muse_Reviews,The gold standard of the modern mockumentary,9,12 July 2017,"Arguably the father, and for sure the gold standard of the modern mockumentary, ""This Is Spinal Tap"" showed audiences how razor fine the line can be between truth and hilarious fiction. A satire of '70s rock 'n roll bands, the film is hysterical because of how closely it resembles a real rock band and mirrors many truths about the music industry.With a script largely driven by improvisation from stars Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, Harry Shearer and Rob Reiner (who also directs), ""Spinal Tap"" relies on this talent pool to create an entertaining product. The film consists of little more than interviews between Reiner's ""director"" Marty DiBergi and band members David St. Hubbins (McKean), Nigel Tufnel (Guest) and Derek Smalls (Shearer), footage from their American tour and some candid conversations. What makes the story interesting is not what happens, but the character dynamics/interpersonal drama.Merely the scenario that Spinal Tap is a band in the twilight of its career, with its popularity at an all time low, creates enough opportunities for tension and movement in the story. With all of this comes creative differences, blame and flaring tempers. All these elements are true of rock bands enduring difficult times and that framework successfully guides the characters' quirkiness.The music is also a big part of why the film works. The cast members are actual musicians with a great degree of talent, which creates authenticity, to the point that Spinal Tap could actually be a band. This is an entertaining and believable act, and what happens to them, though to the point of being amusing, also falls well within the realm of likelihood. The classic miscommunication about the Stonehenge stage prop is hysterical, but in this quiet, reasonable, almost graceful way.Subtlety is really the hallmark of ""This Is Spinal Tap"" and its cast. Once a mockumentary film starts to lean too hard on hilarious scenarios, it starts to bleed over into the genre of situational comedy, and that's when you start to think less about the veracity of what you're watching as an audience and more about the writing. A great documentary never becomes so transparent that you can see its ""script,"" and the same holds true of effective mockumentaries. ""Spinal Tap"" is genius because you can rarely see the comedy cogs at work — they emerge naturally from a talented cast that had a brilliant idea.~Steven CThanks for reading!

45,Anonymous_Maxine,Hilarious documentary (rockumentary? Mockumentary?) of the awful and naïve metal band.,9,6 May 2001,"This Is Spinal Tap is a very funny look at the durable rock group Spinal Tap. The documentary style filmmaking, mostly handheld, makes it look even more realistic, and makes the band's antics that much more amusing. The film's slim plot is punctuated by interviews with individual band members (some of the funniest parts of the movie), as well as music videos and live performances of the band's god-awful music. No matter how bad their reputation or their sales or their popularity is, they just keep pressing on, assuming that things will pick up soon, and it is an endless source of amusement watching them rationalize their dropping success rate and coming up with reasons that the band should stay together. This is not Oscar winning material. Not by a long shot. None of the actors in the film were well known when it was made, nor are any of them famous today, but the uniqueness and effectiveness of the comedy and of the film as a whole make it worth while. Fans of all kinds of music, not just metal, can enjoy this very funny comedy.",This Is Spinal Tap
46,hellraiser7,Heavy Metal Fools,10,23 March 2015,"Part of what makes comedy great is that it is truthfulness but in a comical and exaggerated tone, which makes it both relatable but also joyful at the same time to take in. This is not just one of my favorite comedies but also one of my favorite films in general. I remember when I was a kid I actually thought this was a real heavy metal rock band, though the fake band did have a few albums and do some real tours for a while if you can believe that.This is my favorite film from Rob Reiner, it was the first film or at least one of the first films that created the comedy subgenere mockumentry which didn't entirely caught on till at lot latter with TV shows like ""The Office (UK and US versions)"", ""Parks and Recretation"", and ""Reno 911"". To me this was a brilliant idea the combo of both the comedy and documentary genre, the beauty of this is how in a way it's sort of a blurring the line with both reality and non reality, but also a way of simply keeping comedy along with comedic characters within reality.The film parodies but also homages and a bit of a love letter to the music scene, from the heavy metal bands but most notably ""The Bettles"". The cinematography is great it's pretty much the documentary style, it really felt like we weren't watching a movie so much but an actually documentary, it really almost looked as though this band might have existed. The music is great, it's memorable, fun and actually funny when you think about the content.But of course the three Spinal Tap band members are just fraking hilarious, all three of them are practically dorks and well fools but in a good way. They pretty much like kids or teenagers that dress up cool and try to act cool and yet they aren't. The band isn't really that good at what they do; even though their songs are fun, in the real life Heavy Metal world I wouldn't exactly call them slammin classics. My favorite song is ""Hellhole"" if you listen to the whole song or seen the music video on it, it is one big contradiction as if the person who wrote it might have changed his mind while he wrote part of the middle and end of the song, or someone else stepped in and wrote those parts at the last minute.All three mainly Nigel and David can be a bit childish sometimes like in one scene that cracks me up was when Nigel complains about having finger food bread instead of full sliced bread because he simply can't fold a piece; did it ever occur to him to simply stop at a grocery store and buy a loaf.Yet you really like all three band members and even care about them because their hearts are in the right place, if not their heads. These are people that have a dream/s but most importantly just want to do what they love play music.Even like the manager Ian, whom is dryly hilarious. I really like how gruff he really is and just how much grief he sometimes receives from the band as he is trying to coop with what demands some of them have and making things work despite rolling his eyes a bit in the process. This is an easy attitude to emphasize with if you ever were a manager and there was an amount of chaos or uncoroporation you had to deal with. I even like the fact that he has a cricket bat which despite random I thought was a funny quark to him, he uses it as a way to remind him of his roots and also vent some frustration.The dialog the characters have along with Ian is great, this film just so rich in verbal humor that you would have to see more than once to uncover more. Even some of the visual humor is great, my favorite was seeing the cover art of each of their albums which is deliciously bad and I feel a beautiful combo of both visual and verbal humor together.What I also like is that there is some truth in the film, from little things like a scene where the band gets lost trying to find the main stage which is true, it would really help if those back auditoriums had a visual directory because their real big and easy to get lost in. Even that worst fear all bands and performers carry, on things going wrong we see actually do for Spinal Tap, like the Stonehenge concert which well lets just say made, rock history.Spinal Tap rocks, well sort of.Rating: 4 stars",This Is Spinal Tap

Norman Lear must have rubbed off during his days on the set of that classic series. Here we have a documentarian, Marty DiBergi(Reiner), following Spinal Tap, a rock band, as they tour to promote their latest album, Smell the Glove. Two childhood buddies, David(Michael McKean) and Nigel(Christopher Guest) are the founders of the group, and they tell Marty of their journey to rock and roll fame. The third man to join them is bass player, Derek (Harry Shearer). The drummers have died in a series of unusual deaths, including spontaneous combustion on stage, and an unexplained gardening accident. The three lead actors are hilarious, and the script, right on target. The funniest moment for me is when Marty is interviewing guitarist Nigel about his amplifier, and the musician explains that his amplifier has a knob which goes to eleven. Asked why not just make eleven the number ten, the rock man looks bewildered, as he says that he sometimes need the higher number for that little extra. The foursome is shown playing to smaller and smaller crowds, as their album tanks. They come up with all kinds of schemes to increase ticket sales. The music is awful, reminding me of Kiss; all stage gimmicks, to cover up a lack of talent. Riner gets it right.",This Is Spinal Tap
48,Polaris_DiB,The retirement of the era,6,5 August 2011,"Tonight I finally saw This is Spinal Tap for the first time, after years of knowing what I was missing and having to stave off people's incredulity that I'd have the audacity to have not gotten around to a classic. Actually, quite a lot of funny coincidences, from scratched discs to changed syllabi, got between me and experiencing this movie. Nevertheless, it is done, and all the jokes I've heard a million times I got to see in their original form.But that's not what this review is about.One thing that struck me about this movie is that yes, if I had been watching this on, say, VH-1 without a clue as to what I was watching in advance, I would have thought it was real. Fine, that's mockumentary. However, the reason why it works best is how it basically cuts straight through to the typical, clichéd rock drama of the VH-1 special genre, which makes this to me a little bit more than, say, Airplane style parody where the the whole thing is just set-up for sight gags, Mel Brooks' farces, or Shaun of the Dead loving parody/homages: it's almost an instructional video on how it's time to retire that story.It's ironic then that this movie actually generated real live shows and it ends with a ""Spinal Tap will live on"" message, because it really seems most like it's pointing out how the rock doc has lost all its legs. A lot is laid on the age of the band members not only to emphasize their own mortality, but the feeling is almost as if the idea itself is in its forties and already ready to retire. Or maybe it just feels like that almost thirty years after this movie came out, sixty years from the point in which these documentaries started getting made.Anyway, the only other Christopher Guest penned movie I've seen is Best in Show, which I found far funnier (I have to admit I'm full of schadenfreude), but this one was a lot sadder. Might as well been called This is The End.This is Spinal Tap is sort of like an instructional video rock documentarists should watch to see how rock documentaries should no longer be made.—PolarisDiB",This Is Spinal Tap

Famous bits like Christopher Guest's ""this one goes to eleven"" have been played to death but still elicit smiles, while deeper cuts, such as the band's reaction to contemporary critics or their infamous Stonehenge performance, land as if they were brand new. And the music is great, too, not just as a cutting satire, but as a convincing love letter to the days when power rock was all the rage and flocks of buzzed, well-feathered teens would still pack a stadium to hear the loudest noise on the planet. An enduring masterpiece.",This Is Spinal Tap
50,GiraffeDoor,An antagonistically tedious and lazy movie,1,9 March 2019,"I hate this movie. It gives no impression any effort went into any of it.It feels made up on the spot because it is; they decided on scenarios and improvized. Not in the cool spontaneous way like in Creep 2, but in a cheap ""let's just half-ass this movie"" type of way. It's very insulting.Some of the jokes have potential. But they all miscarry because there obviously isn't the comic timing to pull them off. A lot of the jokes don't even make sense. Why shouldn't they put an 11 on the scale? Either stress that they know that it doesn't increase the maximum volume or respect that more intermediate settings is useful to them as musicians. The scenes, dialogue and jokes show no imagination. They seem to have been going for a hoax movie. But what's the point of that? Just watch a real rockumentary.It does not parody or satire. It just checks a list of things rockstars have done and does them. It just rips off reality. It really expects you to laugh at them ripping up small bread. I think it's meant to be a point about how rockstars can be divas but please try and be more creative. Asking to have all the green gummy bears removed: now that's what I'm talking about.And those drawling, ugly British voices... I'm British myself and I hate it.In terms of how it all adds up scene for scene I'm tempted to say there is no movie I hate more than this. At least ""in Search of the Titanic"" is so bad its good and was ballsy enough to be far out with a lot of weird scenes. This movie gives me nothing but a couple of good songs, hence why I gave it a 1 instead of a zero.Apparently its very on the money if you know rock history. But so what? Even if this movie is esoteric, Robot Chicken does a great job of making the joke clear even if you haven't seen the show they're parodying.I don't mind people liking stupid movies but telling me that this has anything smart about it just annoys me. I struggle to see how anyone can like this. This makes Judd Apatow look like Seth Macfarlane. It's not clever. It's not well observed. It's an artistically incompetent exercise in self-indulgence for the easily pleased rockthusiast.Gruellingly tedious to sit through.",This Is Spinal Tap
51,iquine,Deadpan Rocker Jokes,8,28 September 2017,"(Flash Review)This is an amusingly accurate satire on rock musicians and their inner circle; 80's hair band style. The story follows a once popular rock bad and how they deal with their vanishing popularity and influence. The film's comedic details are spot on as they mock things from band member's lack of intelligence, performance snafus, corny lyrics, silly arguments and much more. This is all done from a documentary perspective, or what known as a mockumentary, so it has the feel of realism. This approach is a relief from the modern immature and physical comedy all too common today. It is subtle and witty and if you are paying attention some gags will sneak by you. Funny but Best In Show still takes the cake for me.",This Is Spinal Tap
52,slokes,Band On The Run,9,13 January 2004,"The gritty, unpretty reality of rock music is on display in director Marty DiBergi's unsparing rockumentary ""This Is Spinal Tap,"" which chronicles the British metal band's tour through the United States in the latter part of 1982.Cold sores, drugs, late-night debauchery, and the brutal snubbing of a Sinatra-loving chauffeur are just some of the antics on display, in what could be the most penetrating and uncensored examination of the rock n' roll lifestyle since ""Gimme Shelter."" Whereas that movie features one grainy, out-of-focus killing, this film actually shows the band's drummer spontaneously combusting on stage! And apparently this was the second time that happened (or maybe I'm thinking of the drummer they lost to an unexplained gardening accident, I'm a little unclear.)DiBergi hasn't made a movie since ""Spinal Tap,"" which is a shame. No chance he'll make a sequel though. In the 2000-issue DVD, band members Nigel Tufnel, David St. Hubbins, and Derek Smalls make clear that they feel betrayed by DiBergi's work, calling it ""a hatchet job"" and hinting that his jealousy about not being the sixth band member caused him to show only the band's bad side. For example, we see in the movie Spinal Tap backstage at Cleveland's legendary Xanadu Star Theater wandering fruitlessly through a warren of back corridors trying to find their way onto the stage. Nine times out of ten the band found their way on stage without problem, as they point out on the commentary track, but DiBergi has to show the one time they don't.Murphy's Law seems to predominate elsewhere, too, like when Nigel's back gives out in the middle of a blistering solo, or Derek is trapped in a giant peapod prop for an entire song. Viewers of a particularly cruel disposition may even find some cause for amusement when a misunderstanding in Austin, Texas leads to the band performing their legendary number ""Stonehenge"" in front of a model of the ancient monument that barely comes up to the drummer's kit. Maybe they could have gotten away with it if they didn't let the dwarfs come onstage and dance alongside it, but the result, as St. Hubbins notes, is almost ""a comedy number, and I didn't bloody appreciate being part of the comedy.""The band struggles on, and perceptive viewers may detect a slight note of friction between Tufnel and Jeanine, St. Hubbins's girlfriend, for example when Tufnel throws his guitar down on stage, stares at Jeanine accusingly for a minute, and then quits the band. Misogynists will say Jeanine is the kind of rock wife that 'puts the yoke in Yoko,' but they shallowly ignore her tambourine-playing, or her fearless use of red satin as a pant fabric.Admittedly, Jeanine is less on point as a manager, as an early gig under her control at an amusement park finds them billed under their opening act. 'If I told them once, I told them a thousand times,' she muses. 'Put the band's name first, puppet show after.'But the band soldiers on, and by the end, you will be glad you stuck around, too, rough as it is to see the harshness on screen. It's the kind of documentary that demands periods of quiet reflection to take it all in, to register the pain, sweat, and unpleasant odors behind the entertainment we too often take for granted on the radio.Sadly, the film doesn't feature a complete version of Spinal Tap standards 'Hell Hole' or the big-in-Japan 'Sex Farm.' We do get a full-throated version of the classic 'Big Bottom,' a power ballad which examines the seat of female beauty with a wry Steely Dan-type lyrical subtlety: 'Big Bottom/Big Bottom/Talk about mud flaps/My girl's got 'em.'Why don't they make songs like that any more? I give this film a 9 out of 10, but with the DVD commentary, you gotta boost that to 11. Rock on, Tap!",This Is Spinal Tap
53,caspian1978,The greatest Moc-umentary of all time,8,22 July 2004,"Reiner took a chance with McKean and Guest to produce a ""movie"" that had never been made before. The idea was not only different but took a lot of people to convince it could work. One by one, actors came out to support the film by doing cameos. Billy Crystal, Paul Schaffer, and several other SNL connected stars came out to add their own touch of genius to the project. In the end, you get proof that McKean and Guest are two of the most under appreciated actors / writers of the 80's and 90's. Their fresh brand of comedy has produced some of the most funniest moments in movies and television. This is Spinal Tap remains one of the most original and creative films ever produced in the comedy genre. 20 years later, the film has gained a giant following of devoted fans and comedy writers who have tried to steal from its uniqueness.",This Is Spinal Tap
54,Jonny_Numb,"no classic, but a fine send-up nonetheless...",6,2 February 2006,"""This is Spinal Tap"" is the granddaddy of the 'mockumentary' subgenre (consisting of an admittedly small group of films), and like an elder, it has aged in ways both positive and negative. The script, by Christopher Guest (""Waiting for Guffman""; ""Best in Show""), Michael McKean, Harry Shearer (""The Simpsons""), and Rob Reiner (who also directed) shows an astute knowledge of the behind-the-scenes world of rock music whilst amplifying the excesses of the lifestyle with satiric gusto. The film is awash in early-80s glamour, neon, cheesy yet catchy musical interludes, and ostentatious Van Halen hairdos. Clocking in at 83 minutes, ""Spinal Tap"" breezes by quickly enough, but the gags often feel too spaced-out and too subtle for their own good...while this helps the ersatz-documentary aspect, the comedy suffers a little. Despite this, ""Spinal Tap"" is a highly entertaining item with some wickedly funny scenes (the dwarfs dancing around a miniature mock-up of Stonehenge is priceless), and remains relevant today as a tongue-in-cheek portrait of the excesses of the music world.",This Is Spinal Tap
55,rbverhoef,Cult classic,9,14 October 2004,"By many seen as the favorite cult classic (together with 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show') 'This is Spinal Tap' is truly a comedy masterpiece. The rockumentary about fake band Spinal Tap seems so honest and serious that the slightest joke gets a huge laugh. We follow the band together with a documentary filmmaker, played by director Rob Reiner, on a tour that must make sure they will have a comeback. We see some of their shows where things go wrong, we see how they argue about the cover of their album, and we see how a girlfriend almost destroys the band.The movie handles all these events as serious as possible, presenting itself as a real documentary about a real band. The fact that the band members are not too bright makes it funny. Especially the scene where the lead singer talks about an amplifier that goes to eleven instead of ten and therefore produces louder sounds is hilarious. The scene where the band plays on a Stonehenge stage is a classic, very memorable.Writer Christopher Guest recently wrote and starred in 'Best in Show' (2000) and 'A Mighty Wind' (2003), two hilarious and terrific fake documentaries, the so-called mockumentaries, but 'This is Spinal Tap' stays the classic example. He and his co-writers, including director Reiner, have created the ultimate cult classic.",This Is Spinal Tap
56,Sandcooler,The simplicity of a gardening accident,10,2 April 2008,"I have no idea why, but this could be the funniest thing I've ever seen. Spinal Tap is cult, and despite being in ludicrous situations all the time, I think they also quite accurately show us how a rock band works, like a talented version of KISS. The bizarre thing is that the music they play is actually very good. It's like they found some leftover rock clichés and made something good of them. The focus is mostly on fake behind the scenes footage though, that classic scene where they can't find the stage anymore always does the trick for me. I also love when they get a sneak preview of their album cover and it's just entirely black. And then there are about a hundred other moments. This is one of the few movies I prefer to see alone because seriously if I have to explain they're not an actual band one more time my head is going to explode and lava will gush out.

57,Chase_Witherspoon,It was a rock 'n' roll creation,10,13 May 2012,"The soundtrack itself is stand alone (satirical) brilliance, before we even delve into the mockumentary of the fictitious British band whose speakers are so loud, they go to eleven. Reiner's documentary style film follows the band on its tour of the USA, as they traverse the country playing to half empty houses, experiencing myriad crises (e.g. band members leaving, shows being cancelled) and minor debacles (e.g. the appetisers and set work). Their struggle to deliver a unique brand despite the critics scorn is nothing short of heroic.The principal trio (McKean, Guest and Shearer) are pitch perfect as no-brain rockers with dim ideas and infantile (yet still potent) lyrics (""big bottom, big bottom, talk about mud flaps my girl's got 'em""), led around by their faithful manager (Hendra) enduring every ignominy a touring band could experience from getting lost en route to the stage via the green room to the bass player becoming locked inside a cocoon as part of an act. Director Reiner plays the band's documenter, Patrick MacNee has a cameo as a promoter and Fran Drescher, Billy Crystal, Bruno Kirby, Ed Begley Jnr, Howard Hesseman and Paul Schaefer all have bit parts.Highlights include the Stonehenge ""malfunction"", Guest's discussion with the director about the tempo of his speakers and the band's frank confessions about their sexual promiscuity (""we've got armadillos down our trousers, it's truly frightening"").

58,brando647,The Best Band to Have Never Existed,8,3 March 2009,"I'm going to avoid making the obligatory ""goes to 11"" joke in this comment, hehe...This movie has become a comedy classic. The film is a mockumentary about the worst (greatest?) heavy metal band to have never existed: Spinal Tap. My friend introduced me to the film when he discovered I'd never seen it, immediately demanding I give it a viewing. I'm glad he did, as this is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. The entire film is played as a real documentary as it follows the band on tour in America to promote a new album and we get a glimpse into the small minds of the band.The movie is directed by Rob Reiner, who also has a part in the movie as documentarian and Spinal Tap fan, Marty DiBergi. The band's key members are the comedy team of Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer. These guys were AMAZING; most of the movie was filmed unscripted with improvised lines and these guys were hilarious (for further proof, listen to the character commentary on the special edition DVD). In addition to the humor, the film also has some pretty addicting music. The film's stars all played their own instruments and did their own vocals, and they sound great. I can't tell you how long I had ""Tonight I'm Gonna Rock You Tonight"" stuck in my head after watching this film.I can understand how people became confused and believed Spinal Tap to be a real bad; it almost had me believing it until I realized the lead singer was Michael McKean. The film is played completely straight-faced and that only makes it funnier when the band encounters a myriad of problems on the road; the scene backstage when Nigel is discussing his food selections with Ian Faith (the manager, Tony Hendra) is hilarious. Those who haven't yet seen Reiner's film are missing out on this cult classic.Watching this film again, I really wish the three actors would get together for a little reunion tour....",This Is Spinal Tap

Why, this is a true thing - many bands have fallen victims of similar misadventures - lost backstage, lost with props, lost with song list, lost with band members changes, lost with sound, lost with managers, lost with sense of humor. And the immortal These go to eleven moment is simply The Top. As well as the famous cocoon section with poor bassist trapped inside. Very funny, very wild and riveting.

And frankly, considering all that has come to past in rock and roll, it seems a little tame, even a little on the lame side. Or perhaps I have grown too jaded. Since Rob Reiner dreamed up this ""pseudo-rockumentary"" (after affixing some gold paint strategically on the USS Coral Seas baseball cap he wears--one of the many sight gags in the movie) the satirical assault on rock culture as been done and done again, perhaps a time or two too many.The music itself is, shall we say, derivative with the Stones, some early Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Queen, and others having some distant unavoidable influence, while the unwashed antics of the stars both on stage and off have become clichés of the biz. Worse yet, satirizing the documentary mode itself has been done to death.Alas, can we have back those moments of splendor in the grass (Wordsworth) or when we first leaned back in the movie theater, the smell of rancid popcorn butter in our nose, and sticky soda corn syrup on the soles of our shoes, and got blasted away by Spinal Tap? No, Virginia, you can't go home again, sad to say.Might as well jump (Van Halen, 1984).(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

63,sme_no_densetsu,"""It's such a fine line between stupid and clever""",8,22 November 2008,"""This is Spinal Tap"" is a cult classic and the epitome of 'mockumentary' film-making. We are shown the sights, sounds and smells of fictional band Spinal Tap as they embark on a North American tour that keeps going from bad to worse with poor reception and internal problems.The cast is a pretty good one and the 'band' members (Michael McKean, Christopher Guest & Harry Shearer) actually played their own instruments. Of course, in a film like this you want realism rather than acting prowess and I must say that most of the cast performs well in this regard.The plot (what little of it there is) is filled with humorous escapades and memorable quotes. The humour is often subtle enough that it will fly under the radar of some viewers. As for realism, the fact that so many musicians have remarked on the film's veracity should give an indication of the writers' knowledge of their subject.On the directorial front, Rob Reiner does a good job of fashioning this film like a true documentary. A more polished approach would not have worked nearly as well. When people are confused about whether or not this is a real documentary you know that Reiner has hit his mark. The music is also enjoyable, particularly since it so adroitly imitates the real thing.I recommend this film but for me there's still something missing. There are countless memorable scenes and quotes but the film as a whole lacks cohesiveness and a strong story.

Fortunately, the songs were well-written and performed. Otherwise, I would have been mostly bored.

Who are the members of the AFI?  I'd like to have a word with them.  This pseudo-documentary/pseudo-comedy starts out with a few funny gags, scattered here and there.  But in the second and third acts, when the band goes downhill, the comedy becomes as soggy as a wet rag.  The gags are so slight and cheap.  We're stuck with bland gags, like the one about the tiny sandwiches in the dressing room.  Wow, is that a classic moment or what!!! Just one bland gag after another.  Even though the running time was a mere 83 minutes, I found it tedious and lagging.  This is one of those comedies I have to watch with someone to actually find which moments are supposed to be funny.  I probably still won't get a laugh, but at least I'll have more of an understanding.  Is this film true to the world of rock and roll, and does it have a satirical bite?  I don't know.  Maybe.  Whatever it was, it sure as hell wasn't interesting.  I don't know much about rock and roll, as far the behind-the-scenes stuff goes, but I don't care what happens off-stage if it's going to be this boring.

68,classicalsteve,This Mockumentary-Rockumentary May Be Guest's Best Effort Poking Fun at Heavy Metal Rock Music Culture,8,5 September 2017,"""This is Spinal Tap"" was Christopher Guest's first foray into so-called ""mockumentary"", a comedic genre in which satire and farce are presented in the form of a documentary film focusing on a fictional subject. One of the first of the genre was ""Take the Money and Run"" written, directed and starring Woody Allen. Spinal Tap is a fictional heavy metal rock band originating from Britain, a cross between ""The Who"", ""Alice Cooper"", ""Black Sabbath"", and ""Def Leppard"". The font used for the name on film posters and other media paraphernalia are similar to those used by many heavy metal bands popular during the late 1970's and 1980's, often of a neo-medieval/Gothic style. Rob Reiner, who directs, plays a fictional documentary/commercial filmmaker who presents a behind-the-scenes exposé of a rock band whose loudness and punctuality are of legendary status.""This is Spinal Tap"" pokes fun at some of the ""rockumentaries"" which were in vogue in the 1980's, giving audiences and fans glimpses into the behind-the-scenes world of famous rock bands. This mockumentary-rockumentary lampoons such documentaries such as VH1's ""Behind the Music"" with a satirical harpoon large enough to catch the likes of Ozzie Osbourne, Ronnie James Dio, Tony Iommi, Joe Elliot and a host of other heavy metal musicians in one swoop. Marty Di Bergi, the fictional documentary filmmaker played by Rob Reiner gives a short introduction to the film dedicated to the band he first saw at a place called ""The Electric Banana"" in Greenwich Village during the 1960's, which, he explains doesn't exist any more. (If he didn't say that, you know some heavy metal groupies would be looking for it.) The film is a series of bits including interviews with groupies, fans, promoters, producers, and of course the band members. On-stage chicanery and behind-the-scenes mayhem become the cornerstone from which ""This is Spinal Tap"" emerges. Christopher Guest plays the lead guitarist Nigel ""Tuffy"" Tufnel, a Birmingham, England bloke with a heavy working-class cockney accent sporting a hairstyle like late Beatles and The Who. His character is a cross between Joe Elliott of Def Leppard, Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin, and the late Randy Rhoades of Ozzy. David St. Hubbins played by Michael McKean, is the lead singer and rhythm guitarist of the band. His character seems to be based on David Lee Roth when he was lead singer for Van Halen and Steve Clark, rhythm guitarist of Def Leppard. A short clip of the band's ""early years"" in black and white out-of-focus video with the band in bland suits and jackets with the trademark elevated drummer sets the stage for much of the silliness which follows. Only two bands which continued from the 1960's and into the 1980's which could have looked like that and play the kind of heavy metal in vogue in the 1980's would be The Who and maybe The Rolling Stones. The bands they lampoon largely came into existence during the 1970's.Many of the bits are actually not as over-the-top as you might believe because of the chaos which haunts heavy metal musicians, both in terms of off-stage buffoonery and on-stage antics. In one memorable bit, the band is singing their newly-composed hit ""Stonehenge"" and a replica of one of the stones is lowered onstage--but it's not quite as dramatic as it should be! Another is when Guest shows Reiner his collection of guitars and amps. All amps in the industry go up to a maximum of 10 in terms of volume, but Spinal Tap's amps go up to 11! ""That's '1' louder!"" proclaims Guest.If you know anything about the heavy metal and pop music scene and would like a no-holds-barred satire about that Alice-in-Wonderland world, this is definitely for you. By the mid-to-late 1970's heavy metal rock bands, spear-headed by the likes of Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath garnered huge followings in Europe and North America. They became so-called ""super-groups"" and were the voices of late Boomers and early Generation X'ers who enjoyed wearing black and other non-conformist clothing, riding motorcycles and taking recreational drugs. They were in a sense the next evolution in rebellious youth making the hippies of a half-generation earlier seem tame by comparison. ""This is Spinal Tap"" pokes fun at this world but not in a disparaging way. However, if you believe these people should be placed on pedestals and worshipped like Gods, ""This is Spinal Tap"" might bring you up from your knees. In a real-life story, Ozzy Osbourne was once asked about his house burning down. He replied he wanted to know if beer was flammable! And yes it is! This could have been a scene in ""This is Spinal Tap"" but actually it wasn't!",This Is Spinal Tap
69,sharky_55,These go to eleven.,9,15 August 2016,"Film-maker Marty DeBergi has assigned himself a mission to investigate the inner lives of the rock band Spinal Tap, who he is drawn to not because of their lyrical poetry or their composition but because they can lay claim to being one of the loudest bands in Britain. Marty is played by Rob Reiner himself and is the crucial building block of his debut mockumentary. He wields his camera with sincerity, honesty and authenticity, and seems to hold the same qualities in his face, letting the inevitable mayhem of the band happen before his eyes. Reiner is a great comedic actor; he knows when to nod politely, and when to feign modest interest (almost always), and throughout the entire journey does not ever relinquish his poker face even slightly. His seriousness lends legitimacy to his capturing of the rogue band, and makes it all the more funny when they break from convention.The genius of the film is in how little effort Marty has put to in to get any decent material for his documentary. He points the camera, offers a few probing questions, and Spinal Tap do the rest. Through the simple verite style presentation there is the suggestion of a wilder, greater life that these musicians occupy off the screen, and how lucky for Marty to be able to capture even a little insight. They are larger than life itself, and even in the mundane they pop. Some of the humour comes from Reiner simply extending the documentary's boundaries, and pretending as if this was a completely normal venture. Marty asks, very solemnly, if the current Spinal Tap drummer Mick Shrimpton is afraid of the unfortunate fate of all the previous drummers, and Mick replies in turn, with all seriousness, that it was a legitimate issue that was discussed between them, as if he was talking about a missing tom- tom. Oh, and he's in the bathtub. Reiner also draws from another rather famous British band, in both style and content, and in a way that immediately produces contrast. A Hard Day's Night was one of the early mockumentaries that birthed an entire genre, and crafted a whole set of rules and guidelines from which concert films were to be made. They are all noticeably here, and Reiner freely exaggerates: the push-ins to the band's orgasmic expressions, the reaction shots of the (less than) ecstatic audience, the way the camera hurtles through backstage trying desperately to keep up with the mania of the crew. When Tufnel storms off in disgust after a particularly terrible show, see how we are immediately chasing after him, the frame bouncing with each step, and pausing for the full gravitas of the ugly stare-down. Who is causing the rift in Spinal Tap? None other than the Yoko Ono of their time, an earth- loving hippie who increasingly pushes her unwanted presence into the band's affairs. But Spinal Tap have been there and done that - their early, drug-fuelled hit (Listen To The) Flower People must be as flabbergasting as Lennon's I Am The Walrus. McKean, Guest and the rest of Spinal Tap are wild in the best way, given free reign to go haywire. They tap into a very specific and familiar persona of the rock star and all the glamorous, egocentric pretensions that come along with their music, and all the drama, backlash and toxic infighting that brings about their inevitable downfall (and comeback tour). All this, as the laws dictate, must be well publicised, and Reiner observes ever so diligently. The band is pompous, fired up from their brief success and thinking that no artistic boundary is beyond them. They hastily deflect any accusations or criticisms because such things are below their level. The critics may have been right - the White Album did have nothing on its cover, but even that is not so absurd as the excessively graphic content of Smell the Glove. Their other albums have similarly humorous titles. Some are simply two phrases stuck together - Shark Sandwich, Robotic Armchair, Cerebral Badger. You get the idea.They think themselves poets, and resort to more and more desperation in order to win back their audience. Reiner produces his funniest scenes when he points towards just how insecure and vulnerable Spinal Tap really are. When challenged on the fact that most of their fans are clueless teenage boys, they retort that it is their primal masculinity that draws the envy (and fear) of both sexes. Later, a timid Derek Smalls is caught with a tinfoil- wrapped cucumber in his pants, left standing there humiliated. The climax is the reveal of the tiny Stonehenge statue, derailed by a hastily drawn napkin diagram. Reiner doesn't stray an inch; he shows the conventional shots, the passion, the feverish crowd, the dazzling lights, and then just lowers the model and lets Spinal Tap react and fall apart. And yet they are not arrogant to the point of dislike. We chuckle as they get second billing to a puppet show, and feel a little sorry when things out of their control cripple their last ditch efforts. So when Tufnel bursts back onto the stage for the teary reunion, we laugh at the sheer absurdity of the timing of it all, but at the same time we are also cheering them on and lining up for the comeback tour.",This Is Spinal Tap
70,jhclues,"Reiner ""Taps"" Into Something Special",9,2 October 2000,"An aging, fading British rock group is touring America, and on hand to document the occasion is a filmmaker who has been blown away by their sound since the first time he heard them; and the result is offered up here for the perusal of all, in `This Is Spinal Tap,' without question the best feature length parody of a rock band ever made, directed by Rob Reiner. When the band returns to the U.S. to promote their latest album, `Smell The Glove,' director Marty DiBergi (Reiner)  accompanies them on tour, conducting interviews and taping performances, in an effort to get it all down for posterity.  And get it all he does; the highs and lows, the drama and pathos, the words, wisdom and witticisms of this legendary rock group. It's all here, and we owe it all to a man of incredible intuition, imagination and foresight, Marty DiBergi.  But, with all seriousness aside, folks... 	When this film was released in 1984, it was fresh and new, cutting edge satire that seemed almost outrageous and scathingly intemperate; and to some extent, it still does today.  The difference now, however, is that the times have caught up to and surpassed the parody of the movie.  By anyone's standards, much of this film now seems quite tame, though the subject of the satire remains every bit as relevant today as it did then.  The interviews, conducted and delivered with such dry humor and subtle wit, readily withstand the test of time and are as funny now as ever; but the songs, especially the lyrics, pale now somewhat in the wake of such acts as Marilyn Manson, Rob Zombie, Slipknot, Monster Magnet, System Of A Down, Coal Chamber, Pantera and Alice In Chains (just to mention a few), all of whom in reality have gone far beyond the parameters set by Spinal Tap.  And with today's accessibility to such a wide variety of groups and music via MTV, MTVX, VH-1 and all the other myriad cable connections, it's simply taken the `sting' out of the impact of the film.  Like science fiction that has become science fact, our culture and society has contextually changed it's frame of reference, which of course must change the way we perceive a film like `Spinal Tap.' 	What can never change is the quality of the overall movie, the precision of the satire, and the caliber of the performances and direction.  With genuine sincerity, Reiner/DiBergi delivers a truly believable `Rockumentary.'  His pace and timing are impeccable, and his eye for detail is thorough (though much of it will be lost on today's generation).  The performances are first rate all around:  Michael McKean, totally credible as David St. Hubbins (lead guitar, vocals), possibly the best character he's ever done; Christopher Guest as Nigel Tufnel (lead guitar, vocals); Harry Shearer as Derek Smalls (bass, vocals); and, of course Reiner, who'is' DeBergi.  Also turning in notable performances are Bruno Kirby (Tommy Pischedda), R.J. Parnell (Mick Shrimpton, drummer), David Kaff (Viv Savage, keyboards, vocals), Tony Hendra (Ian Faith), Fran Drescher (Bobbi Flekman), and Patrick Macnee (Sir Denis Eaton-Hogg).  Though it may have lost some of it's edge due to changing times, `This Is Spinal Tap' will forever remain a milestone in cinematic history.  The songs may be dated but the humor is timeless; this is top-notch satire, and the parody set the standard in the rock genre for those who followed, like Weird Al Yankovic.  The appeal of this film is going to vary from generation to generation, and it follows that the level of appreciation is going to vary; but the fact will always remain that this is a unique movie that succinctly captures the spirit and essence of an entire era.  And for that, Reiner and Co. get a tip of the hat.  I rate this one 9/10.",This Is Spinal Tap
71,rupie,sure to become a classic,8,9 July 1999,"On the chance that there's a few out there that haven't yet seen ""This is Spinal Tap"", do yourself a favor and rent this hilarious film.Directed by Rob Reiner, it is in the form of a documentary on the first North American tour of a fictitious rock band ('Spinal Tap') which is rapidly plummeting to the bottom of the charts. It has more riotously funny moments than even some of Mel Brooks stuff. My favorites - the amplifier (""but this one goes to 11""), the Stonehendge set, ""what's the name of that tune you're playing"", the airbase concert, and on and on. The dialogue is brilliantly funny, capturing perfectly the egotistical pretentiousness and intellectual vapidity of many of those in the entertainment industry. Rob Reiner himself plays the documentary film maker, and watch for cameos by Ed Begley Jr., Billy Crystal, Patrick Macnee (remember John Steed?), and Paul Shaffer.Rumor has it that the documentary style of this film was so convincing that a good many shall we say cerebrally challenged viewers thought it was real, a fact which only adds to the hilarity. As a result of this film the 'band' members (all of whom actually play) started doing actual appearances as Spinal Tap, and the big question is how many attending their concerts are aware that it's all a put on.'Spinal Tap' is going to become a classic comedy, and if you haven't seen it yet and are looking for some laughs, rent it.",This Is Spinal Tap

I hadn't seen This Is Spinal Tap for many years and and i often looked back on the film with fondness and i still do after seeing the film today but not quite as much. What is unusual about this film , and i dont often say this about films is,that it is to short at 80 minutes but having seen the DVD with all the extra scenes it is a wonder as to why this film was not made longer when originally put together. It's hard to say to much about the acting because i would presume Christopher Guest,Michael McKean, Harry Shearer and Rob Reiner ad lib a vast majority of the film and brilliant at it they are.

73,jluis1984,Behind the Music: Spinal Tap,10,23 January 2006,"In 1984, Rob Reiner was already a TV veteran, but when he did his first theatrical feature, his choice was a bit odd for a ""debut"". Along with friends Christopher Guest, Harry Shearer and Michael McKean, they crafted a monumental satire that stands out as a landmark of comedy: A documentary that shows the life of one of Britain's legendary heavy metal bands, Spinal Tap.The ""mockumentary"" follows Spinal Tap in their latest tour across the U.S. after releasing their album ""Smell the glove"". Famous Commercials Director Mary DiBergi (Rob Reiner himself) is our guide and he follows the band everywhere, from parties to concerts, and we witness the brilliant genius of Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest), David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean) and Derek Smalls (Harry Shearer), and whoever is their drummer in turn.The satire is constant an outstanding, nothing is left untouched and we have fun with all the antics of the failed rock-stars. Really, this is a work of a team, as our main characters are as real as they can be (in fact, many people thought that Spinal Tap was real). This is probably its most remarkable feature, everything is so realistic that is fun. The creative team really did an amazing job with the characters.Fans of rock n' roll will find references to everything from Eric Clapton to Kiss, from The Beatles to Black Sabbath and from Bon Jovi to Mötley Crüe. Nobody escapes from the sharp satire this movie uses. However, it is important to point out that the songs were also written by the team, and that Spinal Tap really do perform their set (they also did a real tour in-character for a while too).The acting is great, as I wrote above, the performances are very real, so real that is quite hard to believe that Spinal never existed. It's hard to give credit to only one person because the movie is the work of a team. Everyone did a great job in keeping the movie look as real as it can be, Reiner, the main stars, and the countless extras, it is a perfectly crafted ""documentary"".If a flaw can be found in the movie, is that it is really more rewarding when you are aware of the things they make fun of (specially since real rock-stars have stated that things depicted in the movie really have happened to some of them). However, this doesn't mean that you have to be a rocker to understand it; the situations are quite funny and the humor is so clever, that actually anyone will enjoy it.11/10. It is that loud.",This Is Spinal Tap
74,eminkl,An enduring masterpiece.,9,17 April 2020,"A classic, scathing lampoon of every successful rock band that's ever been guilty of taking themselves too seriously. Rob Reiner directs (and plays an important supporting role) but it seems like all he really needed to do was point a camera in the right direction, then edit several hours' worth of golden improvisational delight into a concise, intelligible ninety-minute package. It's a roaring parade of nonstop laughs, some blunt and easy, others sharp and witty. Famous bits like Christopher Guest's ""this one goes to eleven"" have been played to death but still elicit smiles, while deeper cuts, such as the band's reaction to contemporary critics or their infamous Stonehenge performance, land as if they were brand new. And the music is great, too, not just as a cutting satire, but as a convincing love letter to the days when power rock was all the rage and flocks of buzzed, well-feathered teens would still pack a stadium to hear the loudest noise on the planet.",This Is Spinal Tap

76,itamarscomix,All the way to eleven!,10,18 March 2006,"The only thing funnier than 'This Is Spinal Tap' is the people who didn't get the joke. Leafing through the reviews on Amazon and IMDb, I came upon a couple of one star reviews along the lines of 'it was an okay documentary but why make a film about this band nobody's heard of when there were lots of better bands around?' There was even one guy who, apparently attempting to appear musically educated, stated that he remembers hearing some of Spinal Tap's hits in the 70's, but they were nothing special. The fact that there are a few who failed to realize that Spinal Tap were a fictitious band, created specifically for this mockumentary, is a testament to the subtle intelligence of the humor and the preciseness of the film's parody, as well as to the dreadful overall state of mainstream rock in the late 70's and early 80's.In his first feature film, Rob 'Meathead' Reiner disguises himself as documentary maker Marty DiBergi and follows around the comeback US tour of has-been heavy metal dinosaurs Spinal Tap. Reiner did not invent the fake documentary  and I don't care what Charlie (or was it Donald?) Kaufman says, it wasn't Fellini either  the concept can be traced back to the brilliant opening scene of 'Citizen Kane' and even earlier than that  but no film prior to 'This Is Spinal Tap' was this loyal and uncompromising in its documentary structure and in its invented reality. Reiner, Guest and co. took the joke to the very limits, and it's easy to see that with the DVD bonus features, which include TV commercials made by Spinal Tap, video clips, press conferences and TV appearances from across the band's history, even an appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show.Spinal Tap are everything that was silly, trite and ridiculous about the music industry in the early 80's. In their Prima Dona behavior, their stupid quarreling, their idiotic, half-baked pseudo-philosophic wisdom, and most of all in their songs, Spinal Tap put a distorting mirror in front of half the bands that were around at the time; and any band that was insulted because they thought the joke was on them, merely proved the point. The songs use every cliché of rock music without shame, and the performances of Michael McKean, Christopher Guest and Harry Shearer as the band-mates are precise, merciless and hilarious. Best of all is Guest as virtuoso guitarist Nigel Tuffnel, who is beyond brilliant in several unforgettable scenes (including the classic 'the dials go up to eleven' routine), but is also hilarious when he doesn't say a word; his body language and facial expressions while playing on stage spoof any self-proclaimed genius guitarist of the time, and there's no need for mentioning any names.Again, what makes 'This Is Spinal Tap' great is the subtleness of the humor. Reiner and co. felt no inhibition to supply jokes by the minute as way too many comedies do, and it's an ability he proved again later in the classics 'The Princess Bride' and 'When Harry Met Sally'. The jokes in 'This Is Spinal Tap' do not overshadow the characters and the story told, but with very few actual jokes the film is still unbelievably, consistently, laugh-out-loud roll-on-the-floor funny. Especially for musicians and music lovers in general, who will immediately laugh at many of the easy to miss jokes, 'This Is Spinal Tap' is essential viewing, and one of the funniest films you'll ever see. The DVD is also great, with lost of supplemental material and wonderful deleted scenes, including several with the great Billy Crystal.",This Is Spinal Tap
77,FilmOtaku,Still hilarious after two decades,9,10 May 2004,"`This is Spinal Tap' was such a brilliant concept twenty years ago  a documentary about a fake rock band, that people thought (and some still think) that it is a `real' film.  Unlike a lot of comedies to come out of the past two decades, the humor is still relevant and still as hilarious, long after the glam-rock and hair-band phases have (blissfully) passed us by  for the most part.It's easy to categorize the primary actors by their seminal roles throughout the years, Michael McKean as Lenny, Harry Shearer as many voices on The Simpsons, and Christopher Guest as well, the guy in `Heartbeeps' I guess, but after having seen all of the Guest `mockumentaries' and revisiting `Spinal Tap' after catching bits and pieces throughout the years, their talent is undeniable.  It's also testimony to the brilliance of the writing when one realizes how many jokes and site gags are still scattered in pop culture today  there were several cases where I thought, `So THAT'S where that came from!'  `This is Spinal Tap' is one of the funniest movies I've seen in the past twenty years, a high compliment from someone who doesn't find what generally passes as `comedy' funny unless it's from a film made prior to 1965 or a film directed by Woody Allen.

Either you laugh or you don't.  The amps that go up to ""11"" is  my favourite. You have to watch it twice to catch some of the dialogue (worth checking out on this site) and see how the running gags sit together.(The fate of the various drummers is a gem.)The music itself is actually not that much better or worse than real B league rock and the only real spark of musical  inspiration is the ""flashback"" to Spinal Tap in the sixties. The central theme is ""tastelessness"" in words and music; although this is hardly new or original.Yes, this film is funny and memorable - with one or two gems - but the thing that you are left with is a lot of mini sketches, stretched around a framework of familiarity. The theme of  musicians being narcissistic, egotistic, tasteless and dim has all been done before, just not as well or with the correct budget.The final thought is how music and comedy are alike. Both can be enjoyable and make the world a better place, but you rarely learn anything or gain anything.

It's so deep in it's hilarious messages that you really have to see it three or four times to catch all of the jokes being hidden between characters, happenings and cultural satire. The movie featuring three totally talented musicians and comedians introduces you to a docu-comedy that simply can't make you laugh at rock & roll for some minutes.As the movie starts off we're at a airport and everything seems so freaking big with this band, like in big business. But Spinal Tap is truly a band in a downhill down to the rest of the loser bands playing glossy heavy metal in the 80ties. Guitarists and best friends David and Nigel seem so for-filling with metal riffs and solos that keeps pushing this ridiculous gem to the extreme, and off course lame costumes and a bassist uglier than anything else on stage.THIS IS SPINAL TAP is also one of the most influential comedies because of it's truly genius originality and off course serious joking around-as the group members so perfectly puts it themselves; such a good thing between stupid and clever. Because this isn't just a very funny movie, it's also extremely clever to put it that way - the jokes are so layered and the whole basic laughs are so well made that this movie stands as a huge rock with the rest of the top-notch comedies of all time, as Monty Python, TV-series Office, brilliant satire-zombie Shaun Of The Dead, Mr. Bean himself and Jim Carrey's pet detective to mention a few.Switching from close to dead-serious rock & roll business to pure stupidity this movie is also such a killer on entertainment. Featuring dozens of scenes that made me crack over and over; such in as Nigel wants to do a spin on the floor while doing his guitar solo, he needs help from a crew member - so funny! Or when the bassist is stuck in one of those ridiculous stage effects, or when Nigel starts complaining about the backstage food - or when they tell the mysterious stories of their dying drummers, or at the movie end when the group members tells sort of inside stories of their own view. St. David, or Nigel working as a salesman or the bassist finding himself very alike a moose.

82,Isaac5855,In My Top10 Funniest Movies Ever Made...a brilliant and hilarious send up of the world of rock and roll....,9,18 September 2007,"THIS IS SPINAL TAP is the brilliant mock documentary that chronicles the final tour of an aging rock group. This razor sharp dig at the world of rock and roll marked the directing debut of Rob Reiner and was the genesis of a rep company that would later bring us films like WAITING FOR GUFFMAN, BEST IN SHOW, and A MIGHTY WIND. Reiner appears as Marty DiBergi, a filmmaker who has decided to document the final tour of a legendary band called Spinal Tap which coincides with the release of their latest album called ""Smell the Glove."" This film provides huge laughs as we see the band deal with less than stellar box office sales, lackluster public appearances, bad reviews, and some touching moments including one scene where they hear an old song of theirs on the radio while in a hotel room and hear themselves referred to as being in the ""Where are they Now"" file. Reiner has assembled a superb cast working at the top of their form here: Michael McKean plays David St. Hubbins,lead singer and guitarist of the group; Christopher Guest practically steals the film as Nigel Tufnel, the other lead guitarist and David's childhood friend who were the nucleus of the band. Harry Shearer garners big laughs as Derek Smalls, the group's bass player. There is one funny bit after another here including bungled hotel reservations, a guitar speaker that goes to ""11"", the band's inability to find the stage from their dressing room at a concert in Cleveland, and the tension that surfaces between David and Nigel when David's girlfriend Janine joins them on the tour. Solid comic support is provided by Patric Macnee, Fran Drescher, Bruno Kirby, Tony Hendra (very funny as the band's manager), and some funny cameos by Ed Begley Jr. , Billy Crystal, and Howard Hesseman. This comedy is so accurate in its depiction of the world of rock and roll that rocker Brett Michaels of Poison has been quoted as saying he finds watching this movie an uncomfortable experience.

84,the red duchess,One of the most touching love stories of the 1980s.,9,7 December 2000,"'Spinal Tap' is a bit like 'Life of Brian'.  It is one of those films you watched a thousand times as a kid, re-enacting scenes and quoting one-liners with friends as if they expressed the meaning of life (they do).  It is impossible to be objective about, or even enjoy it as a film - it is recognition, not surprise, that now comprises the pleasure. 
Even so, the film slots in neatly with Reiner's future romantic comedies, and the relationship between Nigel and David is immensely touching, as they have to battle the usual obstcles to their love before realising that they are worthless without each other.  Watch how David celebrates the juvenile misogyny of 'Big Bottoms' by thrusting his priapic axe against Nigel's titular rump.

Hey, that name works, since we barely get to see Derek at all, and his part is so small.Spinal Tap, in most parts, is funny, with the band overreacting to small sandwiches to a three foot high Stonehenge. It is hard, however, to understand or hear all of them since they use British accents and there are no subtitles on the DVD. They did put too many characters in, since I do not know how Fran Dresher got into it or anything.The movie must be the shortest musical ever created, clocking in at 83 minutes. Even so, it stretches the premise out for way too long and would have been better as a half hour or even an hour TV special.There were a fair number of jokes, as I've said before, but they don't ""crack you up"", they just hit you and you give a short laugh. Spinal Tap is entertaining, and all of the main actors are good. Reiner (who also co-scripted with the three leads) seemed to not know he was acting, but his part wasn't very demanding. The wigged band members (who did all their own singing) played their part like they were Spinal Tap. Michael McKean is one of my favorites, and Harry Shearer is from my favorite TV show, The Simpsons.This is Spinal Tap is a usually funny and entertaining but too stretched out comedy that can get your toes a'tapping and your mouth a'smiling.My rating: 7/10Rated R for language.",This Is Spinal Tap

I certainly can't think of many if any mockumentaries that proceed it. Dry cutting humour, ridiculous and lovable characters and as much a love letter to rock as it is a piss-take. What's most enjoyable about watching this, now over 35 years old, is how timeless it feels. Sure you'd assume bands aren't like this anymore, but then assume things at your peril.

Another thing often cited as being popular would be comedy, since a good comedian knows the power of laughter and how it can help people get through very hard times. When you put the two together in one movie, and do them both well, you get This Is Spinal Tap. This ""rockumentary"" follows the story of the fictional English metal band Spinal Tap who have a reputation for playing some very loud music. They're on tour in America to promote their new album ""Smell the Glove."" Martin DiBergi interviews the band's members and learns that many people have been in the band before the current lineup, but died due to ridiculous circumstances such as exploding for no reason and choking on somebody else's vomit. In between the various moments of absurdity, they show the band performing and the stages have a lot of multi-colored lights and extravagant costumes, which brings to mind Bon Jovi. You can say the movie has a very 80s look to it. Later on, one of the musicians shows Martin a custom made amp where the volume adjustments go up to 11 instead of the usual 10, which has become an icon in its own right. Probably my favorite part of this whole movie is when the band orders a stonehenge replica for one of their performances but the person who writes the dimensions of it confuses the symbols for feet and inches. The resulting statue is only 18 inches high and it's absolutely hilarious watching the thing get lowered onto the stage. There's other ridiculous moments in this movie that I can go into detail about but it's no substitute for the real thing. This film never really got much recognition when it came out, and only did moderately well financially, but now it's considered a classic.

What bothered me a bit was that they went a bit too far with the crazy stuff at times, and played it way too straight. The fictitious band actually went on to build a career, in character, which I find rather bizarre. If the actors won't recognize they are in on the joke, the whole thing becomes overburdened in the end.

If his film-making talent is on a par with his taste in rock bands then we could be in serious trouble.DiBergi was attracted to Spinal Tap because of their unusual loudness (any self-respecting Tap fan will know what that means) and has tracked them down while they're about to conduct their first tour of America in six years.The band is made up of lead guitar David St.Hubbins (Michael McKean), Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest, also lead guitar, never could figure that one out) and on bass Derek Smalls (Harry Shearer). I won't bother saying who their drummer is since they're never around for long. 32 drummers now and counting!Shot in the style of actual documentaries, the film follows Spinal Tap on their tour of America, and how the band gradually comes unravelled through one disaster after another. What Spinal Tap don't realise is they're time has come and gone. A fact that gets pointed out to them on more than one occasion. But they're too wrapped up in their dwindling gigs and groupies to notice.Their latest album, 'Smell the Glove' isn't selling because it's too sexist. Gigs are cancelled one after another. Props tend to malfunction at inopportune times (the pod scene is a classic example of comedy timing), and things eventually get so bad that the manager even quits.Behind all the sharp satire and deft characterisation there is an actual serious story going on. There is quite a bit of poignancy to these three innocent souls who fail to realise their time is up. The film also fills in the details of how the band was formed. Beginning as a folk band, then they made the switch to flower power, and eventually transformed into heavy metal. None of their songs are good no matter what they try.There is also quite a bit of subtlety to the dynamics that drive the film. Things are never overtly spelt out for the audience, and it doesn't insult them either. We are observers just like DiBergi is, and we often catch on to things before the cast-members do. That is never more evident than the relationship between David and Nigel.David has a girlfriend, Jeanine, and she has joined the band on their tour. When you watch these scenes, keep your eyes on Nigel. Without any words at all, we can see what is going through his mind. David & Nigel have been friends for years, but Nigel clearly wants more from their relationship, even though David hasn't got a clue. I didn't notice that at first, and I assumed Nigel's behaviour was because he didn't like how Jeanine was running the band (Yoko Ono anyone!). Watch the scene where Nigel storms off, but as he leaves, his eyes shoot daggers at Jeanine. The audience gets the message. Loud and clear. That is one of the things that makes TIST such an enduring and consistently entertaining film. The little things. There are tiny details everywhere. Usually just a little off camera. Every frame tells a story, like the broken TV in the background that has been smashed by the manager. We don't see it happening, but we get the idea.There are so many memorable scenes, like Nigel's amplifiers that go up to 11, the band getting lost on the way to their own concerts, (since we never see that particular concert one wonders if they actually found their way to the stage) and the best part being the Stonehenge production number. A model of Stonehenge is lowered on stage, but an error in scale turns the concert into a fiasco. What makes it hilarious is the fact we were privy to the mistake before the band members were. The looks on their faces are priceless.The members of Spinal Tap, McKean, Guest and Shearer are all American, but all have authentic English accents that blew me away. The dialogue was mostly improvised and the film is all the better for it, and you always notice something different every time. In my last viewing I noticed Nigel is almost never seen without chewing gum. And Christopher Guest enjoyed the documentary style of film-making so much, he adopted it for some of his own films Waiting For Guffman, Best In Show and A Mighty Wind.TIST ends on an optimistic note, with the Japanese coming to their rescue. And despite the fact their music is terrible, its hard not to smile at the end with them giving all they've got. Which, of course, is not much. It is a genuinely moving scene when Nigel and David make up for the good of the band.There are cameos from Anjelica Huston, Billy Crystal, Patrick Macnee. The joys are endless. This Is Spinal Tap is not only an hilarious satire on the pitfalls of heavy metal, but also a moving portrayal of a rock band's fantasy that still believes they're on top, when they're anything but. Long live Spinal Tap!",This Is Spinal Tap
92,Flagrant-Baronessa,Cult-status? What? Why?,5,2 August 2006,"Hack documentarian DiBergi (played by director Rob Reiner himself) follows 1980s glitter rock band 'Spinal Tap' behind the stage as they are launched into a Unites States tour.I've had numerous friends recommend me This is Spinal Tap and, judging by the style of it, I thought for sure I would find this very funny. I finally sat down to watch it, and I kept waiting for a funny moment to arrive. A line, an image, a gag -- anything. The best I could do was smile half-assedly at some of the scenes and only because I so desperately wanted to find it amusing. Spinal Tap seems to shift to automatic pilot very soon in the film and just expect its audience to find the bland band interactions hysterical, as it attempts nothing else. The dialogue is viciously realistic as is the format in which the film is shot, but does that make it funny? No, not really - it only makes it realistic.The cast are not very dynamic. They are, at best, mildly funny in a goofy sort of way that you just chuckle on the inside at, but ultimately every last one of them is incapable of projecting any real charisma or humour on-screen. It is therefore beyond me how This is Spinal Tap ever got vaulted into a cult status. As for good aspects, it does have some interesting approaches to it, like the mockumentary style which it adopts. I'm sure there was comedy behind it, but these ideas were either badly executed or not at all. 5/10",This Is Spinal Tap
93,SkullScreamerReturns,Legendary music comedy but not as funny as I expected,5,3 December 2020,"Everybody who is interested in rock music has probably heard about this movie. It's so popular that even if you haven't seen it you have probably heard its lines quoted somewhere. That was my case too.Maybe I had too high expectations, but I found it only mildly entertaining. There are some funny parts but overall it felt like a bit stale parody, trying too hard to be funny. The case may also be that I'm too deep in the rock & metal culture so that the jokes presented in this movie feel like clichés - nothing new.I also felt like the movie portrays rockers too stupid. Well, I know that real bands do act very stupid especially when drinking their boredom away during long tours, but... I don't know. Maybe it's just that I'm not generally much into parody style of comedy in general, so it's the delivery that annoys a bit at times.I recommend watching the movie because it's such a legendary piece of history. But I don't think it's the best comedy ever, and not even the best music comedy.",This Is Spinal Tap
94,willcundallreview,Some call it a classic,7,19 January 2015,"Rating-7/10This is Spinal Tap is a film that has a cult following and I can kind of see why, but not completely. It has it's many moments and I can't deny laughs were had throughout but part of me did feel it was overrated or one of those cult following films that aren't as good as others say. I felt it was solidly good though and here below is why so.The story is slow at first and the jokes don't flow as crazily as the story but nevertheless jokes come off the reel with skill and precision. I liked everything that is going on and I actually preferred the arguments they all have to the music they play. I did enjoy the music pieces and some the concert scenes can be hilarious and well done, the movie does excel in making what could be stupid jokes into actual smart ones.The casting is very varied but they all work together well, all of the main cast do a good job and to say it is a mockumentary style film they really take to the part well. I like the more random cast more and the little funny bits really stem from strange encounters the band have. I think Rob Reiner does a good job not only delivering the questions as he the documentary maker but also reacts really well too.On to Rob Reiner again and he just happens to direct and co write this movie too so all round Reiner really shows skill and although I believe it could be funnier than it was, he still does a massively solid job. Written by some of the main cast Christoper Guest, Michael McKean, Harry Shearer and of course Reiner, This is Spinal Tap has quick smart jokes and really allows the viewer to laugh at anything.My main criticism is at the jokes, it is funny as I did feel it was a tip top movie but part of me wanted to laugh more and for what some people say, it isn't all that interesting either. It can bore you and with me I felt it doesn't get off the mark well but does manage actually to make some good jokes in the start so I'll give it that.I think this movie was created for rock fans and comedy fans a like and it really has a target demographic. I also felt whilst watching that some people will find it funnier than I did and although I did laugh quite a lot, there are more to be had here. Many will not like it and think of it as kind of stupid and silly but I feel here you have to want to watch it rather than just see if it is funny at all.Overall I gave it a 7/10 and felt it was solidly in that but it could have maybe gone up just a little with a few things. In conclusion this isn't a film that I absolutely loved but could easily see others loving it, this really will come down to what you want in film and what you want to see, but then again anyone should give it a go, and you should in general laugh quite a bit if you have a funny bone.",This Is Spinal Tap
95,rdoyle29,One of the best films about rock music,8,27 September 2000,"One of the sharpest films ever made about the music business, both hilarious and accurate.  It presents every cliche about life on the road, and gets them right.  Many of the ideas of the film are based on the archetypes of rock history:  the emergence of rock and roll bands in Britain in the sixties, moving through skiffle and psychedelia to heavy rock; the tensions and homosexual undertones in the relationship between singer and lead guitarist; the craziness and limited lifespan of drummers; the pretentiousness of concept albums, especially those involving old English/Celtic mythology.

Rock 'n Roll ridiculous is panned in Rolling Stone English from album concepts to stage props and all paraphernalia in between. When David St. Hubbins and Nigel Tufnel spew out such idioms as ""It's such a fine line between clever and stupid"" you know that their cliché'd world is as flawed as their amplifiers that go to eleven. Their stage and interview performances are infectious and their timing is still fresh, decades later and became a new art form into itself. Spinal tap is a mish-mash of music industry persona's attached to an aging heavy metal band.

100,jayjaycee,An absolute jam (or gem),8,28 November 2020,"""This Is Spinal Tap"" is a 1984 musical comedy directed by Rob Reiner starring Christopher Guest and Michael McKean.
⚪
All in all, Rob Reiner's classic mockumentary almost effortlessly taps the audience's heart by hilariously parodying the rock and roll industry by the example of a fictional band that embodies all the stereotypes and characteristics of notorious rock groups during that time in a subtle yet efficiently exaggerated way, and thanks to genuine chemistry between the members, a surprisingly high musicality and its subtle, utterly hilarious, and absurdly dry humour, it becomes a witty persiflage that knows to mock its topic in an intelligent and absolutely efficient, satirical manner.
⚪
Until I have actually looked it up and found out the truth, I have always thought that Spinal Tap was in fact a real group, and not a band formed by comedians. I mean, in this classic episode of ""The Simpsons"" they play concert and die like most of the rock bands that dare to visit Springfield. Quite the contrary, Spinal Tap is a comedy project of mockumentary director Christopher Guest, future ""Better Call Saul"" star Michael McKean and iconic ""The Simpsons"" voice actor Harry Shearer, and the only purpose of their fake band was to mock the industry and illustrate what the business is really like in a funny manner. Originally, they got together for a comedy special on ABC, but after iconic director Rob Reiner became aware of the guys, he decided to produce a satirical documentary and make a swipe at each and every one, and I assure you, it succeeded in its undertaking. Seriously, despite its short runtime of merely eighty minutes, the film manages to mock a myriad of things in the business, and I laugh so hard multiple times. However, I think to find this movie amusing, you must be a rock and roll fan in the first place that rudimentarily knows about the history of the most famous rock groups from that time, otherwise, many jokes will probably not work out as they should. But first, who are Spinal Tap? Well, they are a British rock band founded in nineteen-sixty-four by guitarist Nigel Tufnel (Guest), singer and guitarist David St. Hubbins (McKean) and bassist Derek Small (Shearer), but before they changed their name to Spinal Tap, they were called differently and played a different kind of rock. In what is an obvious sideswipe to The Beatles, it is shown how the guys formerly played a radio-friendly rock while rocking the iconic bowl cuts, before the had their hippie folk rock phase and, ultimately, their hair rock era similar to bands like Bon Jovi and Mötley Crüe. The most astonishing thing about this film is how, despite their comedic original intentions, all the actors are in fact capable of playing their respective instruments. Seriously, the extreme musicality among them creates this feeling of authenticity and makes it utterly realistic. However, what it ridicules is what makes it even more hilarious. I don't want to enumerate every little detail they satirize here, but from sexist, perverse and racist lyrics and album covers to drummers that mysteriously have died over the decades, there is everything. They at times ridicule the real fates of bands like Led Zeppelin, Queen and Black Sabbath, and even depict the decline and decreasing popularity of rock bands during the early to mid-eighties. Since most of the jokes are almost inside jokes, the humour lies in the subtleties and furthermore, is absolutely dry. It is not the type of ""Seth Rogen doing something infantile"" type of humour that makes you wheeze because the characters are doing something funny, no, you will laugh about what the actors say and do, even though they stay totally serious themselves. Like, when they narrate the mysterious phenomenon of their drummers, their album names and covers, or when Nigel proudly shows director DiBergi his guitar collection as well as his strange amplifier, you will laugh simply because of how abstruse the whole thing is. It is becoming even more funny when they try to fight their fading glory by including gimmicks in their shows, fight about creative differences and women. Reportedly, many musicians, such as Ozzy Osbourne laughed and cried during the film because it was so hilarious yet to utterly true, and I think that describes the film's comedic nature best: it superbly balances its humour between exaggerated depiction of stereotypes and subtle, almost casual jokes, and this combination harmonizes wonderfully. In the end, I was utterly pleased with the outcome of this film, because it managed to make me laugh out loud on multiple occasions and perfectly satirize the entire music world in roughly eighty minutes. Mockumentaries have probably never been as great as this one, and hence I think it is indeed a jam (or gem).",This Is Spinal Tap

102,Hermit C-2,Rockumentary is a mockumentary,10,28 May 1999,"This is FANTASTIC! Writers Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer in collaboration with director Rob Reiner have created a satire so dead-on its target that it might be scary if it wasn't so hilarious.Filmmaker Marty DiBergi, taking a break from dog food commercials, is determined to capture the sights, sounds and smells of his favorite rock group, the legendary Spinal Tap, on their latest U.S. tour. They're a 20-year old heavy metal outfit from England centering around lead singer David St. Hubbins (McKean), lead guitarist Nigel Tufnel (Guest) and bass guitarist Derek Smalls (Shearer).  The rest of the band is a revolving door of personnel including a series of unlucky drummers who have met with bizarre demises. The new tour is the first the band has made of America in years, and unfortunately the they seem to have lost about as many fans as they've lost brain cells. When asked if the smaller venues that the band is playing on this tour means they are losing popularity, manager Ian Faith (Tony Hendra) quickly dismisses the idea. The band's fans are just becoming more ""selective,"" he says.Still, the group is received well at their initial shows--that is if the gig hasn't been canceled, if their balky stage props don't malfunction, and if the band can find its way to the stage from their dressing rooms. But the tour is one disaster following another. Fans don't show up for autograph sessions at record stores. Radio stations play their oldies and ask, ""where are they now?"" To top things off, David's girlfriend Jeanine (June Chadwick), the band's Yoko Ono, arrives. She soon starts contributing her ideas, such as having the band dress in fantasy creature costumes and recording their music ""in Dubly.""Even with all this trouble, the band feels things will pick up if they can just get their new album released. But Polymer Records refuses to distribute ""Smell the Glove"" with its lurid cover art. Eventually it's released with a solid black record sleeve, with nary a word or picture on it. This turns out to be a reverse image of the Beatles' white album in appearance, artistic success and sales. The band sinks so low as to be billed second to a puppet show at a theme park. The pressures are just too much and as the tour limps to a close the long life of Spinal Tap seems at an end. But rock & roll is a funny business...Throughout we're treated to the band's rock & roll wisdom and philosophy. For instance, Nigel lets Marty in on one of the reasons for their success--loud amplifiers. While the volume settings on other bands' equipment might just go to 10, theirs goes to 11! Asked if there's really a difference, Nigel replies, ""Yeah, well it's like... one louder, innit?""There are tons of cameos by all sorts of people, including some funny portrayals of PR flacks by Fran Drescher and Paul Shaffer. This is a brilliant comedy that, despite all the parody, loves its subject. Treat yourself to it.",This Is Spinal Tap
103,jldmp1,The Fine Line,10,19 December 2006,"While neither 'movies' about rock bands, nor spoof documentaries were new inventions at the time this was made, this is the best in its class. The point of departure is, of course, Idle's ""The Rutles"", though the construction of the visual humor is completely different. Idle and the Pythons are experts at skit construction, chiefly the juxtaposition of two unrelated activities in the frame, or introducing one element that is seriously out of place -- worked great for television, and for their first movie experiment.Reiner approaches this -first and foremost- as a movie. He frames it for us as a 'documentary'; we and everyone within are fully aware of the fact that it's a movie. The biggest controversy arises right away...are Spinal Tap real? And the answer is yes! How is a writing team of Guest, McKean, Shearer and Reiner any different from innumerable acts who also use 'stage names' and alternate identities? They write, perform and record their own music. What the studio didn't understand (and if I remember correctly, for this reason they shelved this movie for over a year), is that what is invented is not the band, but the -perception- of the band and the -perception- of their fame. Reiner expertly causes the confusion by framing the contents with 'interviews' with the fans, by framing the music with a complete discography (even a series of 'critiques'), and by framing each shot in such a way that allows full improv freedom. Improvised camera movement. Improvised scenes. His editing of jokes is top notch -- no dithering or second-guessing.The actual joke content and plot doesn't need description, all of that is plain to see on the canvas -- side-splitting, naturally. What makes it worthwhile is being in the know; knowing where that fine line is between frame and canvas, and between rock lore and hyperbole.Reiner's frame/canvas construction was his calling card in the '80s ('Stand by Me', 'Princess Bride'). But this was his best.",This Is Spinal Tap

The three main members of Spinal Tap are David St. Hubbies played by Michael McKean, Nigel Tufnel played by Christopher Guest and Derek Smalls played by Harry Shearer. To say that all three are hilarious in their roles would be an understatement!!! The film follows them around on a new American tour that the band starts to.promote a new album. The band is aweful, and their lyrics are the typical hard rock, heavy metal stuff that came out in the late 70's early 80's. Their lyrics are terrible but are kind of accurate to the time. They are followed around by a documentary filmmaker named Marty DiBergi played by Rob Reiner. He does the typical interviews of tge band and talks to them about their history, their opinions about their music etc. like most of these films do. The film makes fun of how pretentious some rock musicians become. There is a moment when Nigel complains to his manager about the size of the bread for sandwiches backstage before a show. It is hilarious!!! All three leads are good but the biggest laughs belong to Christopher Guest as Nigel. The film makes fun of rock documentaries such as The Beatles A Hard Days Night and Led Zeppelin The Song Remains the Same films. The concerts scenes are really funny and pathetic at the end when Spinal Tap is playing to neatly empty arenas.

At the very least, it's good at being bad, and that's sometimes more than enough to get a song to the top of the charts. It's not exactly the quality, but the believability of the music being lampooned that makes ""Spinal Tap"" a great piece of satire. Like any good band documentary, the story of Spinal Tap is told through their music: they had more artistic phases than The Beatles, more previous members than Black Sabbath, and fell from grace like Guns 'N Roses, and at every stage their material is brilliantly, unmistakably derivative of those legends and their ilk. It's one thing to know exactly what's pretentious and corny and laughable about those acts, great as they all were, but it's another and deeply impressive thing to be able to showcase their excesses through music. Spinal Tap's early, Ed Sullivan-esque days sees them in mop tops and suits, singing jangly, catchy, teeny-bopper pop that really feels imported from the mid 1960s. Same for their flower- power days, the absurd put-ons of their goth rock era, the wanna-be virtuoso indulgence of their progressive experimentalism, and most of all, their preening, testosterone-driven glam rock of the late 1970s and early 80s. This last subgenre is the one the movie skewers most ruthlessly: the ridiculous songs ""Heavy Duty"" and ""Big Bottom"" are two of the wittiest and most scatological in the film, and at the same time are only slight exaggerations of real-life analogues.Much of the non-musical material in ""Spinal Tap"" works just as brilliantly. The script is quotable in the extreme. It is concise and cutting with its observations on the music industry, as in hilarious dispute over a sexist album cover between a label executive (Fran Drescher) and Christopher Guests's oblivious lead guitarist Nigel Tufnel (one of many delightfully English names in the film).At times, the movie is as earnest and emotional as real band documentaries can be. The Lennon/McCartney-inspired arc between best friends Nigel and David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean) could almost have been the focus of a straight drama. Near the end, that storyline strains the mockumentary format as the proportion of sentiment to snark shifts in favor of the former, but by this time the points have been scored. Spinal Tap has all the foibles of history's great rock bands, so it would be unfair, and inaccurate, if they didn't take on their essential likability, too.",This Is Spinal Tap

The ""Stonehenge"" set was my favourite bit, but *every* line, nuance and song-lyric is judged to perfection. As with Withnail and I, the quotability is nigh-on endless.

I'm rooting for a This Is Spinal Tap spinoff where we look into the lives of most Pop/Rap/EDM/ Alternative artists today. It doesn't even have to be a mockumentary, it literally could transpire in reality and it'd probably end up just as laugh-out-loud as This Is Spinal Tap.

A lot of the gags, therefore, may go right over the heads of todays MTV hiphop dance generation but us oldsters can take a good guess where these guys are firing their lampoons at.One of the infamous lines in the movie is ""there's a very fine line between clever & stupid"". But I also think the film itself is a very fine line between fiction & probable fact. I wonder how many real rock bands have suffered similar ignominy and find watching this film too close to the bone!Another virtue is that the film doesn't have to try hard to get its message across; the actors don't really have to stretch themselves with concise scripts & acting ability - this is, afterall, supposed to be a fly-on-the-wall documentary where adlibbing is encouraged.British TV company, Channel 4, produced a similar tv movie called ""Bad News on Tour"" by The Comic Strip,at around the same time, and although it probably never reached the States it too is very very funny and follows the same kind of adlib roadie logic of its bigger brother. The only difference is that the subtle lampooning is never made so obvious, but its a good film to add to this kind of rockumentary collective.The only shocking thing is the length of the film - barely 80 minutes. Blink and its almost over. I suppose the producers & director Reiner didn't originally have high hopes of box office success & cult status so it was a movie made very much on the defensive I guess, which is a real shame. Just when we're beginning to really know these guys the movie is over and we end up like Oliver Twist, desperately asking for more!And yes, those immortal words ""This amp goes up to 11"" should be recognised with equal merit alongside ""Frankly, my dear...."", ""Play it again, Sam..."" and ""May the force...."".

110,son_of_cheese_messiah,Does not go up to 11,7,9 September 2009,"This is probably the most over rated comedy ever, in part due to the rambling, semi-improvisatory nature of it. The scene in which they get lost back stage and end up going round in circles pretty much sums up much of the film for me. A tighter script and a lot of editing would have helped.The film does have its funny moments and of course some lines of dialogue which have become iconic. Its not as funny as it thinks it is though and some of the jokes, such as the exploding drummers, do not fit easily into the generally realistic tone of the rest. The songs are superb parodies, in someways superior to what they are parodying. However, some of the set piece concert scenes, like the film itself, does drag in places due to its lack of focus.While Christopher Guest and Michael McKean are very good, the cast is not universally up to the same standard; even Harry Shearer, later famous as the voice of Mr Burns, is a virtual shadow in the film. Other band members only get to speak during the final screen credits.This film has become highly influential, itself not necessarily a good thing, since ab-libbing is an art which few do well.All in all a decent comedy, but far from being the towering classic it is claimed by some.",This Is Spinal Tap
111,cordenw,One of the best,10,6 March 2014,"I watched this back in '84 and decided to watch it again last night.It's still just as funny because it's a parody of human nature and you don't need special effects or iphones to make it work in today's culture. The biting satire and the ""hauteur"" quality that Rob Reiner gives to the Spinal Tap mockumentary is right on the money. What, with this and The Rutles, you've got the entire music industry of the time speared like a fish.( it's probably still the same!) I love the way they were changed from flower people to heavy metal and I love how inept the Manager is... pure genius. Could they ever do one like this for Britney Spears or Kanye West or are we just seeing that played out in real life? I wish there were movies of this quality out today instead of trash like Anchorman2 or The Big Wedding but I guess most of the talented writers and directors have moved on to Cable TV.

The feat was done several times after that, but there are reasons why ""Spinal Tap"" still has survived them all. One of them is: It's downright hilarious, and another: The music is great. Plus: It's louder, ONE louder! Yep, that's because they have amplifiers that go to up to eleven!Played straight, a lot of it improvised, yet definitely not entirely invented, Reiner and company go for laughs which seem to be inherent in the music business they portray: Get ready for drummer combustion, bizarre deadly gardening accidents, sleek, pastel black covers, big bottoms and grave songs, then there's Artie Fufkin from Polymer Records, serious snack problems, managing wives, Artie Fufkin, Polymer Records, guitars you better not look at, well, it's all there. Even the literally cheesy trailer. Plus Artie Fufkin. From Polymer Records - have I mentioned that one?""Spinal Tap"" is full of inside jokes and therefore repeated viewings pay off.

113,ryan_kuhn,"""But These Go To 11...""",9,13 February 2005,"I know it is boring to give all of the aspects of the movie ""A's,"" but I liked this movie so much, I had no other choice. During the height of heavy metal hair bands in the mid-1980s, the American public was ready for a documentary detailing the lives of ""Britain's loudest band,"" Spinal Tap. What one has to realize, of course, is that Spinal Tap is made up of 3 comedic actors who have spent time on Saturday Night Live, Laverne and Shirly, and The Simpsons, some of them all 3. Michael McKean, Lenny on L&S, plays lead singer David St. Hubbins, Christopher Guest, later a director of Best In Show and A Mighty Wind, plays lead guitarist Nigel Tufnel, and Harry Shearer, portrayer of many characters on the Simpsons (Monty Burns, Principal Skinner, etc.) is bass player Derek Smalls. The focus of the movie is how a band of rockers who were at the top of the world deal with sagging popularity and lagging record sales. The movie, directed by Rob Reiner, is entirely improve and features cameos of stars before they were stars: Billy Crystal, Dana Carvey, Fran Dreisher, Fred Willard, and Letterman band leader Paul Schaffer. Most of the memorable scenes are based on setup. The band appears to be clueless on simple things in life at the start of the movie, but confirmation comes in the middle of the movie when the stage is hard to find at one of Tap's gigs. Another involves the band wanting to spice up their shows with a huge replica of Stonehenge, but the results are pure comedy. As silly as the movie is, the audience really roots for these hapless music makers. The end of the movie is uplifting, well as uplifting as a movie about heavy metal can be, and there is a sense as even when Spinal Tap is down, they still love what they are doing.",This Is Spinal Tap
114,Rathko,Classic,10,6 February 2006,"'This is Spinal Tap' still holds up as the best mockumentary ever made for the simple reason that it is so believable. All involve manage to push every situation to its limits without making the fatal step into ridiculous slap-stick or obvious parody. The ignorant, self-delusional, preening, mock-sincerity of celebrities, heard in a thousand interviews over the years, is perfectly captured. What makes these characters all the more tragic is that they remain forever clueless as to just how dumb and talentless they really are.The performances from the leads are incredible, with each actor completely inhabiting his character, bringing a depth and honesty that is genuinely award-worthy. The dialogue, much of it improvised, is pure gold, with more quotable lines per minute than just about any other film in history. And of course the music, a pitch-perfect recreation of the very best of strutting cock-rock, is unforgettable.Simply a brilliant movie, and one of the best comedies ever made.",This Is Spinal Tap

119,JeffG.,The funniest movie ever!,10,5 October 1999,"Hillarious movie about an ageing rock band that embarks on a disasterous North American tour. No matter how many times I see this movie, it never fails to make me laugh. So many great gags and classic lines that have been quoted time and time again. The fact that they improvised all the dialogue is expecially impressive. Improvied comedy at its best.
This movie especially hits home if you've had any kind of experience in the music business. You either laugh because you've shared some of the same experiences as this band or you get depressed for exactly the same reasons. The stupidity of the band members is also worth a lot of laughs. You can't help but laugh at a band who descibes their music in deep, philosophical terms while writing songs like ""Big Bottom"" and ""Sex Farm."" It's amazing how many real-life bands in the 80's seemed to share the same mentality as these guys.Unfortunately, this also happens to be one of the most difficult to find movies around, as it's been out of print on video for years. It got released on DVD lat year but it's now out of print on that format as well for some reason. Hopefully, someone will wake up and reissue this classic film again.",This Is Spinal Tap
120,wandereramor,There's a fine line between stupid and clever,9,4 November 2014,"The mockumentary is by this point a well-established genre, but today's faux-docs (often in the form of TV series like The Office) can often seem like ordinary scripted comedy where the characters occasionally talks to the camera. This is Spinal Tap, the film that really popularized the sub-genre, goes to great lengths to mimic and parody the documentary form: quick cuts, nonsensical asides, an awkward director occasionally stumbling on camera, no real narrative direction until the final act, and a lot of ugly people struggling to say something meaningful.Of course, the main thing that makes This is Spinal Tap a classic is that it's incredibly funny. The good-natured but dim musicians of the titular band are less a parody of rock stars than an absurd band of characters thrust into semi-fame. The band's fictional history, complete with flower-child flashbacks and a long line of dead drummers, is the richest vein of comedy. A few of the movie's gags have been overexposed through endless repetition (call it Monty Python syndrome), but there's a lot of clever comedy that still resonates. Reiner and screenwriter Christopher Guest are capable of both broad, goofy comedy and understated bits that only the attentive will catch.There are probably some points on which you could critique This is Spinal Tap -- the characters are hard to distinguish until about halfway through, and there is the above-mentioned lack of narrative -- but the whole picture is so shaggily charming that it's hard not to smile and laugh along. If you haven't seen this, it may be the best use of 80 minutes of your time around.",This Is Spinal Tap

It is the revealed truth. Think I'm lying? Go out and buy a Stratocaster, learn the opening bars to ""Stairway to Heaven"" and go play it with your band in front of an assembly of 16 year-old drug-addled geeks at your friendly local bar. Then come back and we'll talk. That aside, any metalhead Beavis can tell you that ""Tap"" is one of the top ten funniest movies ever committed to celluloid. What's even funnier is that I happened to be watching ""The Joe Franklin Show"" shortly after the movie came out, and it seems that nobody on Joe's staff told him that the band was a goof. Joe proceeded to interview them as if they were the real deal. Proof positive, once again, that truth is not only stranger, but a whole lot more ridiculous than fiction. (By the way, if anyone has a copy of that particular show lying around some roach-infested corner of his/her attic, I would be forever in your debt for just a peek.)

The best part about this was an amazing back up cast that came in for cameos a long time before they were famous including Fran Drescher, Billy Crystal, Dana Carvey, and Fred Willard. What made it so funny was that even though it was satire a lot of the dialog they were using is how real rockers talk in interviews and such. They did it perfectly and I can see why Christopher Guest and company shot to legendary status right after this even though I'm not always the biggest fan of his. A film very similar to this but for a rap group is ""CB4"" which is also very comical but this certainly took the cake. The songs are actually decent as well and probably served a basis for ""Tenacious D"" as an inspiration since they are very close sounding even though ""The D"" takes it even more over the top.

124,trnjamesbond,Silly situations made to be serious.,9,14 October 2012,"I vote this film highly, I have caught bits and pieces over the years on TV but had never had the chance to actually watch it. And I grew up in the 80's.I thought most of my younger years that Spinal Tap was a real band. I was only about 7 years old when this came out, so please forgive me. I sat down to watch this, and realized, no they are not real, and yes it is very funny how Rob Reiner takes previous films like Led Zepplin's ""The Song Remains the Same"" documentary film, and turns it on it's head. Especially when the lead singer in this film tries to do the Jimmy Page and instead of a violin bow on a guitar he actually takes a whole violin and uses it to play the guitar. This was hilarious, or when they try to sing popular tunes from other bands they always forget the words. I could go on and on.This film captures most of all the rock documentaries that I have seen from Zepplin to the Rolling Stones documentaries, it's so interesting how Reiner captures that by the film grade and just the acting in general. This film is actually looks and feels like Depeche Mode 101 directed by D.A Pennebaker. But that film wasn't made until a few years after. But it's funny how close it is to this film, kinda creepy.I'd say ""This is Spinal Tap"" is a very funny film in an indirect British humour kind of way. The humour is very subtle, and sometimes have to think about it. It's one of those films where you have to watch it multiple times and see something different every time. I love how the film goes from the band being very popular to playing concerts to a smaller and smaller audience, this is another subtle thing I noticed.Great film, I loved it too bad it took 35 years to get around to it. The only problem I have is that is was too short.",This Is Spinal Tap
125,HanShotFirstGR,"So damn accurate, so damn hillarious",8,24 April 2021,"Plot:Spinal Tap, one of England's loudest bands, is chronicled by film director Marty DiBergi on what proves to be a fateful tour.Analysis:Mockumentaries are not my cup of tea because most of the time they end up being silly nonsense but this one was totally charming. Not only it does some valid and non-harmful criticism to hard rock/glam metal era, but it also does great satire on a culture that influenced many lives and it's well-known to most people. Whether you love or hate this era of rock n' roll this movie will blow your mind by how hillarious is this parody.Of course the main reason of this movie's success is that it depicts perfectly this whole culture without being offensive to people who liked it. 80s rock was all about sex, drugs, girls, leather jackets and tight pants, so seeing a movie, that can produce funny content and at the same time respect the people who loved all that, is really surprising.All the actors did a fine job, they have the style they have the passion and they have the ambition to create something memorable and great with the help of Rob Reiner who crafted a fantastic comedic experience for the viewers. It's well written, with some funny dialogue that could fit to any band of the genre, stupid tunes but catchy and fun, obviously crazy over the top attitude and probably anything you can think those famous 80s bands would do.The only drawback I would say is that you'll may laugh with the whole concept and how accurate is the parody but in general there aren't so many moments that the actual joke was the thing that triggered the laughter. The style and aesthetic of this movie is way funnier that the stuff it contains which are some cheap jokes added to a well-though situation. Also, it might be very boring to people with no prior knowledge of this lifestyle because the entertainment needs the viewer to compare these things constantly with real-life situations of that era.Conclusion:A very good film that works fine and it will definetely be rewarding to all of the people who lived the 80s or learned about them. It's well-made satire respectful to rock n' roll fanbase that will definetely make your day better.Rating: 8/10.",This Is Spinal Tap

(I still can't figure out why they cut the scene with the disappointed fan at the autograph signing.)  Still, I have no plans to buy the DVD--or even watch the movie again.

129,el_monty_BCN,One of the funniest comedies ever made. And that's the truth!,9,4 April 2001,"How many times has this happened to you: You hear and you read endless amounts of praise about an old film which is considered a classic in its genre, and for some reason you've never had a chance to see it, and then when you get round to watching it, even if it's reasonably good, it dissapoints you, because it just can't live up to all those years of hype you've been exposed to.This has certainly happened to me with lots of films, and, as I went into the cinema to see Spinal Tap for the first time, in its recent UK re-release, I feared it would happen again. For years I had been reading article after article after review invariably claiming this film to be one of the most hilarious ever made, a masterpiece of comedy, and of course I was dying to see it; but I was sure that if I saw it expecting ""one of the funniest comedies ever"" (and there was no way I could avoid that), it would not measure up, no way, and I would be sadly disappointed... againThe wonderful thing was that I wasn't, not at all: That's how good Spinal Tap is. It took for me a little while to get into the dynamic of it, but when Nigel started having problems with the size of the bread I just began to laugh out loud and I hardly stopped throughout the film, I couldn't help myself. The astounding creativity and wit of the cast and director, coming up with those scenes and those lines most of the time by improvising, never ceases to amaze me. And the characters were instantly lovable and memorable, despite (or, more precisely, because of) their abysmal stupidity. I just couldn't get enough of them, and the film, though it is actually quite short, seemed CRIMINALLY short to me when the credits started rolling.In a few months I have gone from being a Spinal Tap ignoramus to a die hard fan, and a viewing of the DVD satiated my hunger for more with a glorious extra hour of outtakes which are just as funny as what Reiner (sorry, Di Bergi) left in.

130,lizziebeth-1,STILL the best mockumentary of all time; Best in Show(2000) by most of the same actors is merely a distant second. 10/10. Baby spoilers.,10,14 March 2003,"`We don't....we're....we're not university material.'Just get the Special Edn right now-if you don't, you'll be missing half the movie. Literally. The half that was deleted for theatrical release is every bit as good, and fresh, as the half that was kept.The actors' talents will blow you away. Not only do Michael McKean as David St.Hubbins and  Christopher Guest as Nigel Tufnel have impeccable East-Ender English accents (tragically, Harry Shearer's accent as Derek Smalls keeps slipping back into his real Yank), but the actors pick up their old-pair-of-jeans personas 16yrs later for the audio commentary.
It's as if Spinal Tap never `retired'.`In the 1990s the fictitious group reunited for a series of concerts and a TV special' (Leonard Maltin). Naturally, for years I thought Tap were a real band: with an authentic logo, a 1980s white-trash-rocker-look with long, heavy-metal hair, skeleton-emblazoned sleeveless T-shirts and lurid lycra hotpants, they're indistinguishable from real rockers of the day.
They even nail a 1960s soundalike clip, 'Listen to the Flower People'. Shame we never see its follow-up song, 'Again with the Flower People'-its title alone implies hilarity. During DiBergi's `rockumentary', Tufnel also plays a gorgeous, tinkly `Mach' piano solo, which he has unfortunately called 'Lick my Love-Pump'.All their video clips are credible, except for 'Stonehenge' (St.Hubbins' defense is to blame their manager:  `...but you're not as confused as Nigel-are you?').It was a lot of fun getting fooled, but discovering it was all bogus makes them seem all the more talented, and hilarious!Their very first drummer, John 'Stumpy' Peeps (Ed Begley Jr) supposedly died `in a freak gardening accident'. His replacement died by choking on vomit. `Actually, he choked on someone else's vomit', adds Tufnel in a DiBergi interview. During their Flower People period Peter 'James' Bond apparently `exploded on stage' in a green puff of smoke. His replacement also `exploded'. 'Tap now think they despatched something like 37 drummers over the years.The boys are indeed screamingly funny (listen closely to the dialogue). Infuriatingly, Leonard Maltin thinks they aren't funny enough, despite calling their effort `cunning satire'. Their humour is extreme improv, which cannot afford too many over-the-top lines, lest it jeopardizes our suspension of disbelief!Spinal Tap are dopey repulsivos narcissistically convinced of their own relevance. The actors play them completely straight, which requires timing that never slips up. Mockumentaries take enormous discipline and talent. Clearly McKean, Guest & Shearer could do St.Hubbins, Tufnel & Smalls till the cows came home. (There's about an hour's worth of additional 1984 footage on the Special Edition DVD; plus the brand new audio commentary recorded 16yrs later).The director of the `rockumentary', Marty DiBergi (actually the co-writer of the script, the songs, actor, and also the real director, Rob Reiner), remains admirably skeptical in reporting Tap's comprehensive lack of success during their comeback tour of America, ie now that their appeal has become `more selective'.He probes their pasts, asks the relevant questions, and reads out `published reviews' of their previous albums:*'Intravenus DeMilo': `The tasteless cover is a good indication of the lack of musical invention within. The musical growthrate of this band cannot even be charted; they're treading water in a sea of retarded sexuality and bad poetry', to which the boys retort, `That's nitpicking!'*'Shark Sandwich': `This had a 2-word review. Sh!t sandwich.'DiBergi then goes on to observe that `the makeup of your audience seems to be young...boys'. St.Hubbins+Tufnel explain: `Well, it's a sexual thing, really. Aside from the identifying the boys do with us, there's also a reaction of the female(s) to our music....' Tufnel: `Really, they're quite fearful.  They see us on stage, with tight trousers; we've got, you know, armadillos in our trousers!....it's quite frightening, the size; and they run, screaming' (watch McKean almost lose it for real at Guest's `armadillo' improv).Tap's litany of embarrassing stage accidents (over&above the despatched drummers) include Nigel overextending backwards and getting stuck; their stage-effect `pods' seizing up with Derek inside while stagehands feverishly hammer away; and sound interference from an airbase transmission tower. But the never-to-be-forgotten CLASSIC is when the band gets lost underground, trying to find the stage door. Of course, this scene has since been paid homage by legitimate bands such as The Rolling Stones, admitting the same thing happening to them in real life!The list of cameos includes Fran Drescher as Bobbie Flekman the Polymer Records hostess; Dana Carvey and Billy Crystal as mime waiters in whiteface (backstage, Crystal, the head waiter, in an apparently throwaway role, bosses the unrecognizable Carvey around with `Mime is money!  Move it!'); Patrick MacNee as Sir Dennis; Crystal's real-life friend Bruno Kirby as that limo driver enamoured of Frank Sinatra; Joyce Hyser from Just One of the Guys as Brenda the brunette groupie; Anjelica Huston as the Stonehenge modelmaker; and as mentioned, Ed Begley Jr as 'Stumpy' Peeps.No `rockumentary' would be complete without the obligatory group breakup, hysterical tantrums and overbearing girlfriends; but Tap's level of talent and commitment seems to prick the bubbles of all heavy-metal bands.The credits roll-at 1hr:16mins-much too soon, because the movie is still going. DiBergi is still interviewing them, asking, `Do you feel your music is racist?' St.Hubbins and Tufnel rebuff this with `No, 'course not, we say `Love your brother'-well, we don't say it, really'; `...We don't literally say it...we don't literally mean it...'-a line that always slays me. THIS line is MY fav., not Maltin's one about the amplifier dial that `goes up to 11'-which for me is only the 2nd-funniest.TiST still reigns as the Mother of All Mocku(rocku)mentaries, with its seamless, screamingly funny `cunning satire'.(10/10)",This Is Spinal Tap

Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer (also script and music co-writers, along with Reiner) have the time of their lives while giving right-on-the-mark perfs as the brain-fried band members who are suffering the usual indignities of a band slowly going down for the last count.  Hilarious squabblings over bad album covers, cheap set props, and poor management, along with informal comments on the direction of the band, their image, promo parties, and scheduling headaches get the full treatment, satirizing every cliche there is.  The boys themselves present riveting Jagger-like stances, attitudes and accents that go beyond real.  The backstage haps and ""concert"" footage, in particular have real bite.Favorite bits:  Guest and his 11-volume control amplifier, Fred Willard greeting a very unenthused band to his military base fete; Shearer getting pinned inside a futuristic prop piece; and McKean's all-out raunchy vocals.
A cult favorite over the years, the cutting edge humor has dulled a bit, becoming more and more a time capsule piece as time goes by, but that alone is probably the best reason now to see it, just to find out what all the buzz was about when this first came out in 1984.Guest, of course, went on to create two other highly successful ""mockumentaries"" -- ""Waiting for Guffman"" and ""Best in Show.""",This Is Spinal Tap

As it turned out, last week, I saw it at the video library and decided there and then it was time to see what the fuss was all about. I had the movie for a good week before I finally sat and started to watch it, and I had abit of reluctancy at first viewing. I didn't watch the entire movie but a couple of days later, I sat down on my own and watched it right through. Without distractions, I finally realized what a great movie this is, it was actually quite funny. It is one of those movies that I need to watch more than once to get the jokes behind the movie, and the fact that this is a mockumentary of a fictitious band. From the feedback and internet comments I have read, it appears to be close to the mark, and this is what made this movie such a fun movie to watch. Like Shaun of the Dead that watched a month or so ago, This Is Spinal Tap will be one of those movies that I must have in my collection and watch it at least once or twice a year.",This Is Spinal Tap
136,bedazzle,fair start for Guest,6,23 June 2001,"After having just seen 'Best of Show,' I can see the many similarities in these two movies. Many of the same actors appear in each, the dialogue flows in the same way, and the comedy employs satire, visual humor and free association humor. 'Best of Show,' however, uses each of these facets superbly more efficaciously.For one, 'Spinal Tap' has no plot. The band goes on tour, it doesn't go well, so they get another tour. Yes, it is based on a true story; but I'm sure the real band had some conflict, tension, climax, and conclusion, in their careers. Some tension was even hinted at between David's wife and Nigel, but nothing comes of it. The David/Nigel conflict itself is under developed, as is the reunion.Also, the visual humor directed at the Tap wardrobe gets old fast. It's funny - for a few minutes - to see the 80's rock style with the long scrappy hair and loud hot pants. The same diminishing humor can be equated with the rock behavior during the concerts - concerning the spread eagles and facial contorsions.'Best of Show' gets past this decreasing utility by scripting a wide array of unique characters - showing that Guest had learned from his mistakes. Since 'Spinal Tap' cannot do this, other types of humor must be used to fill the void.The off the top of the head free association humor is what this crew does best. The ""11"" scene and the ""little bread"" scene are perfect examples. These amount to really to only enjoyable parts of the movie.Basically, this movie represents a nice early try and good attempt for Guest and company. His later films correct many of the lackings of 'Spinal Tap.' So it's good as a historical film for anyone interested in this cast.",This Is Spinal Tap

Based on their own list, that should be more than enough for inclusion on the list. I'm hoping my efforts will help. Those that have been critical of this movie seem are missing the following points: 1) If the movie has not one but SEVERAL lines that have become widely used in mainstream culture, then like it or not it's a very influential movie. Once a day I hear someone (or myself) saying ""These go to 11,"" ""Hello, Cleveland!!!"" or ""I think that the problem may have been... that there was a Stonehenge monument on the stage that was in serious danger of being crushed... by a dwarf."" At least once every two minutes there is a quotable, HILARIOUS line. There is no other movie around that I hear quoted as frequently. 2) The satire of ""Spinal Tap"" was pulled off so seamlessly, that everyone younger than 25 THINKS SPINAL TAP WAS A REAL BAND! 3) Since most of the youngsters have never seen ""Spinal Tap,"" I have seen it quite a few times with people who have never seen it, and never has anyone NOT said it was one of the funniest movies they have ever seen.

Or when the four of them come up through the stage in plastic tubes only for one to not open at the start of the song or during any part of it and ends up needing to be rescued by stage hands!

140,pleiades10,Still funny - but real life bands have surpassed this parody,6,26 March 2002,"Back in 1984, there was no VH-1, hence no ""Where Are They Now"", or ""Behind The Music"". Also in 1984, we hadn't yet heard of Winger, Skid Row, Slaughter, Poison, or any of the other ""hair bands"" that we hate to love.
Hence, ""This Is Spinal Tap"" was a blistering parody of British heavy metal rock that was just really coming into stride around that time in '84. The scenes involving the Stonehenge set, the fight between the band's manager and lead singer's girlfriend (obviously a nod to Yoko Ono), any of the absolutely ridiculous ""videos"" and ""concert performances"" (Sex Farm, Bitch School, Big Bottom) are all still quite funny and well done - except maybe a little sobering now, especially when you realize that the real bands ""the Tap"" are spoofing (those that came out in the late 80s ""hair metal"" boom) were often as silly, clueless and destined for obscurity as this fictional group of guys is...It's also fun to play ""spot the cameo""... many are obvious, some not so obvious, but we have folks like Howard Hessman, Fran Drescher, Paul Schaffer, Billy Crystal, Dana Carvey, and others popping their faces into a scene here and there.

Must have some brains to get all the jokes,10,25 August 2013,"It's funny to read the few comments here such as those saying that ""School of Rock"" was a great film about Rock and Roll. That pretty much sums up the limits of some of the viewers, unfortunately.This film is about a genre in Rock and Roll. If you lived through the 70s, 80s or even the early 90s as a teenager or adult, you can related to the perfect satire of this genre. Many of the jokes are so funny and have some basis in a little bit of what makes people well rounded that they may fly right over the head of younger viewers (""I prize the rent from the local Hebrews."")Without a doubt, if you're a musician you will love this film. If you're not a musician you might not get all the jokes but it is still a hilarious, fun ride. It takes you through everything from the political correctness that is ""the entertainment industry"" to the image conscious era of 60s/70s rock bands where sexuality reigned supreme.So my guess is that if you're a younger viewer or not at all into the music scene, you may not fully relate. Regardless, this is the movie that started all the mockumentaries and for good reason. The performances are stellar - the actors ARE the band.

142,enmussak,Fails to amuse,6,25 December 2002,"Now some parts of this movie were funny, but overall Christopher Guest annoys me to no end in all three of his major films (this one, Guffman, and Best of Show).  At the time, when rock was king, this film was probably a lot more relevant.  But I'm 22, and the old rockers and 80's hair bands were fading quickly when I started listening to music.  I've seen VH1 documentaries and know enough about the ""rock 'n' roll"" lifestyle to get the jokes.  I also get Guest's subtle, dry sense of humor and where the jokes are, but I just don't laugh.  Perhaps I reject his basic tenet of humor based on laughing at other people's stupidity (in the way he does it).  I believe this movie and the other two in Guest's pathetic trilogy are solely for that special breed of popular kids in high school that overtly or covertly relished in every moment of their supremacy.

I was in stitches when Nigel was showing off his guitars and one was untouched and NO ONE could touch it.

This was a guy who really knew what he was doing when transitioning from All in the Family to being a Hollywood director.If you haven't seen this it is a must. If you have give it another rewatch it holds up magnificently.While I miss the greatness Rob Reiner gave us in the 80's with his films and wish it would transition into his directorial efforts in this day and age there is no denying this man has a fine talent for directing good comedies with the right script and this film is a jewel of an example of what a well written comedy screenplay should be.I cant give it an 11 like the amplifier in the movie has but I would if possible.

And they are, musically and lyrically, passe for the new generation. But these artists, who take themselves very seriously, come apart as time moves on leading to tension between the band members in a tragically funny story line.What probably made this so terrific is that it was the first, an experiment by which numerous others (including themselves) have tried to reproduce - making a fake documentary about a real subject. And with some topics, especially artists and even moreso hard rock musicians, it's primed for satire. Remarkably, the actors are all skilled musicians and the music is fun, more than listenable and the lyrics are brilliant and clever.If you notice, this is the only movie rated out of 11.

I remember seeing it when it first came out, in one of those shoebox cineplexes that sprung up everywhere in the 80s. The audience--about 12 people--were evenly split between those of us who got the joke (yes, I WAS in that category) and some thick-as-a-brick metalheads who didn't and thought this was about a real band.

The film stars Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer as the main group members. What surprised me most about this film is that most of the films dialogue was improvised by Reiner, McKean, Guest, and Shearer. It works quite well throughout the film, as the jokes feel more organic and not staged. There's not much else to say about ""Spinal Tap"". It's a really clever movie that's modestly executed and it, in all honesty, pays off.

I will agree, however, with the other comments that it's ""showing it's age"", and that it does drag on at times (I had similiar feelings while watching Monty Python's ""Holy Grail"" and ""Life of Brian"", for example).Very few of the ""gags"" are going to walk right up and slap you in the face.

155,MrWhite2,One of the best Mockumentarys Ever Made! (spoiler?),9,20 February 2003,"This is one of the most hysterical movies ever made. Although, this isn't the best Christopher Guest written/starring in film, Waiting For Guffman and Best In Show were better. But this is still a comedy masterpiece that should be admired from all aspects of film making. Instead of Christopher Guest directing this like Waiting For Guffman and Best In Show, Rob Reiner (Misery, Stand by Me) directs this classic mockumentary/comedy that invented the movie genre, Rockumentary. The story is about a film maker (Rob Reiner) making a documentary of a british band full of idiots called ""Spinal Tap"". The band members contain two lead guitarists/singers, Nigel Tuffnel (Christopher Guest), David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean), and have one bass player Derek Smalls (Harry Shearer). The band keeps losing drummers to various accidents that result in death - one drummer explodes on stage, one dies in a gardening accident, and the funniest one - one dies by choking on vomit (as Nigel Tuffnel says, ""It wasn't his vomit, it was someone else's. Unfortunetly, they can't do DNA testing to find out who's it actually was.""). The film maker also explores David St. Hubbins's obnoxious and naive girlfriend, who is kind of like ""Yoko Ono"" and trys to tear David and Nigel apart. This is a film I would recommend to anyone looking for an excellent film to watch.

My only gripe that it wasn't long enough! The songs are quite funny, and ""Hell Hole"" could actually pass for a real 80's hit! I find it hysterical when people don't get the joke and say ""That band was the worst, it was terrible!"" Would you believe that when Steven Tyler saw it the first time, he didn't get it either. this movie is a total rip on the glam bands that were forming during the late 70's early 80's, most particularly Kiss. It also pounds on the Led Zeppelin docu-concert ""The Song Remains the Same"" with Nigel's guitar/violin solo.

Christopher Guest's character making dumb comments isn't that funny to me.Overall, I just found the nature of the movie to be too obvious of a mockery, if you know what I mean. It's even cut and edited in a way that doesn't feel natural as a documentary would. Maybe my personal enjoyment was affected because I've seen too many rockumentaries already, like 'Hail Hail Rock n Roll', 'Woodstock', 'Gimme Shelter' and 'Stop Making Sense', and most of the jokes and tropes just didn't seem all that witty or fresh when you can see all of the drama/backstage fighting for real by watching an actual doc.Oh well, maybe this is a reflection on how films with cult followings can be misleading, and the original responses are more accurate.",This Is Spinal Tap

But if you're looking for a light comedy that anyone can enjoy about our dim-witted, image conscious, world of sex, drugs and rock and roll, this is a fun comedic trip.In short - Britian's ""loudest"" band, known for the sexual bad-assery of the 60s, is trying to make a comeback in the more socially and politicially aware 80s in the US, where raw sexual innuendo which some may find degrading, especially to women, is no longer en vogue. Meet Marti di Bergi, documentary film maker who follows the band on tour to reconstruct the great (fake) history of this band through the ages, the friendship of long time band members, and the ongoing success story in the next era... or so they think.But our non-mean spirited band members are clueless that they have never grown up and evolved from the 60s and 70s and are still stuck in their own time warp of writing ""clever"" sexual innuendo songs and all sorts of fantasy that made for the 60s and 70s glam rock era. What was expected to be a whirlwind tour to tens of thousands of screaming fans turns into the tour spiraling ever downwards to new depths. The stars personalities get in each others way over time, exploring every rock-n-roll drama that many musicians are familiar in a very amusing way. Much of the lingo is extremely clever, musicians will pick up on many of the subtleties, those who don't might miss it and just be amused generally by the drama.I think what makes this film so much fun to watch is that there was no forced script. This was 3 actors who are musicians who lived, breathed, ate and slept in the UK and fully enveloped themselves in their bit parts, right down to the accents. The cameos of famous actors (many who weren't famous then) is mind boggling and each bit part from great talent is what makes this movie such a fun watch as a whole.Whether or not you appreciate this film, it is absolutely an icon of mockumentaries and the one that set them up. And quite a number of famous lines (not just ""these go to 11"") have become a part of the modern parlance. This is a regular rewatch, even just for the performances. Enjoy!",This Is Spinal Tap
163,edantheman,On the fine line between stupid and clever... kind of like lukewarm water,10,7 March 2007,"Not too long ago, my classmates and I were allowed to bring in a DVD of our choice as it was nearing the end of the school term. Knowing that these pop culturists wouldn't be too happy to watch one of my 'arty cult films', I didn't give a shite and brought in 'This is Spinal Tap'. They quite happily agreed to put it on after I told them it was funny and had swearing in it. But soon, boredom started to sink in with the class. ""Crap"", they labelled it. ""Boring"", they yelled. After less than ten minutes, my teacher was changing the disk to, wait for it 'The Others'. One of my chums, being a fan of the film, dismissed them as idiots. However, I told him it was all a matter of taste and that they would be much happier settling down to watch their 40-year-old virgins and American pies than this more subtly-coloured tin of paint. So as I walked over to the front of the classroom, tail between my legs, to pick up my DVD my teacher leaned over and said, ""Don't worry, I liked it. You have to be cultured to enjoy this sort of thing."" And you know what, she's right.To be quite frank, 'Spinal Tap' is just like marmite. You'll either love everything about it or hate every frame of it. Some people say it's like watching wet paint dry, others say it was so funny it gave them a hernia. I definitely fall into that latter category. After the umpteenth viewing, I still find it painfully hilarious!But that's not the only reason for seeing it. It's also a totally accurate, observational and witty deconstruction of rock's strutting pretensions. If you're someone who thinks rock bands take themselves far too seriously, you need this movie. If, on the other hand, you feel like rock stars should forever be treated like gods and worshipped on a regular basis, you might just want to avoid this. After all, when Aerosmith's Steven Tyler had finished watching it he said he just felt like he wanted to throw himself off a cliff! It reveals the utter shallowness of rock 'n' roll without even flinching!If you're also a lover of in-your-face laugh-out-loud got-it-straight-away humour, just stay away. Far, far away. This is intellectual stuff. You have to possess intelligence to enjoy it. I've never met any stupid people who did enjoy this film. Director Rob Reiner really shows how broad his range is with this (his best in my opinion!), bringing every authentic detail, no matter how seemingly minor, to the screen effortlessly with a wonderfully sharp cast. Its still a challenge to get my head around the fact that this is from the same tubby Santa Claus look-alike who made 'The Princess Bride' and 'Stand By Me'! Reiner has always been a man with extraordinarily wide horizons and always will be, constantly entertaining cinema-goers with so many different stories!The film's fly-on-the-wall mockumentary style works wonders, getting some beautiful performances from its actors (namely Michael McKean and Christopher Guest) and adding to its 'natural' feel. Many films, mainly British ones, have imitated this style ever since. Even one of the film's actors and co-writers has stuck to the hip of this film for the most part of his career, coming up with new and even more outlandish 'mockumentaries' to entertain and sate his legion of followers. On each viewing, you'll erupt into laughter at the discovery of a new joke. Then for weeks on end, you'll be quoting it to your friends and everyone you know. It's like a treasure trove without a bottom!To finish this not-so-critical analysis, I can never find any fault or flaw even after the innumerable viewings I've had. I never get bored of it either. I think the reason I like this so much is, honestly, because it was made for people like me!",This Is Spinal Tap

165,byght,A true masterpiece,10,8 April 2004,"A recent rewatching of one of my favorite films, ""This is Spinal Tap,"" after several years without seeing it, impressed upon me what a truly remarkable work it is.  While the latter-day Christopher Guest mockumentaries are great achievements unto themselves, make no mistake: the granddaddy (guided masterfully by Rob Reiner) is still the undisputed king of this smart, quirky brand of humor.Michael McKean and Guest are so tremendously sharp, so subtle yet so larger-than-life as the quintessential John-Paul/Mick-Keith duo of David and Nigel that the film COULD float along on their energy and tension alone. But this film has performance to burn--with Harry Shearer's dorky bassist Derek, Tony Hendra's pugnacious and believable manager Ian (the great forgotten performance of this film--you'd be surprised how many of the memorable moments revolve around Ian), June Chadwick's unspeakably pretentious Yoko-girlfriend Jeanine, and, of course, Reiner as supreme lamo documentarian Marti DiBergi.This isn't even to mention a series of inspired cameos by Billy Crystal, Paul Shaeffer, and Fran Drescher, among others (look for more of all of them in the extensive deleted scenes, which are a real joy unto themselves).Then there's the music.  Tap improbably spans the generations, from early Beatles/Stones Buddy Holly tribute rock to hippy-dippy psychedelia to adolescent sex metal (in a sense, the decline of Tap is the decline of rock 'n' roll itself).  The songs and musicianship are so stunningly good (even when corny, it's all so extraordinarily well done), which is an excellent example of what makes this film truly great: it recognizes that parody is no excuse for laziness.Hence the high standards of musicianship.  Hence the cleverly crafted songs that you almost expect to hear when you turn on the radio.  Hence the razor-sharp performances and unforgettable characters and relationships. Hence the compelling story, which is at more than one point sadder than it is funny.As it always does, ""Spinal Tap"" faded to black (a kind of pastel black) the other night after a blazingly quick and tight 82 minutes.  My friend, who had never seen it before, was mightily impressed.  But not as impressed as yours truly, who was probably watching it for the 12th or 13th time.It's time to stop calling Spinal Tap one of the greatest comedies of all time, one of the greatest mockumentaries of all time, one of the greatest rock 'n' roll films of all time.  The simple fact is, this is one of the greatest movies ever made, period.",This Is Spinal Tap

People who started off with Guffman, Show or even A Mighty Wind will be sorely disappointed as it is not nearly as funny or smart as these, but still worth the four or five really good moments in the movie.

168,SanderStrijbos,The best mockumentary ever!,10,7 March 2001,"This Is Spinal Tap (TIST) is the best mockumentary I've ever seen. It tops The Blair Witch Project and Man Bites Dog (two of my other favorite mockumentaries).I saw it the first time a couple of years ago and I thought it was a real documentary (I must have been 13 or something). Later I discovered that it was not.It's so brilliant and it has so many classic scenes (Stonehenge, the amplifier, etc.) that this is a classic. It is one of my favorite comedies of all time.TIST is about a hard rock band on their detour and should be a guide to everyone who wants to start a band. If you ever become like these guys, I have one thing to say: STOP YOUR CAREER!!When the manager is asked by the director if ST is on their detour, the manager says: No, they have a more selective audience.Just brilliant!I rate this one a 11 out of 10 (inside joke)",This Is Spinal Tap
169,someguy889,These go to eleven... number one cult movie,8,6 June 2004,"Rob Reiner used to be a good director back in the day, and he made two of the all-time cult classics, This is Spinal Tap and The Princess Bride in the 80s. In a recent poll in some magazine or other, This is Spinal Tap was named the number one cult movie of all time, beating out Harold and Maude, The Shawshank Redemption, Rocky Horror Picture Show, even Freaks. This mockrockumentary is brilliantly funny. Christopher Guest liked the mockumentary style so much that he would use it three more times with Waiting for Guffman, Best in Show, and A Mighty Wind. It is filled with incredibly funny situations... The Stonehedge Concert, not finding their way onto the stage, the concert for veterans, and of course, the ever famous Amplifier going to 11. It is a quietly loud movie, and it is full of fascinating characters, from Rob Reiner's director to the band made up of Michael Mckeon, Harry Shearer, and Christopher Guest, the funniest out of them, who is secretly in love with Michael's character. I didn't really laugh much out loud in this one, but the brilliance of This is Spinal Tap is something special, that is frequently attempted but never equaled. It deserves its cult status, and deserves its status as a great movie.My grade: 8/10",This Is Spinal Tap
170,adudewhoiscool,Hilarious- 11/11,10,22 August 2006,"I just saw ""This is Spinal Tap"" and I realized why this is a cult classic. You do not have to be in a band to enjoy this mock documentary (aka mockumentary), you just have to enjoy rock music and comedies. This film was the first of its kind, and it paved way for mockumentaries like ""Best in Show."" Since I enjoy rock music and comedies, I thought this was very hilarious. If you are older then the age of 25 and still have not seen ""This is Spinal Tap"" then I suggest you head to the nearest rental store and rent this because you do no know what you have been missing.Marti DeBergi (Rob Reiner) is most famous for making dog food and other type of commercials. He then decides to take a break from commercials to film a documentary, or rockumentary, on the band, Spinal Tap (a band that was created for this movie). This resulting rockumentary follows Spinal Tap as they make a comeback tour in America, following the band around on their fateful tour. This is the kind of tour where everything happens, and a lot of things goes wrong....several gigs gets called off, problems with their stage-show, conflicts between the members of the band, and so on. This showed the good and bad days of Spinal Tap and their many drummers.First off, because of this movie, a major part of life is now completed. With all of the pop culture references of today, I can now say that I understand where the jokes came from. From now on, when I listen to a radio station and I hear a ""This is Spinal Tap"" reference I will understand it. In fact, not only can I understand references but also I can make them myself. This is Rob Reiner's film directorial debut and it is wonderful for a debut. With the combination of Rob Reiner directorial style and the writings of McKean, Guest, and Shearer, this is brilliant satire. Michael McKean as David St. Hubbins, Christopher Guest as Nigel Tufnel, and Harry Shearer as Derek Smalls were wonderful as members of Spinal Tap. They were so convincing it is hard to realize that Spinal Tap was not a real band. This movie had so many classic scenes/lines, which I will not spoil for you; it would be hard to dislike this. There are even memorable cameo appearances by Billy Crystal, Dana Carvey, Fran Drescher, and Fred Willard.In conclusion, ""This is Spinal Tap"" is probably the funniest rock and roll comedies that I have seen. It is a shame this was not perceived well in theaters, but that is what makes this a cult. This certainly will receive repeat viewings from me and I do believe that I will not forget this movie in a long time.",This Is Spinal Tap
171,tony-clifton,The funniest movie ever made!!!,10,16 January 2005,"Absolutely hilarious. You must see this movie. The lines are great, the situations are funny. Totally enjoyable. Nothing more to say!! 10/10.There were so many great scenes, it's hard to mention a top one, but some of my favourites include the Stonehenge concert, and the concert where one of them gets stuck in the capsule. Everything was done so realistically it's like War of the Worlds with a rock band. Rob Reiner and the Cast are geniuses.

Every musician I have ever known has seen this film and loves it just as much as I do.  I am afraid that non-musicians, or at least those not into music will not appreciate this film's humor.  There are so many ""in"" jokes about the music industry, that people who only listen to the radio while driving their car will not ""get it"".For those of ""us"" who ""get it"", we realize that Rob Reiner, Michael McKean, and Christopher Guest have created a film that should be on display at the Smithsonian (or at least the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame).McKean, Guest, along with Harry Shearer have tricked many people into believing that they are a legitimate band.

174,Bologna King,About as Funny as Death of a Salesman,5,24 January 2001,"Here is the story of the members of a rock band who, because of their stupidity and wilful blindness, together with the lies and deception imposed on them by their manager, refuse to listen to record companies who don't back them up, critics who pan them, radio stations that won't play their music, promoters who cancel their gigs and fans who don't care any more. Over the course of the movie, their illusions are slowly and painfully stripped away, as they come face-to-face with themselves as has-beens and failures.  It's the same story as Death of a Salesman.  And about as funny.Rob Reiner has cleverly imitated the style of a documentary film, and the actors are all so extremely plausible in these roles that it comes as no surprise that many people watch this film without realizing that it is fiction or have become fans of a nonexistent group.  Read the other reviews if you don't believe this.  People regularly have to be told that this film is a joke, which means usually that it's not a very good joke.As a satire, this film also falls short.  If this imaginary group is held up to ridicule, Reiner has carefully insulated the entire music industry from that ridicule.  If Spinal Tap is ridiculous, the fact that everyone seems to reject them implies that the music industry is too savvy to be that ridiculous.  Satire that doesn't poke fun at real people isn't satire.There are occasional flashes of genuine brilliance, such as the amp that ""goes to 11"".  Unfortunately the film shies away from the absurdity of such concepts rather than exploiting them.  Having stated the concept it is then dismissed as something only Nigel Tufnel would be stupid enough to to think.Mostly, however, the film relies upon its uncanny resemblance to a real rockumentary to entertain.  There is no question that a really effective imitation can be very entertaining.  Ask anyone who has seen an Elvis impersonator.  Aficionados of the heavy metal genre will recognize a number of allusions to real musicians here, but such allusions will be lost on less well-informed viewers.You might think that the film might be an effective parody or caricature. But the illusion is too close to the reality--parody and caricature get their humour from grossly emphasizing some aspect of the thing imitated, like making Mick Jagger's lips the size of a football.  There is none of that here.In short, there is not sufficient humour to counterweigh the essentially tragic nature of the story presented.  There is, as you might say, a very fine line between tragedy and comedy.Watch it for the cleverness and the truly fine acting throughout, but not for laughs unless you like laughing at cripples.",This Is Spinal Tap
175,selfparody,Easily Rob Reiner's Best,9,18 April 2005,"Made in 1982, and the most one of the better anti-eighties movies made during the time, this movie is one that can make me smile even after a friggin disaster at work before it makes me start giggling. It, no matter what anyone tells me, easily kicks the ass of STAND BY ME, E.T., WHEN HARRY MET SALLY, THE PRINCESS BRIDE, MISERY, and all that other stuff. Reiner and his merry band of fake Brits changed the face of comedy... slightly... without making any money... well, f--k that, the movie kicks arse.

176,DavidPumpkins,The funniest film ever made?,10,13 March 2001,"This film is just fantastic, that is, if I should call it a film at all. For Rob Reiner's spot-on satire of the rock and roll industry is presented in mock documentary form, so it is really a rockumentary mockumentary. 
  Film director Marty di Bergi (Reiner) decides to make a film which chronicles the ups and downs of his favourite rock band, Britain's own Spinal Tap, who are about to embark upon a comeback tour to promote their new album ""Smell The Glove"" (previous albums included ""Intravenus de Milo""; ""The Gospel According To Spinal Tap"" and ""Shark Sandwich"").  The band consists of five members; Nigel Tufnel, lead guitar (Guest), David St. Hubbins, lead guitar/vocals (McKean), Derek Smalls, bass guitar (Shearer) and the three central characters are backed up by their bizarre keyboard player Viv and there latest drummer Mick Shrimpton.  The film documents how previous drummers met their grisly demise, whether it's choking on vomit (""They can't prove whose vomit it was""), through a bizarre gardening accident or simply exploding on stage (""There was just a little green globule on his drum stool"").Behind the scenes, Tap rely on manager Ian Faith (Tony Hendra) who has to organise their concerts (with little success) or deal with unpleasant hotel managers.  The band go through a number of different PR stunts to try and promote the album but sales are hindered by the cover.  The original, ""lurid"" cover was deemed sexist (""What's wrong with being sexy?"" Nigel remarked) and so a compromise was reached which saw the album cover being completely black, with no design or logo of any sort on it.  Nigel tried to look on the bright side of the dismal cover (""It's interesting though, because the question is: How much more black could this be and the answer is...none.  None more black..."").  Good-hearted PR man Artie Fufkin tries to organise an album signing which is also met with little success.  The band is beginning to fall apart, little by little and the arrival of David's girlfriend Jeanine is met with annoyance by Nigel, who proceeds to quit the band.  Is this the end of Spinal Tap?  You'll have to watch it and see.In between the vague plot, director di Bergi conducts interviews with the band and at one stage asks them about their reviews - ""The review you had on 'Shark Sandwich', which was just a two word review simply said 'Sh*t Sandwich'"".  Of course, we couldn't have a film about rock and roll without the music and we are treated to excerpts from a number of Tap's songs, including ""Tonight I'm Gonna Rock You Tonight"", ""Stonehenge"" (which features the smallest stone henge model you're likely to see - ""The problem was we had a model that was in danger of being crushed by a dwarf!""), ""Big Bottom"" and ""Heavy Duty"". There is also the mention of a song we don't actually get to hear, the imaginatively titled ""Reach Out When You Die In My Champagne.""The film is littered with a vast array of scenes and situations that you have probably heard of before; the opening stage pods which don't open, the custom made amps which go up to 11, not 10 (""Well, it's one louder, isn't it?"") and many more, there are too many to mention, really.If this enthusiastic review hasn't convinced you to see it, then I don't know what will, it is just hilarious, especially on numerous viewings, there is a lot you'll not pick up on at first.  The Special Edition DVD release also includes deleted footage and a commentary from the band which is just as funny as the film itself.See it for yourself and see what all I'm talking about and if you already have you'll know what I mean when I say this must be one of the funniest films ever made, perhaps even THE funniest.",This Is Spinal Tap

I was wrong. America has muscled in on this territory, and taken the crown.Even if you don't initially sympathise with the 4 characters, as most of the time they're idiots, you will by the end of the film, as they will have entertained you with their total inability to escape from their (each different) severley limited view of the world.

180,freenachos,It's One Louder,10,29 October 2001,"I wonder if the actors playing Nigel Tufnel, Derek Smalls and David St. Hubbins wandered the set without ever breaking character.  Christopher Guest, Harry Shearer and Michael McKean become their hard-rocking alter-egos for the documentary of a ficticious rock band.  They know their characters so well, that they even do performances and interviews (NPR's ""All Things Considered"" had a good one) as these characters.The movie features expected and unexpected cameos from Billy Crystal, Dana Carvey (a non-speaking mime), Fred Willard and Paul Schaffer in a story that spoofs every silly aspect of the rock star life.  It's so funny because it closely parallels the quirks of rock star lifestyle (as seen on TV, since I've never been one) and performances.  From the petty backstage gripes; such as improperly sized bread and bologna, to the grand failure of a melodramatic creative vision.  It takes all the crap you see on a ""VH1 Behind The Music"" and makes fun of it.The songs are hilarious, and the memorable lines will be quoted from now to eternity.I'd also reccomend ""Waiting For Guffman"" (a similar tale revolving around community theater in the fictional town of Blaine, MO) and ""Best in Show"". Both of these feature Fred Willard, who is hilarious, in a more visible role.  There's also a great Saturday Night Live skit you can probably find on any SNL Sports special.  It features Martin Short, Harry Shearer and Christopher Guest in the quest for a men's olympic synchronized swimming competition.But I digress...When I first saw Spinal Tap it took a day or two for me to realize how hilarious it was.  I noticed myself quoting lines, and finding parallels between the absurdity in the movie and absurdity in real life. It gets better every time I see it.Rock.",This Is Spinal Tap
181,freenachos,Smell the Glove!,10,5 November 2002,"The humor of ""This is Spinal Tap"" has a special time-release formula.  I didn't find myself rolling on the floor laughing the first time I saw this but as the day went on my friends and I couldn't stop recalling the dialogue.  This movie is a legend.     ""See Spinal Tap"" should be written in the dictionary next to satire. Lately satire has come to mean a simple mockery of pop-culture instead of ""human vice or folly attacked through irony, derision or wit"".  Movies like ""Scary Movie"" claim to be parodies or satire without even trying to be witty.  They just imitate something as opposed to commenting on it.  True satire takes a bit more work by the writers and will make you laugh much harder.   Spinal Tap gives you the absurdity of the rock and roll world, yet still respects the music.  I understood this when I saw a clip of the movie for the first time at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  It was the scene with amps that go to ""11"".  I couldn't stop thinking about that scene until I finally saw the movie.  Every aspect of the music world is lampooned; arrogance, absurdity, backstage crybabies, has-beenism, volume, even the Beatles.  This movie is quoted like the Simpsons, which isn't always good but certainly proof of legendary movie.  It's dry, deadpan humor and it may take a day to sink in but this movie is hilarious.",This Is Spinal Tap

183,GregRG,"""There's such a fine line between clever and stupid,"" and Tap finds it every time",10,1 May 1999,"""There's such a fine line between clever and stupid,"" says David St. Hubbins, Spinal Tap's lead singer, and this movie finds it each and every time.  Spinal Tap is the fake documentary of ""The sights, the sounds, the smells of one of England's loudest bands.""  They also happen to be one of England's (or anywhere's) worst bands, and they are on a fast decent to nowhere while promoting their album ""Smell the Glove.""One of the many, many delights of the film is in showing just how low the band goes (the lowest is being billed behind a puppet show at a local amusement park).  But this film gives so much more than that descent.  It truly has its pulse on the vast humor that stupidity can provide, and as it gives us a clueless and derivative rock band, the cleverness in how it brings us it's stupidity is never less than breathtaking.The film is only 82 minutes, which is hard to believe, given how many jokes, both subtle and not so subtle, are thrown at us.  It's like Airplane, except instead of giving us sight gags and groaners, it gives us biting sarcasm and brilliant insight into the worst that rock n' roll can provide. The amazing thing is that unlike Airplane, there isn't one miss in the bunch.  Every joke in this film is at least funny, and many need a stronger adjective to express it's level of humor.This film is in one way an attack on a Rock n' Roll industry that allows a band like Spinal Tap to hang around, inexplicably, for twenty years, but this film is in no way a great social commentary.  It is a spoof. Well, actually, that's not really accurate.  It is THE spoof.  Every one before and after it will inevitably be compared to it, and ultimately, unfavorably.This is Spinal Tap is now rightfully a comedy classic.  I dare say that only ""The Holy Grail"" compares in being the most quoted movie of all time (at least among the Gen X set).  It deserves its place.  In my viewing of over 2,000 films in my life, I not only say without hesitation that it is the funniest film I have ever seen, I probably won't ever see a funnier oneIf you have seen Spinal Tap once and strongly disagree, my advice is to see it again.  It will allegedly be in theaters next year.  Spinal Tap needs at least six viewings to fully appreciate all of its humor.

184,mateusolivotti,Spinal Tap!,9,28 October 2020,"This Is Spinal Tap is a mockumentary (fictional documentary) released in 1984. The film tells the story of the fictional British band Spinal Tap on their US tour.Many point to this film as ""one of the best comedies of all time"", but, as much as I really think a film is very funny, the point that most catches my attention is the part of the false documentary, it is amazing how the film succeeds perfectly reproduce a common documentary, it is not for nothing that many unsuspecting people confused the film with a real documentary at the time of its release, moreover. as much as it is a low budget film it is very well produced, in addition to all this, the film manages to perfectly blend humor with fake documentary, and all of his jokes work and many of these jokes (in fact almost all) were improvised by the actors .
The mockumentary genre already existed at the time, but it was this feature that popularized the genre and undoubtedly one of (perhaps the best) film of its kind, unfortunately the film was not very successful at the time, but a few years later with the commercialization of VHS, the feature won cult status, and finally had its genius recognized and in 2002 the film entered the collection of the Library of Congress of the USA of films that need to be preserved due to their extreme cultural and historical importance.
This Is Spinal Tap is a historical film, funny and very well produced and acted, I recommend to everyone to see.",This Is Spinal Tap
185,Alligator_80,Rock 'N' Roll Comedy that goes up to eleven!,8,1 June 2007,"As is the case with half of the cult classics, they perform poorly at the box office, but thanks though to the advent of home video, they finally find an audience. This Is Spinal Tap is one of those movies. Poor box office takings can be attributed to such things as poor advertising, the movie itself being a dud or even being released at the wrong time to the wrong audience. In the case of This Is Spinal Tap, many failed to realize that it was a comedy, or specifically speaking, a mockumentary (fake documentary). This was a relatively new genre for that era, and not many audiences were attuned to that type of cynical comedy with its improvised comic realism.Soon after being released on home video, audiences began to realize the humour they had missed on the big screen. The makers of the film obviously followed the history of rock, as virtually everyone is satirized from Van Halen to Aerosmith to The Who and even The Beatles. Some memorable gags include Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest) playing the guitar with his feet, his piano ballad entitled ""Lick My Love Pump"", the drummer who spontaneously combusts on stage and of course, the amps which go to eleven. Such is the impact of the mockumentary that it has been referenced in everything from The Simpsons, Buffy, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City and even Spiderman 3. Much like The Rutles, which served as one of Spinal Tap's biggest influences, the film has its share of memorable cameos including, but not limited to Anjelica Huston, Dana Carvey and Billy Crystal.The humour worked well, in fact maybe too well. After drumming its way on the big screen, rock 'n' roll would never be the same again and Heavy Metal's seventh grade lyrics, amongst other things, could no longer be taken seriously. Now there's quality comedy!",This Is Spinal Tap

However, having observed a number of people being forced by their friends (such as myself) to watch this movie, I have learned that it's mostly hilarious for anyone who's ever been involved in any aspect of the music industry or any other performance-related show business, and that it's especially hilarious for these people when they've also grown out of a nigh-religious following of head-banging rock 'n' roll.  If you've never participated in any way in a band tour (and I mean any band of any kind; they really are all the same in ways that matter), you won't get a third of it.

There was discussion after the film as to whether the band was real or not. It seemed obvious to me at the time that it was a mockumentary, but there was a musician in the crowd who'd seen Nigel Tufnel on the cover of Guitar Player magazine. Almost 20 years later, the movie still stands as a masterpiece. Guest's later Waiting for Guffman and Best in Show, and I'm sure the upcoming A Mighty Wind, are also very well done, but the music in Spinal Tap is what sets it apart. The DVD is nice, but I was disappointed by the commentary by the guys in character. I'd rather have had something more substantial. If you haven't seen the movie, see it now!",This Is Spinal Tap

199,snorlax3111984,Pros and Cons of This Is Spinal Tap,10,13 April 2017,"Pros 1. This movie is full of memorable quotes like Nigels ""there's such a thin line between clever and stupid"" or Spinal Tap manager Ian hand-waving the band's decreasing turnout at concerts by explaining Spinal Tap's appeal is just becoming selective.2. This movie has some of the funniest visual gags I've ever seen like the disastrous Stonehenge model in danger of being squashed by a Dwarf or Derek being trapped in a pod.3. The soundtrack is phenomenal: for a fake band they sure put real effort into the songs and they're all good. 4. The Spinal Tap 3 all work well together and have great chemistry. It's no wonder the 3 have continued to work together, not just as Spinal Tap but also in Christopher Guest mockumentaries. 5. The movie has great brief appearances from people like Fran Drescher, Bruno Kirby, Billy Crystal, Howard Hesseman, Paul Benedict (Spinal Tap was released during The Jefferson's 10th and penultimate season) and Paul Schaffer (reuniting with Harry Shearer after they were SNL cast members in the Fall 1979 - Spring 1980 season).6. Best Line Derek: (after a big argument about a poorly-designed Stonehenge model caused the manager to quit the band) Can I raise a practical question at this point? Are we going to do Stonehenge tomorrow? David: No we're not f---ing going to do Stonehenge!Cons 1. I never understood the logic of the director asking David & Nigel if they're racist since they're music is usually only favored by Caucasians. That makes as much sense to me as asking the CEO of Toys R Us if he's prejudiced against adults because his company's products are popular with children.2. During the Stonehenge argument, Ian is listing all the things he does for the band and one of them is ""prizing rent from the local Hebrews"". I know he's upset about being nagged by the other guys but that's not an excuse for using this tired anti-semitic stereotype about Jews being obsessed with money and charging excessively high rates.3. When Janine butts in to the Stonehedge argument, Ian responds ""this is a band meeting, is she now part of the band?"" If the meeting is band only, why is the film crew allowed to attend?",This Is Spinal Tap
200,Drew-36,The satire is razor sharp!,7,21 March 1999,"The definitive Rock satire. This hilarious pseudo-documentary is all about a British rock group (Spinal Tap), and it spoofs everything, from the spontaneously combusting drummers to the amplifier that goes to 11, not 10. This rockumentary is a classic, watch it and get converted.",This Is Spinal Tap
201,mario10zeus,Quite funny indeed,8,15 July 2008,"After watching ""This is Spinal Tap"", I have added Christohper Guest's other films to my Netflix Queue. This mockumentary captures many aspects of modern rock from a sarcastic view. Being that it is done in a documentary style makes it even funnier than if it were a movie, say like ""Rockstar"" with Mark Wahlberg (haven't seen it yet, so I I'm not aware if its comedy or drama). Since TIST was released in 1984, it doesn't include the alternative rock period, nor the current indie rock nor sub-divisions such as emo, brit-pop, industrial, etc. Hair metal and spandex are widely lampooned, especially in the ""cucumber scene"". The Stonehenge scene along with the midgets had me falling over the floor in laughter. This ancient Britain dictum is a swipe at Led Zeppelin's black magic along with Manowar's knight cult. The vacuous song-writing is even prophetic as it resembles the songs from many late 80s bands (e.g. Rock me like a Hurricane from Scorpions, I want Rock n' Roll from Joan Jett, and anything from KISS). Finally, the scene where the rockers snub their New York limo driver due to his appreciation for Sinatra is utter genius. I think the writers could have explored more the themes or drug use and groupies, of course from a humorous POV.",This Is Spinal Tap
202,shadock-2,Seriously funny,8,9 February 2001,"If you didn't recognize many of the actors, you would be excused for thinking this was a real documentary.  The action seems spontaneous and even thought this feature could be described as having reverse dramatic irony (the actors know what's happening but we don't) or elements of a Greek tragedy (the actors know what's going to happen, but can't prevent it), the fact you know its not a real documentary doesn't detract from the movie's charm.  The actors treat their roles with utter seriousness - this is not an ""Airplane"" style spoof of the genre, and as a result, the humour runs the gamut from the sublime (the band members acting genuinely confused about why their mock bondage album cover ""Sniff the Glove"" might be deemed sexist) to the drop dead funny (midgets dancing around desperately undersized replicas of Stonehenge).The movie also walks a fine line between the scripted plot and much of the improvised dialogue.  We have a group of actors here so skilled in improvisation that its scary how they can't be thrown by the reactions of their fellow actors.  However, despite this, the characters are totally consistent and often easy to understand and empathize with. 
All in all, instead of having a comedy with funny line or slapstick, we have one that puts the actors in an otherwise tragic situation and uses their own denial about it to draw the humour out.  We laugh because we foresee the decline and fall of Spinal Tap, we know the actors know whats coming, but still their characters, in the face of all evidence to the contrary, believe that the iceberg will somehow move out of the way before the ship hits it.",This Is Spinal Tap

The cast works well together, they feel like a real band and no matter how far out they are you know that there are bands out there like that. Harry Shear seems to be man out  although it does fit the bass player mould.  David St. Hubbins (Michael Mckean is great and has some wonderful lines.  But Chris Guest steals the show as the guitar player Nigel.  The catering scene before a concert, talking about his Skelton shirt, showing his guitars and amps to Rob Riner, everything is just too much to list.

I won't spoil any of the great gags, but I will say it involves close attention and repeat viewings to get many of the jokes before they happen.  Derek Smalls, Nigel Tufnel, and David St. Hubbins are Spinal Tap (along with drummer Mick Shrimpton and clueless keyboarder Viv Savage) and play many ludicrously titled ""hits"" during the film with hilarious results.

I wonder how many of these pretty little girly men have affected an English accent? And if they are not really popular, where their music and performing makes them enough money to live on, to buy some insularity, where do they go when they are not on stage or rehearsing indoors ""with the lads""? I would not want to go out to the grocery store or hardware store or any other place looking like that. Surely, in those getups, you'd be inviting an ass-kicking, would you not?
That's what always amazed me about the Rolling Stones: Jagger played the part of the tough ""Street-Fighting Man"", but at the same time the little twerp, who weighed, what, about 140, would prance around in his capes and makeup like a bleeding fairy. But I liked the Stones for years anyway (but not now because they are too old and make too much money for playing music that they played 30+ years ago; it's a disgrace and they should be ashamed). Unlke most of us, and like the Stones, Spinal Tap didn't have to face any of this aggro because they, at least at one time, could fill stadiums! And in this movie they are running on the fumes of their previous success.
Sorry about the digression. EVERYTHING about this movie is perfect. I was raised on rock (Stones, Beatles, Jeff Beck, The Who, Rod Stewart, Ten Years After, Blodwyn Pig, King Crimson, etc.) and this music and its practitioners had been screaming out for parody. Thank God that mssrs. Guest, McKean, Reiner, et.al. have done it up right. The endless series of exploding drummers, the choking on SOMEONE ELSE'S vomit, the fatal gardening accidents, the hissy fit over the dressing room refreshments, Fred Willard, the one-foot actual size reproduction of Stonehenge, Derek being trapped in the plastic pod, Paul Shaffer's character begging them to kick his ass, the manager, the girl friend, the songs, the lyrics, the accents.

206,Yodelling Llama,Subpar Mockumentary,6,29 October 2002,"As a huge fan of the mockumentary genre (e.g. Zelig, Bob Roberts, Best in Show), I was heartily looking forward to This Is Spinal Tap.  Unfortunately, the film did not live up to my expectations.  While there are a few good gags (although most have already been heavily sampled by sketch comedy shows and repeated ad naseum by too-young-for-Python-quoters), it is on the whole a dull and lackluster affair.  While I applaud Reiner, Guest, McKean and Shearer for attempting something truly great, I cannot join others in heralding its execution.  The songs are at the same time lacking in believability and too close to the source material.  The strife between the band members is overly predicable, with an irritating and chuckle-free Yoko character parading around in `Australian nightmare outfits' and a series of thinly veiled nasty cracks at the late great Keith Moon.  And though it obviously is the model of virtually all of VH1's original programming (e.g. Behind the Music), it does come to a trite and cloying faux-happy ending that puts the Air `thank God Kurt Cobain shot himself' Supply story to shame.  I was pleased to see a youthful Dana Carvey as a mime waiter, and Bruno Kirby gushing over Sinatra, but even an endless supply of pleasant cameos does not a movie make (a lesson Loaded Weapon 1 taught us so well). On the whole, while I might recommend This Is Spinal Tap as an important piece of cinema history, I would not have placed it anywhere near the top 100 comedies of all time.",This Is Spinal Tap

When I was 12 or 13, my brother rented it and we watched it 3 times in the same day. At first, I hated it because I didn't know any better, and my brother never ""helped"" me figure out why it was funny. The second time I watched it, I ""got it"" and have never been the same person ever since.First off, the entire film is ad-libbed except for the songs and a few lines; which is the reason that people are talking over each other a lot, requiring repeated viewings to catch everything. It is in documentary format, so it all works for this type of film. The songs are hysterical but catchy at the same time, just like real 80's arena rock and hair metal (well some of it). It certainly helps to be a fan of the rock genre to enjoy the film, or you will miss out on some significant references and the basis for each of the band members.There are no dull moments in this brisk, 82-minute film, and the sheer number of hysterical cameos (including Fran Drescher, Billy Crystal, Bruno Kirby, Howard Hesseman, Paul Shaffer and Anjelica Huston) kicks the film up to 11 as they all put in stellar performances.This film should be in the Top 100, no question.

I thought that the music I held sodear was being mocked and relegated - another attempt by myparents to subvert my love of the music that ""parents don'tunderstand"".  A few years later I watched it again and realized thatmy dad wasn't making fun of me, he was trying to show me how tolaugh at myself.  I am a musician and have been professionally foryears now.  I look back at that first viewing with a laugh now. This Is Spinal Tap is so funny because it is not only funny as hell,but a loving tribute to the culture of my youth.

It is a hilarious comedy, the music is excellent, the concept is fantastic, and it is a wonderfully accurate spoof as well.The preparation which went into this film included going on tour with the band Saxon, which allegedly inspired the superb sequence where the band gets lost backstage on tour.  Although Status Quo claim the film was based on them, it was from the Saxon tour that much of the detail was taken.The characters, though, are quintessentially British.  David St. Hubbins, Nigel Tufnel (whose amplifiers go up to 11 instead of the usual 10) and Derek Smalls are archetypes of faded British rock musicians desperately trying to be cosmopolitan in an industry dominated by bigger, bolder, louder Americans.If you are a rock fan you will laugh long and loud at this film.

213,WesAndersonFan,Overrated,6,25 June 2003,"Rob Reiner's ""This is Spinal Tap"" is perhaps one of the most overrated films I've seen. Despite the talent of Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer, and the apperances of many actors who would appear in the great mockumentaries directed by Guest (""Waiting for Guffman"", ""Best in Show"", and ""A Mighty Wind""), this film is a bore most of the way through. Certain moments are of interest, such as when the rock group played by the three actors can't find their way to the stage and when one of the members is showing a stereo with 11 being the highest number. But this mockumentary is horrible when compared to the mockumentaries Christopher Guest would later make. The reason why this film to me is a failure is very simple: Rob Reiner. I haven't seen a film of his yet, where he doesn't sell out to Hollywood. Guest doesn't sell out and his film, and remains at top to the end.

All the leads are superb, the shortest of cameos are amazing. The music rocks and is funny as! The drummer motif is excellent. If you have ever been in a band, you will recognise and love this.

This was originally a 4 1/2 hour movie, that was cut down to a 82 minute film. Tons of scenes were taken out, and in my opinion, Reiner took out too many. Some of the funniest scenes are in the deleted extras. For example, an interview with Billy Crystal as the head-mime was hilarious. Bruno Kirby, the bands limo driver, falls into peer pressure with the band. Nigel and the boys get him high off dope, and Kirby ends up in his underwear singing Frank Sinatra.

Spinal Tap is five guys who, given their apparent songwriting and performing talent, take themselves _way_ too seriously. I mean, how serious can you be if you've written songs called ""Sex Farm"" and ""Big Bottom"" (not to mention ""Tonight I'm Gonna Rock You (Tonite)"")? Note to the uninitiated: ""Big Bottom"" is _not_ about bass drums.There isn't a scene in this film that doesn't absolutely slay me. I also have the soundtrack album, which has a featureless black cover (if you've seen the movie, you'll understand). Spinal Tap's ""comeback"" album and concert video from 1993, ""Break Like the Wind,"" is okay but not anywhere near as funny as the original.My favorite line from the film is uttered by David St. Hubbins:""It's such a fine line between stupid and clever.""Yes it is, David, but this film stays firmly on the clever side.",This Is Spinal Tap

I've known several people that couldn't understand why they went to the trouble of making a movie about a band that no one had ever heard of... that says more about the viewers than about the movie.

221,Chris Brown,These jokes still work,8,6 April 2008,"You don't have to be a rock historian to know that the days of explicit rap were preceded by an era where rock musicians celebrated sex with song lyrics containing clever (and sometimes unintentionally hilarious) sexual metaphors and innuendo. That's why the songs in ""This is Spinal Tap"" can still make young audiences laugh.This movie is made to look like a documentary which chronicles the tour of Spinal Tap, an aging rock band whose popularity is waning. The hilarious dialogue is often partially improvised. Much of the humor is built around the characters being totally oblivious to the ridiculousness of what they are saying or doing. If you've ever seen VH1's ""Behind The Music,"" you will notice that this movie pokes fun at all the themes of the rockstar existence, except (surprisingly) drug use.The humor is subtle compared to movies such as Wedding Crashers or almost any Martin Lawrence movie, wherein the characters are often telling jokes instead of unknowingly just being a joke. But for people who ""get"" subtle humor, Spinal Tap will have you rolling on the floor at times.For the same brand of humor and much of the same cast, check out ""Best in Show"" and ""Waiting for Guffman.""

Yet the band members go virtually unfazed by these major indications of their decline due largely to the reassurance of their manager. His reassurances that the bands is still great are almost as funny as the problems the band is experiencing,  but in reality they are a long way from the moderate success they once had.

232,arodmitton,A must see for those who take themselves too seriously...,8,27 February 2012,"Fame is fleeting. This eye-opening ""rockumentary"", as the film's director Marti DeBergi, calls it, chronicles British rock band, Spinal Tap, self-proclaimed as ""the world's loudest band"", as they embark on an American tour, and come to find out that hard truth. Being the biggest band in the world during the 1960's, this documentary follows the band during their 1984 tour, and DeBergi captures the raw truth of what it is like to be a rock band in decline.Of course, that is just the storyline of the film. This is Spinal Tap pioneered the ""mockumentary "" movement in American film, and actually had quite a few people fooled into thinking that this was a real band. The band members, David St. Hubbins, Nigel Tufnel, and Derek Smalls (played by Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer, respectively), come to find out that their fame isn't what it used to be, as they plod along the tour dealing with small half-filled venues, canceled shows, being second billed to a puppet show, and even playing to an army base on leave that was more reminiscent of a bad company Christmas party. Lampooning is in full effect here as the film is a parody of gigantic, over-the-top rock bands and their pretentious lyrics, overblown stage props, and overall inability to see the truth about themselves and their level of cultural importance.Just about every scene is memorable and quotable (i.e. the famous ""it goes to 11"" bit, Derek Smalls getting trapped in a stage prop, the Stonehenge concert scene, getting lost backstage, etc.). The clever writing is actually credited to the stars of the film and all act their part wonderfully. It was due to their acting ability, coupled with Reiner's ability to make a fake documentary, that people actually believed that the band was real. June Chadwick also turned in a great performance as Jeanine Pettibone, the proverbial ""Yoko Ono"" of the band. This film was also filled with cameos from Bruno Kirby, to Billy Crystal, to Fred Willard, all of whom contributed their own unique style to this film. The direction by Rob Reiner was also great in this movie. Even though I knew that this was a fake band, I couldn't help feeling sorry for them at times as their reality ""caves-in"" on them and the band is faced to force the reality of their situation.This is Spinal Tap did pioneer the ""mockumentary"", as several others followed in its footsteps, however, I don't think that any will have the impact that Spinal Tap did. The success and fanfare following this film is so large, that the fake band has even released music albums, gone on tours, and the actors have reprised their roles several times in the last 27 years, including a guest spot on the Simpsons, of which Shearer is a regular cast member. This is Spinal Tap is a wonderfully made film that most should take the time to see. I say most, because, I believe that as a pre-requisite to watching this film, you have to be somewhat familiar with rock music and rock stars. But overall, I would definitely recommend this film for those that need a good laugh, or maybe those that take themselves just a little too seriously8/11",This Is Spinal Tap
233,richrodi,It's called lick my love pump!,10,9 December 2008,"A mockumentary about the trials and tribulations of an 80's band past their prime. Rob Reiner directs and acts as the director of this fake film. He introduces us to the world of Spinal Tap. Spinal Tap as a band and a movie emulates the flair and absurdity of a classic rock band as they try to adapt to the pop and glitter of the 80's. We follow them as they try to keep face as they are constantly discouraged by their embarrassing moments. These moments manifest themselves throughout the movie in the form of failed cover art, getting stuck in an alien pod prop and getting stood up at their own record signing. What is most impressive about this film is the acting and song writing abilities of the cast and crew. The acting in itself is an extraordinary feat because these actors must not only act as if they were these enigmatic rock stars but they must also act as if they were these grandiose rock stars being put in front the camera lens. The third wall is broken and at certain points the camera crew themselves are interacted with. This self reflexivity combined with the great musical talent and catchy songs this film produces creates a situation in which a perfect film of the rise and fall of a fictitious absurd rock band displays their musical and acting gumption on the screen",This Is Spinal Tap

235,pankaj-kalwani-1,Not funny...Maybe it's a European thing...1/10,1,16 February 2005,"I remember seeing this movie as a child but did not remember anything about the movie and now I know why.Having read great reviews about it and it's status as IMDb's Top 250 movies, I decided to see it again and man was I disappointed. That's the reason I rate this movie 1/10 to bring it's overall rating down.Before I badmouth the movie, let me tell some good things about it. It is a clever and subtle comedy kinda like ""Curb your Enthusiasm"" although not half as good. Clever because you might be fooled into thinking it is a real band if you've never heard anything about the movie. It is not your average belly laugh comedies. However, I did smile in some of the scenes like the song Gimme some money, the miniature bread scene, Nigel's stupid stunts and accidents on stage, the HUGE :-) Stonehenge monument and the band getting lost backstage.Here's what I disliked. I was expecting a COMEDY for crying out loud. And I'm just waiting for a funny moment to arrive. All those stupid gags and dumb jokes and situations are so bland and tedious to watch. It gets too repetitive and uninteresting. I don't know, maybe its a European or American thing but this is not my idea of a funny movie. And what more can I say...even the makers of the movie knew that the jokes were so not funny that all those cameos had to be used...and still, to no good result.My recommendation...If u want a comedy movie on rock n roll watch ""School of Rock"". If you want to watch one of Rob Reiner's better movies watch ""When Harry Met Sally... "". If you still like to watch a music mockumentary go for ""Fear of a Black Hat"" (6/10) based on rap music. However, if u still want to watch this movie do not expect a lot. It is just a clever, not so funny movie",This Is Spinal Tap
236,tk-93740,Hilarious,8,23 November 2018,"I really loved the deadpan delivery of all the jokes, and the short length of the movie makes it so it never feels like jokes are repeated too much and the movie never feels like it's dragging on too long. My favorite joke is probably the one where Nigel is playing the classical song on the piano, and talks about it for a few minutes, and then at the end when the guy asks him what it's called he says ""Lick My Love Pump"" hahaThe one where the bassist (I think it was the bassist) was trying to go through the metal detector was also incredibly hilarious, just like most of the jokes in this movie.

237,thing-16,Brilliant Satire,9,20 April 2006,"Back in the 70's and 80's, rock and roll was getting out of hand. Everyone wasted it bigger and better...but in the end everything just got expensive and cheap. Stage shows were fun to go to but were so cheap and cheesy you had to wonder why you would watch it in the first place.Rob Reiner and 3 clever British comedians seemed to have noticed this and created their own band-Spinal Tap-that was a satire of the whole hair band and metal craze going on in the time. And they captured everything. Well, almost at least.This may be one of the most quotable movies ever. No line is out of place here. Everything has a purpose, and nothing is FORCED upon you, like in some comedy movies. However there may be a bit of a problem understanding Spinal Tap's British accents. So watch it on DVD-subtitles are a life saver.If you don't find this even slightly amusing, I don't know about you. The actors emotions are portrayed through improvisation and are incredibly real. It seems like an actual documentary (which it is not-its a mock rockumentary) and as a result seems real...seems like a real band, going through real problems. If you know anything about 70's and 80's metal, this movie holds something for you. If you've played an actual gig, it holds even more. But if you have no clue, watch it anyways.

Theres the horrible lyrics, the hair, the drugs, heck theres everything that described the 80's ballad bands.Pros: Absoultely hilarious. Very witty funny. The actors wrote their own lyrics and sang thier own songs which i'm very impressed by. Great story that actually made sense. Great acting, it made you feel like it was a real doucmentary. Each character is richly created throughout the movie and has a very memorable cast. Had the ""documentary style cenimatography"" which made it even more hilarious.Cons:If your a fan of the 80's bands (ie Van Halen, Def Leppard) you may not like this movie. Wish they had gotten in more depth with the Keyboardist. I think that character coulda been really funny. Thats pretty much all the cons.DVD (special edition): Great for it's price of 20 dollars. Comes with director commmentary along with the cast. Outakes, 4 music videos. Tons of extra footage. This is a DVD that gives a bang for your buck.Overall: Very funny movie, should be watched with a group of friends.

Truly a good comedy and spoof on this idiotic characteristics of the egotistical musician. The lead guitar player (I'm not sure of his name) did SUCH a great acting job. He was hilarious!! And, believe it or not, these far-feched scenarios that you find this band in are not so far-feched at all. Trust me!! Musicians truly are the most interesting and bizarre species on this earth, and Spinal Tap takes that fact and spins it in such a comical direction as to make it the cult classic that it is today. I would have to say that not EVERYONE would like this movie (my girlfriend hated it) but if you're a musician, if you are a music lover, if you're a rodey, manager, past musician, groupie, sound editor, record producer, recording engineer, etc., SEE THIS MOVIE!!!",This Is Spinal Tap

Michael McKean, one of my very favorite actors, hadn't had this big of a break since the role of Lenny Kosnowski on ""Laverne and Shirley"". Very different roles, yet he was still the same person.

245,michaelthonger,Most overrated film of all time,3,19 July 2010,"I saw this for the first time the other day- I've been wanting to see it for ages, and saw it going for £3 in HMV (the 'up to 11' edition DVD). Having heard about how it's the greatest comedy film of all time and how it's an absolute classic, I was keen to have a laugh and see something I've never seen before; and, at risk of being flamed by fans, it SUCKED!! My first warning signs came when there's a whole minute and a half of a black screen before the menu, with four monotonous voices talking about how the screen is black. It wasn't funny, not even for its 'WTF factor'!I managed to chuckle about three times (the stonehenge bit, the 'trapped in the pod' bit, and the tight trousers scenes- three funny moments; three stars. That's generous) over this incredibly short film, but the entire film was the exact same joke (that they're idiots and they're not very popular) played out over and over again. I've heard that 90% of this is improv- and it FEELS like improv. Poorly done improv. I've done improv work on stage before- an idiot is by far the easiest character to improvise for, because you can be as slow as you want, and you just have to say random stuff and pretend you don't understand things to get laughs. A 13 year old could come up with better lines- when I was in primary school, I was pretending to confuse 'sexist' and 'sexy'. The best bits by far were the scripted parts- the concerts and such.However, this film has loads of fans, so I can only deduce that these are people who saw it when it was new, and it just hasn't aged well. I've seen almost all of the gags done elsewhere- Spinal Tap probably did it first, but other shows/mockumentaries do it better. The worst parts are plodding scenes of inane talking that leave you confused, wondering if what you just saw was supposed to be funny or not. It's not that I 'didn;t get it'- I got the jokes, they just weren't that funny- far too obvious for my liking. There was no subtlety in it at all- what you see is what you get. There's no plot to speak of, but a series of gags crudely stitched together, with more cul-de-sacs and pointless story arcs than your average episode of Family Guy. Maybe it was the hype. Maybe I was expecting too much from the 'greatest comedy of all time', but I absolutely hated it.

The list goes on and on and on - as far as the review can see. The Stonehenge debacle influenced the Block Sobboth to attempt a similar stunt with even worse results. The Isle of Luci festival was one of the most important in rock history and Spinal Tap was not only there - but they stole the show! To display the versatility of the brilliant band members: The 2 lead-singer-songwriters St. Hubbins/Tufnel have gone on to read poetry for audiobooks and direct several major motion pictures.

Almost the whole time I watched this movie I considered turning it off and staring at the white wall behind my tv, cause in doing that I could at least picture a funny movie in my head.  Please, oh please don't tell me ""you must not have a good sense of humor"" either, cause I know at least 50 people that have only met me once or twice that could tell you otherwise.  I will admit that for its purpose this movie is done well, and I would have liked to have given it a 3 or 4, but I really thought it was necessary to do all I could to lower its standing on the IMDB board, so I gave it a 1.",This Is Spinal Tap

The most memorable scene is the cucumber in the pants at the airport.I would recommend this to people that like comedies and parody movies. the ending made me feel good about the movie because it did not have one of those stupid lazy endings that was made with no thought. instead it had a decent ending that showed they put some effort into it, while having fun.",This Is Spinal Tap

If you don't know about this movie, it is about a rock band and there last ""great"" tour in which they get to learn they are not quite the HUGE rock band they were last time they came to the states. Many funny lines... many memorable things... and the DVD is excellent as far as features, including a full length commentary by the band.  If you haven't seen it and you like mockumentary style movies.... go get/see this one right away. It is far more well-rounded and simply the best of the mockumentary movies made since - more energentic, more varied in humor, more original, etc. One very under appreciated scene (in the special features) includes Bruno Kirby, Frank Sinatra and a pizza crust.

This documentary about the fictional band ""Spinal Tap"", contains interviews and other hilarious dialog's throughout the movie. I think my favorite part may have been after the Stonehenge show...""I do not for one think that the problem was that the band was a little out of key, I think the problem may have been that we had a Stonehenge that was in danger of being trampled by a dwarf!"" Other parts in the movie that I found to be rather entertaining were the parts where Nigel was being interviewed, and he showed the guitar that had never been played (No! Don't touch it! Don't even point at it!) and the amps that go to eleven. All in all, I must say this was an exceptionally hilarious movie.",This Is Spinal Tap

I don't want to give it away, but I'll just say that it is one of the best uses of the commentary track I have seen on any DVD.The movie has its rough spots but overall is very funny and has many lasting jokes.

Sure, there are things that you will laugh at during your first viewing of the film.  But as you keep watching it, you keep finding new things that weren't funny at first, but now that you think about it... that's genius, man!Absolutely brilliant performances in this movie all 'round.  Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer are so convincing, that you almost forget that it's just a movie.  Great acting, great music, and quotes that you'll be reciting for years to come.",This Is Spinal Tap
261,senor_herer,I think it would sound better in Dubly .......,10,9 May 2002,"** NO SPOILERS ** Put simply, this is probably the best satire ever made and certainly one of the funniest films you will ever see, no exaggeration. Spinal Tap is also that rare commodity, a comedy that actually gets funnier the more you watch it. Spinal Tap is one of those films, like Withnail & I, that has attained absolute cult status and is undoubtedly more popular today than it ever was on it's theatrical release. As far as I can see, the only impediment to enjoying this film would be if you have no recollection of (or knowledge of if you're a younger film fan) the heady, mulleted days of 80's heavy metal.As with all spoof documentaries, the very best are those which manage to combine hilarious satire in a film which is so well made you could actually almost be convinced it was real. This is doubtless helped not only by the charismatic performances of the main trio of the band, but also by the fact that the whole film is never played for laughs - the quality of the script and the deadpan performances are what really make this so funny. This is clever stuff indeed and if there is any lesson to be learnt it's that 99% of musicians, much like film stars, are often spoilt, self-indulgent little children who really are not worthy of the adulation they receive (just in case you really needed reminding). I have deliberately not revealed much about the plot or gags because they really are best seen for yourself (also, you will find yourself repeating them ad nauseam between friends and colleagues for years to come). The performances are stunning throughout and the fact that three main stars of the group (Tufnell, St. Hubbins and Smalls) actually played and recorded the songs featured in the film adds immeasurably to the experience. The lyrics of the songs themselves are enough to have you falling out of your seat and ""killer"" tracks like ""Stonehenge"", ""Big Bottom"", or ""Rock 'n' Roll Creation"" will forever more be indelibly etched onto your brain. I really can't recommend this movie highly enough. Only those people who still think mullets, leather jackets and spandex trousers are cool should avoid this film. Everyone else - jump aboard, you won't regret it (And if you get the Special Edition DVD, you are treated to an audio commentary by the film's stars, in character, that is almost as funny as the main feature). 10 out of 10 - No doubt about it - Rob Reiner's finest hour. As a final point, if you are one of those afore-mentioned people who has no knowledge of 80's heavy metal, the film CB4 is as close as you will ever get to a hip-hop equivalent (which although entertaining is not in the same league as Spinal Tap) and may prove more approachable for younger viewers or those who really can't stand wailing guitars.",This Is Spinal Tap
262,mlzema,Spinal Pap Rules!,10,6 June 2006,"No need to repeat all of the kudos which are much better said in the other reviews. I direct your attention to two of my favorites scenes, both of which I can only assume are brilliantly ad-libbed: the interview scenes near the beginning of the movie in which one of Tap's albums titled ""Shark Sandwich"" is reviewed simply as ""Shit Sandwich"" (among other funny lines) and the scene where Nigel shows off his incomparable collection of guitars to Marty DiBergi, in which Marty is instructed, nay, WARNED to ""don't even look at"" one of Nigel's prized axes. The classic bit about the amps that ""go to 11"" has long passed into the subconscious of nearly every person over the age of 25 (my 15 year old daughter even gets it), but it is still funny every time I see or hear it. The songs ""Sex Farm"" and ""Big Bottom"" are sublime. If ""Spinal Tap"" ever goes on tour again, make sure you beg, borrow or steal a ticket. And, oh yes, see this movie!",This Is Spinal Tap
263,cynthialev4,rockumockumentary gold,8,10 April 2007,"This Is Spinal Tap has so many components that draw from distinctly different talents, it's a wonder that it bonds so brilliantly. Remember this is from 1984. The documentary style was hardly a vehicle for entertainment, and people were not used to watching hours of E! True Hollywood Stories, or Making the Band. It must have been a huge risk to assume people would go along with the premise in the first place, then get the satire and irony that make it so funny. Humor changes a lot over the years, but this is a movie that it not going away anytime soon. Lastly, the musical numbers are actually very catchy and clever. This might have been the make or break aspect of the film, because it would be much harder to stay interested in the movie if the band played awful or really boring music.

An insiders movie -- like ""The Player"" by Robert Altman -- if you don't like, er, ""get"", the music industry (especially its vapid nature of heavy metal in the 1980's) then I STILL think this is funny for all. Anyone always finds at least ONE thing/sketch in this film funny. And to think this -- with NO SCRIPT! The actors were and are the writers. That's what makes this film. Their sheer ability to improv with great cliché & faux, yes, British accents and all. Blimey! -- spot-on mate! Guest as Nigel Tufnel and Mike McKean and Harry Shearer's chemistry is amazing and graceful to watch. In this authors opinion: Spinal Tap is the American version of Monty Python -- sorta.

272,mgnoble,The Greatest Comedy of ALL TIME!,9,9 June 2000,"This movie separates those with a sharp sense of humor from the merely sentient.  No one thinks this movie is ""average"" or ""okay.""  You either ""get it"" or you don't; those who don't look at those who do with a puzzled look in their eyes, as though they know they're missing something but aren't sure what.  Sometimes they are even bitter.  I've noticed that many of the comments here say that music people are the ones who always love this movie, and maybe they do get a bit of a head start on the situational comedy; but in the long run, it's those who appreciate sarcasm and satire, along with a good ""turn of the phrase"" that really appreciate this film.  Is this slapstick humor laced with subtlety or subtle comedy laced with slapstick? The beauty is, it's really hard to tell. ""This Is Spinal Tap"" is one of those few films whose phraseology has made its way into the English language.  ""But these go to eleven"" and ""There's a fine line between clever and stupid"" may not yet be as famous as ""Frankly, Scarlett, I don't give a damn"" or ""Life is like a box of chocolates,"" but they are gaining fast.  Watch as one Taphead utters a ""Tapism"" in the presence of another:  ""The answer is none--none more black."" Boom!--immediate kinship, for both instantly know that they are part of the limited fraternity that revels in enjoyment of this movie.  The opposite of this is when an unhappy new viewer, being forced to watch the film by his or her Taphead friend, turns to him three-quarters through the movie and says, ""I can't believe this is a real band."" All in all, ""This Is Spinal Tap"" comes highly recommended--an easy 10 out of 10--and is easily Reiner's best effort, even including ""Stand By Me.""Long live Tap!",This Is Spinal Tap
273,jeffnc,A classic of the genre,9,9 March 2000,"I am giving this a very high rating - 9.  This should be taken in the context of the type of movie it is.  It certainly does not compare to ambitious, classic movies of all time.  However, if you like the subject matter, I think you will not find a better movie of this style.  It is a ""rockumentary"", somewhat in the style of VH1's ""Behind the Music"", but without the spoken commentary.  It really captures the feel of a real documentary, turned comedy.  One reason it is so well done is that a whole album of original music was created just for this movie, which makes the band ""virtually"" real, if you get my drift.  And the music is great - that is, it's not that good.  It certainly is bombastic though, and could very easily have actually been an album from that time period.  If you are a rock fan, and especially if you grew up in the 60s/70s, this is a must see, with several classic quips that all party-goers must be familiar with, such as ""this one goes to 11.""",This Is Spinal Tap

276,movesgrooves,I give this movie an 11/11,10,8 August 2010,"I am shocked to learn that people older than me have not seen this movie, which came out before I was even born. ""This Is Spinal Tap"" is great on so many levels. For one, it deserves props for popularizing the genre of ""mockumentaries"" (or ""mock"" documentaries). Secondly, it is hands down the best satire on rock-'n'-roll AND the best mockumentary. Sure, there have been other decent mockumentaries and rock comedies; however, the film's brilliance remains unparalleled. Moreover, it is not nasty in its indictment of rock bands. As opposed to completely scorning its topic, it simply points out the foibles of rock-'n'-roll, such as how drumming can be a deadly job.The film, furthermore, is full of unforgettable moments as well as brilliant performances by members of the fictional band Spinal Tap--- Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer. As with the later Guest-penned mockumentaries (which I also love), much of the film is improvised. However, even the premeditated material is golden. Examples are the band's catchy songs that sound eerily authentic or smaller details such as critical reviews of Spinal Tap albums.This film may be over a quarter of a century old, yet it will be relevant for years to come. Now that the 1980s are long gone, we can see the ridiculousness of all those hair bands. The fact that the creators of ""This Is Spinal Tap"" had this insight at that time makes the film all the more ingenuous.",This Is Spinal Tap

There are great cameos by a phenominal range of people, like Billy Crystal and Fran Drescher.

283,itsonelouder,One of the best comedy films (about ANYTHING) ever!,10,19 January 2001,"INTRODUCTION:  In 1982, an aging (40ish) English band is embarking on its 1st American tour in 6 years to promote a new album, ""Smell the Glove,"" which is not quite ready for distribution due to dispute over its lurid, sexist cover art.  Spinal Tap has had its commercial and popularity ups-and-downs since the mid 1960s.  Although known as one of England's loudest heavy-metal bands, their catalogue actually includes a wide range of musical styles.  The 3 primary musicians include guitarist and lead vocalist David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean), lead guitarist and auxillary vocalist Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest), and bass guitarist and background vocalist Derek Smalls (Harry Shearer).David is a somewhat pompous, pseudo-intellectual who likes ruffles, velvet and satin stage attire and has a rather pushy New-Age girlfriend (Jeanine exerts a major cosmic influence on David's life and creates a wedge between him and childhood friend Nigel).  Nigel is a confused chain-smoking, gum-chewing, accomplished guitarist with strong juvenile tendencies, a love of kilts, and a knack for inane invention.  Derek prefers a studs-and-leather stage presence but is perhaps the most intelligent of the lot and assumes the role of realist and peacemaker.Filmmaker and fan Martin DiBergi (Rob Reiner) accompanies them on this tour to create a documentary of the experience, but Spinal Tap will later accuse Marty of making a ""hatchet job"" by portraying them in an unfavorable and unflattering light.  Marty's film does tend to focus on the historic failings of the band, their apparent waning popularity, and the few(?) times on tour when they couldn't find the stage; had cancellations, production failures, embarrassments, and lapses in competence; bickered amongst themselves; acted like prima donnas; sported their cold sores; and couldn't meaningfully or coherently answer his interview questions.The film is almost entirely improvised from a skeletal plan.  The comedy is subtly and richly layered with humorous but realistic character portrayals/development, malapropisms, double entendres, and numerous sight gags.  No laugh track needed or wanted here! These guys are not only brilliant improvisors, but they are also fine musicians capable of performing a serious-but-quirky, full-length concert (1993 ""Return of Spinal Tap"" concert/comedy video).  They really have written and performed all the wonderful lyrics and arrangements by themselves.  Classics like ""Big Bottom"" and ""Sex Farm.""REVIEWER CONTEXT:  48-year-old female (a scientist and not in the entertainment or music business) who saw the movie for the first time (!) in October 2000 and who loves rock-and-roll (particularly the 1960s and 1970s ""British Invasion"" bands) but is not attuned to raucous ""heavy metal"" sounds or to outrageously gross personas.  Comedy preferences include the Monty Python features, the Pink Panther series, A Fish Called Wanda, The Birdcage, Best in Show, etc.  But, for me, THIS goes to Number 1 (for now anyway).Yes, it grows on you like an untreated fungus.  What I knew in advance of 1st viewing was just that it was supposed to be a funny satire of a ""heavy metal"" band done by actors.  Note that you probably will need several viewings (without interruption) to fully appreciate the humor and to become hooked, but you will love it more and get more out of it with each subsequent viewing.THE PRODUCT(S):  The new VHS tape adds 10 minutes of out-take footage, including the ""Bitch School"" music video.  The new DVD includes an audio overlay for the film itself (ad-libbed, in-character commentary (""defense"") by the 3 principle musicians), about 70 minutes of out-take footage (presented sequentially like the film), a DiBergi update, 4 music videos (excluding Bitch School), other promotional clips, film trailers, advertisements and interviews.  It caused me to buy a DVD player.There is also a 1993 VHS ""Return of Spinal Tap,"" which is a real London sell-out concert from July, 1992, interspersed (approximately every 3 songs) with comedy inserts and interviews; a 4.5 hour bootleg tape of the original movie; 2 real CDs (1984 soundtrack and 1992's Break Like the Wind); a recent book (Spinal Tap Companion by Karl French) with transcripts, lyrics, and other delights; and older materials (laserdiscs, CDRoms, DVDs, VHS) that are out-of-print.",This Is Spinal Tap

That's what makes it amazing is that it's so real all the jokes are spectacular.Christopher Guest, a co-writer and star in this film, also wrote and directed A Mighty Wind and Best in Show... two other fantastic films.I love everyone in this film. Especially Harry Shearer. He's awesome in this movie, awesome in the Simpsons, and awesome on mydamnchannel.com",This Is Spinal Tap
289,mbbxkjel,praise indeed,10,29 January 2003,"this is the greatest film ever. if you have any interest in music, watch this film. if you have any interest in comedy, watch this film.if you have any interest in documentaries, watch this film. if you have any interest in people, watch this film. if you have any interest in life, watch this film!",This Is Spinal Tap
290,bmills313,This film goes to 11,10,5 June 2003,"This is Spinal Tap could be the perfect dry comedy. I love dry, satirical comedies and Tap fits the bill with it's perfect execution and believability. From the first 30 seconds of the movie, I knew it was going to be funny. ""David St Hubbins: Lead Guitar.......Nigel Tufnel: Lead Guitar.""  Make no mistake: this film is not for everyone.  The humor is dry and rather satirical, but there is an element of reality to this that you cannot deny. A British rock band with a mediocre fan following at best that inneptly makes its way through the world not knowing their downfalls and smiling stupidly as their entire world collapses around them. Perfect. The whole time you're watching this film you think to yourself, ""do these guys hear what they are saying?! Do they really believe this?! Are they for real!?""Christopher Guest selected the perfect actors for each of the roles and the chemistry (or perfect conflict among the band members) is sublime. Harry Schearer as bassist Derek Smalls has less screen time than I would have liked, but he plays the guy stuck in the middle between Guest (Nigel Tufnel) and McKean (David St. Hubbins) perfectly. The supporting cast is awesome. Rob Reiner, Billy Crystal, Fran Drescher, Angelica Houston, Bruno Kirby, Ed Begley Jr., Paul Shaffer of David Letterman fame and Fred Williard make up the bulk of the supporting cast. You don't assemble a cast like that, each with small roles in the film, without there being an incredible respect and admiration for the project and the man in charge: Christopher Guest.The format of the film as a documentary is very believable. Camera shots really do seem like it's a documentary instead of a feature film. Rob Reiner as the director of the documentary is wonderful. His questioning of the band and their slow-to-respond remarks give you the feeling that this is all spontaneous and not scripted whatsoever. In fact, I've heard from several sources that the majority of the film is ad-libbed or at least the interaction between the band members is all ""wingin' it.""  There's not much of a plotline, but it's supposed to be a documentary so it stays true to form.  However, the roller-coaster ups and downs of the band produce some truly entertaining comedy. In a strange sort of way, you feel for the band members as you laugh at their exploits because you know they'll be the last ones to laugh at themselves.If you have not seen Tap and are a fan of comedies or music, you owe it to yourself to check this one out. If you can get a copy of the DVD to watch, even better. The DVD has TONS of extra features including dozens of deleted scenes that unfortunately had to be cut; these scenes are just as good as the actual film. But, the best feature is the director commentary which places Guest, McKean and Shearer in character commenting on the film. My friend said it best: it's like a whole new movie! The dialogue can range from being directly related to the scene showing at the time to some tangent that lasts 5 minutes about something that has nothing to do with the scene, or even the movie, at all.In short, you don't want this film to end. Spinal Tap is a masterpiece that cannot be recreated, even though Best in Show does a heck of a job trying. Christopher Guest really shows his love of film and music here and that feeling stays with you from the opening credits to the final scene. This is one of my all time favorite movies and I cannot say enough about how well thought out Spinal Tap was and what a wonderfully produced film Christoper Guest created.",This Is Spinal Tap
291,DudeFunkMan,The Majesty of Rock.,10,25 October 2003,"""This is Spinal Tap!"" is simply  more than a film as any owner of the special edition DVD will tell you. The concept and whole project is frankly marvellous, whether it is the ""Heavy Metal Memories"" spoof boxset advert or the apeing of the 1965 ish Beatles in their ""Listen to the Flower People"" press conference.The humour works on many levels in this film, and yet it all derives from the fact that the band are a bunch of ""washed up, brain dead, 4 chord rockers"". Who can forget the Puppet Show getting top billing? Or the fact that the Tap thought having a bigger dressing room than the puppets was some kind of victory?""This is Spinal Tap"" COULD be a documentary, if all the rock anecdotes are to believed, and so, the guilty pleasure of seeing a bunch of 40 somethings spewing garbage, self important philosophy whilst carrying on like the aristocracy of rock is something the people who read or seen interviews of rock bands can relate to.The music certainly doesn't let down the jokes with some great performances of songs that, in some cases, surpasses the genres it  mocks or imitates.The true indication of Spinal Tap's greatness is not what they took and pariodied from Rock, but what Rock took from them, Amps that go past ten and Metallica's ""black album"" immediately come to mind.Funniest film ever? Maybe, Maybe Not. Best Concept ever? Quite Possibly",This Is Spinal Tap
292,judy-310-903497,I'd give it an 11 if I could,10,6 March 2012,"There aren't many films I rate so highly. Spinal Tap is as close to perfect as you can get for a film of it's kind. Even it's imperfections are perfect.Christopher Guest and Co. have an uncanny talent for doing absolutely spot on parody and satire without getting mean-spirited. In fact there are moments that are sweet without being syrupy. And there are more ""classic moments"" in this movie than I have fingers and toes to count them on.If you love rock and fool, funny movies, satire, the golden days of pompous over-the-top rock shows, the thin line between stupid and clever, you'll love Spinal Tap.But why are you reading this? Watch the movie!You're still reading, get the movie and watch it.Seriously watch the movie.Don't make me turn around, watch the movie!",This Is Spinal Tap
293,stevefettke,The Star rating is broken.,10,18 September 2020,I want to be able to rate this film at the top of the scale. Right across the board. 11. 11. 11. But the stars only go to ten. This movie goes to 11.,This Is Spinal Tap
294,markwalters1,A great spoof on rock bands that hits every note.,10,28 December 2005,"This movie is so good and realistic in it's approach, it has left some real rock 'n' roll personalities a little uncomfortable after watching it. To me this is what a great film does. It gets under your skin if you are part of that world, and to the rest of us it is a very well done satire with a classic soundtrack. The performances are excellent by the whole cast, including some cameos which I won't mention. Rob Reiner has crafted what can be viewed as a black comedy depending on your point of view, with hilarious sight gags and dialog. Any fan of rock music for any music for that matter will love this even if it does have a lot of sad truth to it.",This Is Spinal Tap
295,andman8,I wish I could give it an eleven!,10,22 March 2006,"So dry, so funny, but not so so. I have a new appreciation for the color black and I've learned you really can't dust for vomit. On the whole, this film is Heavy Duty. Even though most of the funny stuff is at the beginning the fact that the band is so vain throughout the entire film is comic genius in itself. ""I said Spinal Tap and puppet show"" One doesn't have to do stand up or Jerry Lewis physical comedy crap to be funny. One look at dwarfs dancing around an 18 inch tall Stonehenge proves this. The three main characters balance themselves wonderfully. One is like fire the other like ice and the middle like Luke warm water. I've got to go now, I think i'll open up a chapeau shop.",This Is Spinal Tap

297,dcheinrich,Making a big thing of it would have been a good idea!,9,30 March 2001,Anybody who does not find this film funny is clearly a loser. This rockumentary is hilarious in everything that it does whether it is the classic lines or the band getting lost on the way to the stage.If you did not find this film funny or thought it was crap you obviously missed the subtle humour so you must watch it again!!! As this rating goes to eleven.,This Is Spinal Tap
298,SpinalTapper,Funniest film of all time!,10,20 May 2001,"This has to be the funniest film of all time. Spinal Tap, a mock ""rockumentary"" has to be the most laugh-out-loud film ever and the most hilarious look at the music industry itself! Buy the Special Edition DVD now!",This Is Spinal Tap
299,alan-wright,Margaux comes to mind,9,7 September 2006,"The nuances of this classic seem wasted on a first-time watcher, though, over time, one appreciates that the hair-brained idiocy of the group is in fact a subtly refined aspect of rock- star behaviour. Each detail is conceived so as to replicate the puerility of stardom in the early 80s, and indeed it is a timeless critique of all those who take themselves too seriously. The beauty of the narrative is that it would work as well as a series of sketches as it does as a film. Such is its continuity that we are deeply aware of the downfall of this band, as much as we are of each instance of their estuary simplicity. The ease with which Hubbins distances his most implacable friend in the penultimate stages of the film is indicative of his deep seated vulnerability, which he so transparently tries to hide. Perhaps this is the whole conceit of Spinal Tap. Buffoons are portrayed, yet they are at least sensitive and unwitting ones with whom we can sympathise. Like a Margaux, with each viewing we glean yet more insight into the complexities that underlie their outward aspect. Though to be sure, like a fine wine we must not get too carried away with the esoteric balderdash that pseudos are sure to attribute to it. Nor should we be tempted to overrate it.",This Is Spinal Tap

301,soun,A Rockumentary About a Hardworking Band on the Road!,10,27 October 2001,"A Master Piece That Will Live For Generations!!!A movie FULL of BIGTIME actors and actresses doing improv on a low-budget type film.  The film developing a cult following that would generate a sequel, music videos, soundtracks, a business (Spinal Tap Goods and Services INC.) and a anniversary show has been getting more popular as time goes on. As other types of music comes out (ie. the new boy band craze) It makes that much more sence!  It's funny to see all the joys and pains of a band... This movie covers it in a light-hearted manner...This movie is DARN funny, and is a must see on many levels...  The 'complete' movie is 93 minutes long and is available on VHS (The one I have has Bitch School (1984)- A video at the start of the movie that was banned from MTV in the 90's)  I also have the DVD (The Criterion Collection) which has the full footage (4 hour long movie that had to be cut down to the 93 minutes), commentaries, trailers, demo reel, promo shots, and music videos.",This Is Spinal Tap
302,vixeez,"My thought on ""This is Spinal Tap""",10,5 March 2007,"I was a young girl when this movie came out. Perhaps 20 or so. My older brother and I went to see it at the movies. I found it to be hilarious. There is so much humor there. It takes a certain kind of person to appreciate this movie. I, personally, thought it was brilliant. I loved the stone henge, the malfunctioning pods, and the basic ineptness of all involved. It probably rings more true than most people realize. Going to see this movie with my brother is one of the fondest memories I have of the two of us spending time together. We laughed through the whole movie. I recently met a very famous rock star here on Maui, and I would have loved to pick his brain. I am to polite for all that however. At any rate, I would love to hear comments about this extraordinary movie for anyone who wishes to dish about it.",This Is Spinal Tap

304,garthwb,Sheer Brilliance And Utter Stupidity!,10,27 August 2015,"This film is almost the very definition of a cult comedy classic. It is an outrageously funny mixture of sheer brilliance - on the part of the film-makers - and utter stupidity (the uproarious situational gags that the ""band"" find themselves in and their typically ridiculous quips and one-liners, wittily ad-libbed by the actors). In fact, it's just like the hard rock & heavy metal genres themselves, along with many of the musicians who play and tour the music - brilliant and boneheaded at the same time - which is why I love them! If you're a fan of improvisational comedy, mockumentaries, hard rock/ metal, campy silliness or you just want to watch a classic, tongue-in-cheek comedy, do yourself a favour - you'll be quoting it ad infinitum thereafter, with friends who are also ""in the know""... Most people probably don't realize that the rating on IMDb for this film goes ""up to 11""! Watch the film to find out why... A superbly entertaining, weirdly accurate and uniquely mirthful portrayal of ""life on the road"" for a bunch of ageing rockers. Get it now!",This Is Spinal Tap

307,adrienn,"""It goes to 11""",7,4 January 2006,"""This is Spinal Tap"" by Rob Reiner is a rather funny and satyric glimpse at the life of a famous rock n'roll band. This documentary - ""rockumentary"" as Martin Di Bergi (a.k.a ) states in the opening sequence actually was a mock, since the band Spinal Tap never existed, and was indeed created for the purpose of this movie, which eventually became such a success that people really got to believe they existed, leading the ""band"" to record a ""real"" sequel to the movie's soundtrack, known as the ""Break like the Wind"" album.The comical strength of the movie lies both in such absurd moments as the backstage food scene, the amp that goes to 11 or the 18 inches Stonehenge recreation that stands on stage, ""in danger of being crushed by a dwarf"", as well as memorable quotes and song lyrics. Even if the movie's ""ultimate rock star movie"" status may imply you need a solid rock n'roll culture to enjoy it, I guess fans of any kind of music can actually have fun watching it. Surely not an Oscar winner, but a big nice piece of fun.",This Is Spinal Tap

309,dbr4good,Heard it was great but then I saw it,3,30 April 2006,"For years I'd been hearing about the genius of ""This Is Spinal Tap"" and the incredible moment when the amplifier's knob is brought up. Finally the day came when I saw the movie. And I cannot tell you how disappointed I was. But I'll try...Sophomoric, predictable, and generally irritating were my lasting impressions. But I must say in all fairness that I had already seen ""Best in Show"" and ""A Mighty Wind"". After seeing those, TIST seemed to be nothing more that a rehash of those movies. But of course TIST was the one that first pioneered this humor - or at least the most successful of this type (also see ""Kentucky Fried Movie"" for yet another similar experience. If you could watch ""A Mighty Wind"" and ""Best in Show"" over and over again as my kids can, then I'd guess you would be a big fan of TIST. I, however, am not.",This Is Spinal Tap

There's every rock cliché in here and then some. I think the writers were freakin geniuses. My favorite part is when Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest) is showing off his versatility by playing the piano, and when Marty says that's really pretty, what do you call it, Nigel replies, ""Lick my love pump."" Harry Shearer is CLASSIC as Derek Smalls. I really enjoy all the cameos of famous people in here as well. I've downloaded some of the songs. It's amazing how the writers actually wrote some heavy metal songs that are better than a lot of crap they play on the radio. These guys are one of the reasons I learned how to play guitar--I learned that music can be loud and fun, too. TAP ROCKS!",This Is Spinal Tap

He worked on the castle used in the movie. (I guess that can be a 'spoiler'). During one of the 'sets'... Rob called out 'Quiet on the set!' and they proceeded to 'role film'. About ten minutes into the filming... my grandpa turned on his table saw! Rob flew off the handle and started screaming and cussing about the 'noise'. My grandpa came down and they had a heated discussion face-to-face! After a short squabble, Spinal Tap Productions made a check for $1500.00 to 'use NO power tools for three days!'. At the end, we were invited to have dinner with the whole cast and crew of ""This is Spinal Tap""! I also helped find 'props' for the film. A summer I will NEVER forget!!!!",This Is Spinal Tap

313,aalzi,Eleven points!,10,20 February 2020,"Entertaining and funny. It is so well done that I actually thought it's a real documentary. My disappointment was enormous when I later found out that the rockumentary is a made fictional movie, and that the band members are actors.
The cinematography is top noch, made in authentic small budget camcorder style, and hilarious sudden misfortunes and other happenings do look like unplanned events.
All above mentioned makes ""This is Spinal Tap"" a funny movie.
I was thinking about the first time I saw this movie, and when I later started my own band. So much similarities and actual problems of a small starting musical group are present in this great movie. I bet I'm not the only one who would like to see a sequel to Spinal Tap, or some kind of ""The lost tapes of Spinal Tap"". So magical and entertaining movie is this.",This Is Spinal Tap

319,axel_081,Greatest movie of all time,10,7 March 2006,"Spinal Tap would get a 11 out of 10, but I just can't do that.The movie is about 5 members of the band ""Spinal Tap"", which, unlike what most people think, is not real. They are very funny. There has been about 32 different drummers, all of them dying in a very strange way (gardening accident, at least 2 spontanously combusting). The story mainly focuses on the lead guitarist (why there is 2,I don't know), Nigel and David, and the bassist Derek. They were huge at there prime, but now they are getting booed AFTER they preform following a puppet show.This movie has many great quotes, check out that section. I can't go a day without quoting this movie. Everyone i know who has seen this movie can't either. It is just so funny.The music they preform is just hilarious. They sing about a lady with a large butt, flower people, and stonehedge (funny scene.) I would recommend this movie to everyone with a few exceptions. The language at some parts is pretty rough, and the scenes can be adult, so young children look away. Other than that, everyone will love this movie.Rock on, RYAN",This Is Spinal Tap

It is often less comedy and more of a true reflection of the ""adolescent fantasy world"" where rock stars exist. The dialog is mostly unrehearsed and comes across very true to life. The DVD contains an unbelievable amount of cut scenes. A fun feature is the DVD commentary, performed ""in-character"" by the three original band members.One of the funniest movies of all time. This was the original Mockumentary that is so common today. One the neatest things is the number of cameos. Fran Drescher, Billy Crystal, Howard Hesseman, Paul Shaffer and Bruno Kirby are easy to recognize.
