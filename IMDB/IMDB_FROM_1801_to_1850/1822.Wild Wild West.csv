0,TheLittleSongbird,"Great to look at with inventive gizmos, but everything else didn't work",2,16 January 2010,"I just want to say I really wanted to like this movie, but I have to agree this is not like the wonderful series it took its inspiration from. But while it looks great- some of the scenery is fantastic- and there are some inventive gizmos especially the magnetic collars that attract metal blades, it just didn't work for me. So what drew me into seeing the film in the first place. Obviously because I wanted to see if it was any good compared to the series, but also the cast. People, this is a great cast, but the poor writing and surprisingly unfocused direction simply wastes them. Will Smith is like marmite you love him or hate him, for me it is dependent on the film, but I cannot deny he has winning charisma. Sadly that didn't come through, Smith looked uncomfortable here. Same with Kevin Kline, usually good at delivering fun and witty lines, but because the writing was so poor he seemed stuck. The worst case though was Kenneth Branagh as Dr Loveless, this man is simply brilliant in Shakespeare and is a good director in general, but here he shamelessly overacts and I also disliked the treatment this film gave of Loveless. We know that Barry Sonnenfeld can direct comedy, the two Addams Family movies are proof of that, but here his direction is unfocused. The special effects are overblown to say the least, plus the plot is really predictable. The biggest problem though was the writing, even though I am not a scriptwriter or do nothing in the film industry I could tell how smutty the dialogue was, the one-liners particularly below average. And the climax with the mechanical spider was badly drawn out, not helped by the poor design of the spider itself. Not even the music by the brilliant Elmer Bernstein could save this film, there were times when the music felt rather overpowering and that is extremely rare with Bernstein. All in all, tries hard with a couple of redemptions, but it didn't work. 2/10 Bethany Cox",Wild Wild West
1,Leofwine_draca,Worst Hollywood blockbuster of all time,1,16 May 2016,"WILD WILD WEST truly is a stinker of a film. Words cannot adequately express just how inane and endlessly trite this stupid, effects-filled movie is; ostensibly it's the big screen adaptation of a '60s cult TV show, but in reality it brings out the very worst of the Hollywood blockbuster sensibility.The main problem with this film is that it goes for the action comedy template, particularly heavy on the buddy buddy humour. Will Smith was riding high after MEN IN BLACK, but he's really bad here, and I mean really bad. As for Kevin Kline, you can barely believe that this was the same guy from A FISH CALLED WANDA; you actually feel sorry for him. The humour is all of the toilet variety, with a particular focus on oddly misogynistic cross-dressing jokes which quickly become old and rather disgusting. It's one of the unfunniest so-called comedies ever to make it to the screen.Kenneth Branagh gives the worst performance of his career as the hammy disabled villain, and much of the extensive budget was given over to a huge CGI mechnical spider which hasn't aged very well at all. As for the actresses, including Bai Ling and Salma Hayek, they're literally treated as pieces of meat. Barry Sonnenfeld has directed some junk in his time but even he must be ashamed of this one. It's hard to believe that between them the writers of this thing were responsible for the likes of PREDATOR, TREMORS, and WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT.Incidentally, WILD WILD WEST holds a special significance for me as the only film I've ever walked out of at the cinema. I believe in staying to watch a film to the end, no matter how bad - after all, you've paid to be there - but this was so appallingly awful that I felt I had no choice but to leave halfway through. Having recently watched the thing again right through to the end, I'm glad I made that choice.",Wild Wild West
2,SnoopyStyle,All the gadgets in the world can't save this movie,5,21 December 2013,"It's post Civil War. Army Captain James West (Will Smith) is on the hunt for rebel General McGrath (Ted Levine). U.S. Marshal Artemus Gordon (Kevin Kline) is looking for missing scientists. It looks like McGrath has been kidnapping the country's greatest scientists to create an unimaginable weapon system. Meanwhile the legless Dr. Arliss Loveless (Kenneth Branagh) builds weapons, and Rita Escobar (Salma Hayek) looks for her scientist father.This starts off badly with Kevin Kline dressed as a woman. He is SO VERY UGLY. It is truly disconcerting to see the old guy picking Kline over Salma Hayek. It is disturbing in so many ways that hurts deeply in my soul.Then there is all the distractions of those CGI wacky inventions of Gordon. It doesn't impress as much as breaks down most of the scenes. It take me out of the scene and reminds me of a Bugs Bunny cartoon. So much of this movie's budget is wasted on unnecessary and distracting effects. The film is better off not spending all that time pointing the camera at every little gadget of Gordon.Kevin Kline and Will Smith could have been a good buddy cop duo. And having Salma Hayek doesn't hurt anything. I think the actors were lined up for a great fun time. But the action never seems to be as much fun as it should be. It's constantly trying to impress us with some wacky CGI.",Wild Wild West
3,lee_eisenberg,I'm assuming that the original series wasn't like this.,1,21 October 2005,"The only reason to watch the god-awful ""Wild Wild West"" is to see Kevin Kline as a neat foil to Will Smith. Otherwise, the whole movie's a mess. The ""plot"" has agents Jim West (Smith) and Artemus Gordon (Kline) trying to stop nefarious Dr. Arliss Loveless (Kenneth Branagh) from dismantling the United States.Yes, this does sound like a potentially great idea, especially given the cast (which also includes Salma Hayek and M. Emmet Walsh). Unfortunately, the whole movie makes you feel like you just got your head banged against a brick wall. There are a few good scenes, but only a few; the rest of the movie is just a rehash of better movies. Relying way too much on special effects, this movie makes one feel great that 1999 remains best known for movies like ""The Blair Witch Project"" and ""American Beauty"".",Wild Wild West
4,jboothmillard,Wild Wild West,4,23 June 2006,"From Razzie winning director Barry Sonnenfeld (Men in Black) this is an alright transfer of a TV programme to film, but how it was really popular is a bit of a concern. Will Smith as Capt. James West is basically trying to stop a plot to destroy the (not very big) United States, they know this because scientists in destructive fields (fire arms, explosives, etc) have been kidnapped. He is accompanied by inventor U.S. Marshal Artemus Gordon (twice Razzie nominated Kevin Kline) to stop the suspected General 'Bloodbath' McGrath (Ted Levine), and then the real villain, Dr. Arliss Loveless (Razzie nominated Kenneth Branagh). Soon enough, the villains kidnap the one person who can surrender the United States, Pres. Ulysses S. Grant (Kline again). Also starring Razzie nominated Salma Hayek as Rita Escobar and M. Emmet Walsh as Coleman. Filled with not hilarious small jokes, weapons and some more modern things, such as a mechanical spider, this is not a bad film, but it is certainly not one to watch very often. It won the Razzies for Worst Picture, Worst Screenplay, Worst Original Song for Smith's title song (why?) and Worst Screen Couple for Smith and Kline. Will Smith was number 51 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Adequate!",Wild Wild West
5,ccthemovieman-1,Smith's Smug Attitude Too Much For Me,4,15 March 2006,"Here's a typical Will Smith movie which means lightweight action, him proclaiming he is Mr. Macho throughout the film, a dumb story.....but an entertaining film in a number of spots and fun to watch ONCE. That about sums up a lot of his films, one or two of which are a little better and a couple are far worse. Overall, this is pretty good....but there is only so much I can take of smug people (can you say, Chevy Chase?).You can thank the special effects team for bailing out Smth's arrogant butt and making this movie fun to watch here and there. There were some very entertaining gadgets in here, especially the robots. The movie makes little sense, has no credibility and is a just a vehicle for mindless entertainment, which is fine at times. There is a place for that, for those who need a break from too-serious films.This also is an excellent vehicle for the DVD format because the visuals are razor-sharp and colorful and the surround sound effective. This is a combination sci-fi/western/comedy rolled into one and is almost a cartoon in nature. The villain, played by Kenneth Branagh, is so ludicrous that he's almost comical. Kevin Kline, as Smith's partner, is a likable guy and Hayek is there for her usual purpose: show off her ample boobs.It's entertaining but I liked the old television show of this much better, the one featuring Robert Conrad and Ross Martin.",Wild Wild West
6,Quinoa1984,Among the worst of the year,3,30 April 2000,"What was Barry Sonnenfeld thinking when he decided to make this?  Well, he though Will Smith would propell him to his second Independence day block-buster.  WRONG.  Not every film can be as good as Men in Black.  This film is just bad.  I don't even reccomend it to kids.  The story is so ridiculous I don't want to even go into it now.  True, the talent in this film is great, but they are undermined by a 80-ft tarantula.  And does Will Smith have to do a song for every damn movie he's in.  I usually like films with Kevin Kline, but Uggh.  D- (not F, I liked the Salma Hayek character).",Wild Wild West
7,wes-connors,Mr. Smith Goes South,2,22 May 2013,"In 1869 Louisiana, an old man is decapitated. After the credits, we are introduced to rapper Will Smith (as James ""Jim"" T. West). Interrupted during a nude bath, Mr. Smith goes to Washington and meets the President of the United States. Smith dresses his body in black western gear, beginning with a hat on his privates. Next introduced is future partner and master-of-disguise Kevin Kline (as Artemus Gordon). Interrupted during a sex sting, Mr. Kline is posing as a prostitute with very realistic cleavage. They are hired to prevent demented Kenneth Branagh (as Doctor Loveless) from assassinating President Ulysses S. Grant...The original 1960s TV series had a great theme song, as did many successful old shows. You had to tune in to hear ""The Wild Wild West"" theme, at least. At the heart of the stories was the friendship between the original West (Robert Conrad) and Gordon (Ross Martin). If you were lucky, the wicked ""Dr. Loveless"" (Michael Dunn) would make an appearance. There is little in this re-make that duplicates the original series. The leading character is completely changed. The rapport between the co-stars is non-existent. You do get race jokes, cleavage (highlighted by Salma Hayek) and special effects (highlighted by a giant spider).** Wild Wild West (6/30/99) Barry Sonnenfeld ~ Will Smith, Kevin Kline, Kenneth Branagh, Salma Hayek",Wild Wild West

9,hitchcockthelegend,Steampunk Blockbusterdom!,5,27 February 2016,"Barry Sonnenfeld's Wild Wild West is a film that I have avoided for over 15 years. I have no frame of reference with the source materials, but even though I'm a big Westerns fan, it wasn't this, or the critical pounding it got on release, that kept me away. It was the original trailers for it, it just looked like a garbled over budgeted mess - which it kinda is. However, that's not to say there isn't fun to be had, because for all its many failings (poor effects, poor script, waste of a strong cast, superficiality), there is some verve and swagger, excitement, Will Smith's likability and some splendid gadgets. Having very low expectations no doubt helped me out, but I would hardly call this a 1/10 type of film. I say chill out with a beer, turn the home cinema speakers up and just roll with it, because thinking about it too deeply could possibly make you angry... 5/10",Wild Wild West
10,poolandrews,"I liked it, tell me why I shouldn't.",6,18 June 2010,"Wild Wild West is set during 1869 & starts as US President Ulysses S. Grant (Kevin Kline) orders US Marshall Artemus Gordon (Kevin Line) & Captain Jim West (Will Smith) to work together & discover who has kidnapped twelve of America's top scientists during the past year. Gordon & West reluctantly agree to work together & find out from General 'Bloodbath' McGrath (Ted Levine) that crazed southern confederate soldier Dr. Arliss Loveless (Kenneth Branagh) has created a giant mechanical Spider which he plans to use to kidnap President Grant & force him to sign power of the entire US over to him. With his army of mechanical weapons Dr. Loveless seems to have the upper hand but the courage & determination of Gordon & West is the President's & US's only hope...Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld & based on The Wild Wild West (1965-1969) TV series which ran for over a hundred episodes it seems that I should hate this big budget Hollywood adaptation, I mean with comments that say it's 'completely worthless', 'utter utter crap' & 'an awful waste of talent' in the IMDb comment section surely Wild Wild West is the worst film ever made that no-one would ever like? Right? Wrong. I liked Wild Wild West, yes that's right I liked it & it has problems but is a fun ride that I found more entertaining I had any right to expect considering Wild Wild West has a really bad reputation. Straight away I liked the playful & often funny script, sure it's absurd with a huge mechanical Spider, a legless villain, flying machines, decapitation traps & a plot to take control of the US but I was entertained & thought it moved along like a rocket with barely a wasted moment as the jokes, visual gags & special effects come thick & fast. The humour is hit & miss I will say that, I thought some of it was very funny like the hilarious speech Will Smith gives to the Louisiana plantation mob while at other times I thought it was embarrassing like Will Smith turning up in a see through Harem outfit to save Kevin Line but what the hell at least it tries & there's just about enough positive here to outweigh the negative. While the film never takes itself seriously & it's good fun there are times when Wild Wild West slips into embarrassing slapstick & some parts are just too goofy like Will Smith bouncing between two trains on a bungee cord, or the revolving billiards table or people randomly emerging from paintings or the silly flying Penny Farthing bike although at other times it's funny like when Will Smith takes on some bad guy's while naked or Will Smith & Kevin Kline trying to outrun two huge spinning blades through a cornfield. The narrative is poor, gaining clues from the burned in image of a decapitated heads eyes, a woman finding out where Loveless is by listening to his female guards talk about how the desert will effect their hair & so on but plot isn't really the strong point of the film.The special CGI computer effects are pretty good, the giant marching mechanical Spider looks great as does the whole film including other machines such as a tank, trains & the Loveless wheelchair which itself grows legs at the end. The production design is great with a period wild west look combined with the whole steam punk technological look with huge pistons, huge metal machines bolted together with huge rivets & the intricacy of the designs are impressive & memorable. There's not much violence here, a few fist fights & a decapitated head. Apparently undergoing expensive re-shoots to add more humour after test audiences didn't know if it was meant to be a comedy or not, maybe that's the reason some of the more silly moments are present. The ending was also re-shot with Will Smith fighting those men in the engine room as originally he only fought & killed those female guards.With a supposed budget of over $150,000,000 Wild Wild West was the most expensive film made in 1999, although shot in oragney desert hues the film looks good with great production values. Will Smith apparently turned down the lead in The Matrix (1999) & is pretty cool here, Kevin Line is a nice contrast while Kenneth Branagh is very theatric as the main villain & his female guards are hot even if they are underused & just sort of stand there.Wild Wild West is a film that many seem to hate, I say to hell with them all because I really liked it. I thought it was funny, exciting, cool & very enjoyable to watch & if some of the goofier moments had been toned down then I think more people would have liked it. Ceratinly nowhere near as bad as many make out.",Wild Wild West
11,zardoz-13,"""Wild Wild West"" Is No Cinch.",1,12 September 2008,"Remember the nifty gadget in ""Men in Black"" that Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith used to erase a person's memory? Some moviegoers who suffer through director Barry Sonnenfeld's big-screen bastardization of the CBS-TV cult classic sci-fi oater ""Wild Wild West"" may wish they could get their hands on that thingamajig. ""Wild Wild West"" qualifies as one of the worst movies ever adapted from a groundbreaking TV show. Indeed, even something as execrable as ""The Avengers"" surpasses this saddle sore sagebrusher. Audiences too young to recall the Robert Conrad & Ross Martin frontier farce will have fewer objections with this frivolous ""Blazing Saddles"" spin on the venerable TV series. Sure, ""Wild Wild West"" captures the essence of the TV show, but Sonnenfeld and his scenarists cannot imitate its artistry. The title credits evoke memories of the paneled inserts that appeared during the cliffhanger moments and Elmer Bernstein's orchestral score replicates some of the punch of Richard Markowitz's original music. Nevertheless, this disastrous, $100-million plus dust raiser ends up as empty-headed as a sun-scorched steer skull in the sand. Inheriting the James West role created by Robert Conrad, Will Smith looks about as out of place as he would look at a KKK rally. Smith supercharged ""Men in Black"" and ""Independence Day,"" but he is thoroughly miscast. Moreover, the short-sighted Sonnenfeld never justifies James West's change of color. Neither Kevin Kline as sidekick Artemus Gordon nor noted Shakespearean thespian Kenneth Branagh as the dastardly Confederate egomaniac Dr. Arliss Loveless redeem this thinly woven tumbleweed tale.The back story that the sextet of scribes drummed up for James West is equally as contrived. Not only do they fail to address the race makeover, but they also overlook the fact that the Northern setting where West's family and friends were massacred was more racist than parts of the Deep South. Finally, couldn't Sonnenfeld have devised a better explanation for West's cultural change? Not that most people on the even the year 2000 in our hopelessly politically correct culture will remember it, but African-Americans found their career choices extremely circumscribed during Reconstruction. Any excuse would have been better than what ""Wild Wild West"" serves up. And the racism here lacks the venomous vibes of ""Blazing Saddles.""Six scenarists received credit for this pastiche of a western. Who wrote what remains a mystery, but they dredged up a story so lame-brained that it resembles skits from a second-rate ""Saturday Night Live"" episode cross-bred with an antiquated Cold War thriller. President Ulysses S. Grant (Kevin Kline in such bad make-up that he passes for a bearded Charles Grodin) orders West and Gordon to learn who is kidnapping the greatest scientific minds of the century. West prefers to work alone, and Artemus feels similarly about him. Another problem with ""Wild Wild West"" is that it acts more like a prequel. Our heroes start out hating each other. West is an Army Captain on the trail of ex-Rebel General 'Blood Bath' McGrath (Ted Levine of ""Heat"") while Gordon is a U.S. Marshal on the same trail. Essentially, West is a shoot-first & ask-questions later kind of hombre, while Gordon is the inventive alternative. He relies on his quirky gimmicks and falls back on gunplay as a last resort. They spend most of the movie competing with each other instead of working together, and this rivalry must have crept into their performances. Smith and Kline kindle little of the chemistry and charisma that made Conrad and Martin so memorable. At the end of the movie, President Grant makes them his first two Secret Service agents. Director Barry Sonnenfeld brings a wry sense of humor to ""Wild Wild West."" While Sonnenfeld's askew brand of comedy complimented ""The Addams Family,"" ""Addams Family Values,"" ""Get Shorty,"" and ""Men in Black,"" the humor wears thin in this western. Casting Kenneth Branagh as a legless villain must have seemed comical on paper, but the special effects buffoonery grows as tiresome and tedious as gibes about handicapped people and blacks. Occasionally, a scene or two nearly works, such as projecting the last image on the retina of a dead scientist. Will Smith's James West sabotages the scene by repeating ad nauseam: ""That is a man's head,"" as if anything remotely human mattered in this ersatz opus. Furthermore, Sonnenfeld wrangles everything from previous summer epics. The Lego-style, 80 foot, mechanical tarantula that storms through Utah's Monument Valley looks as clunky as this movie sounds.Scenarists S.S. Wilson, Brent Maddock, Jeffrey Price, Peter Seaman, and Jim & James Thomas break the cardinal rule of all action flicks. Neither James West nor Artemus Gordon is ever in jeopardy. Sonnenfeld and his joke happy writers erect hoops for our heroes to leap through but they never set fire to those hoops. In other words, the filmmakers make it far too easy for our heroes. The magnetic collar scene is probably the worst offender. Rivaling it is James West's escape from a lynch party, and the final assault on the giant tarantula will have you yawning. West dispatches several henchmen with the aplomb of 007, right down to knocking a blade-wielding villain overboard so he can quip, ""No more Mr. Knife Guy."" At least, in the TV show, Robert Conrad makes the brawls look believable; Conrad foreshadowed Jackie Chan in that the former performed all his own stunts, sometimes at his own peril.""Wild Wild West"" struggles so desperately to be funny that it degenerates into a travesty. The film dabbles in sexual innuendoes that seem extreme for its PG-13 rating. Parents should think twice before exposing their children to these questionable shenanigans. Overblown special effects, sketchy characters, zero chemistry between the leads, gratuitous humor, and unsavory violence ride roughshod over anything remotely memorable in this train wreck of a movie. Aptly enough, Robert Conrad has summed up ""Wild Wild West"" as ""an abortion.""",Wild Wild West
12,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Just completely worthless in every conceivable way,1,1 October 2004,"I tried to keep an open mind when I saw this, I really did. I have never been a fan of Will Smith, but I always hated him more as a rapper than as an actor, so I figured I could afford giving him another chance. Just a little footnote here; I didn't actually pay any money to see this. It was given to me by a friend of mine, who is a huge lover of movies. He simply couldn't stand it, and just immediately took advantage of the chance to get rid of it... not to say that I'm unhappy with that, though... I have enjoyed the few minutes of the movie where Salma Hayek shows skin. Anyway, the movie comes on. OK. The beginning looked decent, and the opening credits are in an interesting style which I've been told is quite reminiscent of the original series which this is a remake of/based on, even going as far as using the same music, or at least something a lot like it. However, from there and until the very end of the film, it slopes continually downward. The plot is a nonsensical mess. The editing is sloppy and lazy. The acting is just barely passable... even Hayek was disappointing in this. The characters are tired stereotypes, each and every one of them. The special effects are laughable. The humor isn't... it's just bad. Not even ""so bad that it's good"" bad, but more like ""so bad that it's gone past good, and gone back to bad"". Yes, I stole that line from Ghost World. The best line in the whole movie... anyway, back to Wild Wild Mess... sorry, West. Wait... West? As in western? This is a western? There's one single scene in which the ""cowboy"" in the film actually fires his gun. That looked semi-cool, but the surrounding film is just... so terribly pedestrian and substandard. The film has, I think, four or five somewhat entertaining scenes, or, rather, parts of scenes. Unfortunately, it's surrounded by so much pointless film. The few decent scenes involve Salma Hayek flashing her buttocks, which is most likely the primary reason for me sitting through (most of) it once. Others include Lai Bing(or is it Bing Lai? Whatever) showing her butt in a thong. Then there are maybe one or two decent fights and that's it. Almost two hours of film, and that's it. This film is honestly not worth sitting through, unless you're incredibly tolerant and have an almost unhealthy amount of patience and spare time. I would recommend you just search the Internet for the butt-shots and forget you ever heard about the movie. You'll save yourself a lot of grief and regret. The film is a prominent example of what you shouldn't do when making a movie, and it's only real purpose is to show to wannabe film-makers just to give them a good idea of what to avoid like the plague, when putting their movie together. I recommend it only to the biggest fans of the actors, as just about anyone else will hate this as much as it appears almost everyone else who've seen it do. 1/10",Wild Wild West
13,view_and_review,Will Wild West,7,14 December 2020,"Although anachronistic and down right silly at times, I liked it. It was funny and entertaining.U.S. Army captain Jim West (Will Smith) and U.S. Marshal Artemus Gordon (Kevin Kline) are both after someone kidnapping scientists. They are thrust together as partners at the behest of the POTUS Ulysses S. Grant (also Kevin Kline). Their investigating puts them on the trail of an ambitious, polysyllabic, spurn confederate named Dr. Arliss Loveless (Kenneth Branagh). Dr. Loveless has a grand scheme to take the United States by force.This was action comedy with a lot of retro gadgetry. Instead of the cutting edge spy tools you'd see in 007 or ""Mission: Impossible"", Gordon and West were using the more rudimentary form of stuff we'd see today.

As someone who never saw the original series, I really don't care whether the film betrays everything it ever stood for or not. I simply say the following: it is clearly set up as a vehicle for Will Smith (at that point riding the crest of his wave); it is handsomely mounted; - it is over the top and, clearly, intentionally so; it is mostly quite amusing; it is full of action and decent effects; the main characters are well drawn and likable.I enjoyed it.",Wild Wild West

Emmet Walsh: Pointless and utterly stupid adventure that boasts nothing more than a budget. The only thing remotely wild about it is that it combines western elements with science fiction. Witless plot regards yet another world domination scheme by a villain whose body is mechanical from the waste down. He is played with extreme madness by Kenneth Branaugh in one of his worst performances. Will Smith plays Jim West who searches for kidnapped scientists. If they are ever found then they will have to live with the fact that they were part of this film. Kevin Kline plays a disguise expert whom West reluctantly companions with. Preposterous and silly plot with predictable mayhem that results in one of the biggest over produced pieces of junk to be released all year. It has interesting gadgets and a giant mechanical spider but it lacks the spirit of Barry Sonnenfeld's superior and similar Men in Black. Smith and Kline have little chemistry and Salma Hayek is ridiculous as a scientist's daughter. It is Branaugh who is the most unfortunate and placed in position of looking the worst as this nitwit villain. Insulting the creators of the original TV show is pretty much all Sonnenfeld accomplishes here. It should be left in a ghost town to be forgotten. Score: 2 / 10",Wild Wild West
16,HotToastyRag,Sometimes it's fun to watch something bad,3,31 May 2020,"There's probably nobody out there who will admit to liking Wild Wild West. It's become a running joke to mention it and roll one's eyes, as if it's the worst movie ever made. As someone who's seen thousands of movies, I can tell you it's not the worst movie ever made. I even went to see it in the theaters. Who wouldn't want to see Will Smith, Kevin Kline, Salma Hayek and Kenneth Branagh? Plus, I'm a sucker for westerns.A must for all good westerns is the theme. If a western doesn't have good music, there's just no hope for it. Elmer Bernstein takes the helm of this one, so at the very least, you'll have something nice to listen to. In a funny throwback to Kevin Kline's previous comedy Dave, he plays another dual role of the President of the United States and someone trying to protect him. This time around, it's President Grant. (Remember, this is based off the 1960s tv series.) Kevin and Will team up to help catch Ted Levine, a murderous bad guy, and as they're taking a train, they meet Kenneth Branagh and Salma Hayek. One of them is the love interest, and one of them is a secret bad guy; I'll let you figure it out.So, this isn't the best, and it isn't the worst. Western spoofs are always a risk to make, which is why they aren't attempted very often. Try a drinking game to help the evening along, and if you find you really don't like it, rent Silverado to restore your faith in the great American genre.",Wild Wild West
17,FlashCallahan,I Just Made That Up........,5,11 April 2017,"When a body is found and the killer is identified as General 'Bloodbath' McGrath, Capt. James West is sent to find him. Thanks to U.S. Marshal Artemus Gordon, who was also on the case, McGrath manages to escape. Discovering that Dr. Arliss Loveless is the real villain behind everything, West and Gordon must work together to track Loveless down.....When the studio made this, they must have thought that the film was a license to print money. After all Sonnenfeld was on a winner after MIB, and Will Smith could do no wrong. This was made at a time when his name alone was big enough to sell tickets.But even though the film is an unmitigated disaster, it's one of those films like Batman & Robin, The Avengers, and Battlefield Earth that demand repeat viewings because just of how audacious the film was in thinking that it had a chance to be one of the biggest films ever.But it's watchable for all the wrong reasons. Would Smith really sign on to a film like this now, because he's basically hurled racial abuse by all and sundry in this film, and at times instead of being 'utterly hilarious', it's downright embarrassing.For instance, the scene where West and Loveless first meet is so full of discriminating put downs, it's surprising that it hasn't been edited for obscene content.Kline is pretty okay as Gordon, but he's a seasoned actor, and he has a look on his face that says 'this will get me back into the big league'. Kevin, you are so much better than this.Hayek is eye candy, and in the film for nothing more than to have the two main characters have something to altercate about.Branagh takes his role for what it is, a pantomime villain, and appears to be having a whale of a time. But the film is incoherent, very confusing at times, and it just appears that the makers just want as many visually stunning set pieces they can in its duration and hope that will cover the ridiculous narrative.And speaking of narrative, there is no explanation as to the fascination of Spiders, but if you read the history of the films production, you'll find out it was just because Barbara Streisand's Ex had a fascination with them.If only he had a fascination with making a decent film...",Wild Wild West
18,Aaron1375,You know what? There is a giant mechanical spider in this movie!,3,27 January 2010,"Yes, it is fairly obvious that the crew behind this film were really proud of their giant robot spider as it was featured in all the trailers and a good portion of this film. In fact the way the movie plays out it looks like the movie's main reason for existence was to feature said spider in a movie, the rest of the film being unimportant to them which is why most of the movie seems like underdeveloped filler to get us to the spider. Which is why the film suffers and is an example of Hollywood not coming up with anything new and instead resorting to remaking an old movie or old television show, in this case a television show I have never really seen any episodes of in my entire life. I will admit that once in a while Hollywood will hit pay dirt with these remakes as it did with ""The Fugitive"", but these hits are few and far between. Usually you end up with a horrible film like say ""The Avengers"", ""The Mod Squad"", or this movie. This film though seemed destined to be bad as I remember that it came out the same time as the Columbine shootings and they did re shoots on the movie to make Gordon against guns thus most likely ruining some of the continuity of the film. It also did not help that Barry Sonnefield directed this film, as he did good with the first ""Men in Black"" movie, but all the other movies of his that I have seen end up like this film. He does not seem to know what audience he is marketing these films too, he puts lots of violence in them seemingly aiming his movies more to adults, while at the same time he puts lots of goop in movies cause kids like goop. Will Smith and Kevin Klein are uninspired and in the case of Klein uninspired in two roles, why not just get another actor is beyond me, I guess they were trying to cut some costs so they could pour more money into that spider. Both actors seem to be just there to get a paycheck, but once again this could be partly do to the re shoots because after being essentially done with the film they are called back to shoot additional scenes. The villain, Loveless was horrible as were most of the twists and turns in this movie that is set in the old west, but boasts machines that did not appear in that era, which could have been good if done more correctly instead it seems like precious little time was spent on the script and more time was spent once again on the spider which looked okay, but nothing special. At least they did not try to hide what it looked like, like the makers of the bad ""Godzilla"" movie tried to do. So in the end this film is rather bad, I did sort of like the collars with the saws, but even that scene ended stupidly as somehow in the middle of a cornfield our heroes fall into a chasm filled with goop and that sadly is what most of this movie is...goop and a giant spider.",Wild Wild West
19,Wuchakk,"It's a blockbuster parody, what do ya expect?",7,17 June 2014,"""Wild Wild West"" has to be one of the most notorious films ever made. Released in 1999, it's a blockbuster parody of the late-60's TV series with Will Smith in the starring role, which should tip everyone off that the film's not meant to be taken seriously (not that the TV series could be taken all that seriously either, just more serious than this movie).Kevin Kline plays James West's reluctant partner and he's a wiz with gizmos. Many complain about the ""lack of chemistry"" of the two stars, but I think it's a bunch of Barbra Streisand (BS). What these people don't get is that these characters are NOT SUPPOSED to like each other. As far as I'm concerned, Smith & Kline make an entertaining team and are perfectly suitable for this movie.Kenneth Branagh and Ted Levine are also on hand as villains, but it's sassy, petite Salma Hayek who wins the prize for best supporting actor. This is only the second film I've seen her in and she just shines. Salma appears in some attractive outfits, including one with white fishnet stockings, and she's just a beauty to behold.BOTTOM LINE: I don't get what the whiners are complaining about with this movie, unless they were uber-fans of the TV series and were expecting a serious film adaption. ""Wild Wild West"" is an energetic goofy blockbuster spoof with all the requisite trappings, like 1999's ""The Mummy"" and 2004's ""Van Helsing."" I call these types of films ""big dumb fun"" movies because they're not meant to be taken too seriously; they're ""Summer blockbusters"" and solely exist to entertain & amuse the viewer. Knowing this will help you appreciate ""Wild Wild West."" So turn off your brain and enjoy the ride.The film runs 106 minutes and was shot in California, New Mexico, Utah, Arizona and Idaho.GRADE: B",Wild Wild West
20,namashi_1,Half-Baked!,5,14 April 2011,"'Wild Wild West', directed by Barry Sonnenfeld, is a Half-Baked action-comedy, that deserved a better deal. A critical and commercial disappointment, this film is more gloss, than substance.'Wild Wild West' is a mega-budgeted action-comedy, where, Two of the best hired guns in the West (Smith and Kline) must save President Grant (Kline, again) from the clutches of a 19th century inventor-villain (Kenneth Branagh).The writing is not up-to the mark. It appeals in some portions, but at places, it fails to hold you. Direction by Barry Sonnenfeld is just about okay. Cinematography is good. Editing is alright.

21,Smells_Like_Cheese,Strange cast,3,1 February 2008,"A little over a month ago, I saw Wild Wild West at Target for $4.50, I heard horrible things about the film, but I figured, it's the rental price, sometimes these movies are not as bad as most say. So I went ahead and bought it, my mistake, I watched it tonite and wasn't really impressed. I mean, while it's a little better than what most would say, it does fall flat with too many fancy effects and Will Smith almost has a love affair with himself in this film. Now Will Smith is one of those rare actors that you can tell on screen as well as off that he has a huge ego, but everyone still loves him because he has a charm and such a presence on screen, he's easy to forgive. However, even though I am not a fan of The Matrix, he turned down The Matrix for this?! What the heck was he thinking? This movie was just very average and held nothing special.Jim West is a war hero who is just loving life as it's loving him right back, he's pretty much won everything he's been handed. Artemus Gordon is a master of disguise and a genius, so when an evil master mind, Loveless, threatens to take over, President Grant partners Artemus and Jim together who of course at first have no chemistry and have to capture Loveless. When a can can girl comes into play, who wants to save ""her father"", she helps them track down Loveless and they must come up with a clever idea to defeat him.Now, Wild Wild West isn't a bad film, it's just made a little strange. Like the cast, Will Smith may be charming, but this movie, he comes off more of a jerk than a smooth cowboy. Selma Hayek, beautiful girl, strange role to take on, the accent was a little distracting I'd say, not to mention I wasn't really impressed with the ""acting qualities"" she has. Now, for a family film, this isn't a bad idea, it's cute in some moments and funny in others, but for a film on entertainment that you're just looking for a good time? I wouldn't really recommend it.3/10",Wild Wild West

We were all fooled and I was part of that fool's parade, playfully called: Will Smith Can Do No Wrong During the Fourth of July.Following the fantastic Independence Day, came the very fun Men in Black. Two years later, WWW, or Wild Wild West premiered. Granted, it sometimes can take three years to nail a great action/comedy/adventure. But, come on, guys, you had plenty of time to get a better Will Smith vehicle than this piece of horse's manure.I remember seeing this on opening weekend in 1999. For the first part of it, I remember kinda liking it, but hoping the great talents behind and in front of the screen would make this a grand western – probably my least favorite genre.Nope, the movie got progressively worse and worse, more and more preposterous and ended with the most WTF climax that was an absolute chore to get through so we could go home. Leading up to the laugh-out-loud finale, were a ton of silly scenes poorly edited together without the sense of logic, humor, grace or entertainment.I vowed, easily, that is, not to ever see this movie again. Thankfully, this movie did fall off my radar and was easily forgotten until fifteen years later. It was then that I discovered the How Did This Get Made podcast. It was/is my mission to watch/re-watch all movies on their show list and then list to their podcasts where they spend about an hour ridiculing, often very hilariously, movies. Sadly, this movie was on that list.Fine, I'll get through it one more time. And with every viewing I have of a movie, I give it a chance. Meaning, here, I went in with an open mind and thought, maybe I was wrong before. It was a decade and a half ago, after all.Again, nope. This movie was actually worse than I remembered it. My only advice is to listen to the How Did This Get Made podcast. Don't even bother watching (or re-watching) this waste of time. The podcast is hilarious and gives much more depth to the making of and behind the scenes I didn't know about which far exceeds any joy you'd get from this turkey.Andthe podcast's guest star isKevin Smith. He was incredible. This movie was not. Skip it.* * * Final thoughts: Mercifully, Kenneth Branagh is great in so many other things. Besides me mentioning him here, forget he was ever part of this. His character was classless, humorless and, ah-hem, had no legs. I forgive Will – he was probably pushed hard to be in this, Selma wasn't huge at the time and Kevin had to take anything he could get a hold of. But, Kenneth was just plain embarrassing to see on screen. Just go see his other fantastic films, instead.",Wild Wild West
25,bensonmum2,Even worse than I remembered,2,4 November 2017,"My one sentence plot summary: Agent Jim West (Will Smith) teams with Agent Artemus Gordon (Kevin Kline) to topple a super-villain named Dr. Arliss Loveless (Kenneth Branagh) who has designs to take over the United States government. I'm not going to bother going into any more detail because Wild Wild West isn't worth the time or effort it would take. Wild Wild West is a bloated, gas-filled, disaster of a film. Unfortunately, I saw this thing in the theater back in 1999. If it's possible, it's even worse now watching it some 18 years later. Absolutely nothing works. The comedy is so far from being funny it's ridiculous. The endless series of jokes about about Jim West being an African American get old and tiring real quick. I get it - he's black - quit beating that dead horse and move on to something else. The jokes about race were so annoying that the unfunny and obvious jokes about Selma Hayek's butt and boobs were actually a welcome change of pace. Believe me when I say that the comedy misses it's mark every time. The rest of the script is equally disastrous and as poorly written as my attempt at writing this little review. When we're not treated to unfunny attempts at comedy, it seems that all the writers could come up with was to have Jim West and Artimus Gordon engage in endless bickering like an old married couple. Or, having the boys are put in dangerous situations that I couldn't be bothered to care about because I hated the characters so much. Finally, all the steam punk trappings end up looking as silly as Kevin Kline dressed as a woman. A steam-powered 80-foot steel spider - whatever! There's just nothing here I found enjoyable.The actors are horrible. Will Smith is miscast. His modern sensibilities do not play well in the role of an 1860s-era government agent. Kevin Kline is no better. And he's not helped by the poorly and ridiculously written character he's given to work with. Branagh is also bad. He's not funny in the slightest - just annoying. And that accent is embarrassing. Selma Hayek is the only cast member I'll say anything positive about and I'm sure part of that is due to her lack of screen time. I'm positive that with a larger role, she would have been terrible also. In the end, I cannot rate Wild Wild West any higher than a 2/10. I'm not going to bother to look, but just how much money was wasted on this piece of monkey excrement?",Wild Wild West

This is the worst Will Smith movie I've ever seen. It's hard to tell whether this is a goofy movie trying to be serious or a serious movie trying to be goofy. It's just too ridiculous to really take either way. This movie features Smith and Kevin Kline fighting some villain who lost the lower half of his body and uses a giant mechanical spider. It's as dumb as it sounds.The jokes are so predictable, particularly with how we know the woman will be real and not Kline in disguise. Of course, it isn't any more pleasant when Will Smith crossdresses. I was expecting some big climax with explosions but it was instead boring.

It's a train wreck from start till finish. I guess in 1999 no one could have predicted that after the success of ""Men in Black"" both Will Smith and Barry Sonnenfeld would fail so hard with their next and even more ambitious (in budget therms) project. ""Wild Wild West"" is all over the map. It's has some nice concept but no content. The plot is so poorly done that you simply don't care what happens on the screen. Humor is so unfunny that you start rolling your eyes. Script, directing as well as everything else here were so poor, so miscalculated that this movie sometimes isn't watchable at all. The one could say that it had a good special effects sequences at the time, but when nothing works, effects don't help.Overall, there isn't any joy in this movie. Even if you are a die hard fan of Will Smith or movies themselves - ""Wild Wild West"" is surely not to be seen one.",Wild Wild West
30,ironhorse_iv,"While, this movie isn't the best in the west. This steampunk western is a guilty pleasure of mine. I found it, very entertaining, despite its huge flaws. It's pretty wild!",5,6 September 2016,"Yes, I know, a lot of people hate this wastefully-expensive, fluffy comic fantasy and buddy film, but for me, I kinda dig this film. I think the critics were a little harsh on this film. Surprising, it's not as bad, as people make it out to be. Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld and based on the 1965–1969 TV series of the same name by Michael Garrison, the movie tells the story of two government agents, gunslinger James West (Will Smith) & inventor Artemus Gordon (Kevin Kline) who must save President Grant from the clutches of ex-Confederate military engineer turn nineteenth-century super-villain, Dr. Arliss Loveless (Kenneth Branagh). Without spoiling the movie, too much, it's pretty clear, that this movie was made to capitalize on the same success, Sonnenfeld and Smith had with 1997's 'Men in Black'. Instead, of using Sci-fiction comedy, yet again, by making a sequel of that said movie, they choose to go with the hard route, with adapting a TV show, most people in the 1990s, barely heard of, or watch. Having never heard of the show nor the two made-for-TV movie sequels, 1979's 'The Wild Wild West Revisited' and 1980's 'More Wild Wild West', before seeing this film, I can tell you that it didn't take me, out of the movie; yet I can understand, those die-hard fans that did. It's clear, that the movie change a lot of things, when adapting the source material to the big screen. A good example is Dr. Loveless, who went from a dwarf named Miguelito to a man without legs named Arliss. It's clear, that the new character model was created out of the influences of 1964's 'Dr. Strangelove'. I kinda like this change, as it gave the character, a little more reason to be a mad scientist. After all, he's trying to get revenge on the survivors of the war that took away, his means to reproduce. It made him, a lot more memorable. I love the over-the-top acting from Kenneth Branagh, because of that. Another change from the source material is the omission of the hulking giant named Voltaire that use to accomplice him. Instead, we have a series of sexy 'Amazonian' vixens played by Victoria's Secret models and foreign actresses, like Frederique van der Wal, Sofia Eng, Bai Ling, and Musetta Vander. Talk about sex appeal. Also, as much as I love Salma Hayek and her beauty. I found her character to be, somewhat pointless and underused. Her character, Rita Escobar rarely adds anything to the main plot, besides eye candy and love-interest for both the heroes and the villain. Another big chance from the source material was Will Smith as James West. You rarely see black actors in westerns. Turning the original white character to a black character, help build the rivality between them, very well. It also makes somewhat sense within the means of the story as there were many ex-slaves turn cowboys, even if Smith is speaking with some modern slang and dialect. After all, Will Smith's appeal goes a long way toward making up for poor plotting and dialogue. Yet, it's not far enough. There is ton of embarrassing cringe-inducing badly low pace dialogue situations. For example, Smith's dialogue to a white lynch mob about why was he ""drumming"" on a white lady's boobs was a little too long. Then, there is the scene, where Smith is dancing in drag. It went on, forever. I never want to see that, ever again. Even, the ending was somewhat awkward. Still, unlike the others critics, I thought the on-screen chemistry between Smith's character with that of Kline's character was alright for the most part. Still, Kevin Kline is by far, the weaker of the two main leads. Most of his master of disguises jokes and Freudian slips, kinda does fall flat. Honestly, most of the humor does, regardless of the actor in the film. The movie underwent costly re-shoots in an attempt to inject some humor after it was found that test audiences weren't sure if it was supposed to be a comedy. The movie's humor is clunky. That's bad. However, I did like the large amount of gags, we got from the gadgetry from Gordon and Loveless. It's just funny that producer, Jon Peters insisted so hard, on getting a giant mechanical spider be included in a film. He really does love spiders, as he try to do the same, with the fail film adaptation of the comic book, 'The Sandman' & 'Superman Lives'. In many opinion, while the spider part, seem to come out of nowhere, it was visually well done. The effects, by far, is the most appealing part of the film. The action scenes were fun to watch. During the shooting of several sequences involving stunts and pyrotechnics with the metal spider, a planned building fire grew out of control and quickly overwhelmed the local fire crews that were standing by. Much of the town, they wanted to destroyed by the metal spider, was consumed by the fire. Still, they were able to pull off that sequence, with the rest of the budget, they were given. Another thing that critics might be, a little hard on, this film for, is the opening theme song by Elmer Bernstein. I found it, to be really adventurous and upbeat compare to the original by Richard Markowitz. The TV Show version sounds generic. Nothing really stood out with that song. Also, while, Will Smith's 'Wild Wild West' rap song was sub-par, it was a fun tune to listen to, back in the day. Overall: As entertainment, Wild Wild West is mildly fun to watch. It's not the best, but clearly not, the bad or the ugly. It's more a Mild Mild Mess.",Wild Wild West
31,The-Sarkologist,This movie it complete rubbish.,2,26 November 2012,"This movie simply appalls me, and it is not as if I have not given it a go. I have watched it three times now, and the more I watch it the more I hate it. There is so much in this film that disgusts me, such as General Bloodbath McGrath(Ted Levine), and Arlin Loveless (Kenneth Brannagh). It is more than just the characterisations, but the characters themselves. The scene where McGrath empties the ear fluid out of his ear, and simply seeing Loveless with half a body trundle around on a wheeled contraption simply turns my stomach.Then there is the mixing of the characters of West and Gordon. It simply does not seem to work. James West (Will Smith) is a smooth talking, fast shooting, Negro cowboy and Artimes Gordon (Kevin Kleine) is the smart inventor of all strange contractions who also happens to be a US Marshall. Personally, the pairing of these two characters simply does not seem to work, at all. I simply won't even suggest that the whole idea of a heroic Negro in the immediate post civil war period doesn't work, but then again, is this not simply an attempt to rewrite history.Of course, there is the idea of transporting us back to the mid-nineteenth century where industrialisation was taking hold, and then once again rewriting history by adding all these wonderful inventions (the tank, the motorbike, and the aeroplane) years before they actually appeared. Okay, they do say that we shouldn't take this film seriously, but there is significant difference between farce, which you are not supposed to take seriously (such as The Simpsons and Futurama, and even then the Simpsons can take farce just that little too far) and outright stupidity. This film clearly falls into the second category.Simply put, this movie puts a serious stain on the the resume of both Kenneth Branagh and Will Smith. Men in Black was silly, but it was still a good movie. This movie was simply just plain silly. It isn't even a Western, the only thing that makes it such is that it set in the 1800s. There is no taming of the barbaric lands, but rather an evil scientist that must be defeated. In fact, this film seems to take the opposite of the Western where the progress fights between itself, with the good inventor that is Artemis Gordon fighting the evil inventor that is Arlin Loveless.One final thing, while it makes the Negro the hero, it then in turn insults me to no end by turning the disabled white man into the villain who, no longer being able to have sex due to his disability, surrounds himself with beautiful woman as a way of compensating himself and showing off to the rest of the world that he is still a man. I suspect that the women are attracted to him because of the fact that he is no longer a man, and as such are not threatened by him.",Wild Wild West

Though I still don't understand why!! lol You know a movie is in trouble, when they do last minute reshoots (Rogue One being an obvious exception) According to screenwriters S.S. Wilson and Brent Maddock, their original script was almost entirely rewritten, in an attempt to add more action and comedy to a script that was a mostly serious, dialog-driven mystery western. Entire additions, such as the villain, most of the jokes and action scenes, and the entire 3rd act involving the giant spider were new without their input. Wilson and Braddock tried to get their names taken off from the film after seeing the final product, and they have since refused to work with a major studio because of the experience.They even reshot the introduction to Jim West. Belle was originally cast with British actress Phina Oruche. Reportedly, the chemistry needed for the bathtub love scene wasn't there. The scene was recast and re-shot with Garcelle Beauvais. However, Oruche was not told, and found out she was no longer in the film at the premiere in Los Angeles. The characters of ""Spike Guy"" and ""Knife Guy"" were added to the movie and inserted into the climax after test audiences found the heroes fighting only Loveless' beauties to be very odd. Kevin Smith has said that the giant spider was producer Jon Peters' idea for the later- abandoned ""Superman Lives"" project with Nicolas Cage and Tim Burton.This is the first real mis step of Will Smiths move career, as movie is more than a bit of a mess, it's all over the place. After a really good performance in Enemy The State, Will Smith is back to just being Will Smith, which is disappointing!! Kevin Kline is a tad miscast, Kenneth Branagh is simply awful with a bad beard and even worse accent, and sadly Salam Hayek isn't given much to do except look busty in a corset!! Which she looks great doing by the way!! I'd say Her cleavage is the best thing in the movie.Barry Sonnenfeld, Kevin Kline, Salma Hayek and Will Smith all hate this film. Hayek in particular thought she was underused in the final version, while Kline considered himself too good of an actor for the finished product. Oh well, I'm sure they were all well paid...... And at least from Will Smith's perspective, he got a hit single out of it.

There was simply no place for sympathy in a film like this, which is essentially a slapstick comedy with an overload of special effects. In fact, not a single frame of this film is 'normal'.The film also had a lot of racist remarks, but thanks to Will Smith's witty sense of humor, it was actually funny when it could have been offensive. Homosexual connotations galore, they also used any excuse to clad Will and Kevin in women's clothing, making me wonder about director Barry Sonnenfeld's inclinations.The dialogue is witty and well written, the film fast paced and some visuals are really awesome.

35,filipemanuelneto,"Grandiose, showy, but without content.",3,15 February 2020,"Inspired by a television series from the Sixties, this steampunk-inspired film tried to work but failed.The script, set in the years after the Civil War, is simple: two special government agents are sent to the Wild West to stop a mad, confederate scientist without legs who wants to overthrow President Ulysses Grant and avenge the southern defeat. Surreal, to say the least. But being a comedy with touches of nonsense, the lack of credibility is not a problem. The most obvious problem is the predictability, the poverty of the dialogues and also the bad direction of Barry Sonnenfeld, a director who has even given us very satisfying comedies like ""MIB"", ""The Addams Family"" or ""RV"". Here was a complete disaster.Will Smith and Kevin Kline embody the two protagonists, but they never really shone or managed to give soul to the characters they had in hand. I think it is the director's fault, not so much the two actors, who have already proved their worth in other films. Salma Hayek is a good actress, but here she limited herself to using her body and being the hot girl in the film. Kenneth Branagh brought the great villain to life, but he must have bad memories of this film because he was really decadent and seemed to be hating what he was doing.Technically, the film looks impressive and shows where the budget dollars were spent. A grand soundtrack gives the film an unpleasant feeling of smugness, as if the whole film feels better than what it is. The special effects and CGI are great and the mechanisms created for the film, in the best ""steampunk"" style, are impressive but leave doubts about their practical effectiveness. Still, grandiose and look good on the screen. Equally well done were the sets, costumes and choice of filming locations, with incredible settings like the Grand Canyon.Visually, the film is beautiful, it is impressive, but it is like a balloon: it can be big, it can be showy, but it only has air inside.",Wild Wild West

37,southdavid,Wild Wild Worse than I remembered.,2,19 December 2018,"On a whim, I decided to rewatch ""Wild Wild West"" last weekend. I have seen it before, many years before. My memory of it was that it wasn't good. I only really had two recollections from it. The giant mechanical spider and the racial taunts used toward Will Smiths character in a back and forth with the villain. Looking back on it with fresh eyes, it hasn't improved with age.Big Willie is James West, Kevin Klein is Artemus Gordon and Salma Hayek is ... there as well ... as they team up to rescue America's best scientists from evil secessionist Arliss Loveless - hammed up by Kenneth Branagh, and stop him from overthrowing the US Government.You can perhaps forgive some of the films problems by being ""of its time"" a little, but there's no point in not trying to look at this through 2018 eyes. The women in ""Wild Wild West"" have it bad. They are all either prostitutes, or pretty much constantly dressed in their underwear and are there to be leered at by the films other characters. The slurs repeatedly thrown at Smith's James West make for a horribly uncomfortable time, particularly during his first meeting with Loveless. There's such a false equivalency to it, as if West's retorts about Loveless being cut in half are on equal historical footing with hundreds of years of black American experience.But even away from those cultural issues, it's a bad film by any other measure you might apply. You can see the writing issues from abandoned versions of the scripts as plot points disappear and characters come and go with little effect on the story. It's not funny, ever. The tone is so uneven, and the racist and sexist stuff leaves such a bad taste in your mouth that the slaptstick just feels like a bizarre addition. Neither of our heroes is particularly likable, the CGI is poor by today's standards, though I accept that it doesn't look bad for the time. Jon Peter's well documented desire to crowbar a Giant Spider into his film, whether it makes sense or not finally got it's airing here, though the film is massively inconsistent across it's screen time as to what size the spider actually is.It's a mess. A rambling, boring shambles of a film that's only saving grace is that all involved in making it are truly apologetic for it.",Wild Wild West
38,lisafordeay,Definitely a guilty pleasure movie,6,16 September 2020,"1999 was a hit and miss year for Hollywood,some were successful others were flops including Bicentennial Man and the movie adaptation of Wild Wild West.Wild Wild West is directed by Barry Sonnerfield(Men In Black) and stars Will Smith,Kevin Kline playing dual roles,Salma Hayek and Kenneth Branagh. Two agents from the civil war one a survey cowboy,the other is a master of disguise (Smith and Kline)must protect the president of the USA(Kline) from the wheelchair bounded villain Dr Loveless (Kenneth Branagh).
The acting is very OTT especially Kenneth Branagh by god he was just laughable with that southern accent,Kevin Kline as a woman in the beginning was weird(oh and Smith dresses in drag later btw too),and the premise is ridiculously bad.But in saying that and I can't believe I'm saying it but I actually enjoyed this film. No it's not the greatest film in film history, but I guess what drew me to this was Will Smith as I was always a massive fan of his.If you love silly movies then do check it out.",Wild Wild West
39,FiendishDramaturgy,"If This Hadn't Been Associated Wtih The Television Series, It Would Have Done Well!",8,8 January 2009,"Honestly, what most people didn't like about this film is that they cast Will Smith in a part previously carried by a white guy, a popular actor, and the lead of another popular television show, Ba Ba Black Sheep. It insensed many people, and others felt outright insulted. If they had named this ANYthing else, it would have been MUCH more successful. But alas! No one listens to me. LOL It made its money back, barely, but has a horrible rating here at IMDb. I personally think it deserves better than the 4.whatever rating it holds today, but there is further cause for this phenomenon. The South was depicted as insanely ignorant, and the north was given victory only by virtue of Southern capability gone awry. Neither the North NOR the South liked THAT one, I can guarantee it.Me? I don't take sides. The Civil War stops here, with my family line. I had kin who fought on both sides, so I don't share the same prejudices, even though I'm from the South. Otherwise, this is a good movie...a little preachy, but enjoyable nonetheless.I like it. I watch it. I own it. It rates an 8.2/10 from...the Fiend :.",Wild Wild West
40,ebiros2,Not a Bad Movie,7,4 January 2006,"I don't know much about the original TV series, so I don't have any references to compare this movie to. I just saw it as it is: Comedy/Action with bit of odd ball sci-fi mixed in, and it wasn't so bad. Was there crudity in this movie that I didn't detect ? I don't know, but things were pretty light hearted as I saw it and I kind of liked it. I did like the cinematography of this film. The color was nice, and CGI integration I thought was superb. The odd ball couple of Will Smith with Kevin Kline's chemistry worked, and Selma Hayek added feminine touch which wouldn't have existed if it were up to just Smith and Kline. If people didn't like this movie it's probably because it made jokes about everything without any regards to the original plot. I'm offended too when I see a movie that just took cursory ideas from say a good comic book series, and absolutely ruined its concept and artistry. But I have no frame of reference for this movie because I never got acquainted with the original series. Maybe they shouldn't have called it Wild Wild West, and called it an original movie.7/10",Wild Wild West
41,dfranzen70,"Pathetic, heavy-handed mishmash suffers from lack of script",3,21 December 1999,"In Men in Black, Will Smith teamed up with director Barry Sonnenfeld to produce a movie that was high on special effects and perhaps a little low on plot. That film's saving grace was the appealing performances of Smith and Tommy Lee Jones, as well as the clever script, which gave the actors plenty of throwaway lines. With that kind of pedigree, the expectations of the 90's version of the 60's show The Wild, Wild West were fairly high, and the movie was endlessly hyped as yet another 'movie event.'But the result is kind of like Men in Black on a bad day. Smith's character, intended to have the same kind of devil-may-care attitude that Mel Gibson's had in the Lethal Weapon movies, comes off as not only thoroughly obnoxious but also incredibly stupid. We've all seen films in which the protagonist is foolhardy and illogical in his never-ending quest for justice. Smith's Jim West comes off as selfish instead of philanthropic, thick-headed instead of cunning, smug instead of suave. He's not a daring secret agent - he's nothing more than a stereotypical arrogant cop.Smith gives the worst performance in the film, but he's not alone. While Kevin Kline (as Artemus Gordon)and Salma Hayek come off okay, Kenneth Branaugh (yes, the Shakesperian!!) is all wrong as the evil Dr. Loveless. He's way, way, way over the top. For someone who once played Hamlet, this is a major comedown. Can anyone say ""Orson Welles""? I knew you could! Remember when, years after Welles did Macbeth and was a regular in Shakespeare's plays on Broadway, he was found in horrible dreck like Transformers and Slapstick of Another Kind. Is this once-great actor wandering down this path? He may not have Welles' corpulence, but he sure has the hamminess!All in all, this is a waste of energy. Special effects are fine, but in this day and age, they're really not all that special, are they?",Wild Wild West

The rest of the cast is largely wasted,employed merely to stand around sides splitting at Mr West's amusing sallies or scowl at him,depending on which side of the Mason - Dixon line they come from. Frankly it's about time Hollywood forgot about plundering old TV shows and remembered how to make original and stimulating entertainment. Surely that can't be too much to ask?",Wild Wild West
43,r96sk,A brainless watch,8,3 September 2020,"I felt entertained by this.It is a very bonkers film, though it actually works stupidly well in my opinion - the steampunk theme helps it of course. Will Smith and Kevin Kline are a good pairing as West and Gordon. Kenneth Branagh (Arliss) is amusing, I rate his character's design too.I will say the effects around Smith and Kline haven't aged gracefully, but for everything else around them it still looks quite nice. I enjoyed the train shenanigans in particular. Salma Hayek (Rita) is kinda pointless in this, she's basically just there for gratuitous sexual reasons.The film does also try to cram in an (obviously positive) message regarding racists and the such, which doesn't really fit and isn't as developed as could've been. 'Wild Wild West' is at its best when it's being amusing.A brainless watch. I'd, personally, recommend it - though a lot of people would evidently disagree with me.",Wild Wild West

To me this mega budget piece of sci-Western is such a fun summertime Blockbuster with the legendary Will Smith at his most Coolest!!!I will always have huge Nostalgia love for this movie.I went to see will smith on the big screen for the first time ever with Men in Black (1997) & it blew my mind i loved his role & the now classic sci-fi action buddy movie & i became a huge Men In Black fan so a couple of years later i was so excited to see this AWESOME sci-fi action take on the western starring my childhood Hero Will Smith & teamed with the same director from Men in Black again, it was so exciting.I saw ""wild wild West"" at the cinema & i loved it!!! It was exactly what i thought it would be like,it had beautiful stunning scenery,cool gadgets,a massive mechanical spider,amazing action scenes,beautiful stunning sets & the highest production quality & a cool evil fun villain & Will Smith being the coolest he's ever been on screen in my opinion. That whole summer his wild wild West rap song was playing everywhere & i was hooked,i brought it on old cassette tape that's old school that was 1999 & the only other movie that really blew me away that summer or year was the BRILLIANT CLASSIC killer shark Thriller Deep Blue Sea also 1999 it was a great time for big budget summer action & i loved both films so much.A perfect big budget summer blockbuster!!!!I know critics hated WWW & even Smith himself said he doesn't like the movie & feels it's a failure,but i don't care at all as to me in my opinion it was fantastic action packed fun with sci-fi & comedy tossed in with some fantastic scenes & moments it was a very imaginative,fun adventure & I'm glad it got made & i Will always be a fan.A great big budget summer action packed fun adventure with a nice comical duo pairing of Will Smith & Kevin Kline,who have great chemistry & i would've loved to see those guys again in a sequel!!!Will Smith created a slick,cool,witty & heroic hero with Jim West who is iconic to me now. Love the movie & Smith.This fun sci-fi comedy-adventure always puts a smile on my face as soon as i hear the amazing music in the opening montage in it's 70's visual style just magic!!!Can't understand the hate this excellent film got? But i Never listen to critics as i like what i like,it's that simple & most film's they love i usually can't stand!!!WILD WILD WEST is pure 90's adventure-fun with a nice summertime feel to it, a great comic-duo & lots of fantasy steampunk action.

45,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Misunderstood classic,9,18 July 2016,"I don't get the hate for Barry Sonnenfield's Wild Wild West. I just don't. It's like I saw a completely different film than the entire rest of the continent. To my knowledge, there's me and a couple other friends I know who love and cherish it, and the rest of the world has seemingly cast it out into the cold, inexplicably bashing it no end. Wtf. It's a rollicking good time, full of a brilliant blend of situational and slapstick humour, lively characters from a great group of performers, incredible production design, and a dash of swash and buckle. It may not have much in common with the 1960's era TV show its based on, but kudos to it for breaking new ground. Will Smith plays Marshall Jim West, a cocky (there's literally a small window of freeze frame where you can see his ebony schlock in full glory. And don't even ask me how I know that), ballsy (ok sorry I'll stop) secret service cowboy badass who is working a case against some nasty villains who want to use president Ulysses S. Grant for diabolical ends. He's led to old foe General 'Bloodbath' McGrath (Ted Levine in a show stopping, wickedly devious southern psycho role) a confederate lowlife who will hopefully lead him to whoever is kidnapping the nation's best and brightest scientists for some Bond villain-ish scheme. West is joined by kooky inventor Artemis Gordon (a classy Kevin Kline) and the two embark on a shoot em up quest to thwart the evil plan of Dr. Arliss Loveless (Kenneth Branagh), a dastardly mega villain with plans for America that don't involve presidents or laws or anything sane. The film is endlessly inventive, wildly funny and parades forth a reel of set pieces, each more amazing than the last until we realize we're actually watching a fifty foot tall steam punk mechanical spider stomp all over the Utah desert (there's a priceless story involving that and the film's odd duck of a producer Jon Peters, which you can watch Kevin Smith regale an audience with over on YouTube). West and Gordon are joined by sultry Rita (Salma Hayek) a Femme Fatale with a hidden agenda who tags along under the guise of damsel in distress. It's just plain fun and I still don't get how anyone could dislike it. Witty barbs, raunchy double entendres and sarcastic banter permeate the wonderful script. Nifty gadgets, detailed costumes and clanking machinery speckle the epic production design. An atmosphere of playful fun oversees all of it from beginning to end. Smith and Kline make a dysfunctional buddy duo for the ages, squabbling right up until the last frame. Branagh hams it up so far over the top as the bad guy that he nearly implodes on himself. Levine is deliciously creepy and crusty. Watch for other gem performances from Bai Ling, M. Emmett Walsh, Debra Christofferson, Sofia Eng, Rodney A. Grant and Musetta Vander. If you've seen it and already love it, good for you let's go have a beer. If you've seen it and hate it, you're a silly bum (to put it mildly). If you haven't seen it, do so, form your own opinion and fall into one of the above two categories. It's a classic for me.",Wild Wild West
46,TOMNEL,This is one great looking movie...and that's about all.,2,15 November 2008,"Aside from the flashy looks and beautiful scenery of this movie, this is absolutely nothing but corny action, bad dialogue, mediocre acting and nonsensical direction. This film is like filth coated with gold shavings, and beneath it's flashy exterior, there is no other reason to see this, unless you're twelve years old or younger.Evil inventor and confederate Arliss Loveless (Keneth Branaugh) is on the move, and it's up to veteran of the civil war, James West (Will Smith) and good guy inventor Artemis Gordon (Kevin Kline) to stop him. To add to the eye candy, Salma Hayek is thrown in the picture when West and Gordon rescue her from Loveless, and she literally has nothing interesting to say or do, adding to the general tone of the film. When Loveless is out to kill President Ulysses S. Grant, West and Gordon really have to try their darnedest to stop him, but it's not going to be easy, when he has invented a giant mechanical spider. The craziness and chaos ensues.I'll start with the positives, though I have already stated the sole positive aspect of the film. This is a great looking movie. The west has never looked so vibrant and colorful. The special effects add to the dumb and goofy storyline, but they also look really cool.The negatives...where should I start. The acting is not horrible, but it's not good either. Kenneth Branaguh is mainly known for his directing and acting of Shakespearean plays, and in those plays he gives over the top performances. He does the same here, and though he is a fairly dastardly villain, at the same time, it's hard to take him seriously. Will Smith has charisma and charm, but he acts just like he does in every other movie. This is the late 1800s, not 1999, so why does still act like a modern guy? Because that's what the fans want, and that's what the idiot writers came up with. The plot is really stupid, as is the script as is most of this train wreck.Some scenes may look cool, but they don't make sense. For instance, in one scene, the camera is about 30 feet away from the President who is at the opening of a new railroad. Everyone including the president is blissfully unaware that Loveless is coming with the giant improbable spider. We see the spider's giant leg step into frame, and then the President realizes that he is under attack. This little technique used here is trying to surprise the characters and the audience at the same time, but it just doesn't make sense. Why wouldn't the president be able to see the spider before we do? It's coming towards him on a flat plain with no trees. He should be able to see this thing from a mile away, not when it gets right next to him. Another scene features Gordon and West riding on what we assume are horses. The camera backs up, and we see they are actually on the giant spider, and as the camera backs up, we begin to hear the loud noises this machine is making. Why does backing up make us hear the spider, because logically it shouldn't. It's that same awful technique of revealing something to the audience in a scary or humorous manner, whether or not it makes sense.Though I could gaze at this movie's beauty for a long while, at the same time it makes my brain hurt from under use, and my ears bleed from awful dialogue. Eight year old boys will probably give this flick a standing ovation, but most others will start to turn this off as the life gets sucked out of them.My rating: * out of ****. 105 mins. PG-13 for language, violence and some sexual comments.",Wild Wild West

At worst it's an offensively racist, sexist and downright idiotic story that does more to insult the mind than stimulate it.There are so many moments that just completely fall apart at the slightest inspection. Think at all about most scenes and they're just stupid, forced thematically to try and generate a cheap thrill.Salma Hayek is pretty though? So that's a thing.

48,Spleen,When will they learn that special effects are worthless without ...,3,16 April 2000,"Well, `without a decent script' is the standard way to end that sentence, and indeed, the script to `Wild Wild West' is execrable - I'll get to that in a moment.  But I was going to say, `a sense of visual flair'.  A film's special effects are only ever as good as its art direction.  `Wild Wild West' is crammed with computer-manipulated images, and while some of the computer manipulation is convincing enough (although most of it is cheesy) the images themselves are poorly conceived and ugly, ugly, ugly.  No spectacle, no visual delight.  Lots of awful fish-eye lensmanship and unconvincingly lit night scenes.  And look at poor Salma Hayek!  It takes real skill to make her look as unattractive as those costumes and that camera-work make her look.  Overlook every single vice of the script, and the film is STILL bad.I can't recall having seen a more poorly-written comedy.  (I've seen WORSE comedies, with slightly better scripts but without Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh struggling to save them.  Kevin Kline in particular.  Branagh is struggling partly to save the film and partly to keep his accent steady.) The most I will allow is that the `no more mister knife guy' line was sort of amusing, or would have been under other circumstances - but then I'm a sucker for puns.  Otherwise it's pure vacuum.  It's like a comedy written by anthropologists from a far land who know vaguely what comedies look like but don't understand what jokes are.  And yet the theory that it was meant to be a comedy is the most charitable explanation.Still, you can watch the film and then forget that you've seen it, so it doesn't quite rise to the hights of badness inhabited by things like `Showgirls'.  For the most part it's negatively rather than positively bad.",Wild Wild West
49,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,"It's funny here and there,....but feels like it's missing purpose",6,24 May 2013,"Director Barry Sonnenfeld has released a lot of films under his name that aren't exactly what you would call normal films. What I mean by normal is that it does not pertain to the real world. Examples like these are Men In Black (1997) and The Adam's Family (1991). They are not your regular comedy's dealing with normal people. That's a talent Sonnenfeld has - making strange but funny movies. However, Wild Wild West (1999) was a mismatch of ideas and comedy. I can also see why the original stars of the movie weren't pleased with it either because it wasn't anywhere close to the TV show.This particular film sets up the origins to how the two main roles, Jim West and Artemus Gordon come together to save America. But even this isn't done well. The only origin explained is how they meet - there really isn't much of a back-story to any of these characters at all. Jim West even has a girlfriend that only has a very brief introduction and is never explored again. Playing these two main roles are Will Smith (West) and Kevin Kline (Gordon) and to be honest, their on screen chemistry isn't great, but it's also not horrendously terrible.The comedy is really on and off here - a hit or miss. Sometimes Smith and Kline do exchange so remarks that'll spark up a few chuckles, but it is not as frequent as one would hope for. In fact, for the times that aren't funny, they're more awkward instead of just falling flat. Most of this is related to the sexual innuendoes. It just doesn't seem appropriate for the film. It made me uncomfortable to see cross-dressing that didn't look natural or attractive for that matter. I'm amazed that the supporting cast was written to be so dumb to fall for such obvious flaws.The rest of the cast isn't too bad. Salma Hayek is the sex symbol as usual, even though her character is kind of meaningless. She's only there to make the characters of West and Gordon drool and fight for who could bring her to bed with them. M. Emmet Walsh is also a good supporting character even though he doesn't get as much screen time as he deserves. Kenneth Branagh was impressive enough that he could make long speeches that seem to be rich in high vocabulary, although I'll never understand his taste in pets. Another thing that's not explained.It's sad to see that the four writers to this movie all agreed on having the super weapon that the villain wants to use to obtain his goals is by using a giant mechanical spider. I mean, in the 1800s? How ludicrous is that? It's one thing to have a preference for spiders,...but not to model your super weapon after it. Really guys? It's because of this that this movie can not be taken seriously at all. This is where I think director Sonnenfeld could have opened his mouth and said something. But because he's so used to working with weird material, it flew right over his head. Ugh.So along with the few laughs that viewers might get from West and Gordon's wisecracks are the gadgetry and music (sort of). I had a lot of fun with the eye candy in this film. Most of it was because of Gordon's ingeniousness and a little bit of the other things not created by him. To have a mini wrist note pad seems very useful! The score, composed by Elmer Bernstein, wasn't bad either. It had a reoccurring theme and stuck to it. I am curious though to why he didn't stick to the original theme from the TV show....he even hinted at it at one point in the film! Come on...that's proof that you could have stuck to the original theme.The cast, special effects and music isn't bad but instead of sticking to the traditional western genre, director Barry Sonnenfeld decided to keep things weird like the rest of his films. As a result, the comedy can be awkward and villain's show of power is stranger than is menacing.",Wild Wild West
50,eric262003,Nowhere Close To The TV Series,5,26 May 2009,"What's to say about this abysmal excuse for a movie? Ross Martin must be rolling in his grave and I'm sure Robert Conrad is shaking his head in disbelief after this classic television series of the 1960's was transformed into an awful mess thanks to the money-swindling hoodlums that Hollywood employs. What appears to be a Western shoot-out, becomes nothing more than a lame-brained science-fiction bore that garners huge praise along with other classic television shows turned motion pictures like ""The Mod Squad"" and ""The Avengers"". Never one was I ever settled in my seat when I watched it that it left me with an empty feeling inside of me. I was hoping this movie would pay tribute not only to the series but to the Western genre as well. In the end, it failed on both levels. It was much less than I bargained for and the story wasn't very deep. I don't often mind the over-the-top silliness that many films of this kind movie often provide, but in ""Wild Wild West"", the light-heart humor was absent even when it was trying to be funny. The wacky gadgets that Jim West (Will Smith) and Artemus Gordon (Kevin Kline) have in their possession seem more awkward than funny. What was the letdown of the movie is primarily the law of physics. If they would've further concentrated on the timing with the adventure, I would have rated this movie a little higher. There was just so much nonsense with this movie I feel even a five was a bit too much.The strong qualities in the movie are the special effects (some things were cool, others were banal)and as always Salma Hayak looks great and as always gives it her all performance-wise. But the weak point is that there's nothing remotely funny about this movie. It tries to manipulate you into thinking it's funny,but it fails to reach its goal. It did not even reach the pinnacle as nagging amusement. It was just plain annoying and a total waste. You can find better things to do with your life than to watch this turkey.",Wild Wild West
51,Gislef,Eh...,6,6 July 1999,"I would only comment that it was...well, okay.  I had no problems with the rivalry between the two agents:  the show never presented their ""first meeting"" (although one episode kind of hints at it in a really vague oblique manner).  I thought that bad pun/humor level was well within the standards the series itself established.  I didn't mind the sexual innuendo per se except for the numerous homosexual jibes.  Yeah, the movie is about two guys who travel together and fight crime, but if they'd tossed in as much homosexual innuendo in Men in Black, it would have been a much less funny movie.The movie also spends too much time on the drag sequences, to the point where it crashes to a screeching halt repeatedly every time they returned to their concept.  Yeah, they did that on the series too _very_ rarely, but I guess I don't share Peters and Sonnenfeld's glee in the subject matter.For the actors, Kline was probably the best, I wouldn't describe hm as wooden (and was he doing Grant throughout the entire movie as well?  We weren't sure about that).  Smith was...competent.  Brannagh was over-the-top, but there were times when that seemed to work and times when it didn't.  Hayek was wasted. Ted Levine has yet to give a decent performance that I've seen, and WWW was no exception.The plot was...okay.  There were some gaping plot holes (a couple of cannon shots would seem to demolish the spider - Loveless is going to threaten the entire U.S. with this??), and a couple of dead ends (so what if Rita is Escobar's wife?  What's the point of Gordon impersonating Grant at Promonitory Point as a delay that results in West getting shot ten seconds later?)As everyone else has commented, the sets and design were gorgeous.  I liked the person-in-a-painting motif at Loveless' manor (the rifleman sequence was interesting), although the Spider bit was never explained.Overall, there was enough there to remind me of the old series, but if it somehow becomes a series of movies, they could drop all the drag humor and homosexual innuendo (M. Emmet Walsh just look embarrassed to have to react to it), not rehash the plot quite so many times (Kevin Kline recaps the plot verbatim at least twice), and find a decent follow-up villain, and they might be set for a long-running franchise.",Wild Wild West
52,baumer,This is not a movie,1,5 July 1999,"This is not a movie. It is not even a pale imitation of one.  A movie is supposed to be something that either entertains, makes you laugh, makes you think, dazzles you with visuals, makes you sad, makes you angry, makes you ponder things that you never did before, makes you happy to be alive, makes you any number of things.  This movie did one thing and that was make me mad.  But not because they were manipulating my emotions to draw that emotion out of me towards any one character or situation, no, they made me mad that I was sitting in the theater watching this piece of garbage. This is not a movie, it is a bunch of scenarios filmed together that has the illusion of a film.  This was a thing that gave Will Smith an extra 20 million in his bank account.  This was not a movie, not even close.  As much as I hated Jaws 4, I hated this one even more.  At least in Jaws 4 you could laugh at the absurdity of the whole thing.  But not this.  I think I laughed once, and that was just because I needed to.  It's like taking a breath in a room filled with poisonous gas.  You don't want to, but you have to, you need to.This is a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad movie.  Oops sorry, there's that word again.  Movie.

53,Beta_Gallinger,"With little excitement and pretty much no real humour, this movie is a definite failure",4,24 November 2007,"I saw the music video for Will Smith's ""Wild Wild West"" probably back when it was a current song, but for years, I knew very little about the movie. In fact, I just watched it for the first time eight years after its release. Since the IMDb rating is 4.1/10, it's obvious that this 1999 blockbuster isn't very popular, and after watching it myself, while it clearly wasn't as bad an experience for me as it was for certain other nay-sayers, I am not left wondering why.A former Civil War hero named Capt. Jim West meets a U.S. Marshal named Artemus Gordon while attempting to kill General ""Bloodbath"" McGrath. At the White House, the two meet President Ulysses S. Grant, who sends them both on a mission together to stop Dr. Arliss Loveless, an evil inventor who is a threat to the United States of America, and has recently abducted many great scientists! Unfortunately for West and Gordon, this mission will be made more difficult by a number of things, including some of Loveless' clever, life-threatening inventions! If you ask me, ""Wild Wild West"" does have some reasonable action sequences, and I definitely did occasionally find myself in mild suspense, but overall, it fails as an action movie, as most of it doesn't work, and is just plain boring. This 1999 blockbuster also fails miserably as a comedy, with one lame or mediocre gag after another. I did smile a bit, but don't recall ever actually laughing at any point. One gag I can remember off the top of my head is the ""She's a breath of fresh a#%.""/""She's a breast of fresh air"" one, which definitely counts as a lame gag. Loveless' inventions add a sci-fi touch to this primarily western movie, which gets a tad awkward. Towards the end of the film, it gets even more tiring than before.I have never seen any episodes of ""The Wild Wild West"", the 1960's TV series which this movie is based on, but it seems to be very popular with those who have seen it, unlike this 1999 flop. Without a doubt, this film was a letdown after the successful ""Men in Black"", a film which, just like this one, was directed by Barry Sonnenfeld and features Will Smith in a starring role. Since this movie flopped and the original TV series obviously didn't if it had a movie based on it made thirty years later, I think it's fair to say that whether you've ever seen episodes of the show or not, and whether you like the show or not if you have seen it, it's probably best to skip this movie.",Wild Wild West
54,jhclues,Not Really So Wild,1,10 September 2000,"This is a project that had everything going for it:  A terrific cast, a director with a proven track record, great special effects, a huge budget and the promise of being the heir apparent of a successful television series.  So what went wrong?  Because `Wild Wild West,' directed by Barry Sonnenfeld, is...well, just not very good.  It's a case, apparently, of everything being poised for greatness until it all went south.  And that's pretty much the bottom line here; nothing about this film works.  Nothing. Not that everyone didn't try hard, because it's obvious that they did, right down to the last man and the last lame joke.  It reminds me of a line from `Mystery Men':  Someone refers to another as being `mysterious;' someone else says, `That's it?  He's mysterious?'  `Well,' is the reply, `He's VERY mysterious.'  Did they try hard in this one?  They tried VERY hard.  But, very simply, nothing worked.  The usually charismatic Will Smith (James West) didn't even have that working for him here; Kevin Kline (Artemus) didn't fare any better, and Kenneth Branagh (Dr. Loveless) proved to be one of the most forgettable villains in the history of the cinema.  His over-the-top performance could do nothing to salvage a character that was anemic and uninteresting to begin with.  As for Salma Hayek, it's nothing more than a case of a beautiful, talented actress being used as window dressing; and here it's like putting curtains on the windows of the Titanic even as it's sinking. 	Sonnenfeld will have to accept his share of the blame, since the director, above and beyond everyone else, should have seen what was happening as filming progressed (or in this case, regressed).  It's hard to figure how the man who gave us `Men In Black' and `Get Shorty' (among others) could have let this one slip so badly.  It's downright confusing as to how such enormously talented people could come together and go so awry in their endeavors.  The principles here all have proven themselves elsewhere as masters of impeccable timing, whether it be in comedy, drama or action features, yet even that falls flat here.  It's as if this project had a `Jonah' on it from the beginning.  As far as the plot is concerned, I will not divulge any salient points; unfortunately, there is nothing significant enough to divulge.  There are a number of jokes scattered throughout the movie that are not only bad, but seem as if they were an afterthought, possibly added to a scene only when repairs could not be effected in the editing room. 	If you have not yet seen this movie, and if you are a fan of Will Smith, Kevin Kline, Kenneth Branagh or Salma Hayek, or if you have fond memories of the T.V. series that spawned this film, do yourself a favor:  Rent or buy `Enemy of the State,' `A Fish Called Wanda,' `Much Ado About Nothing,' or `Fools Rush In,' and let this one go.  Protect those fond memories.  If you absolutely must have a taste of this, try to catch the music video with Smith doing the title song.  That video is the best thing about this whole project, and Hayek has a much more significant part in it than she does in the movie.  Twenty years or so from now, someone will ask Smith what went wrong with `Wild Wild West;' and he'll probably reply, `Who knows?  It just didn't work.'  As for now, all anyone can say is, `Who Knows?  It just didn't work.'  And that about sums it up.  I rate this one 1/10.",Wild Wild West
55,Mister-6,"Mild Mild ""West""...",3,9 January 2000,"I didn't care much for the original ""Wild Wild West"" series as I thought sometimes it was too smarmy for its own good.  Compared to this big budget misfire, though, the TV series is a classic in sophisticated wit and sharp social commentary (as its fans no doubt attest to already, but no matter...).Let's get the biggest problem with the big-screen's ""Wild Wild West"" out of the way early: it has no sharply defined story.  All right, it DOES deal with how Loveless (Branagh) kidnaps brilliant scientists to construct a huge metallic spider to kidnap President Grant to make him surrender the good old US of A to foreign interests.  But there are so many useless side stories that go nowhere and extra characters that make no sense in any sub-text that the story gets fuzzy and becomes static at best, secondary to the FX at worst.Did anyone think Will Smith and Kevin Kline worked well together?  We're talking two completely different acting styles here that don't mesh - brash, hip and street-smart (Smith) and classically-trained ""legit"" theater (Kline).  It's not that they don't do well in the movie, but they just don't do that well in the scenes they have together - and since they're playing James West and Artemus Gordon, respectively, a lot depends (and fails) on that.And what was Salma Hayek's purpose?  Romantic interest?  Window dressing? Just plopping a woman into the center of the plot because there was one in ""Men in Black"", Sonnenfield's previous collaboration with Smith?  Remember, Linda Fiorentino actually played a character that was important to the plot - and she was an actress (sorry, Salma) suited to the role.  All Salma does is be beautiful.  Though she's good at it, there's not much more to her part than that.Levine is unrecognizable under tons of makeup as Bloodbath McGrath, but he also gives the most creative and active performance of the group (well, him and Kline).  Branagh does what he can in a part where it's all you can do but think about where they put the matte lines.  And what was with Loveless' women?  More window dressing, you'd think, and you'd be right.  Hire models and you GET models.The special effects are good, though.  The huge spider that terrorizes the Old West is well-done and the metal collars/ spinning blades scenes are imaginative.  But then there's the story again.I was totally under-whelmed.  A plot like this needs urgency but with all those writers laboring over the script (and you can bet there were that many more script-doctors brought in) you can safely believe that coherency is going to be the last product brought forth.One more point: Will can certainly handle a gun with the best of them, but he never seemed that interested in the goings-on.  It's like he was caught in a time warp and, oddly enough, is the only black person we see during the whole movie.  Is that a statement?  Probably, but not an affirmative one.
In the end, all you're left with is good FX in service of a bad movie. That usually isn't a bad thing, but when the aforementioned movie cost almost 200 million dollars to make... THEN it's a bad thing.Three stars for ""Wild Wild West"", one for each word in the title.

61,Son_of_Mansfield,An insult to a beloved show.,1,26 May 2003,"""The Wild Wild West"" was a fun series, kind of like James Bond crossed with a buddy cop series in the west. It deserves better than this sad attempt at the continuing reign of Will Smith on the 4th of July. The casting of Will Smith as a secret service agent in the 1860s is a dumb coice and the ""jokes"" where white people come close to calling him names are not funny. The original James West, Robert Conrad, voiced his displeasure with this clear marketing move. The only lead that was cast well was Kevin Kline as Artemus Gordon. He does not reach the warmth of Ross Martin, the original, but is the source of humor, however strained and purile. Throughout the series there was villain who always brought a smile when he appeared, Dr. Migeleto Loveless, one of the most sophisticated villains. Like the greatest of villains, his only flaw is the arrogance that makes him underestimate his opponent. How does this film pay him respect? They turn him into an ignorant redneck who kidnaps scientists. An insult to the character and to Kenneth Branagh. The saddest aspect of the casting is that a prime choice existed. Warwick Davis (Willow) would have perfect for Dr. Loveless and someone impersonating Tom Selleck would have pulled this movie up out of the gutter. The only other necessity would be a script that paid more attention to the series. As it is, this movie is an annoying loser.",Wild Wild West
62,DarthVoorhees,It's as bad as the rumors lead you to believe...,2,4 May 2011,"If not worse... 'Wild Wild West' is an absolute train wreck of a movie. It existed only to make money and sequels and luckily America's movie going public wasn't stupid enough to warrant a Wild Wild West 2 but they are stupid enough to indulge Will Smith's massive ego which I think is the greatest problem with this picture. I can tolerate giant metal spiders but I can't tolerate a performance like the one we get from Will Smith in this film. To put it bluntly I think this performance is bad enough that it should have completed killed his career...The fake breasted women and giant spiders are stupid to be sure but I don't think these are the major problems with the film. I could totally get behind a movie that tries to do James Bond stuff in the wild west. I think the western lends it's self well to genre bending. I am a huge fan of the short lived Bruce Campbell show 'Brisco County Jr' and they did stuff much sillier than what is done in 'Wild Wild West'. I think the problem I had with the spider and the women are that they are played for gags. The entirety of the scene with Kline's fake breasts is based on tiredly setting up gags. Gags aren't funny. They showcase lazy writing and are placed in abundance when a comedy can't generate humor off the plot and characters development. These characters are so boring and cliché that gags have to be used. The fact that the climax and main threat of the film is giant eye sore of a gag kind of ruins what ever chance this movie had of having any kind of credibility. The gag isn't even that good in terms of gags. Will Smith merely says ""he's got an eighty foot tarantula"" and Kline goes ""I was just getting to that"". Really? Can't come up with a spider related gag? Have to just narrate the scene and hope it amuses people? And yet this isn't why I hate this movie. I could tolerate gags to the point of merely seeing a mediocre film but the problem with 'Wild Wild West' is who is delivering these gags, Will Smith. Smith's performance in this thing is probably close to being one of the worst I've seen on film. Why? Because it's reeks of foolish arrogance. Smith thinks he's a million bucks on the screen and it shows. It's a surprisingly pretentious performance coming into an extremely stupid movie. Smith plays this West character like the classical action heroes did during this time. He tries to move slickly and stylishly and sound like he knows everything about everything. The problem with this is that when the movie is as stupid as 'Wild Wild West' Smith becomes condescending to the audience. It's not that he takes this material seriously that bothers me but that he shoves this material in our face. And this is only the action hero piece of the story, the comedy side is far worse. When Smith is forced to set up a joke he acts like this West figure is too cool to degrade himself to stupid stuff. The audience degrades themselves and so should Smith. Of course it leads up to him wearing a dress and the moment is uncomfortable in the sense that Smith plays this West to the point where we think the way he builds this up showcases a sexual repression worthy of the darkest nightmares of Freud. And they of course have to include racial humor because we are dealing with the Civil War era. All this racial humor consists of is Smith saying how stupid the rednecks around him are and making fun of them for being backwards southerners. This approach of having backwards hicks only works so far until we meet Dr. Arliss Loveless. There comes a moment when West is actually about to be lynched for bonging a women's breasts and the speech West gives is just about the most unfunny awkward line delivered in any comedy I've ever seen.I guess it goes to show you that even throwing cheap emotional triggers like racism in a film don't work unless the characters are the least bit compelling. It shows a sense of desperation that since the film can't make us care about West they have to remind us of such a dark era in our nation's past. I'm surprised more people weren't gravely offended by the racial stuff in this film because the thought of using such heavy material in such sap for the sake of doing so is offensive to me. The scene were I just about felt like muting everything Smith said was when he tells the story of his family and his flight from slavery. West tries to show how rugged and tough he is by eating a charred lizard because he was taught by Indians. I don't care and I find it offensive and perpetuating even more stereotypes as it tries to have a heavy tender moment. God bless Kenneth Branagh! He's the only thing that comes close to being watchable in this film but even he gives the worst performance of his career here. Arliss is an entertaining villain and I gravitated towards him simply because he sought out to do what I wanted to do, kill Jim West. Branagh seems to be having quite the fun time in this role and some scenes involving Loveless are entertaining particularly his introduction and his speech to the foreign delegates aboard his spider. If you find yourself having to see this film use your DVD remote to make it a one man show starring Branagh. I wanted this villain to win despite the fact that they show him as a poorly written racist.",Wild Wild West

64,Movie-12,Contains so many flaws I could not keep up with them all. But it was a wild ride. *1/2 out of ****,4,17 July 1999,"WILD WILD WEST (1999) *1/2""Wild Wild West"" stars Will Smith as Jim West, an undercover secret agent cowboy who likes to shoot first and investigate later. The film takes place over 100 years ago, right at the point of the continental railroad connecting. Jim and his new partner, Artemus Gordon, a master of disguise and invention, are assigned to recover a group of the worlds most intelligent scientists from a madman named General Bloodbath. They try to investigate in two main ways: Gordon uses costumes trick Bloodbath, while West uses force.There is another character in the story, however, and his name is Dr. Arliss Loveless, a traitor whose lower half was blown out from underneath him during the recent war. He demands that the United States surrender their freedom to him and his accomplices. So he kills General Bloodbath and uses the scientists that he stole for a brilliant masterpiece war weapon shaped like a giant spider and can blow out fire balls from its mouth.""Wild Wild West"" is so completely filled with problems and obvious flaws that I could not catch all of them in my notes. I'll explain each and every one of them that I caught-but first lets begin with structure: The film opens to what seems like a standard three act formula (the kidnapped scientists being the problem, the evil General Bloodbath being the main villain, the two secret agents being the hero). The problem begins about a third way through when the film opens a brand new problem and villain; Dr. Loveless wants to take over the world and West and Gordon must stop him. Great, that sounds O.K, right? Wrong. What ever happened to the kidnapped scientists? Did Loveless let them go? Absolutely not. He is the scum of the universe and we're supposed believe that our villain is going to release his hostages. I think Not. But the audience doesn't know what to believe because the movie just drops the subject like it never existed. Now, this did not have to be such a problem if the filmmakers used the changing of events as a false first act. However, they didn't even attempt to solve the first initial problem. Thus, already we have a major doubt in the production.Second, let's look at the movie's characters: Most of the characters used in ""Wild Wild West"" are never developed and are operated as plot puppets, not having any mind of their own. But one in particular stands out in my mind as of being a complete waste of acting, the Salma Hayek character, whose name is Rita. First of all, she appears about a third way though the film and is rescued by Gordon. She then severs the propose as a tag along to West and Gordon when we learn that she is an assistant of Dr. Loveless, but later we learn that this is also not true. After Loveless steals her back from the heroes, she disappears from the film completely, never to be seen again until the happy and peachy premise to tell the heroes that she is doing oka y and to wish her luck with life. Lets see, her presence in the movie is to be what?Now, lets take a look at the stupidity of the plot of ""Wild Wild West,"" as if I haven't already screwed up any chance of someone desiring to view it, here's some more to straighten my opinion. The horses in the film appear at random for convenience of the characters. The giant robotic fire-breathing spider controlled by Loveless is supposed to make us believe that America will surrender on its knees, but our two heroes take care of this ""major"" problem in ten minutes, proving just what little problem it severed. Gordon discovers and invents the theory of flight in what seems like five minutes. The heroes try for ten minutes to try to get a certain magnet off their neck, but for as big a deal that it possesses in the movie, the filmmakers never do show them taking off the obstacle. As long as you can look yourself in the eye, and remember that the hero never dies the first time though, and continue to want to drive all the way to the theater and pay top prices for this junk pile, I'll say that your one opinionated person.Some of the movie does work. For instance, Will Smith and Kevin Kline are wonderful as the title roles, bringing a sometimes funny tone to the film-breathing some life into it.  And Kenneth Branagh as Dr. Loveless, superb and perfect, way over the top resulting in a ideally crafted villain. For a buddy comedy the music isn't all that bad either.This is the second film of Will Smith's opening of the fourth of July weekend and I am sure many people will go see it. Why do audiences fall for filmmakers' scams? It is obvious at the negativity generated from the critics that this film is no good. And by watching the previews someone surely can tell that it is no Oscar worthy material. Like the upcoming ""Lake Placid,"" however, the built up hype is nothing more that a bunch of hot air in a balloon that will surly come splattering out when word of mouth comes around.",Wild Wild West

Now, modern filmmakers, being the doofy flakes that they are, probably thought: is there any reason why James West cannot be ...Will Smith? Well, I could have told them why: because for all these years he's been Conrad! And Conrad certainly brought a unique sensibility to the role: the way he carried himself makes it difficult to imagine ANYONE else as West, let alone an actor specializing in easygoing comedy. Will Smith's comic timing worked well in ""Independence Day"" and great in ""Men in Black"", but is totally inappropriate for this part. They might as well have given him a different name, maybe as a replacement for the real Jim West. Of course, modern filmmakers, being the doofuses that they are, also thought, is there any reason we cannot include a giant spider in this movie, but the other Smith (Kevin) has already explained enough on that subject. Will Smith's chemistry with partner Gordon (Kline) is OK, but seems strained at points. English actor Branagh plays villain Loveless with a thick Southern accent to the point of self-mockery.

Don't get me wrong, I obviously love her (and you get to see a little more of Selma than you might be used to), and she has never looked better in my opinion, but her character served no purpose. If you took her character out of the movie, nothing would change. I realize that in an action film geared towards a male demographic, you need to put a woman into the action, but at least make her have a point. Look at other 1999 action releases like The Phantom Menace, The Matrix, and The Mummy. All three were action films geared primarily towards young males and all three had beautiful female leads, but the difference between those three movies and this one was that those females leads had important roles that played an integral part in the film. Smith was his usual enjoyable self. Too bad he didn't have a character that was interesting. Kline's Artemus Gordon was fun enough, but for a guy who was really into gadgets, we didn't get to see a whole lot of fun ones that I thought would have made the movie more fun. Branagh was, well interesting as the legless Loveless. Didn't really figure out where the character was from. He was supposed to be from the South, yet at times sounded like he was from England trying to do an American accent.  The supporting cast was OK, and not very memorable.

Nor is there brilliance in transforming the image of the lead character just so that they could build the role around star-of-the-moment Will Smith. But out of that horribly perverse example of Hollywood commercial packaging there is an intriguing premise, which naturally seems to have slipped past all involved without a second glance. What if the best, brightest and most intrepid government agent working in post-Civil War America was, indeed, a black man? Realistically, how would an African-American, functioning in a repressive, racist society, where even the most liberal thinker would see him as a second-class citizen, indeed, a second class human being, be able to not only outsmart the bad guys, but to impress even the skeptical good guys? It is an intriguing idea because, on the one hand, such an agent would not be suspected of being a threat and, on the other hand, he would have to overcome so many more barriers than a white man would ever face. He would be both invisible and yet stand out like the proverbial sore thumb just about anywhere he went. He'd be constantly fighting two battles. Such a film could be thrilling and funny, yet something rare: original.""The Wild Wild West"" TV show itself was all those things: it was highly derivative of both the traditional western and the then-fresh James Bond-style spy movie -- with more than a little bit of Batman-style comic book campiness kicked in -- yet it was ingenious in the way it melded those mythic genres into a one-of-a-kind series. There was never anything quite like ""The Wild Wild West"" and never anything since -- including this disastrous 1997 movie.Everything about WILD WILD WEST, the movie, is just plain bad: tacky special effects; clumsy direction; an embarrassing screenplay; plus a fine, bewildered cast wasted in totally unworkable roles. But as bad as everything else is, the base rot of WWW goes directly to its reworked premise. No matter how open minded one might be, or how much one prides oneself on being socially color blind, there is just no way to honestly accept replacing Robert Conrad, TV's James West, with Will Smith. The time and the place dictate that James West be a white male -- unless, the filmmakers acknowledge and embrace the incongruity and use it for a real purpose.Yet, the filmmakers want it both ways: the audience is expected to be able to ignore Smith's skin color, while at the same time the entire plot is based on his confrontation with a white racist trying to reestablish Confederate power and seize control of the U.S. government. How can you respect or believe in a film or filmmakers that get all preachy about the evils of racism while all along dealing with the issue with absolutely no respect for historical honesty? It is not clear if having Smith play James West as a cocky, street smart, John Shaft-style character was intended to be a joke, social commentary or just absurd politically correct pandering to black audiences, but it is clear that it does not work. The most outrageously unbelievable thing about WILD WILD WEST is not the wildly improbable sci-fi inventions but that the Smith character actually makes it to the end of the film without being lynched. It's not that the anachronism of a cocksure 20th century black man confronting 19th century bigotry isn't workable, because that very time-warp racial comedy had already been done with much greater success in the Mel Brooks classic, BLAZING SADDLES. Unlike WWW, Brooks and company realized the sheer idiocy of the premise, yet used that to mock both the black and the white stereotypes with equal glee.Where BLAZING SADDLES is an honest farce, WILD WILD WEST is dishonest and cowardly. All involved probably thought they were being pretty daring by flaunting convention and hiring Smith, but they did not hire Will Smith the African American, they hired Will Smith the action hero movie star. They built WILD WILD WEST around Smith's race, but only to exploit his contemporary Hollywood image, even to the point of letting him create and perform a totally inappropriate (and totally bad) rap song at the end. You can sense the film exploiting both Smith's star image and his race, while not wishing to risk challenging either. The film tries to reinvent ""The Wild Wild West"" TV show, but the changes are literally skin deep. To really explore and compare racism in America by blending the attitudes of two different American centuries would have been too wild wild of an idea for these timid timid filmmakers.",Wild Wild West
73,Med-Jasta,Alright...,5,21 January 2020,Having finally seeing this movie 20 years after it came out I can honestly say it's fine. There's some great Will Smith moments and it's not terrible. The end feels rushed and some humor feels forced. It really feels more like a kids movie. Except for all those innuendos... Kenneth Branagh is just terrible in this. But he's a good actor so he must have been misdirected.,Wild Wild West
74,jwscott-home,One of the funniest movies I've ever seen!,9,27 January 2020,"I watched this in the theatre when it first came out and at least 4 times since on cable tv etc... this is a comedy... I was flipped out that such a funny flick like this with great acting by, at that time newcomer Will Smith. I tire with IMDb and I pay no attention to the regular reviews but I do put some worth in the individual metacritic reviews. I said individual MC not the avg MC rating. Why? First because lots of folks don't think comedies are credible and aren't really movies so they must be bad, right. Only serious movies apply for a 'good rating'. Usually I rate movies on here, and I've been rating them since the first yr IMDb opened its website, based simply on whether or not I was entertained.. ie: laughed, or cried, or haunted or on the edge of my seat. This movie was hilarious and what a good intros to the Feesh Prince. And while this isn't usually the case in 2020 it was clear racism that drew all the negative reviews. I mean here's the funniest, most enigmatic, great young actor we had seen in years and Hollywood wasn't ready for a superstar black man, let a lone a rapper who had his own sitcom... the talent this kid had at an early age was incredible. In later years he slowed down and his agency made some bad picture decisions as often happens but part of it is that ..is he's taken time out to raise his family.. wow what a novice idea for a typical ego minded Hollywood Star... He's coming back in full for e now in 2020 now that his kids- are raised and I expect to see many more great movies with him being as funny and over the top as ever. But so sad this movie was rated so badly. The entertainment value was a 10.",Wild Wild West
75,moviewiz-4,Good in effects,8,5 May 2001,"My high rating is for the effect and the comedy. When i seen the mechanic spider, i wonder, how can they do it, it so real and exciting.One of Mr Smith best movie, the comedy all add up to make this one a must seen film. Quite a nice plot and props, like the settings and music.",Wild Wild West
76,aramis-112-804880,"Same Names, Different Characters",3,28 June 2021,"In the original ""The Wild Wild West"" series no backstory exists to show how West and Gordon met. This, I suppose, fills that bill, probably in the forlorn expectation of as series of movies to follow. Tough luck on that.What boggles the mind is that Studios take beloved old properties (""The Wild Wild West"", ""The Avenger"", etc.) and then eliminate everything that made the old series work and that people loved about them. In the original ""Avengers"" Steed and Mrs. Peel were equals (though Steed was the more experienced agent). They did not bicker, but went about their duties reliant on each other in a non-sexual context. In the movie, Steed was turned into a cowardly type and Mrs. Peel was . . . Weird. And they did not get along.""The Wild Wild West"" was the American ""Avengers"" with West and Gordon working, either separately or together, in perfect amity, against a bizarre gallery of ghouls and weirdos with pre-Steampunk gadgets. Here, they squabble.The casting is okay. For those of us who are color-blind it doesn't matter who plays what, so long as they do their job. Will Smith is usually pretty good and he has (or had at that time) star power. And Kevin Kline was probably the perfect choice for Gordon. I might have chosen him myself. Though I'd have made him competent as he is in the series.But here's the philosophical problem: when a ""Wild Wild West"" or an ""Avengers"" is taken into the hands of new people (or, in the case of ""Twin Peaks"" where David Lynch did it to himself) is it more important to recreate the conditions of the original to satisfy the fan-base, or to make it different in a way that attracts a potential new audience? If the latter, why not just steal the premise and change it with different characters? Or is it just that script writers, notorious for changing original source materials, think they're better than the original writers (of novels or a beloved old series)? Watching the rebooted ""Wild Wild West"" is like watching a movie made of Harry Potter with the magic removed.If you're a ""Wild Wild West"" fan who remembers the series fondly and would like to revisit it, stay away. If you are unfamiliar with the old series, or if you're capable of seeing this as a wholly new thing that simply uses familiar names, you might enjoy parts of it.The biggest disappointment is probably Kenneth Branagh, arguably the best actor of my generation (I'm only a few months younger than he). His character, Dr. Loveless, had his first name changed, and his affiliation. Rather than being a little person with an obsession with killing lots of people to overturn the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, he's an amputee who is a bitter, old Confederate. And though the English usually do a better job of southern accents than Americans, Branagh is Irish and he pays America back for Dick Van Dyke's accent in ""Mary Poppins.""Overall, not a good movie in itself, much less as a reboot of a beloved old property. But it deserves some stars for its look. Too bad they didn't spend as much craftsmanship on the script.",Wild Wild West

79,Gubby-Allen,Crap,3,16 March 2002,"This had the premise of a good film, in fact reading about it (even having seen it) it still sounds good. Modern made Westerns are often good & the idea of a black man being the central character of one is good so far. Will Smith, Kevin Kline & Kenneth Brannagh are all great actors (unfortunately the rest of the main cast are crap), and the characters of Kline & Smith were great too. So what was wrong with it? 2 words: 'The' and 'plot'. It was as weak as p***. Like it had been put together in 2 minutes for a childs cartoon. It just gave good actors  good characters nothing to work with. I'd still like to see a Wild West 2, as I said, the premise is a good one. It just needs a storyline to at least stop the viewer from slipping in & out of sleep for 90 minutes.I would though like to see Will Smith stick to comedies. Like Eddie Murphy & Leslie Nielson they're made to make people laugh. Both of those have attempted 'serious' films with no great success. Hopefully this will be the end of Will's attempts at non humorous films.3/10 (for everything other than the plot being ok).",Wild Wild West
80,Indy-52,i liked it!,6,29 January 2000,"since i've got a new computer with a standard DVD player on it, but no Digital Versatile Disc, i decided to rent one to see if this whole hype is true. I thought i'd see The Matrix, but since it was rented out (wouldn't you know it), i took Wild Wild West from the shelf, because i saw it had a lot of extra documentaries and heard it had a lot of special effects. I didn't really take because i thought that it would be a very good movie, because i had already heard it was bad. So, you can imagine, i had very low expectations of it and i only watched for the extras. But, i found out this movie is pretty good! I liked it from the beginning to the end. The credits sequence i liked very much, and everything that came after it. True, it had a very thin plot and true, it was a bit silly at times, but it's not meant to be taken seriously. It has a lot of funny moments and i loved all those crazy gadgets. Will Smith again gives us a great comedic performance, although his character is very much like J from Men in Black. He and Kevin Kline have great chemistry and make a very good team. The only low point of the movie is the villain: he isn't scary, or funny, or menacing at all. Arliss Loveless is a very boring and sometimes irritating villain. But i liked every single scene that involved James and Artemus getting in trouble and trying to get out of it. If you're in the right mood for a silly movie, and don't take it too seriously, then i think you'll like it.Don't read negative reviews about it: they'll give a wrong idea of it.",Wild Wild West
81,Brogan,WILD WILD FUN!!!!!,9,30 June 1999,"Leave it to Barry Sonnenfeld the director of GET SHORTY and MEN IN BLACK to do a faithful and exciting new version of the classic 1960's t.v. series.  This is one hell of a exciting and fun movie!  I haven't felt like a child when watching a fun movie since JURASSIC PARK.  This is one summer movie that promises the goods, and delivers! Will Smith plays Jim West, a U.S. Army officer who along with a U.S. Marshall, Artemus Gordon (Kevin Kline), are ordered by President Grant to search and find the top U.S. scientists who were kidnapped.  Along the adventure they meet a beautiful and mysterous woman named Rita Escobay (Salma Hayek) who is also looking for one of the missing scientists.  Then they realize that kidnapper is a powerful, evil, and legless Dr. Arliss Loveless (Kenneth Branagh), who has an extremely devious plan. First of all, this is no CITIZEN KANE, SCHINDLER'S LIST, or 2001, it's not a thinking movie.  This is a summer film, it's supposed to be fun and exciting, and fun and exciting it is! The action scenes are very exciting and original. The effects are very top-notch (close to STAR WARS standards). The gadgets from Artemus Gordon are very cool.  And the acting is very much well done. I'm sure that die hard fans of the t.v. series aren't going to accept Will Smith playing Jim West,  but Smith does a good job!  He is funny, witty, and very charming, he plays a very good action hero.  And Salma Hayek is very very sexy as Rita Escobar, I've seen almost all of her movies, and I have never seen Hayek as beautiful as she was in this film. But the two stand-outs in acting are the two Shakespeareian actors, Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh.  Kevin Kline is perfect (as usual) as the highly intelligent and witty Artemus Gordon.  He fits the role perfect since Gordon is the smart one of the two heroes.  And Kenneth Branagh is the most fun and best villain that I have seen in years.  He was both cruel and very funny at the same time, you like him, yet you want to hate him at the same time.  It's fun watching both West and Loveless take cracks about one another. This is the perfect film of the Sonnenfeld trilogy (the other two being GET SHORTY and MEN IN BLACK).  It's along the lines of the previous two films that he's done, (more like MEN IN BLACK though).  But Sonnenfeld learned a lot from Danny DeVito and the Cohen Brothers when he was their cinematographer, how to make a fun and exciting film.  And he does succeed to the highest with this film.  Out of the summer movies, this is the topper (maybe only EYES WIDE SHUT can be better), you get what you are promised.  After you see the underrated STAR WARS, or if you haven't seen STAR WARS yet, GO SEE THIS FILM!!!!!! A highly entertaining movie, and one of the years best!***** (out of *****)",Wild Wild West
82,monkeysgalore,Believe the Negativity. There's a Reason No One Likes it.,2,5 August 2019,"Wild Wild West is a strange movie. The concept, the execution, everything about it is just so out there and not quite right. And people don't like it. It's considered to be almost universally bad, and many people would probably put it up there with ""Batman & Robin"" as one of the worst movies ever. I don't know if I'd go that far, but it's definitely bad (below average, hence my 2/10 rating). Here's why.It's just bad. That's the reason. It doesn't work, at any point during the runtime, and it never seems to find its way. I mean, the initial idea sounds so crazy that it's immediately compelling. Come on, a ""western sci-fi buddy action comedy""? How could that even work? Well obviously it can't. It's just an attempt to take everything smart and cool about Men in Black and exchange that for bad, lazy writing, and more special effects. The movie just coasts along on autopilot, indulging itself, and the plot moves weirdly, and things will just suddenly happen onscreen.The acting doesn't help either. Will Smith is the only person who doesn't make you cringe when he delivers his lines, but not even him or his charisma are enough to save the movie. Kevin Kline's lines are just hard to listen to, and he himself is often hard to watch, and the same can be said for Kenneth Branagh. Everything about the film is over the top. The acting, the special effects, the action sequences, and the comedy. The whole thing is just cartoonish and overdone, and it just seemed like it struggled to both pick a demographic and recapture what made Men in Black special, and it failed at both. Many of the jokes fall flat, either being too obvious or slapstick to be in an adult-aimed film, and others too inappropriate and seedy to be in a kids-aimed film. At the same time, it also tries to rehash what made Men in Black special (the buddy formula with crazy science fiction and action elements thrown in), and it's just not the same.Director Barry Sonnenfeld worked with what he had, and I guess this was the best that could have come from what he had to work with. He's mostly famous for doing the Men in Black movies, and his obvious style is apparent here. But the Men in Black films used their setting and crazy effects and let the actors work and be themselves within all that. Here, the actors are smothered in the CGI and story. Will Smith is barely even able to shine, although he manages to a few times. Sonnenfeld's big problem is that he didn't try to make this its own movie. It's supposed to be Wild Wild West, not Men in Black in Wild Wild West. He didn't make it its own thing. Another problem is that he was working with the legacy of an entire TV show. Unless someone had told me this was based on the original Wild Wild West show, I'd probably not've been able to tell, aside from the ""gadgets in the old west"" theme, and the title. Much like the I Spy movie with Owen Wilson and Eddie Murphy (also based on a show), this film pretty much disregards its predecessor and tries to work on its own. And unlike I Spy, this did not work.Aside from Sonnenfeld, we have four (yes, four) writers to thank for this mess. Because apparently something this nonsensical and bad was just too much for just one person to screw up. S.S. Wilson (Tremors), Brent Maddock (Tremors), and screenwriting duo Jeffery Price and Peter S. Seaman (Doc Hollywood, Who Framed Roger Rabbit?) all wrote the screenplay, and the story was crafted by Jim and John Thomas (Predator, Executive Decision). Jim and John have proven themselves before as writers with the aforementioned examples, however, the screenplay writers, who all essentially worked on all the same films, came up very short here. The plot was thin, bland, and uninteresting, the characters were one-dimensional, but at least Will Smith was able to make us care about his character by giving it his best shot and just being himself. Bland characters in a bland story make for a bland experience. And this wasn't helped by a barrage of cringeworthy and/or unnecessarily inappropriate jokes (for such a child-oriented film). All the humor was too obvious and over the top. The script never allowed the leads to just banter and argue, and the development of their relationship was forced the whole time, and there was nothing natural about it, unlike other, more competent entries in the buddy genre.It never seemed, at least to me, like there was a time in the story where things clicked and there was at least some believability. And usually, genre movies, or especially large hybrid genre films like this one, should fall into two categories.A. The story is told and executed well enough that no matter how far fetched or unbelievable things are, it works because it's just so interesting and cool.B. It knows it doesn't work and just rolls with it, but still manages to make the believable points believable, without dragging everything down into the unbelievability (if that makes sense).The film misfired on both fronts. It failed to properly acknowledge just how preposterous it is, and it tried too hard to make fun of itself at other times. And at the most outrageous moments, it barely stopped to poke fun or be meta, but instead tried to become realistic all of a sudden. I mean, seriously, when your big finale is a giant robot spider shooting fireballs at an old west town, you better be ready to make fun of yourself. But the film wasn't. Instead, it either tried too hard or too little to make fun of the semi-believable parts leading up to the finale, then treated the finale as if it were completely realistic. And even if something is far-fetched, it's always nice for there to be at least some reality. But not here. Here, the characters act irrationally and say weird things, have a small variety of emotions, and fit right in with the completely insane narrative. In no way is the film grounded in reality, and in no way does it even acknowledge it.This is an action comedy, and I guess on the action end, it did ok. There were some pretty entertaining fight scenes, and usually if the action is good, I'm ok, because it's a genre movie. But this is different. It's a hybrid of 5 different genres, and I was promised more than just some good action. But anyway, there were some cool moments, like the water tower fight, the saloon brawl, the office shooting scene where Will effortlessly kills several assassins, the train fight, and the final fight aboard the giant spider. Don't expect brutal or hard-hitting action though, the violence just plays out like every other aspect of the movie. However, there some surprisingly violent and out of place moments that greatly departed from the tone of the film, and made it even harder to understand it. For example, the massacre of the group of soldiers by the main villain, and the off-screen decapitation of a man in the beginning. Moments like that just confused me, and again I wondered, who was the target audience?Now, *sigh*...the comedy. It's bad. I don't even need both hands to count the times I chuckled. And the most painful moments went on forever. Mainly two instances where a main character was disguised as a woman. Yes, believe it or not, BOTH main characters are forced into cross dressing scenarios on separate occasions. And both scenes are immensely painful and hard to watch. Aside from that, there were lots of slapstick and stale moments where the script tried way too hard to be funny, and the actors tried even harder, and the result was one large face-palm. Maybe little kids will think it's funny. Or really desperate adults. Either way, I definitely recommend staying away from this if you want to laugh.
As for the other genre elements, wildly different genres like the western and sci-fi ones can be mixed well, but this one just didn't do it quite right. Everything seemed off, and the script almost didn't let the genres go together, despite that being the purpose. It was just so obvious that it was a movie the whole time, and I was never so engrossed that I wasn't aware I could leave, or that life was going on around me. And other movies have sucked me in like that before. But not here.Honestly, the best thing about this movie was the theme song Will Smith made (""Wild Wild West""). The song honestly deserved better than to be attached to this movie.All in all, stay away from this one. Unless you're a Will Smith fan, but even then, I recommend caution. There are some things not even the best actors can save.",Wild Wild West

87,MF210,Falls Flat in Too Many Areas,5,21 October 2003,"My Rating: ** out of ****. Wild Wild West is a movie that has some good things about it, but it is not a good movie. It lacks a decent script to satisfy the audience. We are set to rely on technology and the actors for this movie to be a success. Only one of them works.The technology part is actually quite good. The special effects are really impressive. The sets are also quite nice looking. However, this movie is mostly based on its success here and no where else. The acting is mostly a disappointment. Will Smith gives off some charm but it is also a bit uneven. He is an actor that has strength in comedic parts, however most of the most of the comedic parts dont work well. He looks kind of out of place in the fight scenes. Kevin Kline gives 3 performances, only one of them is any good. He is actually somewhat amusing as President Grant, but as a hooker and Artemus Gordon he is very flat. Salma Hayek is beautiful and has a great ass, but she is also flat. The only one really to give a solid performance is Kenneth Branagh, he is so over the top but he is so good as a villain.
The script is avery big weakness here. Theres a funny one liner that Smith says but other than that there is not much. The jokes are mostly flat. Especially the ""boob"" jokes. Overall, Wild Wild West is really unsuccessful but I dont feel that its horrbly bad. Its not good, its no better than mediocre but not terrible.",Wild Wild West

Good humour, nice characterisations that are well acted out and tight directing leave me with nothing to complain about. Well, maybe the story is a bit too far fetched but what the hell; I enjoyed it.I do have one moan though. What drongo was responsible for the trailer? Yet again (and this was also true of Men in Black) all the 'fx and a lot of the plot was given away by the advert.

The action scenes are done in a very boring way and the science fiction ""toys"" and ""gadgets"" are simply idiotic at some points.Even for an action adventure movie, the script is really bad and it uses really bad jokes that suppose to make us laugh only because they are coming from Will Smith's mouth.

Aside from the 'mechanology' nonsense and the plot(?), it's a lot of fun to watch. Will Smith is probably the main reason for this. Kenneth Branagh is able to rock a Seneca beard long before Seneca Crane could, and Salma Hayek looks amazing in whatever she's wearing. While Kevin Kline looked like a combination of Robert Downey Jr. and Bill Murray, he and Smith made decent partners.There are token characters aplenty though, which is a major downfall for the film. It might be offensive to pretty much everyone, but not in a way that painfully insults anyone. (Or at least it didn't offend me, a young Caucasian male.)

When it came out there was A LOT of hype for it and with the plot that this movie had there was no way that it could deliver.This is a good movie for between the ages of 12 and 15. I don't believe anyone over 15 would find the humor to be funny nor would they really be interested in the lame plot, where an early teen might not be so critical. The special effects and mechanical devices are also more geared towards a 12 to 15 year old as opposed to someone over that age mark. Saying the acting is nothing special might be a bit too generous. It all just was a bit too wacky for it to be taken seriously. It seemed like Will Smith and others were probably having a blast with this movie and not taking it like a serious project at all, and it definitely shows. There is nothing truly to hate about this film, but it is definitely sub par. If you're an early teen it might be worth a watch, but anyone older than that should definitely seek something else out instead.",Wild Wild West

In fact, I would say the cast was well thought out. It just wasn't executed well. While science did play a role in the old series, they seemed to be intent on playing up the special effects, and they didn't do a great job, except for Lovelace's wheelchair (the best effect of the movie) Kevin Kline has legs, obviously, and their vanishing was well done.Again, so much potential...

Totally ludicrous casting of Will Smith as James West- in real life it never would have happened. Kline is OK as a rather effeminate Artemis Gordon who spends one third his screen time wearing a dress.Branagh is totally wasted as Loveless, the legless industrialist who wants to take over the US.Other scenes just fall flat. Sonnenburg, a good comedic director pretty much misses all the marks here. What saves this movie is the pseudo Jules Verne like steam punk technology. There is a sinister riverboat that launches a tank that converts into an armored railroad car. There are steam powered bikes and wheelchairs. There is a flying machine, and, of course the steam powered tarantula.Truly an awesome piece, this 80 foot high steam spider devours everything in its path. Movie is worth seeing alone for this, but we have to wait too long to see it, and it is underused. Smith and Kline have decent chemistry together, but the movie itself is not very good.

Will Smith is James West, a slick gunslinger who, along with his partner (Kline) must prevent a political assassination and save a town from destruction.

100,wadechurton,They should use this in film school as a 'worst case scenario'.,2,19 October 2008,"Okay, here's my two cents. What it looks like is that somebody had the not-so-stupid idea of remaking the original 1960s James Bond/sci-fi/just plain weird 'Western' series into a big-budget movie. Then somebody else said 'Will Smith is interested!' and over the cliff we go. Cue a radical rewrite as a Will Smith 'comedy' vehicle. Smith looks great in a cowboy outfit, but as Jim West he sleepwalks through the movie, smug, self-absorbed and oddly detached from the rest of the cast. West is supposed to be best mates with sidekick Kevin Kline's Artemus Gordon character, but both men have all the chemistry of two strangers passing the time in idle conversation at a bus stop. Over-the-top villain Kenneth Branagh and his crew of female no-goods do strike the right chord, but they're not enough to save the movie. Selma Hayek is fine but woefully underutilized, and all players are at the mercy of an unfunny, ham-fisted and sometimes tedious script. Considering the rich possibilities offered by the original series' ideas, this dull, misguided movie is an outright heartbreak, along the lines of the similarly botched 'Avengers' train wreck. Hope they don't decide to remake 'The Prisoner' and then get a call from Will Smith's agent...",Wild Wild West

The movie is not Boyhood or Casablanca, but that you already knew before watching it. I personally find it much better than Men in Back (which sometimes I found a bit dark). My kids loved Wild Wild West and were very scared with Men in Black. Wild Wild West is funny and entertaining, and both Will Smith and Kevin Kline are superb in their roles. The jokes are funny and Will Smith looks super sexy. Kenneth Branagh is also great as a villain, although his accent continuously changes and that bothered me a bit. The worst was probably Salma Hayek: her role is completely superfluous and her acting is terrible. The music of the movie is great and the song performed by Will Smith is really cool. I probably would give it a 7, but because I got so angry at all these bad reviews, I give it a 10. It is very easy to criticize. The difficult thing is to create.

103,Danimal-7,Mediocre,5,24 August 1999,"I went to see this movie having little idea what to expect.  Having seen Will Smith brandishing a six-shooter on the poster and noting the word ""West"" in the title, I naively assumed that I was going to see a Western.WILD WILD WEST is not a Western.  It's more like an Edgar Rice Burroughs or Jules Verne fantasy, the ones where steam power technology was going to solve all the world's problems.  The story follows federal marshals Jim West (Will Smith) and Artemus Gordon (Kevin Kline) as they attempt to thwart a plot to blackmail the United States into total surrender by use of an eighty-foot fireball-shooting mechanical tarantula, built by an ex-Confederate scientist named Arliss Loveless (Kenneth Branagh) who is missing not only his legs but his entire lower body and who has a bevy of beautiful but evil females in his service.  I swear I am not making this up.WILD WILD WEST wants to be an action flick and a comedy flick also.  As action, it is utterly ludicrous, going far beyond all suspension of disbelief and generating no suspense or shock value.  As comedy, it is strictly hit-and-miss.  The infantile sexual innuendoes are extremely annoying and unfunny, and Sonnenfeld shows the same penchant for weak gross-out humor that marred his previous effort, the otherwise hilarious MEN IN BLACK.  But there are some inspired moments too: an outrageously weird scheme by West to free Gordon, a train pursuit that becomes a wacky slapstick scene, and a sequence that spoofs THE DEFIANT ONES.There's nothing wrong with the acting, but a lot of talent is wasted.  Will Smith is competent enough, but did better in INDEPENDENCE DAY (a film even more brain-dead than this one), in ENEMY OF THE STATE, and MEN IN BLACK. Kevin Kline is one of the most versatile actors in the business, and he proves it here, giving us a goofy but lovable intellectual and a second role as a hardened politician where he makes both his face and voice unrecognizable.  He is unconvincing playing a female role, but apparently he wasn't supposed to do a good job of it.  Kenneth Branagh, my favorite actor, is given a stupid comic-book villain role, and plays it that way; this movie squanders his abilities.  Salma Hayek's Rita Escobar is a completely superfluous character, having no purpose in this movie except to give us an embarrassing, unappealing and unamusing shot of her derriere.  More appealing to males with raging hormones is Ling Bai in a short appearance as the villainous Miss East.WILD WILD WEST is good for a few laughs and nothing else.  Fans of the actors will be disappointed.  MEN IN BLACK is by far the superior movie.Rating: ** out of ****.",Wild Wild West
104,ericjg623,"Weird, weird west",2,2 October 2002,"This movie has only two things going for it - Salma Hayek. OK, bad joke, but then, this whole film is one big, bad joke. Sometimes, when a movie combines several different genres, as with a great recipe combining different foods, we get much more than the sum of their parts. In this one, it's the exact opposite. It's like combining sushi, barbeque sauce, peanut butter, and broccoli in a blender. Each ingredient is just fine, but the combined result is simply horrible. That's what we get here - a combination Western, comedy, Jules Verne-esque sci-fi tale, and big budget effects spectacular that succeeds only in leaving a really bad taste in our mouths. The two ""heroes"", Will Smith and Kevin Kline, are, as partners, the antithesis of the ""Men in Black"" duo, in fact, they actually seem to have *negative* chemistry in that, when they're on screen together, they are far worse than each is alone. Kenneth Branaugh, no matter how hard he tries, cannot succeed at making his sawed off combination of Southern patriot/mad genius character seem anything but bizarre. The situations and accompanying dialog are rife with cringe moments, most notably a scene in which Smith and the chief villain fling cripple jokes and racial taunts at each other, which is soon followed by a scene involving Smith, a busty white woman, and then a lynch mob. It's supposed to be funny; it ends up being a huge embarrassment for everyone in it. I could go on, but suffice it to say that any movie in which the last half hour or so is spent fighting aboard a 50-foot high steam driven mechanical spider is one to run, not walk, away from as fast as you can. 2/10 and that's only because, if you fast forward past any scene that doesn't feature Salma Hayek, you'll get maybe 10 minutes of actual entertainment value.

105,Denver53,Bad screen play? Poor directing? Who gets the blame?,3,21 January 2000,"It would seem to be impossible to make a boring movie when your stars are Will Smith and Kevin Kline. I mean, what the charismatic Smith doesn't have in maturity the talented Kline more than makes up for in experience and timing (see ""A Fish Called Wanda""). But somehow, Wild Wild West is dull and leaves you wondering what went wrong.I suppose one reason the movie is bad is because it lacks atmosphere. You would think the title ""Wild Wild West"" would indicate a strong western (as in cowboys and desert) influence, but the only west here is either 1) supposed to be Jim West, who is about as shallow a character as they come, or b) the seemingly thrown-together cowboy outfits and occasional horses that are supposed to make us feel like this is a gosh darn real Western. Really, this movie is more about the North and South and the grudges left from the Civil war than about the East or West. Another downfall is poor pacing. I found myself looking at my watch to see how long the movie had been on the first time a point came up where I could see a possible conclusion close at hand. I did that 45 minutes into the 1 hour, 46 minute film. I did it three more times before the climax actually arrived. It seemed as if the movie was out of gas long before it was actually at the end.Finally, one sure fire sign of a bad movie is when characters get into promising situations early, then either engage in lame dialogue or lame responses to move the movie on to the next scene. In WWW, you only had to watch the first scene after the credits to get a sense of, ""uh-oh"" (the very first scene, of a man hunted by a flying metal disc, was actually intriguing). With rare exception, WWW offered lame conclusions to every situation. In fact, at one point there is supposed to be a huge explosion, but all we see is a little burst from the inside the building. We are supposed to imagine the rest. It feels like the movie's funding ran out and someone had to cut corners.Finally, Selma Hayak is awful. She is like a young Charro. There was no chemistry, and she adds little as the sort-of love interest.When it was all over, I could only muse at what might have been. This could have been a franchise for Will Smith. I wonder if he realized during the filming of the movie that the final product would be so poor, and, perhaps, cost him so much in the long run.",Wild Wild West

Both Will Smith and Kevin Kline produce the worst performances of their careers. I'm sure the original series didn't go as far in terms of technology as this movie did.

Both he and Kline don't seem to get a chance to cut loose and make the parts their own, and as a result their characters have zero chemistry together. Brannagh's villain is imaginative and well realised, but his dialogue is wretched, and Salma Hayek gets to do little more than stand or run around looking sexy in a procession of bosom-enhancing period costumes. OK, so no complaints there, but a little bit of character would have been nice.Still, the effects are good and there are certainly some unique scenes, unless you can think of another movie where an 80ft mechanical spider rampages through an old west town.

Not the absolute rock bottom worst, but given it's cast and the team who made it, I don't think it was out of line to have been expecting better than this. Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh are tremendous actors, but this material is beneath them. Selma Hayek is very charming, and I really liked ""Fools Rush In"" and some of her other work, but she was there for eye candy and there's no hiding that. Will Smith has never been a ""great actor"", but he just reads well. He's very attractive and likeable in general, and he is here, as well, but the writing was not good enough for the lead to get by on being attractive and likeable. Parts of it were entertaining and funny, and the crowd seemed to be having a good time. Truthfully, I did too.

112,ToldYaSo,A spectacle of special effects with a grand cast and weak premise,5,16 August 1999,"Despite the different setting, it would be difficult for anyone to not compare ""Men In Black"" to ""Wild Wild West"" when the star and director are the same. This film just demonstrates that even if you bring all the right people together, with a big budget and the great special effects, if it isn't a good script it isn't a good movie. The premise of this film is probably it's weakest point. Half an hour into the film you might be asking yourself, ""Just what the hell is going on anyway?Now the special effects artisans have not let us down in the creativity department. There's plenty of dazzling sequences that astonish the audience with gadgetry a plenty. But the special effects are almost too special, at least for the time period the film is set in.As I'm sure many will agree, ""Men In Black"" was a smash hit and a fine film that mixes equal parts comedy, special effects and science fiction. The outlandish elements of a film with an extraterrestrial background are easily swallowed with perfect suspension of disbelief. But if you tell the audience that it's the old west, then go easy on the 80 foot mechanical tarantulas if you please.Well, let's just pretend that I fell asleep for the part where it's explained that time travelers from the distant future settled in the old west and brought their advanced technology to the past. That still wouldn't quite do it. Something about the characters aren't all that intriguing either.Take Salma Hayek's ""Rita"" for example. I guess she's supposed to be a damsel in distress, but maybe she's more appropriately penned as a damsel inconvenienced. We don't really get a sense of what she's all about until the end of the picture. In one scene she panics and puts herself and our heros in jeopardy. When moments like that come up, it's difficult to comprehend why a character would do such a stupid thing. Let's not blame the character, after all, it's the writer who was in full control. My apologies to the writer if that particularly stupid scene wasn't in the script and rather made up on the fly, but I seriously doubt it.Will Smith's character ""West"" is a Government agent/gunslinger who quite matter-of-factly brings up the ""painful"" death of his family within a thirty second scene which feels too much like a ""and this is why he wants to kill the bad guy really really badly, and he'll deserve it too"" moment.Kevin Kline's character ""Artemus"" is a little more interesting, and of course, Kenneth Brannagh's ""Dr. Loveless"", being as evil and demented as he can be, but not too threatening. Again, if someone can simply explain how a person could possibly survive after being cut in half a hundred years ago, I'd happily overlook the elaborate steam engine wheelchair.Given all that, the film had it's moments, it's lines, it's eye candy (and I'm not necessarily always talking about the special effects) but over all quite a disappointment. I'm reluctant to focus on the negative of any film, but Barry should've found a way to incorporate the aliens again. I guess it's not too long before we go back to tried and true and see ""Men In Black 2"".",Wild Wild West

I cannot imagine there being a bigger waste of talent and money being put on film in the next few months.  All of the humor is trite and painfully forced. Kenneth Branaugh was great for what he had to work with and Kline has wasted his comic efforts recently with this and In and Out.  Will Smith mugs his way through this debacle and basically reprises his Men In Black/ID4/Fresh Prince acting ability which was great when he had something funny to say. Salma Hayek is going to have to do more than show her butt to become a star. But even the greatest acting in the world couldn't have saved this mess.

The music videos, commercials and appearances on Oprah gave the impression that this was going to be a real blast to watch. Unfortunately, this isn't the case. Will Smith couldn't pull this one off and what resulted was a rather boring movie. The special effects were interesting and made the movie somewhat bearable but the story line was less than adequate. At various points I almost decided to leave. In fact, the couple sitting beside me lasted approximately 30 minutes before they decided to go.Watching this movie, I couldn't help but feel a lack of chemistry between Smith and Kline. Although they work somewhat amicably together, they lacked the chemistry necessary to make the movie fun. Hayek's character was insignificant and made me think that her role in this movie was to be nothing more than eye candy.They story/plot line slowed down at points causing the audience to lose interest and the ending scene seemed hurried or incomplete. Some of the humor generated a chuckle out of me but nothing more. The audience was very quiet for a Will Smith movie and I think this had more to do with poor writing than Smith and Kline's inability to pull of the lines.

115,Yonhap S,"fine, fine, fine",6,18 August 1999,"I saw WWW last night too. It wasn't so bad. There were times people laughed at the jokes but on 20% of them. It's sure not one of Smith's best movies but it's still good passing entertainment. There are some lame scenes though like West in a exotic dancer costume, it's just out of place. It may be a quirky series but this is too much. Also there's not much of Salma Hayek, her brief appearance in From Dusk Til Dawn maybe okay, but the mystique would be gone in another movie. So, add the revelation of Mr. Escobar as a bad idea (he doesn't look too old after all). After reading on Kevin Smith's descriptions of his dealings with Jon Peters, I wonder how much of this movie was hurt due to his dumb whimsies. The good parts include the art direction and the gadgets. I liked the attempt for a Jules Vern-ian direction. The Air Gordon was nifty in that it was extrapolated from Da Vinci's designs. The auto-buckle in Gordon's train doesn't cut it for me. The mechanical spider is a lame Peters idea. It's a incredible design but I can't really fathom how it will destroy the United States. Certainly there's no weapon to match it, but it has to stop sometime. Never mind how Loveless managed to gather the resource to build such a thing. Smith and Kline's interaction is okay.

119,Junker-2,"I wish they hadn't called it ""Wild Wild West""",3,11 January 2000,"I have a question for all of the people involved in the making of this movie. Did you spend any time at all watching the old TV series? Did you spend any time trying to figure out what made the old show popular? Or did you spend all your pre-production time thinking up all the cool special effects you could use??!!I was a fan of the old TV show. I like Will Smith. I like Kevin Kline. I like Salma Hayek. Obviously, I expected to like this movie.I did not like this movie.Perhaps all my complaints can be summed up with my criticism of Will Smith in the lead. He does NOT play James West. He plays Will Smith. He plays the same character he played in ""Men in Black"" and ""Independence Day."" Not one person involved in the mess, in fact, seemed to care one bit about the original TV series. Well, if you don't like the old TV series, why try to make a movie out of it?Go figure.",Wild Wild West
120,daustin,Woof!!,3,30 June 1999,"This movie is a dog. I saw it at a free preview and I wanted to demand my time back. Well it's not that awful but it sure isn't good. I don't think anyone even bothered to try to make this a good movie. Great actors with nothing to do, they must have been pretty disappointed when they realized this was no Men in Black. I didn't expect a good plot, but I did expect to at least have fun. Don't waste your money.",Wild Wild West

The acting was great and some of the action was enjoyable alsoBad parts: The story is boring as hell and also most of the movie was just so cheesy that it made me sick. I fell asleep half way through it first time watching it, second time i actually managed to stay awake only because i wanted to see if the movie was worth at least an eight...i was wrong it got lower...will you normally impress me with your acting, but this no...Just...just no5/10",Wild Wild West
122,spinbunny,Could have been better,6,30 June 1999,"This move was a show case for Will Smith who is charismatic beyond belief.Otherwise, a lot of over-acting, bad acting and there should have been a lot more laughs. (the inside jokes were the best laughs, though....Air Gordon anyone?)",Wild Wild West
123,Time Tripper,It's time to retire this genre.,4,5 January 2001,"Movie producers (I refuse to give them the dignity of being called ""filmmakers"") who really think that movies based on old TV shows will work might want to reevaluate not only that conclusion, but their career choice. Now, I liked the ""Brady Bunch"" movie because it was a parody of a really bad TV show.  ""Lost In Space,"" for all its many, many flaws, was also better than the TV show it was based on.  ""Mission Impossible"" wasn't a great film, but it did work as an action movie.  ""Star Trek"" and ""Naked Gun"" had the advantage of just being continuations of shows that were unfairly cancelled. ""Charlie's Angels"" was also a parody, and it was very entertaining.  Those are the only TV show-movies worth mentioning.  ""Wild Wild West"" might be a parody, but it travels so far from its source material, that any resemblance is lost on an audience that probably never saw the show anyways.  This movie certainly won't create any new fans of the show.  Come to think of it, I seriously doubt anyone involved in the production of ""Wild Wild West"" the movie ever saw the show either. 
""Wild Wild West"" is an awkward, odd, and pointless movie.  It does not rise to the level of badness occupied by the movie ""Batman and Robin,"" but it seems like it's trying to.  I won't bore you with the exact details about the plot.  This movie is pure formula: smart-alec cop #1 (in this case they're federal agents) meets more serious cop #2, they don't get along but their forced to work together to find the bad guy they're both chasing.  And a girl gets involved.  Unoriginality is not an unforgivable sin in a movie. If it were, then James Bond would be out of a job.  This movie fails because it's just really awkward.  It degenerates into race and handicap jokes that no self-respecting person would laugh at, and keeps bouncing back and forth between wanting to be serious and wanting to be funny.  (Contrast the carnage of one of the scenes involving the villain's super-tank with the goofiness of the preceding and following scenes.)The suspension of disbelief necessary to enjoy action movies is stretched beyond the audience's ability to rationalize.  It suffers from Reed Richards' Syndrome (named after the master-inventor leader of Marvel Comics' ""Fantastic Four"", who has built everything from time machines to faster-than-light space ships).  The weird inventions in this movie are both (a) impossible and (b) revolutionary.  If people really had these gadgets then the world would be revolutionized by them.  A flying machine in 1869? Gordon's rocket-cycle?  (Let's not talk about the giant spider!)  I know this movie is NOT SUPPOSED TO BE historically accurate, but COME ON!  This movie makes ""Gladiator"" look like a History Channel documentary.I really feel sorry for anyone who paid to see this movie.  And the next time you go to see a movie based on an old TV show, make sure it's free.",Wild Wild West
124,slimshady5623,I thought this movie was good.,7,2 June 2012,I remember enjoying this movie when I first saw it in theaters back in the summer of 1999 I was only 8 years old at time. I'm going to get to my likes and dislikes about this film: My likes: I liked how this movie was action packed the fight's were nicely done although most of the action in this movie is done by will smith not kevin kline. I liked the cast I thought most of the actors did a good job. I liked the special effects they were impressive I mean for a movie that came out in 1999 I was impressed.My dislikes: I thought the chemistry between kevin kline and will smith wasn't too believable. I though kevin kline was pretty dull hes a good actor but I was expecting much more.,Wild Wild West
125,LT-10,The Worst Yet This Year,1,24 July 1999,"One word: BAD. This movie was so flat and so fake I just looked at the theatre wall in some parts.

RUN RUN RUN!!!!!!!!!",Wild Wild West
126,captnemo,For this I waited 30 Years?,3,7 September 2000,"Let's face it, that movie was one of the biggest disappointments of the 90s. As bad as the Avengers. I am a BIG fan of the series. The series wasn't perfect, but it set up its own little universe where anything was possible and I went with it. All of that was chucked in the film. There are so many things wrong that I'd be here all day listing them, but here goes. 1] The casting was fatally flawed. Smith was his usual smart-mouth jerk self. He was as out of place here as popeye would be in Empire Strikes Back (but not Phantom, but that's another topic). Kline almost had his character down, but I could never see him becoming friends with smith-jerk. No chemistry was evident between them, and that's a major problem. This is my big beef with this film. Smith is so wrong for this film that I was never in the story. He's the weakest link in all the films he appears in, mostly due to his attitude. I'd like it if he just went away. His character here would have been killed on the spot the moment he opened his foul mouth. No one acted like he does until the late 20th century, and the world is not better off because of it. Rosie o'donell would make a better James Bond. 2] Story- It's obvious that the crew had never watched more than a single episode of the series. Very few of the basics were done right, and they were mis-used. Artemus is a master of disguise, but never in women's clothes. This is some cross-dressing writer's nightmare. The train was excellent, but the leads acted as if they'd used it for years instead of their first trip on it. Kline and smith just seem to plod along, always bickering, until they trip over Loveless and his scheme. No where is there any hint of intelligent research or fact gathering. Robert Conrad said it best-""This film was made by an ex-hairdresser and a ex-set designer, and it shows. Maybe they would be better off in their former jobs."" No talent is on show here, except for the CGI crew, sets and Elmer Bernstein's music. An incredible waste of time and money. On top of all that, they destroyed the town built for the movie ""Silverado."" This will be forgotten about soon, while the series will live on forever. Rating: 4 out of 10.",Wild Wild West
127,hmsgroop,Cruel and Violent,1,14 May 2000,"Buying this film I had in mind The Great Race and I expected to see a funny comedy with modern effects and intricate gadgets. Unfortunately the film crew failed to shoot a comedy but shot an implausible story that could hardly have taken place in the American West. It seems to me that people of the 19th century had more respect towards the President than our contemporaries. Anyway, the genre of the film is said to be comedy but the film is anything but funny. It's full of unnecessary violence and cruelty. It's hard to say what IS funny in it. The Great Race could boast a hero and a villain but whatever tricks they played on each other they never resulted in severe damage, if the worst came to the worst they threw cakes at each other or fell sprawling in the mud. Nevertheless, the vice was punished and laughed at. It was not frightening , it was ridiculous. That's why one could safely show such films as The Great Race to children; I for one saw it first when I was 5 or 6 and I still enjoy it. Maybe films of the kind should be shot in this humorous vein. I myself do not mind my p's and q's and can appreciate a thriller or an action film with all the gore and blood if the violence is justified, but Wild Wild West is not the case.",Wild Wild West
128,mick987g,Still think that Matthew McConaughey,1,19 September 2006,"I still think that Matthew McConaughey and Oliver Platt would have been a better choice as James West and Artemus Gordon.And the screen play could have used a little tweaking , maybe by taking some input from Conrad and maybe some of the fans who know the show inside and out.I just look at this movie as a spoof of a good movie.Kline made Artemus too effeminate. The only good point of this movie was Salma Hayek . I hope that someone would like to make this movie over again with a better script and actorsBut hey this is me",Wild Wild West
129,daved-3,Loveless? Try lifeless,2,12 September 1999,"Have you heard Wild Wild West is bad?  Believe me, whatever you heard, it's actually worse!  Wild Wild West is a lifeless lump of a movie bearing only a superficial relationship to the classic 60's TV series.  The blame can't be laid at the feet of the actors, as Will Smith, Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branaugh are certainly game enough (although Kline as President Grant is embarrassingly bad casting).  The blame has to go to the half dozen hacks responsible for the screenplay and director Barry Sonnenfeld.  The casting of Will Smith would not have been a problem if they had just ignored the race issue entirely and presented it as color-blind casting (the series frequently featured blacks in prominent roles that were probably not available to blacks in post Civil War America), but the script makes the mistake of trying to make it plausible that someone of Will Smith's color could be a close confidant and advisor of the President.  And Sonnenfeld brings none of the warped perspective that worked so well in MIB and the Addams Family films to this material.  At this point we must re-examine his career and decide if he is a talentless schmuck who's been lucky before this, or a gifted director who had a lobotomy right before filming began.  Since Sonnenfeld made a big deal about how the bad buzz about the film before its release was wrong, I guess he still believes it's an Oscar contender no matter what anyone says.	One of the worst things about the film is the score; it was actually a relief when Smith's ubiquitous rap version came up over the closing credits.  Elmer Bernstein's bombastic music is from some far grander film, perhaps a sequel to Lawrence of Arabia.  It had none of the flair of the anachronistic jazzy score from the series.  The makers of the film seemed embarrassed by the source material and sought to distance themselves from it, leaving them without any concept to hang their hats on.  Fortunately reruns of the original are still on TNT and can be watched by people who want to see something resembling entertainment.    When people without talent make a bad film, at least it's occasionally amusing; when talented people make a mess like this, it's a waste of $180 million.  How many Blair Witch Projects could be made with that kind of money?",Wild Wild West

135,Swampfox,SONNENFELD AND SMITH BOTH FIND SECOND TIME NO CHARM,3,2 July 1999,"The lucky streak that has seen both Barry Sonnenfeld and Will Smith hit box office gold for their last several movies apart (""Addams Family Values""/""Get Shorty"" & ""ID4""/""Enemy of the State"" - respectively) and one together (""Men in Black"") comes to a scene chewing, badly scored and just plain dull end the Fourth of July, 1999. It's a shame that so many people are going to endure this train wreck of movie because ""Wild Wild West's"" the only thing out there for two weekends, but that's what Warner Brothers was counting on. Dr. Loveless would envy the evil genius of the modern distribution pattern where audiences are herded in like cattle the first two weeks with the dinner bell of slick marketing, therefore ensuring huge returns before word of mouth gets out. Lucky timing also helps. With no other big popcorn movies out this entire summer besides the not quite overwhelming ""Star Wars: Episode I,"" ""West"" will benefit from the same scenario that helped ""Men in Black"" - which rode a big wave of disappointment with ""The Lost World"" - to box office manna.From the opening notes of the entirely new score, this ""West"" makes one misstep after another. Gone is the familiar ba-bum, ba-bum, ba-bum bum bum be-bum bum bum, replaced with a theme that defies an audience to try humming it when leaving the theater. Gone too is the animation/freeze frame device that separated the sequence breaks. Granted this device took advantage of television's required commercial breaks, yet it also helped tweak the suspense by making each episode into a mini-serial. There's an attempt at some sort of half-assed homage in the opening credits, but high contrast monochrome images with blueprint schematics aren't the same thing.In short, if you liked the series stay far away from this not-even-trying-to-be update. Yet, I'm no purist about these things. I like Will Smith and as much as I thought casting him as James West was the worst type of stunt casting I was expecting to be taken in by his affable charm again. Especially as I thought Kevin Kline was a good choice for Artemus Gordon (not great). There just isn't any chemistry between the two. The old series was a lot better, ironically, because the play between West and Gordon drove the show. The irony lies in the fact that Robert Conrad was THE star of the show but the late Ross Martin always more of a partner than a sidekick. There's more zip between West and the badly accented Kenneth Branagh playing the now legless Dr. Arliss Loveless (the original was a dwarf using his brain to get back at the Western culture that esteemed physical strength), even though the trading of racist jokes (Loveless) for cripple ones (West) is never witty - much less funny. More could have been made of these antagonists who find themselves trying to either destroy or save a white society that excludes them.For an action comedy that tries repeatedly for both targets, its aim could use that other James (Bond)  behind the trigger. Not only does ""WWW"" fail to thrill us, it never seems to make us laugh either. The only time I laughed out loud (and it didn't exactly bring the house down) was when West is described as a man who ""Shoots first, shoots later, shoots some more and when everyone's dead, THEN asks questions."" This is surprising considering that all of Sonnenfeld's films to date have been marked by sly, quirky humor. Although, it must be pointed out, the other films also had strong stories and characters that the humor was servicing, not vice versa. Like good icing on a better cake. In the end we could blame the writers, two of whom gave us  the very enjoyable action comedy ""Tremors"" incidentally also set in the dusty west.But it wasn't their names that got this hodge podge green lit at $150 million plus. You get the feeling that yet again a better script and approach was chucked once the two 800 pound gorillas got involved with their ""proven track records"" to guide all decisions.  It has been reported that Will Smith has said of missing out on Neo in ""The Matrix"" that it will become the role he will always regret letting get away. Seeing as the directors apparently said ""No thanks"" when it became apparent Smith would insist on injecting his ""trademarked humor"" (whatever that is) into the role, we can only be that much happier he was allowed to only ruin one film this year. And Sonnenfeld has been interviewed saying he blames not being able to preview it more to fine tune the humor.For anyone still naive enough to think that the powers-that-be care more about giving them a good time for their $8 versus making the payment on their new Idaho digs, I'd like to point out a favorite pet-peeve of mine: throwing pop tunes over the end credits just to nakedly sell cds.  Unlike the tracks used prominently in ""The Matrix"" - listen to  Propellerheads' ""Spybreak (short one)"" and you instantly recall the showstopping lobby shoot-out - that make up ""Matrix's"" first soundtrack (there's a separate one for the score), none in ""WWW"" show up until the end. With the artists involved featured prominently on TV and print ads, you're supposed to think whenever Smith goes into action something by Enrique Iglesias would kick in. ""No, you stupid cows in the audience we want to sell you meaningless tie-ins,"" the exec's can almost be heard saying.  This suggests the work of the one other person who probably has as much to do with the ""Wild Wild Waste"" as the director and star - producer Jon Peters. The former hairdresser again pops up involved with a film that should have been much better, like the Batman franchise. But, that's another rant....",Wild Wild West

Much seems to be by comparison to the original TV series. Why? The TV series wasn't all that great either, and yes, I watched it and enjoyed it regularly. It certainly was no less believable than this movie, especially those episodes featuring the late, great Michael Dunn as the original Dr. Lovelace. Lighten up folks, the TV series was at its best when it didn't take itself too seriously. This is just escapist entertainment. Will Smith and Kevin Klein turned in good performances. For me, Kenneth Brannagh really stole the show.",Wild Wild West
138,spirit11,Don't Expect a TV Show Remake,5,5 September 2000,"If you expect ""Wild, Wild West"" to be a remake of the 60s TV show, you'll be disappointed. If you expected to see some great special effects, you'll probably be disappointed there as well. If you expect a great storyline, well, you'll probably be disappointed.However, if you can let go of all your preconceptions and just go along for a silly little romp, then I've seen many movies much worse than this one! The movie has definitely been made with tongue firmly planted in cheek, and if you can accept that, then you won't walk out thinking you've wasted your time in watching.Will Smith and Kevin Kline obviously were having fun with this comedy, and the writers were over-the-top in taking the characters from the TV Show and moving them to the extremes. Easiest to see in this vein are their ""aversions"" to each others ideas. The Jim West (Smith) character in the TV show always used the little tools and tricks that Artemis Gordon (Kline) designed. Likewise, Gordon wasn't afraid to use a gun in the series. By making them caricatures of caricatures, the story line becomes just plain silly.My biggest complaint though is with the special effects. With all due respect just because you can create something on a computer doesn't mean you should! Backgrounds and other tricks looked silly. The stock shots (I'm guessing they were stock) of monument valley were wonderful, the blue screen backgrounds of the desert paled by comparison. Sometimes less is more, and I think the movie could have done much more with a lot less computer-generated effects.The one exception to this rule -- Kenneth Branagh's makeup was amazing. Equally impressive was his accent. I never would have known he was the actor without reading the credits.Adults might enjoy this movie for a laugh, and kids will generally enjoy the effects. There is a great deal of violence, some of it disgusting (a decapitated head), and a bit of sophomoric humor concerning women's breasts, plus a great deal of sexual innuendo. Will Smith also gets a free shot of his naked backside. Language is kept to a minimum. All this combines to explain the PG-13 rating.",Wild Wild West
139,Soujiro,"Painfully Awkward, Predictable, and Horribly Written",1,2 July 1999,"I actually walked out of the movie before it was over, and I suspect that audiences everywhere will experience a similar impulse. The movie (I dare not write its name) is another one of the countless pictures that must have been written by some kind of experimental Hollywood software. It takes several excellent actors, one wonderful special effects marvel, shakes them up and out pops the same crap every time.First of all, the trailers seem to imply that the setting is some kind of alternate futuristic Wild West. However, the writers decided to cram their horribly written plot into actual American history which is insulting and ridiculous. I liked Kenneth Branagh as the legless southern villain, Kevin Kline was adequate, and as usual Will Smith displayed the remarkable ability to play himself. The music in the film is traditional TV western fare which is bland and inappropriate. This movie desperately tries not to offend any age group or race, and ends up appealing to no one.Upon exiting the theater in disgust I had the familiar thoughts, ""I can't believe someone was PAID to write that, I can't believe I PAID to see that."" Although I have had similar thoughts quite frequently over the last few years, this incidence was by far one of the most intense episodes. Watch Tarzan again instead.",Wild Wild West
140,ackthpt,Mild Mild Waste,3,14 October 2008,"The moment I heard Will Smith was cast for the roll of James West I began to have my doubts. Will Smith has proved to be a fine actor in some recent roles, but at the time of this film he was still The Fresh Prince and that image was hard to shake. It was also hard to reconcile as an agent in 19th century America. It was like the 1980's had somehow merged with the late 1800's and produced something mutant.I found the humour, plot and acting uninteresting. It says something when you feel after 30 minutes you're money and time could have been spent elsewhere. The inside jokes and re-imagining did nothing to help matters. I'm in no hurry to see this again, though as a fan of the original television show I'd love to see someone take a more serious whack at this in a few years. More dramatic, darker, but with the occasional wit faithful to the TV show.",Wild Wild West
141,mhthehammer,An expensive mess,3,28 May 2020,"Based on the hit 1960's TV show of the same name, Wild Wild West centers on outlaw James West (Will Smith) and the master of disguise and inventor Artemus Gordon (Kevin Kline) and their plot to defeat the evil Dr. Arliss Loveless (Kenneth Branagh) from killing civilians and reviving the territories in the United States. Despite Will Smith's best attempt to save this movie, the elaborate set and costume designs, and it's overly expensive budget, Wild Wild West is a chaotic mess. The main problem with the picture is its unsteady tone, with several scenes mentioning dark and violent imagery and others with goofy and silly Yo Mama jokes and lame sexual innuendos. Also, while the TV show did combine elements of Western and science fiction, the movie sets course for the steampunk route, which also fell out of place with the Men in Black style humor. As for the jokes, they either drag for way too long or end with the most predictable payoff. Most notably, after West is introduced to Gordon dressed in drag, he encounters Gordon again dressed as President Grant, and finally, he meets a lady at the masquerade ball, mistaking her for Gordon. On top of the lame payoff from the rule of threes, the fact that you see Kline in drag or wearing a fake beard and prosthetic nose instead of another actor ruins the joke of a disguise. Finally, Rita Escobar (Salma Hayek), the brothel dancer who's searching for her scientist father, was probably the most useless character in the movie. Not only does the Mexican love interest have no chemistry between the two, contribute nothing, and accidentally get the heroes captured, but she was already married, making the love triangle pointless. Wild Wild West was under development hell throughout the 90's and it really shows, by its messy storyline, uneven tone and unfunny jokes that even Will Smith cannot save.

And by the way, this is supposed to be funny, right? Well none of the things I can find in this movie are funny. Its just so boring. I had a hard time sitting through this movie, so when it had ended, I could almost hold a party and celebrate its end with a party bigger than the fanciest meet and greet party after an Iron Maiden concert. It ain't enough with Will Smiths quick and catchy phrases. It ain't enough with such a great actor as Kenneth Branagh. It ain't enough with anything.

144,Terry-32,Great big fun!,10,6 July 1999,"First off, understand that anyone who hates this movie is mean and can't have fun. There is nothing wrong with something that's popular. I don't like hearing about how people make careers out of making fun of things that other people like whether it's Will Smith, Ricky Martin, or some other band or movie that a large group of people like. ""Wild Wild West"" is a fun movie. It has everything an outgoing person could want, action, comedy, great cotumes, sets, special effects, and a good story. The original Jim West was white, but the movie pulled off having a black Jim West. They also put an interesting story behind him since black people weren't respected by stupid white people back in the 1800's. I happen to be a big fan of Will Smith, so of course he was just as great in this movie as he was in ""Independance Day,"" ""Men in Black,"" or ""Bad Boys."" Kevin Kline as Artemus Gordon was equally good. He was really funny. He and Smith made a great duo. They had great one liners together. I was mad that I was mad that I and a few other people were the only people laughing in the theater full of leeches. I really have to give credit to Kenneth Branaugh for his performance as Dr. Arliss Loveless. I knew him as a serious actor, and this is the first comical thing he's done. He's the third best villain of this year next to Darth Maul in ""The Phantom Menace,"" and Agent Smith in ""The Matrix."" The scenes of action were exiting.I wish there were more shootouts, but John Woo didn't direct this.

It was worth it.",Wild Wild West
145,NxNWRocks,Muddled Mismash,3,4 July 2007,"If ""Wild Wild West"" has any ultimate value as a movie, it may be by showing that star power, action sequences and a lavish effects budget won't automatically form a great movie unless there is careful thought and planning put into the production. The first ten minutes are particularly choppy, to the point of discouraging further watching. It does then settle down to be barely passable and watchable, but it cannot escape the fundamental and multiple flaws inherent in the production, and should leave the average viewer with the sense of having wasted their time. On the plus side there are a couple of nice little touches here and there, Will Smith is generally as smooth as ever and not all of the jokes fall flat, but mostly it's a muddled effort.Firstly, the movie never settles on a consistent tone. Is it a comedy, or an action movie? Or is it a western with sci-fi aspects? It is actually a hodgepodge of all of these elements, and with due diligence and a stronger script it may well have been a success at spanning so many thematic parts. In reality the struggle for tone is exacerbated by confusion as to which audience it is intended for. It's a little too smutty for kids, and a little too clean-cut for adults. For those who like action in their action movies, there are certainly many sequences, not all of which are particularly well-choreographed, but there are also lengthy passages where not much action takes place at all.The plot, of course, is as far-fetched as can be, which can be overlooked as it's almost the least of the film's problems. Smith brings modern-day smarts and sensibilities to his character, which comes off as a little disorientating in a film set in the 1860s. Kline's performance is nothing to write home about, but he does his best with the mundane role he has been given here. Hayek is completely wasted as the female object of desire who is strictly along for the ride. However, far and away it's the gross miscasting of Kenneth Brannagh as the supervillian that really sticks out like a sore thumb. In one particular scene between Smith and Brannagh comes the film's biggest transgression  a series of racial and disability-based insults for which there cannot be any artistic defense in what should be a basic, harmless action movie. While the film is set in turbulent times just after the Civil War, it seems the film-makers felt they had to make a point of playing up the racial aspects, and disparaging comments are made about whites and blacks throughout the film. It's actually quite bizarre to imagine how anyone thought this was a good idea as it detracts sharply from the movie and should be a big discouragement to anyone thinking of letting children watch it.",Wild Wild West

Not only is it unfunny and annoying, but it accomplishes the incredible feats of making Will Smith unlikeable and making Kevin Kline seem boring.  And besides that, it has something to offend just about everyone -- there are sexist jokes (LOTS of them), homophobic jokes, and jokes about the handicapped, for starters. There's also a scene where Jim West (Smith) barely escapes being hanged by Southern rednecks, played clumsily for laughs.  This scene really made me uncomfortable -- if you're going to milk humor out of a black man being lynched, at least give it some kind of twist.  Almost everything in the movie feels uninspired, like all involved were just going through the motions.  Salma Hayek is no more than decoration.  Kenneth Branagh is entertaining in a couple of scenes;  at least he tries awfully hard.  The giant mechanical spider is pretty neat, and one of Branagh's henchman, a metal man, should have been in the movie more.  This heavy-handed mess doesn't hold a candle to ""Men in Black,"" and ""The Mummy"" remains the action movie to see so far this summer.",Wild Wild West

I agree that some of the actors could have been better cast (Will Smith included), but I have to admit that I enjoyed this film. It's simply not as bad as everyone makes it out to be.

I'd be willing to bet that at least half of racist terminology used by Branagh was historically inaccurate, but that's neither here nor there, it was simply unnecessary.Sonnenfeld had the opportunity and certainly the talent(both his own and that of his cast) to make a classic western/spy/action/comedy, instead he just made a $170 million pile of poop.On a positive note, I liked the giant spider machine and the wheelchair F/X.2/10 or 1/2*(out of 4)",Wild Wild West

I found it a pleasant afternoon's entertainment, and liked the fact that it never took itself (or the laws of physics) seriously.

163,VenomX,The poster boy for Hollywood marketing gone wrong.,3,4 January 2004,"Every summer Hollywood studios release their big 100+ million dollar movies with 50M marketing budgets attached.  Pretty soon we are subjected to fast food tie-ins, massive billboards along freeways, magazine covers, TV specials and basically anything else that the studio can think of to convince us to watch their film.  To be honest, I always thought of their marketing as an insurance policy by the studio as opposed to building hype for a big project.  When a film costs 170M you want to make damn well sure the bills get paid and the studio doesn't deny you future projects, (plus, the studio wants to make sure they make a good profit off of the film). It's a sad fact in Hollywood when films only get made for that one goal: to make money and to do whatever it takes to make sure that gets done.Wild Wild West is a big-budget movie that a degree of hype that was only overshadowed by Phantom Menace during it's summer of  release, basically that means that besides a Star Wars film it was the most hyped film of that summer.  I recall seeing trailers for this film in front of TPM and quite frankly I didn't think much of it.  That's to say I wasn't intrigued into seeing it nor did I refer to it as a ""flop in the making"" when I would talk about it in future conversations.  Naturally, when the film faded out of memory of the press and whimpered out of the box office only to be quietly released on video, I had to see this one to see what went wrong.One of the oldest arguments I've heard is that ""summer films are supposed to be unrealistic and are supposed to be fake"", this argument should only be used in certain cases.  It should only be used when small nitpicks are made such as me saying ""in scene 124 I noticed a small discrepancy in the backgrounds used for shot #121"", but when a 80 foot tall steam-powered tarantula walks across the desert shooting fireballs in local towns...then the argument gains meaning.  This movie tries hard to re-create the Wild West, considering the amount of effort they went into making costumes, sets and showing little details to re-create the atmosphere, (such as showing the construction of the Capitol building).  Ironically, it seems the filmmakers at the same time figured that they shouldn't follow history and are basically free to do whatever they want, so ""unleash the tarantulas and the henchmen with armour-played scalps"" the producers probably said the first day of filming.Wild Wild West tries, it really does, it has the star power of Will Smith and the acting abilities of Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh.  It has the CGI which I must say looks impressive for what it does, it has the action, it has the atmosphere executed rather well like I've stated before.  What went wrong?The script was terrible and no attention was paid to keeping anything believable or intact with poor pacing dragging everything down.  Will Smith's style of humour and acting does not belong in a film about the wild west, nor does Kevin Kline's abilities deserve to be wasted trying to be a foil to Will Smith's acting or a prostitute, don't even get me started on Branagh's accent which borderlines on stereotypical and just plain annoying. The film tries to institute gadgets into the plot as well, none of which are particular clever and most are just trying to look ""good"" in a 19th century setting, (such as using a man's head for photographic evidence, sounds marginally clever but just looks ridiculous in practise.  Then there are the scenes intended for comedy, such as the lynching scene where Will Smith tries to explain his actions and the word ""redneck"" which just plain falls flat as it tries to use out-dated 19th century stereotypes for comedic purposes, (such as using examples of drumming in Africa and Smith's alleged ""roots"" there).It's not a horrible film, and I'm still a little hesitant it won Worst Picture and is now in the ranks of Battlefield Earth & Showgirls in badness according to the Razzies.  It's more of an overly ambitious summer film that tries too hard and as a result all of it's flaws are brought into a larger focus.  It really isn't as bad as watching Travolta play a Klingon rip-off or watching Elizabeth Berkley trying to act.4.0/10",Wild Wild West

Will Smith does a fine job portraying Jim West and you hardly realize that he is an African-American playing a Caucasian role. While Smith is always fun to watch, he is still hard to believe as an action hero and his jokes are rarely anything more than cute. Kevin Kline is a truly gifted actor who is too good to play second fiddle to Smith and expresses this every time they are together. Kenneth Branagh plays a good villain, but his jokes are also very lame. Any attractive female could play Salma Hayek's role and she doesn't stand a chance at being noticed in this film. The Story is fun and believable, except for Smith's intrusion into Branagh's hideout as an African belly dancer. The real strength of the movie lies with the cool contraptions and gadgets that appear everywhere. The supporting characters are also very cool (General Bloodbath McGrath and Pres. Ulysses S. Grant) are very well played. Overall, it wasn't a disapointment, but not much better than Independence Day or Men In Black (Smith's other summer blockbusters).

Everybody tried so very hard, but to no avail.  The script just was too muddled and clumsy.In particular, I'm remembering a scene in which Smith and Brannagh, as hero and villain, are exchanging rejoinders.  The lines are meant to be witty, but they're not.  They're meant to be cutting, but they're not.  They're meant to be enjoyable ... and they almost are, due to the talent of the two actors.  They're trying their best, you can tell, to take those stupid lines and make them convincing (in much the same way that Gene Hackman did with his part in ""Superman IV""), but even these actors aren't up to the Herculean labor this entails.And poor Kevin Kline!  He just seems to have a knack for finding films that waste his talent; worse, make him look like a bad actor.  Anybody remember ""In and Out"", that homophobic movie that felt like a two hour ""knock-knock"" joke?  The man is talented; we all know that.  Look at ""A Fish Called Wanda"".  ""The January Man"".

Why make changes to the original formular? James West (Robert Conrad) and Artemus Gordon (the legendary Ross Martin) played Secret Service agents in the 1870's who took their orders from President U.S. Grant. In the plot lines, they worked cases connected to the real jurisdiction of the Secret Service in the last century, like protection of the President and investigating crimes against the government (remember, those who the days before the FBI and the CIA). The anachronistic gadgets and dialog made the show unforgettable.The movie, however, is terrible. How can you cast an African-American (Will Smith) as a government agent in the 1870's? Very hip and cool for the 1990's, but really stupid for a movie set in the 1870's. And how about a cross-dressing agent (Kevin Kleine), again hip and cool for today, but really, really stupid for the 1870's.I hope this movie crashes and burns at the box office and the producers lose a bundle!

But by the time the Wild Wild West was over, all I could do was look at the person next to me and ask, ""What the hell was that?'  The acting in the WWW was okay, but it could have been better.  The story just fell apart during the beginning.  They screenwriters should have spent more time on the script.  The special effects were awesome, if somewhat borrowed.  This was my first movie after seeing The Phantom Menace six times in a row.  For some reason, after seeing TPM, the WWW made me feel like it was an unfinished movie.The acting was okay, but could have been better.  Will Smith, Kevin Kline, Kenneth Branagh, and Salma Hayek are great actors, but they seem befuddled by their roles.  I felt sorry for them.  Maybe they should have argued strongly with the director about the script.The story is a complete waste.  There is nothing funny about anything in it. The race jokes made me extremely uncomfortable, because they were not timed properly and did nothing good to add to the story.  In the past I have only seen race jokes infuriate people instead of bringing them together, so I never liked them anyway.  Most of the other jokes in the movie die.  There is one that I did laugh at, which had to do with Kevin Kline's fake breasts.I did not feel that the special effects were out of place for a movie set in the 19th century.  The Wild Wild West was always a fantasy, and in fantasies, anything can happen at any point in history, so that part of the story is not the problem.  However, the mechanical spider does look like how a MT-AT is described in the Star Wars: Jedi Academy trilogy (Novel, by Kevin J.

175,Lag2Deth,Two hours of your life that you will never get back,1,6 July 1999,"I generally avoid paying full price for first-run movie tickets because of this sort of drivel. Unfortunately, I let some friends talk me into making an exception, and I actually sat through this clunker. It was a hot July day, and the theater was well air-conditioned, which is all that prevented this experience from being a total waste of money.An awful lot of acting talent was just thrown away in this movie. Will Smith can actually act, at least a little - see ""Six Degrees Of Separation"" for an example - but here he just plays ""The Fresh Prince Wears A Cowboy Hat,"" which is probably all that's expected of him these days. Kevin Kline can be wonderfully goofy - see ""A Fish Called Wanda"" - or, if the script is bad enough, he can be the boring, two-dimensional caricature he is in this movie. Salma Hayek was great in ""Fools Rush In,"" but in this movie, her big scene is showing the camera her naked butt. I'm not making this up. Why did she even agree to be a part of this train wreck? Strangely enough, Kenneth Branagh is in this movie (slumming I guess), filling his evil nemesis role out as well as can be expected - easily the best of a bunch of pretty weak performances. M Emmet Walsh plays a part so tiny that an extra could have done it.This is a standard Hollywood mismatched-cop-partners/action movie at heart, but it can't even fill out that tired old formula worth a darn. The plots in movies of this kind are rarely worth discussing - rest assured that this one lives up to that standard, at least. The formula seems like it must be easy to get right - beat up a bad guy, make a smart remark, beat up another bad guy, etc, ad infinitum. But the fights should be exciting, and the one-liners should be funny. They aren't. It was painful to see a full theater unanimously refuse to even snicker at a jokes that the movie makers obviously thought would get belly laughs. According to the formula, the mismatched cop partners should eventually take a believable shine to each other, but these characters lack enough depth to have any chemistry at all.My friends and I all enjoyed other movies of this sort when done properly (Lethal Weapon) and other Will Smith movies (The Fresh Prince Saves The Planet - uh, I mean Men In Black).

179,artwk,Great fun,8,20 May 2006,"I amazed that so many people disliked ""Wild Wild West"", and even compared it unfavorably with such formula movies as ""Enemy of the State"", the ultra-predictable ""Independence Day"", and the long-winded and tedious ""Ali"".I enjoyed ""Wild Wild West"" so much that I grabbed the opportunity to see it again on TV. It does not pretend to be anything other than what it is -- light-hearted entertainment, not intended to be taken seriously. The plot is outrageous, the special effects brilliant, the complicated gadgetry delightful, and the performances over the top. Despite a few dull moments, the script is witty and amusing, and the characters, absurd as they are, are always consistent.Perhaps those who disliked the film were expecting something different, that is to say, more of what they are used to. If so, their disappointment is understandable. But the very essence of this comedy was its sheer unpredictability. It is not ""The Ladykillers"" (the Alec Guiness version) nor ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"", but I found it highly enjoyable, and certainly laughed out loud.",Wild Wild West

George Clooney (Artemus Gordon) and Jim and John Thomas (story) left the project before it stinks like Titanic in the cinemas everywhere. Some sources report a budget near $175 million, however Warner Brothers claim that 'WWW' costs a hundred. Doesn't matter. Smith and Kline acts as awful as their characters make 'em to. So terrible comedy from WB that lacks humor. Just imagine the level below 'Batman and Robin', and don't try this at home!",Wild Wild West

Taking ludicrous stunt moves and action from the nineties and plunking them down in a western setting was the first big mistake. Second was casting Will Smith. Sure, Smith may be a big ""pop"" sensation, but unfortunately that's all he brings to this movie: pop fluff. Smith's attitude and acting style DO NOT fit into a western movie. He's too ""urban"" sounding and acting. He talks like the fresh prince of bel air.All the stunts and fight scenes were so contrived and badly choreographed I found myself constantly shaking my head. Also, Salma Hayek was totally wasted. A woman as beautiful as disbelief. Give me The Magnificent Seven or Butch and Sundance any day. Only in a Hollywood movie do people NOT bleed when they are hammered in the face by shovels and huge monkey wrenches. Only in Hollywood can one man fight of 5 or 6 with ease.I still don't understand how we were supposed to believe that giant spider would actually work.

You may say it's not a philosophic story and you're right. It won't make you think about the essence and nature of life and the universe. But it'll make you have fun, and laugh. From time to time, critics respond to the film industry's needs and start discrediting movies. It seems this year's victim is ""Wild wild west"". People are so biased for what they read. If the critics hadn't said such awful comments about this movie, I could swear all the people's reviews would be more positive. I find more flaws in Episode 1, but that's an untouchable movie for millions, so I won't say anything about that.

185,Cyclops-13,"Wild, Wild Waste.",1,6 September 2000,"Now when I went and saw GONE IN SIXTY SECONDS,  I thought I was seeing a movie about the audience of Wild, Wild West.  This movie was one of the worst of 1999.  After all of the great movies that came out in the  year 1997 and 98, I thought for sure that 1999 would be great, but I should have known since I really didn't see a lot of good action trailers for 1999 movie season.The writing was bad and as far as I'm concerned, if you saw Will Smith in ID4 and MIB and in Bad Boys, you've seen Wild Wild West.  He's practically playing the same characters in every movie he is in and I'm getting sick of it.  That's one of the reasons why I couldn't stand this movie.  And I some how knew Salma Hayek would appear nude in the film the first time I saw her on screen and realized that this movie was going no where.  Sure enough that happened later in the film and I'm like, GROW UP PEOPLE!!!!!!  This exploitation of females in the movies has got to stop!  When Smith did his nude scene in the film, it was done in a way that you wouldn't be able to see much if not anything at all.  Not that I want to see Smith nude because I don't.  And I don't want to see her either because I respect females in the movie and would rather not have to look at them in that form.  It's being down right disrespectful.I didn't like the constant fighting between West and Gordon.  I have seen the original series, and I can tell you that when it came down to who was in charge, West was.  Did West flaunt it?  No.  Why?  Because who was there to bail West out of trouble?  Gordon was.  So we have an equilibrium here.  I liked the casting of Kline in the movie as Gordon, but all in all, I didn't like the chemistry.The plot was bad, the jokes were bad, the egos were being tossed all over the place and wanted my money back.  When I go to a movie I really enjoy, I feel as though it was done so with money well spent.  With this movie, I felt like my money had disappeared and was gone in sixty seconds.

Who in their right mind thought any of this was a good idea? Or funny? Or even interesting? Aside from the giant spider, I honestly can't remember anything that happened in this movie, that's how dull it is.What a talented cast, a formerly good director, I just have no idea where in the world this started to go off the rails, but it does, and HARD. Jokes about racism, disabilities, accents all add a layer of ugliness on top of the unfunny pile of garbage that the movie is in the first place.

WHen i got in the theater and 5 minutes into it, i was so bored i couldn't wait for it to be over. Kevin Klein and Will SMith weren't even funny in this movie. Also it was a stupid idea with all those racist jokes, and putting will smith in a role, meant for a white guy. A lesson should be learned from the director to never change a tv show's characters just to put in a big name in a movie. Only Kenneth Branagh was good, Salma Hayek was horrible too",Wild Wild West

Kevin Kline, a fine actor, does what he can as Artemus Gordon, but seems to be recapitulating his ""In and Out"" persona (Ross Martin was never that prissy.) Kenneth Branagh, as the villain, plays it so far over the top you can't even see the top from where he his. Salma Hayek is undeniably lovely, but is wasted (she's basically an afterthought).

There were various ""nods"" throughout the film that I liked (music or sets) and despite the ""lower"" budget that was spent on effects, the budget should have been spent on hiring better script writers or on Will Smith to put in his trademark humor into the movie -- intended or not, the movie was not all that funny.

I thought it was an okay movie, but not more than that.  Will Smith is a good actor and he has his moments, but this was DEFINITELY no ""Men In Black"".  I thought the story was decent enough, but it all seemed to drag on.  I can't say much more than that I was just generally not impressed overall with the movie.",Wild Wild West
194,schmigrex,Don't the people making these movies LIKE the original shows?,1,13 July 2008,"I won't add more insults -- others here have done that well enough. This movie is godawful. But I will point out two areas that seem to be staples of bad movie remakes of beloved old TV shows. First, how about getting someone to write/direct that actually liked and understood the original? That person would understand that the West-Gordon relationship was the core. In a sense, West and Gordon complimented each other to make a slick, functional crime-fighting machine: West handled the action and romance, and Gordon took care of the thinking, deception, and humor (disguises). This was a well-used TV convention -- think the Kirk-Spock-McCoy triad in Star Trek, or the great contrasty chemistry between Bill Cosby and Robert Culp in I Spy. Add a lovable villain to the mix (not an offensive atrocity like the film-Loveless) and you've got a crazy, tongue-in-cheek action classic. The filmmakers here seemingly did not know or care about the fundamentals of the original show. Not that this is necessarily a problem, but then why bother resurrecting the premise in the first place? Why not just make Will Smith a different wild west troubleshooter? The Mission Impossible franchise has the same problem.Second, why all the emphasis on showing the principals getting to know each other? I know -- because it eats up 30% of the script, and creates conflict. But the conflict should be between West and the villain. Jim and Artie should just BE. The TV show didn't bother explaining how West met and knew Gordon, any more than Barney Miller, Mission Impossible, or 24 found it necessary to have all the main characters meet and learn to work together. They were a team with a job to do. Audiences understand this concept; having a trumped-up plot about how the heroes meet and overcome their differences is a hackneyed device that only exposes the script weaknesses present. See the film version of Dragnet (a better film, though) for another example of this unfortunate trend.Finally, a comment on the ""race"" issue. Inserting content that justifies Smith-West's skin color is no more necessary than explaining Henry V's skin color when Laurence Fishburne or Andre Braugher play him on stage. Indeed, ignoring Smith's race in a movie like this one would help us all look past such issues. If a blond actor had portrayed West, nobody would have suggested a plot that explains his Norwegian background! He just would have been West, and that would be that. But color-blind casting requires courage, and could conceivably cut into the film's bottom line. So, not in this spineless script.I seldom get mad at movies I don't like. Even The Avengers didn't anger me, though it was possibly even worse than this one. This one ticked me off REAL good. Buy the original series on DVD instead, and see how it's done right.",Wild Wild West
195,growe,Relief!,7,14 August 1999,"I went to see this film with some trepidation, having heard the 'professional' critics pan it, and having read many of the user comments here. I was also a big fan of the original TV series of the 60s, so I was hoping that the film version wouldn't stumble as badly as the film of The Avengers. I wasn't keen on Will Smith as Jim West, not because he's black and the original role on TV was white, but because his screen personality didn't seem to fit the original role played by Robert Conrad. However, having now seen the film, I am pleased to report that I really enjoyed it. The effects (not just the mechanical spider, but also the removal of Kenneth Branagh's lower half) were very well done, and the film was well-paced, witty and entertaining. OK, it's not going to win Best Picture, but it was good fun, and that's really what a film should deliver. And it was infinitely more enjoyable than that over-hyped pile of trash, The Phantom Menace. I think a previous comment gave the best characterization of the film when s/he said it was like a Roger Moore Bond film, with West as Bond and Gordon as Q. Oh, and don't be put off by that atrocious music video that is being played as a trailer - the film is nothing like that!",Wild Wild West

If there is one piece of advice I can give you if you can't find anything better to watch at the cinema, it is this- go stoned. It looks better, and your brain will be already numbed.

Besides a few funny one-liners (""shoot first, shoot later, then shoot some more..."") this exercise in cinematic vanity (on both Will Smith's and Barry Sonnenfeld's part) is completely devoid of life as it trips over itself in its attempt to be hip, cool while simultaneously trying to evoke the the original TV series' ""James Bond meets Jules Verne"" spirit. Most of the jokes are anachronistic in a bad way (unlike the high concept of the series) and the plot is just plain boring.  I guess the best way to describe this movie is: boring.  And that spells death not only for a summer blockbuster wannabe but any action/comedy. I was also disappointed in the usually brilliant Elmer Bernstein's lackluster and unimaginative score. I guess it must have rubbed off on him from all other parties involved in this unmitigated mess.   I guess I'll just have to go see Phantom Menace again. 4 out of 10 stars.",Wild Wild West
198,Nathanel,Fancy graphics do not save all movies.,2,9 July 1999,"While the use of computer graphics was fairly impressive in Wild Wild West, the movie failed horribly in plot development and scripting. Wild Wild West was just unable to meet the expectations set by The Matrix and Starwars. It was unoriginal, the action scenes were not at all impressive, and about 90% of the better scenes were shown in the previews. I think I would have enjoyed the movie more if it came out a couple years ago, or at least before The Matrix, which in my opinion puts almost all other sci/fi-action movies to shame.",Wild Wild West
199,dpenny,A special kind of disaster,4,12 February 2000,"Any hack (almost inevitably produced by Jerry Bruckheimer) can make a bad movie, but ""Wild Wild West"" is that special kind of disaster that only talented people could have made.  Barry Sonnenfeld is a talented director - he made the truly inventive ""Men in Black"" in 1997 - and the stars have been appealing in the past.  But when you become too successful in Hollywood, eventually people don't question your judgment when they really should. That's what happened here.The film stars Will Smith and Kevin Kline (who disowned the film before it was released) as mid-19th century Treasury agents out to stop a mad villain - Kenneth Brahagh, who I assume really needed the money to make another Shakespeare film - from destroying America with his giant mechanical spider. I'm not leaving much out by way of plot here, but never have I seen so many jokes fall flat - Smith's constant jibes about recently-abolished slavery are especially appalling.  (Mel Brooks could have made 'em funny, but that's about it - and now I'm reminded of how great ""Blazing Saddles"" was, but that's another story.)The sad part is that there are a few flashes of inspiration throughout ""Wild Wild West"", such as a dazzling shot of 1860s Washington with the Capitol Dome under construction in the background.  But the whole production gives the aura of successful people assuming everything they touch turns to gold. This movie definitely did not.",Wild Wild West

202,viennashade,I'm pretty sure the west was never quite THIS wild,5,17 March 2014,"Most of the humor here was too adolescent for my tastes, but the guys did what they could with the madcap script. Will did his usual bankable job, and Kevin Kline was very good as well. I liked when he was playing President Grant. The Salma Hayek role was strange; she was little more than a decoration.However, the surprising choice of Kenneth Branagh as the dastardly Arliss Loveless paid off, as he was the best part of the movie (worth an extra star). Sporting an unusual facial hair design and dark hair, Branagh is unrecognizable, even when you know it's him.There were a few funny scenes amidst the lunacy, such as the one where Jim rudely whistles to get the attention of his own lynch mob, then proceeds to make the most ridiculous speech imaginable. I also liked the scene where Loveless and Jim are trying to outdo each other with decidedly un-PC insults. My favorite scene is when Artemis unveils his contraption to obtain an image from a dead man's retinas of the last thing he saw before he died. Jim is decrying this nonsense the whole time, but when an image of a man appears, he immediately proceeds to matter-of-factly and effortlessly read along with Artemis the entire text of a brochure in the man's coat pocket (at a distance, in the dark).Some people complain about racism in this movie. I took it not as racism but as making fun of racism.This would be a movie to watch perhaps at a party when you just wanted something on in the background, where nobody's really paying much attention, just watching a scene here and there. Mostly absurd, sometimes amusing and somewhat imaginative, with Steampunk touches. It wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen.",Wild Wild West
203,Franky,Waste of Time,1,4 July 1999,"Just another example of Hollywood excess gone for naught.  This film is so bad that anyone who pays to see it should have their head examined.  I'm sorry but sometimes hollywood execs should spend 100 million dollars on five smaller movies than one extravagent piece of garbage.Kevin Kline, who is one of my favorite actors, did not seem to care in this film.  Did he just phone it in?  As for the rest of the acting, well, Mr. Kline was the best.There were so many problems with the film I cannot even list them here. The first of many was that the plot just never interested you.  Then, the special effects didn't work either.Oh well, I'm sure Will Smith will make a comeback and this will not effect his bankability.",Wild Wild West

Fans of the original t.v. series will find very little familiar here, the title character, played by Will Smith, is the film's main problem. Street smart, hip, rapping dialogue doesn't fit in easily with an Old West backdrop, where in reality, someone would probably have shot him in the back. Having said that though, the film's climax, with the giant mechanical spider is one of the best f/x sequences yet committed to film in my opinion, very ""War of the Worlds"" in tone as it menaces and destroys a Western Town. All in all, if you can overlook Smith's streetwise 90s humor being a century out of place, the ending alone is worth your time.",Wild Wild West
205,DocHobbs,great looking production design is not all a movie needs,6,1 July 1999,"The high expectations for ""Wild Wild West"" will lead to somewhat of a letdown.  After the successful special effects comedy ""Men In Black""; star Will Smith and talented director Barry Sonnenfeld have delivered a great looking mess. Smith and Kevin Kline always deliver the goods; but I don't feel much chemistry there.  Also, all women in ""Wild Wild West"" have been asked to do little more than look pretty; leaving the lovely Salma Hayek reduced to the role of eye candy.  Only Kenneth Branagh, as the villain Loveless, really stands out.  He's a joy to watch, playing oh-so over the top, working well out of his element and obviously having a bit of fun. (and is it ever not great to see ol' M.Emmet Walsh anytime possible?) Visually, there are lot of inventive things about ""WWW"", particularly those cool gadgets and it's villain's unusual disability.  If only it's story had been so inventive...there really isn't much of a story.  What we're left staring at is a wonderfully designed, but noisy, soulless, and cumbersome contraption (much like that incredible spider weapon).I was never all that familiar with the original TV series, so I don't know if this film's saturday matinee spirit was fitting-but I appreciated it.

The more I watch it the more I keep thinking why it had a bad wrap.  I can't think of anything but Will Smith playing Jim West. Which was a white character in the original TV show(Not being racist or anything but they should at least be true to the TV show.  Something that been a problem lately with TV show movies.  But other then its extremeily untrue to the show I liked it because it was enjoyable to watch.  I mean I do like the type of movies that are just made to have fun(Lake PLacid, Deep Blue Sea, Big Daddy, The Waterboy, etc)  And this movie was one of them.  I will admit that this movie did have some problems.  The first thing was the racial marks that were made a bunch of times.  That was getting old, even though the scene with Smith and that Loveless guy making fun of themselves was pretty funny.  The other problem was some of the one liners in the movie. Like: ""That's it, no more mister knife guy"" and ""I learned that from a China man.""  Those lines should've been off the script but they took the chance to keep them. Another thing that I didn't like about the movie was having Salma Haleck being in the film where she had no purpose in the film but to show her cute little butt in the movie. But if u ignore these flaws, you got a very enjoyable movie.  Will Smith and Kevin Kline work very well as with Kenneth Branngh as the evil Dr. Arliss Loveless, which I like to add is in my list of best villains.  Number one is Jeremy Irons from Die Hard With a Vengence.  Kevin Kline also does a good job playing President Grant, originally offered to Robert Conrad but put it down since he too didn't like what they were doing to the movie.Some of the fight scenes weren't bad either and that 80 foot spider scene was awesome. Barry Sonnenfeld, the director of Men in Black and Addams Family, does a good job making this movie into some kind of super hero movie.  He also did a good job making the comedy scenes real funny.  I mean that touch my breast scene was just too much. I've read some magazines where they said this movie was the worst of 1999. I tell u what I've seen alot worst then this.  Example: Blair Witch, Life(totally unfunny) The Mod Squad, Galaxy Quest etc.I give this movie a 9 out of 10",Wild Wild West

I'm surprised so many people here didn't like it, I cannot see why. without giving too much away, take a western, put some jackie-chan style humour into it (perhaps a bit like Shanghai Noon), stick some modern and futuristic and totally made-up wacky Bond-like inventions in it and what you have is a weird but wonderful mix - it also has a plot which is a lot better than some of the recent movies of the last couple of years in cinemas here 8/10!!",Wild Wild West

Instead it is one long bore.I didn't want to look at that character with the ear horn more than once, or any of the rest of the maimed menagerie of wounded war veterans either!The few times that I actually laughed, it was because I couldn't believe they put such a lame line or scene in the movie in the first place - case in point, the puppy doing the ""RCA"" pose.",Wild Wild West
212,Byers,Hideously Awful,1,20 April 2000,"As a fan of the original TV show, I was really rooting for ""Wild Wild West"" to succeed.  Imagine my disappointment then, when it turned out to be a complete failure, a dud of a movie, a huge disaster; in a word, it just plane sucked.  There were so many mistakes and errors made by the so-called ""filmmakers"" that I'm not even sure where to start.  First, casting Will Smith.  Unless your willing to completely disregard the history of the late nineteenth century and make race a complete non-factor (which is not what the writers chose to do) there is no way to sell a black James West.  Hell, the giant mechanical spider was more realistic than a black army officer in the post Civil War army.  Don't get me wrong, I love Will Smith, but because he is black this role was just not right for him.  Second, the writing. Four people are credited with the screenplay, and God only knows how many others ""polished"" the script along the way.  Yet, with all this talent involved, the end result is hideous.  It reminds me of the old maxim that a thousand monkeys randomly typing on typewriters would produce Shakespeare sooner or later; well in this case, they had a lot of writers carefully and selectively typing on typewriters, and they didn't get within a parsec of Shakespeare.  The story and characters were all wrong (they needed to look at the original show, which got it right), the dialogue is truly pathetic (I got real sick of West and Gordon saying ""We have to save OUR president"" ""That monster is after OUR president"") and NONE of the jokes work.  The absolute lowest point was when the writers tried to milk humor from a lynching; perhaps in their next effort, the writers will find the humor in the gas chambers of Auschwitz, or the killing fields of Bosnia.  The musical score was also a complete failure; it was flat, unimaginative, boring and unengaging.  The music should have been building suspense, providing a rousing theme, etc.  Except, about all it provided was a headache and all it roused was my ire.  ""Wild Wild West"" is the posterchild for the hallow, overhyped Hollywood movie that is supposed to be a guaranteed blockbuster (see also ""Judge Dredd"" and ""The Avengers""), and it truly deserves the heaps of scorn and criticism which have been dumped on it.  I can only pray that Smith's next project can restore his now tarnished reputation, and that Barry Sonnenfeld never makes another movie again as long as he lives.",Wild Wild West

OK....Independence Day and Men in Black were fun, successful movies, but in my book it was in spite of Will Smith, not because of him. His street attitude and jive-ass dialogue was bad enough in those contemporary films but is totally impossible to swallow in a movie that takes place in the 1800's.But the biggest sin this new movie commits is that it just plain is not funny. It tries to be, and other than a couple of fairly amusing spots, the vast majority of the stuff is totally lame and not remotely funny.In my book the only thing that even made the movie the slightest bit worthwhile was Salma Hayek in her underwear and the 80-foot tall mechanical tarantula.I was a big fan of the original tv show and when I saw Robert Conrad (the original James West) on tv the other night totally dissing Barry Sonnenfeld and the new Wild, Wild West movie, I was kind of disappointed because I thought it is was in  poor taste and just sour grapes on his part.

Do not do that. You'll get disappointed.Do expect a predictable movie about a mad scientist who wants to conquer the US and has to be stopped by to other madmen, being a black cowboy who 'first shoots, shoots again, shoots some more and then tries to ask some questions' and another mad scientist who wants to plan everything. However, Smith is about as cool as Dr Spock in the first Star Trek series and Kline is about as stylish as Doc Brown in Back to the Future.However, there are a few nice jokes (i.e. Smith is offered a cigar in the Oval Office).

My only major complaint is that the director simply didn't bring out the comic genius of these two fine actors.  Kevin Kline has shone brightly in films such as A Fish Called Wanda and Dave, but here he barely manages a soft glow. Similarly, Will Smith has given us brilliant performances in Enemy of the State and Independence Day, but here he is reduced to poor puns at the expense of a handicapped man (albeit a twisted evil one).  Someone who would have let them have a bit more of themselves poured into the film would have made it more than above average.  The minor complaint (you know I had one) is that Salma Hayek is used as the worst sort of window dressing and appears seemingly only to show off her (very fine) behind.

220,richsifu-36077,Just a horrible mishmash of nonsense,1,19 October 2020,"We know that movies require a certain sense of suspended belief and reality to enjoy, but I've always hated movies like this that just go sooo far down the realm of ridiculousness that only a six year old child could buy into it.I won't go into so the horrible plot points as other commentators have done that well enough. Suffice it to say that Star Wars and Star Trek are far more believable and acceptable than this nonsense.Maybe it's the huge science and physics buff in me but when you have a movie set in a time that's about one hundred and fifty years ago but somehow has technology that's STILL more advanced than we have today, I simply CAN NOT take anything else the movie puts out seriously, nor can I enjoy it because to me it's like I'm living in an alternate reality or something and I simply don't like shows and movies of that nature. That's probably why I like science fiction and science in general so much. Even though science fiction is fiction mostly, because it takes place in the future there is a very logical progression and acceptance because who knows what actually have technology that's we'll have in one, two or even three hundred years. The when you have a movie like this that's going a hundred and fifty years in the past and showing technology that's 150 years in the future it's just absolutely ridiculous and a mishmash of realities that someone like myself and other people that enjoy rationale and logic over silly attempts to entertain, simply can't accept or go along with even for a couple of hours.Others who don't have this problem and whose minds aren't as much reality or science based probably have a much easier time enjoying a movie like this and those are probably the people that loved this movie.I've never seen the original show either. Since will Smith was a fan of the original show, that's probably why he thought that the matrix was ""cheap sci-fi"" as he put it. As opposed to what Will... Cheap and laughable attempts at the Borg meets the old west? Of course he's well aware that this was the biggest mistake of his career and one that still pisses him off even to this day, especially seeing how much money the matrix made and it's still enduring popularity and how unique the movies are in hollywood history.So if bad sci-fi or bad silly movies and shows like Sharknado or cheap Syfy channel type movies are your thing, then you just might like this movie.

Well, as expected, it IS bad.It's a shame really considering that this film comes out from the team behind ""Men In Black"". Smith seems more average than usual, and frankly this is the only film that I wished he just shut up. Kline makes a decent sidekick but there's no chemistry between them as they are just a flat characters. Kenneth Brannagh seems like the only one who's having fun, although he make an unthreatening, if not rather ridiculous villain. Salma Hayek....mmmmm she's ok considering that little screentime she has but I believe she would be really good if she were given a funny role...

The only cast that leaves any impression on me was Ling Bai's miss East, Loveless' concubine.The dialogues were horrible! And those attempted jokes...

But that's the problem. There's nothing majorly wrong with the visuals of this film, and that really is what the key problem here is - its all style, absolutely no substance. It looks like they've spent too much money on it that they didn't spent enough money for the script.Nevertheless, I wouldn't say this is the worst movie ever, as I don't mind to watch it again on video with friends (just to make fun and comments out of it....) But still, not a film that I would recommend...Well, to top off this, how many stars should I give for 'Wild Wild Mess'...er I mean 'Wild Wild West'? 4 out of 10 --- 3 stars for FX and production, 1 star considering the amount of money they've spent, 0 for everything else.",Wild Wild West

Will Smith takes this role and makes it serious when it needs to be, charming when needs be, and witty almost all the time. Kenneth Branaugh is a delightful bit of work in this film, and the most extertaining villain in years. On the down side, a few of the jokes don't quite work and the ending does lose a bit of steam. But the scenery and sets are gorgeous and Kenneth has a high time chewing them. Kevin Kline does a good job and Salma Hayek is given little more to do than look pretty (something she is a master at) but the main star of this show are Will Smith's charismatic performance, the sets, and the amazing special effects. This movie had me laughing in a way Austin Powers 2 only wished it could have. This is a wonderful movie.

Part of the ""old school"".Blurf. Boring. No surprises, none at all. ""Godzilla"" was grand opera compared to this.

His performance has all the elements of the ""star quality walk-on from Airport '77"", except this one last 90 minutes.

When hearing about his next film, ""Wild Wild West,"" I did anxiously expect to see a similar movie of the same calibre, the film having an excellent cast and a promising story as it seemed from the film's trailer. The wonderful music video gave me a sense that Sonnenfield's film would be one of the most fast-moving, hilariously funny blockbusters of the year!When I saw the film on its British release, I found the film completely different to what I had expected. I found the first half hour so slow and uneventful that I was soon suffering from extreme boredom, the small amount of material in the scenes nowhere near enough in quantity to keep us interested for such a long amount of time.The overall plot takes place over a hundred years ago in the usual Western setting and deals with the President of the United States hiring the two best guns in the West, handsome gunslinger James West (Will Smith) and mechanical whizz-kid Artemus Gordon (Kevin Kline) to discover the mysterious kidnappings of many scientists by a certain General ""Bloodbath"" McGrath (Ted Levine). This leads them to discover that the entire scheme is one led by the supposedly-dead and legless Dr. Arliss Loveless (Kenneth Branagh), whose plan is to assassinate the President and divide the United States, with a little help from the likes of his own magnetically charged flying decapitator and a gigantic mechanical tarantula along with his selection of dangerously seductive accomplices. Providing the romance is brothel-woman Rita Escobar (Salma Hayek), who is reluctantly taken with the two in order for her to find her allegedly kidnapped father.It seems like something fun, but most of these things are introduced far too late. After the long prologue, things do pick up quite a bit, with some genuinely funny moments and enjoyable action, but the lack of pace still tends to creep up every now and then. I'm not saying the film is awful, in fact most of the material and acting is absolutely fine, it's just that Sonnenfield really should have shortened the film by about 30 minutes, making it far more enjoyable.

Moreover, the incredibly huge mechanical spider seems to really be cruising across the deserts of the southwest.  However, these special effects did not prevail.  I still came out of this movie extremely disappointed.  Perhaps the biggest disappointment was in the plot itself.  Klein and Smith, while interesting and funny actors in their own right, are not able to revive a story that really has no point.  I spent half the movie saying to myself, ""What are they trying to do again?""  The jokes are weak and immature.  The character played by Salma Hayek is obvious eye candy.

And, yet, I have enjoyed everyone of his movies (yes, even ""Bad Boys""). Unfortunately, now that stardom and the big paycheck have arrived, Smith proves that even he needs a good script to work from.This self-styled new and hipper Wild Wild West takes its lead from the classic TV series that starred Robert Conrad as James West. Smith, as the updated West, stars with sultry Salma Hayek, Kenneth ""Mr. Shakespeare"" Branagh as the evil Dr. Arliss and Kevin Kline playing Artemus Gordon and just about every other character in the movie.Smith first appears a good fit for the West role, displaying Conrad's trademark coolness under fire. But just a few minutes into the movie, it's obvious that Smith lacks the other important quality that Conrad brought to the part: that he's dangerous.Perhaps director Barry Sonnenfield realized this and allowed Smith to inject several attempts at humor. Or perhaps it's a result of a patchwork script, parts written before Smith signed on and those after. Either way, the result is the audience left having to believe that Smith would shoot anything that breathes one second and the next holster his six shooters so that he can try and joke his way from a bunch of paunchy, old slave owners that want to hang him.The script skims over everything else. Kline hams it up as a drag dressing and invention tinkering but otherwise bland Artemus. Branagh vents his anger, as a southerner defeated and crippled by the Civil War, but never explains it. And Hayek bats her eyes and show off her cleavages (yes, plural).Kline does get some extra screen time by doing a ""Dave"" as President Ulysses S. Grant.

This movie is one of the worst ones that I have ever had to sit through.(But I haven't seen Universal Soldier the return yet either, so don't quote me on that)  There is practically no action, the plot is ridiculous, and what really makes it sad, is that the cast had what it takes to make a great movie, unfortunatley, the script did not.",Wild Wild West

Lets get that cool guy from Fresh Prince to play in a western and have some guy make cool gadgets and have alot of big machines like an 80ft spider blow up stuff and lets have some hot girl there so we can look at her breasts and show her butt for a second AWESOME!"" I mean come on! This is total crap. Don't take my word for it though, just check out the horrible rating it received and read the other comments.

248,ChineseBoxer,Men in Black 2 without the funny parts,2,1 July 1999,"Directed by Barry Sonnenfield, also from Men in Black, Wild Wild West takes the movie and sets it back a hundred or so years. Unfortunately, it also sets back the careers of all those involved with this movie. Starring the sorely underutilized Kevin Kline and the always unversatile Will Smith, the humor in this movie is not-existent. However, since I am not in this movie's apparent audience age of 4-8 years old, I found this film to be an exercise in patience. If you about 8 years old, you'll be able to appreciate a few of the jokes and humor in this movie. Otherwise, seek entertainment elsewhere and just rent Men in Black again.",Wild Wild West

Will Smith should be embarassed at himself. He has made some decent movies (""ID4"" for example), but this movie puts him in the ranks of Eric Roberts, Leo Rossi, and Shannon Tweed. If he makes another movie like this, he'd be better off sticking to Cinemax after dark movies--or possibly Lifetime Television for Women Original Pictures.This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

The special effects are great, but without a good movie around them, they can't shine, they seem to be just an excuse for not knowing how to fill the time with some good acting, a real story, some good dialogues and so on.

So i must hate it! But please don't. Yes as i said its not a masterpiece, but the movie doesn't try to be either. Its a good fun western comedy movie. Will smith and Kevin Kline plays some good funny roles in this movie. They banter pretty good and its all good fun. So don't listen to all the critics in here and just take this movie as it is.

I'm going to start with the accuracy of the movie which is 5% accurate, why they have a Lincoln look a like president I don't know, the director probably didn't know any presidents around that time. Why the hell they got machines and vehicles in this movie I do not know, I mean cars hasn't been invented until the end of the 19th Century and where did that Giant Mechanical Spider come from. Also that bloody flying vehicle, hey Wright Brothers some one beat you at it. I really think the director should do this research before filming this movie.Now on to the storyline, one word for that Lame!. It's like a spoof version of the real life civil war assassin ""John Wilkes Booth"" who assassinated Lincoln after the civil war. I said to myself when watching this, it's like Maverick meets James Bond with the gadgets and diabolical machines.The actors in the movie lets start with Kenneth Branagh, never get a English actor to play a pure Red Neck, it doesn't work!! Kevin Kline, even though his funny in every movie I seen him in, I didn't think he that good in this, he was to predictable. Salma Hayek, I found her very annoying in this movie. Finally Will Smith, sorry but in Independence Day his Quotes and out-liners ""Welcome to Earth"" were painful, but in this it's even worst, I just couldn't watch it because it was irritating.Finally I like to say please take westerns seriously, this movie is a piece of s**t that needs swiping up.",Wild Wild West

Will Smith was on the mark, Kevin Kline was on the mark, the story was pretty good, and the visuals were stunning. Granted, Salma Hayek pretty much ruined every scene in which she opened her mouth, and we could have had a little more interactions with Lovelace's lovely minions, but, despite some flaws in the script, I knew I should be enjoying myself more. It was during a transition scene that I realized what the problem was. ""Wild Wild West"" has perhaps the most uninspiring soundtrack I have heard in a long time. Instead of enhancing the movie, it was dragging it down.For example, the opening credit visuals are similar to those of the television show. One would think that the main theme would contain some kind of tribute, as well, but I could never pick it out, hard as I tried. The only time I heard the original music appear is late in the movie during one scene. It would be one thing if the TV music wasn't memorable, but it was, and it should have served as a basis for the movie music.

And Kevin Kline isn't a slouch either. So how on earth did these two get tangled up in this half-baked pastiche? Fire your agents, guys. From the opening seconds, your stomach sinks as you realize that no cliche will go unused by the hacks who cobbled together this numbing exercise in banality. The plot summary alone is enough to make you squirm, but it was a record-breaking hot day in NJ, so I went anyway. If you waste your money, too, be prepared to watch one disconnected scene after another, a spectrum of improbable (and unfunny) gadgetry, and some rather nasty zero-humor scenes. How the clods who wrote this thought we'd find massacres and lynchings humor fodder, I don't know. This movie is the pits, and I wish it would bomb. But it won't.

Wild Wild West did have a few funny lines, but the special effects were surprisingly underwhelming.  That giant spider completely and totally failed to impress me.

I don't like the usual boring westerns. I like this because it's different. I guess a lot of people found it too over the top and silly. This is just how I feel about the movie. I really like it. It's one of my favourites. If it was one of the regular boring westerns I probably wouldn't be interested anyway. I found it eccentric and a little out of the ordinary and that's what I like. That's just my take on it. I also like deep meaningful movies too but it's nice to watch something silly every now and again. I don't get the really bad ratings. One star is really harsh.

267,JeffCNN,You'd think for $180 million they could afford a decent script,2,12 July 1999,"I'm directing the so-called ""Director"" of WWW, Barry Sonnenfeld, to see a John Ford Western. Maybe then he could learn how to showcase its' beauty and wonder without making it a convenient backdrop to an 80-foot spider, where the entire screen looked computer-generated--therefore, fake.Never have I been so offended at a movie for leading me to believe it was a Western, meaning the action was nowhere near exciting and the music does not lead to a sense of urgency. In fact, the music is dull. I can tell that Elmer Bernstein had fallen asleep when writing the music and just went with the scribblings he did while dreaming. Probably dreaming of a chick-flick where music isn't as important as an $180 million summer blockbuster.I'd be much obliged if someone could tell me what Salma Hayek is doing in this picture? That's it. She doesn't serve to help the film in any manner other than have guys stare at her body. Highly under used.The chemistry between Smith and Kline is nonexistent. When they're supposed to be ""bonding"" by challenging each other every other minute, I wasn't convinced that they were becoming partners. Kenneth Branagh should be crying himself to sleep after accepting the role of Dr. Loveless. Spewing racial epithets at Smith while circling 'round and 'round in his wheelchair were not worthy of his acting credentials.The humor? Flat. I laughed one time. I don't even remember which part, but I do know it was only once. Maybe a smirk or two once in a while, but only one actual guffaw. Scenes that might have been funny were extended for laughs, and didn't work. I'm yelling ""Get on with it!

With such a cast and such materials, this film have great potentials but failed to fully utilize its resources.

Both are horribly written and directed:  only ILM's effects kept me in Wild, Wild West for most of the film.The Fresh Prince/Barry Sonnenfeld team worked perfectly for Men In Black, but falls flat on its face here.  I heard that Sonnenfeld says he wants to work with The Fresh Prince in every movie from now on.  If that's so, God help us, because he was a complete miscast for Wild, Wild West.It's a shame that the artists at ILM won't have their name seen by the audience, who will undoubtably run from the theatre as soon as the credits roll (I ran before that point).  Their work is spectacular, but is eclipsed by everything else that is bad about this movie, as is almost always the case with spectaular effects.The opening credits are the only other good thing in it.

There is not a single laugh, a single surprise, or a single moment of real entertainment in the entire film. How such a talented group of people managed to spend $160 million on such a godawful train wreck is almost inconceivable. The script is witless, relying almost entirely on jokes about breasts (hypnotic, fire-spitting, buckwheat-filled, or used as jungle drums) and genitalia (throbbing phallic machines, allusions to mechanical devices, Will Smith burying his face in Kevin Kline's crotch, etc). Selma Hayek is utterly wasted, as are the usually talented Smith and Kline. Kenneth Branagh tries hard and is the best thing in the film - but can't overcome the dreadful material he's given to work with.

271,Robin-55,Wild Wild Waste of My Time,1,2 July 1999,"This was a significant disappointment from Sonnenfeld who seems to have been steadily improving as a director since his underwhelming Addams Family debut (there are those of us who rather wish he'd remained a director of photography).I can't quite imagine how this wrong-headed mostrosity got off the ground although I can imagine the studio light being stuck on green where Will Smith is concerned. But this? This? Who ever thought that this was a good idea for a summer movie? There seems to be something fundamentally wrong with it like at the most basic level, the idea is rotten, like the first conception of the project was rooted in some bizarre temporary insanity, the conclusion perhaps that Will Smith is all a movie needs to be a smash.This is the most cynical and contrived form of film-making, the packaging of elements to excite a broad demographic, the synergistic Burger King tie-ins, music videos etc for maximum market coverage. But what is centrally lacking here is the movie itself. It is a dismal spiritless mess, devoid of any chemistry between its leading characters, an entirely unnecessary female character (Salma Hayek in an awesomely thankless part) and an utterly rubbishy villain (Kenneth Branaugh not nearly as funny as he seems to think he is).Of course the actors cannot be blamed. They are only actors for Christ's sake. What really counts in a deal like this is the script and Wild Wild West simply did not appear to have one. The plot was utterly incidental, a routine and tiresome paper chase across the old west to find a bad guy with a ridiculous bad guy world domination plan. This would be fine if the movie dispensed with plot and left Smith and Kline centre stage with a huge quantity of electrifying witty banter, but it doesn't. Instead they are given swathes of plot-related dialogue as though we were actually supposed to be interested. In the whole film, I don't think I saw one decent line of dialogue, not a single solitary spark of wit. No clever wordplay, nothing in fact that could justifiably be called comedy writing. Not even any of Will Smith's patented verbal clowning. Just talk and pulling silly faces.An embarrassment for everybody concerned, especially Kline who really aught to know better by now. The only person who comes out of this with dignity intact is director of photography Michael Ballhaus, who makes the desert look like a surrealist painting, as though John Ford and Rene Magritte had conceived a child in a crazy threesome with Alexandro Jodorowsky.Otherwise, I want my money back.

I don't know what movie BadBoy-11 saw but it sure wasn't the same one I did. The only thing I can figure is that Will Smith has to be BadBoy-11 or maybe it's someone whose career depends on this piece of crud. It's hard to insult a 60's TV show but this movie did it. You're better off watching reruns of the original then wasting your money on the film. I heard George Clooney backed out of this film and I have to say GREAT CAREER MOVE George you have some taste! How this bad script got past Kevin Kline's usually great taste is beyond me, the money must have been too good to pass up. Can you tell how much I dislike this movie yet? The only dance scene I hated more then Will Smith dressed as a woman in this movie was the one in The Mod Squad (don't ask). Do I have anything nice to say? Okay, I liked the RCA dog / megaphone scene but 98% of the audience will miss that because they either have a) fallen asleep b) walked out, or c) have their eyes closed because they can't stand to see a very good TV show made into a very bad 170 million dollar BOMB!

In fact, if you go into this movie expecting a takeoff, be prepared to be very disappointed.On the other hand, if you approach this as just an entertaining movie with no expectations for it to be like something else, you will likely enjoy this very much.  Think of is as Men in Black set in the 19th century.  The acting is similar to that movie as is the humor.  Lots of humor and some very entertaining situations and great one liners.My biggest complaint was that the movie was too short (2 hours including previews and other assorted stuff at the beginning).If you are looking for the Wild Wild West, look in your TV guide.

Spawned from a far greater series this West has its moments.  The action sequences are spectacular and only paralleled by great special effects.  Kenneth Branaugh pays the psycho inventor Dr. Arliss Loveless (oh the irony of names, but it adds to the campiness of the whole thing). For once the trailers didn't give away a crucial plot/character element, i.e. Loveless wheelchair. The west is full of out right humor but is much more appreciated for its snide and subtle humor (sheep and French for instance). The best thing about this movie is the fact that it branches out on its own and creates a whole new West and leaves the TV series safe in history.  The only parallels come in through genre and a few name sakes.  If you were disappointed with Star Wars this movie will give a start to making it up to you.",Wild Wild West

There were some good episodes.  There were also plenty of bad episodes and the movie is more like those.The best idea in the movie IS the amusing technology: Nearly all of the contraptions are steam-powered. But overall, the rest of the movie is silly & half-assed.  In Hollywood's favorite trick, filming began before a decent script was completed.The opening scenes are dead on arrival. Characters haven't even been introduced before there's a fight, a horse-chase, and a variety of western set-pieces that were stale fifty years ago.  You haven't warmed up to the movie at all before you find yourself repelled.  (McGrath tilts his hearing horn and brown goo flows out of it)   Scenes in the latter half look cheap because they opted to film exteriors as digitally inserted backgrounds. Perhaps that shaved a few bucks off the $200 mil this thing cost.It has insipid ideas that will leave you groaning: - Shining a light through the back of a cadavers head to project the final image on his corneas - Henchmen hidden within living paintings - Rubber rope - Will Smith and Kevin Kline in utterly unconvincing drag, that still manages to fool the imbeciles this movie is teeming with.Smith and Kline have zero chemistry together.  Because Hollywood is uncomfortable with two men relating in any way but a rivalry, the writers made them reluctant bickering partners. (Wasn't that fresh the last six hundred times you saw it?)Smith is miscast.  The producers wanted bankability, not credibility. Once he was chosen to play a black marshall in 1869, the script was forced to acknowledge the anachronism.  For these writers it meant doing it over and over and over!  Race is the tiresome focus of too many scenes.Smith is squeaky clean, and he's an uninvolved performer.  He trades on attitude & likability, not competence in the role.   It would take an edgier performer than Smith to send nasty material like this over.  (race-bating, disabled-bashing, a lynching!??!)

I've never seen the original TV series, and maybe I'd have a more informed opinion if I had, but I immensely liked what I saw. I had never known Kenneth Brannagh was English until I saw him in the second Harry Potter, but I thought he did a wonderful job as Dr. Loveless. Will Smith was both funny and dedicated as Capt. West.

Remember,history is replete with untold tales of wars unwon. This one sheds premises on what could happen if a confederate got his hands on the best minds the world has ever seen. Now the characters are in need of depth. Will Smith is always great to watch fight but leading man material I still sometimes debate although ""Ali"" brought him closer to Actors stage. Selma Hayek I think played the role to the best that was given her. People forget with even suttle period movies the role of the women in America must always be represented and her being willing to risk her life for her husband made her character believable. My hats goes off to Kevin Branagh whom played the villain with sheer hatred in his heart. Not calling branagh a racist but after watching that part he sure scared me. And that is what acting is about. Give this film a good place on your DVD collection when you want to just watch mind numbing action with very little thought. At the very least try to catch all the banter between branagh and Smith. Some of those comments are really borderline to see the least. You may even find Bill Meher using some on his show they are so racist. But all in all a decent film.",Wild Wild West

286,TonyKissCastillo,"Should Have Been Titled ""Wild Wild WORST""!",3,11 February 2016,"When you go to see a Will Smith movie, you expect it to be entertaining and fast-paced. A movie with Kevin Kline might have your expectations leaning more in the direction of cerebral, tight-knit & solid entertainment. If Salma Hayek is in it, well ....at least you expect a flick with visual appeal ...1, 2, 3 STRIKES...Wild Wild West STRIKES OUT! TALK ABOUT DROPPING THE BALL! Will Smith, whose laid-back, street-wise- cracking veneer, usually hides a well-focused on screen intensity that is both impossible to miss or dislike...seemed to be sauntering through the film, feeling embarrassingly like a walking anachronism, considering the ""Old West"" backdrop! Kevin Kline, on the other hand, who usually brings a certain air of bravura to his oft-times eccentric characterizations, seemed to display a marked inability to take himself seriously when in drag, (Which, unfortunately, is during a good chunk of the film) lapsing into a pathetic sort self-parody, which, considering the script, may have been the only way he could stomach the role! Salma Hayek, for whom no one is exactly holding their breath for her to win an Oscar as Best Actress, seemed OBSESSED with getting her lines out with as little accent as possible...Despite the fact that she was clearly cast as Mexican in this film...(As opposed to her bit part in The FACULTY!) You could almost imagine ""La Mejicanita"" standing there, during shooting, with her Accent/Dialogue Coach, just out of camera range! Salma...concentrate MORE on your ACTING, next time, O.K.? As far as Barry Sonnenfled's Directing is concerned...well, here we could imagine him running around frantically, till the last minute, editing and re-editing, trying to decide exactly what it is he was trying to do with ""WILD""....and of course, not even coming CLOSE to getting it right! The ONLY reason I rated the movie 3 Stars (as opposed to 0 Stars!) is because of the scope & the novelty of the Special Effects. The idea of seeing all those well orchestrated, and at times visually stunning effects against an Old West backdrop was the only refreshing and original element in the film ...If you are not a die-hard Special Effects buff, I can think of absolutely no reason on earth why you would find anything at all worth seeing in this pathetic excuse for a Blockbuster film! 3*STARS*....ENJOY/DISFRUTELA?????

293,Sagsag,"Oh, the humanity",3,2 August 1999,"I would like to start this article with a full list of what I consider to be this movie's advantages (or the reasons for one to watch this film). The first item of this list would probably be the amusing jokes and situations throughout the movie. The two other items would be Salma Hayek's butt and Salma Hayek's cleavage. Other than that, most of the movie was senseless infantile trash, suitable material for yet another episode of ""Power Rangers"".The movie, based on a 1965 TV series by the same name, tells the story of one Jim West (Will Smith), a supposedly extraordinary US marshal, and another one Artemus Gordon (Kevin Kline), a supposedly extraordinary US marshal as well, shortly after the civil war. While the two are separately investigating the same certain case, they bump into each other and are teamed by the president to save the USA. They reveal a conspiracy by one Dr. Loveless (Kenneth Branagh) to take the USA apart so the land would be handed to its ""rightful owners"" (namely Loveless himself, as well as Britain, Spain and Mexico). Loveless' intentions are to make the president sign the contract for the USA's surrender after taking the entire US hostage by producing a mass destruction weapon, developed by high-caliber scientists, which were kidnapped and enslaved by him. The gunman West, teamed by gadget-man Gordon, are out to destroy Loveless' plans and save the world.The result of this plot (a fairly standard, chewed-up ""good vs. bad, good kills bad and saves the world"" plot, actually) in this case, is a movie lacking any sense or logic (or coherence with history), which will by no doubt insult the intelligence of any brain-equipped viewer over the age of 15. I suppose the gimmick of the movie is the fact that at those times there were no electricity, so all the gadgetry had to be completely mechanical. The answer to the electricity issue, however, was always steam and springs -- starting from Gordon's spring loaded gadgetry and the reasonable steam powered train and tank, and ending with the completely preposterous steam powered wheelchair (controlled by a joystick and possesses some amazing remote-control capabilities), or a steam powered megaphone (!). Another scene presents some supposedly powerful (yet small) magnets with a rather peculiar behavior (a full list of all the factual mistakes in this scene, not to mention the whole movie, is far beyond the scope of this article). Besides the technical lack of logic, some actions performed by some of the characters are absolutely senseless as well. An example for such irrational behavior lies in the final duel between West and Loveless. I will not describe the actual act here so I would not ""spoil"" for anybody (as if it is possible in such a predicted film).Some compare Will Smith's character (Jim West) to James Bond. I find this comparison utterly groundless. How can one compare the elegant yet discreet and cunning gentleman, working in the secret service of her highness to the brutal rash man who deals situations by ""shooting first, shooting again, shooting some more and after everybody dies, trying to ask a few questions"" (as was put by one of the movie's characters)? How can one compare the deliberated and clever agent to the hot-blooded US marshal who slaps the breasts of a woman in public, during one of the scenes? Bond would never do that even if he were certain the woman is indeed a man!While the movie is very infantile, it contains some very adult-oriented jokes and scenes in it, which I have found quite amazing (in fact, the film was rated PG-13 for this very reason), considering the other parts of the film. The peek at Salma Hayek's tush is actually quite innocent, but a close up of at Ms. East's (Ling Bai) rear-end in a G-String is not innocent at all. Such more scenes are probably the whorehouse scene (depicting half naked people), the fight on Loveless' ""spider"" (depicting some freaks of nature) and finally a scene where light is being projected through a man's once-was-head to see the last picture he have seen before he died (which, horrifyingly, turns into a joke as well, as Will Smith repeatedly mumbles: ""T-that is a m-man h-head""). These scenes stand in contrast to the infantile content throughout the movie -- while most of the movie is probably appropriate for little children alone, other is certainly not. Having seen the movie with my 11 years old brother, I sometimes think maybe he shouldn't have seen it at all (although he apparently liked the movie).Finally, what really intrigues me most is the participation of a high quality actor as Kenneth Branagh in this silliness. I suppose he played his role well (a mad man's character, anyway), but I don't think this movie would look good in such an actor's resume.In the bottom line, the film might have been quite funny; but then again there are much funnier films. I gave it 2/10 because I could have stayed in the theater throughout the movie (although I have been with my little brother, a fact which probably prohibited me from leaving). If you are above the age of 16 and you have the choice, DO NOT go to see this movie.",Wild Wild West

After all it is based on a television series with one of the more outlandish, albeit cool, fun and original, plot devices. The way I see it, director Barry Sonnenfeld took the television show to a different level. The original was different and hip for the 1960's, but I doubt that same approach would have worked in the 1990's. True the film took a lot of liberties with historical facts, assumed or otherwise. But so did the t.v. show. And the addition of more current '90's references didn't help (I'd say that's my biggest problem with the movie, aside from Will Smith's ridiculous belly dancing scene). But then the original series wasn't a stickler for accuracy. Just look at the mens' 1960's hairstyles and the women's 1960's style make-up.

The comradery that the characters had in the series was missing, and I would have liked to see that.I also had a problem with the soundtrack.  Elmer Bernstien's score could be called at best ""workman-like"".  It's there, but it doesn't inspire.

Can't even recommend to 'rent the video'.  Some of the scenes were unnecessary and poorly written and the chemistry between actors was nonexistent.The villain was handicapped, which made it difficult to fear him; it is likely that wheelchair users will take offense to.   I took offense to it. The deep south almost-hanging routine was poorly written and in bad taste. Not funny.   Having both characters appear in several scenes 'in drag' was also in poor taste and didn't add to the film.   Offensive to family values and not a movie to take the kids too.  Now, the same could be said of ""Blazing Saddles"", which was a great movie, but this movie isn't even close.It did have several good scenes, but these weren't enough to save the film. The ""east meets west"" scene where West confronts the asian girl was my favorite.The original theme song was only played briefly, once, in the film; a poor substitute was used for the opening score.

313,ICEMAN-72,"A very ambitious movie, but it falls short of the mark.",3,3 July 1999,"First of all, the chemistry between Will Smith and Kevin Kline (two, in my opinion, very charismatic actors) was almost non-existent.  This is truly a shame as they are the central characters.  I can't quite put a finger on it, but our protagonist just don't jell, either as a team or as would-be (soon-to-be) partners.Second, Salma Hayek is totally wasted in her role.  Anyone could have done this, or better yet, don't do it at all.Third, the ""real"" action in the movie takes place too late in the film. That combined with some questionable suspension of disbelief factors, the movie seems overly long.Finally, the chances of an African American working as a U.S. Marshall in 1863 are slight, but apparently that's been accepted by the audience, evidenced by their arrival to the theater.  That said, why did nearly every scene feel the need to remind us that James West was black?  ""Blazing Saddles"" already did it, and better.  (By the way, I'm African American)On the positive side, however, the movie does have a few interesting ideas; in particular, the making of Dr. Loveless, who was played wonderfully in the original series by Michael Dunn (a midget), a man who had no lower extremities whatsoever.  I thought Kenneth Branagh went a bit over the top, but when doesn't he?I also enjoyed the ideas' of this being the initial teaming of our heroes and how they get that incredible train.  M. Emmett Walsh is always a treat!The special effects were outstanding!  The giant tarantula was truly inspired.All in all, the movie is pretty true to the original series, but lacks its' tongue-in-cheek approach.  In the TV series, Artie (Ross Martin) was a ""cool"" genius; Kevin Klines' Artie is more of a ""goofy"" genius.  This might not be a significant point, but due to the lack of chemistry between Smith and Kline it makes me wonder if that was the way to go.The night before I saw this movie I saw the music video for Will Smith's ""Wild, Wild West""; It was actually better than the movie.",Wild Wild West

Everything went too fast and it was difficult to follow exactly what was going on.  The television show was better at plot and character development on a weekly basis than this movie.  Will Smith was very likeable as Jim West. Kevin Kline certainly had potential as Artemus Gordon but he came off as a whiner.  Salma Hayak appeared to be a plot device with two main purposes. #1- Give the agents clues without them having to spend any time working for them.  This allowed more time for overdone special effects. #2- A consistent source of cleavage!!!  This movie was certainly obsessed with breasts.All in all, I was highly disappointed.

Sonnenfeld who did such a great stylish updating of the Addams Family seems to have been drinking absinthe when he cast Will Smith as James West. Smith is a fine actor but he's no more suited for the part than Jim Carrey or Tom Hanks would have been either. Did no one notice he and Kevin Kline didn't have one tenth of the chemistry that Robert Conrad and Ross Martin did? The reinvention of Dr. Loveless is not only Kenneth Branaugh's worst performance but an insult to the great work Michael Dunn did on the original series. The whole film misses the charm of the ""James Bond in the old west"" that allows for the fun of repeated viewings of the classic episodes. Atrocious attempts at humor add nothing.

If you want to see a funny Will Smith movie, see Men in Black, don't bother with this.The only thing worth giving a star to this movie is you see a butt shot of Salma Hayek(is that how you spell her name).I heard the only reason that Will Smith was proud of this movie was because it gave him the freedom from his 4th of July box office hit expectations. Thank god he brought Ali and I Robot to the for-front. Maybe he should have left MIB II alone",Wild Wild West
320,verkisto,Amusing but ultimately disappointing.,3,1 July 1999,"Although I was not exactly anticipating this movie's release and had never liked the TV series, I decided to go check this one out on the basis of the previous work of the talent involved.  I liked Sonnenfeld's previous films (especially his work with the Coen brothers) and Men in Black in particular was a lot of fun.  Unfortunately, this is not remotely as exhilarating as any of those films, and while often inventive and engaging, it pretty much falls flat. There are some good gags, mostly when Smith and Branagh trade insults, and Kline is good as usual.  Hayek shows her ass and that's about it.  The violence is dark but not blackly funny as it should be--just sort of cruel for the hell of it, such as when one very minor character gets shot point-blank in the belly.  There is a good scene where Smith fights off a number of bizarre, zombie-like henchmen, but the action is poorly-lit and, like other sections of the film, somewhat confusing.  I wonder if this was meant to be released later in the summer and post-production suffered from a bumped-up schedule. The best scenes often seem rushed, whereas others meander with unnecessary padding.  Kids will probably like it...I'd recommend seeing it at a matinee or when it hits the second-run circuit.",Wild Wild West
321,pheede,Boring action-comedy,1,27 June 1999,"With all the hype this movie has received, it is hard to imagine it not being a great success. Whatever success it does have, it won't be due to the acting performances by the stars of the movie such as Will Smith, Kevin Kline and Salma Hayek.Having seen the movie at a special preview before the world premiere, I must admit to being rather disappointed. While I didn't expect a whole lot from the trailer (my only thought was ""what in God's name is that spider!?"") I was still not satisfied. Will Smith's acting is OK but no more than that. Kevin Kline has some great moments, but suffers from the horrible plot. Salma Hayek is only in the movie for one thing: Her name and good looks (which of course is a bonus for the film).Having said that, I still give the movie a 7 out of 10 - which in my book is an average OK movie worth watching on video or TV..",Wild Wild West
322,bwayfreak,Fun to watch but typical,1,17 July 1999,"Well, the movie is fun to watch. It has one or two funny parts, and maybe one or two cool action parts. However, it is predictable and typical. You have your hero who is too cool for words (Will Smith), his crazy sidekick who is there mainly for comic relief (Kevin Cline), and don't forget the Damsel in Distress (Mr. Kayek)! Unfortunatly, it is hard to make a good movie from a cheesy 60s TV-Show. Nice try anyhow. Though it, overall, isn't very good, it's still kind of fun to escape into the world of cowboys and endless solutions. However, as this review states over and over, it isn't a good movie.",Wild Wild West
323,aterenzo,Left me wildly indifferent...,4,1 July 1999,"As I was walking out of Wild Wild West all I could think was, ""Eh.""  I was hoping for a movie with either the blockbuster lavishness of Independence Day or perhaps the flat out cuteness of MIB, but I found neither.  The usually likeable Will Smith played a character who was neither likeable nor interesting.  The incredibly talented Kevin Kline and the lovely Salma Hayek were horribly wasted in what were painfully one-note characters.  The only person who truly managed to shine through this sad film was Kenneth Branagh.  He was funny, despicable, and pulled off a great Southern accent for a Brit.  Will Smith's memorial day hat trick will probably be unaffected when it comes to box office, but this movie doesn't hold a candle to its predecessors OR to the talent of its cast.",Wild Wild West

325,Speedy-21,It Wild Wild Sucks!,1,6 July 1999,"Great FX, sets and costumes can't save this movie. It took six story and screenplay people to make this big a mess, and I hope that it creeps into the cinematic obscurity it deserves. A great cast is wasted - Wil Smith plays James West as a lucky bungler, Kevin Kline looks embarrassed to be there, Salma Hayak is there primarily so we can see her ass; the only person who seems to enjoy himself is Kenneth Branagh, who's given the opportunity to chew all the scenery he wants. His beard is probably the best effect in the movie. There's supposed to be burning sexual tension between Salma and the two leads, but there is absolutely none.The problem is the meandering and confusing script that completely shuts down several times, and gives us some REALLY embarrassing moments (the ""touch my breast"" scene, poor Wil Smith in drag, the endless ""wandering in the desert"" sequence) and in the end goes nowhere. The direction is terrible, too; there isn't an ounce of chemistry between the characters, and I found myself rooting for Dr. Loveless.What a mess. It's 1999's ""Godzilla.""",Wild Wild West
326,Colonel-7,One of the most Vile Pieces of Crap ever to hit the Screen,1,9 July 1999,"This film is terrible.  It is, without a doubt, one of the most vile pieces of crap to ever hit the Silver Screen.  Virtually every joke falls flat (Exception:  one or two lines from M. Emmett Walsh).  Will Smith's character is not likable at all (although he sure does try).  Kenneth Branaugh, one of the finest modern Shakespearean actors around, should be disgusted with himself and his character.  The effects from ""visual marvels"" (ha-ha) such as ""Jason and the Argonauts"" and ""Clash of the Titans"" were far superior to this film's big Spider Machine. The plot holes riddled the movie like a Gatling Gun.  And during a time when Cultural Sensitivity is such a huge buzzword in the entertainment industry, attempts at humor using the words ""Black,"" ""Coon,"" ""Slave,"" ""Boy,"" and the ""N-word"" are just shameful.  I left the theater feeling sorry for Kevin Kline and Will Smith, for associating themselves with such garbage.  To all of you out there--see this movie at your own peril!",Wild Wild West
327,Tidaleye,Overall good,6,30 June 1999,"I caught this movie the night before it came out during a tech screening at the movie theater I work at.  I enjoyed it a good deal.  Unlike Men in Black, this movie isn't just jokes and visual sight gags.  WWW has a good on-running plot and even when the jokes aren't coming, it is enjoyable.The effects are tremendous and Will Smith gives yet another A+ performance. My main complaint regarding the film is Salma Hayek's performance and character.  She was completely unnecessary and Hayek herself turned out a bad acting job.No one else who screened the film liked it as much as I did, and the reviews are saying it's bad, but for me, it was two hours well spent. 7/10",Wild Wild West
328,Omega-15,One wild rollercoaster--but not without its flaws.,6,3 July 1999,"Wild Wild West is one fun movie. The plot was original and very well executed, however the movie was lacking in the acting arena. Poor performances from nearly all the actors detracted from the movie, but if you're not a serious film critic, you probably wouldn't notice it.The film itself shines in the area of special effects. A lot of you are probably saying ""hold on a sec, special effects is like laser or lightsaber fights from Star Wars!"" Well that's not all there is to it. The giant mechanical spider that goes roaming around the west is very well done, as are all the fancy gizmos that Jim West uses to save the country.If you like action films, Wild Wild West is one fun movie that you shouldn't miss this summer.",Wild Wild West

330,Greg-155,Mild Mild West,4,4 July 1999,"Lame! Quick breakdown: everything to blame for this movie lies in the crappy screenplay. I've heard better script ideas from a 5-year-old retelling his dream --and this was written by four adults! Smith does the same character he has in ""Bad Boys,"" ""ID4,"" ""Men In Black,"" and ""Enemy of the State,"" but he lacks his charisma and charm. He and Kline also lack chemistry. Hayek overdid everything --I feel she was only put in as a marketing coy. Oh yeah...the tarantula thing. How could that be possible in 1869 if it's not even possible now? And since it's 1869, what's up with the Armani suits and the quarter-sized shades? Too unbelievable for the audience to let slip by.",Wild Wild West

Unfortunately the target audience missed it by 30 years. The female roles seem to have been injected at a late stage to spice up a caper movie that falls as flat as the mechanical spider  that threatens the US Presidency - or something. The villain (a dwarf in the tv original) has no legs, which I suppose is a pc compromise, but how refreshing it would be to see a disabled person in a life affirming role.I saw this with my polite 13 year old, who didn't want to watch South Park with his Dad.

Better than Stars? you got to be Kidding me, since Star wars 1 came out by far the story and action sequences were great just a stellar performance I may add.  Wild West star Will smith was good but not great; because I found some scenes boring and it drag along to slow.  Take it from me some scenes were good others were just to long and yet Will Smith did a very good job doing it.  Yet, some things were just too much of the obvious from what I found.

It was funny and entertaining, but I don't think there was much more they could do with it. The movie has good effects and Kline is great as always.

If you've seen any trailer or promo for WWW, you've seen every big surprise this movie has to offer.  That's too bad because what could have been a fun film fell flat for me.  Kline's Artemis is good though.  I usually like Smith, but here he wasn't particularly exciting to me.  Branagh's villainy is worthy of the old TV show.  The design aesthetics are interesting and the effects are good.  The movie isn't horrible, but it's not great.

I wasn't upset by the acting, the script, or even the effects.  Smith and Kline both deliver their lines very well, even if they don't look like they're talking to anyone but a microphone, there are a few good laughs, and the cinematography/scenery for the film is excellent.I just felt unengaged.  I did not care who lived and who died by the time the film reached the second reel.  Seeing a film where you don't really care what happens can be a unique experience.  Add to it that Salma Hayek is billed as being in this movie (even though she doesn't seem to be) and the film earns it's reputation.I would recommend this film to:*Die-hard Will Smith fans*People who enjoyed ""The Avengers""I wouldn't recommend this film to:*Fans of Kenneth Branagh*Fans of Kevin Kline*Fans of Salma HayekI can't say I liked the film.  It was very well-made, well-acted and well-shot, but it wasn't well-written, and the actors in this film deserve better.",Wild Wild West

Hayek in particular, appears to not be able to act to save his life. Smith character is so dull, you hope somebody kill him off after the first half an hour. The only half decent performance is from Branagh, who at least has some fun. The special effects are not very convincing at all. The giant spider is a lot less realistic than the AT-AT from Empire.

Kenneth Branagh is the best baddie ever (I just love that accent). The only thing that is wrong with this movie is Salma Hayek.

343,Inque,"Dear God, make it stop!",1,15 September 2000,"Okay, let's cut to the chase: This is an awful movie, the worst that the summer produced. It is by turns boring, offensive, overdone, and plain bad.There are some serious casting flaws. The biggest of these is Will Smith as West. Smith is too much of a smart-aleck, and too young, to pull of this role. An older actor, like Samuel L. Jackson, could have done a much more believable job.Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh chew scenery with wild abandon, but at least both are tolerable, and Kenneth at least seems to be having a good time. Salma Hayek is an intelligent, believable actress, as long as her lips aren't moving. Then it's all shot.One major problem is the awkward treatment of the character of West as a black man. The film takes place in the 19th century, when racism was an issue. The films responds to this issue with some trite references and lots of racial jokes, which were not only unfunny but offensive. I point my readers to ""Blazing Saddles,"" which was a lot more controversial, perhaps, but handled the issue in a stronger manner, and was also damned funny.Aside from the casting and insensitivity, this film is simply boring. Nothing happens, and it can be very hard to watch. There are not enough good jokes to help, either.What should have been an exciting western with a twist turned into an agonizing quest to find the remote control before the film got any worse. I watched it through to the end, so that others like you should not have to. You have been warned.",Wild Wild West

Unfortunately, they made the worst decisions ever.I had assumed that this movie WAS GOING TO BE MODELLED AFTER THE TV SHOW!!! That would be a safe assumption, right? Instead they cast Will smith as the lead? I don't understand this. What was the target audience? Obviously it wasn't the fans of the show, or western fans in general.What better actor to put in this role than Bruce Campbell? You may know of him from the Evil Dead series, but I feel his true role in life was to play Brisco County Jr. (look it up). This was a Boam/Cuse production that was unfortunately short lived on FOX (1993). But it was a perfect prequel to what the WWW movie should have been. All about the old west and 'the next coming thing' (the future).But, back to this movie... There was no real thought put into this movie. It was obviously a 'formula movie'. 1 part young popular actor, 2 parts computer effects, sprinkled with gorgeous women. The only thing that the producers forgot about formula's... Mixed in the wrong proportions you WILL create a BOMB!!!It may not have been a hit if it were produced by Boam, Cuse, Raimi, and Campbell. But it would have been more successful and another cult classic.I'm glad I waited for the TV version. I have better things to spend my money on. I gave this movie a 1 of 10.

I found it funny, witty and overall very well done.  Will Smith is excellent in the part of Jim West, the trigger-happy smart talking cowboy, as is Kevin Kline in the part of Artemis Gordon, the genius master of disguise.  But the man who really steals the show is Kenneth Branagh in the part of the evil mastermind Dr. Loveless. He creates humour in the role of the cold-blooded criminal, as well as keeping the character's part as a 'southern gentleman'.  The word-play between Loveless and West is fabulous, and the friendship that grows between West and Gordon is developed nicely. The only problem I really have with this film is Selma Hayek's character. It's like the directors were thinking, 'hey, we need a chick in this film, you know, so we have, like, sexual tension and stuff.' and had her written in. She just doesn't seem to fit that well.

I mean a giant spider driven by legless Loveless? Come on.

Perhaps, the people who don't like this remake were big fans of the original series. Well, I was born in the mid-80s, and have zero knowledge of what the original series was about, or who was in it, so I'm only judging this film individually on its own merits.After 20+ years of watching this one over and over again, I still find it just as hilarious as I did when it first premiered. Not only is Will Smith as ""Jim West"" extremely cool and comfortable playing the role of a western cowboy, but his comedic chemistry with Kevin Kline is perfect. They constantly feed off of each others humor and maintain the flow of a very blunt, dry style of comedy.Additionally, and most importantly, I want to praise the performance of Kenneth Branagh, who I absolutely love as ""Dr. Arliss Loveless."" He is not only the perfect antagonist opposite of Will Smith, who constantly roast one another in crude (typically, racist ways) throughout the film, but his unique ability to be sitting in a wheelchair with no legs, use a Deep South accent, deliver hilarious one-liners and be an evil villain genius ruining people's lives simultaneously is exactly what made me enjoy the movie more than anything.Oh, by the way, Kevin Kline playing the dual role of ""Artemis Gordon"" and President Ulysses S. Grant was very impressive. Also, having the sultry and sexy, but very innocent, Selma Hayek on the screen definitely added an extra spice to the film.So regardless of what the haters may think of this remake of ""Wild Wild West,"" I more than enjoyed it, because the individual performances were excellent, and they all played together very well in a pretty funny storyline.",Wild Wild West

The film is entertaining and the plot has some surprises.Not a film I would see again.",Wild Wild West
363,Cavebear,An oxymoron: boring action film.,4,4 July 1999,"WILD WILD WEST opens with a kinetic scene reminiscent of director Barry Sonnenfeld's earlier films (ADDAMS FAMILY, MEN IN BLACK). It is then followed by a title sequence with the opening credits. While watching the chaotic montages mixed with art-deco graphics, I noticed that WWW has an incredibly large number of people credited with producing and writing the film. ""This cannot be a good thing,"" I thought.Unfortunately, I was right. There is nothing particularly wrong with WWW, so much as there is nothing particularly right about it. It's a small film on a big screen and suffers accordingly. It is supposed to be a blockbuster, but lacks the necessary elements to be great summer entertainment.The stars lack chemistry and charisma. The cast--Will Smith, Kevin Kline, Kenneth Branagh and Salma Hayek--should pack punch, but were listless. Hayek's character (Rita Escobar) could have been written out of the film without much effort. She's barely a blip on the screen. This leaves the film entirely in male hands and Smith, Kline and Branagh aren't up to the task. Branagh (Dr. Arliss Loveless) has decided that the proper way to portray a madman is to speak shrilly at all times. Smith, usually energetic cocksureness, has settled into mere swagger; and Kline looks like he'd rather be kissing Tom Selleck again.The important relationship is Smith (Jim West) and Kline (Artemus Gordon). The two actors never develop any believable connection; they rarely look like they even want to be in the same scene together. With the central dramatic hook gone, WILD WILD WEST is reduced to being a formulaic action film. It still comes up short.Sonnenfeld has shot a claustrophobic movie rather than a grand adventure. Scenes, especially action scenes, are shot in extreme closeup with very quick cuts. It is, at times, impossible to decipher what's happening. Already distanced emotionally from the film, the audience is not even thrown the bone of thrilling FX.In addition, Sonnenfeld has crabbed scenes from numerous other action films; but again, he can't get them right. For example, early in the film, Jim West finds himself hanging over a cliff from a horse's bridle (see TRUE LIES). He urges the horse to ""back up"" just like Arnold; however, the suspense is ruined by the fact that he's only hanging ten feet from the ground.Much like this scene, WILD WILD WEST leaves the audience hanging. This film is boring. That is both the worst and best that one can say about it.Cavebear's Ranking for WILD WILD WEST:Quality--2: Small, listless action film. I know, that's an oxymoron.Appeal--2: It's boring.Final ranking (Q+A): 4",Wild Wild West

I always enjoyed the TV series and hoped some of the fun and excitement of it would be in the movie, but  it fell far short. It appeared to be more of a vehicle to show off Will Smith than it did to tell a story. Even such talents as Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh can't do much with the simple scraps they are thrown.

374,dynamicdavegoldberg,Poorly acted & poorly written,1,19 August 2005,"I understand that this wasn't exactly supposed to be presented as an Academy Award winning film, but it is so poorly written it makes no sense. How can you have a film set in the post Civil War era with modern 21st Century slang? It is just inexcusable and ruins the movie. The writer should have taken the time to pay attention to this type of detail.Will Smith is not believable in his character at all due to the poor dialog and his weak insincere believability in his character. Smith does not compel you with his under-dramatic acting. His poor acting and basic boredom he brings the viewer ruins any chance of the film being remotely interesting. Its bad enough that the dialog is weak and the writer is clueless about the time-line, but when your lead actor shows no passion or drive in his role, how can the film possibly mean anything at all? I recommend skipping this one.",Wild Wild West
375,alex19943953-1,Underrated and Enjoyable,9,11 February 2011,"I think this movie is highly underrated. Sure, its not as great as the TV series, which is a considered a classic in my book ( and in most peoples books as well). But the movie is nowhere near as bad as everyone keeps saying it is. Its a movie that shouldn't be taken so seriously when watching it.The CGI steampunk spider is what most people claim to have saved the movie, but i disagree.I enjoyed the movies scenes in which the spider was not present ( my favorite scene was when Loveless's steam powered tank attacked the train). In fact i almost forgot about the spider while watching the movie for the 1st time. I especially got a kick out of Kenneth Branagh's acting as Dr. Loveless.I say Loveless was the best part of the movie. But that's not to say I enjoy the use of steampunk technology. I consider this movie to be an excellent use of the Steampunk style.I do admit, the acting is a bit over the top, especially Will Smith and Kevin Kline. But i did not think it was terrible or too cheesy like everyone says it is. It is kinda silly in some way, but overall i enjoyed both of them. I do admit though, Salma Hayek's acting was weak and made her character boring. Usually, i am against movie remakes of classic TV shows, but this is one i can agree with. If it was a direct remake of the TV series with little new elements, i would not bother to watch it. So I give the producers and writers of this movie props for trying something new and different in remakes.Overall, i feel like this movie is not only underrated and enjoyable, but over-criticized. Try watching it without thinking of the TV show and of Will Smith playing James West. Whether it is better or worse, you will mostly likely have a different view on the movie than you did before.Final Verdict: 8 out of 10 I recommend this movie.",Wild Wild West
376,sloth_ian,It's really not that bad,7,24 January 2003,"Wild Wild West is not a bad film. OK, it's certainly no MIB but just because it's been made by the same people doesn't mean that it has to be judged by the same standards - they are different types of films. Will Smith is a bit limited in this film but his chemistry with Kevin Kline is great and they have some great moments together. Kenneth Branagh is wasted here but makes a decent villain whilst Salma Hayek is only going to be remembered in this film for her arse (and that's no bad thing!)I haven't seen the original series so I didn't go into the cinema expecting anything and it was a good way to pass the time. Sure it's not a classic, but in the same way it doesn't suck: it's got some great lines, a great performance from Kevin Kline and some good effects. I even like Will Smith's theme song. In the same way though, not enough time has been spent on the performances and the plot is what REALLY lets this film down.",Wild Wild West

Its not a movie like magnificent 7 because it wasn't meant to be. Its Will Smith with Kevin Kline... Its not going to be a crazy mind blowing type of movie.

The producers could have done something really great, and possibly started a movie series if they had done it right, but they didn't.The idea of casting Will Smith as James West is one of the dumbest ideas in the history of filmmaking.James West is an American James Bond in the old west, his persona is that of a rich playboy type.A black man in that role makes zero sense at all, people of that era not only have wondered what was going on, and been suspicious, but he would have had a much harder time getting accepted into many of the sort of places an agent like that would have had to operate.It makes about as much sense as casting Tom Cruz as the lead in a remake of Shaft.",Wild Wild West

It was campy and over-acted, but I think that was by design. I can see why some might consider that disrespectful to the original TV show. Outside of that, I had fun with it. I thought the 19th century manifestations of 20th century technology were amusing. And I thought Will Smith and Kevin Kline worked well together as the carefree adventurer vs. the meticulous inventor. Kenneth Branagh played the evil villain to the hilt. The voluptuous Salma Hayek was both amusing and titillating as the damsel in distress. Although politically incorrect, I thought the verbal sparring between Branagh and Smith was hilarious. I have watched this movie several times, and always enjoy it. I'm not certain why it is so venomously hated, but this being the internet, I'm sure there will be no end to the people who explain to me what an idiot I am for liking it. Knock yourselves out.

Consider the main plot elements, Will Smith, a black man, is a high ranking government official immediately following the civil war, which was fought OVER SLAVERY. Not only is there no mention of race in this incredibly and overtly racist time, but Will Smith, again a black man is given the job of protecting the president. It just doesn't make any sense, and it's disrespectful to an audience to make them try to believe this story. I am disappointed in Kenneth Branagh, who made a masterful version of Hamlet, for even being near this movie when it was being filmed. This movie is characteristic of many different things that are wrong with Hollywood, including representations of race, lack of feasible, intelligent, or original plot lines, and overall bad writing, acting and directing.

It was on Monday evening, and it was exciting to see a movie two days before the general public.  Or so I thought.  Beginning with the opening credits, which I believe must have been the longest credits known to man or beast, the movie was a huge disappointment.  ""Hi!  My name is Salma Hayek!  Can anyone out there understand why I was in this movie?"" Then there was the ""friendly"" banter between Smith's character and Branagh's.  I am not a champion of PC, but this was stupid and insulting. Everything else was just silly, not horrid, but far from good.

It is much better and more memberable than the forgettable theme they replaced it with. It the same as if you went to a Hawaii Five-0 movie and didn't hear it's classic theme song. This movie is not in the same league as MIB. It is ok but it could have been better. In this movie Loveless is a Southern loyalist who lost the bottom half of his body in the Civil War and was responsible for the Death of Jim West's parents. In the original series Loveless was a Little Person who was just evil and wanted power for him self he didn't have a political agenda that I can remember. I think much of what made the original Wild Wild West at TV Classic was lost in this translation. It is ok but not great.,Wild Wild West

Somehow, the pieces just don't click together, and the end result is a movie that's pleasant, but never quite engaging.

It lacked the action which these types of movies are expected to have, and it lacked the good writing you'd expect when action is substituted by words. Will Smith is himself minus the funny jokes, and Kevin Kline was a victim of the bad direction and the boring dialog. I kept wondering why they picked Kenneth Branagh for the role of the southern villain, and I never got my answer. There was no chemistry between the characters as none of them connected on any level. All in all, it was an incredible waste of talent (and money).The only cool thing in the movie was the giant spider robot. However, there is so much a robot can do without good programming.This is going to sound weird, but I think the music video is a lot better than the movie itself.

Sonnenfield has made very little out of a script that is very awkward and poor to begin with. There is also very few funny moments and no memorable lines from Will Smith. Even the special effects don't help the movie, it seems very out of place with action that is ridiculous in a movie that claims to be a western with its costumes and make up.

I was wrong, the acting is weak, the story is weaker. The only good thing going for the movie is the special effects, which are not even close to as good as those found in Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace. The movie did contain some humorous lines, although even those were not well delivered. All in all, this movie falls short of other Will Smith titles. 4/10",Wild Wild West

The script wasn't horrible, but I think that the theme was a little too much to support.  This movie loses its target audience as it ideally would be perfect for young kids, but perhaps the sexual content would be a bit much for them.  I found, as a more adult audience member, that the movie just didn't demand my attention or appeal to my sense of. . . anything (except for Salma being hot, of course!).  It's not a waste of money but there are too many really GOOD movies out now to catch this now.  Probably better to rent.",Wild Wild West
394,Preston-13,Mild Mild at Best,5,29 June 1999,"Went hoping for a continuation of the feel of the '60s show with the special effects of '90s... and was disappointed on both counts.  Will Smith and Kevin Kline are among my favorite actors but aren't given much in this film and they certainly don't gel as partners.  The original James West (as played by Robert Conrad) had a certain ""coolness"" about him; the Smith characterization craves center stage and craves it loudly.  Ross Martin's Artemus Gordon was humorous yet confident; Kline's is mildly amusing yet geeky.  Kenneth Branagh's character was excellent, although NOTHING like the original Loveless.The story starts off slowly and builds to a predictable, boring end. The special effects were ""OK"" but not awe-inspiring.  One thing that was kind of irritating was the addition of a racial storyline, apparently to cover for putting Smith in the lead role.  It certainly wasn't presented as realistically as it would have been in the 1860s, anyway.Your best bet is to wait for the dollar theater to see this one.",Wild Wild West

Barry Sonnenfeld, and Both Will Smith and Kevin Kline ( as well as all the other actors) do such a great job that you will feel as if you have rocketed back to 1869 on the back of a 80 foot tarantula. The visuals in the film are amazing, and the dialogue is clever and witty. Sure the animosity between the 2 heroes (Smith and Kline) seems like a cliche, but in facts its a great re-make of a fun and action filled t.v series, so you cant call it a cliche. I would think critics would appreciate the wit and cleverness of this film, but most seem to have a grudge against Summer blockbusters. So go see the film for yourself and dont listen to critics.

In the end, unusual, surprising, uneven, an unusual not that bad 'big-budget' flick.One last comment, I have to agree with other imdb-ers out there on one point, though I love mister Brannagh ('Much ado about nothing' is one fine movie !) he's absolutely awful in this movie. Well, at least, Kevin Kline, while maybe a little sub-par in this one, is quite good and Salma Hayek, well, she doesn't act that much, but for this role, does it really matter (grin).Alain",Wild Wild West

They put more money and care into the wardrobe and the look of the film than they did the script.....big mistake!!  I guess they thought with all the promotion that was done for this movie,they had another Men in Black on their hands, with all the music and product tie-ins.

And despite a talented cast, consisting of a good mix of fresh faces and proven veterans; the acting sucks. Some movies are so bad they're funny. W.W.W. is just plain bad, there's absolutely nothing funny about it. Basically, this is one of those movies that's just a pain to sit through.

407,reelbigfishfan,Biased review,7,17 July 2020,"I personally love this movie. I watched it as a kid and hold it close to my heart. That being said, it is a good action comedy. It's the pinnacle of 90's action comedys but with a period twist. The story is cohesive, and I did find myself enjoying the hell out it upon rewatching. It's not the best movie but I do believe it is not by any means, bad. What else can you say, it's a 90's action comedy and hits all the 90s action comedy points. If you havent seen it, I suggest watching it at least one time, but as i said it does not have the potential to be anyone's favorite movie but is still worth watching.",Wild Wild West
408,will2488,good but could've been much better,6,22 March 2007,"I've read several reviews on this film, and all say that it was horrible, but with this sort of film it's not meant to be taken as seriously as it was, it has some good moments, however the bit I found most annoying with this film was Selma Hayek's' continuous ""oh he's so"" when referring to Jim West (will smith) it was tedious, it could've been so much funnier (and less annoying) just near the end she could said ""impetuous, courageous, and graceful, all he needs now is patience and he's the perfect man"" this would've been a lot more funnier. This film was good but could've been better, however it is one of those films that I class as good mindless fun, and should not be taken as seriously as some did.",Wild Wild West
409,amscray,OH DEAR.,1,27 November 2001,"Ignore anyone who tells you to not watch this movie. Seriously - ignore them - you want to watch the first three minutes - the 'jacuzzi scene'. Then you want to turn off the TV, throw the video in the bin, tear the cinema screen from the wall, kick in the speaker cones, scream, shout, attack the cinema usher. Anything but watch the rest of this god-awful movie.You will see over an hour and a half of stupid looking trains with copper cauldrons fixed to every wall, complete with buttons, levers and nobs which have no place on my screen. You will tire of them quickly and if you have any sense, you will do as I did, and make this THE FIRST AND ONLY MOVIE YOU EVER TURNED OFF ON PURPOSE BECAUSE IT SUCKS.",Wild Wild West
410,wheelsakman,Flat Out Horrible. Will Smith Is OVERRATTED!!!,1,1 August 2002,"This film is just bad.  The TV show was decent for its time.  But the two had a lot in common.  NONE of the stuff they did was physically possible. If you want to make a fantasy movie fine, leave real people out of it like President U.S. Grant.  Why anyone thinks Will Smith is talented is nuts! He is horrible!",Wild Wild West
411,HeXetic,Not really as bad as many say,7,18 March 2003,"I rented this on tape and honestly it wasn't as bad as so many people told me it would be. Maybe it was just that, being a Blockbuster rental, it was cheaper and more comfortable to watch it at home, but my younger sister and I were generally amused by the show. One might call it a ""less good"" version of Men In Black, set in a parody of the old American West featuring technology out of a Jules Verne novel.",Wild Wild West
412,bumbl3bee,better than i thought,7,5 January 2004,well i never saw this movie when it came out. didn't even like it - even before it came out. well now 4-5 years later i finally saw it. and liked it! not a brilliant movie - but a movie that did what it set out to do. to be entertaining. a typical popcorn movie. an action/adventure that doesn't take itself too seriously. i had a fun time watching it.,Wild Wild West
413,jackthetormented,The collective stick...,6,5 May 2012,"Well, while not the greatest movie of all time, I found enough to be entertaining. Never saw the original television series. Movies are made to entertain. You can bash every movie for faults but what you should really be judging is whether it was entertaining or not.And so, I say this was entertaining. The special effects were fun and the villain really felt like a classic super-villain, insane but brilliant. You really wouldn't like the movie if you were looking for something intellectually stimulating but is good for a laugh even if you are generally laughing at the movie.Personally, I think most critics and most people in general have a rather large stick up their collective asses looking for perfection.It's not perfect but fun at least. Thanks.",Wild Wild West
414,payners1993,Brilliant,9,31 March 2013,"I really don't know why this film has such a low rating, I think a lot of it may be people taking it as a serious western instead of just appreciating it as a silly movie that is genuinely hilarious. I think a lot of people also compare it to the TV series instead of just appreciating the movie.Will Smith is brilliant in it as is Kevin Kline and I still watch this when it is on TV now because of how enjoyable I find this film.Says has to be 10 lines so I'm currently making sure this is 10 lines which is why I have put this. I apologize for you reading this I know you probably are really annoyed now.",Wild Wild West
415,ghost-heart,Blockbuster Western Comedy At It's Finest!!!,10,7 August 2021,"I watched this movie growing up in the 90s snd I still find this movie absolute gold! There's no movie like it on the market, especially in 2021! If you want a good laugh this is the movie! I can't get enough of this comedy gold! I'm not happy by the bad reviews from Rotten Tomatoes & other stick up the butt Critics that probably watched this movie thinking it was supposed to be a real representation of the west, when it's is own unique world. Will Smith & other actrors/actresses were absolutely on fire in this! 🔥💯🔥 You couldn't get away with saying some stuff in today's society, and that's another reason this is gold era comedy. I appreciate the humor & love how well they made this movie really look like a blockbuster western comedy. They just don't make comedy this good anymore. Watch this if you have excellent taste in comedy, you won't be disappointed!",Wild Wild West
416,geneel,Very Entertaining,10,10 August 2005,"This movie is one of my favorites. I have my own copy of this movie. I have watched it several times and it is a very entertaining action/comedy/fantasy. I thoroughly enjoyed it. If you have not seen it, I recommend seeing it. Don't watch the broadcast version because they edit out some of the scenes and details that make this movie great and flow.This movie version adds it's own style and favor to the concept originated in the TV series and can stand on its own merit. The story and dialog is clever, well written and flows well.The chemistry between Will Smith , Kevin Cline, and Kenneth Branaugh was good. In fact the entire casting was well selected and the interaction worked. I liked the fake Victorian hi tech gadgets such as the steam powered wheelchair used by Dr. Loveless, the internal combustion powered bicycle, the custom train coach with all of it's gadgets, the bicycle flying machine, the tank, Dr. Loveless'weapon of mass destruction, Artemis Gordon's spur powered grinding machine and his numerous other inventions and disguises, to name a few. Costumes, makeup, and sets were excellent.",Wild Wild West
417,mappciti,Unbelievable,10,30 June 2005,"When I first heard this I was amazed and sad for Will Smith. You may have heard this before but Will Smith turned down the part of Neo in The Matrix to play Jim West. Horrible decision. It's one that would haunt me for the rest of my life if I were him. Granted, reading the script he was probably like ""what the hell,"" but after the success of the trilogy and the 'blah' of Wild Wild West , he's probably upset and heartbroken. He's a very successful actor now, but imagine if he had chosen to do The Matrix instead. He would have perfected that part in ways that Keanu Reeves couldn't, the movie would have been that much better. Besides, the character of Neo would have just been much cooler considering Will Smith's and Keanu Reeves' places on the ""cool scale.""",Wild Wild West
418,peaceleste17,It's a good movie.,9,19 January 2020,"The poor reviews are puzzling- did we watch the same film? This is, after all, a comedic action flick starring 90's Will Smith and Kevin Klein. At no point in time does my attention waiver. From the chuckle worthy innuendoes, to the outrageous props, hairdos and costumes, I find it to be close to perfection. Not to mention, Smith's iconic Wild West song!Those of you who gave the film less than 4 stars take movies too seriously. Live a little.",Wild Wild West
419,wyllow61,A Great Romp!,10,9 January 2012,"If you loved the original TV series, then you will like this film. I am surprised at all the negative reviews of this little gem. I loved it! The chemistry between the characters is outstanding, the witty banter fun, and the ridiculousness of the sci-fi style inventions completely captures the tone of the original show. It isn't meant to be a serious film! The cinematography is well done, quite the homage to the genre, and the goofy half-man bad guy is perfect! The pace is fast and keeps your attention. It is a MUCH better film that the boring recent release Cowboys and Aliens. That was a dud. Wild Wild West is lively adventure that is completely enjoyable! It is a fun film. Those who hate it have either never seen the original TV show (or have and didn't get it) or they have lost touch with their inner child.",Wild Wild West
420,gmatgerlich,Totally underrated movie,8,7 February 2021,"I seriously don't understand the amount of negative publicity this movie gets, even from Will Smith himself! Of course it's not meant to be a major Oscar winning film. It's meant to be a family fun adventure which it definitely is. Set in the late 1800's post civil war when President Grant was in office, it has some futuristic inventions that of course never became made, but it's a movie people! I absolutely loved the different pool balls that had different features and most importantly, the giant spider! Ok, maybe the spider was a little cheesy. I still have to give this film a high 8/10 when rating it. This is just one you can't go into expecting A+ performances from the cast. Definitely one of my childhood favorites.Side note: Around the time this came out, Dreyers Ice Cream made a Wild Wild West themed ice cream that was one of the best I've ever had! It was basically just a chocolate and vanilla with caramel swirls and little chocolate pieces filled with more caramel. But if you were a kid in the 90s, you definitely remember this one.",Wild Wild West
421,cristynail,Love this movie,10,31 July 2018,"I absolutely love this movie. It was funny and i love who they picked for the two star roles. I love the villain too, you can also find him in a harry potter movie.",Wild Wild West
422,renebird,Movie's not that easy. But at least it has good song work.,6,28 October 2019,"Well, at least they've got 2 great songs at the end, besides the soundtrack being the bestselling.",Wild Wild West
423,ShadowPC,"Smith good, West Bad",2,5 July 1999,"Well, I saw the 2nd big hyped movie of the summer... the 1st being Star Wars (which I have seen 5 times).  Wild Wild West however, I will NEVER see again.  Let me say, Will Smith did a fine job, however, he had nothing to work with.  All WWW is, is special effects and T&A, with a few cool lines from Will.  Everything else, down the drain stink.",Wild Wild West
424,Jeremy-7,Another summer blockbuster misfire.,6,29 June 1999,"Wild Wild West is a visually stunning film, from Michael Ballhaus's photography to Bo Welch's production design.  And it has a very talented cast.  Too bad such time and creative effort was wasted on a script that lacks narrative complexity and substance and contemporary humor that feels out of place, making it an easily forgettable movie going experience.",Wild Wild West
425,Sterling-5,Disappointing Film. The Actors were Bored.,5,2 July 1999,"DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE! This movie is not SO completely terrible that theatres should be torched and writers and director and actors to be hung. But it wasn't good. It could have been so much better. If you were expecting ""Men in Black"" in the old west, you can just get that thought out of your head. ""West"" has all of the effects, but half of the wit and interest of the former.Lets start with the bad news. Will Smith (James West) and Kevin Kline (Artemus Gordon) have neglible chemistry. For as much as they bicker, you could get the feeling that the actors did the scenes by individually, and computers were used to place them together in the scene. In fact, the partnership as played by Smith and Kline seemed forced. Forced dislike; Forced tolerance; Forced friendship.Ironically, there's better chemistry between Smith and Kenneth Branagh (Arliss Loveless). As adversaries, they bounce off well together. All of the best scenes in the movie involve these two together. Anyway, Branagh seems to inhabit his character the best. Loveless seems to fit best in this obviously insane world of the movie. He's not real and THAT'S THE POINT. THIS IS A COMEDY. GO OVER THE TOP!Also, did you have the impression that Salma Hayek (Rita Escobar) would have a role in this film? I thought so too! Her entire role consisted of her commenting, ""He is soo. . . [insert adjective here]"" when Smith would do something. If you hire Salma Hayek, LET HER ACT. GIVE HER A PART IN WHICH SHE CAN ACT.Anyway, this film is not all bad. There were several good scenes involving all of the characters. Kline is engaging when he finally gets fed up with West. Will still has his charm and sarcastic retorts. Hayek is still adorable. It's just that Salma doesn't have anything to do; Kline is TOO reserved for the good of the movie; Smith only gets to react to Branagh.In summary, the movie doesn't work because there is nothing for the characters to react to. Notice I didn't even mention the special effects. They can't save the movie. There's a slim chance that the movie can ride on Will's charm or Branagh's silliness. But it isn't likely.",Wild Wild West
426,GotRice,Easily the worst over hyped summer movie ever,3,1 July 1999,"Never has the West appeared so cheesy and insipid.  Wild Wild West wasn't believable and for a movie of it's kind it wasn't entertaining. First of all the paper-thin plot involved some General Loveless and his giant spider machine kidnapping the president so he could take over the United States. The machinery and Will Smith as a cowboy seemed all out of place in the 1870's southwestern setting.  And worse, except for a few jokes the movie wasn't funny.  Kevin Kline and Will Smith as women were just plain revolting. The good actors, decent directing, and art direction couldn't even save this Godzilla-sized stinker.",Wild Wild West
427,funken,Really Really Bad,5,5 July 1999,"I like Will Smith alot.  But I can't believe that he agreed to do this movie.  This had to be one the Worst movie's that I've seen in a long time. Klein and Smith are both great actor's, but you would have never known that from this movie.  This movie was supposed to have great special effect's. The only effect's that I saw was some stupid metal spider.  I guess the hype was way to high on this movie and sorry to say it did not live up to the hype.",Wild Wild West
428,René Glas,"the western is dead, long live the western",7,30 June 1999,"Hiding behind a buddy-movie cover, this film is actually all about Will Smith, Kevin Kline is reduced to a funny side-kick instead of a full lead. Not that it is a big problem though, Smith has enough power and charisma to carry the weight of the whole movie. The most interesting part of this movie is the art direction. The excellent sets and incredible gadgets (an 80-feet tall tarantula) are all designed in a Jules-Verne kind-a look. Instead of looking like an ordinary Western, WILD WILD WEST is a refreshing mixture of nineties' science-fiction, adventure and humor.",Wild Wild West
429,Doc-110,Mild Mild West,1,2 July 1999,"I didn't spend a penny to see Wild Wild West and still thought I'd been robbed.  I could have re-watched any of a number of good to great movies already in release, but I chose to spend (waste) two hours waiting for Wil Smith to start acting.  If you must see this movie, at least make someone else buy your ticket.",Wild Wild West
430,Patrick Damsted,Probably the worst film this year!?,1,28 July 1999,"My expectations were none so disappointment can´t be the reason.The story stinks, the actors aren´t acting, and - worst of all, the effects are so badly done my toes crumbled in my shoes. I haven´t seen so badly done chroma-key since the weathercasts in 1978 - has Hollywood run out of money? - or was the blind guy who operated the machines that day?After a very poor opening sequence it just goes downhill from there. Luckily the choice of Bernstein gives the picture the music it deserves, boring music. If i wasn´t because i sat next to a lovely blonde i would have left the cinema.",Wild Wild West
431,Big guy-7,A god western comedy for most of the family!,7,3 July 1999,"I personally don't like anything that has to do with cowboys,horses,and anything to do with the west,but the person who wrote the script for Wild Wild West made me change my mind. I admit it wasn't the best movie that I've seen,but it certainly wasn't the worst.My family and I went to the theaters and saw W.W.W. and each of us had our own opinions about the movie,but each of us agreed it would be a Good Western Comedy For Most Of The Family!(probably ages 13+)",Wild Wild West
432,elp086,"One of this year's best hyped, worst movies.",1,7 July 1999,"I was very excited to see WWW, but when I accually saw it, I was very disappointed. Lots of unnecessary scenes and lots of unnecessary words, but what really killed the movie for me was the shots in the Oval Office where you could see the boom microphone hanging from the celing. Shouldn't that have been edited out. That was six bucks I wish I still had.",Wild Wild West
433,silntbob-2,Mild Mild west,5,2 July 1999,"This movie had so many things that were wrong with it that I don't think it is possible to put them all in a review like this.  First off the graphics and special effects were just rank.  The green screening in this movie was so apparent that when the scene with Will smith and Kevin Kline walking in the desert came about anyone who knew anything in the theater laughed.  The fight scenes were cheesy and fake looking, and many didn't make much since or were pointless, watch for the scene with the paintings.  The jokes in this movie were funny I must admit however many were very mean toward blacks and the handicapped.  I could go on but I'll end this by asking what was with the iron guy?",Wild Wild West
434,RandW,There is a reason this was a TV show.,1,19 July 1999,"This is yet another example of why Hollywood should leave TV shows where they belong.This was one of the worst movies in a long line of bad remakes of TV shows.When Wild,Wild West was on TV,it was an original idea.That was the charm of it in the 60's.Today,as a movie,the makers of this trash thought that by starring Wil Smith and adding alot of FX,that they would have a good show.WAKE UP PEOPLE,we also want a good story.I would also like to see the use of all the actors in your movie.Selma Hayek was used so little,it was a miracle that they even listed her in the credits.My only hope is that we will not have another chapter in this bad series made even though this one will no doubt reach the $100 million mark.",Wild Wild West
435,shapel,The Horror!!!,1,21 August 1999,"When I decided to go see the movie, I was sure I wouldn't suffer too much, because I didn't set my hopes very high in the first place. I was wrong. The plot was downright insulting. Anyone with a vague understanding of history of technology, war, or anything else would notice how things that no one thought of until WWI were invented in 1869 by a bored genius (who, for some reason, seems very very stupid when he speaks). And, of course, the black military hero in the mid 1800s. I have nothing to add to that. I read a viewer's comment claiming that Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh did a good job, but were limited by, well, everything else. They did not do a good job. They were in the movie. I'm not even going to talk about the characters and acting, and more than enough has been said about the special effects. The movie is just plain bad! And, to top it all off, the rest of the audience was aged, in average, 11, and so every time the plot went anywhere close to romantic (and they almost never got any closer than those horrendously written word games), the entire audience yelled in disgust. They were also the ones responsible for the inch of Coke on the floor, to complete my movie-going experience.",Wild Wild West
436,jbond-6,"bad , very bad movie",1,6 July 1999,the wild wild west continues the tradition of yearly summer action flops . with 1997's Batman & Robin and 1998's Avengers. this movie is yet another example why television shows don't make good movies . sooner or later hollywood will learn from it's mistakes.like we did paying $8.00 to see this horrible movie,Wild Wild West
437,btrosko,Astoundingly bad.,1,3 July 1999,"My God, was this a bad film.  Bad plot, awful writing, horrible supporting acting.  This film brings the word ""bad"" to stupefyingly new levels of badness.Maybe it wasn't that bad, but Lord, it wasn't good.  Plot devices are arbitrarily devised, and then discarded when inconvenient.  Supposedly smart characters act stupidly.  The conflict between the Kline and Smith characters feels totally contrived and needless.  Most damning of all, this movie tries to be something of a comedy, but takes itself far too seriously to pull it off.To put it another way, a decent concept with much potential, but irrevocably ruined by the worst writing I can remember witnessing.  Even Salma Hayek's buttock shot fails to move this movie to even a mediocre level.  Stay away. If you really want to waste 7 bucks, go buy lottery tickets.",Wild Wild West
438,Fulcrum-4,Wild Wild West of Time more like,1,14 August 1999,"I wouldn't waste your time and hard earned cash to watch this film. Which will no doubt turn into a big budget summer flop, just like ""The Avengers"" last year. I work at my local cinema and viewed it after finishing a shift, and I wish I'd just gone home instead.The actors in it all deserve better scripts and more in-depth characters. Although there are a few comic moments, and the special effects (which aren't particularly that good), it is not enough to make the film watchable. Personally I would stick to watching the music video which is much better.",Wild Wild West
439,TwitteR-2,Wild Wild Waste.....I don't think so.,7,5 July 1999,"This movie has had a terrible time getting good reviews, but I think it was a great movie. It has lots of great one liners, Will Smith and Kevin Kline are fantastic together. Granted the plot left something to be desired but as a whole it was a cool movie. I would say it's worth the money to see it.",Wild Wild West
440,(esq),Pointless and awful,1,4 July 1999,"I'm not sure if anything short of burning the negatives could improve this film.  A plotless mess that exists it some sort of limbo-history, where impossible and dull machines slog across a computer generated West (though most of the movie seems to happen in Washington or Louisiana).  Oh, and there are some actors, though I hope no one involved keeps this one on their resume.  Kevin Kline is wasted, Will Smith is uninteresting, Selma Hayek is tacked on, and Kenneth Branagh is shrill.  Pointlessly crude, this is a film that should not have been made as it pales before the original series, or even a napkin with the words ""Quality"" on it.",Wild Wild West
441,Zach-21,"Viewers beware, wait till video",5,3 July 1999,"Let me be frank, I hated this movie.  This movie has historical errors that will make your head hurt.  The computer generated effects seemed out of place in the 1869 setting.  The love triangle is underdeveloped, pointless, and stupid.  The character development( what little there is) comes straight out of Screenwriting 101.I once read that star Kevin Kline thought the script for WWW was the worst he had ever read.  I'm afraid he's right.",Wild Wild West
442,JMA99,Authenticity doesn't seem to be needed in the '90s.,4,8 July 1999,"Greatest train ever built; Kevin Kline's a dazzler in every movie he stars in, and its a stitch to see a noted Brit, playing a Southern Gentleman/villain.  But somewhere, somehow the authors seemed to have lost their sanity and tried to combine the authentic wild west with some cockamamie spider machine. And who's the Bozo that figured a battery-driven wheel chair wouldn't look entirely out of place?  Don't the studios do their ""preview screenings"" anymore?  It tried to please the children as much as adults and I believe it got all of us very confused. But a good candidate for Video.",Wild Wild West
443,the-beast,Great adaptation of a good TV show,9,1 July 1999,"True to the spirit of the original TV show, the movie was not just a ""turn the crank"" remake.  Will Smith's Jim West is distinct from the original (and no, not just because of the color of his skin), but still a blast.  I predict that some will argue that it's the exact same character we saw in MIB, Independence Day, and Fresh Prince, and I'd have to agree.  But, call me small minded, I *like* that character, especially in an over the top fantasy like this.My only regret is that the all the fantastic special effects were shown in the commercials.  As with the Phantom Menace trailer, by the time I saw the movie I already had seen all the eye candy.  Wild Wild West's comedy carried the show anyways.",Wild Wild West
444,aciDJack,Just another Will Smith movie.,4,2 July 1999,"I found this movie amazingly dry, despite obvious attempts to be cute and funny.  It carried on and on, without making much headway.  The character Jim West didn't gain a whole lot of sympathy from me, and the story was highly unrealistic.  Although that was the point, the clash of imagination and history was too awful to bare without grimacing.  Even the special effects could have been better, and you could often tell when a blue screen was being used.  4/10 stars",Wild Wild West
445,lg347697,Horrible!,2,9 July 1999,The only reason I saw this movie is because it was a double feature running with Austin Powers. This was the biggest waste of time. The plot (I had to search to find one) and the dialogue were horrible. I felt embarrassed for the audience when they laughed at Will Smith's fake humor. I expected the horrible role and acting from Will Smith but not from Kevin Kline. This is 90 minutes I wish I could have back.,Wild Wild West
446,Dawstaw,Overkill,2,7 July 1999,"Will Smith and Kevin Kline are terrific in this movie. Kenneth Branagh is a marvelous actor as well, but this was not his venue.  I thought his talent was wasted here ... and the plot could have been moved along just as well without the overdone southern accent and the ""colorized"" one-liners.  M. Emmett Walsh was great in his role.",Wild Wild West
447,Fuji-3,don't take this movie too seriously,9,4 July 1999,If you don't take this movie too seriously you will enjoy it a great deal.It takes you on a fanciful flight through an unlikely Wild West following the adventures of Jim West (Will Smith) and Artemus Gordon (Kevin Kline). Kenneth Branagh's Dr. Loveless is truly an evil genius. I found the story to be kinda like Gunsmoke meets Star Wars. The action is fairly fast paced and doesn't get too bogged down anywhere. Definitely on my 'A' List for recommended summer viewing.,Wild Wild West
448,sandman-47,"Wait for video or better yet, HBO.",4,4 July 1999,"Weak Weak Plot.I must be one of the tasteless that BadBoy-11 wrote of.I'll agree that Will Smith is funny. Not as funny as MiB or Bad Boys, but he is entertaining. Kenneth Branagh's character, Arliss Loveless, is probably the most interesting but then only because Branagh is a Brit. His southern drawl was quite good. Almost made me forget that this is the same man that portrayed Henry V. (If you have any taste at all, rent that one.)It's a silly movie. Save your money and watch it on cable. This dog should be there before Christmas.",Wild Wild West
449,Mountain-6,It is as bad as the reviews,1,5 July 1999,"I had read something on Internet Movie Data Base saying that WWW was ""not as bad as the reviews"" ..... well, all through the movie, I kept waiting for it to get ""not as bad as the reviews"" and I never found it ..... it is one of the few movies I felt like leaving, and felt like the price of admission during a matinee was too much .....For me.... I just cannot suspend disbelief to the point of seeing stuff that is impossible to be built today with todays technologies being built like they were nothing in 1869 .....  it is like throwing out every law of physics and science ..... but then pasting a few things in to try and make it look real .....There was just so many impossible things done in that movie that are just impossible ... I like Science-fiction .... heck, I like fantasy movies.... You can invent all kinds of unrealistic stuff and I'll suspend disbelief forever... and like the made up stuff and enjoy the movie .....But this was absurd, and they tried to pass it off as feasible .... (which is my only real problem with the movie) ......For the record, I am a Will Smith fan, and I liked Men In Black (some connection with MiB and WWW) ...... but in MiB, the technologies came from elsewhere (and were just as ridiculous) .... but I can buy it ..... unlike this movie trying to pass of things that are totally ludicrous.",Wild Wild West
450,fuzzyb,Wild Wild Worst,3,5 July 1999,"This movie was so boring I registered just so I could comment. I am a fan of the old TV show and had watched a few episodes recently. The movie only borrows the names & concept from the series, but none of the charm.The film version has so much sexual innuendo that it became tiring. The background score was uninspiring. They could have used the score from the TV series and updated it, but instead they chose a very weak composition that kept repeating itself. I can remember only once where the original music from the TV series was even used at all.At first I thought that this movie might have been miscast. A black secret agent in the 1860's? The movie does an adequate job of using race as a plot element, but I would have preferred that color had been ignored. Considering that the hero was black, I don't feel that they did a good enough job explaining how he was in such high regard of the president.I have enjoyed Will Smith & Kevin Kline in other movies. I don't think that this movie will do anything to hurt their careers, but it won't do anything to further them either.In a world where everything old needs to be remade again, I wish that this remake hadn't been done.If you like the TV series, wait for video to watch this one.",Wild Wild West

Just the other day i was watching Oprah and i knew that what i was going to see was no ordinary film. I can confirm that Kevin Kline is indeed less humoristic than Will Smith in this picture, but if it were up to me it would be a great hit in Holland.It plays itself in a great time out in the west. I think you should give great pleasure in the first scene where Will(james West) Smith is making Love to a beautiful young Lady in a Watertank that was used to refill trains with water. He made sure that there is a lot of comedy in this film so go and enjoy it.",Wild Wild West
453,Wulf-5,Not a film I'd recommend,2,14 August 1999,"I was quite keen on going to see 'Wild Wild West' the first time I saw the trailer but a bit more dubious after a second viewing.  However, I still dragged myself out when it hit the local cinema yesterday afternoon and was glad I did ... if only to be able to warn you not to bother.I enjoyed a few things about the film.  There were some good jokes and visual gags, and a bunch of fascinating 'steampunk' inventions.Unfortunately, apart from a few highlights, it seemed as if the script was an early draft rather than a polished product, and the plot was left limping from set piece to set piece.  What really left a sour taste in my mouth was the inclusion of a significant number of offensive jokes.  I didn't think it was justifiable for the black hero and the disabled villain to tear verbal shreds off each other with a succession of cheap puns.  Bearing in mind the predominantly young audience of the film, this seemed very irresponsible.I suppose the bottom line for me was that I was hoping for an entertaining film of the same calibre as 'Men in Black'.  I was disappointed and, particularly in view of the prejudicial jokes, I would suggest that you look to see what else is showing before paying your pennies for a dose of 'Wild Wild West'.",Wild Wild West

I think I laughed once, and chuckled a couple of times, at most. A James Bond spoof as the director claims? You must be joking! An action adventure? Only if you like your plots ludicrous! A western? Hardly. A new genre? I can't see anyone else following in this diabolical film's footsteps.The special effects might have been clever but they were also bizarre and stupid. Kenneth Branagh's performance was so over the top it was laughable (but not in a comedy type of way). I couldn't wait for it to end.

I was saddened by the fact that I found neither.  I had heard many people come away from this movie disgruntled that they had wasted not only $7 to go see it but they had lost 100 or so minutes of valuable time from their lives.  There are much better things to do with your life such as getting that all important root canal work done (without painkillers).  This pathetic attempt at grabbing a familiar title (from the classic TV show) throwing in a couple of big name actors and adding a few fire works just to rake in a quick $100 million is not only insulting to those who endured this rubbish but it is a terrible waste of two talented actors.  Of course what's more pathetic, the fact that Barry Sonnenfeld made this movie or that enough people had nothing better to do with 2 hours of their time than to sit through this drivel.Not only was the humor void of any substance but by the time you realized that they were trying to make a joke it left you with more of a groan than a chuckle.  And the only half way interesting story line (the one between Salma Hayek and her kidnapped father/husband....whatever!) was barely mentioned as a point of reference before it was buried deep within this abysmal quagmire.

By the way, Will Smith is one of my favorite actors and singers. I especially like him when he's making faces, but this is not the main thing why I like him. He's a real actor. He's got a gift. P S I saw an interview with W. Smith some days ago. He explained how did he react when he was attacked by a criminal. I loved it a lot.

Brian Orndorf (or OrnDORK) and a lot of other people may not have liked it, but there are a lot more who like it, or just as much who like it. This is one good movie that you probably will enjoy, unless you don't like Will Smith or the story.P.S.: What was Brian Orndorf thinking. His lies about this being the worst in the summer may hurt Barry Sonnenfeld or Will Smith's feelings. Sonnenfeld tried his best to do this, so this Orndorf shouldn't have been so mean.

The actors Robert Conrad and Ross Martin really made the show great. They are irreplaceable. Both Will Smith and Kevin Kline are great actors, but they are not West and Gordon...sorry.Replacing Robert Conrad with Will Smith is like replacing Sean Connery with George Lazenby as James Bond.

Storyline is fine and special effect was well done by 1999 standard, it just a typical summer blockbuster that come out every year.Will Smith is charming as always in this film and Kenneth Branagh did a great job portraying the main villain.

I cannot believe that you bother to write in-depth reviews on such a light entertainment film. You all sound so pseudo! Who are you kidding? Will Smith had some bad lines in the film, yes, but delivered in his own inimitable way, he gets away with it. Salma Hayek was a very pleasurable diversion in the film, even though there was no real reason for her being there. Who cares? All big budget films have a beautiful young lady in the plot somewhere.

473,xie-zilong0812,west,7,29 November 2011,"Wild Wild West (1999) is an action western comedy American movie. The story is happened after the civil war, this movie talks about that the intelligence agent James west is a smart and suave romantic cowboy sheriff and Gordon is good at dressing and proficient in various organ, which they are following the order to arrest the ulterior motive strange Dr. Lefolisi. Lefolisi wants to use the strange giant mechanical spider to attempt to assassinate U.S President. At first West and Gordon dislike each other, but soon they become close co-operation and mutual trust. The two main characters after untold hardships, during the movie there has humor, romance, and many strange weapons and fight scenes, so the west and Gordon's mission is full of adventure and excitement. This movie is a classical American heroism movie. James west is traditional cowboy, but Gordon is a modern agent. The movie's background is after the civil war, everything is becoming new. The old and new, black people and white people, traditional and technology are striking contrast. In this movie we can see the special American west scenery. There has the high mountain, wide desert, sparsely wooded and desolate. The people who live in west, they are natural and gallant. James west is a classical example. He is strong; his body is full of muscle and power. He is good looking and romantic, he is so popular in girls but he is never stable. He is smart, brave and humor; he can complete any impossible mission by himself; his behavior looks crazy but every time he is lucky. Of course in this movie has a bad guy. At first bad guy is stronger than good people and always win. Bad guy often has so many men, and good guy has to fight with so many people. At last always good guy win. I like this movie, it is not only talk about hero and west, but also show the scenery at that time. On the movie has a train. This train is a clues runs through all story. In fact this train is a real antique train in the world.",Wild Wild West

I loved all of Gordon's inventions and how funny it was to see both him and West try to get Rita to fall for them. Also, Loveless was such a good bad guy! He was just so.....grossly self-absorbed in an evil genius sort of way. Loved all the 'technology' and the jokes. If you ignore the fact that this could never happen and that some people thought it to be a 'flop' then it turns out to be a really great adventure, a fun getaway from the monotony of the everyday. plus i really thought they chose good people for the cast, Kevin Kline, Will Smith, Kenneth Branagh, and selma Hayek all did great.

477,kphillips2,Lame social statement,2,24 August 2006,I was a big fan of the TV series and like most people who went to see the movie I tried to keep an open mind. The film falls short in so many area that not even the special effects can save it. The race card is played as a statement to the social injustices of the time. We are all aware of the how poorly blacks were treated during this time period. We don't need it driven home while we are in the entertainment mode. It's a bad idea all around. Will Smith offers some comic relief to the otherwise sad statement but at times seems to try to hard. I would bet he even found the script a drag. The movie is played on cable from time to time.

Adam West is Batman, KFC is Kentucky Fried Chicken, and no one will ever convince me that Will Smith is James West.That being said, as long as you don't try and tie the series and this movie together, it works. If it wasn't for Kevin Klein, this movie would fall flat. But Smith's West blends well into Klein's Gordon and the duo works. It's a fun, easy going James Bond/48 Hrs/Lethal Weapon flick.A few disappointments however, including Arliss Loveless. The late Michael Dunn was a genius as Miguelito Loveless. Had any other actor portrayed that character, it wouldn't have worked. This is what happened with Arliss. There was enough Miguelito to try and make the characters similar, but without Michael Dunn (heaven doesn't give shore leave) it just won't fly. A completely new villain would have been a much better choice.As much as I enjoyed this movie, however...I am happy to see they never made a sequel. This was a one hit wonder.

Also magnets only behave like those ones around the heroes necks in cartoons.I never recognized Kenneth Branagh but was shocked when I found he was in this film.

Could he be the rare action star that avoided colossal missteps and simply continued to make money with charming roles of just cool semi-rebels? No.Wild, Wild West assuaged any idea that he was bulletproof. It demolished the idea of a flawless big weekend star. It savagely beat the notion of Mr. Smith being money in the bank.

The thing that makes it worse is that they have all done good work in the past that is good but here they don't even seem to be trying.Then there is the direction. Has there ever been a more incompetent director than Berry Summerfield? The ""Plot"" is just awful.Doctor Loveless(who in the TV show was a great character with Richard Keel as a henchman)is now a guy in a wheelchair who wants to use a gaint robot spider(That there is no way he could build in the 1860s)to kidnap the President and take over the west. Never mind that the ONE spider can only be in ONE place at once and that all you would have to do to stop it would be shoot it with a buch of cannons and that the vice president would take over for him and Grant would not be able to surrender to him,this is a Will Smith Movie.Don't even get me started on the cross dressing scene.Every piece of ""plot"" just leads to a mindless scene that is only there so that Warner Brothers can show you that they know what CGI is.In short this is the worst movie I have ever seen,and it makes the Awful Men in Black 2 look like a classic.I can't believe this made more money than the Classic South park movie on it opening weekend.",Wild Wild West

The draw of this film for me is the way in which the people react to these mechanical creations; because it is set in a time when mechanics were quite rare it is fun to see how inventive the designers have to be. I think Will Smith and Kevin Kline have an amazing on screen inter-action with each other, scenes that are mostly conversation are kept entertaining by their delivery of some great lines. I have seen this film many times and seriously recommend it to anybody who would ""like"" to see Kevin Kline in a dress.",Wild Wild West
494,MikeCooke,History,1,26 August 2005,"I guess History meant nothing to the film makers. There were a few moments when history tried to peek through. But all realism was tossed away when the character played in the original series was made into a black male. During that time in history there was no chance of the first secret service agent being black. Therefore revisionist history wins and I give the movie two thumbs down....way down. The special effects were awful as well and it could of used some better writers. I hope they never make a sequel to this awful movie. It would have been more believable and I think entertaining if they didn't try to put so much futuristic garbage into the movie and just work with what would have been available at the time. There were many things that could have been used to spice up the movie but I don't have all day. I bet Will Smith in 20 years will say ""I can't believe I made that movie, What was I thinking?""",Wild Wild West
495,lallhans,Just chill and don't take it serious because it isn't meant to be,8,3 November 2017,"I really can't stand all these wanna be critics anymore complaining about how Hollywood screws up classics but then up rate movies like 2017 ""The Mummy"" because it's different. Just chill and enjoy it because it's hilarious. And please ignore my at some points bad English. I am German so deal with it.",Wild Wild West
