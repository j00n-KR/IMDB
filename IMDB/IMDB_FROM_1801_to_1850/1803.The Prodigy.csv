0,claudio_carvalho,Evil Reincarnation,6,15 May 2020,"In Ohio, police officers kill the serial-killer Edward Scarka (Paul Fauteux), when one of his victims flees from him and discloses his hideout in a farmhouse. Fifteen minutes later in Pennsylvania, Sarah Blume (Taylor Schilling) delivers her son Miles Blume (Jackson Robert Scott). Soon Miles becomes the pride and joy of Sarah and her husband John Blume (Peter Mooney) with his intelligence. When Miles is eight years old, his parents note his aggressive behavior and Sarah records his words during a nightmare. She brings Miles to the psychiatrist Dr. Elaine Strasser (Paula Boudreau) that shows the tape to Dr. Arthur Jacobson (Colm Feore), who is specialist in reincarnation. Soon he concludes that Miles is possessed by an evil entity and may lose his soul. What will Sarah and John do?""The Prodigy"" is a predictable horror movie with a story of a child possessed by an evil reincarnation. Despite the well-known theme, the screenplay is not bad and keep the attention of the viewer. Therefore, it is worthwhile watching this film with lower expectation and the viewer may have a surprise. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Maligno"" (""Malign"")",The Prodigy
1,nogodnomasters,He's in here,6,15 March 2019,"Miles (Jackson Robert Scott) is a child prodigy or ""smarty-pants"" to use the film technical term. We discover early that he is the reincarnation of Edward the serial killer (Paul Fauteux) who was shot and killed minutes before Miles was born. Edward is back to kill the one that got away and it isn't long before the parents realize Miles is messed up and he is looking at ink blots.The film is pretty much what you expected. The ending could have gone a number of ways. They opted for the sequel version.Guide: F-word. Brief male nudity.",The Prodigy
2,paul_haakonsen,Nothing out of the ordinary here...,4,13 May 2020,"When I was given the chance to sit down and watch this 2019 movie titled ""The Prodigy"" from writer Jeff Buhler and director Nicholas McCarthy, of course I took the chance. I mean, the movie does have a rather interesting cover and a horror movie that has some scary child in it usually tends to be worthwhile watching.Usually...""The Prodigy"" was not particularly interesting, nor was it scary. If it was anything, it was predictable. Which was a shame, because that factor definitely took away a lot of enjoyment from the movie in my opinion.I wanted to like ""The Prodigy"", I really did. But it was hard to like it because the storyline was just less than mediocre, and it wasn't a particular scary or disturbing movie in any way.It should be said that they had some nicely casted actors and actresses to perform in the movie, and it was nice to see Colm Feore make an appearance in the movie.""The Prodigy"" just failed to cut it, and it wasn't a movie that really was particularly outstanding in the horror genre. Especially since it was so frightfully devoid of anything overly scary.I will say that the concept of the movie was good, and there definitely was a lot of potential there - untapped and squandered potential, I might add.My rating of ""The Prodigy"" settles on a less than mediocre four out of ten stars. I've seen the movie and can tick it off the watch list, but this is hardly a movie that I will be returning to watch a second time, as it just didn't have the contents to support multiple viewing - hardly had enough for the first time, to be honest.",The Prodigy
3,view_and_review,Average at Best,6,10 February 2019,"The Prodigy is a horror movie about a young boy that shows signs of advanced intelligence but also signs of more sinister issues. From early on it is clear that everything is not quite right with Miles Blume (Jackson Robert Scott). The key is to 1.) find out what's wrong and 2.) find out how to fix it. They find out what was wrong but the solution was the biggest head scratcher in my humble opinion. Not that the solution defied logic, it's just that it didn't seem to be the best course of action-but hey, worse solutions have yielded positive results.The movie was chilling. That usually is the case with a scary movie with the central figure being a kid. There were a couple of jump scares but only one that was a quality jump scare. Most jump scares are somewhat telegraphed in their set up, the best ones are those that aren't set up at all, just BAM! Out of nowhere.Up until the end I thought this could be an above average movie. By the end it was average at best.",The Prodigy
4,neil-476,Indifferent,5,25 March 2019,"The film opens with us seeing Sarah give birth to baby Miles at the same time as a torturing murder is killed by police. As Miles grows, he is very advanced for his age, but he begins to show some worrying tendencies. Advisors come to the conclusion that he may well have had a serial killer reincarnated within him.This is not so much a horror film as a psychological thriller with mild supernatural overtones and some blood. It is completely predictable from start to finish, has a couple of made-you-jump orchestra hits, and a decent performance by Jackson Robert Scott as Miles.Having told you that, you really don't need to go and see it, because it will hold no surprises for you, it's that obvious. The only question would have been whether Miles is actually host to a serial killer or not, and the film more or less answered that in the first couple of minutes.",The Prodigy
5,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Exceptionally predictable and underwhelming effort,4,10 June 2019,"Following the birth of their son, a couple is overjoyed when they find out he's supposedly a genius child, but once they are witness to strange events and interactions with other kids they slowly come to believe his stories are due to the reincarnated spirit inhabiting him and try to stop it.For the most part, this one was exceptionally routine and predictable. What really tends to work nicely here is the expected scenes of the kid snapping and committing all the strange incidents. The early scenes of the couple discovering the true nature of his condition start up the first half rather nicely, effectively giving this the perfect lead-in to the overall discovery of the kid. The verbal threats he utters against the mother, speaking in unusual tongues, the interviews done with the social workers and the interaction he has with the other kids all start rolling this along and prepares this one for the big finale where the action and intensity picks up considerably due to the evil child getting into more creepiness with his actions. There's some fun to be had with that aspect of the film. That said, there are still many flaws here. The biggest issue to be had is the fact that there's not much in the way of detailing anything original in the setup featured here. The formula of the gifted child who's just a bit too different to be normal but nobody else is capable of seeing that due to the innocence of the child doing it that has everyone fooled just seems to be so rudimentary and expected that it's really not shocking once he snaps and goes crazy. With a vast majority of these scenes coming about due to the wholly expected trope as the carelessness of the parents to ignore everything that's going on around them and deny everything that he's doing simply because he's their son, this formula is exceptionally apparent throughout here with very little exceptions. The other problem here is the rather bland and non-horror first hour that really has so little to actually evoke scares or suspense. Since this is all based around the growing concerns of his behavior and the realization of his current state before focusing on the road to get revenge, the setup here doesn't really generate any kind of scares or shocking moments at all beyond the concept of what the kid is doing. There are vague threats and some imposing actions towards others, none of the scares here really generate any kind of shocks or suspense leading up to the eventual revelation. This ends up offering a rather bland experience with no jump-scares and far too much reliance on the potential for something to happen yet never ends up going there as it forces plenty of expected behaviors from it. These here are what end up doing the most damage against this one.Rated R: Graphic Language, Graphic Violence, violence-against-animals and children-in-jeopardy.",The Prodigy
6,phd_travel,Scary in parts but irritating,6,31 January 2020,The premise is quite good. A child is inhabited via reincarnation by a serial killer. But the execution has unnecessary shock tactics. They need to look to Damien Omen movies on how to build up tension.The irritating ending brings down the movie. Even if she loved her kid how could she go to the innocent woman's house? Lost sympathy for the characters then.Taylor Schilling looks quite scared. The poor kid actors having to act such gory things. Does it do any damage to them.The title is not right. He's not a prodigy. Not great but some scary parts.,The Prodigy
7,deloudelouvain,Not original but not bad.,7,26 April 2019,"In the horror/thriller genre The Prodigy isn't a bad movie. It's not totally new, this story has been done before, but nonetheless it is entertaining. Maybe the mystery is revealed a bit too soon, they could have dragged it a bit more, I would have elaborated the story of the serial killer more, but even then it still has a dark ambiance and there is the mandatory suspense. It's nice to see Taylor Schilling in something else than Orange Is The New Black, I thought she did a good job. As well as the young Jackson Robert Scott (remember little Georgie Denbrough from Stephen Kings ""It""), he was freaky when he needed to be. All in all The Prodigy gave me the entertainment that I was expecting so I'm not disappointed like some others aparently are.",The Prodigy
8,FeastMode,my notes,7,27 July 2019,"Well made horror flick. very creepy with an intriguing story and some really scary moments (1 viewing)
SPOILERS
the old faced child moment really creeped me out. and the jump scare where the son run towards the mom and ends up being the adult, it made me jump so much that i scared filfil who was sitting in my lap, he jumped off me so quick and owned my leg. it was pretty hilarious and a beastly jump scare",The Prodigy
9,Edvis-1997,9,9,18 May 2019,Brilliant movie. Very intense wasn't very scary but had a lot of action going on. Liked the main idea about someone inside the boy and the plot was continuous it won't surprise it or you won't find scary jump in this film but it's very nice movie for 2019.,The Prodigy
10,851222,What a pleasant surprise at the movies,9,10 May 2019,"Greetings from Lithuania.So i just came back from a premier of ""The Prodigy"" (2019). I haven't seen any trailers of it, haven't read synopsis, no critics or IMDb before seeing it - only a poster from which i knew this is going to be a horror thriller with actress i really liked from that women prison drama / comedy - that is it. And i can tell you,without any spoilers - ""The Prodigy"" isn't a straightforward horror movie, but a thriller with some scare jump moments. And what an effective little bloody good thriller this is! It was superbly directed, superbly acted by Taylor Schilling and even more by a little Jackson Robert Scott who stole every scene in my opinion - his acting was one of the few reason that ""The Prodigy"" actually was one of the very best thrillers i saw in a movie theaters in some time now - he was simply brilliant.Overall, i really enjoyed seeing ""The Prodigy"" without any expectations. It has very good (kinda original) story, good script, very good acting and directing. This is one of the best thrillers in a recent memory.",The Prodigy
11,jacobjohntaylor1,This movie is awful,1,27 June 2019,This is one of the worst movies ever made. This has an awful story. It has an awful ending. It is not scary at all. You know when say something is a 5.9 you are saying it is a good movie. 5.9 is overrating this movie. I give this 1 out of 10. This is awful. Do not see this awful movie.,The Prodigy
12,ops-52535,its not that bad!?,7,24 April 2019,"Prodigy is an horror drama with lots of correlations to the horror blockbusters ''the omen'' we are following the growth of a boy with sinister aliens within, it a kind of sole jumping,as when a man dies his sole take mansion in a newborn body, kind of reincarnation.its a movie with lots of suspence and the childacting are very good. the story and plot has its loopholes that makes some of the real horror seem daft. the score are well embroidered into the film, and the lightsetting are cfredible and makes some boost to the flick.its well worth a look if you believe in superstition and reincarnation. so mthe grumpy old man thiks that to kill the beast is best, but its still alive for a sequel to come so join the consept.its recommendable watching",The Prodigy
13,paulclaassen,Different take on over-used genre.,5,29 October 2019,"'The Prodigy' is an interesting take on the possession genre. This is the story of evil being reborn in an infant, and the evil trying to take control of its host as the child grows older. Evil manifests itself through the child, and this in itself can be rather creepy.The beginning was pretty formulaic, but as the film progressed, it became more compelling, with a few twists. The film is also very unpredictable. Taylor Schilling was excellent as the mother, while Jackson Robert Scott was good as Miles, the 'possessed' child. He has an incredible cold, creepy stare.Note, the film might not have the ending you'd expect, but this is a rather well executed film.",The Prodigy
14,cruise01,Creepy concept but poorly done film.,6,9 May 2019,"The Prodigy (3 out of 5 stars).The Prodigy is a decent horror film which gives a creepy tone over any scares or suspense. It does play around with a creepy concept idea of reincarnation or possessing ones body. The direction by Nicholas McCarthy does not really hold up the film with a proper storytelling, developed characters, and it lacks in delivering any suspense or scares.The plot follows Sarah (Taylor Schilling) and John (Peter Mooney) having their first son Miles (Jackson Robert Scott). Except their son is unique. His cognitive skills are advanced; he is a sweet kid who learns faster than others. When the son begins having nightmares and starts rambling about a foreign saying. His behavior becomes more aggressive towards others.The plot was decent. The script and direction was all over the place. The beginning of the movie opened with a lady escaping from her capture. Then, a moment later a SWAT team tries to arrest a strange psychotic guy. Which then leads to this happy couple that are excited to start a family. The editing of the film does make every dramatic moment felt brief. Miles attacks another student in school. A second later, he is being evaluated by a psychologist. The film moves at a brisk pace with no character development or giving enough time for the story to develop.The film does lack in scares as well. The creepiest feeling ever is when Sarah is waiting in the hallway as Miles runs up to her for a hug which surprises her with some creepy old man. Otherwise, the film is kind of boring and lacking in thrills and suspense too.Overall, The Prodigy is a fair film. The concept idea is creepy. The direction, script, and story development really falls apart with a lazy direction.",The Prodigy
15,TheMovieDiorama,The Prodigy loses its intelligent setup by succumbing to generic jump scares.,4,19 March 2019,"Think 'Orphan' with a dash of every other generic possession film you can think of. Just another ""evil child"" flick with minimal thrills, scares and one heck of a predictable story. A newborn child rapidly develops his brain quicker than most, to which he soon starts acting strangely and violently when he turns eight.McCarthy is not the most well-known horror director, however he certainty does have an eye for atmospheric shots and suitably dim lighting. A young Robert Scott played the prodigy son brilliantly, by simply changing facial expression he was able to convey a murderous twinge to his character. Oh, and a few sentences about phallic organs that made me laugh out loud (although somewhat conniving...). There were one or two ominous moments, particularly when the son runs towards the camera in the dark, and I did jump out of my chair twice. Not because it was scary.No, unfortunately this film graces us with the loudest, most obnoxious jump scares possible. Boy turns to mirror? Loud piercing noise! Light doesn't turn on? Block your ears! Boy says ""I love you""? Well, you get the idea. As a horror, it's not scary. The themes of reincarnation and rebirthing have been executed before countless times, consequently making this experience a rather dull affair. Schilling and Feore's parental performances were mediocre at best and the film concludes unsatisfactorily in an attempt to open up for a sequel. A few plot decisions, such as the mother's choice to visit a victim's house, was just diabolically stupid and selfish. I mean really? These characters just didn't think like rational human beings, and that's what made the film worse. They all conformed to typical horror tropes, making this a highly unmemorable flick. Best to use your brain cells somewhere else.",The Prodigy

17,jtindahouse,A horror film that feels a class above the usual,8,3 June 2019,"How I love an R-rated horror movie. The reason? It completely opens up the limitations on what can happen. PG-13 horror movies are predictable almost down to the detail. 'The Prodigy' managed to catch me off guard multiple times. The strange thing about this movie though, is that even though it's clearly a horror, at times it doesn't feel like a horror. Even though there is a supernatural element, it often just feels like an extremely dark thriller. This isn't a 'Children of the Corn' type movie where every character must be dispensed of one by one. There is more going on than that, and I liked it.There is actually a lot of patience in this movie. Almost the entire first hour is spent explaining and setting up what it actually going on. Not in a tedious or boring way though. It never feels dull or dragged out. You just sort of think at about the 60 minute mark, I'm really enjoying this, but come to think of it not a lot has actually happened. Then in the final third things kick into gear and the film took me to some places I didn't expect to be taken. I really liked the handling of the end of this film.'The Prodigy' is well made, well acted, fun horror film that I thoroughly enjoyed. I could see sequel potential in this too. Perhaps with entirely new characters using the same ""prodigy"" concept. I'm not sure how this did at the box-office as to whether that will actually happen or not. But if they do, I'll be there to watch it.",The Prodigy
18,dfranzen70,Bland as a sugar-free bag of sugar,5,9 May 2019,"Just too much sameness. Supersmart kid appears to be possessed; mother wants to find out what's up. The movie has so many elements you've seen before. Random acts of violence by a tiny tyke. Fear of the supernatural, stoked by professionals who should know better. Two parents, one believing it's something beyond science and one stubbornly refusing to believe such. The movie takes so long between scary scenes that one starts to anticipate there being a big switcheroo, some kind of twist that'll salvage the boilerplate plot. But alas and alack, it's just another good kid inhabited by bad dude movie. Like if Chucky were a real boy.",The Prodigy
19,stevendbeard,Alright As A Rental,7,25 February 2019,"I saw ""The Prodigy"", starring Jackson Robert Scott-It_2017, Fear the Walking Dead_tv; Taylor Schilling-Orange is the New Black_tv, Argo; Peter Mooney-Rookie Blue_tv, The Artists and Colm Feore-Thor, The Chronicles of Riddick.
This is a horror movie with an 8 year old boy as the protagonist. It starts with a young woman escaping from a serial killer in the woods. Then, it switches over to a different city where Peter & Taylor are expecting their first baby. It goes back and forth between the two scenes until the serial killer is cornered and killed by the police. Well guess what? That is exactly when Taylor & Peter have their little baby boy-Hmmmm, I wonder if there might be some kind of a connection here? Anyway, the boy starts acting a little strange. He is highly intelligent. He doesn't get along with any other kids. He gets into fights. Walks around carrying sharp objects, well, you get the drift. Jackson plays the 8 year old boy. Oh yeah, both the serial killer and Jackson share something else; Heterochromia, which is having two different colored eyes, in this case, one brown & one blue. Taylor & Peter finally hear about a doctor that specializes in situations like theirs and they head off to get help. Colm plays the doc. You do find out why the killer came back in the first place.
It's rated ""R"" for violence, disturbing & bloody images and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 32 minutes.
I don't know if I would buy it on DVD but it would be alright, as a rental.",The Prodigy

Hopefully THE PRODIGY's revelations have been highlighted during many of Leader Trump's recent Daily Briefings, so that the insidious migration of foreign butchers into our U.S. Homeland can be banned, stopped, and curtailed AT LEAST until the Year 2100 (if not permanently!). Even a quick end to the importation of nefarious slayers such as ""Ed Scarka"" still leaves the USA with countless ""ticking time bombs"" roaming our streets and neighborhoods, who were NEVER thoroughly vetted! THE PRODIGY discloses that there's a 50-50 chance that outsiders previously allowed to cross our borders actually are reincarnated demons! These ghouls would as soon chop your hand off as to give you a light. Leader Trump MUST vastly expand America's existing network of high security detention camps in order to house ANYONE who's entered the USA since 1950, as well as ALL of their descendants, until a panel of REAL Americans can vouch that they're not reincarnated mass murderers. Even the most innocent-looking toddlers of foreign origin will gut you like a fish, when they're under the influence of Foreign Reincarnation Powers, THE PRODIGY reveals.

22,dar0417,Good Kid,6,23 January 2020,Horror film with a different ending that you wouldn't expect.,The Prodigy
23,jimbo-53-186511,"Creepy, disturbing and brilliant",8,18 January 2020,"Sarah and John Blume (Taylor Schilling and Peter Mooney) have recently welcomed the arrival of their baby son Miles (Jackson Robert Scott). From an early age, Miles shows signs of being exceptionally bright and is way ahead of other children of a similar age. However, as Miles gets older his behaviour begins to become increasingly odd and erratic. Sarah and John both become concerned about Miles and when they refer the matter to specialists they aren't quite prepared for the explanation surrounding their son's behaviour...Whilst the idea of an entity possessing another person isn't particularly fresh I don't think I've ever seen a film where a dead person's soul has been re-incarnated in the body of another person. In this respect, The Prodigy has a slightly different take on 'possession' and I have to say that it is very well-executed here...Chronicling Miles' life from birth, The Prodigy is a slow-burner, but it's one of those films that gradually reveals something new about Miles up until he reaches the age of 8 and I was left constantly wondering what was going to happen next.. Therefore it is a film I'd class as slow-burning as opposed to simply slow (there's always something happening of interest rather than the narrative being unnecessarily padded out).The story is actually pretty good (intriguing and involving) when watching I found myself wanting to know who had possessed Miles and why? Then you have his poor parents who are trying to raise and love their son, whilst also trying to deal with the dangerous personality vying for control of his mind and body. For me, this is a big reason for the film being successful - it's actually really creepy seeing a child acting and conveying behaviour more akin to an adult. Take the scene where the doctor is trying to rid Miles of the entity and the sickening speech that the entity gives to prevent him from cleansing Miles. It's at this point you realise that the entity is both clever and dangerous and that poor Miles may be at the point of no return.Technical aspects of the film are also excellent; the score is magnificent. The direction is superb; McCarthy manages to bring creepiness to a whole new level here - part of this is achieved through shadows and incidental music, but a lot of the success is down to young Jackson Robert Scott who has taken on something of a dual role that would probably be a challenge to a lot of adults. He's a talented young actor who gives a creepy and unnerving performance and I hope to see him in more films.The Prodigy isn't for the faint-hearted as there are quite a few shocking and brutal scenes (animal lovers in particular are advised to approach with extreme caution). The only other thing I'll add is that I hope Jackson Scott was well looked after on set as this is a very dark role for a young boy to take on - I really hope that 'clever editing' was involved with some of his scenes as I reckon the poor kid would need therapy for life judging by some of the things he sees/does and says.All in all The Prodigy is a brilliant film, but I can't guarantee it will be to all tastes.",The Prodigy
24,sauravjoshi85,The plot should've handled better.,5,24 October 2020,"The Prodigy is a horror movie directed by Nicholas McCarthy and stars Jackson Robert Scott, Taylor Schilling, Colm Feore, Peter Mooney and Brittany Allen in the leads.The plot of the movie is undoubtedly unique and had lots of scope for improvisation and hence getting a good horror movie but the immature approach by the director had ruined a good plot.The acting is superb and Jackson was surprisingly superb in his character of a disturbed son. Rest of the cast were equally impressive. Screenplay lacks the typical gripping nature of the the horror movies and is good in parts. Direction is average but cinematography is beautiful.As mentioned earlier that the plot has lot's of scope to execute but fails, the climax of the movie is unfinished and it seems that the makers were planning for a sequel of the movie.Overall a decent horror movie which should've been handled well.

25,drownnnsoda,"Downbeat, contemporary take on the ""bad seed"" movie; manages to engage with genre tropes without coming off as trite",7,18 February 2019,"""The Prodigy"" has Taylor Schilling playing a young mother who, along with her husband, begins noticing behavioral shifts in their eight-year-old savant son, Miles, that may be more than a mere child psychologist can handle.I went into this film was half-hearted expectations, as the ""bad seed"" setup has been done to death, and based on the premise of the film, I was hyperaware that things could go sideways here; fortunately, they don't. ""The Prodigy"" does not reinvent the wheel, but it knows how to spin it with ample proficiency. The plot is standard in this genre, taking cues from ""The Exorcist"" and ""The Bad Seed,"" and handing out stylistic nods to ""The Omen,"" but it's not exactly any one of those films; it's not a standard possession or Satanic-kid film, nor is it a clear-cut killer kid movie.The film is well-shot and atmospheric, and there are some unexpected scares here, save the one that appeared in the trailer (which is an unabashed Mario Bava ripoff from ""Shock""). There were a couple instances of jump scares that actually got me hook, line, and sinker, and it was after those moments that I realized the film was doing something successfully. The performances are strong, and Schilling makes for a solid lead here, playing a character torn at the seams between saving her son and saving those around her (and herself). One of the singular flaws I found was that the filmmakers (or possibly the studio's talking heads) at times undermine the audience's intellect; there are a handful of moments where excessive explanatory dialogue is inserted which feels far too ""beat them over the head with it,"" but it's a fairly forgivable distraction.The last act is surprisingly nerve-wracking and dark, and the film unwinds in a place that I never expected it to. By the end of it, I was pleasantly surprised by it as a whole. It is inarguably derivative, but it works within its own wheelhouse quite nicely, exuding flair and a handful of truly effective moments. I went into the theater bracing myself for a potential ""killer kid"" hackjob flick, but was rewarded with something at least mildly thoughtful, and perhaps more importantly, just plain fun. ""The Prodigy"" manages to, for the most part, engage with genre tropes in a way that doesn't come across as unbearably trite or dated, so for that I have to give credit. 7/10.",The Prodigy

27,Pairic,Good Paranormal Thriller,8,19 March 2019,"The Prodigy: A film with a Folk Horror opening: a fist crashes through a wooden door, unbolting it from the outside. A woman runs through woods, crosses a stream, is almost run over by an elderly woman who has long dreads adding to the (Folk vibe). The fleeing woman, Margaret (Brittany Allen) shows her arm stump: ""he took my hand!"". Cut to a couple heading to hospital, the woman is about to give birth. Back to the house the woman escaped from. A serial killer, Scarka (Paul Fauteux) within is surrounded by a SWAT Team. He commits suicide by cop. Cut to a baby being born as the killer dies. This all happens in the first ten minutes of the film and perhaps it gives too much information, making clear the connection between the killer and the baby boy.The boy, Miles, is indeed a prodigy showing great promise at 20 weeks, 2 years, 5 years. At age 8 Miles (Jackson Scott) is still way ahead of his peers but shows some worrying behaviour. At first this is more obvious to his mother Sarah (Taylor Schilling) than to his father John (Peter Monney). This could have been just another murderous kid movie as Miles hits a classmate with a wrench and harms animals but it returns to it's Folk Horror roots with the arrival of Arthur (Colm Feore) a psychologist who specialises in rebirth and reincarnation. This is no case of possession as no demonic entity is involved, rather a deceased personality, a Dybbuk which is Scarka, is trying to take over Miles. The internal struggle is illustrated as Miles wears a skeleton suit at Halloween but his face is only half covered by skull make-up.There are a few scares and scenes of savage violence but most of the narrative unfolds in a low key fashion, maintaining tension but after the frantic opening sequence it does result in uneven pacing.

you can't have his bodyMurderous children or those possessed by dark forces appear in horror movies on a regularly base. Sometimes it's a diabolical power that possesses them. Damien from ""The Omen"" and Regan in ""The Exorcist"" are good examples. Or it's the mental condition that turns lovely little boys into horrible little monsters like Luke in ""Better watch out"" and Chavs in ""Eden Lake"". In ""The Prodigy"" Miles develops a deviant behavior pattern as he gets older. This cuddly little boy appears to have a dual personality. One moment he snuggles into his mother's arms. The next moment he looks at her demonically. Such an evil look that gives you goosebumps instantly. Verily, there's something wrong with these Miles (Jackson Robert Scott).To be honest I was pleasantly surprised by ""The Prodigy"". Admittedly, it's not very original and the film makes good use of all known tricks from the horror genre. Yet this film managed to make me feel uncomfortable. And I even felt a slight form of tension. And that was mainly achieved by the acting of the young Jackson Robert Scott. A little guy who's years ahead of other kids in terms of intelligence. But when his use of language during his sleep (in a Hungarian dialect) takes on a fairly mature tone and he tackles fellow students with a heavy wrench, a sense of suspicion begins to increase on his mother Sarah (Taylor Schilling). The result is an adult psychological game that unfolds between mother and son.Jef Buhler (scriptwriter of, among others, ""Pet Sematary"", ""Jacob's Ladder"" and next year's film ""The Grudge"") takes his time here and slowly builds up the tension. Hence the slow pace at the start of the film. Which for once I didn't experience as disturbing. It's only when spiritualist Arthur Jacobson (Colm Feore) is introduced that the pace goes up. Here it also becomes clear what the opening scene has to do with this sweet-looking youngster who's troubled by behavioral problems. Fragments of a psychopath shot down by a special unit and the birth of Miles are being linked to each other. And then the term reincarnation comes up. An explanation that suddenly makes everything clearer. Unfortunately, the motivation why this all happens is easy to guess.""The Prodigy"" is an easily digestible and entertaining horror, despite the predictability and a not so ingeniously put together story. The acting work of Jackson Robert Scott and Taylor Schilling makes up for a lot. Expect some excitement, some jump scares and for some perhaps a surprising denouement. In recent years, a few films have been released with bombastic statements claiming to be the ""Scariest horror in years"" or ""More frightening than The Exorcist"". ""The Prodigy"" surpasses them all. Without magniloquent slogans. Ergo, highly recommended.More reviews here: movie-freak.be",The Prodigy
30,Reviews_of_the_Dead,"Interesting, Darker Update of a Classic Concept",6,16 May 2019,"This was a film that I wanted to see when I first heard about it. I'm intrigued when it comes to films about weird children and this definitely gave off a The Omen vibe from the trailer. It took me until it hit DVD to finally see it and I wrote up this review. The synopsis is a mother concerned about her young son's disturbing behavior thinks something supernatural may be affecting him.The film begins showing us an old house in Montgomery County, Ohio. We see a woman escape from the door. We learn later her name is Margaret St. James (Brittany Allen). She flees into the wilderness and stops a car. It is then we realize, she is missing a hand. Juxtaposed with this is Sarah Blume (Taylor Schilling) going into labor in Pennsylvania. Her husband is freaked out, John (Peter Mooney). They go to the hospital. We go back to Ohio where the police raid the house that belongs to Edward Scarka (Paul Fauteux). He is killed and we learn later on he is a serial killer. The final image here is that his gunshot wounds matches the blood on Miles, Sarah and John's new son.We then get to meet the boy at age 2, 5 and finally 8. It is during these different times in his life we learn some things about him. The first is that he has a hazel and a blue eye. He is extremely smart, to the point where Sarah takes him to doctors to measure his IQ and they soon learn, he has issues connecting with his peers. We do see that he has some quirks as well. The first is that he crushes a spider and seems to enjoy it.Miles ends up being played by Jackson Robert Scott. We get an interesting scene where dinner is given to him and he asks to use paprika. When pushed on this, he doesn't know how he knows what it is, but he knows he likes it. They assume it is just his advancement. That night though he has a violent run-in with his babysitter during a game of Hide and Seek. There's another at school that is even worse that sparks Sarah to take Miles to Dr. Elaine Strasser (Paula Boudreau). Sarah also records Miles while he is talking in his sleep and gives the tape to Dr. Strasser. She brings in Arthur Jacobson (Colm Feore) who reveals the language Miles is speaking is a peculiar dialect from Hungary that is spoken close to the Romanian border.When the family dog goes missing, John becomes upset with Miles and there is a history that is revealed with him. What is going on with this boy? Can he be saved before he is too late?Now I will admit, I did go a bit vague here, because I don't want to spoil what is revealed as what is happening to Miles. It does come fairly early in the movie and I think it does a solid job at establishing this with things shown early on. My issue here though, I don't actually think this is what people who believe in this concept really think it works this way. Many, including myself, don't believe it in at all, but since it can't be proven, I guess it could be.Something I did really like about the film is how evil they show Miles can be. There is something that is quite frightening when you have a child that has no remorse for his actions and does some pretty heinous things, which are given here. I will warn you, there is a dog in the film and it really turns me to hating the child with what happens to it.A big issue I had with how this film plays out, I don't believe Sarah would decide to do what she did. I understand that she wants to save him, but she isn't completely sure her plan would work and I think it really is out of character for her to make the decision she does. I really think this actually hurts the film for me, because I don't believe it.This brings me to another issue I had, which was the pacing of the film. I just found it to be boring. The introduction seems really rushed and we move through a lot of things really quickly. It doesn't give a lot of time to process what they are showing to you. The film then slowed down a bit too much and it was actually jarring. I do like the implications at the end of the film, but it also seems like they were trying too hard to make it feel bleak at the end in my opinion. You are talking to someone who loves bleak endings and even I was put off a bit by it.It is a shame though, because there is some good acting here. I thought Scott did well at conveying being a sympathetic child to being a completely monster. The change could actually happen on a dime, which really impressed me about a kid this young. I'm definitely impressed. I thought Schilling was solid as the mother. The only issues I have with are her motivation. Mooney was fine, but we don't get a lot of him. I found this to be a bit odd, especially with how they try to present the character. I just didn't feel that it was possible. I think him being violent needed to be introduced before it is hinted at. Feore is a guy I don't see a lot of, but he is solid in everything I have, including this. Fauteux was pretty good as well in his limited role. The rest of the cast did round this out for what was needed as well.To the effects of the film, there weren't a lot of them to be honest. The blood and the attack scenes we do get are done practical. They also look good. There was some CGI, but they hid it. I'm actually a big fan of this as it doesn't give us a chance to critique it too much. I will say, it was freaky seeing Miles look like Scarka, but you aren't completely sure that's what you are seeing. The film is shot very well also.The final thing to cover is the soundtrack of the film. For the most part, it really didn't stand out to me, but it didn't hurt the film really either. I will say that I liked the use of the song that Miles is humming. It does come off as somewhat creepy and even more when Sarah pushes him on it. She is starting to believe what Arthur told her and this is more evidence. I did think that was well played.Now with that said, this film was actually pretty disappointed. I thought there were some good ideas here and concepts, but it falls a bit flat. This is an underutilized concept for sure. I think a lot of it is hurt by the pacing and how some things a presented. Motivations of characters are something else I had issue with. The acting was pretty solid though and I thought the effects that were used, both practical and CGI, were good. The soundtrack didn't stand out overall, but I liked the use of Miles humming. Overall I do just find this film to be slightly above average. I would still say give it a viewing if this sounds interesting as it isn't horrible, but just disappointing.",The Prodigy
31,robertemerald,Full on creepy horror,9,29 December 2019,"The Prodigy is a very creepy movie. It's the sort of movie where there are moments you just don't want to watch. If you want to make a double of this genre try We Need To Talk About Kevin (2011), or maybe The Good Son (1993), or better yet another super creepy film, Brightburn (2019). Brightburn is similar in that at a certain point parents must face up to the danger posed by the son, and, like The Prodigy, there are chilling escalations of word and then deed. Another recent horror involving children was the superb Boarding School (2018). I had to dock a point for the soundtrack to The Prodigy. It was certainly very creepy and ominous, but it also had a sort of funeral procession thing going as well. That's a minor point and shouldn't distract from the excellence of this evil little gem. The prodigy is an accomplished piece of horror work in every way, and is certainly original. I think the closest to the idea used here is Fallen (1998), but that didn't involve children in any way, and was about a demon. The prodigy is the first horror movie I've watched this year that genuinely had hairs standing up at the back of my neck. Wonderful horror movie.",The Prodigy

(R)When Schilling's young son (Scott) exhibits more and more disturbing behavior, the mother looks for answers to what's causing it; is the kid just a bad seed in need of intensive counseling or is there some sort of supernatural force at work? Better-than-expected but curiously-titled horror film (the fact that the kid shows an aptitude for learning and cognitive development barely factors into the premise and is all but ignored after that); it strains credibility and often defies its own twisted logic--especially upon reflection after the credits roll--but still provides a few effective chills and jump scares, along with a legitimately creepy, monstrous moppet. Slick direction, pacing, and accumulation of tension are above average for its somewhat disreputable sub-genre; goes further into ""shocking"" territory than most most killer-kid flicks, but not far enough to be truly memorable.62/100",The Prodigy

I watch something and I simply tell you whether I liked it or not despite what others may think of my opinion. This film was an absolutely decent watch. I enjoyed it and even with the amount of predictability, I was still interested in where the film was leading and the route it was taking.For me, the kid in this film did an awesome job. Creepy kid movies can be disturbing and there was at least one really disturbing moment that I'm not likely to forget anytime soon. I'm a mom though and had this moment happen between my son and I, I would have laid a golden egg in our hallway. The kid did a great job.The actress playing the mother was ok but, once again, I'm a mother. There were times when I felt that she was being a bit too clueless to keep things grounded. The Dad was simply a flaky character.I liked the story. It could have benefited from a bit more backstory. There were a few things that seemed to be glazed over when they could have added to the depth of who the characters were and the understanding as to why they made the choices they chose to make.I was pleased with it. It gets 6.5 stars from me. Of course, I had to round it up to 7 stars. Not a bad watch for a night on the couch.",The Prodigy

40,IonicBreezeMachine,Slightly above average killer child movie.,6,16 November 2020,"Sarah and John Blume (Taylor Schilling and Peter Mooney) discover their gifted child Miles (Jackson Robert Scott ) may be evil.The Prodigy is fairly standard as far as evil child horror films go. And given how resilient the subgenre has shown itself to be, it's understandable why they're still being made. The movie doesn't reach the heights of the best evil kid movies, but it's also nowhere near the worst.The performances by Schilling, Mooney, and Scott are all very strong and carry the movie quite well. Jackson Robert Scott is best known for playing Georgie in the It movies and it's nice to see that he's just as good in this movie as he was in that one. Scott is appropriately scary when the situation calls for it and can effortlessly switch between cold hearted sadist and cowering little boy on a hair trigger.The only real drawback to the movie is in its familiarity. The movie has all the typical tropes you associate with a movie like this such as the family pet who exists solely for the purpose of being killed, the standard denial scenes where the parents don't address the situation like they should, among others.The Prodigy is well made and well acted, but it doesn't do much to distinguish itself from the glut of evil kid horror movies.",The Prodigy

A scene when the Miles hugging his mother he glimpse his real body is very scary. As me this movie should have sequel and must have prequel.

There are some moments offered that invite the mental and emotional chills to come out and they do. It is more of a story-driven scare which means the audience has to participate to make it go full circle. It does so because the Director sets it up to engage and what follows is we are now one of the lead players trying to make decisions as to what we should or should not do next and some of those decisions are not easy. The acting manages to convince and the outcome allows this movie to join the greats for this genre. Furthermore, there is an attractive hint of an offering of sequels and if done right who wouldn't want to know what the ""evil"" in this movie does next and how it does it!

47,rockman182,The Prodigy (2019),6,10 February 2019,"Always down for a horror film no matter what. The trailer for The Prodigy was intriguing though its one of those cases where it should have shown less, less is more for this one. That jump scare that ends the trailer would have been fantastic if we didn't know it was coming in the theater. Anyways, this film has things going for it in the beginning and starts off intriguing before degenerating into a mess.The film is about an eight year old boy named Miles. Initially, his parents believe him to be gifted but they soon realize that something is off about their son. His actions become bizarre and border on psychopathy. It turns out Miles is possessed with the reincarnated spirit of a deranged serial killer who died at the same moment that Miles was born. His parents must figure out what to do to set their son free from the evil that has embodied him.There's an intriguing premise here. The kid actor on display as Miles is good, and Taylor Schilling is as well. The film doesn't offer so many jump scares as I thought it would from the trailer and is driven in its plot. The mood and tone set up at first really works. I'd say the last quarter of the film is where it goes to hell. When the endgame and the progression towards it is revealed, I really lost interest.The character motivations and actions are also extremely idiotic. To the point where I wanted to curse at the screen in the cinema. The film needed to arrive at its conclusion in a way that kind of respected the build up and quality of the beginning. Still for horror seekers who aren't too critical, this could be something to enjoy.5.5/10",The Prodigy

50,kjproulx,Wasted Potential,5,10 February 2019,"I've never been a huge fan of the horror genre, aside from a few gems that stand out to me. It takes a lot for a horror film to impress me, as the genre has become somewhat of the butt of many jokes these days. The Prodigy wasn't ever going to be the best horror film to come along in decades or anything like that, so I had no expectations when going into this one. With that said, this is the definition of a film that has a lot of promising elements, but ultimately fails to capitalize on them. I can't get myself to recommend this movie, but I also don't feel the need to rip it apart either. The Prodigy is a middle of the road experience at best, but there is some good in it.After failing to conceive a child for many years, a couple gains the happiness they've been seeking when it finally becomes possible. After just months of being born, Miles shows signs of being a genius, hence the title, The Prodigy. When mysterious things begin to occur due to his behaviour, religious beliefs and myths come to light and this film becomes incredibly intriguing. Without ruining what powers are really at work here, I'll just say the twist of this story had me hooked. It's a little silly an overly convoluted, but it worked in the context of the film.Sadly, that's where most of my praise ends. With a solid cast including Taylor Schilling, Colm Feore, and young Jackson Robert Scott, they're able to sell this material and make it very believable. The third act, however, is one of the dumbest conclusions to a film I've seen a while. To even get into it would be a spoiler, but it felt like the climax to a completely different film and it felt mean-spirited to me. It's like a unique idea was building to something cool, but ultimately takes a super easy route out of the story and the fact that it's a child playing this certain role was slightly disturbing (in a bad way).In the end, The Prodigy is a horror film that benefits from a few great jump-scares that had me jumping out of my seat and some very devoted performances, but the movie truly does unravel by the time the credits roll. This is the worst kind of film to watch because it's not terrible by any means, but it doesn't fully embrace its premise. This movie was like watching a superhero film where the hero of the story tells you everything they can do, but never showcases much of that power. The Prodigy may please some viewers, but I found it to be a waste of potential and mean-spirited from start to finish.

He seemed to be evil all the time. When he told her when ( like the specialist said he was a rare case and never slept and lied all the time).

62,Just-A-Girl-14,Really creepy!,7,30 October 2019,"I've seen tons of horror movies so the concept of possession or reincarnation is familiar to me. I would describe this case as more of a possession case rather than reincarnation but when you talk about possession you usually think of a demon or some sort of supernatural entity. In this case, it's a human who possessed Miles, a monster human but still human so that's why I think they chose to call it reincarnation. Either way, I found the doctor's explanation to be pretty good.As for the film itself, there's nothing unique about it but at the same time it really creeped me out!!
I think it's not just the story, it's the acting. The kid is doing a really good job and so are the parents.
Everything about it was really scary even the parts that were totally predictable!I wish there was a better ending for the family. I know it's not the way horror movies usually go but I was really rooting for the mother. I was really hoping she can get that monster out of her son's body and get the happy ending she was hoping for.On the other hand, the ending does leave a lot of available options for a sequel. Miles (or Scarka) is with a new family so lots can happen next but what is more interesting is what can happen with the parents. The father is still alive and we don't know what happened to the mother, she could be dead but she could also be in jail or maybe in a mental institution. An interesting sequel would be of the two parents trying to stop Scarka. Until now they were trying to save their son but now that he's gone they could work together with the doctor to stop the monster everybody else see as an innocent boy. If they ever decide to make a sequel that would be really interesting to watch!",The Prodigy

What could have been a great little horror movie just riffs off every evil kid movie you've ever seen before, from the Exorcist and the Demon Seed to The Orphan. Whilst tiresome jump scares and untied plot strands seem designed to facilitate another franchise like The Conjuring or Insidious. Things start off interesting enough, Miles has violent episodes that he can't remember afterwards, and speaks Hungarian dialect in his sleep. But the movie quickly abandons the very thing that might have made it interesting (ie, the disturbing quality of childhood genius), in favour of standard-issue horror cliches. It may be a well made film, and despite the fact that The Prodigy shows flickers of hope, the over-familiar plot just means it completely misses the mark.",The Prodigy

Reincarnation my ass. That boy needed a good thrashing. But the mother and father were both asinine from day one.

66,bob_meg,"Aside from a couple interesting VFX tricks, zzzzzzzz......",2,25 April 2019,"All good horror is, I think, rooted in what could genuinely happen. Think about it, even The Babadook with it's life size puppets and ruthless anonymous evil entity was just an effective frame for a very real, disturbing prospect --- losing your own child.The trailer for The Prodigy leads you to believe it's a Bad Seed movie, and will engage you in some decent horror and play on some legitimate fears.Don't believe it. In fact, it's tough to believe anything in this film except that all holds are apparently unbarred once you tack on a tired reincarnation plot structure that slowly rots over The Prodigy like a bag of unwanted Halloween taffy apples.I don't think I'm giving anything away here. Most of you will get the gist in the film's first five minutes. You'll know exactly where it's going and along the way you'll get to see some pretty tasteless, unpleasantly graphic stuff. Yes, it's only a movie --- but so was Cannibal Holocaust or Salo, and I'm not lining up to see either of those again soon, even if the first is drive-in detritus and the other an art-house social statement.Let's face it, when you stoop to seeing a child commit these kinds of heinous torture/murder acts, there's something wrong with your head, much less your script. You've written yourself into a corner, or... more likely... there is no intention other than cheap shock, as you also get in a number of really out-there obscene non-sequiters by this child actor (forgot his name, don't really care, it's up there somewhere) who really just does the demon robo-kid routine --- emotionless flat affect = evil.If you're into supernatural schlock it's offensive but passable as a time waster.

70,movieman6-413-929510,"As a viewer, the Prodigy givess a lot of information too early, making the film quickly predictable and long-lasting.",4,10 February 2019,"The Prodigy is a new horror film directed by Nicholas McCarthy, the director of The Pact, Home and Holidays.
In the film, Sarah (Taylor Schilling) has just received her first child. Her son Miles (Jackson Robert Scott) seems to be a special child from a young age with a clever intelligence and a high pain threshold. Furthermore, Miles also shows strange disturbing behavior.
When she has Miles tested, nothing special comes out of the research results. Only a spiritual researcher assumes that two different souls live in Miles. Miles his own soul and the soul of a reincarnated person who has not yet finished his life on earth. This soul belongs to a malicious man who tries to find and kill his escaped victim. Sarah is faced with a choice to help the evil soul and get her son back or to have her son locked up in a special institution so that the evil soul can not do any damage to the world.
This film is quickly told in a predictable way thanks to the information you get as a viewer at the beginning of the film. They could have left this information better from the beginning and could only tell later in the film. So the only question you can have as a viewer while watching the movie is which soul has control of the body of Miles. Usually the events and actions of the characters quickly give away who has the control.
Due to the predictability of the film, the film soon becomes a bit tedious, because as a viewer you know what to expect. For example, the horror moments in the film are not really scary anymore.
It is not clearly explained how reincarnation has happened in the film. It is simply stated that it is reincarnation without further explanation. The same type of horror story about reincarnation has been used in other horror films as in the Child's Play films. In these films, the soul of a murderer has entered an innocent doll by using a voodoo ritual, in order to create further chaos in the world.
The acting is well done by the protagonists. Jackson Robert Scott delivers good acting in this horror film for a young actor. In the remake of the horror film It also provided good acting as the young Georgie. Taylor Schilling also provides good assault as the mother, who is confronted with the two souls in the body of her son and the choices she is faced with. The acting of the two carries the film. The rest of the cast is not very special in the film. This is mainly because their characters have little more to do.",The Prodigy
71,theromanempire-1,Another supernatural child killer movie with it's ups and downs,6,8 February 2019,"This was an interesting effort from the supernatural genre and most specific from the child killer genre which u can place in the category of films like the omen trilogy and stuff like that.
the movie started well then it had a few scenario flaws in the middle of the movie u may be bored kinda and then like 30 last minuted the movie finally explained things and those last minutes were the best part of the movie including a few disturbing scenes with the child killer.
those scenario flaws here and there (like the mother should realize what's really happening a lot sooner than when she did) were important cause those kind of movies need to be as realistic as can be to be...real scary movies.

77,TuesdayThe17th,The occupier,10,8 May 2019,"Top tier killer kid movie and Nicholas McCarthy's best film to date. Following a several year absence from the game, with the exception of his Easter short featured in 2016s ""Holidays""(the film's best and scariest segment), McCarthy comes out with ""The Prodigy"" As her son Miles grows up, Sarah begins to notice his behavior becoming increasingly malevolent. To the right horror audience, this will be a very creepy film, as i would say this film is overall more intensely creepy than actually scary. Nicholas McCarthy always plays with that very dread inducing type of horror. For example, the overall grit and grossness that came with the creepy uncle in the second half of ""The Pact"", the fact that the devil is supposedly wearing the girls skin like a costume in ""At the Devil's Door"", and the JesusXEaster Bunny from his ""Easter"" short. Nicholas McCarthy is one of the best newer voices in horror and ""The Prodigy"" is a must own for fans or raw and serious horror. Had me thinking about it for days. Weeks.

The movie forgot to be scary, tried to be disturbing, but just ended up being kind of icky and angsty. There were a few good ideas but there was no logic to back it up, and the idea itself of possession of something innocent, especially the soul of a serial killer, has already been done a few times (Child's Play and My Soul To Take). It's not a horrible movie, but it certainly isn't a good one either.

79,carlos-pires,Another piece of garbage dressed as a horror movie,1,3 May 2019,"6 to 7 minutes into the film you already know that the serial killer shot by the cops will reincarnate in the baby. First clue of the lameness of the movie is that the boy is born with one brown eye and one blue eye... Then the boy turns out to be a ""prodigy"", but a lame prodigy: while real prodigies are graduating from MIT with honours at the age of 8, this freak is playing with primary-coloured balls and wearing a uniform in an elementary school for gifted idiots.
OK... So 20 minutes into an already fairly challenging crap of a movie, this 8 year old boy who is possessed by the spirit of a Hungarian serial killer spanks another boy with a 3-foot wrench he can barely lift in the middle of a coloured-ball-playing class and then this lady psychologist just gives him a Rorschach test (which is something any serious psychologist hasn't used in the last 50 years) But the boy's mother had taped him talking in his sleep in Hungarian dialect, so she had given the tape to the clueless lady psychologist, who in turn calls upon a paranormal abnormal who is researching this dubious subject. So the two scholarly idiots try to convince the mother that the soul of a bad Hungarian guy is inhabiting her boy's body. But she is not impressed. She doesn't even give a rat's ass about the fact that her little angel has tried to kill another little angel in the middle of a celestial class for gifted suburban idiots.
Particularly distasteful sound editing puts the sound of that famous crow crowing twice inside the sound-proof office (WTF???!!!). That was the fatal blow to my already dwindling suspension of disbelief, and I knew I had to quit watching this idiotic piece of garbage. But, alas!, I gave it another try and... behold: now the family is having dinner and the boy is humming a creepy song at his mom! Holly Antichrist! Can you possibly be any lamer? What a waste of time.
PS: to all the scriptwriters out there: YES, I know that I should check my rational thought at the entrance when I watch an horror movie about demonic possession or whatever, but... THE POINT OF A HORROR MOVIE IS NOT TO TURN THE WHOLE WORLD INTO AN UNBELIEVABLE FAIRYTALE with gifted children in uniform playing with RGB balls and psychologists handing Rorschach tests to kids who try to kill other kids, and crows crowing inside offices.",The Prodigy

86,lucasnochez,Film Review: The Prodigy/www.nightfilmreviews.com,6,12 February 2019,"Horror films have a unique way of having the ability to be wonderfully entertaining while tackling some very important and often sensitive topics that come to surface on a regular basis in our society. Take Jordan Peele's Get Out as an example; the critically acclaimed and perfectly balanced cocktail of suspense, humor and social commentary about a very absurd yet very real perception in modern day America. The film drew heavily on society and the racial trials and tribulations that many ethnic groups face on a daily basis, camouflaging the blunt nature of said beast with talented filmmaking. With The Prodigy, a new horror film directed by Nicolas McCarthy, sets its aim chiefly on childhood, parenting, marriage and the idea of mental health while hitting all its targets like a blunt hammer. The film opens with credits to its distributor Orion Pictures, a nostalgic logo flashes across the screen bringing back memories of The Terminator or Wolfen from 1981, two classics that were distributed by the company; setting the tone for a film with McCarthy successfully taking classic horror film devices and applying them in a modern setting.Nicholas McCarthy's filmography is no stranger to the supernatural, in fact all three of the feature films in his repertoire deal with supernatural material. With his career peaking and a very minimalist approach to undertaking projects and simplistic horror style, its hard to draw comparison within the world McCarthy captures on film. One thing that is for certain is that the world in his newest film The Prodigy is quite spine tingling.The Prodigy revolves around Miles (Jackson Robert Scott), a child who at first, seems to be somewhat of a mad-genius. As Miles' behaviour begins to become more alarming, his parents Sarah and John (Taylor Schilling and Peter Mooney) begin seeking answers, going as far to believing that Miles may be a reincarnation of a soul who has unfinished business, according to the unconventional advise of Dr. Arthur Jacobson (Colm Feore). McCarthy begins turning the film from a story of a young new family into something more reminiscent of The Omen, a Richard Donner classic, a film dedicated to the idea of youthful deviance. The 1976 film is clearly a loved homage by McCarthy and most likely used as a visual example to Jackson Robert Scott during shooting of the film.While The Prodigy doesn't stop with just The Omen as a clear homage, McCarthy's film also pays heavy tribute to William Friedkin's undeniable and most certainly unforgettable horror masterpiece The Exorcist. Using the year 1973 as its reference point, a valiant year in horror cinema, producing cult classics like The Wicker Man, Don't Look Now and The Vault of Horror, the film's title makes it quite clear just exactly what it wants to be and how much these films mean to the filmmakers involved.As cinema and the horror genre begins to evolve in 2019, one of its more interesting and affable characteristics is how it blends plaguing real-world issues into a fun, sometimes spooky yet always entertaining and devilish good time. While many horror films have had sadistic and possessed children, one of my favourite parts of The Prodigy is how it begins with the questions of mental health, learning disabilities (or extreme learning abilities in this instance), and how parents or people would deal with these things. One of the scariest aspects of The Prodigy is imagining this happening to you as a parent? How would you react? What would you do? It is no surprise that many test audiences were so scared and disturbed during the test screenings that the studio had to dilute many of the interactions between Miles and his mother, especially the sequence of scenes where a suspecting Sarah allows Miles to sleep in her bed. As she tenses up and allows her son to climb into bed with her, Miles' hand behind slithering over her shoulder as he whines the words, ""Mommy, will you always love me? No matter what I do?"" I mean, come on, creepy stuff!Conclusively, The Prodigy can stand up in the supernatural, more specifically child supernatural horror movies genre with great pride and valour. A quirky sub-genre that has few bodies of work yet many of the film seem to have certainly left their mark on cinema and horror genre specifically, The Prodigy is a worthy addition to the bunch. Showing immense love to other classic films, The Prodigy uses past techniques in a modern minimalistic setting with superb effectiveness, making the film a familiar but altogether fresh and chilling choice for a film to watch at the multiplexes.",The Prodigy
87,mattfrancis-03963,Disturbing,7,22 May 2021,I tried to hand this a bad rating but it didn't feel right. In comparison to a lot of supernatural horror films this stands out. I wouldn't say it's super scary but you feel kind of nauseated when watching. Some kids believe especially in India like the shrink declared they are reincarnated normally from poorer areas where money is tough to earn and so I usually don't go in for any of that stuff yet there's an eerie element of realism with this and the actress playing the lead mother is absolutely ace. This was disturbing and although parts were a bit boring this was one film which certainly would stick in the memory in terms of its genre and the reviews speak for themselves.

The acting was really good for this type of movie and music/score was creepy. I didn't find it scary but there was a few jump scares (not overused like some here claim) and a lot of tense moments. Story was fairly predictable but with a twist and a unexpected ending. I want to know what that infamous scene was that was edited or reshot that is mentioned here? Apparently the test audience said it was so terrifying the film maker had to either edit it or reshoot it. This scene was supposed to have been shown at the end of the original trailer but everything from both trailers was featured in this movie so unless it was removed from the trailer it doesn't seem to exist. Isn't the point of a horror movie to terrify people? The decision to remove it doesn't work to their advantage & not sure why this film got an R-rating. I hope this supposed scene shows up on the blu ray release or YouTube or somewhere. Or maybe it was all just fabricated by the filmmaker to get people into the theatre to watch this movie who knows.

However, I must mention the fact that he has done some brilliant work as a director for this movie.The director has managed to get a mature and outstanding performance from the child in this movie (J.R. Scott). Taylor Schilling has also given a commendable performance as his mother. I am definitely looking forward to a sequel for this movie.",The Prodigy
102,mbazhome,Not terrible,6,13 July 2019,The story was good. I enjoyed it for what it was. Who cares what the critics think. This movie was not terrible.,The Prodigy
103,eryui,Not as bad as the reviewers say,7,5 April 2020,There are a couple pretty scary original scenes that make you shiver and the tension is high enough throughout the whole film.This movie is in fact more than decent as a horror-thriller and it's underestimated by the current imdb score imho.7/10,The Prodigy
104,RMurray847,Instantly forgettable,4,8 January 2021,"How do I know this movie is forgettable? Well, my wife and I saw it in the theaters (we are suckers for horror movies), and when I saw this Blu Ray advertised for pre-order, I didn't remember seeing the film. Only after I read about the blu-ray did I realize I had actually seen (and disliked) the film.Horror movies always stretch credulity. Not just because we may not believe in the supernatural, but because they are almost always full of silly elements, irrational behavior or the ""rules"" of the supernatural element(s) are not spelled out or not consistent. How limited these problems are and/or how well the movie-makers overcome them (with great visuals, compelling story, great performances, etc.) are what ultimately make a successful horror film.THE PRODIGY missed almost completely. The ending of the film depends entirely on the main character acting stupidly. And recklessly. The visual elements are drab and uninspired. And the usually reliably creepy notion of a homicidal (whether supernaturally or not) child is rendered almost laughable. There are a few moments that give the viewer a small jump or a moment of dread...but nowhere near the frequency or effectiveness needed to allow you to completely set aside your reservations about the film and embrace the fun.It's predictable. It's bland and generic. It's relatively poorly acted and written. It's ending, while admittedly not exactly what I expected, is a blatant play to make room for a sequel and NOT to tie up the story in a satisfying way. The movie hardly made a dent at the box office. It sure doesn't need to make a dent in your wallet now if you're contemplating renting or buying it.",The Prodigy
105,jcslawyer,Not too horrible; not that great,4,1 February 2020,"If you're a horror fan who likes outside the box and unique takes on the genre, then skip this one. I'm not saying that this is the worst movie, I'm just saying that watching it didn't take me to a new place entertainment wise. In fact, it was downright unoriginal and kind of lame on many levels. That being said, it's got a few ok moments and it's ok when you're up for a modern crummy hollywood horror movie. Has a couple decent jump scares and I like that it doesn't have a happy ending. In fact it's a pretty tragic ending...but for pete's sake, please no sequel.The story was cliche and definitely rushed. I think the creepy kid genre is tired af, and this didn't bring anything unique or cool to the table. If you're going to make a movie with a ridiculous premise at least make it work and flow better. The first half felt like bits of the movie spliced together but felt as if there was no direct coinciding with the subsequent scenes. Then, the mom records her son speaking in a foreign tongue while dreaming. She rightfully brings it to his therapist's attention who then feels the next logical step is to call someone who studies reincarnation. It felt like they had to keep this under a certain time, so they removed things that could've made the story a little less forced. I am ok with a longer movie if there's a need for length to help along the story.Sadly though I found it entertaining. I actually fell asleep and debated on whether I was going to just read about the rest or watch it. I opted to watch it and was moderately entertained.I put this in the category of other forgettable thrillers that one day someone will ask if you saw it and you'll need a reminder about it...then you'll say yeah, I remember that...it was ok. Then talk about something else.",The Prodigy
106,byson5186,Awesome Horror Movie,10,13 June 2019,"This movie didn't make much at the box office, and might not be a movie really talked about, but I saw this movie and loved it. After seeing the trailer, I wanted to check this movie out. I'd later rent it on-demand and I was entertained by the whole movie!! I definitely feel like this is an underrated Horror Movie.You'll see from the trailer how the movie involves a kid named Miles Blume who has 2 sides, one of his sides is dark. We find out in the movie what the other side is, but I don't know if I should mention it, it might count as a spoiler. I wasn't sure what his 2 sides were about before watching it? This movie does a good job in showing things from a mental perspective, the inside of the mind. Like what is it with the mind that causes a child to have 2 different sides?What I also thought about this movie, is while a lot of us feel like there aren't enough good kid actors these days, I thought the actor that played Miles did a good job. He's supposed to be an 8-year old boy. I thought he seemed more realistic, and definitely more likable than who has to be the most iconic 8-year old boy movie character ever, Kevin McAllister from Home Alone. Watching Home Alone, I can't help but notice that Kevin's character is meant to be liked but he isn't all that likable, he's a bratty kid and his character doesn't seem all that realistic. Of Course, I'm not here to talk about Home Alone on a Prodigy Review, but I thought of the comparison while watching this and thought Miles seemed more realistic as a character, and his character is more likable than Kevin McAllister's character, even when we see Miles's on his bad side.The movie has breathtaking horror that will leave you clinging on your seat to the very end. It's just a movie I got into, while I feel like a lot of movies that come out nowadays aren't movies I get into. If you're into Horror, I bet you'd like this too.",The Prodigy

108,ryanpersaud-59415,Throughly Average,5,25 April 2021,"The Good: I was pleasantly surprised by this film's restraint and decent script. It didn't have that ""but he's my son!"" contrivance that other evil child movies have (basically where the Mom - it's always the Mom - defends her clearly dangerous child until it's far too late). It also had some pretty decent performances, especially from the main child. He did a good job at essentially playing two different characters.The Bad: It's cinematically bland and lifeless affair, without much action or panache to really keep you invested. It has good moments but nothing makes it more exceptional than an afternoon watch, especially for horror fans.The Ugly: the dark and dreary colour palate. It's so obviously digital and transparent, it kinda took me out of the movie.",The Prodigy
109,VinceGambini,Yes it's horror. It's a horror to watch,1,13 September 2020,"Don't waste your time, this is pure nonsense. The story is ridiculous, but you may get sucked in because the production value is decent. I leave it here because as I said, it's a waste of time. Some movies just don't deserve a review that takes 20 min to write.",The Prodigy
110,ramblingvagabond,There was never any doubt,4,28 April 2020,"If there is one thing we can count on in a horror movie, the ghost/demon/monster/whatever will win in the end. As surely as the sun rises, hollywood absolutely cannot fathom any other ending. From the very first instant the movie started we were on a trajectory with a single destination that was never in any doubt.Think of the greatest horror movies ever made. The Exorcist, Poltergeist, Jaws, The Shining... The good guys won in the end. But modern writers have no clue how to make that happen. It's frustrating because you know how all modern horror movies will end. This piece of trash was no exception.This movie had one good thing about it. ONE. They had a new twist on possession, instead of a demon it was reincarnation. But the rest was a predictable ride through all the stereotypes, tropes and cliches of all the other forgettable horror movies.I wonder if the writers think this is a twist ending. ""In the end, you'd never guess what happens! The boy is still possessed and will go on killing! Everyone will be shocked."" Idiots.",The Prodigy
111,MagicMurderFan,"Meh, just meh.",3,2 February 2020,"Same old boring storyline and the ridiculous progressive parenting. We don't yell or spank, please, I was hoping the kid would murder you. Sweetie, would you like me to take you to kill your last victim? Would that make you happy? I only use positive reinforcement, we don't say ""no"" in this family. The worst part for me was watching a petite 7 year old boy butcher that lady like a porterhouse...seriously, do you have no will to live? The reason this movie got 3 stars is because the kid is adorable and he was a pretty good actor. But overall, both parents deserved to get whacked, due to stupidity.",The Prodigy

Miles is a disturbed kid who complains about having someone occupying his body and doing bad deeds. The story was knit properly till the mid-time when the parents decide to do something about the situation.

If the script was written by the master of suspense, Stephen King, I believe he could make it better. Well, it was not written by Stephen King and so several important sequences of the movie were damaged by the absence of the surprise and the intensity of the fear, thus diminishing the force. Anyway, it was worth watching. I recommend. I like this style of suspense/terror.",The Prodigy
119,helenbassett,The Prodigy Film Review - Nicholas McCarthy Directs Taylor Schilling & Peter Mooney Hoping Their Child Is A Reincarnated WWI Fighter Pilot,7,28 April 2019,"I do enjoy a horror movie and in The Prodigy Nicholas McCarthy plays on the idea of reincarnation, with Taylor Schilling & Peter Mooney as new parents Sarah and John. Baby Miles is born just as serial killer Edward Scarka is shot dead. But Edward has unfinished business. And while Sarah and John are delighted that Miles grows up to be a sweet gifted child, he has other development challenges.Played by Jackson Robert Scott, Miles struggles to relate to kids his own age, with Halloween a sadly solitary evening for him, but a school for gifted children helps. Then one date night a particularly upsetting event happens to the babysitter, with Miles unable to remember anything from the evening. When Sarah hears him babbling in bed that night, she thoughtfully records it. Miles also describes to Sarah what sounds like astral projecting at night, to make room for the other one.It's all a little unsettling for Sarah and John, especially when one day at school he beats another boy with a wrench. What's wrong with Miles? Psychologist Dr Elaine Stresser played by Paula Boudreau, tries to discover, with our little angelic child mentioning that he might be being abused. Loving father John is distraught. But who is the other one that wants to share his body at night?Having left the recording with Dr Strasser, she invites Sarah to come and visit again with a colleague of hers who has had it translated. Colm Feore's Arthur Jacobsen explains it's a little known local dialect from Hungary, with Miles saying despicable things about a woman. Arthur has a special interest in reincarnation and shows a video of a child who is believed to be a reincarnated WWI pilot. If only Sarah and John could be so lucky. We know there is no heroic Ace pilot fighting for control of Miles's body. It's just the fight between sweet Miles and evil Edward. Although I wish I hadn't known this. Maybe figuring out what's wrong with Miles would have been more fun without the dot to dot gun wounds.However a child supernaturally possessed is always a good horror premise, and The Prodigy has plenty of well timed atmospheric jumps, with music by horror alumni Joseph Bishara. And when Sarah promises to always love Miles, no matter what he does, we know that there is worse to come. How far will she go to love and protect her child? Sarah is prepared to go all the way to save Miles. But Paul Fauteux's Edward Scarka is a pathological liar and master manipulator, and Sarah really is barking up the wrong tree. Why, why, why would she do what she does! Unless Edward is subconsciously directing her. And don't all psychopaths love their mummy?, maybe not so much their fathers. And is it Miles we see with Edward's heterochromia eyes, or is it all Edward?Even though we know who is trying to share Miles's young body, scriptwriter Jeff Buhler threw in a few surprises in the 90 minutes, and he wants to hold your hand!",The Prodigy
120,ryan_sy,"Nothing mind-blowing, but a serviceable movie",5,30 April 2019,"The sub-genre of this movie has been done many times before, so it is not original. Expect to see some sophomoric jump scares, eye-rolling character decisions, and a predictable plot. However, the lead performances from the mom and child were believable, and there were a modicum of tense moments. I didn't expect much from this movie, and my expectations were correct. I don't feel like I wasted my time watching, but I don't feel impressed either. The word ""average"" applies well to this movie.",The Prodigy
121,persian-belle,Help troubled children. STOP calling thrm Evil!,1,25 April 2019,"I can't believe in this day and age there are people still watching ""Evil Child"" films. I mean this is pretty much like ""Case 39"", ""The Omen"", ""The Exorcist"" and many similar others.Yes I understand this is entertainment but in my opinion it's a very socially irresponsible one. It's films like this, made about the so-called ""possessed child"", the ""evil witch"", or the ""evil"" ethnic groups that cultivate fear of the unknown in the minds of the uneducated people and give them an unforgivable excuse for murder, for rape, for war...We know that there are troubled children. You see signs of trouble? Take your child to the doctor. Consult a child psychologist. Get a referral for a psychiatrist.

This film takes you into the nursery and gets really emotional and comfortable with you and at one point starts the meat grinder on you!It is unsettling and painstakingly made. Creativity with the camera and music is just as good as the acting and plot. No one had paid me to say these things. I highly recommend this film.I'm unimpressed with Jordan Peele and the director of ""Hereditary."" Pay attention to Nicholas McCarthy, the director of this original film.

The acting (mom and son) is awesome and represents the most praiseworthy element of the movie. Some of the sound effects provoke screaming in the auditorium.

128,padawanmovies,"Not bad, not great",5,13 February 2019,"SPOILERS AHEAD.... I'll basically echo many of the reviews; film had some great moments but came up just short of being really memorable. I didn't see the whole reincarnation angle as some people claim; so I was definitely surprised by that... Was I the only one who felt like the mom got what she deserved? I mean she was so ready and willing to kill the last victim just to ""save"" her son?
I saw this for $7 and thought that was a good price for it. Little Georgie from IT was soo good in this, I had no idea that was him; he was so sinister in this and so vulnerable and adorable in IT. I must reiterate what reviewer Laila said about this being ideal for a sequel: to figure out what happens to the dad, the killer's backstory, and if Miles continues to kill as he gets older, that I would check out. My only cons would be: as mentioned above, Mom's plan to shoot the last victim, why the psychologist had no recording equipment in his office for sessions, how the family didn't get sued after Miles beat a kid with a huge wrench, and why the father would tell Miles his plan to send him away especially after that verbal tirade Miles gave him and after he mentioned he didn't feel safe around him?...

Eight year old boy has the 'soul' of an American-Hungarian serial killer reincarnated within him (beware of hoping reincarnation might be a real possibility!) Why Hungarian? Because of a few events, but mainly because of a researcher into reincarnation who finds out what language dialect the boy speaks in his sleep. Think of The Omen with this movie. Very similar in many ways except this boy isn't possessed by the devil. The killer has come back to complete the killing of one of his victims who survived. Good ending but I'll not spoil any more of it for you! Well worth watching and it's not trash as some seem to think.

Not only was it one cliché mounted upon another cliché mounted upon another, but the talents of such actors as Taylor Schilling (from ""Orange is the New Black), rising talent Peter Mooney, and even the kid, Jackson Robert Scott (Georgie from ""It"") were just wasted.I barely got through the movie and feel pretty ripped off and all I paid was the RedBox price. Thank goodness I didn't see this in the theater.The movie involved reincarnation in an interesting way, perhaps the only thing that wasn't a cliché, but that's about the only thing I can say about it.This movie also falls into the new cliché in the last decade or two that because this is a horror film, the fates of the characters must be dark as well. How this started I don't know. But hello! Does Dracula win at the end? Did the shark in ""Jaws"" survive? Do the exorcists, Lorraine and Ed Warren lose to the entity in ""The Conjuring?"" Does It kill all the kids in the movie of the same name?Of course not! I really want my time back on this one. And I will most probably avoid anything written by Jeff Buhler again because of the ending and despite his satisfactory job with both ""The Midnight Meat Train"" and the new, ""Pet Sematary.""

The storyline, hmmh.. not so much. A dad runs away for a night or two just because he had an argument with his kid, and left the mother with the son. What an easy escapism for a parent?!

180,sugarnspices,Meh...,3,13 May 2019,"I remember seeing previews for this movie and then never heard about it again. Should have been a sign when I was then surfing Redbox, but I'm willing to give movies a shot that are basically straight to dvd release, I've been pleasantly surprised before. The Prodigy was not one of those times.This movie lacked a real ""heart"" and solid ground storyline that could then be grown upon and shaped into a horror or thriller movie to stand alone on its own two feet.Issues I had:The passing/skipping of this movie. We go from birth to 8/evil within the first 10 min. I realize they wanted to show the beginning evil man being murdered/Miles being born to cover the soul jump, but was that 3 min scene really necessary? Could they not have had that be researched and found later on? Or could they not have then showed a progression of Miles being evil throughout his life? With such a time jump and being thrown straight into the movie, there is 0 to none character development. What do we have when there is no character development? Lack of care of our characters and their journey/stories. I could care less about this family. The dad is barley even in it to start, I thought maybe they would make the evil soul be his father, Miles grandfather, explaining the soul jump. But no, it is only alluded he had a POS dad so he could then be absent throughout Miles' transformation. The whole movie is way too choppy, like they rushed at the end and just threw scenes together to make the final cut.Speaking of, the soul jump. It is completely random and does not make any sense other than Miles being born when the evil man dies. There is no common thread there, complete and utter strangers. None. Zip. Made for no real impact on whose soul was in him or why.Soul jumping. We go from a therapist to a what I can only assume an ""expert"" in this soul jumping within a scene. No discovering, no research, no doubt or other theories. ""My son has a problem, listen to what he said in his sleep"" to ""He has an evil soul in him, seen it before, you have to let the evil soul/person finish his business before you can have your son back."" Period. The mom does not believe it at first; but what do you know? Within the next scene she is a firm believer, I think bc of the jump scene of Miles having a man head or something. Yawn.The dog. I am so sick of ""scary"" moves killing the family dog. It's been done. It's played out. It's annoying. Leave the dead horse alone. The second I saw the dog, I said it will be murdered. Why? Bc it has to. Why? Ummm, I don't know stupid directors, you tell me why? Just to emphasize how ""evil"" your characters are. Boring and over it, it's actually become a movie pet peeve for me these days. Come up with something new, you dud.The ending.

First the writing leaves it with the need for a sequel now its a matter if the people want a sequel. The writing was poor the set ups were either so easy to see coming or just plain stupid. I gave 5 stars only because of the potential of a better movie coming out in the sequel. You need new writers ones who are going to surprise you with scenes and better acting. If you get a writer who wrote something like the 6th sense . The fact with this movie your option are only limited to your imagination. There was not one scene in this movie were you said i did not see that coming. There was no scene that made you go OMG there was no scene that had you on the edge of your seat. I also was wondering how this kid would pop up in the hall or in front of them when they were watching out for him ? This was bad writing unless he had the power to show up or disappear i honestly feel this movie was just lazy writing and some bad acting here is hoping if there is a sequel they hire good writers and bring in some good actors.,The Prodigy

Mama bear lost any respect the moment she essentially tried to allow a serial killer to murder again in a very ill conceived plan that she hopes will lead to the spirit of the killer to leave her sons body.

You have to have a 70 IQ to do that. Lately movies are just getting dumber and dumber. Not worth watching for free, let alone for money! The choices nowadays are either low iq movies like this one or pretentious pseudo-psycho movies with various sci fi aberrations proclaiming they are high IQ when in fact they are lower IQ than this movie.

I'm glad I saved the money.I love horror films - even the bad, tacky and cheesy films. But even the bad ones I enjoy, they still try new things. ""The Prodigy"" does absolutely nothing new with the premise.A serial killer's soul takes over a child.

The mother knows her son needs help? Check.
The child manipulates the psychologist? Check.
The mother and father argue after the kid threatens the father? Check.
The mother tries getting the child a different form of help? Check.
The father wants to have their son committed for obvious reasons? Check.
The child tries to kill the husband? Check.I swear that there's a checklist out there where mediocre horror directors just go down saying, ""We need to do all of these cliches. Like...all of them."" Even the ending is stereotypical of bad movies. I won't spoil it, but if you think of every bad horror film and how they end, you'll know. There's never a resolution.

The story could've benefited from a lot of trimming on dialogues and by toning down a few over the top scenes. And this is not done by the acting; everyone - even the child actor - is well on screen. They're genuinely connected, and because of their sharp portrayals, most of the good scares work, even when we know they're coming. No, most of this feeling comes with the script.

207,will-05196,Hamfisted and clumsy exposition,3,3 July 2019,"The film pays a good deal of attention to its sadistic thrills such as the glass on staircase scene. Suffers a bad case of ""information dump"". Clunkily jerks through revelations with no artistry or progression, showing a confused handling of timeline. Fails the difficult task of balancing narrative tension with revealing the background mystery. Many viewers will not be discerning enough to care, I'm cursed not to be in that large happy club of the easily pleased.The mother's character was cookie cutter, probably through no fault of the actress - she was certainly poorly written / directed. She lurches from rejection / acceptance (and back again) of the prospect of a possessed son with clumsy puppet string jerks of hamfisted directing. Basically, her main job in this film is to pull concerned faces of varying severity while serving as a prop for the evil child. Wife / husband dynamics likewise are handled in a rushed off-hand fashion, with insufficient time and care given to character development. They were cutouts for their role as props to the evil child. The shrink guy (or whatever he was exactly) was shoe-horned in, in a rush, to dump large undigestable chunks of plot information and backstory in a few unconvincing passages of dialogue.Evil child suffers a common horror movie flaw of being omnipresent ""Always One Step Ahead!"" To me this is the lamest and most fatal commonly found trap horror flicks fall into and is frankly laziness and lack of real story-telling skill, as is a reliance on jump-scares, which this film also suffers from.What could have been a pretty well done, although by no means original, creeper is a bland, tired, uninteresting and uninspiring phoned in effort despite the star of the show, the evil kid, doing a pretty good job in his role. Almost everything else in this thing is remarkably forgettable. A good example of a movie attempting to bypass the standards other genres demand of it because it has the horror tag, and a reminder of when horror movies bother to do the ""small"" stuff well, they are the most memorable of films. You don't get a pass from the discerning viewer who won't be distracted from the standards of story-telling by jump-scares alone, try harder.",The Prodigy

The director has a good sense of the narrative aspects, he knows when to use some resources to provoke tension, the fotography is very charming and the director has a good notion of the passage of the time offering some good timings Wich contributes to the crescendo of the tension.
Now talk about the story point I must say that it isn't very good. The decision to let the audience know about the supernatural bond between the main character and the murder is a big mistake because doesn't give the public to feel some kind of challenging to understand for themselves if in fact the weird stuff that the child does has a rational or supernatural explanation. Now if we have already that knowledge the only thing that might provoke tension is some moments where we expect the child to do something, but despite that kind of tension initially work, when the movie finally progresses that resource becomes useless.
And despite all the clues your still in doubt if is some supernatural or not, when one of the first accident happen, instead of going to a doctor and do all the psychologyc test that a normal person would do the picture wants so badly to tell more that it should that it puts right of the top some specialist that tells everything about the kid problem, killing all changes to develop other kind of tension.
To be honest I don't think the movie is terrible, but it contains a lot of narrative errors that downgrade the experience turning this movie into some basic that no one will remember.",The Prodigy

I liked most of it but some parts were just too much for me like when the father lashes out due to his son's disturbing and uncontrollable behavior.

217,marshallfg,Much Better Than I Expected (Possible Spoiler Alert),6,12 February 2019,"After reading so many negative or apathetic reviews of this film I expected to sleep through a good portion of it or end up demanding my money back. To my surprise, the movie wasn't nearly as bad as I'd expected, and it managed to keep me engaged to the very end. I can't say that about most of the horror movies I've seen lately.
There's not a whole lot of mystery to what was going on with this little boy, and not long into the movie the problem is clearly spelled out, so I don't think a spoiler alert is in order here. A serial killer gets reincarnated into the body of a child at the time of his death. Why this boy is unclear, but okay. How this is demonstrated was pretty clever, I thought, if not a little awkwardly executed. The killer, realizing he's surrounded by cops and his victim (that he could possibly have used for leverage - or a shield) has escaped, decides to surrender. But before doing so, he decides to disrobe and wander outside in his birthday suit. He's hiding something behind his back that the cops think is a gun (turns out it's the victim's hand), so they open fire. As he's riddled with bullets, we see a baby being born in another state somewhere, naked of course, with blood stains in the exact locations as the killer's bullets. Get it?
Pretty clever, I thought. What made the scene awkward was that there was no apparent reason for the killer to take his clothes off before surrendering, but okay. One theory is that he was a total nutjob. Another most likely theory is that the writers didn't want anybody to miss the transference. Or both.
We're told the child, named Miles, is some kind of genius with very little evidence (he can say ""mama"" after a few months), but okay. But his social skills clearly leave much to be desired. He doesn't interact with the other kids and begins to manifest a disturbing violent streak early on. Strike that, throwing temper tantrums and hitting are disturbing. Nearly beating a kid to death with a pipe wrench should have brought about a lawsuit, and what to do with Miles should have been taken out of the parents' hands, but okay. Other clues that something wasn't right with Miles were fairly subtle. He develops a penchant for paprika. He speaks gibberish in his sleep that is later identified as Hungarian, which he's never learned. Bad things seem to keep happening whenever he's around.
How the parents react to Miles's behavior pretty much drives the film from then on and begs the question: How far should parental love go to protect a clearly troubled child, and at what point do you decide that a child as just plain evil? Dad's role in the film is pretty minimal. He never goes to any of the counselors his wife insists on taking Miles to, and he seems willing to get Miles removed from the home early on. This seems unusually cold until we learn about his history of growing up in an abusive home. While he clearly wants to be nothing like his abusive parent, he's clearly struggling with anger management issues of his own. Miles effectively uses this struggle to neutralize his dad's involvement by putting him under suspicion of child abuse, even causing his own wife to question him, and then pushing his buttons every chance he gets. I thought that was pretty clever.
While the dad is easily ready to put Miles away somewhere, the wife not so much. And yes, she finally finds an expert who's able to tell her what's wrong with Miles which she dismisses. But let's give her some credit. If a ""therapist"" told you your child's been possessed by the spirit of Jack the Ripper, for example, would you believe it? So her initial disbelief is perfectly understandable. Keep in mind also that the parents had tried for some time to conceive a child, so it's natural for them to want to give him the benefit of the doubt. Also, Miles himself was not evil. He was just as scared and confused by what was going on as she was. It would have been different if Miles himself was intentionally doing evil. Miles - or the killer's spirit - makes short work of the therapist, leaving Mom and Dad on their own to take desperate measures.
The final scene, where Mom makes a last ditch effort to save her son from this evil spirit, was the most unsettling part of the whole movie, even though the audience was set up to see it coming. The serial killer clearly had a screw loose somewhere, but Mom's actions were well thought out. At every step of the way her conscience was begging her not to do it, but she plunged ahead anyway. Far-fetched? Maybe. Emotionally effective? For me it sure was.
My only beef was the overly drawn out ending and the setup for a sequel, which went against why the killer possessed the boy in the first place.

He didn't seem important and he really wasn't, he was there to fill dialog and an extra problem later in the story, which could have easily been avoided if he didn't talk to his son/not son in the car.

I guess they exist. Adam Lanza's mom bought her son guns and left bullets scattered around in peanut cans. So anything's possible, I suppose.2. Are parents like these really representative of normal suburban folk? I often felt like I was playing a Scary Movie parody in my head when they failed to question and react to strange things the kid said and did... and their knee jerk rejection of any explanation that seemed ""weird."" It's not that I subscribe to the weirdness, but give me a kid like Miles, and all bets are off. I'll consider whatever information that comes my way, fast and early.

226,frobrojkt,"Decent idea, poor execution",5,4 June 2019,"The idea / plot of the film had potential. However the that didn't really translate onto the screen. Creepy little kids have been a staple in the horror genre for years and years, as has the idea of possession. ""The Prodigy"" plays upon both of those ideas through the medium of reincarnation. Initially this caught my interest but it just didn't have enough substance to keep me, the viewer, interested. It seems like the filmmakers could not decide which of the several logical directions to take the film. So they then settled on a hodgepodge of the most stereotypical aspects of each. The film is dreadfully predictable and seems to bank on the overused ""jump scare"" and the shock of kinda unnecessary levels of blood / gore.
While the young actor for Miles is good especially for his age, there is no family dynamic. Both parents seem miscast. There is no familial relationship between the husband or wife, nor with Miles their son.

I had to move quickly to watch this movie as it was only showing for two weeks at my local complex. Why such a short time?
This is a really immersive film that had me riveted to the cinema seat through all the twists and turns. Now I know what 'jump scares' are and they are fun/frightening but the really good sound quality available in a cinema is a must for the full effect.
Taylor Schilling was superb as the Mum, Sarah, and I felt real empathy with her character in dealing with her gradual realisation that something was seriously amiss with her son Miles mental state. I was very impressed with the maturity and conviction that Jackson Robert Scott was able to give to the son's evil role then apparently go off the set and play like any eight year old.

You can see and feel the work and endeavor to achieve the highest possible quality for this movie. The acting is also a strong point. I loved watching the stressed and panicing parents, who do not know what to do, as well as the kid has superb facial expressions to play both innocent as well as a creepy maniac.What I did not like on the other hand are the cliches and cheap jumpscares. Also the story makes no sense at many points. The kid beats up another kid with a wrench, yet everything remains normal and he can still go to school. The father is stabbed by his son before the car accident, yet noone cares about this. Why does noone tie the kid up, when it is certain that he is a reincarnation of a murderer? Also the ending... Who is that guy in the orchard? Why does he shoot and kill on sight with out warning? From my point of view nor his presence nor his actions make any sense.

276,jjunebb,A little better that the current ilk of horror movies,6,10 March 2020,"A nasty little offering about a boy possessed by the spirit of a serial killer. At first the boy appears to have genius qualities but as he grows up the spirit take control, creating mayhem and causing his shellshocked parents into separation. A misguided counsellor, and a nutty reincarnation expert are used to explain his condition, but the overwrought mother, for some reason, never passes the evidence on to his father.
The Prodigy moves at a steady pace with some grisly and disturbing surprises along the way.
As with many of the new made for television crop, the characters are never fleshed out, leaving the viewer indifferent to their fate, in particular the lacklustre father who is a lifeless prop.
The acting is a little stitled, the background music is grating, there are holes in the plot and it has a cheap look; In evidence is the leeching of colour, seen in the current glut of these movies, and lack of lighting expertise. Whether this is deliberate or due to the filming technique, the resulting muddy look flattens the picture and diminishes the shocks and special effects.
With a little imagination and nuance a film can be brought to life.
The Prodigy is better than many of its contemporaries, and is sure to leave a sour taste in your mouth.

I'll give them that, but again, as another ones said in here, it fails miserably down the line. 1st, it's a f...n 8 year old kid. At some point in time, possessed kids were scary. Mostly because you couldn't record what they were doing, but now, a hipnose doctor would simply not record a session and being threatened of child molesting. A mother and father wouldn't simply ignore all the signs that there is something wrong with the kid, specially when he clearly hits another with a wrench. I'm not saying you'll take the kid to an exorcist, but there is now-a-days, special clinics for violent behaviour in children, and this parents simply ignored everything, from start to finish, and end up dead in the most stupidiest of ways. Let's face it, you know your kid has a problem, you have to take him to a clinic, and you go wining out loud in the car, with a violent kid in the back seat?? Wtf?? Then, you take your serial killer possessed kid to his last victim in order for him to finish the job? As if the victim hasn't suffered enough already? To save your son you're going to kill a totally innocent person who just wants be left alone?

This movie was a pleasant surprise , my first impressions after seeing the trailers was this is going to be another cliche creepy kid movie with demon possession, Devilish heritage we have seen a billion times "" The Omen"", "" Rosemary's baby"". This one had some twists and interesting plot devices to mess with are regular conception of what this type of film is supposed to be. First off the acting was amazing the boy Miles Blum played by Jackson Robert Scott was spectacular, child actors have always been the crux of Hollywood filmmaking but in this genre so much more pressure on them. Jackson was able to portrait and very above average kid as well as a psychopath that fluctuates in intensity at the right times throughout the movie. The rest of the acting was great but special props to a stand out performance by Jackson. This movie uses a very interesting premise for the supernatural influence on Miles in fact I don't think it's ever been suggested to work this way before, I may be wrong about this but I can't think of any-other movie that works this way. Besides for that much of the film does tend to fall into the cookie cutter creepy kid movie. the subtle homage to other horror films however was nice to see as well. From the gritty and nasty slasherific begging to the artistic visuals that give us that familiar feeling of horrors of the past, this one give us some nostalgia. I did love the ending of this film I am a sucker for this kind of ending I won't give anything away here but I could see a lot of criticism attacking this film because of the ending but I for one love it. If you have kids this movie will hit you a little differently, the beginning will be filled with questions we as parents can understand easily. Are we raising them right?, what can we do to make there life better?. as well of the fear of are children being sick or afflicted or mistreated, these are powerful emotions for us as parents and the audience travels through while watching this film. but the biggest question how far would you go to try and protect and save your child? this movie takes that to an extreme limit but the question remains. This was a fun watch and I hope others give it a chance, I feel horror fans will appreciate this more than regular audiences so if you are a horror fan add this to your list to check out this year. As far as criticism for this movie I do feel there was an opportunity to really change the game for the horror genre that wasn't taken I would explain but it might spoil some things while viewing the movie so I wont and it is a good idea so maybe I will write it myself LOL.",The Prodigy

Sure, the characters made some awful decisions here or there (the mom comes to mind) but I also don't have experience in having a serial killer of Hungarian descent infiltrating my child's soul so I can't really be the judge.) and the cinematography was pretty flat for most of the movie, I was still entertained by the story. I like that they went the route of having the serial killer reincarnating into Miles instead of your typical demon infestation which always leads to weak third acts. This was a little more original even though a quick editing transition in the first five minutes clues you in on what's about to occur. There are some fun scares here and there which is really why we're all here; and a surprising lack of jump scares was nice although they were there. The movie is of course carried on the shoulders of our two leads, Miles and his mother, and they portray their characters with pride. As a Star Wars prequels fan, I know a bad child actor when I see one and this movie didn't have a single one. The ending was fantastic and not entirely predictable and reminds me of a Sam Raimi movie in that nobody really gets what they want in the end. Well... almost nobody.

Among bad horror movies there are these that truly have some scary moments but are ruined by, for example, bad ending, or have some other major flaw which makes them, let's say, half-bad and I would give them 5 stars. Second group of bad horror movies are ones that someewhere somewhereee in the distance had potential but NOTHING truly really worked out. These are three or four star movies. The Prodigy goes to that group. Three stars, in this case, go for cinematography, nothing for other stuff.
I see potential here far far away in the foggy horizon but, unfortunately everything here was unsuccessful. First and foremost, the cast for the kid was just plain wrong. He is supposed to scare anyone ? Come on. Linear and predictable story, characters you don't care about (for example the father), creepy scenes are not creepy at all, and I can go on and on...

I can't really explain it without spoiling things, but everything was okay up until the mom decided to finally ""do something"" about Miles.Instead of doping the kid on Dramamine and planning to kill the woman herself, she should have gotten on the kid's level, as in, he was clearly not her son but this adult serial killer, and so she comes to him with a plan to help him get what he wants, which is killing the one that got away.They get discuss how he needs to do it, and mom plays along, and then once the plan is set, she gets in touch with the woman and tells her what is going on. They could have even expanded on the hypnotist's part, by bringing him back in to corroborate the mom's story about reincarnation and that the serial killer was indeed in control. So they plan to stage the event so that it appears to be Miles as dead serial killer, murdering his final girl. Only let's have mom talk the guy into killing her in a way where they can fake it.Fake out the serial killer, everyone's happy...except wait, Miles still isn't coming back, it must be because he knows it wasn't real...only it's not because the kill wasn't real, it's because the dominant soul had too much time to take over and eradicate the child's soul.Though, I personally believe that in this instance (or in all instances of reincarnated souls inhabiting the same space as an occupied body's soul really), the soul isn't gone, it's just been diminished to a size too small to overcome the dominant soul...it is all just energy and energy can't be destroyed.Overall, I liked it, it was interesting and held my attention, and some of the moments were very *cover the eyes* kind of times, but I think it knew what it wanted to do, but didn't know how to pull it off.

326,ekaldaine,Too predictable,6,3 June 2019,"From the moment we learned reincarnated souls come back due to unfinished business, I knew the murderer came back to finish killing his escaped victim. Yet it somehow took the main character (the mom) 30 more minutes or so of the movie to figure this out. Riiiiiight. And then it became super obvious she'd try to kill the escaped victim herself as a chance to get her son back - I guessed she'd do that OR take the killer in her son's body to the woman to let him do it. And guess what? She essentially did both.When it's that predictable that you're guessing things way before they happen, watching the rest of the movie is just tedious. I give it 6 stars because I don't think the movie was bad, and I think the acting was pretty solid (especially for the little boy; he's super talented).",The Prodigy
327,cweyer-67805,It's fine,7,17 February 2019,"Look, it's not a perfect movie. I went in with low expectations, and came out relatively pleased. The performances are mixed, and can get strange at times, but are good enough when they need to be. There are a few scenes of great tension, which are given a good amount of time to be built up. And jump scares are minimal, which is nice to see for a change. And the concept is unique, and handled fairly well.I'm not a huge fan of horror, but this movie obviously tried; it simply failed in a few areas, specificity in its plot. But if you are looking for a good popcorn flick, I'd recommend seeing it. Everyone's reviews are fairly negative, and with good reason, but it shouldn't stop you from seeing it if you think it looks intriguing.",The Prodigy

There a a few ok jump scares but that's about it.But the plot holes are ludicrous1) The hypnosis session is not taped or videoed - come on!!! A lazy omission to allow the boy to threaten he was sexually abused
2) No one seemed to notice that the father was stabbed - quite viciously - just before the crash.
3) Also did no one realise the father's head injuries were so severe because his seat belt had been cut through with a blade!
4) His father survived - so take a guess at what he is going to say about the crash when he recovers - OK if he remembers!.Overall it was predicable and been done before - but better.",The Prodigy

Unfortunately, this movie did not deliver for me. There were only two scary shots, one which was in the trailer. Furthermore, the movie explained way too much, way too soon for me, following a standard formula without any true twist. There wasn't anything to second guess, no 'did he or didn't he?', no other explanations or roads explored. A very straightforward movie that wasn't all that scary. Disappointing.",The Prodigy

I couldn't figure out what language they were trying to speak until they claimed it was hungarian, then I had to watch the scene several times in order to understand what he said. It was trying to be hungarian, and I understand that it's a really hard language for anyone to speak, especially the child actor who had to learn his lines, but they could've tried harder. Also, I don't know what they intended to do with the killer's name, because I think it was supposed to be a hungarian surname, but it was not. We have the surname Szarka, but he was called Scarka, I believe? In Hungary we do not use the ""c"" as a ""k"" sound under any circumstances, hence this couldn't have possibly been a hungarian name at all. Maybe they were trying to make his name Szarka?

If actors were asked to make a parody of a horror movie, this would be it.
The decisions that were made, the details, everything was so off, so remote from what normal people would ever do, that it just did not instill a reality in this movie. It did not feel like a supernatural thing was happening to the family.

However, I believe that one reason we are all so quick to dismiss the idea is because we live in a postmodern society that readily dismisses anything that is spiritual or supernatural. We have been taught that ideas such as reincarnation are absurd because they aren't in the realm of possibility.

I am not a film officianado by any means, but I do have to say this is one of the best I have seen in a while as a thriller. From the previews, it was different than I expected or maybe assumed, and I was pleasantly surprised.It seems some other reviewers consider it as a sci fi thriller, and I do not share their opinions. Instead, if you watch it with an open mind & out of western ideals, perhaps you may see it differently as well. I am a ""country bumpkin,"" as my husband calls me, but I also respect other cultural ideas and do not poo poo them simply because they don't fit the mold here in the US.There are predictable parts here and there, but overall I found it to be very good.

This move however did, I stopped it half way through because of this, I do not care if they are trying to make a point about the main character, they could have done it in a more roundabout way regarding the dog, there was absolutely no need for them to show the blood, the mother undoing the wood board to see the dead dog. Disgraceful, unnecessary, the story-line was doing well without the need for this. I am so disappointed I wasted my time watching half of this movie, it had potential.

383,hewlet-02509,Not perfect but still pretty good,9,10 February 2019,"Overall I thought it was pretty good movie (I've definitely seen worse). Two biggest complaints are that I wish there was an air of mystery as to what was wrong with the little boy-but they tell you what's wrong right away and it takes a while for the parents to figure out (while the audience knows right away) Although I do admit that the way the did the opening sequence was clever so I do give credit where credit is due.Other smaller critiques are that I feel like the movie could have been better if they expanded some scenes. Just as a good suspenseful scene gets going it would cut away to the next scene leaving the audience hanging. As a result, I found the movie to be more dark and creepy than actually scary. I also think it could have benefited it would have been longer as well because some scenes seemed rushed. I also did not like how it ended-but it did leave it open for a possible sequel (or maybe a franchise if they play their cards right). To be honest though, i may not bother watching a sequel (as I said the ending ruined it for me) . I thought Taylor Schilling was terrific. She definitely needs more roles like this and I think it's proof that OITNB has severely underused her talent. Jackson Robert Scott did an amazing job as well.His ability to transition between 2 very different characters was certainly impressive. I hope he has a good career ahead of him.",The Prodigy

The film contains thriller and horror elements, it feels like a blend. The cast is solid and Taylor Schilling and Jackson Robert Scott especially were a great match. The biggest and for me personally most annoying cliché ('my kid would NEVER do that' / insert surprised face emoji) is pretty much avoided here, and that gives it a genuine feel plus a hurrah from me. Director Nicholas McCarthy included a couple of very nice shots. The dark introduction scene and the wide shot of Miles in Halloween outfit felt to me like classic horror scenes and make you wonder 'what is going on?' I would like to see McCarthy also try something a little less supernatural with more character depth. In this case especially, I was interested in learning more about the main character and their motivation. Overall, I enjoyed it!

390,dennislovegirls,Up for a horror movie? Watch something else.,1,24 February 2019,This movie was so bad. I wish I spent my time on anything else.,The Prodigy
391,abdullahbq-45089,This movie is so nice!,7,9 February 2019,It's so nice and does have jump scares!!! This is the first time I review something! Because it's so nice! Its not so horror but it does scare you a bit!! You should really watch it,The Prodigy
392,lunalight-18087,It HAD potential,3,19 May 2019,"If the first scene where we learned about the killer and his motives were kept hidden until the third act it would have been a much better movie. I also found the to be movie too short and rushed. Instead of the dad getting angry at Miles for saying horrific things and not listening he should have told his wife right away so they could have worked together.
The scene with the hypnotism was the best scene in the film. I'm disappointed.",The Prodigy
393,zubairgulmangi,Expected movie with pathetic conclusive n,3,9 May 2019,"Movie start with birth of a baby, on same day a murderer was encountered by police so his soul reborn in the the body of baby, as baby was growing, the murders soul was evolving, in the baby killed his parent as well as a girl which was flew away from him in his previous life. End. There was a new concept but I m shocked how horribly they ruined the movie......!",The Prodigy
394,ericjardine-34177,Young Sheldon's GONE NAUGHTY,9,10 February 2019,"I have so many unanswered questions, If you genuinely enjoy films with lots of twists and weird old people this is for you. Sometimes I think I need a wrangler after I've had 15 shots, but this boy outta control! HE LIKES PAPRIKA! Oh lord call the cops, huge warning sign the boy likes a little kick to that dry chicken. Maybe that's why he went crazy. Also when the kid finessed the hell out of that hypnotist wouldn't he have videocameras in there just in case? I don't wanna over critique this (there's no holding back, I think I've got a bit too much paprika in my system) but why not just over power the kid? He may have the mind of a 57 year old but you could restrain him he doesn't gain magical strength. Maybe spark the hell ouf of him too for tearing apart that expensive baby cam. Overall enjoyed it I just have a few concerns, I rate it 9 glass shards in my foot out of 10.",The Prodigy
395,gyoung-32496,Mediocre,3,10 February 2019,"It was a predictable mediocre movie, with average editing and shot composition. My only gripe is that you get a face full of baby peen in the first five minutes, it is way bigger than mine and completely ruined the mood turning a 5/10 movie into a 3/10 movie. I hope that in the dvd release they change the scene so that I can get back what little dignity I have left.",The Prodigy
396,wolfgang-00204,Just cheap jump scares,5,8 February 2019,Just a really boring movie that relied solely on cheap jump scares. And in the and all of them were expected. Don't get me wrong there were a few scenes that felt deeply disturbing but in the end there wasn't enough of them. Best yhing about the movie is acting and some well shot scenes.,The Prodigy
397,peronnesmanuel,It's difficult to watch and not in a good sense,6,7 April 2019,My expectations were low walking into this film and I found it surprisingly suspenseful. The acting in the film was overall really good. The film had to squeeze quite a bit into a 92 minute runtime so it felt a bit rushed and some random scenes were in there for really no reason because of it. The mystery behind what was going on was very intriguing and kept me in the film the entire time. But I felt that it could've been explained a lot better because the explanation we got was very vague.,The Prodigy
398,grohermann,Classic horror movie for genre lovers!,7,9 February 2019,"First of all I gotta admit that I have not seen the movie yet however I love the genre and know exactly what to expect from it tho. The movie is as simple created as its basic story itself. A young child who doesn't really fit the image of what the society would expect from him to be. Just as in real life outsiders are often more vulnerable to get victimized in certain ways including ending up in sects or like in that case becoming obsessed. Whenever something is taking over someones thoughts and actions without really knowing of what's going on it simply scares people especially when the conjured or obsessed one is a cute child. In fact a young cute looking boy is getting conjured and starts killing people isn't one of those things someone would expect to happen. As a matter fact it may be considered as to be one of the oldest deepest fear in all of us as we would never expect a child to become a serial killer for what reason ever! The Prodigy maybe isn't the best horror movie ever done but it's definitely a well entertaining classical movie such as ""the omen"" orphan"" ""the conjuring"" or even ""Annabelle"". what clearly does have its rights to be shown in movie theaters and will become one of the more successful horror movies in 2019. Most likely not as good as
""It chapter 2"" but still a good one what definitely gets my recommendation.",The Prodigy
