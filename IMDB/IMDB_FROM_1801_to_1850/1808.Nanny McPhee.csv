0,TheLittleSongbird,Lively colourful and entertaining!,8,8 September 2009,"Nanny McPhee is an example of a film where I was put off by the trailers, but I am glad I saw the film, because it is a lively, well meaning and very colourful film. Not to mention entertaining... there are some very amusing scenes in the early parts of the film, with the children, who all gave spirited performances. The costumes and sets are very colourful, with beautiful vivid colours, perhaps a bit too much at times, but you can't deny the look of the film was lovely. The script was absolutely delightful, very lively and entertaining. But what made this film was the performance of Emma Thompson, who was just terrific. As was Colin Firth, and I thoroughly enjoyed Angela Lansbury's turn as an elderly aristocrat. The ending was easily the best scene of the film, the visuals were just amazing in that scene, and the music by Patrick Doyle was fun too. However, adults may get tired of some of the jokes, and there are some slow moments in the middle half, but I commend the film for its messaging, that were well meaning and thoughtful. All in all, a very enjoyable film, perhaps more for children, but adults will like the visuals and Emma Thompson. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Nanny McPhee
1,SnoopyStyle,She ain't no Mary Poppins,6,29 December 2013,"Mr. Brown (Colin Firth) is a recently widowed father of seven children. The kids hate all nannies and have become experts at running them off. More than anything, they fear that they will have an evil step mother like in the fairy tales. In desperation, Mr. Brown listens to a mysterious voice and asks for Nanny McPhee. Her rule is ""When you need me but do not want me, then I must stay. When you want me but no longer need me, then I have to go."" Also great aunt Lady Adelaide Stitch (Angela Lansbury) who financially supports Mr. Brown is now demanding he remarry by the end of the month.The kids are annoying brats. I guess that's the point of the movie. Kelly Macdonald is the only real likable character as the servant Evangeline. This is one ruckus kids movie that I'm not sure kids will like. Nanny McPhee is no Mary Poppins. And which kids like to watch other wild kids being disciplined. But in the end, I think they will like all the wild craziness on the screen.",Nanny McPhee
2,nogodnomasters,Oglinton Fartworthy,9,22 May 2019,"I would say this is a must watch movie for anyone who has children in that 5-10 year old bracket. Mr. Brown loved his wife very much (7 kids in about 10 years.) His children are precocious and have been running off nannies. Finally the facially blemished Nanny McPhee shows up at their doorstop and takes charge of the household, using a certain amount of magic.Mr. Brown maintains his home because of money supplied by his wife's aunt. She insists he must marry by month's end or lose the money. So he contacts Mrs. Quickly, (this is another story where names have meanings) and asks her to marry him against his children's wishes.The children, who first view Nanny McPhee as an adversary, change their point of view to accept her. Emma Thompson stars in this movie as well as wrote the screen adaptation for herself (must be really getting tough to get roles). The acting was good and this is a movie adults will enjoy watching with their children.By modern standards, I think it smokes Mary Poppins.",Nanny McPhee
3,jboothmillard,Nanny McPhee,5,2 April 2008,"Obviously this is one for the kids, I guess I was mainly interested in the cast more than much else. Basically the Brown children are very naughty, they have managed to get rid of 17 nannies, and the agency is closed to their dad Mr. Cedric Brown (Colin Firth). Then comes along comically ugly governess Nanny McPhee (Emma Thompson, also doing the screenplay) who has a rule that when she's needed not wanted she'll stay, and when she's wanted not needed she'll leave. The children have to learn the five basic rules of behaviour with the help of Nanny McPhee's magic stick, and when they do, she loses a bit of her ugliness. The children should worry that their Aunt Adelaide (Angela Lansbury), who is basically paying for their health and stuff, wants Mr. Brown to marry to keep getting cash, and Mrs. Quickly (Celia Imrie) is the wrong choice. In order, the rules: get into bed when told, get out of bed when told, get dressed when told, listen, and do as your told. In the end, Mr. Brown marries his true love, the maid they got to pretend to be his oldest daughter, Evangeline (Trainspotting's Kelly Macdonald), and Nanny McPhee is pretty and can leave. Also starring Derek Jacobi as Mr. Wheen, Patrick Barlow as Mr. Jowls, Imelda Staunton as Mrs. Blatherwick, Love Actually's Thomas Sangster as Simon and Eliza Bennett as Tora. It is a good new twist on Mary Poppins. Worth watching!",Nanny McPhee
4,ccthemovieman-1,"Extremely Colorful, A Fun Film Enchanced By Emma's Title Role",9,14 August 2007,"This was a pleasant surprise, much better than I anticipated. I figured Emma Thompson would be good in the title role because you can usually count on her to be entertaining in form or another, cerebrally, emotionally or comically. What I didn't figure on was the fun, extremely colorful story, overall. This was like a banana split for your senses - all kinds of wild treats for the eyes and ears.....to taste, so to speak.This film features outrageous color schemes from the word ""go,"" from the interior of the ""Brown's"" house, to everyone's apparel to the scenery outside. It almost reminded me ""The Cat In The Hat"" with its crazy colors. All the characters are as exaggerated as the colors, too. The kids may be brats but they aren't bad once they get some needed discipline and love from Nanny McPhee. They are still fun to watch, and all are quite different in appearance and mannerisms. Thompson is a howl as Mary Poppins-like McPhee and so are the supporting characters. There were no sappy songs, either. This is not a musical.The only character annoying to me was the kids' dad, played by Colin Firth. The actor was fine but his character was so wishy-washy, so wussy, he was barely tolerable for much of the film. By the way, you might not recognize the famous Angela Lansbury in here. Everyone, including her, must have had a great time filming this movie. Only the final wedding segment got carried away with juvenile silliness; the rest was fun for adults and well as the kids, who must have loved this all the way through.This is simply good entertainment and highly recommended.",Nanny McPhee
5,BA_Harrison,Nanny McFeeble.,2,3 February 2008,"I bought this movie on DVD because my 6-year-old daughter was having a friend round for a sleepover and I thought it would keep them quiet for an hour or so before bedtime. However, when I showed our young guest my viewing choice for the evening, it was met with extreme indignation. For a peaceful life, I let them watch The Iron Giant instead (a superb film, by the way).The next night, not willing to take the opinion of a little girl as gospel, I sat down with my family to enjoy Nanny McPhee. My wife fell asleep, I almost dozed off, and my daughter fidgeted throughout. Yes, her friend had been right on the money: the film was utter garbage.Nanny McPhee attempts the impossible by challenging Mary Poppins for the title of 'top magical movie nanny'. It tries extremely hard to be more enchanting, funnier, and more romantic than the Disney classic, but fails dismally on all counts (and considering Mary Poppins is far from my favourite kids film, that's saying something!).In this charmless, contrived and incredibly predictable piece of fantasy tosh, Colin Firth plays Mr. Brown, the widowed father of seven unruly children who have scared off seventeen nannies in a row with their dreadful behaviour. Poor ineffectual Mr. Brown, unable to discipline his kids, desperately needs someone capable of controlling his brood. And to make matters worse, unless Mr. Brown remarries within a month, he will lose the financial support he has been receiving from a rich relative of his deceased wife.How will he ever find a nanny tough enough to handle his obnoxious offspring? And who can he get to be his wife at such short notice? Well, the first question is answered when buck-toothed, mono-browed marvel Nanny McPhee (Emma Thompson) turns up on his doorstep; with her magic stick, she can handle any problem thrown her way, and soon has the kids eating out of the palm of her hand. But that still leaves the problem of where to find a new Mrs. Brown. Perhaps Evangeline (Kelly Macdonald), Mr. Brown's beautiful, young, charming, and devoted scullery maid (who gets on with his kids like a house on fire), might know someone suitable...Whilst I might not be Mary Poppins' biggest fan, at least that film had the delightfully yummy Julie Andrews to detract from its dodgy morality, a fairly likable couple of kids, and cheeky old 'cockerney' Dick Van Dyke to liven things up occasionally with a bit of energetic hoofin'; McPhee, on the other hand, has the rather plain Thompson (sporting grotesque make-up), some truly awful attempts at humour (a baby saying 'bum', a dancing donkey, and that tired old slapstick routine, the food-fight), and a group of children just begging for a sound thrashing.With its dreadful script (written by Thompson, who should stick to acting) leaving plenty of unanswered questions (where do the children get hold of a tarantula? how did they overpower the tough ex-army cook? why does no-one seem to be disturbed by a dancing donkey?), and culminating in a saccharine sweet ending that'll have you fighting your gag reflex, Nanny McPhee is less 'supercalifragilisticexpialidocious', more 'stinkincrappyfrickinawfulextrabloodyuseless'.",Nanny McPhee
6,edwagreen,Sound of Music Meets Cinderella and Mary Poppins- Wow **1/2,6,30 September 2006,"A bewitching tale of a widower with seven unruly children. Does this sound familiar? He can't even keep a governess. No, Julie Andrews doesn't enter into the picture.A magical lady (Emma Thompson, who also wrote the screenplay) enters. No, it's not Julie again as ""Mary Poppins.""Aunt Adelaide, a memorable Angela Lansbury, has been supporting the brood. She now says that the money will stop if daddy,an engaging Colin Firth, doesn't remarry.When a horrible woman becomes the prospect, the children conspire with Nanny to get rid of her. A Cinderella like ending ensues.This is a g-rated film. Nice to see Imelda Staunton, who played that abortion lady several years ago, in a totally funny role as the cook of the household.Children will enjoy it. You may add an additional 1/2* if you're young at heart.",Nanny McPhee
7,hitchcockthelegend,Emma Thompson brings magic for all the family.,7,15 April 2010,"17 governesses have tried to run widower Mr. Brown's house, all have fled after being terrorised by his out of control children. Enter the mysterious and unsightly Nanny McPhee, whose magical timing could not be more apt.Emma Thompson adapts from a series of books written by Christianna Brand known as the Nurse Matilda stories. Directed by Kirk Jones (Waking Ned), Nanny McPhee is a delightfully funny family adventure that should hopefully cheer the bluest of hearts. With a very old fashioned ethic at its heart, the film loads in some modern day tricks and eye pleaser's and washes it in vibrant colours. Set in some unnamed place, the film is like a fusion of Alice In Wonderland and Mary Poppins with a slice of Love Actually thrown in for the adults.Thompson takes the lead role and has a blast with it, it seems that McPhee is a role she has waited a long time for. Attacking it with gusto yet constantly having a cheeky glint in her eye, Thompson is just perfect and it comes as no surprise to learn that the sequel is imminent. The rest of the cast keep it fun, Colin Firth as Mr. Brown is playing it as Colin Firth does, elegant yet borderline soft, and Imelda Staunton is revelling in playing the almost nut case Brown family cook. Then there is Celia Imrie's horrid Mrs Quickly, big hair, big smile and big bosom, her scenes in the last quarter are quality comedy, while the beautiful Kelly Macdonald impacts with what is the crucial, yet small, role. The kids are not sickly or annoying, led by Love Actually's Thomas Sangster, director Jones deserves much credit for bringing them all together to engage and entertain without pointless histrionics.But this is Thompson's show, a memorable turn in what is clearly a source subject close to her heart. 7/10",Nanny McPhee
8,Doylenf,"The talented Emma Thompson plays an ""uglified"" Mary Poppins...",7,24 December 2010,"NANNY McPHEE is not a perfect film for children or adults, but it does pass the time pleasantly with some gorgeous color photography that has to be seen to be believed. The cinematography is top notch, the Patric Doyle score is full of deft touches, and the cast is impeccable.But the script seems like a rather patchwork sort of thing, uneven but overall has enough interest to keep anyone entertained with this story of a nanny who assigns herself to take care of a widower's seven unruly children in Victorian England. However, it's not up to the standards that Miss Thomposon imposed on her script for SENSE AND SENSIBILITY.Emma Thompson has been uglified with warts and a protruding tooth to make sure we don't regard her as another sugar-coated version of Mary Poppins. It's a role she apparently feels comfortable in despite what her fans may think. But she's written a wonderful role for COLIN FIRTH as the father who has absolutely no control over some noisy children, yet manages to keep a cheerful disposition on the surface. He proves adept at playing impish humor and runs away with most of the acting honors.Angela Lansbury too has been harshly made up sporting an over-sized crooked nose to play the strict Aunt Adelaide and she is strident, foolish and hilarious in the part, obviously not giving a fig what her fans might think of her appearance. Her scenes with Firth are among the most humorous in the film. Derek Jacobi, Imelda Staunton and Kelly Macdonald stand out in vivid supporting roles.The children are believably rowdy, especially the boy Simon played by Thomas Brodie-Sangster, a mischievous combination of good and evil.Technically, the film is a marvel to look at--gorgeous outdoor settings and overstuffed interiors in stunning color, and well paced by director Kirk Jones.",Nanny McPhee
9,dbborroughs,Wonderful movie about a Nanny who helps put a family right,9,1 January 2006,"If you don't know where this movie is going at the outset, shame on you. Then again it makes no difference since this is just a great movie that makes you smile from ear to ear and then some.Set at the end of the 19th century the plot has a Cedrick Brown (played by Colin Firth) trying desperately to keep his children safe and a roof over their heads. Brown has hired as 17 nannies (all driven away by his children) since his wife died. He needs the nanny to help care and manage his brood while he tries to make a living and to find someone to get married to so his Aunt (played by a frightening Angela Lansbury) won't cut off the support payments. When no more nannies are to be found Brown listens to a mysterious voice that tells him to hire Nanny McPhee. She arrives just as the children begin a bad bout of bad behavior. McPhee (played deliciously by screenwriter Emma Thompson) looks horrific, with misshapen teeth, a uni-brow and numerous warts. She immediately sets to work teaching the children proper behavior, saying she stays when she is needed but not wanted and will only leave when she is wanted but not needed. To say that her methods are unconventional is putting it mildly.I love this movie. I stumbled upon it by accident and found that I was caught up in the movie in more ways than most Hollywood blockbusters have never managed to do. Whats great about this is that we have a bunch of great characters who all behave believably. The kids are real kids who are acting out because they miss there mom and because they've read one too many stories about bad step parents and nannies. They are not mean or vicious, as the housekeeper says repeatedly, they really are good kids. Compare their behavior and motivation to say the little monsters in ""Are we There Yet?' who behave not only badly but evilly in order to keep anyone away from their mom, and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised at how unreal Hollywood portrays kids these days.This is a movie to treasure and keep and share with your kids and everyone else in your family. Its a nice sweet warm movie, thats oh so much better than you think its going to be. Sure it has some similarities to Mary Poppins and you can pretty much guess where its going, but who cares? Its such a great ride getting there.A joy.",Nanny McPhee
10,ferguson-6,"I Want You, I Need You",7,29 January 2006,"Greetings again from the darkness. This is a very enjoyable story for all ages. Director Kirk Jones (the marvelous ""Waking Ned Devine"") presents the Emma Thompson adapted screenplay of the ""Nurse Matilda"" books in an almost live-action cartoon manner. The colors and visuals are delightful without being overwhelming. There are many light moments and nothing that will truly frighten even the youngest kids.Colin Firth (best known for his romantic comedies) is a widower father of so many kids I couldn't keep track. The evil aunt (played in perfect Cruella Deville mode by Angela Lansbury) has threatened to cut off the allowance if Firth does not re-marry. Of course, the track record of his kids (17 nannies run off) does not bode well for Firth and the splitting of the family seems imminent. Enter Nanny McFee.Emma Thompson is marvelous as Nanny McFee and brings her ""charm"" to the task of teaching the children 5 lessons, while claiming no responsibility for anything else they might learn along the way. The kids are all fabulous and the best scenes involve the new Nanny and the mischievous kids. This would not be a real fairy tale without a true love ... Evangeline is played by Kate Winslet look-alike Kelly MacDonald (""Gosford Park"" ""Finding Neverland""). It is also a bit of a shock to see Oscar nominated (""Vera Drake"") actress Imelda Staunton as the stressed out, highly made-up, over-protective cook, Mrs. Blatherwicke.No great mystery to the story, but it is told and filmed in a very accessible, enjoyable manner. Perfect movie for families although the youngest may struggle a bit with the dialogue.",Nanny McPhee
11,anaconda-40658,Mary Poppins is Superior.,3,19 December 2015,"Nanny McPhee (2005): Dir: Kirk Jones / Cast: Emma Thompson, Colin Firth, Angela Launsbury, Kelly MacDonald, Imelda Stauton: Revolting family film that plays like an ugly version of Mary Poppins. It addresses authority while never explaining anything. After the umpteenth nanny leaves a widowed father is met with a mysterious nanny who will whip his misbehaving children into shape. Like Poppins, this nanny isn't given any background but at least Mary Poppins had an engaging personality. McPhee has two warts and a buck tooth that seemingly disappear as the children progress, and she seems to appear at will without explanation. Directed by Kirk Jones with fine visual elements, but the screenplay contains none of the magic or imaginative writing of Mary Poppins. Emma Thompson is a fine talent but McPhee is perhaps too much of a mystery. Colin Firth plays the typical absent father who will learn to have time for the children. He also seems to be stupid enough to marry the first woman who glances his way. Angela Launsbury plays an evil relative with greedy intentions. She dealt with similar material in the magical Bedknobs and Broomsticks where she played a witch in charge of three children. Kelly MacDonald plays a maid who will obviously end up with Firth. Perhaps if he used birth control he wouldn't overpopulate. Score: 3 / 10",Nanny McPhee
12,gradyharp,'I did knock': A Delightfully Served Bit of Pastiche with Meat under the Frosting,8,24 June 2006,"Because of its silly packaging and dependency on graphics that appear to dumb down the prospective audience, NANNY McPHEE may not gain the position on the lineup of really good movies before the public right now. But for those who can ignore the packaging, inside is a DVD that is a smart, cleverly written with style and grace by star Emma Thompson (based on the novels Nurse Matilda), directed with aplomb by Kirk Jones, and with a cast of irresistible, irascible children and adults, magical movie that is way over the top in color and slapstick in some places but remains a fluffy delight! The story is simple on the surface: Colin Firth plays Mr. Brown a recently widowed father of seven children whose business (a funeral director) keeps him away from home, resulting in a clan of kids who are as boisterously misbehaved as any children ever encountered. All nannies hired run away in terror at encountering the children: their only constants are the scullery maid Evangeline (Kelly Macdonald) and the cook Mrs. Blatherwick (Imelda Staunton). Brown is under the thumb of Aunt Adelaide (Angela Lansbury) who threatens to cut off her necessary financial support unless Brown remarries immediately. In a wonderfully otherworldly manner the name of Nanny McPhee resounds and the grossly unattractive, warty, obese and bucktoothed (only one!) strange nanny appears to assist. She speaks softly and carries a big walking stick, an implement that can bring magical changes when tapped on the floor. She sates she will stay despite the fact the children need her but don't want her and will leave when the children want her but don't need her. The manner in which this gentle and odd nanny affects the changes she demands (going to bed on time, getting up on time, saying please and thank you, etc) works wonders - not only for the children but also for Brown's response to the demands of the aunt.Emma Thompson is wonderful as the ugly but gradually beautified nanny, Colin Firth shines as the father, and the supporting cast of seven superb child actors (Thomas Sangster, Eliza Bennett, Jennifer Rae Daykin, Raphael Coleman, Sam Honywood, Holly Gibbs, and the infant sisters Barnes), Imelda Stanuton ('Vera Drake') , Celia Imrie ('Calendar Girls'), Angela Lansbury, and even Derek Jacobi and Patrick Barlow in small supporting roles make this fairy tale entertaining and instructive! 'Tis a pity the movie sinks to recreation of the old and very tired food fight sequence at the wedding, but after all this is mainly a film for children and as such guarantees belly laughs. It is a lot of fun and has some important lessons for children AND adults, and it makes for a light but delightful evening of sharing. Grady Harp, June 06",Nanny McPhee
13,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Nanny McPhee,6,10 March 2006,"Nanny McPhee, based on the Nurse Matilda books, tells the story of the Brown family. Mr Brown (Colin Firth) is a widower who has to single handedly bring up seven children. Make that seven mischievous children who has driven away a record 17 nannies. He needs to work to bring home the bacon, but cannot find a suitable nanny who could stand the children's antics. Until Nanny McPhee (Emma Thompson) turns up mysteriously one day (yes, she did knock), and weaves her brand of wit and magic into the Browns.It's a simple fairy tale like story meant for kids, with lessons like listening to the adults, behaving, and love. Adding a tad complexity to the plot would be Mr Brown's desperate search for a wife to remarry, so that the family could continue to receive monetary support from their Aunt Adelaide (Angela Lansbury, Murder She Wrote, anyone?) But the storyline gets predictable halfway into the movie, and unless you're a ten year old, you'll probably figure out the plot from then on.Along similar production styles like recent children-focused tales such as A Series of Unfortunate Events, the production sets are a sight to behold, especially during parts where the CGI, though simple, actually managed to add a touch of grandeur to entire scenes. While Nanny McPhee is the title role, we don't get much of the backstory of this magical nanny, so you'll have to take it at face value on what she's capable of, or read the books.If children's acting (or lack thereof) get on your nerves, you'll be surprised at the tots' performances, even the littlest one. I thought Thomas Sangster, who plays the eldest son Simon, looked a bit like Freddie Highmore. Possible challenger there. The pacing of the movie is kept even, with comedic situations thrown in aplenty to probably make you forget about the average storyline.So if you're in for a movie which is kept really simple, and suitable for a family with small children, then look no further, Nanny McPhee will be the movie of your choice this week.",Nanny McPhee
14,siderite,"How British. Not very good, though.",7,16 February 2006,"Imagine a cross breed between Harry Potter and Mary Poppins. The nanny from hell comes to take care of some horrible brats that can't be controlled by their almost absent father. She uses magic and cunning to make them like her and obey. In the end, everything is OK and everybody is happy.""How British"", I thought while watching this film. I could have imagined a similar movie with soldiers being abused by their officers in the army while trying to maintain their individuality and losing and then agreeing that it's for the best. In this particular movie, the nanny is well intentioned, but she could have been just as well a child eating witch.No matter how you try to look at it, the father is a weakling, making too many children when he has no way of supporting them, then having to stand the abhorring attitude of his rich aunt just for the money, while being more interested in his newspaper than in his children. The children are clever and mischievous and I am sure that in the book you get to like them, but in the film they just shift from hellbent to little angels in a matter of minutes. The beautiful maid that has an inferiority complex because she is undereducated manages to get over her complex by... education. The aunt is just plain silly and played by an actress that no one ever liked. The cook is just a walking cliché, just like the evil step mother.In the end you just feel that you have been force fed lessons of morality that you either didn't want or you already knew. And Emma Thompson, such a great actress, is lost in this movie. She plays beautifully, but, alas, this isn't a great movie.",Nanny McPhee
15,JamesHitchcock,Mary Poppins Updated,7,26 May 2011,"""Nanny McPhee"" is essentially ""Mary Poppins"" updated for the twenty-first century, although it also incorporates elements from ""The Sound of Music"". Like ""The Sound of Music"" it revolves around a widower with seven children. It shares with ""Mary Poppins"" a late Victorian or Edwardian setting and the idea of a mysterious nanny with magical powers. There are, however, also differences between ""Nanny McPhee"" and those two films. Whereas Captain von Trapp was a strict disciplinarian, the father in this film, the undertaker Cedric Brown, is completely unable to discipline his unruly children, who take great pride in the fact that they have managed to drive out seventeen nannies. Whereas Mary Poppins was played by Julie Andrews as an attractive young woman in her twenties, Nanny McPhee is (at least at first) a hideous old crone with a snaggle tooth and a face covered in warts. After she arrives at Cedric's home, he in desperation hires her as his children's eighteenth nanny, and she sets about reforming them through a mixture of magic and strict discipline. There are also sub-plots involving Cedric's elderly and eccentric Aunt Adelaide, on whom the family are financially dependent, and Mrs. Selma Quickly, a vulgar and self-centred widow with romantic designs on Cedric. It is thanks to Nanny McPhee's help that the children succeed in securing the continuance of Aunt Adelaide's allowance and thwarting Mrs Quickly's plans, as well as engineering a romance between their father and the pretty young scullery maid Evangeline. As the children's behaviour improves, so do Nanny's looks, until by the end of the film she is free of her disfigurements. Emma Thompson not only stars in the film, but also wrote the screenplay, as she did for another of her films, ""Sense and Sensibility"". Thompson seems to have been angling for both the child and the adult audiences. Parents will be delighted that Nanny McPhee has five important lessons to teach her charges, all along the lines of go to bed when you are told, do as you are told and respect your elders and betters. Yet despite this improving, moralistic framework, the younger generation will be equally delighted by the fact that the Brown children manage to get away with a surprising amount of anarchistic mischief (including a food fight) and to terrorise the unpleasant adults, especially Mrs Quickly. ""Nanny McPhee"" is the sort of film that the phrase ""fun for all the family"" could have been invented for. 7/10",Nanny McPhee
16,Smells_Like_Cheese,Nanny McPhee is Mary Popping's older and less attractive sister :-D,9,30 September 2006,"No, I'm just kidding. I really don't watch children's movies, only when I babysit, and my cousins picked this one out for our movie night, actually it turned into a very pleasant surprise. Nanny McPhee is a very charming and lovely new ""Mary Poppins"" for our young generation. Even as an adult, I have to say that I enjoyed it as well. It had fun acting, bright colors, and magical enchantment that can grab anyone.Colin Firth plays Mr. Brown, a single widowed father who must marry a woman by the end of the month, otherwise his aunt will cut off his allowance and he'll loose his children. However his children not knowing of this information scare off every possible wife and nanny, that is until Nanny McPhee comes along and changes all that. She isn't the most pleasant face to look at, but does what no one else can, she brings discipline and love into the family and helps them bond and find new things that brings them together.It has the happiest ending that makes your tooth hurt, it's so sweet. :D I would highly recommend Nanny McPhee for the whole family to enjoy, it's a great movie.

17,disdressed12,I quite enjoyed it(a good family film),8,21 January 2007,"this is a good movie.it is directed by Kirk Jones,writer and director of ""Waking Ned Devine""it has something for everyone.mild rude humour for the kids, bit of romance for the adults.okay maybe teens won't like it.It is a fantasy movie,so it obviously much of it is not realistic of course.it echoes 1964's sound of music,but is more complex and has more depth.Ther are some dark moments which may be a little frightening for really young children,so use your discretion.the film is very colourful and well photographed.The acting is very good,although this not a film where the actors had to dig deep to find their characters.Anyway,Mr.Brown(Colin Firth-""Bridget Jonse's Diary 1 and 2"",""Love Actually"")has a problem.he is a single father with 7 uncontrollable children.They have managed to drive away every Nanny he has hired,usually in days or less.the local Nanny agency will no longer supply him with a nanny telling him at one point something along the lines of""they're all gone"",you've driven them all away"".So,one day,in walks the mysterious Nanny Mcphee(Emma Thompson,Love actually, ""Stranger Than Fiction"", also wrote the screenplay based on the children's novels""Nurse Matilda,by Christianna Brand).but she is no ordinary Nanny,as is quickly revealed.what follows is chaos,comedy romance until what should by now be the obvious ending.the beautiful and very talented Kelly Macdonald(""Finding Neverland"",""The Girl in the Cafe"" plays the love interest.Angela Lansbury also appears in the movie as does Imelda Staunton.overall,a fun family film.",Nanny McPhee
18,Buddy-51,Where is Julie Andrews when you really need her?,4,6 July 2006,"Except for the fact that the characters don't break out into song at regular intervals, ""Nanny McPhee"" is a weird hybrid between ""Mary Poppins"" and ""The Sound of Music"" (hereafter to be referred to as MP and TSOM), with an uglied-up Emma Thompson replacing the anything-but-ugly Julie Andrews in the lead role.Miss McPhee is a British nanny with magical powers who arrives unannounced at the doorstep of one Mr. Brown (MP), a widower with seven unruly children (TSOM) who, due to business and financial pressures (MP) and grief over his wife's death (TSOM), has been rather neglectful of his progeny of late (both MP and TSOM). The children have successfully driven away all the town's employable nannies with their precocity and unruly behavior (MP and TSOM), but could they have finally met their match in the mysterious Nanny McPhee? There's also a subplot about Brown bringing home an odious woman to be a new mother to the children and their attempts to sabotage the effort that has ""The Sound of Music"" written all over it. And the final scene is such an unabashed and shameless rip-off of the closing moments (albeit sans umbrellas and kites) of ""Mary Poppins"" that I can't believe there aren't grounds for a copyright-infringement lawsuit here.Since ""Nanny McPhee"" has stolen virtually every one of its plot points from those two previously mentioned classics, it's hard not to weigh this film against the originals and to find ""Nanny McPhee"" wanting in every respect. This is a drab, cheerless film filled with overdrawn caricatures and unappealing visuals. Nanny McPhee, replete with uni-brow, hairy warts and a prominent buck tooth, is herself so physically repulsive that she is liable to give impressionable youngsters nightmares for months afterwards. And buried under all that restrictive and distracting makeup, Emma Thompson can't even begin to deliver anything like a full-bodied, well-rounded performance. Of course, since she herself wrote the screenplay (based on the books by Christianna Brand), she probably has no one to blame but herself for her predicament. Pity, instead, poor Colin Firth and Angela Lansbury, fine performers who seem to be marking time waiting for some better roles to come along.My big question when it comes to ""Nanny McPhee"" is why settle for this cheap knock-off when the originals are readily available and so much better?",Nanny McPhee
19,MOscarbradley,"The dark side of ""Mary Poppins""",8,1 January 2008,"A terrific children's film, a kind of Gothic ""Mary Poppins"" whose dark, comic sensibility will appeal equally to adults as well as children and after which I think I'll forgive Colin Firth virtually anything. Emma Thompson is the eponymous nanny who uses her magic, (darker than we are used to in kid's movies), to solve Firth's problems in raising his brood of motherless children. She's a wonder, of course, in every sense; a performance good enough to make you wish she were given better dramatic parts than she's been getting recently while Thomas Sangster is marvellous as Simon but then in this film all the children are first-rate.",Nanny McPhee
20,MLDinTN,a modern Mary Poppins,8,6 January 2007,"This was an excellent kid film that can be enjoyed by adults also. It's like Mary Poppins in that a nanny comes to help out a family and make them closer. The few special effects worked perfectly because they were not over-the-top. The movie was amusing and entertaining. It's about a nanny who uses magic to settle down some unruly children while helping them bond with their father. The father must also marry to please the aunt in order to continue to receive monetary support. They have a young, attractive maid. I wonder where she could fit into all this. Then there is a funny red head cook and a possible evil step-mother. Angela Lansbury plays the near-sighted Aunt perfectly. Emma Thompson also shows her acting skills.FINAL VERDICT: Good, kids will like it as well as adults.",Nanny McPhee
21,g-bodyl,A Delightful Fairy-Tale!,9,6 February 2014,"I never thought much about seeing this film, but I finally got a chance to the other night and I'm glad I did. While turned off by the previews at first, only after I watched this film did I realize what a very good film it is, both for adults and children. There are some silly moments here, but as British comedy/fantasy, this film turns out to be much more fun and clever. I would even go as far to say that this movie is magical and I say that thanks to a very strong ending.Kirk Jone's film is about a recently-widowed father who has misbehaved children and they chase out any nanny who has been there. Answering his plea for help, a Nanny McPhee decides to offer her services and with her five rules, the children will learn not to get on her wrong side.The acting is pretty good in this film as one would expect with Emma Thompson and Colin Firth as headliners. Emma Thompson does a really good job as Nanny McPhee and she goes through a complete transformation over the course of the film. Meanwhile, Colin Firth uses his charming British personality to deliver another solid performance. Also, I'm certainly glad the kids are not annoying in this film, unlike most American films.Overall, Nanny McPhee turns out to be a magical film that is good for both children and adults. There are a few lessons that are worth learning that are scattered throughout the film, and I think that enhances the movie. This is a fun, entertaining film and it does not try to be more. I rate this film 9/10.",Nanny McPhee

Mother Brown has died, one must understand, and Mr. Brown is a well-meaning but bumbling father and funeral home director. Unless he marries again soon, as well, his Aunt Adelaide-in-law will not give him enough money to exist. Without the loot, he and the family are sunk. Enter Nanny McPhee! She uses her magical powers (tapping her cane) to tame the children but can she help save the family from disaster, too? This wonderful film is a fine cousin to the classic Mary Poppins. Thompson brings great humanity and humor to her role as a major force in guiding/pushing families in the right direction in life. Firth, also, is a dear as the hapless but bighearted father. Sprinkle in a handful of boisterous children, a dream of a supporting cast, and some very beautiful sets and scenery and presto! We have a winning movie, indeed.

24,tabuno,Mary Poppins Updated,7,22 January 2019,"29 May 2006. Nanny McPhee is a fun, entertaining family movie incorporating a good dose of magic and period piece of a widowed father having to contend with a difficult brood of seven children. But Emma Thompson appears to have little problem with her subtle acting in quickly transforming this dysfunctional family into a funny, sometimes sensitive family feature film. Combining some of the old traditional movies with the formally required pastry scene along with more unique use of self-empowering Nanny actions that allow the children much more initiative than most movies of its type, this family movie stands out as a delight for its contemporary message and its restraint. Yet the use of magic, unfortunately seemed a bit over-used in comparison to Mary Poppins, making this movie more distanced, more unbelievable, more of a fairy tale than relevant to the real world. Overall, Nanny McPhee is one of those movies that can be watched numerous times with glee. Seven out of Ten Stars.",Nanny McPhee
25,filipemanuelneto,A great movie for the whole family,8,14 January 2020,"In this fantasy movie we find a widower on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Lonely since his wife's death, he has to divide his time between running his funeral home and raising his many children. To make matters worse, the kids are real brats who scare away all the mistresses their father arranges to look after them. But everything changes when a special nurse comes to that house.It is a film clearly aimed at young audiences, but it will certainly be well tolerated by adults. Colorful, cheerful and very fun, has a good story where it conveys good educational values such as respect, friendship, family value. Of course everything is a bit predictable, but even so the movie proves to be catchy. Despite the strength of the kids, who are reserved for the hilarious moments of the movie, the movie is expertly directed by two or three very experienced adult actors who quietly steer it all: I'm talking, of course, about Colin Firth and Emma Thompson, but especially this actress who, in addition to giving life to the lead role, also ensures the writing of the script. She, better than anyone, understood well what the film needed and knew to be up to it. In addition, the film also features the brilliant participation of veteran Angela Lansbury and the sweetness of Kelly Macdonald.Technically, the film bets heavily on CGI and quality visual and sound effects. A bet that surprises us nothing but does not detract from the final product. Good costumes and scenery help, although I had trouble digesting such an overt abuse of the almost ubiquitous green, yellow, and pink colors. This made the movie visually tiring. Patrick Doyle has signed the soundtrack, which looks beautiful in the film, though not exactly in the ear.",Nanny McPhee

I've seen all the other movies dealing with the single parent, and every sitter they hire, the kids fire. They were running wild after their mum died, so there's one nanny they can't seem to get rid of, The hideous Nanny McPhee(Emma Thompson). Despite her appearance, her heart was in the right place, and all the kids got an a complete attitude adjustment. The most they respect her, the prettier she gets. What's worse than her is a woman named Evageline(Kelly MacDonald) who want to marry the father(Colin Firth), but the kids don't like her at all. They would rather keep McPhee, than deal with the gold-digger. They ended up being the heroes, and Nanny McPhee's appearance changed from hideous to beautiful. She lives by this rule: ""If you don't want me around, I stay, and when you want me to stay, I go."" Sounds odd though, but anyone could understand it someway. I think it's a perfect family movie.

32,dwpollar,"Funny, heartwarming family comedy...",7,7 May 2006,"1st watched 5/6/2006 - 7 out of 10(Dir-Kirk Jones): Funny, heartwarming family comedy with a great performance by Emma Thompson and awesome makeup to make this natural beauty look extremely ugly with warts and all. The story is about a father, who's wife dies and leaves him with seven kids that he can't handle on his own, and is in search for a nanny that the kids won't run off. The problem is that they've successfully done this 17 times in a row!! They really don't want a nanny and would rather have their mother back, or at least someone else to replace her and more attention from their busy, heartbroken father. He still talks to his wife next to the fireplace into her empty chair as if she still is there for him. But of course, she's not returning; but instead steps in magical Nanny McPhee as the 18th applicant, supposedly working for the government. She is a basically a witch. She looks like one, has the powers of one, but has the heart of an angel and sees straight into the hearts of the family and their needs. Early in the movie, some of the kids pranks are rather gruesome which gives the movie a slow start. One particularly eye-opening stint where they pretend to have cooked and eaten their youngest runs off an applicant very quickly. But after this, the movie does a great job of helping you see why the kids are reacting the way that they are, which is a big step above most movies of this type. Thompson actually wrote the screenplay to the film and is also the executive producer as well, I believe. She put a lot of herself into this movie but it has sadly not gotten the recognition it deserves. The set has a Harry-Potter-like feel to it, being British and dark but ends in a very light-hearted note which it very well should have. There isn't much else I can say about this movie except buy the DVD!! It's great entertainment with an awesome family-oriented message with a great ending!!",Nanny McPhee
33,noralee,A Nanny with Warts and Twinkling Eyes Captivates a Charming Household,8,15 March 2006,"Until the cute animated closing credits referenced the ""Nurse Matilda"" books by Christianna Brand as the source of star's Emma Thompson screenplay, I thought ""Nanny McPhee"" was a charming new take on a ""Mary Poppins"" for a new generation.Unlike P.L. Travers' creation, this Nanny 911 is much more about the children themselves learning to use their wits and initiative for more than making mischief. While the girl children are uniformly bland, the boys are quite captivating with their actions and bright dialog, particularly Thomas Sangster who was also quite good in ""Tristan & Isolde"" (though the baby should be a toddler not an infant in terms of the time line of the mother's death and the family's grief recovery). Colin Firth is endearing as the beleaguered widower, even if his job as an undertaker is Roald Dahl-like macabre for a kids' movie. Too bad Derek Jacobi and Patrick Barlow play his assistants like broad imitations of Quentin Crisp. Angela Lansbury has her best role in years as the snobby aunt. That Imelda Staunton's cook was ex-Army added considerably to her character. The education of Kelly Macdonald's maid was sweet side story character development. Celia Imrie plays up the sex-starved bit too much for a kids' movie, though. I was actually disappointed that the Nanny started to look more and more like the real beautiful Thompson as the children learned to behave.The production design is cotton colored candy delightful, even as it gets more and more fanciful. The wedding scene is uproarious, with broad food fight humor that children will love. The vaguely Victorian setting added to the fairy tale feel, and there are several amusing references to nursery rhymes and fairy tales, particularly about wicked step-mothers.There are a few big vocabulary words in the dialog that young children won't understand but they also won't need to follow along.Patrick Doyle's score is a bit overpowering at times but is still appropriately light-hearted.",Nanny McPhee
34,adamjohns-42575,I did knock!,4,5 September 2021,"It was always going to be said that there are a lot of similarities to 'Mary Poppins', however, based on the trailers, I had expected McPhee to be slightly harsher than she was to help bring about the children's realisation that they need to behave and in some instances grow up slightly.I'm not sure that it isn't a bit dated too, because of its setting and situation, most people today not having a nanny, cook and scullery maid for example. There were also references to things like ""libations"" which were probably lost on some adults as much as the children it's aimed at. I personally expected things to be a bit more magical and jolly in a similar way to Mary Poppins, but was disappointed to find that a lot of the pranks are quite silly and might only appeal to a very young audience who may not understand the rest of the story or the moral about behavingI did like the magic that did happen, especially the ending and it was a simple and harmless film. I know that it's not aimed at me as a target audience, but I can only judge it based on my 40 years and how I think I would have reacted to it when I was younger and how my niece and nephews may have greeted it.In their case, I can only imagine one out of the three sitting still long enough to watch all of it. And for me, I think my ten year old self would have cried plageuarism (Or copycats) and demanded to watch Mary instead as the superior telling of a magical nanny story.You can't deny the actors abilities, but as it is made for the kids, the characters are a bit pantomime.I suppose I just expected more.408.85/1000.",Nanny McPhee

However, the scenes with greedy ""Mrs. Quickly"" decidedly give the film a PG rating in an otherwise benign and thoroughly enjoyable children's film. She dresses cheaply and she ""pops out"" of her tight-fitting blouse. The story is sort of a ""Mary Poppins clone"" but with many different twists, and it's not a musical. Nanny McPhee starts out ugly with warts, a snaggle-tooth and huge ears, As the 7 naughty children she teaches to behave get nicer, the nanny becomes much better looking.

37,valadas,It improves as it progresses,6,6 April 2012,This movies starts and develops at first almost like an awkward and pale remake of THE SOUND OF MUSIC (minus the music and plus the magic an a few more farcical than funny gags). After a mediocre and not very original development with a few not very funny gags the last scenes save the movie from a negative mark. In fact we begin to see a few funnier gags (namely the cream tart battle scenes at the wedding ceremony) and some scenes of poetical and romantic meaning. Emma Thompson makes a more or less good character as the Nanny and her surprising transformation along the movie till the final outcome is very meaningful even in the general context of the story.

Actually, I watched the entire film with the sound off, which probably improved things greatly. What I saw was a reasonably charming kids' film, aimed at a very young audience, about a witch who comes to live with a mother-less family and works her magic to bring about happy endings for all involved. Colin Firth is the hapless widower who must find a new wife or lose his home (see the film). Emma Thompson is the all-knowing, all-wise Nanny McPhee, and I could have written the finale, which has her losing her hideous witch's face so that we can see how lovely she is in real life. Also predictably, at the finale, Nanny walks off into the sunset, a la Mary Poppins, to assist other families in need. The kids are a riot, and the buck-toothed woman playing Firth's neighbor and forthcoming bride is an absolute hoot. Nevertheless, I cannot imagine a sequel to this.",Nanny McPhee

41,artzau,Wonderful!,8,28 January 2006,"I love Ema Thompson. Period. But, she has outdone herself here. The wonderfully naughty children of an overindulgent and stressed father, Colin Firth, have put all the nannies in town to flight and Up pops Nanny McPhee, homely as a mud-fence, hairy moles (not warts, as the children accuse) an oversize incisor and bulbous nose. With a dash of magic, she starts to set things in order but, hey, this ain't Julie Andrews in Mary Poppins. There is some wonderful performances here by the delightful character actors, Derek Jacobi, Patrick Barlow and the always delightful Imelda Stauton as the cook, Mrs. Blatherwick. Angela Lansbury is also wonderfully pompous and young Kelly MacDonald makes a wonderful love interest. The children are lively and the pace of the tale gets a little slow at times but never drags.However, most striking is the use of the device of magic, which is used here as an empowering device which allows the children to bring themselves ultimately into line. If one reads the original Mary Poppins, one sees she is much more like Nanny McPhee and a lot less like Julie Andrews. The British social class issue is much more pronounced and up front and is certainly not whitewashed as was seen the Disney version of Mary Poppins, which, BTW, horrified the author, P.L. Travers. Nor, for that matter, is the device of magic overworked as in the Rowling books, where precious little is left to the wile of the children protagonists except their ken of magic. This movie works but it will not please some who will want a more action-packed and device-laden story. But, I loved it.",Nanny McPhee

43,bopdog,Marvelous! Exactly the kind of masterpiece you'd expect from Emma Thompson! (and world-treasure Angela Lansbury),10,3 November 2005,"'Nanny McPhee' is a good movie in its own right, not merely as a kid's movie, or an art movie. Emma Thompson keeps on amazing us all with her screen writing (she is an Oscar winner for that, after all!), and her acting (ditto on the awards). Nanny McPhee is weird, to be sure--- but not just weird for weird's sake, such as a Tim Burton movie. Rather, the weirdness seems to take real life issues, and issues relating to parenting, and turn them around artistically into genuine entertainment.The cast is stupendous. Colin Firth, great as always. The very pleasant surprise for me was Angela Lansbury. She must be 111 by now--- she was already a big Hollywood star back in 1941, after all. But here she played a classic old eccentric English character, SORT OF in the Margaret Rutherford vein, but unique, fresh, and amazing in its own right. It took me half an hour to place Lansbury, her character was so spot-on, and so wonderful. Her presence in the movie is a treat, in and of itself.Children's movies have their own criteria for judgement, of course. But sadly, often kid movies are judged favorably if they posses a certain type of 'fairy-tale-ness', even if the movie is otherwise a load of crap. Like the some Tim Burton movies, in my humble opinion, or to some extent, even the recent Willy Wonka effort--- 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'. That movie was 'ok', but was substantially dark and creepy, as is most of Roald Dahl's work. But he smacks of Kid Movie Heaven, so critics and parents seem to praise his stuff irrespective of its true quality. Anyway, that's my view.'Nanny McPhee' is light, airy, and very positive. As well as being a cracker of a movie. I would take my kids to it. I think the message for kids is overall positive, and something parents could be comfortable with exposing their children to.",Nanny McPhee

The rest of the cast are pretty near perfect. The children led by Thomas Brodie- Sangster are just right and manage to be irritating at the beginning without being so obnoxious that the viewer hates them. Imelda Staunton shows what a fine comedy actress she is as does Celia Imrie. Emma Thompson has written a marvellous screenplay and her performance as the title character is just pitch perfect. it would have been so easy to overplay such a quirky character. She is everything that Mary Poppins should have been and was not. This is the sort of film that normally i would run a hundred miles from so I never saw it in the cinema or on DVD. I caught it on TV and both my wife and I loved it. Miss Thompson has crafted an instant children's classic which will be shown over and over and enjoyed by succeeding generations of all ages.",Nanny McPhee
46,iohefy-2,Nice little movie,7,24 January 2006,"Tonight I went to see the preview of Nanny McPhee and although I had some reservations about this kids movie I really enjoyed the movie. The cast of Emma Thompson as Nanny McPhee was excellent in the role, as well as Colin Firth and it was good to see Angela Lansbury back on the big screen. All the children in the movie were very good and added to the story. Despite the theater being full of kids, it was surprisingly quiet throughout the showing. Although this is primarily a children's movie I as an adult enjoyed the well written screen play. If you have some little ones at home and want to really entertain them take them to see this delightful move, they will really appreciate it. It is a delight!",Nanny McPhee
47,DavidSim240183,Scary Poppins,8,16 November 2008,"Nanny McPhee is a film I wouldn't normally touch with a 4-metre barge pole. The plot of a magical nanny sounds like a steal from Mary Poppins (which it is), and pie fights and dancing donkeys didn't exactly build a strong case for the film. Until I learned it was written by and starred Emma Thompson.Emma Thompson is one of my favourite British actresses. What I love about her is the way she is so untouched by celebrity. She never puts on airs. She is so down to earth and is yet possessed of a sharp, sophisticated wit. In everything I see her in, she never fails to steal the show. You could be seated next to her on a plane, carry on a conversation and enjoy it. And she would enjoy talking to you. (As long as it was about something interesting!).It's always a joy to see her in something, but even more of a joy to see something she's written. Emma Thompson's witty, ironic prose works well on the big screen. She won a well deserved Oscar for Sense and Sensibility, a surprisingly funny account of the opposing classes. But one wishes writing is something she would return to more often. Its something she doesn't do nearly enough of. Nanny McPhee is her first proper screenplay since Sense and Sensibility. Adapted from the Nurse Matilda books by Christianna Brand, and playing the title role, its something she's tailored to her specifications.Nanny McPhee comes to oversee the seven unruly Brown children. Their father Mr Brown (Colin Firth) hasn't been able to keep the family together since they're mother died. They've driven away 17 nannies (like another Julie Andrews vehicle I know), and Mr Brown is at his wits end. That changes when Nanny McPhee arrives. With her bulbous nose, overhanging tooth and warts and all, Nanny McPhee is the type of nanny Rosemary might hire for her baby. Her credo is simple:""When you need me but don't want me, that's when I will stay. When you want me, but no longer need me, that's when I must go.""She slowly works her magic over the Brown household. She whips the kids into shape, teaching them lessons about responsibility and common courtesy along the way. She plays matchmaker between Mr Brown and the household's lovely scullery maid, Evangeline (the radiant Kelly Macdonald). But the dastardly Aunt Adelaide (a magnificent Angela Lansbury) has her own plans.Nanny McPhee is not a perfect film. At its most generic level, it is a ripoff of Mary Poppins, (we even get to see the kids flying kites at one point) but a Mary Poppins reworked through Roald Dahl. Nanny McPhee is a film that might have worked better were it released through a British company instead of Universal. This is just a personal opinion, but I feel British films released through American studios tend to lose a lot of their bite. Its a problem that particularly crippled Love Actually.Quite a few actors from Love Actually crop up in Nanny McPhee. Aside from Emma Thompson and Colin Firth, there is the young and immensely talented Thomas Sangster, and Adam Godley in a small role of a vicar. There is a bit of novelty in actors from disparate story lines of Love Actually all sharing the same one this time.Because its released through Universal Studios, it means that there are a lot of special effects in the film. I really hated the dancing donkey. Have I already mentioned that? And some of the sets are so overdesigned they begin to wear on the eyes after a while. But the film's one major asset is the always delightful Emma Thompson.Thompson carries herself with a mystery and arch drollery that keeps you continually involved. Even when the film threatens to get into some sticky areas along the way, Thompson's magical presence is always a hook. Even buried under tons of makeup, her vibrant, bubbly persona shines right through it. One of the film's more unusual touches is the way she sheds some of her ugliness whenever she teaches the kids a new lesson. By the end of the film, she becomes the beauty she's tried to bring out in the people around her.Thompson's clout in the industry has allowed her to share the screen with a really excellent cast. Thankfully, unlike Love Actually, there are no Americans. And none of they're colloquialisms either. Colin Firth is OK, but he doesn't get much to do except feign exasperation. But the rest of the cast is superb. The sweetly appealing Kelly Macdonald is great, two years before her surprisingly convincing performance in the excellent No Country For Old Men. She's a whiz with accents. Going from a working class scullery maid to an upper class, proper lady with utter conviction.We also have Imelda Staunton as the Brown's no-nonsense, military in mind cook Mrs Blatherwick. With her rosy cheeks, chin and forehead, she looks like she's about to die of terminal rosacea. Celia Imrie is hilarious as Mrs Quickly, the strumpet of ample bosoms with an eye on the Brown family fortune. Her facial expressions are as distracting as her cleavage. We also have Derek Jacobi and Patrick Barlow as a couple of prancing dandy's. But its Angela Lansbury who really shines as the perfectly horrid Aunt Adelaide. With her beady eyes, hook nose and clipped elocution, she's the only one in the cast who can keep up with Emma Thompson.Director Kirk Jones sometimes mismanages things, allowing the comedy to topple into slapstick farce. The early scenes with the kids are just noisy. And the wedding climax's cake throwing and imagined bees is just plain silly. The film is at its best when Nanny McPhee is quietly pulling the strings from the shadows.

48,MCMAYNERBERRY,A Castrophe,3,24 April 2008,"Nanny McPhee (Emma Thompson), a person of unsettling appearance and magical powers, enters the household of the recently widowed Mr. Brown (Colin Firth) and attempts to tame his seven exceedingly ill-behaved children. The children, led by the oldest boy Simon (Thomas Sangster), have managed to drive away 17 previous nannies and are certain that they will have no trouble with this one. But as Nanny McPhee takes control, they begin to notice that their vile behavior now leads swiftly and magically to rather startling consequences.Her influence also extends to the family's deeper problems, including Mr. Brown's sudden and seemingly inexplicable attempts to find a new wife; an announcement by the domineering Aunt Adelaide (Angela Lansbury) that she intends to take one of the children away; and the sad and secret longings of their scullery maid, Evangeline (Kelly Macdonald). As the children's behavior begins to change, Nanny McPhee's arresting face and frame appear to change as well, creating even more questions about this mysterious stranger whom the children and their father have come to love.

49,TheHonestCritic,"A rip-off of ""Mary Poppins"" (1964)? Or, is this it's own unique and creative film? Check out my review below!",4,24 October 2021,"""Nanny McPhee"" (2005), yep, this is another ""movie"" I was forced to watch with my relatives. Even before I saw it, I had a feeling it would be nothing but a shameless knockoff of ""Mary Poppins"" (1964). Sure enough, I was right. This ""film"" is a pointless imitation of ""Mary Poppins"" with a slightly different context. ""Nanny McPhee"" has a predictable and cliched storyline, average to horrible acting, and a generic soundtrack to try and tie it all together. The plot is, a governess named Nanny McPhee comes to a house to discipline seven children, using her magical powers. Aside from being a ""Mary Poppins"" ripoff, it's also ripping off ""The Sound of Music"" (1965)! As you recall, ""The Sound of Music"" involves seven children and a governess. So effectively, it's ripping off two classic movies! What a sham! That being said, all films and TV shows are recycled storylines. But, the key is to try and improve on the concept and try to give it a unique premise. ""Nanny McPhee"" does none of that whatsoever. When I watched it in the movie theater with my family, I just sat there and thought to myself: ""why aren't I watching 'Mary Poppins'? Why did I agree to see it with them?"" Another recycled plot point ""Nanny McPhee"" has, is the scenario where the father has trouble raising his family. Gee, I wonder where I saw that before? Oh yeah, in ""Mary Poppins""! At any point where it ripped off that film, I rolled my eyes and thought to myself: ""come on! Seriously?!"" The plot for this ""movie"" is not creative, it's not original there is next to no charm and it's not the least bit entertaining. Even Nanny McPhee's motto is similar to Mary Poppins'! She says: ""when you need me, but do not want me, then I must stay. When you want me, but no longer need me, then I have to go."" ""Mary Poppins"" follows that exact same method! Right when the family is starting to improve, she leaves. It's like they took the script for ""Mary Poppins"" and altered it slightly. When the end credits finally rolled, it was a sight for sore eyes. I couldn't wait to get out of that theater! As for the acting, it's just as horrible as the storyline. Everyone in the cast does a terrible job with their performances! The sad thing is, a lot of the actors and actresses are talented. For example, Emma Thompson and Colin Firth are great actors! What happened to them here? I thought for sure they'd do the best they could with their performances. Unfortunately, not even they could save this ""film""! As far as the soundtrack by Patrick Doyle goes, it's about as generic as you can possibly get. I was very surprised by that, because he has written some great film scores for other movies. What happened to him here? It's almost like someone else wrote the film score and put his name on it! Now, let's get to the only two good elements in this piece of garbage. The only good things are the sets/locations and the special effects. All of the sets/locations are great and give this ""film"" a decent atmosphere. As far as the special effects go, they are well-done and still hold up to this day. ""Nanny McPhee"" is one of the biggest ripoffs in the history of cinema. Like I said, this ""movie"" ripped off two different films, ""Mary Poppins"" and ""The Sound of Music"". The crazy thing is, this ""movie"" was written by Emma Thompson herself! How is that possible? Why didn't anyone tell her that she was ripping off those films? How could they green light this ""movie""? If this is any indication of Emma Thompson's writing style, I hope she never writes another script again. In this case, she's a rip-off artist! I'm giving this ""film"" 2 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Do I really have to tell you to avoid this ""movie""? Just watch ""Mary Poppins"" or ""The Sound of Music"" instead. ""Nanny McPhee"" is nothing but a total waste of film making. Don't even think about asking me to subject myself to the pointless sequel! ""Nanny McPhee"" was worthless enough. Mary Poppins and Maria von Trapp would be ashamed!",Nanny McPhee
50,cosmic_quest,Excellent family fun!,8,29 October 2005,"This definitely has to be one of the best films of the year and is something that can be enjoyed by the whole family, from the wee tot to grandparents. Based upon the 'Nurse Matilda' books by Christianna Brand, the film revolves around seven motherless children who have frightened off seventeen nannies much to their over-wrought father's dismay. The children are unruly and their father has his own stresses of desperately searching for a wife before his mean-spirited great aunt cuts off his allowance and everything is falling apart at the seams...until Nanny McPhee enters the house to sort things out. Think of 'Mary Poppins' if Roald Dahl had written the character and you have an idea of what happens next!The best thing about this film is that while it will appeal to children, it doesn't dumb down or indulge in cavity-inducing sweetness that you tend to see in films produced by Hollywood. There is much humour and fun to be had but there is also a darker tone, what with children being threatened with the Work House and their father speaking to corpses!The actors are all excellent. Colin Firth was perfect as this dithering man who may be meek but will do anything for his children and Emma Thompson is totally unrecognisable as the lead character of Nanny McPhee (she also deserves much recognition her skills in script-writing this film). But it's Angela Lansbury, as snooty Great Aunt Adelaide, who steals the show with the way she spends much of the film with such a sour face that could curdle the milk! The children also deserve much praise, especially when you consider most of them are not only very young but had never acted before. I certainly hope to see more of young Raphael Coleman, who played the middle son Eric, in future films as he totally threw himself into his character and was the most engaging of the children.I'd highly recommend this to people who enjoyed 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' (both old and new versions) and 'Matilda'.

I had the misfortune of seeing this at the cinema and I can tell you it is horrendous. Some people have claimed this is a 'modern Mary Poppins'; that would be true except Mary Poppins is a good film and this is well, rubbish.How can I be so malicious towards a kind-hearted kid's film? I love many family films, but none of them (or maybe 1 or 2) have bored me as much as this.I would go as far as calling this film depressing. It's so dull, monotonous and dragged on that I have nothing good to say about it. If I did I wouldn't rate it a 2/10.2/10",Nanny McPhee
53,gregeichelberger,"Long on weirdness, short on everything else",2,21 August 2012,"Originally published on Jan. 24, 2006:If Mel Brooks and Quentin Tarrentino had teamed up to direct ""Mary Poppins,"" you might get an idea what kind of movie this new Universal release is. With the exception that their version would at least been interesting - and funny.Basically, an English nanny, played by Emma Thompson (Oscar winner for ""Sense & Sensibility""), arrives mysteriously, saves a floundering family, headed by a nincompoop father, Cedric Brown (Colin Firth, ""Bridget Jones's Diary,"" ""Love Actually""), and then leaves.It's Victorian England (I think) and the seven Brown children (a septet of adorable, precocious Brit tots) are so awful, they have chased away 17 – count 'em – nannies, although, for some reason, the cook, Miss Blatherwick (Imelda Stauton, ""Vera Drake"") and the scullery maid, Evangeline (Kelly Macdonald, ""Finding Neverland,"" ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy""), seem to have no problems remaining. In fact, Evangeline is so good with the children, I thought she should have been the nanny and that would have been the end of it. Since dad, a mortician, lost his wife (who could blame her for dying – or running away – with these horrid little monsters underfoot), he has not paid much attention to his vile brood. Listen, given a choice between preparing dead bodies for burial or taking care of these goons, I'd opt for the former, as well.For some reason, the kids all take their cue from the oldest boy, Simon (Thomas Sangster, ""Triston & Isolde""), even though he is not even the eldest kid. It's his scheme to get rid of as many nannies as his father employs. No one really knows the reason why, it just sets up the plot of having Nanny McPhee arrive and do her magic work. She shows up on dark and stormy night while the kids are destroying the kitchen (after putting up with ""Yours, Mine & Ours"" and ""Cheaper By The Dozen,"" if I see one more sequence of a pack of unruly brats messing up a house for no good reason, I think I'll move to China where only one child per family is the law of the land).Of course, Father Brown, who sits around reading the newspaper and nervously wondering how he can control his kids (it's the same ridiculous situation Steve Martin went through in the ""Cheaper By The Dozen"" films - no father of seven children in the world does not know how to take care or discipline their offspring), is completely powerless to do anything about it.Anyway, as the kitchen is being wrecked (the tykes also manage to tie the cook to a table, even though she served in the army and is supposed to be really tough), McPhee enters and tells Brown she has five rules to teach. She is also facially-challenged, with moles, warts, a bulbous nose, a una-brow and a large protruding front tooth.She quietly enters the kitchen, demands the kids stop and clean it up. When they refuse, she bangs her twisted walking stick and they children slip into another dimension and start doing stuff really fast. When the baby is about to be boiled (don't ask), the stubborn Simon apologizes and all is made right again. I suppose if you have to ability to use magic or some other dark, supernatural power, you can accomplish almost anything, including getting a bunch of unruly idiots to bed.In addition, once a rule is taught to the kids, an ugly feature disappears from McPhee's face. We are not told why, however.McPhee stays, despite Simon's efforts to get rid of her (none work), but another complication arises when Brown's Aunt Adelaide (Angela Landsbury), who has been paying rent on the large house, wants to take one of the little girls, Kristina, and raise her. Actually, compared to the chaos in the Brown home, this isn't the worst idea, but, of course, McPhee intercedes and in one of the creepiest (and worst) examples of recent CGI, makes a donkey stand up on its hind legs and perform a two-step, which distracts the doddering old woman.Eventually, Evangeline goes with Adelaide, while Brown is forced to marry – another of Adelaide's decrees – the quacking, pasty three-time widow, Mrs. Quickly (Celia Imrie, ""Bridget Jones: The Edge Of Reason""). Naturally, the kids don't like her, so they mess up the wedding with a pie fight. Okay, here's another problem I had with this film. A pie fight has not been funny in a movie since 1948, when ""The Three Stooges Meet A Brooklyn Gorilla"" was released. It's almost as if the writers could not come up with a decent conclusion and said, ""Hey, let's just have the kids throw around some pies and cakes. It'll be hilarious."" It wasn't.",Nanny McPhee
54,ArizWldcat,Hooray for Emma Thompson!!,8,20 February 2006,"Emma Thompson did a phenomenal job with the screenplay for this movie. It was a charming story, with lots of dry wit. The cast is marvelous too...all of the children seem ""real"" and not too cutesy. Emma herself, as the title character, is calm and funny at the same time. It certainly doesn't hurt that Colin Firth plays the father! (I'd watch him read the dictionary). Kelly MacDonald is also marvelous as Evangeline. And I need to mention Angela Lansbury (who wore a marvelous fake hooked nose...it took me a few minutes to recognize her)...she is also very funny in her role. Lots of great supporting characters, too, like Celia Imrie, Imelda Staunton, Derek Jacobi, and Patrick Barlowe...any fan of British cinema will enjoy the cast.This is a great family movie, though toddlers will be bored...older children will better understand the humor.",Nanny McPhee

57,Benjamin_Cox,A magical modern fairytale - 81%,8,8 March 2006,"I will be one of the first to acknowledge that films featuring a large child cast (or with a Steven Spielberg film, any kid at all) are normally right at the top of my list of films to avoid. I remember watching ""Bugsy Malone"" as a young boy and rather than being entertained, I was profoundly disturbed as a sultry-looking 10-year-old Jodi Foster received endless custard pies to the face. But recent family films have dented my distaste for such movies and here comes another one, Britain's belated answer to the likes of ""Mary Poppins"". I have to say, the trailers that I'd seen nearly put me off watching this and when my Better Half persuaded me to watch (along with my prospective in-laws), I was less than enthusiastic. But blow me - this is yet another fantastic family film with plenty to entertain children and adults of all ages, a colourful visual style and absolutely no Dick Van Dyke. I must be going soft in my old age!Colin Firth plays the long-suffering Mr Brown, a widowed funeral director living in Victorian England and father to seven children. And it's his children that are the cause of his troubles as each one is a tiny tearaway terror, from baby Agnes to eldest Simon. All seventeen of his previous nannies failed to bring the brood under control (the latest leaving in record time and having a nervous breakdown) and to make matters worse, Mr Brown is under pressure to marry before his monstrous Aunt Edna (an almost unrecognisable Angela Lansbury) stops his allowance, forcing him and his family out of their home. Enter a strange-looking woman called Nanny McPhee (creator Emma Thompson) who promises to sort out the unruly children once and for all. But can she actually overcome the children's resistance and before Aunt Edna's deadline expires? This is a delightfully funny family film, a hidden gem of a picture that deserved much better recognition than it got. The feel of the picture is very child-friendly as characters are brightly coloured and comically exaggerated (such as Nanny McPhee's facial features) and while the humour is a little basic, there is enough slapstick of the ""Mousetrap"" variety in there to keep most people happy. The story, while it's as predictable as a Russian general election, is an enjoyable fairytale with enough sugar to disguise the moral of the story for kids. As for acting, I felt it could be better in places. Firth repeats his impression of Hugh Grant to adequate effect while the child cast are mixed. However, Thompson is superb as the magical child-minder and Lansbury is also brilliant, playing the antithesis of all those kindly-grandmother roles she's had over the years under a tonne of prosthetics. So long, Jessica Fletcher and about time too!It would be difficult to say that this is a Disney-beater but this has more enthusiasm, ideas and genuine warmth than Disney's recent outings combined (ignoring Pixar pictures, which I have a huge soft-spot for). This is a brilliant film, designed with children in mind but easily entertaining adults as well. It's like Dr Seuss and Jane Austin rewriting Hans Christian Andersen and as unlikely as it sounds, it works really well. It could have taken more risks and not been quite so predictable but this is a wonderful film that anyone with young kids will want to own on DVD as soon as possible. It's a delight from start to finish and the younger you are, the more you'll get out of it. I'd probably prefer to watch something with Wallace & Gromit in (and their feature film won an Oscar, as I had hoped for!) but this is a perfectly enjoyable family film that took me by surprise. Don't make the same mistake I did, don't dismiss this as Sunday afternoon kiddie-fodder and don't miss out. And personally, it's so much better than ""Mary Poppins""",Nanny McPhee

All in all a fun movie.",Nanny McPhee
61,gee-15,A movie about the lessons we all must learn,7,24 May 2008,"The Brown children (seven in all) have recently lost their mother and have not taken it well. They have driven away a large number of nannies and are thrilled to hear their beleaguered father say that there are no more nannies. Paradise! However, they have not reckoned on the intervention of a most decidedly unorthodox nanny named Nanny McPhee who appears on the doorstep of the Browns just as the children have invaded the kitchen, tied up the cook, and taken to destroying the room.Nanny McPhee differs from other similar cinematic creations (e.g. Mary Poppins) in that she is uncommonly ugly, scary, and during her first interaction with the children displays behaviors more in common with witches than magical nannies. Interestingly, her behavior changes and her appearance improves as the children not only begin employing long lost manners but learn some valuable lessons along the way about decisions and their consequences.As the children get their comeuppance rather early on and begin behaving appropriately, we realize that Nanny McPhee has more lessons to teach than those about manners and more people to teach than just the children.Mr. Brown is an interesting character. He's sympathetically played by Colin Firth which is good because he's easily the wimpiest male character since Ross on ""Friends"". However, Firth's portrayal is that of a loving father who has lost his ability to connect with his children (for some very justifiable reasons). One of the most tender moments in the film is the point when Mr. Brown comes downstairs after finally really speaking to and understanding his children to find Nanny McPhee bathed in shadows. She tells him that Lesson Four is complete. ""Lesson Four?"" he asks. She steps forward from the shadows to say, ""To listen."" And we realize that not only is Nanny McPhee here for the children but for him as well.Some interesting ideas are presented here about appearances and judging by such appearances. It is the scullery maid Evangeline who sees the children for what they are and likes them despite their bad behavior. And it is Mr. Brown who recognizes Evangeline when she re-enters the house cleaned up and changed through her ""adoption"" by Aunt Adelaide. One of the children says, ""she looks like a fairy princess"" and Mr. Brown, smiling says, ""she always looked that way"". Just as the children underestimated the perceptiveness and affection of Evangeline, she in turn underestimated Mr. Brown's. And nobody suspected the lovely person that is Nanny McPhee until the heart-warming climax when she appears completely altered (and looking surprisingly similar to Emma Thompson) to bring the film to its satisfying close.",Nanny McPhee

The story itself is typical and much like the brilliant Mary Poppins. 7 ill-behaved children have scared off their previous 17 nannies and there are none left until comes along Nanny McPhee, an extremely ugly wart faced lady played superbly by Emma Thompson. She has a magic walking stick (not an umbrella) which aids her in making the children behave. She works on the basis of teaching 5 lessons and that when she is wanted and not needed she will leave but when she is unwanted but needed then she will stay. Each time a lesson is forfilled she loses one of her warts or ugly features until when the children become good she is a lovely lady.This movie is not Mary Poppins because it is not a musical but it makes up for this with Emma Thompson.

Emma Thompson did a brilliant job writing a script culled from three separate books and then delivered a performance with a perfect touch of soul and weight. You miss her when she isn't in a scene and when she is, though she has few lines of dialog, you are completely wrapped up in her, begging to see the twinkle in her eye. All of the other characters are as colorfully drawn as the sets, props and wardrobe and the impressive cast is gloriously alive in their portrayals. These are the kinds of roles that must bring actors a dizzy kind of joy because they can turn up the volume at will. Colin Firth is such a multi-dimensional actor that watching his talents play off those of the incomparable Emma Thompson in a single scene is a sinfully rich experience. The child-actors are all up to the task as well, completely natural and unaffected in their parts as rascals. And where did they find the breathtakingly beautiful babe(s) for the role of Baby Agatha? The director, Kirk Jones, had a most artistic eye in presenting a magical story that moves at a swift pace and spills across the screen like a technicolor ice cream sundae with an ever so slight inference of danger. Nanny McPhee is a feast in large and small ways and though, yes, it's a fairytale, we should all thank heaven in this day and age that a group of movie makers can still produce - and has a desire to do so - such a delightful piece of family entertainment that is populated by flesh-and-blood people, not cartoons.",Nanny McPhee

She shows up on dark and stormy night while the kids are destroying the kitchen (after putting up with ""Yours, Mine & Ours"" and ""Cheaper By The Dozen,"" if I see one more sequence of a pack of unruly brats messing up a house for no good reason, I think I'll move to China where only one child per family is the law of the land).Of course, Father Brown, who sits around reading the newspaper and nervously wondering how he can control his kids (it's the same ridiculous situation Steve Martin went through in the ""Cheaper By The Dozen"" films - no father of seven children in the world does not know how to take care or discipline their offspring), is completely powerless to do anything about it.Anyway, as the kitchen is being wrecked (the tykes also manage to tie the cook to a table, even though she served in the army and is supposed to be really tough), McPhee enters and tells Brown she has five rules to teach. She is also facially-challenged, with moles, warts, a bulbous nose, a una-brow and a large protruding front tooth.She quietly enters the kitchen, demands the kids stop and clean it up. When they refuse, she bangs her twisted walking stick and they children slip into another dimension and start doing stuff really fast. When the baby is about to be boiled (don't ask), the stubborn Simon apologizes and all is made right again. I suppose if you have to ability to use magic or some other dark, supernatural power, you can accomplish almost anything, including getting a bunch of unruly idiots to bed.In addition, once a rule is taught to the kids, an ugly feature disappears from McPhee's face. We are not told why, however.McPhee stays, despite Simon's efforts to get rid of her (none work), but another complication arises when Brown's Aunt Adelaide (Angela Landsbury), who has been paying rent on the large house, wants to take one of the little girls, Kristina, and raise her. Actually, compared to the chaos in the Brown home, this isn't the worst idea, but, of course, McPhee intercedes and in one of the creepiest (and worst) examples of recent CGI, makes a donkey stand up on its hind legs and perform a two-step, which distracts the doddering old woman.Eventually, Evangeline goes with Adelaide, while Brown is forced to marry  another of Adelaide's decrees  the quacking, pasty three-time widow, Mrs. Quickly (Celia Imrie, ""Bridget Jones: The Edge Of Reason""). Naturally, the kids don't like her, so they mess up the wedding with a pie fight. Okay, here's another problem I had with this film. A pie fight has not been funny in a movie since 1948, when ""The Three Stooges Meet A Brooklyn Gorilla"" was released. It's almost as if the writers could not come up with a decent conclusion and said, ""Hey, let's just have the kids throw around some pies and cakes. It'll be hilarious."" It wasn't.",Nanny McPhee
70,patlightfoot,Great viewing,9,6 July 2006,"Very much for the young at heart as well as for a younger audience.I thought the screenplay was well put together, and Emma did a great job not only writing it but also acting.I think it was probably almost as good as Mary Poppins, without the special effects and music. It's hard to say really, as MP is a classic. And probably the concept was similar if not as spectacular from a cinematographic perspective.I was pleased to see Angela Lansbury cast in a cameo role. Few people may recall but Angela is English, and went the US to star in National Velvet when she was 16 years of age, and played in Bednobs and Broomsticks back in the 70s.I think we need more films like this, and Narnia as of recent years fantasy seems to have taken a back seat, to Sci-Fi.Loved the concept, and if I get the chance will buy a copy.Pat",Nanny McPhee
71,Edu-16,Nanny McAverage,5,5 February 2006,"I'm normally a great fan of Emma Thompsons - and a sucker for sentimental, magic based films like this one. However, this is not a very good movie for lots of reasons. I can only think the current rating says more for the competition at the moment, and possibly the US's penchant for British movies in general.I didn't feel that the cast really believed in it. Colin Firth and Emma T I thought were miss-cast. Emma T seemed terribly static. Her teeth encouraged her to hold the same pose/ expression all the time - something that I found un-nerving after a while from such a usually fantastic actress. (Suspect job of directing caused her to skimp on her own character). Colin Firth seemed totally lost as an undertaker?!!- and I couldn't help thinking Hugh Laurie might have been a better choice.Overall I thought the film was uneven. The look was inconsistent, and seemed to fall somewhere between Victorian period drama and Charlie and the chocolate factory. The acting was also lumpy - with some being terribly OTT such as Landsbury and Celia Imrie - and others more natural - such as Firth and the servant girl. For a film that much more successfully melds visual and acting styles see 'Lemony Snickerts Unfortunate Events'.The story itself seemed to be terribly predictable - with no surprises. And the last unforgivable crime for a film with so much UK talent - it's not very funny.",Nanny McPhee
72,folsominc2,Disappointment in Cartoonland,2,22 February 2008,"I have to admit that the decision I made to watch Nanny McPhee was because I recently had fallen hard for Colin Firth's version of Mr. Darcy in the A&E production of Pride and Prejudice.Reading the plot of Nanny McPhee, I assumed it would be something of a cross between Mary Poppins and The Sound of Music  modernized. With Colin Firth in it as a widower with seven irascible children and the great Angela Lansbury, I thought it sounded like a delightful farce.Unfortunately, I was mightily disappointed.From beginning to end, this movie is a perfect representation of where the director, writer and other cast members are simply too close to their own product to realize the viewer, like me, has no idea what is going on. Who is Nanny McPhee? Why doesn't the father question her magical powers? Why does her ugliness keep diminishing with each lesson? Why does she take such an avid interest in Evangeline? There is nothing explained, and although it is obvious it was more or less filmed as a cartoon or exaggerated caricatures of the individuals' personalities, I found it a real yawn. Or perhaps half a yawn, because due to the film's speed that it raced through the plot, I really didn't know get to know any of the characters.Colin Firth, although a fine actor, was not used to his potential in this film and was forced into slapstick scenes that were unbelievably dull. There were mainly two scenes I found where the Colin Firth's sincerity shown.The one where he is chasing the carriage in which he believes one of his children has been abducted gives the desperately needed empathy for a few short minutes that the film needed in abundance. The other scene, sad to say, was in the DVD Bonus Features under ""Deleted Scenes"" in where there is another scene of growing romanticism between Mr. Brown and Evangeline. Leaving this scene in would have helped explain the ""letter under the blotter"" scenario that comes up later.Frankly, the part of Mr. Brown more than likely should have been cast with Kenneth Branagh or better yet, Kevin Kline.And finally, the film ends with too many questions and not enough closure. Almost all the characters were featured in the final ""wedding scene"" but what happened to the aunt? Did she die when she passed out? There was no final conclusion between the mysterious nanny and the children.Unfortunately, I found this an extreme disappointment; however, I have found several of Emma Thompson's screenplays of the usual caliber so perhaps I should not have been so surprised.One final note. When I was renting this DVD, I asked in the rental store ""What was it like?"" The only individual out of five who had seen it was a small boy about 10 years old. I asked him if it was funny, and he said, ""Not really."" 'Nuf said!",Nanny McPhee
73,mloessel,Dry as toast,4,5 May 2020,Emma Thompson does a good job as the title character and that's the only praise I can give. The single dad aka Colin Firth and his children did ok. I did manage to make it to the end but that was just out of couriosity.,Nanny McPhee
74,AndrewPhillips,Five lessons = Perfection,9,17 April 2006,"Now I love Emma Thompson, I may have mentioned it before, she is one of the best actresses to come out of the UK. I knew the film was made for children, but I am not adverse to a dose of Mary Poppins, so I had high hopes for this one.I was not disappointed, it was charming, colourful and well acted. The aforementioned Miss Thompson excelled in the title role, bringing a dark humour and depth to the part as only she can. The supporting cast were also on fine form, the kids were good, something that can be a bit hit and miss in movies. Imelda Staunton as the cook was perfect. Dear old Angela Lansbury was dusted off and wheeled out for a great part which she grabbed by the neck and wrung out of it every possible laugh. Kelly Macdonald was very good, I liked her in Gosford Park as well, she plays unassuming with a deft touch. The film though belonged to the monster that was created by Celia Imrie, an actress who has such an amazing range it was worthy of a clutch of acting award nominations, but alas children's films don't often get those. Never mind she is deliciously horrid.Yes there was a predictability to the story, but that did not matter you knew where it was going and you wanted it to get there, just a bit slower so you could enjoy it for longer. Lovely touches; the wedding scene, Nanny becoming beautiful, the two undertaker assistants, fantastic.So well done to all involved, it was as good as Mary Poppins and that, let me tell you, is something, coming from me.",Nanny McPhee
75,kylopod,"Poor man's ""Mary Poppins"" lacks wonder, a sense of fun, or good lessons",3,3 February 2007,"""Nanny McPhee"" begins by showing a group of cheerfully horrible siblings who wreck their house, terrorize the cook, and quickly drive away every nanny their absent father (Colin Firth) hires. He keeps hearing a disembodied voice telling him that ""The person you need is Nanny McPhee."" We presume that if he hires this otherworldly woman, the kids will learn proper behavior, and possibly he will learn proper parenting. It was at this point that I smiled. The setup seemed nearly perfect, promising a fun, quirky kid's movie.But even then, I had some nagging doubts. There was just a bit too much buildup. I realized that the film would have to work hard to make this character live up to expectations. Her entrance is greeted with a thunderstorm, her silhouette possibly intended as a visual allusion to Alfred Hitchcock's famous portly figure. Then we see her warty, bucktoothed face as she enters the mansion and goes to the kitchen where the kids are presently making a big mess. They're just about ready to treat her the same way they've treated all the previous nannies, but then she strikes her walking stick to the ground, and....Well, I won't give away precisely what spells she casts to protect herself from the children's wrath and keep them under control. I'm not out to ruin anyone's fun, what little of it can be found in this film. To understand what went wrong, we need only look back to ""Mary Poppins,"" the most obvious inspiration for this film. One of the special qualities of Julie Andrews' Oscar-winning performance is that she played the character as if she didn't need magical powers to handle the kids. The magic served the same role as it does in most good children's fantasies--to inspire the children's imagination. When that film wanted to make points about parenting, it promptly returned to the real world, where it belonged. In ""Nanny McPhee,"" on the other hand, the magic is simply wishful thinking, an implicit admission by the filmmakers that in the real world they would have no idea how to deal with kids like these except through brute force.Meanwhile, the father is trying to court a rich bitch so that he won't be disinherited by an aunt (Angela Lansbury). The movie wants us to believe that the woman he really ought to marry is his young scullery maid (Kelly MacDonald) even though the chemistry between the two is somewhat less than bristling. The subplot in which the kids attempt to sabotage the father's plans mixes uneasily with the magical material. There is a scene involving a dancing donkey that the aunt is too visually impaired to notice. Yet the father is also standing there and acts as if nothing out of the ordinary has happened!Eventually, the movie resorts to unoriginal slapstick. If you think that kids might like this film, I should mention that the children I was with seemed bored much of the time. The story starts from an adult perspective, and it never bothers to create a sense of wonder in the magical events. Although it tries to have fun with the nanny's powers, it's a bit too pedantic to succeed.Emma Thompson plays the title character with considerable skill, but it's a thankless role. She seems weary and fatigued, not relishing the task at hand. She never shows any affection for the kids, not even tough love, and they don't really come to like her. Their growing appreciation for her is strictly utilitarian, as they find her powers useful in helping them out of sticky situations.The conceit is that the warts and blemishes gradually disappear from Thompson's face as she completes her work on the children, and she will look normal and attractive at the end. We can only guess that she's been the subject of some supernatural curse in the tradition of ""Beauty and the Beast."" I assume that the book on which the movie is based provides some background on the character, but curiously the film never does: we never learn a thing about where she came from or where she'll go when she's done with the kids.The movie has one great line, when Thompson explains to the children, ""When you need me but do not want me, then I must stay. When you want me but no longer need me, then I have to go."" Since the film never develops a convincing bond between her and the family, much less shows how she is able to transform them, the line only serves as a frustrating reminder of what this movie could have been if it had lived up to its promising setup.",Nanny McPhee
76,ElmStreetsLastBrat,This movie was cute!,8,19 February 2007,"At first I had no interest in seeing Nanny McPhee because I don't watch many children's films. But my cousin, who's 23, said it was incredibly cute and funny so she asked me to watch it with her. I thought this movie was so cute! It was funny and imaginative and creative. Emma Thompson is a great actress. I loved her as Nanny McPhee. I loved how ugly she was when you first met her but as she taught Colin Firth's unruly children life lessons she became more beautiful. The children were also too cute. I loved the oldest one, Simon. He looks just like my 7 year old cousin. Acts like him too. I thought the funniest part in this film was when the children were trying to get rid of their father's wicked new fiancée who didn't' care about the children and was only marrying their father for the money. And when they crashed her wedding too. That was hilarious. Angela Lansbury was great as the cantankerous old aunt. She brought some humor to her role too. I thought all the actors were great. You had to feel some sympathy for Colin Firth as the overstressed dad with seven small unruly children who can't keep a nanny. Emma Thompson was perfect for the role as Nanny McPhee, although she never disappoints. This film was so cute and stylish and I'm glad I saw it. I think this is a good film for the children too. It's never boring and it is really funny. There are no scenes that are too intense for the children either, like most of today's ""children's"" films. This is a good film for parents too. Thanks for reading my review! ~LaTissa~",Nanny McPhee
77,divyanka,Boring Story that had Potential,5,11 January 2019,"This story had potential but oh dear it is SO boring. The plot isn't even interesting. The idea of nanny mcphee is great but not well executed throughout the movie. It is not fully explained as to why the nanny's ugly traits disappear as the story goes on. Also, her participation in the movie isn't all that much as it could have been. It doesn't have the same type of charisma as mary poppins.",Nanny McPhee
78,tollini,Truly Moving Picture,10,21 January 2006,"This film was specially shown on January 17, 2006 in Indianapolis. I am one of the judges for the Heartland Film Festival that screens films for their Truly Moving Picture Award. A Truly Moving Picture ""explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life."" Heartland gave that award to this film.There are seven rather naughty children who have creatively and gleefully drove away seventeen nannies who tried to tame them. But they have met their match with the hideous looking Nanny McPhee played by Emma Thompson. Thompson wrote the screenplay and with great make-up plays Nanny McPhee. Thompson is a consummate artist and is the only person ever to have won an Oscar for writing (""Sense and Sensibility"") and also to have won an Oscar for acting (""Howard's End). Thompson brings class to this Victorian-era, dark, fractured fairy tale.This is a laugh out loud farce. And young people and old can share in the humor. While the film is designed for kids, the adult accompanying the child will enjoy it almost as much.There are positive messages, for parent and child, throughout the film. The seven children are taught to listen and to be courteous and to be responsible and to think through things for themselves, and you watch their behavior evolve. In the beginning, goodness looks ugly to the children. But as they learn what goodness truly is, it takes on a beautiful appearance.FYI  There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where there is a listing of past Truly Moving Picture Award winners that are now either at the theater or available on video.",Nanny McPhee
79,chimera-4,Absolutely ridiculous,5,2 September 2007,"I don't understand all the high ratings for this movie it was totally stupid. Now I'm up for as much silly fun as the next guy but all this movie did was try to rehash Mary Poppins and it had none of the magic of that movie (although it didn't have any songs either which some might call a plus). Nanny McPhee herself was completely devoid of any personality or character and the whole thing just didn't add up to anything more than the sum of it's parts (which consisted of an idea that had already been done, a decent budget and a couple of good character actors). It just didn't gel together. I just sat there waiting for something clever or amusing to happen and it never did.I did get some satisfaction out of the fact that someone somewhere (even if it was in a movie) recognized some of the pain I'm going through at the moment (we have 4 kids and while nowhere near as naughty as the kids in this movie they still test our patience at times)and thought it would be flippin great if some Nanny McPhee type character turned up to sort them out once in a while. While she was a cardboard cutout I can't deny some of her powers would come in handy once in a while. I've also got to say that the idea at the beginning of the movie that the kids had eaten the baby and you saw bits of what later turned out to be chicken with booties and fluffy pink mittens on was a bit sick for a kids film. My 4 year old was pretty horrified at the idea that people ate babies even it was only a movie.So all up a stale idea with a crap script that someone figured if they chucked enough money at it and got some respected actors in there then it wouldn't matter. Well it would seem from some peoples ratings on here that apparently it didn't which is just going to set us up to receive more of the same.Thank you, drive through.....",Nanny McPhee
80,showgirl626,Absolutely Brilliant,10,25 January 2008,"This movie is amazing! Emma Thompson's screen writing skills are beyond reproach! Angela Lansbury was a scream, Colin Firth the perfect bumbler, Simon and the other kids were all wonderful in their respective roles, and each was integral to the plot. In fact, everybody was great, every THING was fabulous - the incidental music, the lighting...I could go on and on...but Emma T. was a joy to behold as Nanny McPhee. Yeah, okay, it's a kid's movie, but this film transcends age. Anybody from 3 to 103 could get something from this movie.The tiniest details - from Nanny's gentle bow in the general direction of a certain chair, her compelling yet gentle gaze at Simon while he sits in the tree house with his siblings pondering the agonizing decision they have to make, Cook's wonderful twitchiness, Evangeline, Mrs. Quickly...it was all mesmerizing. I just bought it on DVD and barely had it out of the box before I watched it again. And again. And again.It's about respect. It's about living with the consequences of your actions. It's about sacrifice. It's about not just love, but the power of love. It's a treasure trove of lessons wrapped with a dash of magic to share with your family. It's a clever, wonderful treat. Far and away one of the best live-action family films that I think I've ever seen. Let's give it an 11 out of 10.A GREAT film! Enthusiastically recommended! Enjoy!",Nanny McPhee

I've loved her for years and she never disappoints. She shines in this movie about a magical nanny and her horrible charges. Based on the Nurse Matilda books, this film manages to do what I thought was impossible. It manages to 'one up' Mary Poppins. Granted there're no tunes and there's no dancing but there is a lot of heart and warmth.Does Nanny McPhee really get better looking as the movie goes on or is she better looking because we no longer see the horrible outside but the glowing inside? Ponder that while you watch her manage the children and their ditz of a father played by Colin Firth.Heartwarming is the only word that can describe this picture. Rent it. Better yet BUY it.

Emma Thompson is truly great as the film's title character. The other cast members are also very overwhelming! This picture made me very happy! Nanny McPhee is brought to the attention of a man with seven children because McPhee is just the person he needs to end his seemingly awful dilemma. You see, Nanny McPhee is no ordinary nanny; she possesses magical powers that can practically do the impossible. As a result, the children learn to respect her and most everyone else as well.Out of all the scenes that are featured in this movie, I liked it most when the nanny used her powers to make a donkey dance on two feet. During this scene, I was laughing very-I mean-very hard! This is easily one of the best remembered moments in the whole entire film.The movie closes very pleasantly, too, with a wedding scene where utter chaos breaks out and everyone gets messy! After the mayhem is over though, a very happy ending is taking place.This is one DVD that I definitely intend on buying!",Nanny McPhee
86,johnmcc150,Dire,3,1 November 2005,"This is probably the most embarrassing thing done by Emma Thompson since her one-woman show. Although it is a children's film, this is an insufficient excuse for a tedious, predictable script. Emma's friendship with much of the excellent cast must have been sorely tested. It was supposed to be a morality tale, but its main proposition is that any problem can be solved by magic. We could have seen real magic by showing how a human nanny might cope with a dysfunctional family. You will have to love your children greatly to sit through this film and meanwhile you will worry that you are giving them the equivalent of a meringue: sickly sweet and insubstantial.",Nanny McPhee

Angela performed amazingly and was tremendously convincing in her role. After playing sweet Jessica for over 10 years she easily portrayed a horrid old lady, Adelaide. She give a good performance and deserves a best supporting actress award. Colin Firth performed reasonably well and Emma Thompson gave a decent performance also. The magic was certainly there and hit right on target for it's specific genre and target audience but it wasn't as developed as it could have been. It could have been a bit better. Never the less a good family movie. But the main credit most certainly has to go to Angela Lansbury, an absoulute legend. I hope she does some more films in the future and follows the likes of Maggie Smith and Judi Dench. Please tell me if Angela is doing anymore work in the future.",Nanny McPhee
88,Travis_Moran,One of us liked It; The other one...hmmm,7,23 February 2006,"by Travis & Annette.For the most part this was an enjoyable movie. And it's a fine choice for family entertainment.ANNETTE: Nanny McPhee's character was my favourite. She has excellent stage presence. Mr. Brown was my second choice. He was actually lovable in a puppy-dog sort of way. The kids were cute but not especially notable. They filled out the purpose of the story fine, but I didn't find myself warming to them much.TRAVIS: This is not my type of movie, but I'll try to be fair about it. I also liked Nanny McPhee the best, but the rest could've easily put me to sleep. I felt the only decent characterisation was McPhee. Kid actors sometimes get on my nerves a bit, and these were an incessant reminder of that fact.ANNETTE: Once scene in particular seemed a bit out of character for the rest of the movie...the dancing donkey. But I was so enchanted by the snowy wedding scene. I would like to be married like that. I also enjoyed the food fight more than I usually do that type of thing.TRAVIS: I ain't getting married in the snow! But it wasn't a bad scene. Often during this film, I was very much reminded of ""Mary Poppins"" and that ""Lemony Snicket"" movie (both of which I didn't really care about much). Now, if I had kids, I would still feel really good about having em watch this film; But, for me, even tho I feel it's a decent movie, it's just not my genre. Predictably, the food fight was my favourite scene.Our combined rating was 7 on this.ANNETTE: I felt this was a good production, with decent acting and a very good story. Great for families. I'm giving it a 9.TRAVIS: A 5 is about my limit on this type of stuff. Even ""Mary Poppins"" couldn't get much more out of me even tho it was highly rated.

89,ArmsAndMan,The Empty Chair,8,10 February 2006,"Emma Thompson fearlessly works with seven children and a barnyard of animals -- not to mention ugly-face make-up -- and she never once is upstaged.My only complaint is about Colin Firth, who has a thankless role, but I've never found him all that interesting anyway.My 9-year-old daughter, an avid Harry Potter fan, enjoyed the magic of the story and its rich layers of morality. At a key moment, creative obedience to an adult instruction leads to a slapstick showdown that delighted every kid in the theater, including me.There are moments of peril and cruelty, a villain worthy of Dickens, even corpses in the father's place of business, but nothing presented here is worse than everyday life that all children endure. One of the most poetic understatements in any kid film occurs with the first shot: an empty chair, once occupied by a loving mother.Nanny McPhee arrives to teach the unruly children, but the grown-ups have the most to learn about loss, honesty, and true love.",Nanny McPhee

The way the female characters are shown / act is over the top and blatantly bad, The kids were just half-annoying throughout the show. Best character was Mr. brown IMO, his story was more of a side story.The way the nanny handles problems, she solved them to simply and seemed to be moving through the story faster than it should have. The most backlash she got was kids yelling at her. Not to say they don't ""prank"" anyone else. It didn't feel like there was much conflict going on, she showed up, tamed them and it followed through with Mr. browns plot-line fine.The way the characters were so oblivious to some thing was irritating, the scene with Ms. quickie comes to mind first, with frog, bugs, etc and she never even looked up. The comedy was so obvious and over the top, i didn't find the show funny.In the end it was an average watch but the majority of the cast, jokes and plot annoy me a bit.

Her ""lessons"" would benefit most households today.Emma Thompson's acting & screenplay are excellent, but Thomas Sangster, as the oldest Brown sibling, sparkles as the ring leader of this band of nanny marauders.Fine performances by Colin Firth, Angela Landsbury, and Kelly McDonald make this a very entertaining movie that will provide wholesome fun for family members of all ages.",Nanny McPhee

It gets louder the more unrealistic and ridiculous the movie becomes. And it reaches levels of pointlessness that i didn't even know about.

It really was a lot of fun and quite the breath of fresh air for children's movies since the slump between The Incredibles and now.The actors are perfectly cast. So often children can only distract from a movie with very few turning in believable performances.

98,teelbee,"lots of good characters, good acting, and fairly well paced: 8 out 10,",7,29 January 2006,"I thought it was a good-to-almost-great movie - lots of good characters, good acting, and fairly well paced: 8 out 10. I deducted points for the corny stuff with the donkey, the tea scene with Father and The Strumpet, and the pie fight. A little buffoonery goes a long way, yah know? Emma Thompson was brilliant as as the taciturn nanny - all the more amazing as she had few lines and the expressionless demeanor expected of the serving class in Victorian England. She had to convey the Nanny's power and strength of character just by the look in her eye.Age has not dimmed Angela Landsbury's star. She showed us she could still interpret a role with an almost uncanny sense of the character's essence.Colin Firth played the hapless father - a bit broadly in my opinion, but not ~too~ terribly over the top. Thomas Sangster (the boy from Love Actually) was terrific in the role of the eldest brother - ringleader of chaos. The other children all gave better than competent performances - even the little baby. Kelly MacDonald was just okay in her ingénue role.As for the plot, it's not entirely original but an entertaining story even so. Motherless children running wayward - trampling over a series of unfortunate nannies and their father. Nanny McPhee, with her magical cane, aims to reform this dysfunctional family. Although it is not a musical, you will be reminded of Mary Poppins, the Sound of Music, and My Fair Lady as elements from all three tales are incorporated in Nanny McPhee.While it may or may not become as treasured a classic as any of those three preceding movies, it is truly wonderful and well very worth going seeing.",Nanny McPhee

Although the music sweeps you away and the story is pretty typical ""princess on the white horse"" with some mischief, which is pretty attractive for children and well made, it is however full of bad values for children. And because the movie is so well made for the eyes and ears of children -though a bit too simplistic for for adults- it has high potential of making your children believe and behave as if there are some people who don't deserve respect in this world and we all live in a big hiërarchy, pyramid system, where ""bottom"" people deserve only misery. Although the world is more or less like this, it doesn't have to be and films like this only contribute to it. Even some of the ""good"" people of the story are clearly put aside for the merit of the main characters. This is one of the typical old style, conservative fairy tails we need to shy away from.

100,robertblanton,Excellent for children and adults,10,19 February 2006,"I am 56 years old. I normally do not care for ""children's movies."" Even as a child I did not care for children's movies. My movie heroes were adults.However, this movie is one the rare exceptions to my stated preference.Nanny McPhee is a wonderful movie. Though it is a children's movie, the script is written so that it can be enjoyed on an adult level. It reminds me somewhat of a cross between ""Miracle on 34th Street,"" ""The Wizard of Oz,"" and ""The Parent Trap,""(the one with Hayley Mills). It is funny, poignant, mysterious, supernatural and fanciful.Here are some other things I enjoyed about this film: 1. It treats its audience with respect. Unlike most of today's films (which assume movie goers are idiots) it presents a story with a logical beginning, middle and ending, so that if you accept the world it creates, that world can be followed to its satisfying conclusion.2. The children act like--children! No mini-adults here, who are filled with all Macully Caulkin knowledge and wisdom so that if only--if only--the adults would just simply listen to them--why then, the world would be a perfect place where everyone would just get along so well together. No, these children need direction, love, understanding and discipline, and those themes are ones this movie explores.3. It is literate. The script writer, actress Emma Thompson, uses language in a manner designed to communicate rather than to just make a bunch of noise while pretending to say something while saying nothing. In conclusion, I earlier stated that I do not care for most children's movies. (Oh, there are exceptions--""A Christmas Story"" comes to mind.) So, if I say it's good, believe me, it is good.I have purposely not revealed much of the plot. Go see the movie and allow the plot to reveal itself to you. You'll be glad if you do, and you will have participated in a truly satisfying movie going experience. I promise. Cross my heart and hope to die.",Nanny McPhee
101,mimacdon4,This movie has appeal for all ages..it's delightful,10,31 January 2006,"This movie has appeal for all ages. It has a great story with some practical lessons.Set in Victorian England, it centers on recent widower Cedric Brown, a make-up artist for the dearly departed, and his brood of seven quite unruly children. The children, lead by Simon (Thomas Sangster ), have sent away 17 nannies. The agency is fresh out of nannies. What is a parent to do? A mysterious voice whispers 'Nanny McPhee'.She knocks at their door to offer her services and Mr. Brown cautiously accepts her offer. She says she is a 'government Nanny'. Hmmm. What she finds a family that has lost their way. Their father is under threat of financial ruin and loss of his children if he does not marry within a month.With quiet grace and aplomb, Nanny McPhee gradually works her magic with this family. The family is really suffering a disconnect, of sorts. Their world has been turned upside down by their mum's untimely death. Their father, being thrust into this dire situation and trying to deal with his own grief, can neither help them nor himself. Nanny Mcphee teaches them how to work together again as well as to listen to each other, Mr. Brown included.All these lessons are imparted with lots of humor. It gave me some real belly laughs by way of a dancing donkey, a real pie fight and even unlikely snow in August. It also has a bit of romance via the secret crush of Evangeline (Kelly MacDonald), the scullery maid, for Mr. Brown and vice versa.It brags a great supporting cast of veteran actors made up of Angela Lansbury as beak-nosed, frightful Great Aunt Adelaide, Imelda Staunton as the red-faced, wild-haired Mrs. Blatherwick, Celia Imrie as the garish and vulgar Mrs. Selma Quickly.Emma Thompson is brilliant as Nanny Mcphee who undergoes a radical physical change in conjunction with the family's progress. It begs the question of perception. Does she change or does their perception of her change? Colin Firth shows us that he has some tricks up his sleeves as well; he pulls slapstick, poignancy, drama and romance out of his little black bag. He is the glue that holds it all together. Long live the Brown family!",Nanny McPhee
102,almaa31,Good fun!,8,3 August 2008,"I really really had a good time watching this film, just exactly what I needed to escape a bit exactly what movies used to be when I was a child. Some will say it's way too predictable but some It's not a movie aiming at delivering a high level of suspense. It's a good tale with some wise moments. I especially like the parts when Nanny McPhee let the children take their own decisions and warn them about the consequences. I personally find this in real life to be an extraordinary way of dealing with children. The filming and set are beautiful (though I found the colors way too loud) and some moments are really funny exactly the sort of things children candidly laugh at (tricks played by the children, food fight). The thing I didn't like so much is that the relationship between Mr Brown and Evangeline is not really developed in the first part of the movie. He doesn't even seem to show any interest in her whatsoever. Even though we know from the start they'll get married at the end, it's kind of abrupt when they declare their love to each other. Small children will like this film as well as any grown up who's got a good dose of nostalgia and who kept one's child's spirit.",Nanny McPhee
103,LigiaMontoya,"Fun movie, but could have been better",7,20 February 2006,"Nanny McPhee is enjoyable, and by all means should be seen by any film lover. But it should have better - it has a good concept, it has great acting, it has a fun story, so it should have been *terrific.* But it isn't terrific - it's just good. A bit more attention to cleaning up plot details would have put it over the top. There are real plot problems.Negatives: 1) Some plot twists are completely projected. You see them coming a mile away.2) The climax is really unconvincing and seems to have been thrown together. You could even call it hackneyed. I don't know, maybe they were running out of money or time. And that's bad for a movie's climax. But by the time it comes, you already like the characters and the movie, so you are willing to let them get away with it. But it should have been better. I'm trying to not write spoilers, but I mean really - a food fight? And the ""trick"" that the kids play to win at the end is really just foolish, and wouldn't actually fool anyone.Positives: 1) The acting. I love Emma Thompson, and I'm glad to see her writing a screenplay. *All* of the acting is good. Thompson, Jacobi, Lansbury are, of course, but so are the actors I never heard of.2) The movie portrays a pleasant sort of fantasy Victorian world that is always fun to visit.The characters. The Title Character is one that can easily become a classic, and I think Emma Thompson might have written it just so she could play her. The kids are great, and the movie successfully makes you sympathize with them, even after portraying them as little monsters. The same for the Dad.The movie is almost *corny*, but you can't help liking it, simply because you like the *people* and because you *want* it to be real.I can't give it a high rating because of the flaws, but it's certainly worth seeing.",Nanny McPhee
104,ktgc,Moderate Fun,7,27 January 2006,"Nanny McPhee is a movie that tries to teach both children and adult 5 different lessons. The movie is as predictable as many other average children movies. The movie opens with the father talking about how naughty his children are and the children are in need of some behavior education. Then Nanny McPhee shows up and she is a witch who uses her magical wand (or stick) to teach the children five lessons. The story is simple and well intended. Emma Thompson did a good job in acting as Nanny McPhee and it is delightful to see her coming in and out the screen like a witch. However, the children are not remarkable, except for Simon who got the most screen time among the children. The director is wise to keep the movie short. Overall this movie is not a bad movie, however, it is not an outstanding movie either.",Nanny McPhee

As a parent, you know (or will know one day) we have to sit through some awful films (sometimes more than once). So when an enjoyable film comes along...you embrace it! :o) The plot was, needless to say, extremely predictable. However, I never tire of good beats evil and everyone lives happily ever after (oops, was that a spoiler?) The cast is an over kill; the movie doesn't need big names to work but I'm glad they were there. It's a charming film and I was sorry to see it end so quickly. You just can't go wrong with this film.

106,lastdomino,A Perfect Fairy Tale,10,13 February 2006,"It is hard to capture a perfect fairytale in this modern world. Yet, the makers of Nanny McPhee did find one with the necessary ingredients. Children are not unrealistically good. Adults are not perfect nor truly evil; just like normal selfish adults. The magic in the story comes from one person and spreads to the other characters. The story, while not set in our modern times, certainly hints at some modern themes.There was brilliant use of lighting and colors to portray moods and emotions. Dark intense colors gave the home more of a sense of mourning and growing anger. As life becomes for fairytale-like, the colors, though the same shade, seem to lighten and become more welcoming.As for actors, I loved Colin Firth as the father. The children really behaved as if they were actually siblings - working together and fighting all the time. Kelly McDonald was sweet and Emma Thompson was incredible.While this may not be for everyone, I do think that the story has something for both children and adults.",Nanny McPhee
107,rfsavio,Update on Mary Poppins with a twist,10,24 May 2006,"This film is fantastic. It is a modern day Mary Poppins in that the unsolicited nanny turns up at the most opportune moment to set things right in a rather upended household. The stereotypical bumbling father of seven (widowed, of course) is a bit over the top in his total surrender to the antics of his brood of semi-maniacal children who run other Nannys out of the house and pretty much rule the roost.When the rather unpleasant looking Nanny McPhee arrives on the scene there is the inevitable battle of wills with the children led by the rather sinister Simon. Nanny, since she has magic on her side, soon lets the children know that THEY are responsible for whatever happens to them and what does happen to them is a direct result of THEIR choices.As each negative situation is resolved one or other of Nanny's ""deformaties"" vanishes from her face and as she becomes more pleasant in appearance there is a corresponding shift in the pleasantness of the children's behaviour.In brief the film teaches as well as entertains. Children of ages nine and above will see, clearly, that THEY alone are responsible for the choices they make in ANY given situation and that to THINK before they act will assure more tolerable results.The film is entertaining, funny and a bit more of a moral lesson than one got from Mary Poppins.Gather your brood, put on the DVD and spend a most enjoyable evening with Nanny McPhee!",Nanny McPhee

""The most fearless nanny in all the land"" did not last long!

109,sivartis,Talking babies are always creepy.,6,24 January 2006,"Nanny McFee is unabashedly a fairy tale. It's important to say this up front because if not viewed through the eyes of someone watching a fairy tale, one could conceivably come up with an array of complaints about the film. However, it is a fairy tale, it is obviously trying very much to be a fairy tale, and in that regard, it succeeds admirably.The film stars Colin Firth as Cedric Brown, the widower father of seven unruly little brats who pride themselves on the speed with which they scare away nannies. They are almost comically naughty, highlighted by an introduction where they pretend to eat their baby sibling in order to get rid of nanny #17. Mr. Brown is at his wits end when he runs out of nannies to hire, and he hears a voice say ""Nanny McFee is who you need."" It was a bit disappointing when McFee (played perfectly by Emma Thompson, who also wrote the screenplay) shows up at the Brown Manor front door, without any effort on Mr. Brown's part to get her there, but then, it's only a fairy tale. The challenge in the story comes when Brown is given an ultimatum by his wealthy great aunt (Angela Lansbury wonderfully channeling a cranky nearsighted tortoise) to either get married by month's end, thereby providing the children with a necessary mother figure, or cease to receive her monthly stipend, which is all that is keeping the Brown family in their home and together.Twists and turns are not the goal of Nanny McFee. You know who Mr. Brown is going to marry the moment you see her. You know that the children are going to learn to love Nanny McFee and that she's going to have to leave them when they do. McFee is not about surprises for the viewer. It's about getting lost in a fairy tale. I believe that for the most part, this movie achieves everything it tries to achieve. I only wish I had been able to enjoy it with a niece or nephew, to get their point of view. My guess is, kids will love it. Mary Poppins it isn't. It doesn't have the depth, and it feels heavy-handed at times (well, most of the time). At some points McFee seems too colorful, the gags too cartoony. Plus, Mary Poppins was smart enough not to have a talking baby in it, and I'm sorry, fairy tale or no, talking babies are always creepy.Besides that small flaw, and a really loud presentation at my theater, I enjoyed Nanny McFee. It's definitely aimed at the kids, but grownups won't be completely uninterested watching it. The performances by everyone in the cast were fantastic, with special kudos going to the children. Finding seven children who can convincingly play their roles is challenging to say the least. A standout from the young group is Thomas Sangster (Love Actually) as the ringleader older brother Simon, the last to accept Nanny McFee into his heart (awww.). The film has a satisfying final scene but never answers the question; who is Nanny McFee? Well, it's either a good conversation starter for the family or a question to be answered in the sequel.",Nanny McPhee
110,verdie,Don't let the trailers fool you,8,31 January 2006,"I almost missed this one because I was turned off by the commercials and previews, with their emphasis on the silliest parts (the dancing donkey, etc.). What a mistake that would have been -- I'd have missed one of the driest, archest, loveliest scripts in years. Emma Thompson can do more with a slightly quirked eyebrow and a quiet ""Hm"" than most actresses can with an entire Shakespearean soliloquy. The whole cast, children and adults alike, is pretty near perfect, some of the best of the British theater even in the tiniest roles (Derek Jacobi, Imelda Staunton et al).

If you are going to introduce your kids to quality film for children, you will truly go wrong if you don't just show them the classic....Mary Poppins.I've seen Emma Thompson in several movies: Henry V, Sense and sensibility, In the Name of the Father, Junior, and this piece of visual trash..... which is by far her worst film.The BS about the Aunt and her demands that he marry or get cut off......a well-overused idea.Evangeline was the obvious one for him from the first ..... Mrs. Quickly and her ""Evil Stepmother role"" another bit too overworked rubbish.One should not be surprised by the huge number of positive reviews from the masses.

Emma Thompson, after her portrayal of Professor Trelawney in ""Prisoner of Azkaban"", delivers another beautiful performance as Nanny McPhee. I loved Angela Lansbury as the nearly blind, stuff-shirted aunt. Ms. Celia Imrie, whom I had never before heard of, really sold me on the self-centered Selma Quickly. Of course Colin Firth plays a wonderful father figure, and Kelly MacDonald as well for her performance as Evangeline. The setting and plot were wonderful. The ending is totally righteous. I'd say Nanny McPhee is ""Mary Poppins"" for the new millennium. Yes, it is hard not to compare it with that beloved work of Julie Andrews, but what can you do?

The movie brings lots of smiles, groans, and the occasional ""yuck!"" and I left the theater feeling a bit warmer and happier without really being able to say exactly why. My children, ages 6 and 11, also enjoyed it greatly.The movie is based on the Tales of Nurse Matilda, which I began reading to my six-year-old before we saw the movie. (She was confused by the change in name, so we decided that her whole name must be Matilda McPhee.)

True, there are a few outrageous moments, and the characters do take situaitons to the extreme, but that should be expected in a world created by the lovely Emma Thompson.I don't believe in elaborating on plot and ruining the chances of someone being unable to experience a film on their own, but do watch, own, and encourage others to check out this film.When the film ended, I wanted more Nanny McPhee and (sad, but true) eagerly hope for her to return. ""Nanny McPhee Returns,"" anyone? ...anyone? Okay maybe not, but the characters and story were produced brilliantly.I will add, rather than comparing this film to Mary Poppins, it reminds me more of a story I heard in grade-school. I forget the name, but it's about a Teacher who has the rudest and most out of control students. One day she doesn't show up for work, and a substitute teacher (a very wicked looking and mean woman) appears and slaps some respect into the class... the next day the teacher returns and her students are behaved. The book ends with the teacher in her home, and a very familiar ensemble (worn by the substitute teacher) resting in her closet. You know the book, right?

116,bassez_love,"Good, clean fun for the entire family",7,15 September 2006,"After this movie, I may have to admit to being a bit of a pervert. (ALL HAIL THE ADORABLENESS THAT IS THOMAS SANGSTER!!!!!11) Then again, Thomas Sangster turns 16 this May, so it's not that big an age gap. But I digress. I had to note the similarities between Nanny McPhee and The Sound Of Music and Mary Poppins (wow, Julie Andrews certainly has a taste for nanny-roles). Rascally children, several fed up nannies, and then the heroine who swoops in to teach them all a lesson, sometimes with a little bit of magic  though never too cruelly, or underhandedly (though that, I concede, is debatable). And of course, there is the scene where the nanny leaves once the children are well behaved.The style of the movie, on the other hand, reminded me very much of A Series Of Unfortunate Events, which I also enjoyed more than I probably should have, Klaus (Liam Aiken) being a major plus point. On top of that, there were plenty of gorgeous shots of scenery or quaint cottages, which was all very nice, if sometimes lacking in depth.What really drew me in was the exploration of the father-child relationship, though. The bumbling, busy Mr. Brown struggling to keep his family afloat on their measly allowance and his loneliness at bay, distancing between himself from his children in the process, and the adverse effects that that distance had on his children. It was lovely to witness, especially as they reestablished their connection. Certain scenes, like the one where Mr. Brown thinks Aunt Adelaide has taken Christianna away and he chases the horse-drawn carriage all the way into the middle of the woods, just slayed me. As did the scene where Mr. Brown tells Christianna to pick a story for him to read to them, like he used to do.Acting-wise, the movie wasn't half bad. Aunt Adelaide was a delight to watch, with her largely deformed nose and her failing eyesight that all the pompousness in the world couldn't save; even Mrs. Quickly, horrific a character as she was, pulled it off with such enthusiasm that I couldn't help but smile when she was on screen. Mr. Brown gave a convincing performance as a resigned father in a world where everyone was against him, and Evangeline and the other children (even the baby! The adorable little baby!) did pretty decent jobs of playing their parts. Then, to top it off, both Nanny McPhee and Simon were absolutely stellar. I loved how ugly Nanny McPhee looked in the beginning, and then how, as the children learned their lessons, her blemishes  like the warts and her huge nose  began fading, one by one, and then the gorgeous Emma Thompson was allowed to appear in true form. (She is such a beautiful woman, honestly. Also, I was rather impressed by the fact that she wrote the screenplay for this movie.) In fact, what was, I could say impressive, about this film was that they managed to show that class distinction does matter (as shown in Evangeline's self-deprecating remark about herself not being educated and thus not good enough for Mr. Brown). This is a family movie, no doubt, but the implications of social standings and even independence, or a lack thereof  Mr. Brown's reliance on Aunt Adelaide's money  was nicely done.I was a little iffy about the use of magic in the movie, though. It was fun, especially when the children were the ones receiving the brunt of it, like the scene near the start of the film where Nanny McPhee magicks it so they have to continue their mischief in the kitchen against their will, but at the end during the wedding, when Nanny McPhee makes snow start to fall and turns Evangeline's ruined dress into a long, white wedding gown, it just felt like Kirk Jones had taken it a little over the top. Children not questioning Nanny McPhee's power, I can understand, but for all that to happen in front of a crowd of grown men and women? Such an elaborate, and worse, blatant, display of magic just isn't something they would have accepted.Good, clean fun for the entire family, and a well-needed break from the recent trend of terrorism-based movies, long biographical films, and all round recycled fluff.",Nanny McPhee

118,uppyjc,Great movie,10,19 February 2006,"OK, I was a little dubious to begin with. Why would I want to see a film about a nanny teaching a bunch of badly behaved kids? Well, I'm glad I did. The film opens well, immediately dumping in a huge dose of humour. We are introduced to the characters quickly but naturally. It's charming from start to finish. It's very well written, with just the right dose of humour throughout. It never becomes over the top in anyway, but yet kept me interested throughout. I guess in a way I could associate myself with the children. Although not as badly behaved as them, I was never an angel myself (still not to an extent). But yet its so funny, and the schemes thought up by the children are believable. I think this is what helps it to be amusing. No film for kids would be complete without the happy ending and this film doesn't fail to supply this. I saw it coming from five miles off, but yet I was happy when it did.It's a great film which I would well recommend seeing.",Nanny McPhee
119,yeojennifer,brilliant,8,7 June 2006,"Absolutely brilliant. It's the Von Trapp family meets Mary Poppins. The kids were wonderful and played their parts very well. The boy from 'Love Actually' is just fantastic.Colin Firth was at his best portraying the rather lost and muddled man that he has perfected in movies such as 'Love Actually', Bridget Jones's Diary'. Emma Thompson has created a wonderful screenplay, having never read the book(s) I am not sure how close to the story she came. She is amazing as the infamous 'Nanny' and pulls it off with aplomb. She is a very talented actor and writer. The story follows the trials of Colin Firth's character trying to find a Nanny for his seven children (he even seems a little confused as to how he has so many), after the demise of his wife - which is never really explained in the movie. The children have very active imaginations and have read way too many children's books so therefore are very familiar with the 'step-monster' syndrome. Their father has really no idea who they are as he has always worked and left the child rearing to his late wife. It is a lovely story about hope, family and why you should tell your children what is going on in your life.",Nanny McPhee
120,WyllyWylly,Meets the hype!,8,22 January 2006,"Nanny McPhee: a new movie based on an old formula. Chances of enjoyment are high - don't be put off in advance the negative comments on the boards. I've seen many threads here in the IMDb trashing this, but a great many of the critics are uninformed. I hadn't heard of the movie until I was asked to work at the screening, and I wasn't sure if I was going to stay. I can say now that I have no regrets about staying to watch and would do it again without a second thought. The cinematography and acting are top shelf as is everything else about the production.Emma Thompson portrays her character very well and is believable as ""the ugly nanny."" Her unflappable attitude towards the insanity of the children she is charged with keeping is admirable - and every parent will be wishing for one of those magic walking sticks after seeing this. Colin Firth proves his mettle as the father, doing what he thinks is best by his children even if it is somewhat misguided. The kids at the screening were also enthusiastically enjoying the film, because they can relate to it.There are many subtle things in the film that make it appropriate for all ages. For one, there are actors and actresses of all ages, and there are family friendly and age appropriate jokes and stunts for everyone too. Angela Lansbury is positively hilarious as the near-blind auntie who can't let go of her strict upper-class views. Although I think of this more as a family film than strictly a children's tale, it's easily one of the best options this season for an entertaining evening.",Nanny McPhee
121,MJPandDAS,"Holy Cow, Did I love this movie (but what was up with the colors?)",8,29 January 2006,"I loved what this movie said about parents sharing with their child, and the hurt of loss from a child's and a parent's standpoint. Every member of the family suffered greatly the loss of the the mother/wife, an dhow they dealt with it was so real. I ultimately figured the era was 1850s, but Good Lord what was with the color (I'm sorry, I meant to said colour). The evolution of Nanny MacPhee's look was cute, but I thought it should have been more understated. The evolution of Evangeline's look was wonderful. If you have children, see this movie, if you've suffered loss in your life, see this movie. If your nieces and nephews are incredibly rude, you should take them to this movie.The notion that BIG MAMA'S HOUSE 2 should take in more money this weekend is insane, and proof positive that the Hollywood's ability to determine on a Saturday night how much money a movie has made for the entire weekend is faulty (at the least).",Nanny McPhee
122,Glory_Dawn_Vaughn,I want Nanny Mcphee to be my Nanny,10,28 January 2006,"When I first went into the theater, I saw there were mostly children and a few adults so I at first thought ""Oh no it's going to be just for little kids"". I was very surprised...it's a movie for all ages(I'm 27 by the way). The special effects are excellent and the movie is just very sweet and makes you feel good. I left the theater feeling very youthful(it's amazing how you can feel like a little child when you see a fun movie). Also, the movie has adorable animals(dogs, barn animals) as well in the movie...they are these 2 sweet Basset Hounds...they looked just like my ""Louie"". I want to see this movie again because it was just wonderful.",Nanny McPhee
123,ldickinson-1,Great Movie--Take your kids,10,3 April 2006,"I would not put this movie in the category of blockbuster, but still, the first time I saw Nanny McPhee was in a packed theater with an audience that was really reacting to the movie. At the end, no one got up to leave, but just sat in their seats through the credits clapping, cheering, and shouting for an encore. I then took my grandkids to see it, and then even talked some of my adult and teenage kids into going. Again, the audience reaction was much the same, with the audience staying through the credits. I will admit that one of my sons refused to go saying he could not stand to look at someone that ugly for an hour and a half. However, I believe you will come to agree with the tag line, ""You'll learn to love Nany McPhee warts and all.""",Nanny McPhee
124,poglatg,An incredibly strong child cast leads a very nice film.,7,3 October 2018,"With so many kids in the script, this was always going to be a difficult film to cast and shoot.My goodness the kids were amazing. A competent to the point of being good script, a highly stylised colour pallate and cinematography, and a cast of well seasoned actors all helped, sure. Making light of Emma Thompson's writing and acting, Angela Lansbury's acting chops is no small feat.Great cast,well shot, all makes a very good film",Nanny McPhee
125,sdhardin,One of the best children's movies ever made!,10,10 November 2007,"I can't imagine how someone could not love this movie. The performances are excellent and the costumes and sets are fanciful and somewhat outrageous (in a good way). The first time I saw it I didn't know that Emma Thompson played the title role, and without knowing you wouldn't recognize her...at first. Colin Firth is wonderful as the haggard widower and father of seven mischievous children who have run off nanny after nanny. Angela Lansbury turns in yet another fine performance as Aunt Adelaide, an intolerant snob who wishes to force Colin Firth's character to marry by a deadline or lose funding from her that he desperately needs. How Nanny McPhee works her magic on the children is the best part. Like Mary Poppins minus the music, this is a great movie.",Nanny McPhee
126,ginmoses,"okay, but is it necessary to include a reference to incest?",5,22 February 2006,"I don't know if my comment contains a spoiler or not, but I know that the enjoyment of this sometimes excellent, sometimes boring film was impacted negatively for me by the inclusion of a reference to incest. There was no such incest, of course, but a comedy reference was made to it nevertheless. That is not a word that I would relish defining for my 5 year old niece, nor would most people. There were some hilarious performances. I especially enjoyed Angela Lansbury hamming it up. The children were excellent, too. And Colin Firth is always eye candy. His relationship with Evangeline, however, was not sufficiently developed. After all, the youngest child was still very young, so how long could the mother/wife have been dead? Not long enough for a deep love to have developed, I think. Minor roles, most notably Derek Jacobi, were well done. I give it a 5 out of 10 points.",Nanny McPhee
127,engmsek,Really it's a great family movie,10,22 August 2021,"It was really long time since I watched a family movie like Nanny McPhee, all of my family love it.I watched the movie with my wife and 3 kids ( 9, 8 and 6) really we spent a great family night.I advice this movie fir all families.",Nanny McPhee

If you aren't into fairy tales, aren't into soppy endings, aren't into simple plots that don't need the help of a computer every second or two, and if you aren't into wonderful family films, well .. you'll hate this film. Loved Emma Thompson, pulled off the Nanny with ease, Colin was as ever brilliant. Kelly Mcdonald as Evangelene is the Princess who gets her prince, and stunning she is too.Can't see this film being the biggest box office hit of all time, but I can see it becoming a Christmas favourite with the kids.",Nanny McPhee
129,brotherfallout,"Perfect for kids, plenty of fun for the adults",8,9 October 2005,"Seven children, seventeen nannies. Poor dad Cedric Brown (Colin Firth) has all but given up. Suddenly, enter Nanny McPhee (Emma Thompson) using her magical powers (both emotionally and literally) to kick them into shape. Remind you of something? I'd be concerned if it didn't. But thankfully, as Nanny McPhee progresses, it twists and turns in such a pleasant fashion that by the end, you'll be wondering 'Mary who?' Adapted for the screen by Thompson herself, this is a fun and inventive kids film that is guaranteed to make you smile. Firth does his usually stuttering British man shtick, but given he has little to do, makes the most of it. Imedla Staunton, Angela Lansbury and Celia Imrie ham it up shamelessly and are loads of fun. But most of the attention should be directed towards Thompson, an ugly but constantly entertaining lead.The art direction, visual effects and Patrick Doyle's fabulous score all soar in a confident over-the-top direction, as is the tone of the film. The score, by-the-books though it may be, is perfect and bodes well for Doyle's work on the new Harry Potter movie.Rather than basing its entirety on the naughty kids storyline, McPhee jumps from plot point to plot point, stuffing a whole lotta characters and twists into it's 97 minute running time. Thanks to this, Thompson's endearing loveliness and a cute array of kids (lead by Thomas Sangster, the kid from Love Actually), Nanny McPhee emerges triumphant as one of the better kids movies in recent memory, mostly because the adults will love it too. And anyone who isn't enchanted by the magical ending has to have a stone for a heart.",Nanny McPhee
130,Galadriel083,"A very nice, entertaining movie...",8,23 February 2006,"Emma Thompson is the best... ever!!! I thought it would be cheesy, or silly when I watched the trailer... but I was surprised, in a very very good way! It was funny, and beautiful, and we laughed like the children around us... Emma Thompson is amazing, and so is Colin Firth, perfect, as always... The children are great, with a special mention to Thomas Sangster, who is sensitive, and will become a great actor! Kelly McDonald is very pretty and acts with a lot of reserve, it's sad we don't see her that much! The Aunt, played by Angela Lansbury is scary for good, and it was nice to see her again! The story, even if it's classical, is a cute fairy tale, like those I used to read when I was younger, with the lovely happy ending... If you want to feel happy, it's a movie for you!",Nanny McPhee
131,julest1,A delight from end to end,10,5 November 2005,"We saw this as a family and every one of us enjoyed it immensely. It's intelligent, witty and great to look at, with slapstick for the children, romance, fine character acting from a top class British cast and a genuinely warm heart. A little like watching a hero myth retold, you know pretty much what's going to happen from the start, but this sense of a familiar dance well done is actually part of the charm as you settle back to enjoy the choreography and the performers' interpretations. The sets are as sound and well-chosen as the cast, and the saturated colours and vibrant costumes pay homage to the days of Technicolour. We will be buying this on DVD to watch on rainy Sunday afternoons. Strongly recommended and welcome as a new addition to the relatively small group of truly excellent films that whole families can enjoy together.",Nanny McPhee
132,audrey-53,I loved this movie,10,11 February 2006,"We just came back from seeing this movie with our 3 kids. It was awesome and not only did the kids love it, my husband did too. I loved the costumes,I am so bored of todays fashions, I love the old and uniqueness of the clothing. The sets were amazing, the colors on the walls the furniture the whole look was awesome, right down to the crumpled carpet after the kids have run through.Dirty faces and a true mess that may come from 7 children. The kids were all very cute, for a change and the baby adorable makes you want to hold and hug them all dirty faces and all!Of course Colin Firth is always excellent! Excellent movie I recommend. We will buy it as soon as it comes out!",Nanny McPhee
133,loewenfamily,Great Family Fun,9,30 January 2006,"This is an excellent family film with very little violence and questionable language. Our kids loved the film... and we did as well. Emma Thompson does a splendid job with giving depth to a character as Nanny McPhee. This movie could have gone wrong, but instead the movie was fun, with high energy and leaves you with a great moral lesson (especially to kids). Also, good to see a movie set in England with all English actors. The movie has the same feel as Mary Poppins, but with cinematography that matches todays standards. It is definitely worth to see in theatres. Word of advise: The fathers occupation in the film is a mortician. If your child is very sensitive to death I would recommend them not to see this film.",Nanny McPhee
134,agnesnitt-1,Fun for kids and adults,8,28 January 2006,"At the end of this movie I heard something I haven't heard in a movie theater in 20 years- applause. The full theater was an audience of families (with over half children under 10) were absolutely focused on the movie. No crying children, no talking, not one ringing cell phone, no coughing (always a dead giveaway of boredom). Each child of 10 and under will have a child in the family they can identify with (boy or girl), so no one feels left out. Adults will just enjoy the film.This is obviously a fantasy: magical powers, time and space transcended, and not historically correct. Although it takes place in a Victorian like England, it's obvious to the adult viewer that this is an England that never was (for example the wealthy aunt's footman is Asian, the costumes are not perfectly period correct, and the female cook had been in the Army).Strange as it may seem, this movie deals delicately with the death of the mother yet uses dead bodies for amusement. The opening scene where you see her empty chair with a brief narration, respectfully sets the scene so that all but the youngest child can feel the loss, without having the fact blatantly spelled out. Later in the film we discover the father is a mortician, and we see several dead bodies laid out in his mortuary. This is used for comic effect. Only the English can pull this off without being offensive. Derek Jacobi has a small part that is wonderfully funny. He and Patrick Barlow (another distinguished British actor not well known in the US) do a few scenes that reminded me very much of Ken Williams and Hugh Paddick playing Julian and Sandy--and just as funny.",Nanny McPhee
135,cmfaraday,"Absolutely Love ""Nanny McPhee""",10,30 January 2006,"I could recommend this movie to almost anyone, except those who's favorite type of movie is a car-chasing shoot 'em up. Kids will love the animals and antics of the Brown children. Parents will love the underlying message. Emma Thompson and Colin Firth are wonderful to watch (big fan of both), Angela Lansbury is cartoonishly funny/scary, and the rest of the cast are flawless (hats off to Derek Jacobi - nice to see him post-Cadfael). The ending was so beautiful I was tearing up.Great story and nice theme. Overall the movie reminded me of Babe. The ending had the feel of Edward Scissorhand.Worth seeing over and over again, as well as buying when it comes out. Tell your friends and family to go see this movie!",Nanny McPhee
136,KennaS,What a lovely film,10,23 March 2008,"Nanny McPhee was by far one of the most moving, beautifully written, and acted movies I have ever had the privilege to see. Emma Thompson is in a class of her own and has done a beautiful job bringing Christianna Brand's lesson for children that now cleverly disguise itself as a beautiful film. The precocious children chosen for the rolls have bright futures ahead. And as always, Angela Lansbury does a superb job delivering roles that to anyone else would be stiff and extremely overacted. Emma and Angela both have a talent for making the difficult seem supremely easy.Bright bold colors and magical antics capture hand hold the child's attention while teaching your child that all actions have consequences that must be dealt with. Perhaps some adults will learn a lesson as well?",Nanny McPhee
137,Norma_Snockers,She did knock ... and we were knocked-out!,9,28 October 2005,"An excellent film. I took my little lad to see this as it was half-term - and we both had a knock-out time. There were people in the audience who hadn't brought children with them, and they laughed louder than most, which proves that the film stands up in its own right - not just as a kids film. Emma Thompson gave a wonderful, under-stated performance - showing what true professionals are made of.I had thought that the film may be a bit like Mary Poppins - but my fears were quickly alleviated. As someone has already pointed out, the only similarity is that the film is about a nanny. This one just happens to be funny. OK - she don't sing but I can live with that.Not going to give anything away at all ... just watch it ... you won't be disappointed!",Nanny McPhee

The staging and vivid colours used were absolutely perfect and each set was full of things to catch your eye.I've always liked Emma Thompson, but not in a 'big fan' kind of way, but I must say she gave one of the most understated, beautifully controlled performances, and her wonderful character was magically endearing within moments of her arrival on the scene.I thought hard before giving a rating for this film, but couldn't find one thing to stop it from being absolutely perfect.",Nanny McPhee

I am saved from that dark opinion by this absolutely lovely little movie. Great story, marvelous set direction, beautiful acting (especially from the children), Emma Thompson and Colin Firth. What more could you want from a film, you ask? Why how about Angela Lansbury and Derek Jacobi! And if that is not enough to get you into the theater how about a donkey in a flowered hat?? It's funny. It's sweet. It's tender. It's beautifully written and directed. The whole family absolutely loved it. We plan to see it again. See it with any and every child you know. See it if you don't know any children. Be prepared to be delighted.",Nanny McPhee

I only went because my mates wanted to go, and after thinking long and hard about it I decided to go because I just wanted to get out of the house (thank God it was only a Sunday night). I thought to myself 'Maybe it's not that bad', by God was I wrong. Now I realize I am a 16 year old male but hey, I can still enjoy kid movies. The film was boring, very very predictable, corny and just so... all been done before. It was boring to see the movie stay in the same place the whole time, never leaving the house. It went very slowly and I felt like leaping over the banister I was sat by and killing myself. The kids were so annoying I wanted to kill them all, especially that one from that Love Actually. Colin Firth was just, ugh, is character was pathetic - I couldn't;t look at him. Every scene was predictable and the end... oh my god, the end. Could it have been more corny and predictable? The answer to that question is NO. That made me cringe so much that I actually had to get up and leave before the credits started rolling. This is not an ""enchanting, magical"" movie, it is more like a ""boring, ALL BEEN DONE BEFORE"" movie.",Nanny McPhee
141,pippajulian,Magic AND Slapstick - what more could the kids want?,7,28 October 2005,"My 9 year old niece giggled a lot of the way through this film, especially when the children said some ""unmentionable"" words out loud! But it had a moral message too (well enough hidden not to be didactic). Emma Thompson was virtually unrecognisable as the hideous Nanny McPhee, and her reactions (or lack of them) to the children's bad behaviour was beautifully serene. You could tell that she had the respect of the children in the audience, as well as her charges in the film. Of course we all knew (us adults at least) that it would all end happily ever after, but not before all the baddies had a good dose of custard pies and justice. A real ""feel good"" movie without being too treacly.",Nanny McPhee

The Brown children are very naughty and very disobedient and Mr. Brown (Colin Firth) is looking for another nanny after the children had chased away 17 nannies. An eerie message comes for Mr. Brown everywhere saying ""The person you need is Nanny McPhee!"" Nanny McPhee (Emma Thompson) arrives at the Brown door and takes everybody through an entire adventure. The children must learn five lessons: 1) Go to bed when you're told 2) Get up when you're told 3) Can't remember 4) Can't remember 5) Do as you're told Overall, if you got kids, take them to this movie.

It was annoying and I am usually easy to please when it comes to movies, especially those for children which are usually enjoyable and with a moral purpose. The only moral of this movie is to behave and be good only if you are afraid of somebody and that without the witchcraft nanny McPee wouldn't have been able to make the children listen. The movie does not appeal to feelings and reason, it teaches children that unless their parents don't use magic, they are useless and boring. Emma Thompson's character is not even likable at the end and the solution to the father's problem is purely disgusting. Too bad for Angela Lansbury who is an extraordinary actress and who plays a good role(probably the only realistic role in this movie).Anyway I do not recommend this thing to anybody.",Nanny McPhee

I also applaud the movie for expressing the idea that parents should communicate to their children as people, rather than leaving them totally in the dark.When disaster is imminent, the kids have to put on their thinking caps and come up with creative solutions. Although it is rather fanciful, the lesson is that young people are important and can make a difference, no matter how small they are.Quite apart from the above, I enjoyed the movie for its visual artistry and comedy.",Nanny McPhee

This movie is terrific! You'd think after watching it over and over you'd tire of it, but that is the farthest thing from the truth. The cast of this movie is perfect. Emma Thompson is tremendous, Colin Firth is amazing and so adorable playing this father of 7 crazy kids. The children are perfect little actors...everyone in the cast is perfect!

You will probably think ""Oh it looks stupid and corny."" But I was surprised to see it is a cute comedy. It had some laughs and little kids will love it. But adults probably wont think much of it. But I have to say that there was some innopriate comment at the part where the dad meets with Ms. Quickly to ask if she will be his wife. And for the people who say the ending is corny I think that the movie makers were trying to catch your imagination. I thought the ending was really cute and sweet. I think little children will enjoy it.",Nanny McPhee

Colin firth did a great job as Mr. Brown. Emma Thompson acted amazingly. Not afraid to play the ugly character. The music was great, the makeup and costumes were spectacular. Special effects were fantastic. It was hilarious! A must see. It used the Mary Poppins archetype but was in it's own way, very different. The naughtiness displayed by the children was immense fun. Nanny McPhee is a movie you watch a hundred times and never get sick of. There is an underlying theme on perception.

I went to the theatre with the intent of watching a comedic family film, but I received so much more.This film promotes manners and morals that should be taught not just to children but to their parents as well. Viewers of all ages can benefit from this entertaining, thought-provoking film that inspires the well behaved child in us all.Made up clever comedy, a fantastic screenplay, incredible acting, and don't forget: ""please"" and ""thank you"", this movie is a must-see for anyone who's ever been a little naughty.",Nanny McPhee

My girls are 8 and 12 and they were positively glued to the screen. I thought it a wonderful story and a great production too. The girls made me promise to buy the DVD when it comes out and we went straight to the book store to get the stories of Nurse Matilda that the movie was based on. Now, here is where the academy award comes in. I don't have the categories memorized but the team that was able to make such a wonderful screenplay out of such a lousy book surely deserves that award. It is rare when it happens but yes, the movie was a FAR sight better than the book. If you have kids or if you need to entertain your inner kid, go see this movie.",Nanny McPhee
150,texasaccountant,From a Skeptic,10,27 June 2006,"I was very skeptical of seeing this movie because I thought that it would be a knock off of Mary Poppins, which I loved as a child.I could not have been more wrong. The only things that the movies really have in common is that they are both set in England, deal with nannies and are sure to be classics.Nanny McPhee is an excellently and cleverly written movie which entertains, fascinates, teaches, moves quickly and holds your attention.I love the way that the end of the movie ties up loose ends, which proves how well written the movie truly is.The best movie that I have seen this year. Every child needs a Nanny McPhee if only for a little while.",Nanny McPhee
151,solomon-nancy,"Terrific movie, a must see!! Beautiful film.",10,4 April 2006,I absolutely loved this movie. It has all the excitement and surprise of Mary Poppins without the sugar coating. Emma Thompson is wonderful and the children are all adorable. Colin Firth is terrific! What a treat to see him smile! In Pride and Prejudice he was forced to scowl most of the time and his beautiful smile was only seen at the very end of the movie. What a treat to see him smile in Nanny M. His whole face lights up! The ending is enchantingly beautiful. I almost missed this one and am delighted that I had a chance to see it. It will easily become a must-have video and I'm glad my family didn't miss this terrific film. Absolutely lovely!,Nanny McPhee
152,molsen90,Definitely a hit for all!,8,23 October 2005,"Wasn't quite sure what to expect, had heard it was to be compared with Mary Poppins, a film I happen to dislike intently! However, I thoroughly enjoyed it from the moment it began to the credits at the end. I could see no link to MP other than it was about a nanny.The quirky setting was ideal with the house dilapidate in a jolly kind of way, so often I find this quite a depressing area.Derek Jacobi and his side kick added a delightfully gay humour aspect.Imelda Staunton as usual was brilliant, the kids were cute (no little brat as is normal in these types of films) Emma Thompson was definitely a star in an understated way! All in all a fantastic film for everyone!",Nanny McPhee
153,taily123,Much better than i expected,8,20 February 2006,"I wasn't too keen on seeing this because i thought it would be a very kid movie, but i'm glad i did. The actors are good, especially Thomas Sangster (Simon). I just loved him! Emma Thompson can change the slightest turning of her head and a mumbled 'hm' into so many things. It is a very cute story, heartwarming sometimes, thought-provoking other times, and funny the rest of the time. The special effects, i think, were perfect. Just enough to show that it was magic, but it wasn't over done, as in some other 'magical' movies.The only thing i did not like about the movie was the fact that the ending was pretty obvious, but it is very hard to make a fairy tale with a twist ending. We never do find out anything about Nanny McPhee, which is sort of the point, i think. She is just THERE. Doesn't matter why or how. The movie isn't about HER as the person - its about what she brings about.I definitely recommend seeing this movie, no matter how old you are.",Nanny McPhee

My Children do not sit for anything very long ,exspecially My Twins that are 5. They along with the others sat thru the whole Movie. My Husband and I were amazed by that! We also enjoyed the Movie as Much as they did, and We thought of My Brothers 7 Children that are even worse than the Children that are in the Movie. His Children needed Nanny McPhee !!more than the Children here. We saw this Movie as a Great Family Movie and a teaching one at that. We would see it again anytime.Our Family would recommend this to anyone at any age young and old alike.The time, place and all actions in the Movie were set as a Great timing. the Events were great as they showed greatness to the Movie ,like it just fell into place. We would love to see a Nanny McPhee 2 come to theaters some day soon.",Nanny McPhee
155,dr_nazz,An Utterly Charming Tale,10,30 October 2006,"Nanny Mcphee is a charming Tale about a Mysterious Nanny who comes to the aid of the Brown Household to help discipline the children and teach them how to be a family again. Although a cliché in terms of plot, the movie is very well acted and the storyline is anything but conventional. Just the right amount of special effects that keeps the realism of the movie, it is scripted very well indeed, and the performances of the cast are spot on. Full of Magic and Utterly charming the film is a triumph. Emma Thompson is fantastic as the strange Nanny, her ability to create an endearing quality to the harsh faced nanny is amazing and her talent to convey emotion from a single look will leave most viewers captured. As for the Children they are adorable. Colin Firth also gives a fantastic performance as the disillusioned father. The story is so well acted and with a combination of a heartwarming soundtrack, charming characters and a dash of magic this film is enchanting. I dare anyone to not have tears in their eyes at the end.",Nanny McPhee
156,donna920,Excellent Movie For Every Age!,10,24 June 2006,"This was a very cute movie. It was interesting enough for adults, without being too silly, and entertaining for children. There were enough twists to keep you guessing, yet not so many that you were frustrated. Nanny Mcphee was a real delight. Despite her less than attractive appearance, her eyes showed love and concern always, and seeing the changes in everyone at each turn made you watch for more. The acting was excellent, even down to the baby. It's truly a movie worth watching again and again. In fact each time you watch it, there's something new to discover. I especially liked the messages it sends... without giving away anything, the message about stepmothers is nice to see, and most importantly the old 'Don't judge a book by it's cover'.It's nice to watch a movie without hearing profanity. I highly recommend it for everyone.",Nanny McPhee
157,mnd_mail,A Well Produced Fairy Tale,10,15 July 2006,"If you like well produced, ""feel good"", ""fairy tale"", type movies, you should be pleased with this one. The child actors and actresses do a fine job as do the major characters. Although most viewers will figure out the ending early on, it's not so obvious how the story is going to get there. There are several interesting surprises and twists along the way, and as presented in the movie, the storyline exercises enough ""poetic license"" to allow disagreement over what the story is saying about life and love. Good camera work, good sets, and very well crafted. On the other hand if you must have a lot of nature and beautiful scenery, you might want to skip this movie because most of the story takes place in man made environments. But if you enjoy a good fairy tale well told, take a chance on this one.",Nanny McPhee
158,amtrave1,The most heart warming film made in years.,10,2 September 2006,"I first will begin in saying that I certainly hope there will be a sequel or two or three. Nanny McPhee is the best film made in years. It is heart warming, entertaining throughout, full of wisdom and love. I watch it at least once a week. After working long hours, it is relaxing, witty, and a breathe of fresh air.It is my hope that Emma Johnson continues to write more screenplays as well as sequels to Nanny McPhee. You are a favorite of mine and many others, I am sure Ms. Johnson. I am not aware whether or not this movie has received the highest award but, I certainly hope so. In addition, everyone in the filem was well suited for his and her parts, did excellent work and deserved many commendations besides the highest awards. Each one who was in the fill, stand up as I applaud you. Thank you Emma Johnson and all who were in the film for blessing my life with this wonderful film. Thank you for making a difference.Best regards, Linda Raven",Nanny McPhee

160,garychollingshead,One of my favorite movies of all time,10,5 February 2007,"What a wonderful movie! I especially liked the brilliant colors and the detail in the backgrounds. Every time I watch it, I see something else. I'm not going to mention any details of the story, because nearly everything I'd mention would be a spoiler! Worth the ticket price, worth the DVD price, worth a trip to the rental shop or library. I'm nearly 60 years old and I've watched ""Nanny"" with my 20-year-old daughter and with my young grandchildren and their 30-something mother. We all enjoyed it. What I loved most was the vulnerability and strength shown simultaneously by the father, the near-total lack of snotty, know-it-all attitude among the children and the fact that all the central characters grow in understanding and love for one another. Excuse me, now; I'm going to watch it again. (Third time this week!)",Nanny McPhee
161,effi-gee,Mary Poppins without the syrup!,10,23 October 2005,"A delightful and, at times, delightfully wicked family movie that will please all ages: A treat for the whole family - literally - we went as a group aged from 7 to 80 and were all enthralled by this magical tale.The Brown household is one of chaos and disorder - seven children who delight in disposing of Nannies at an alarming rate. Enter Nanny McPhee, who dispenses lessons far more profound than her simple explanations of them would suggest and it's not just the children she needs to teach.The lively plot twists and turns, the children are engaging but never nauseating and the climax is first hilarious and then heart-warming.Among live-action children's movies this has to be one of the best I've seen in a very long time.",Nanny McPhee
162,lemonchild45,"Good for kids, but not the best.",6,13 April 2006,"I must admit that I had much higher expectations of 'Nanny McPhee' than it actually delivered. Although it's an entertaining, funny and, at times, touching movie, I felt that there was a certain something it lacked and that something was actually Nanny McPhee. Considering she's the main character, I was surprised that, by the end, the storyline of her character had all but fizzled out. The movie started great, with eye-catching sets and quick humour (and even some 'bums' to keep the kids happy), but I can only rate it with a 6 out of 10, as I was fairly disappointed at the lack of focus on Nanny McPhee's 'rules' - which seemed to be the most important part of the movie at the beginning - and couldn't help but feel that she'd been forgotten.All the same, I loved the ending, and the way that everything turns out; this movie definitely has something for everyone and, despite a certain amount of silliness, it's worth watching, especially to keep children entertained on a rainy day (but anyone who actually cares about a movie's plot and characters should probably be warned).",Nanny McPhee
163,dusya65,why i liked the film so much,10,8 December 2012,"The film should be watched twice. I' m not kidding. First time you see it you take it as a nice fairy tale sometimes funny, sometimes a little sad but still a fairy tale. After watching it for the second time I realized that it tells us very important things. The very first lesson I've learnt is how important, almost vital the role that parents play in their children's life, is. Mr.Brown was so mush absorbed by his grief that he stopped reading bed –time stories to his children, playing cricket with them, talking with Simon. That was the starting point when all the troubles with the children started. It was lesson number ONE. No matter how busy we are, what problems we have, we should always remember about our children, keep an eye on them, care for them. As soon as we stop doing that everything goes wrong. Lesson number TWO. We remember very well how Nanny McPhee looked like when she first appeared in the family: her ""potatous"" nose , the warts  But in the course of time she became nicer and nicer. It all happened because the children became better and better. At the end of the film we meet a very nice, slender woman who has nothing to do with Nanny McPhee we met in the beginning. What is the lesson? Very much in our life depends on ourselves and people around us. The worse and uglier they are the uglier we ourselves become. My conclusion? Be kind, friendly, understanding, sympathizing , and there will be no ""warts"" around you. PS. I was quite disappointed when in one of the interviews I read that Mr. C. Firth felt ashamed of his part in the film. He wouldn't like his sons to see him running, jumping and all that. What was wrong about that? It sounded to me somewhat ""snobbish"". Or I must have misunderstood what he said. Did I?",Nanny McPhee
164,laurelcrowe,A wonderful new twist on a classic tale,8,27 May 2006,"Of course, ""Nanny McPhee"" reminds us of ""Mary Poppins"", there are many parallels, but ""Nanny"" presents some new twists and a wonderful message for children today. Emma Thompson's portrayal of the homely nanny is layered with love and humor. The children must learn five important life lessons before she will leave them (and at the beginning, they really want her to go), but in the end the children realize how important a little discipline and a lot of love are. My entire family enjoyed ""Nanny McPhee"" and I love to show films to my son that help him learn positive messages, yet are filled with great humor and talent. I would recommend this movie to anyone, any age.",Nanny McPhee
165,pam-146,Perfect escapism!,9,9 October 2005,"Saw the film this morning at a Sunday Times preview and I'd like to think that more than a few of you will be eating your words when you see the finished product. It's beautifully put together, with lots of humour, the attractive Colin Firth and many superb performances. Celia Imrie creates a colourful character in Mrs Quickly, Imelda Staunton is fantastic as the cook (Mrs Blatherwick) and Angela Lansbury is expertly cast as Aunt Adelaide (despite the feathered dress making her look like a turkey!) As guessed at on another thread, Nanny McPhee does teach the children - that manners matter, you should be responsible for your actions, and that actions have consequences. It isn't dumbed down, there's certainly no 'dopey dialogue' - and there's also no annoying Americanisms as beset Charlie & the Chocolate Factory.At first glance, you could imagine Emma Thompson giving a very over the top performance, given the warts, over-sized nose and tooth. Instead she gives a careful and considered performance - everything in the right measure.Enjoy Nanny McPhee for what it is - a large dose of magical escapism with plenty of laughs for good measure. A few rude words and food fights to keep the kids (and parents) happy, oh and a dancing donkey, but overall a film that is lots of fun. Can't wait for the DVD.",Nanny McPhee

I would recommend that you should all go and see it and feel the magic for yourself. It looks fantastic and has been made with a lot of loving care and attention to detail. I cannot understand why anyone would be disappointed with this movie. Emma Thompson once again proves that she is a great actress and screen writer. I predict that the film will do very well and become a box office hit and loved by many people of all ages, hopefully around the world and not just in the U.K.",Nanny McPhee
168,kevinjh49-imdb,Great fun for the family,8,9 October 2005,"I really enjoyed this film. I am renowned for falling asleep when I take my children to the cinema, but not this time. It could be considered to be a Mary Poppins rip off, but it is substantially different. The children are delightful and it is a real feel good movie. Colin Firth is his usual self and plays a similar character to that in Bridget Jones' Diary, but it fits the bill perfectly for this film. Obviously this is a vehicle for Emma Thompson, given that she wrote the screenplay, but she plays the role of Nanny McPhee really well. The only bit of the film that I didn't like was the cake throwing at the wedding, but this is a slight blip in an otherwise enjoyable film.",Nanny McPhee
169,smsherpa,Laughed and cried but loved it,10,10 February 2006,"Whilst this movie will undoubtedly be compared to Mary Poppins because of a similar genre, I'd have to say it's only comparison would be that she's a nanny with special powers plus there's seven children here, not two.There's the usual 'pranks' that the children get up to plus the wedding scene towards the end is really something to see. There's something about food fights that always amuses.Very entertaining and whilst somewhat predictable I found it very funny and yes, even needed the tissues in the odd section or two.Light hearted and very easy to watch and I'd definitely see it again.",Nanny McPhee
170,melanie-kendall,Me and the kids loved it - when is the DVD out?!?,10,23 October 2005,"This film was Mary Poppins meets the Sound of Music meets Harry Potter - magical, funny, hilarious, sad, dark, every adjective you could think of describes it in some part of the film. Colin Firth, whom I don't really like but was good in Love Actually, was excellent as the widowed father, along with LA's Thomas Sangster as his oldest son. The talking baby was a little surreal, but always appropriate with its remarks, and i can't help thinking the donkey was nicked from Shrek! We all loved it. Just by the cast list I had a funny feeling that this was a Working Title production, and it lived up to all expectations from a great production team, as I haven't seen one bad film made by them. Congratulations on a fantastic all-round film!!",Nanny McPhee

And as for Nanny McFhee is concerned, the directer needs a new joke book.",Nanny McPhee
172,morrisuk,Best of British- and not just for children!,9,31 October 2005,"A most excellent British film. In an industry dominated by the formulated churnings of American studios, this film celebrated what the British do best. The characters rise above adversity without melodramatic bleating. I took my children to see the film over the half term break. Quite frankly I was expecting a re-hash of Mary Poppins but Emma Thompson who wrote the screenplay and starred in the title role soon puts any preconceptions of spoon-fulls of sugar to rest. The work nods to Lemony Snicket in regards to being almost too dark for a children's film. Without giving too much away, two days after seeing it I am still debating with my wife whether Nanny McPhee was a witch or an angel. Regardless, the result was an uplifting but not sugary-sweet experience which did not treat children as mindless robots but complimented the audience on its intelligence. It explores the nature of child-adult relationships, parenting and even class-struggle. Plus- how refreshing to watch a film without a single American accent!",Nanny McPhee
173,gary-681,Closing Credits?,6,17 February 2006,"Does anyone know who/what company did the closing credits for Nanny McPhee? I liked them...worth staying for.

The credits here are not quite as good or as long, however.The child in me enjoyed the movie. It's fun and made me laugh a lot. That's worth it. It's not a classic, but worth seeing.Emma did a good job! I think it will be better for children, than adults. There is not much new or extremely cleaver about the film.

Few movies satisfy all my family, yet this one struck all of us with its storyline (a stellar adaptation), atmosphere and talented cast. We all were at the end of our seats through the film, excited to see what was going to happen. Rarely does a movie capture all of us, as this one did. We are counting down the days until we can purchase the DVD and add it to our library.In my opinion the distributor did the public and the movie a disservice by not promoting this film more. This lack of confidence gave me an indication to wait and rent. Maybe interviewing the children on Nickolodeon, having them show up at the Cartoon Network studios, something like this would have gotten more word out. Also, someone PLEASE interview Emma Thompson!!! This woman, aside from being a consummate actor, has continued to astound with her amazing screenplays! Had the studio looked more confident regarding this movie, I predict it would have done much better at the box office.My family consider this movie a true Gift.",Nanny McPhee

Will certainly look forward to when it comes out on DVD. I went to the theatre with 3 generations of us in attendance, we all came away from it with a good feeling of being very entertained. In particular found the donkey to be very funny, wish we had seen more of her. Hope more movies of this caliber are in the works, being from England, this type of work is what we do best. This was certainly a movie for all ages to enjoy, all the cast was extremely talented in their respective roles. One of the few movies I have seen in a long time where you do not want it to end.

But, in a most ""Mary Poppins"" fashion she teaches the lesson that children need their parents.At the beginning we are told ""There is something you must understand about the way I work: When you do not want me, but need me, I will be here. When you want me, but do not need me, then I must leave."" At the end...we understand why.Thank you Emma Thompson, for a movie that is sure to last as long as we need Nanny McPhee.",Nanny McPhee

While this picture isn't in a genre that has current favor among young males, views who are willing to give into the premise will be well rewarded. A film with both humor and heart in a smartly written story by Ms. Thompson, this is a film far better in many ways than its predecessor, Mary Poppins. For one thing, the film does not edge away from the horror of mean children, nor the fun of it all. Really a film to see now and treasure in the future. The cast couldn't be better. Colin Firth proves that he is the finest leading man working now, Emma Thompson is in another of her mystery costume roles which keep getter better with each permutation, and Ms. MacDonald is quietly yummy. Watch for Angela Landsbury, in a scene stealing role ala Judi Dench.",Nanny McPhee
178,pillowtalk,Fabulous! Charming literature captured on film!,10,2 February 2006,"Firth, Thompson, Staunton, and the impeccable Lansbury, give such fine quality to this fabulous movie. The children's pranks and antics were superbly performed and each ""extreme"" character was utterly delightful. The casting was perfect. In this heartwarming story one can appreciate how truly paramount ""Nannys"" become to children. Robert Louis Stevenson adored his Nanny (Nurse)so much that he considered her to be his first wife , and we can enjoy this Nanny thoroughly. I laughed, I wept, and then giggled some more. Truly charming! My eight children will consider this to be a family favorite. Thank you, Emma!!I hope to see much more from you.",Nanny McPhee

My children and I loved watching it together. It's nice to have a movie finally come out that everyone can enjoy. I highly recommend seeing it. Emma Thompson is so endearing. Colin Firth is such a lost soul trying to avoid everything and everyone around him. Angela Landsbury is so over the top, but very funny. Together they make such an interesting trio. The love, the comedy, the magic, and the unbelievable happy ending make it more than just a fairy tale, they make it a story that makes you wish that it was all happening to you. For children, it sets their minds imaginations into over-drive. It sends them to a place that lets their minds run free to believe in everything on the big screen in front of them. For just an adult, I would say, it would be less special, as apposed to an adult who has children to watch get engaged with this magical movie.",Nanny McPhee

The children are endearing and the oldest boy was wonderful. It was great to see Angela Lansbury also - she was so good years ago in Bedknobs and Broomsticks.

But this, Nanny McPhee, made me think differently. Emma Thompson is a wondrously talented woman and she proved it here again (along with Colin Firth, of course!) as she helped the distinctly intelligent yet naive Brown children turn their behaviours to the good. I saw several older ladies cry and many young children cheer throughout this extremely well done movie. Mary Poppins, watch out! This Nanny has got a few up on you! I implore all who are considering taking their child(ren) to this film to do so! It has many values that are lacking in films today. This movie might even make a child rethink his or her attitude towards their nannies! This is a movie we desperately needed! Good Show, Emma!",Nanny McPhee
182,onekewlpenguin,Wonderful movie!,8,28 January 2006,"I went to see this movie today and i loved it. Though many people may criticize this movie, it is definitely worth the price of the movie ticket. The beginning of the movie has some slightly lame lines, such as ""I would like some toast and jam! OK, hold the jam!"" but besides that it is wonderful! I strongly suggest this movie for young children as it received many laughs from people of this age group. Older kids and adults would get enjoyment out of this movie as well.This movie contains very good morals and a wonderful storyline about a father who needs money to support his seven kids. He receives a monthly allowance from his aunt who made a deal with him that he needs to get married within a month in order to continue receiving money. Her reasons for this is that the father's seven kids are very naughty and in need of a mother of some kind.

The gorgeous Colin Firth aside, I thought everything from elaborate makeup and costumes, to the hilarious happenings of the bratty, yet sweet Brown family was very well done! Bravo! I must say Colin Firth made this film extremely enjoyable, and those who say he is getting old are just plain ridiculous! This has to be the first Colin movie I was able to watch with my little siblings! There was very little sexual innuendo throughout the movie, and it was subtle. Emma Thompson is a genius, makes a wonderful screenplay, and an even better Nanny! The only flaw of this film was that it wasn't entirely original. The large sum of bratty children tamed by their nanny: Von Trapp family. The magical nanny who comes from out of no where: Mary Poppins. But it was still delightful in every way!",Nanny McPhee

The character portrayed by Emma Thompson was simply wonderful. Even though she used her ""magic"" to get desired results from the children, all one had to do was look into her eyes and see the genuine compassion she felt for the children. The whole scenario with the fairy tale books and logic behind WHY the children misbehaved to much made them not nearly as bratty as one would have expected from such behavior and actually made me feel a bit sorry for them so they became almost likable in their attitudes. They weren't just ""brats"" for the sake of being brats; they had a genuine fear of losing their father which, ultimately would have happened had he married that harpie Mrs. Quimby.My children absolutely loved the whole barnyard animal scene, especially the dancing donkey. Second to that was the food fight at the wedding. I found this movie to be appropriate for children of ALL ages and simply enjoyable for myself as well.

It was clever and never ""dumbed down"" as some movies peddled as family fare are these days. This film was both funny and touching. The scenery and costumes were also wonderful to look at -lovely use of color. Some reviews have said that the movie tries too hard to appeal to adults, but I disagree. If preschoolers can enjoy it, most children will. I highly recommend it to audiences of all ages.",Nanny McPhee

It's funny, has great characters and teaches a really good lesson - what is not to like? Emma Thompson does an incredible job portraying Nanny, bulbous nose, warts, univ-brow and all! In fact, all the characters in the film look exactly like you'd imagine they would if you were reading the book instead of seeing the movie. The young girl who plays Evangeline is great, I don't recall ever seeing her before. She adds a very sweet touch to the film.

Like the yucky medicine she delivers to the malingering children, the trailer looks questionable, but the movie delivers lots of healthy stuff. First, the lessons learned by the children are ones that viewers of all age could benefit from reviewing. Emma Thompson gives a perfectly understated performance in that over-the-top garb. Colin Firth is exactly cast as a father who, beset by worldly woes, tries to solve them alone without involving his children in their real world. The production itself is a blast of color and froth to rival the second half of The Wizard of Oz. It's one of those unique films that is simultaneously pure fairy tale fantasy and honest truth.

When the lady in question (played by Emma Thompson) arrives on his doorstep when he, the scullery maid and the cook are knee deep in mayhem, the frazzled father quickly hires wart-marked and toothy Nanny McPhee, and boy does that magical woman mean business!I loved this film. Colin Firth is wonderful as a frustrated father having to contemplate an unwanted marriage to save his family from the poor house, keep his funeral parlor afloat, discipline his children and acknowledge his growing love for someone ""so obviously beneath him."" I've been a Firth fan since the old BBC version of ""Pride & Prejudice,"" and thus far, he hasn't hit bellow his mark. Emma Thompson...what can I say? She's a genius. Every role she's played is pulled off masterfully, and Nanny McPhee was right on par. Not many women take on roles that portray them in a less that beautiful light, but with Thompson's superior acting ability, Nanny McPhee's inner beauty shine through her not-so- pretty facade.Great film! Go see it!",Nanny McPhee
189,mitchmovmem,pleasant but offensive,6,11 February 2006,This was a very delightful movie with humor but also a much needed message for kids to obey and parents to set rules plus show love for them. The flatulence parts were offensive and makes kids think it's OK to be vulgar. The most offensive part that ruined the movie for us was the busty cleavage on the potential bride. Not only was such fashion nonexistent in that time period but it embarrassed the girls and us as well. It was put in there to degrade us women and treat us as sex objects which every movie and TV show now does. If the fiancé were dressed properly and the flatulence omitted it would have been a very enjoyable movie with a positive message. I would not bring a child to this and girls would be embarrassed especially around boys and fathers. Nor should adults see it if they respect women.,Nanny McPhee
190,diamond514,This is a must see movie,10,17 February 2006,"This was one of the best films I have seen in quite some time.It was very easy to get caught up in the story.The children captured my heart,even though at times they were dreadful little monsters. Emma Thompson was magnificent as the loving and caring Nanny McPhee.The story,the casting,and the writing,all came together to make this a perfectly enchanting film.Every actor/actress brought something wonderful,that made them more than just two dimensional characters pulled from the pages of a book. If you haven't seen it yet,I recommend that you do.Even if you don't have a child to share this movie with, you will enjoy the very endearing Nanny McPhee(warts and all).",Nanny McPhee
191,whatdahellhappened,Great family movie,7,17 February 2006,"This movie is very similar to Mary Poppins, but with a crude twist - the nanny is not a looker. No disappointing acting performances, although one of the children looked like she came from a different family all together. Either she got her features from a gene that was passed down from long ago, or the former wife has a lot of explaining to do. I guess the casting agent was asleep or just attempting to be fired so he/she could collect the unemployment and eat govt. cheese.There wasn't anything offensive that I recall. There is a little ""gross"" humor, but the reaction of the audience was very positive. Regardless, the movie is fun and keeps your attention well. My kids loved it.",Nanny McPhee
192,FireAngel2,Ugh no.....,2,21 February 2006,"I did not like this movie. I mean, it was so predictable. I just knew the guy (I forgot his name, so in this review he will be known as ""the dude"") wasn't going to marry Mrs Quickly, and two minutes into the movie I knew there was love between Evangeline and the dude and they were going to get married. And then the snow turned Evangeline's dress into a totally different wedding gown. What was up with that? And the way the mothers rattle just fell from the sky...it was just so fantasy-fluffy-fairy tale. You know, just too cotton candy. Half the time I was like ""huh?!?"", and the other half I was rolling my eyes at how corny it was. The whole thing was just kinda cheesy.",Nanny McPhee
193,nicoledeckerroy,Nanny McPhee,10,24 February 2006,"I took my girls, 7 and 5 to see this movie because it was the only kid movie that wasn't a cartoon. I had seen the trailer for it during Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and thought it looked very good. Well this is the first time that the best parts of a movie are not in the trailer. What an exceptional movie! I would of watched the movie right away again if I had been able too. Emma Thomson did a remarkable job. This was a movie that kids as well as parents can enjoy, an excellent feel good movie! The movie shows that you can still make good quality entertaining family movies! I will be the first in line to purchase the DVD!",Nanny McPhee
194,mpatient24,What a great entertaining movie for all ages.,10,7 March 2006,"I never read the books that this movie is based on, but it did remind me a bit of Ms. Piggle Wiggle, and Mary Poppins. I'm 25, and my fiancé is 31. Yes, I did drag him to see it, but he admittedly enjoyed it. Just a very sweet, feel good kind of movie. I loved the way Nanny McPhee got prettier and even younger looking as the children got more more behaved. It's like she started out as ugly on the outside as the children's behavior was. I laughed a lot and the end gave me goose bumps. I don't want to have 7 children, but wouldn't it be nice for everybody if there really was a Nanny McPhee for those in need. I highly recommend this movie. Especially for those with kids.",Nanny McPhee
195,choaping,Fatastic Movie,9,23 March 2006,"Really well produced children movie of the year! I didn't pay much attention to it when i watched the trailer but when i watched it, it was beyond what i imagined it! Highly recommended movie for the family! Every minute of the movie captured me. Not a part of it was boring! Especially the unforgettable Nanny MsPhee's ""hmm"". And also the line ""when u need me but do not want me, then i will stay. when u want me but do need me, then i will have to go"". The cast were well chosen, especially the kids and the baby. A very heart warming movie that will make u laugh and cry. It is a must see movie of the year!(two thumbs up)great movie.",Nanny McPhee
