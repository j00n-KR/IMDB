0,TheLittleSongbird,Death returns with a vengeance,7,1 December 2017,"While it was not a great or perfect film (particularly in the dialogue, ending and some of the acting), the first 'Final Destination' was entertaining and effective (especially with its terrific opening plane sequence and the creative deaths) with a fascinating idea done well.'Final Destination 2' gets my vote as the best of the four sequels and generally it's just as good as the first film. Like its predecessor it's patchy and uneven, but 'Final Destination 2' takes a bigger and bolder approach and executes it just as cleverly and effectively. Horror sequels have a patchy history, 'Final Destination 2' is one of the better examples. Structurally, the story is a re-tread basically except with cars rather than a plane but has enough freshness to stop it from being repetitive and the novelty from wearing off.Visually, 'Final Destination 2' may not be quite as stylish as its predecessor. It is all the same still as slick and atmospheric, with the special effects still being pretty good in particularly the opening sequence. The music has a suitable haunting eeriness.David R Ellis' direction shows a genuine understanding of the concept and the horror genre, breathing atmosphere, fun and freshness into a tried and tested formula. To me, he is second only to James Wong for the first film when it comes to ranking the 'Final Destination' films directors.Although there is a little too much of an over-reliance on gore, not all of it necessary, the death scenes are bolder, more elaborate and more creative. The film is never dull and much of it is fun, suspenseful and creepy. The highlight is the terrific opening car pile up, which is as high in the terror stakes as the opening plane sequence in the first. Liked the irony in some of the dialogue.The acting is very variable however. The best performances come from returning Ali Larter, providing a nifty link to the first, and a creepy Tony Todd. AJ Cook had her moments, but did overdo and underact some scenes, that she is so much better in 'Criminal Minds' is an understatement.Michael Landes looks uncomfortable the entire time and Jonathan Cherry is irritating. Again the characters are generally one-dimensional and not developed much beyond that which doesn't always make it easy to care for them.Excepting some nice irony and that the exposition isn't as clumsy, the dialogue doesn't flow particularly well and reeks of cheese. The ending is contrived and illogical.Overall, enjoyable if imperfect. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Final Destination 2
1,Leofwine_draca,Rip-off sequel is all about the gore and nothing else,6,14 July 2016,"Here's a sequel that didn't really need to be made – so simply throw it on the pile with all the others in the same situation. After starting off with an electrifying opening – lets just say it quickly builds up to one of the most terrifying and realistic major motorway accidents ever put on film – the plot takes a step backwards, turning into a mere lukewarm retread of the first film, in which the elaborate death scenes of the main characters take centre stage over acting, plot, and imagination. Of course, in films such as these, the death scenes make the film, and the emphasis is on gore and bloodshed here, so expect body parts to go flying (literally in some cases), sometimes ridiculously so.The cast is generally sub par, delivering lame dialogue with little intelligence or wit. Of the original cast members, only Ali Larter returns, her character greatly improved here, and Tony Todd, making another sinister cameo appearance; his role the highlight of the entire movie. Otherwise this is derivative stuff, which nonetheless builds up the tension as it goes along. The viewer is asked to engage in a fun guessing game with the writers, trying to figure out who's going to bite it next. Things end with a contrived finale in which the final 'twist' scene is so obvious and overdone, the film as a whole is flawed. Only fans of gore, death, and SFX need apply, and if you're happy to sit back and enjoy that kind of thing, then FINAL DESTINATION 2 does enough to get by.",Final Destination 2
2,SnoopyStyle,Lesser continuation of original,5,21 October 2013,"It's one year after the plane crash in the first movie. Kimberly Corman (A.J. Cook) foresees a multi-car pileup of death and destruction. Her premonition stops a whole bunch of motorists from dying, but only for awhile. Kimberly tries to seek help from Clear Rivers (Ali Larter) who is the sole survivor from the first one.The concept is no longer new. It's the same weird-things-happen and the survivors die. They hope to discover an ultimate way to defeat death by bringing new life into the world.It doesn't help that Kimberly's friends who we get introduced to are killed off right away. Most of the victims are little more than interchangeable no names to be crossed off one at a time. It's great to see Ali Larter back in the series. Too bad it feels so much like a repeat.",Final Destination 2
3,claudio_carvalho,When a Sequel Works and is as Good as the Original Movie,7,8 February 2004,"Kimberly Corman (A. J. CooK) is going to have a short travel with three friends of her on the day that the accident with flight 180 (from `Final Destination')  is celebrating one year. She has a vision of a huge accident in the highway, and she uses her car to avoid the access of the other drivers to the road. Her premonition comes true, and the survivals decide to investigate what has happened with the survivals of the plane crash. Clear Rivers (Ali Larter) is the unique who stays alive, surrounded by safety precautions. A further investigation shows the group their option to cheat death. This is one of the few sequels that are worthwhile. I myself hate sequels and remakes, but this one is really good. The accident on the road is fantastic. The story is not bad, and hooks the attention of the viewer until the final scene. Michael Landes, in the role of Officer Thomas Burke, keeps an expressionless face most of the film, and is the negative point of this good movie. My vote is seven. Title (Brazil): `Premonição 2' (`Premonition 2')",Final Destination 2
4,kosmasp,Next stop,7,29 October 2009,"Well I can safely assume, that you have seen part 1 (if not, I will be spoiling your movie experience, because I will talk a bit about the first Final Destination). Since there weren't that many survivors in part 1, we get a whole bunch of new faces thrown into the mix here. Of course, since you have seen the first one, you know what is going to happen.Still pretty intense and very gripping, although of course not as fun as the first one. As the parts progresses, you always get another setting, where something bad happens, which someone predicts or foresees and tries to save some people (even if it is by ""accident"", no pun intended). Nice new ideas of how to get rid of people, this is a fun ride.",Final Destination 2
5,Sleepin_Dragon,"A great watch, loaded with thrills and spills.",8,12 February 2018,"I loved the first film, had a definite originality to it, if I'm honest the second instalment was always my favourite in the series. It is somehow more cohesive, more gripping and generally more thrilling then the first.Kimberley's preminition is terrifying, imagine being in your car, about to pull out into a motorway/freeway and seeing that. It made me get the bus for the next few days!The writing is tight and imaginative, the production values are slick and well done, it's well acted, particularly Michael Landes, who is always great in whatever he does, I actually preferred Ali Larter's Clear in this then the first.The best in the series. 8/10",Final Destination 2
6,jboothmillard,Final Destination 2,5,17 June 2005,"If you thought it was over, then you were wrong, ""You can't cheat death twice"". When I was younger, I found this scary movie, and the other sequels, thrilling and fun, I'm glad I watched again to get a better perspective, directed by David R. Ellis (Cellular, Snakes on a Plane, Shark Night). Basically, a year has passed since the explosion of Flight 180 and the events that followed. College student Kimberly Corman (A.J. Cook) is heading to Daytona Beach, Florida for spring break with her friends, Shaina McKlank (Sarah Carter), Dano Estevez (Alejandro Rae), and Frankie Whitman (Shaun Sipos). While waiting on the entrance ramp to Route 23, she has a premonition of a deadly pileup, caused by a truck carrying logs. She stalls her car on the entrance ramp, preventing several people from entering the highway. These include lottery winner Evan Lewis (David Paetkau), widow Nora Carpenter (Lynda Boyd) and her fifteen-year-old son Tim (James Kirk), businesswoman Kat Jennings (Keegan Connor Tracy), stoner Rory Peters (Jonathan Cherry), pregnant Isabella Hudson (Justina Machado), high school teacher Eugene Dix (Terrence 'T.C.' Carson), and Deputy Marshal Thomas Burke (Michael Landes). While Officer Burke questions Kimberly, the pileup occurs. Then Kimberly is saved by Officer Burke at the last second from a speeding truck, which hits the car and kills Shaina, Dano, and Frankie. The survivors are brought to the police station, where they learn about the curse of Flight 180. Later, a chain reaction causes a fire in Evan's apartment, he barely escapes, but Evan slips and the fire escape ladder falls and impales his eye. Officer Burke researches the survivors of Flight 180 and discovers that Alex Browning was killed by a falling brick. Kimberly visits Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), the last survivor of Flight 180, who is now a voluntary patient at a psychiatric ward. Clear realises she thinks Death is after them, and during their discussion Clear realises that the survivors are dying in reverse order. Clear refuses to help but warns Kimberly to look out for the ""signs"". Upon returning home, Kimberly has a vision of a flock of pigeons attacking. She and Officer Burke rush to save Nora and Tim, who are at the dentist. But they are too late, as Tim runs at a flock of pigeons to scare them away, which causes a construction worker in a crane to accidentally hit a lever, causing a heavy glass pane to fall and crush Tim to death. Clear decides to help and introduces Kimberly and Officer Burke to mortician William Bludworth (Candyman's Tony Todd) who knows a lot about Death's design. He tells them that only ""new life"" can defeat Death. They believe that if Isabella has her baby it will ruin Death's plan and they will all be safe. Isabella is taken into custody, accused of driving a stolen vehicle, while the other survivors reunite for safety. Nora refuses to believe the theory and decides to leave, with Eugene following her. Nora is killed when her head is caught in a malfunctioning lift, she is decapitated. Eugene terrified grabs Officer Burke's gun and shoots at his head, but the bullets do not fire, as it was not his turn to die. While the others get in a car to find Isabella at the police station, she has gone into labour and is being driven to hospital. Along the way, the survivors discuss having cheated death before, and realise that they all have a connection to the survivors of Flight 180. Clear says that this is why Death is working backwards, tying up all the loose ends, sealing the rift once and for all. Since Officer Burke saved Kimberly from being hit by the truck earlier, she is last on Death's list. Their vehicle suddenly suffers a blowout, causing them to crash. Eugene is injured by PVC pipes penetrating the car, and Kat is trapped inside. As rescuers arrive at the scene, and Eugene is rushed to hospital, Brian Gibbons (Noel Fisher), the son of a farm owner, is nearly killed by a speeding news van, but Rory saves him at the last second. A rescuer tries to cut Kat out, and in doing so accidentally activating the airbag and her head is impaled by a pipe protruding from her headrest. Her cigarette falls out of her hand and into a gasoline leak leading to the news van, causing the van to explode, sending a barbed wire fence to fly, killing Rory. Kimberly, Clear, and Officer Burke rush to the hospital, and Kimberly has another vision of Doctor Kalarjian (Enid-Raye Adams) ""strangling"" Isabella. After Burke stops Dr. Kalarjian entering the operating room, they witness Isabella give birth to baby boy and assume it is over. However, Kimberly has another vision of someone with bloody hands in a submerging van and realises that Isabella was never meant to die in the pileup. Clear searches for Eugene, but accidentally causes his room to explode from an oxygen combustion, killing them both. Kimberly realises her vision is seeing her own death, she theorises that it will end if she kills herself. So, she takes a van and drives into a lake to drown herself. Kimberly is rescued by Burke and resuscitated by Kalarjian, which was her actual premonition, thus granting her new life. Sometime later, Kimberly and Burke have a barbecue with Brian's family and Kimberly's father to celebrate their survival. There they learn of Brian being saved from death, almost hit by a van, by Rory. The group then see a malfunctioning barbecue grill explode, killing Brian. Also starring Andrew Airlie as Mr. Corman, Jill Krop as Anchorwoman, Marrett Green as Anchorman, Aaron Douglas as Deputy Steve, and Eric Keenleyside as Detective Suby. All the performances are alright, it is a clever concept that the villain is Death itself stalking the victims, and the editing and pace is okay, but it is not quite as eerie and creepy as before. The chat in between slows it down a little, and it feels a bit repetitive, but for the inventive, gory, and often over-the deaths, best being the boy crushed by glass, and barb wire slicing a guy apart, it is a worthwhile enough horror thriller. Worth watching!",Final Destination 2
7,ma-cortes,Entertaining sequel and again with horrifying killings,6,31 January 2008,"This sequel of successful original by James Wong deals about beautiful girl(A.J.Cook)has a vision of car crash and aware which by avoiding it, she and others(Michael Lastres, Lynda Boyd, James Kirk,Sarah Carter,Jonathan Cherry, Kevin Connor, among them) around her have saved but soon begin dying in bizarre accidents. Being the sole character repeating from Ali Larter who now finds herself locked into sanatorium. This sequel displays suspense, tension, thrills, and creepy death. The chief excitement lies in seeing what new and astonishing victim can be dreamt by the believable FX technicians. Movie exist for only aim of murdering its protagonists and all around in terrifying realistic detail . Death seem to dispatch new weird killing every few minutes of movie, throughout car crashing, beheading, blowing up, glass crushing, fire, etc. It's frightening entertaining though predictable but we have seen the original with similar and interesting premise. Although its predictability is redeemed in part by the charismatic acting of protagonists and all around. The motion picture is well directed by David R Ellis. He has a long career as stunts coordinator, assistant director and finally filmmaker, directing Box office success such as ¨Cellular and Snakes on plane¨. Followed by a second sequel.",Final Destination 2
8,BA_Harrison,Dying for more of the same?,8,12 December 2009,"If you loved the original Final Destination, then you will almost certainly enjoy the sequel, a virtual carbon-copy of the first film, except that everything is bigger and much, much bloodier.This time around, a group of travellers narrowly avoid being involved in a spectacular freeway pile-up thanks to an eerie premonition experienced by driver Kimberly Corman (A.J. Cook) as she waits on the on-ramp. Feeling cheated once again, Death alters his grand design to try and claim the lives of those who escaped his clutches. As the survivors of the accident begin to die in the order witnessed in her vision, Kimberley realises what is happening, and tracks down the sole survivor of flight 180, Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), for help.Despite working with material that rarely explores new territory, director David R. Ellis directs with gusto: his freeway pile-up is an absolutely jaw-dropping piece of cinema—a brutal, bloody and disturbing set-piece—and the subsequent death scenes are masterfully orchestrated pieces of mayhem that tease the audience with several possible bloody conclusions, before delivering their always impressive pay-off (gory fatalities are caused by a falling ladder, a sheet of glass, a faulty elevator, an air-bag, a flying wire fence, and a barbecue!!!).In amongst the graphic bloodletting, Ellis also finds time to throw in some very nice visual touches (such as the tree shadows which resemble clutching skeletal hands) and lots of delightfully dark humour (gotta love that final shot!). A thoroughly entertaining piece of OTT popcorn horror, Final Destination 2 gets a very respectable 7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",Final Destination 2
9,dbdumonteil,death like time's got her own plans 2,5,3 June 2006,"Many horror movie fans were pleasantly surprised by the discovery in 2000 of ""Finale Destination"". Its author, James Wong who cut his teeth on the X-Files saga (I'm not a fan at all of this series) had made a killing with this classy B movie which encompassed teenage, slasher, fantastic and horror movie in the same package. The viewer remembered of the invisible but omnipresence of death which was adamant about her plans and desperately tried to kill one after the other, this bunch of students led by Alex who tried to thwart her plans. It paid off well since this mix met the public's approval. So, in the wake of this little triumph, the nearly inevitable follow-up was De Rigueur.At first sight, ""Final Destination 2"" seems to have the essential elements to have thumbs up from the audience. First, the multiple crash is impressively filmed. The director David R. Ellis who was a stunt-man and partly responsible for some action sequences in ""the Matrix Reloaded"" (2003) could show his expertise to film this vertiginous sequence. But his certain talent for directing can also be felt here and there throughout Kimberly's efforts to subvert death's plans. Then, there's a palpable, taut scenario. Many horror flicks today rely on special effects as the backbone of the film. Okay, there are rather flashy special effects here but used only when necessary. The moments during which death tries to take away the unfortunate victims are set with clockwork precision and announced with foreboding signs. Macabre humor is also more than acceptable but as the film is much more gore than the first chapter, it is not really for the faint-hearted. So, it's an enticing menu and one figures that one wouldn't want to shelve ""Final Destination 2"" in the messy department of useless sequels.But if one takes a closer look, one realizes that Ellis' film is merely a photocopy of its first edition. The strengths of the film also constitute its weaknesses. Weaknesses because the qualities which contributed in cementing the first installment in its place of winner are rehashed here without novelties. The starting point and its development are identical as the thrust of the first film: to try at all costs to outsmart death's sinister intentions which isn't prepared to accept this and that's all. The surprise effect is absent and in short, you take the same old people with adequate replacements. So, the pile-up superseded the plane crash. Then, it seems that the authors tried to justify the making of this second chapter by linking the present story to a connection with the story of the first flick (check the sequence in the middle of the film when the ill-fated ones talk about the bunch of students in the first film). But in spite of these attempts and new tricks displayed by the scenarists to try to give the story substance, it's a run-on-the-mill fantastic film.If you really enjoyed the first opus, then this may be your cup of tea. If you liked it without hailing it as a miracle, you can pass by. What's the point of watching the same story again with minor changes? And the end leaves the door open for a third episode which opened early this year. Is it any good?",Final Destination 2
10,BandSAboutMovies,Oh death,4,3 September 2020,"One year after the explosion of Flight 180, Kimberly Corman (A.J. Cook, The Virgin Suicides), Shaina McKlank (Sarah Carter), Dano Estevez (Alex Rae) and Frankie Whitman (Shaun Sipos) are saved from a multiple car pile-up when her vision keeps all the cars behind her from entering the freeway. As a cop interrogates her, her friends are killed in the eventual pileup. Now, Death is after everyone. Again.Kimberly finds Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), the last survivor of Flight 180, who is hiding from death inside a psychiatric ward (it's the same location that was Smith's Grove in Halloween: Resurrection) after Alex Browning's (Devon Sawa, who doesn't even show up) off-screen death. She introduces her to William Bludworth (Tony Todd), who informs her that only new life can stop what Death wants.Soon, everyone is dying in reverse of the order they were originally to croak and the gore has been upped considerably from the last movie. The car crash at the open of the film is enough to keep anyone from getting behind the wheel.It was directed by David R. Ellis, who also did the last film in this series and Snakes on a Plane. He was also a child actor with Kurt Russell in several Disney films before becoming a stuntman and second unit director.",Final Destination 2
11,Coventry,Exactly the same...only a little grosser,5,30 January 2005,"Final Destination 1 was one of the only films ever which basic plot-idea made me feel uncomfortable. Not that the film was so mesmerizing or outstanding but simply the idea of a higher force (= death) following you around because your time has come made me somewhat worried. The inevitable sequel to this unexpected little horror-hit has little ambition and practically re-tells the exact same story with different characters (duh!) and even filthier gore. This time, it's a girl (named after horror maestro Roger Corman) who receives a portentous premonition about a horrible road-accident and so saves the life of a group of people that were waiting at the traffic lights. Of course Mr. Grim Reaper isn't about to let them off this easily and the all start dying in ludicrously exaggerated ways (death by flying fence!!). The idiotic theories and added sub-plots are desperate attempts to make the wholesome look at least a little different than the first while the presence of Ali Larter (survivor of the original) is entirely unnecessary. I could also bring up that this film is offensive and contemptuous for portraying death as a simple special effect but I'm not going there because I don't want to give the impression that I totally disliked this film. The shock effects and visuals are astonishing and especially the initial car accident is horrific and very unsettling. The film is completely tensionless and it amazes me how cold and careless everyone's reactions are when yet another person horribly died right in front of their eyes. I can be brief about the acting performances since movies like this simply don't require skilled sense of dialogue. They all do their best, I guess, but it remains Tony ""Candyman"" Todd who steals the show with his 2 minutes guest appearance. Final Destination 2 is worthy horror viewing as long as you're not in a too demanding mood. Maybe the best way to look at it is picturing it as a morbid version of America's Funniest Home Videos.",Final Destination 2

Cook)has a premonition of an equally devastating pileup on the highway. She intentionally blocks the highway trying to save lives; those survivors mysteriously one by one become victims of bizarre and gruesome deaths. Sadistic humor infiltrates the gore.

14,hitchcockthelegend,Buckle up.,7,12 June 2009,"Kimberly Corman has a terrifying vision that a highway pile up will claim her life and that of her friends. Blocking the entrance with her car, Kimberly watches in horror as the crash unfolds, thus saving her life and that of the people in the queue behind her. But the grim reaper is not impressed and he's coming to claim the deaths of all those who should have died in the crash.For a sequel to truly work well it has to come up with something fresh, otherwise why do a sequel eh? Well the makers of Final Destination 2 choose to use the basic same formula of the hugely enjoyable first film, only adding more black humour into the crazy death design broth. Opening with a quite horrific highway pile up, FD 2 then takes us on a journey that sees an assortment of folk offed in various and gruesome ways. The story remains the same as the first film, even though writers Bress and Gruber think they are being intricate by weaving this plot into the original story, but ultimately it's just a devilishly nonsense fun picture. Ali Larter returns for a second helping, and she in turn is joined by a bunch of no mark actors waiting for death, which is perfectly fine for the genre discerning fan.This is a riot, and as long as you don't look too deep into it (why would you really?) you may just find yourself having a real good time. 7/10",Final Destination 2
15,Theo Robertson,Clever And Entertaining Sequel,7,8 August 2010,"The original FINAL DESTINATION was a smart reworking of the teen horror film . Instead of horny teenagers getting their heads lopped off by a mad axeman in a mask , the protagonists , who are composed of a cross section of society , are stalked by the worst monster in the world - death itself . FINAL DESTINATION 2 follows the same formula Kevin Williamson pointed out in one of his screenplays for SCREAM that sequels up the ante , everything has to be that little bit bigger with a higher body count and the sequel gets off to a great start with a premonition of an explosive car crash . The film's heroine Kimberly knows what's coming next so holds up the traffic saving numerous drivers from a fiery death . Unfortunately destiny doesn't like being cheated and no one will be appearing on WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE , the bad things that are going to happen to the protagonists will indeed be final There's a term used by film critics called "" Hierarchy of image "" which , if the director lingers on an object then it has meaning to the plot . Ironically perhaps the best example of this is the television series CASUALTY where if the camera shows a chip pan then you can be sure it'll burst in to flames later in the sequence . In some ways this is a film employing the anti- hierarchy of image since it toys with the audience in to thinking they're going to see an object kill the hapless victim only for the rug to be pulled from under their feet . It's a different take on the horror film and it probably doesn't stand up to a second viewing since all the surprises are gone but it's highly entertaining the first time you see it",Final Destination 2

She manages to save some people from the accident...but Death won't be cheated and goes after the ones who were supposed to die.The same silly premise as the first one used--it was interesting once, but gets really silly the second time around. The opening car disaster is great--exciting, violent and bloody. Also the killings later on are also violent, bloody and (sometimes) amusing. There's one good performance (by Cook) and an interesting connection to the first movie...but that's about it. Otherwise it's horribly acted with boring dialogue and characters and situations that get more and more unlikely.Do yourself a favor...wait for it on DVD/video and just fast forward through it for the killings.

17,LeonLouisRicci,Shadowed by a Great OriginalA Guilty PleasureOr Not,7,30 March 2015,"Taken on its Own Terms, these types of Movies have to be Compared to its Peers and not High Art. This is either a Guilty Pleasure or not.The Final Destination Sequel doesn't have the Luxury of being Groundbreaking or Clever. This is Number 2 and it is Spinning Off those accolades and delivering a Cash-In and seems like it was done Only for just That.It means that this is More of the Same. It might be that the Third Entry can go for Deeper Insights and Suspense, but it was not to be for the Follow-Up. The opening ""Highway to Hell"" pile up is one of the most Visceral and Smashing Car Crashes ever put on Film. It is Stunning.The rest of the reveals are no where Near as Engaging and are Nothing more than Semi-Clever ways to Countdown those that have Cheated Death.The Formula shows signs of boring Repetitiveness in the Dialog about Death and its Plan. It Has become more Airy-Fairy in its explanations that were there in the Original but then it was all New Stuff.Now its just seems Blah, Blah, Blah...Death's Design...Blah, Blah, Blah, Who's Next?, and so forth. The Gore is Great and the ""Fun"" is there if You Turn Off Your Analysis and sink Into Your bucket of Popcorn.

18,poolandrews,Great sequel.,8,20 January 2007,"Final Destination 2 starts as Kimberly Corman (A.J. Cook) & three of her friends set off for Denver, while on the highway Kimberly foresees an accident in which she, her friends & several other people die. Kimberly is shook up by the vision & refuses to carry on, as she is spoken to by officer Thomas Burke (Michael Landes) on the side of the road the huge accident she foresaw happens. She is saved although her friends still get killed while several other people who were supposed to die in the accident are also prevented from death by being held up behind Kimberly's car. Everyone just assumes that they were extremely lucky & that's that, but later that day Evan Lewis (David Paetkau) who was supposed to die in the highway pile-up is killed in a freak accident. Kimberly starts to have more visions as she foresees the death's of the people she saved, the people who were supposed to die & the people who seemingly cheated death. But death won't be cheated & if your time is up, your time is up...Directed by David R. Ellis I thought Final Destination 2 was a throughly entertaining film & a worthy sequel. The script by J. Mackye Gruber & Eric Bress does what every good sequel should, it takes the original premise, elaborates on it, makes everything more spectacular & cranks things up a notch while being a fine film in it's own right. The basic Final Destination (2000) story is here, in fact in some ways you could call it as much a remake as a sequel as the two films are virtually the same but I found it great to watch as things get off to a spectacular start with a terrific highway pile-up & then the rest of the film as death catches up with the protagonists, I liked the way the accidents happen & the intricate build-ups to them with all manner of coincidences that lead to the unfortunate victims demise. Having said that things do turn a little silly at the end as it becomes too supernatural with things moving on their own, doors being jammed & these scenes felt too deliberate & not down to random chance or coincidence. There are some clever references to the original, the character's are good & pretty likable & as a whole I thought it was a throughly entertaining & watchable film that moves along at a great pace.Director Ellis does a great job & he builds the tension up in the run up to the kills very effectively. There are plenty of other fun film references including some of he character's being named after various horror directors. The kills are cool & quite graphic, the pile-up has someone lose their head via a huge log, someone is squashed to a bloody pulp, there's a decapitation, someone gets a spike through their head, someone is sliced up by barb wire, someone gets a ladder impaled in their eye & there's a pleasing amount of blood. The special effects are very good with the initial pile-up being particularly impressive.With a supposed budget of about $26,000,000 Final Destination 2 is extremely well made & has that Hollywood polish about it. The acting is OK & a special mention goes to Keegan Connor Tracy as Kat whom I rather fancied...Final Destination 2 is a top film that I enjoyed immensely & it's as simple & straight forward as that. Definitely recommend, another sequel Final Destination 3 (2006) has been made.",Final Destination 2
19,lastliberal,"Brian, I think you'd better go check that barbecue.",7,17 February 2008,"This was almost like a flashback to a few weeks ago when the exact same thing happened for real on Interstate 4. It wasn't a log truck, but fog and a controlled burn that caused an 80-car pileup and much burning of trucks and bodies. I could not help but think of that when I saw the incredible accident scene in this film. It could have been used as news footage.This is probably only the second film in which I have seen A.J. Cook (JJ from ""Criminal Minds"") and Ali Larter (""Heroes""), but they did a credible job in a film where the story was far more important than the individual characters, none of whom rose to any significance. In fact. most were probably former WB stars. The only one I remember with any interest was Odessa Munroe.But the story and the special effects and the gore and, certainly, the suspense, made this film worth watching and peaked my interest in the prequel and the sequel, although not having seen the first one does not take anything away from this one.Check it out.",Final Destination 2
20,Boba_Fett1138,More of the same creatively put together.,7,8 June 2006,"In this case, more of the same, is not a bad thing. Basically the movie its plot is just the same as in ""Final Destination"", only with different characters and settings this time. I however feel that the Final Destination franchise is one of the few horror-movie franchises that can have multiple sequels, without loosing any of its power or originality. The concept of the movie can be used over and over again; a person has a vision of an upcoming accident which will lead to the death of several people. Thanks to that vision the person prevents himself/herself and others from dying. They cheat death but the death eventually catches up with them again, as every person that should had died during the accident, dies one by one.""Final Destination"" had a plane crash, ""Final Destination 2"" has a highway pileup. Sounds smaller and less impressive but it really isn't. The car crashes are massive and awesomely choreographed and filmed. It truly honestly is one of the very best and certainly most spectacular car crashes out of cinema history. You have to see it to believe it. It's one of the things in the movie that makes it obvious that this time they had a far bigger budget to spend, compared to the first movie. Not only the beginning is more spectacular, also the deaths later on in the movie are better constructed and especially better looking and more graphic. The story and concept of the movie might not be original anymore but the death certainly are. It makes ""Final Destination 2"" a wonderful sequel that still can be original and surprising, even when you've already seen the first movie.The movie however makes a crucial mistake. Basically the movie has a fresh story with new characters and settings but yet it feels the need to constantly refer to the events in the first movie and even bring back a character from the first movie. A quick reference to the events in the first movie would have sufficed but instead the movie heavily relies on the events of the first movie. It makes the movie a bit hard and less understandable to watch for persons who haven't seen the first movie. Basically every Final Destination movie should be a movie on its own, with new characters and settings every time. I haven't seen part 3 yet but I hope they haven't made the same mistake there.But really, who cares about the story in a movie like this. Basically all that makes this movie good and original are the deaths that are featured in it. They are extremely graphic and quite brilliantly put together. You just never know what is going to happen, which helps to make the sequences tense as well as scary. It doesn't really matter that the characters aren't really interesting and the story is quite unlikely and far fetched at certain moments.An highly recommendable horror sequel but perhaps only if you've also seen the first movie.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Final Destination 2
21,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"More gory than the first, but not as good",7,22 December 2003,"The director obviously thought that when making a sequel, everything has to be bigger and heavier. But bigger doesn't equal better, and it definitely isn't the case here. The death scenes are unnecessary gory, and only that; practically no build-up to the scenes, and little to no excitement. Unless you enjoy watching extremely bloody, gory death scenes, you won't like this movie. In fact, you will most likely hate it, unless you're a big fan of the genre, or of the first Final Destination. It's a huge gore fest, and probably made for(and maybe even by) fans of the old ""body-count"" movies, from the 1980's. It has very little realism; whereas the first Final Destination had some realism in the death scenes, this had little to none at all. As many other slasher movies, it has the little ""twist-in-the-end"" at the very end, but it is very weak, considering what it could have been. The first movie is a lot better, but if you *need* to watch a gory movie where you pretty much sit around and wait for people to die, this isn't the worst you can watch. But if the choice is between this and the first, I would definitely choose the first. 7/10",Final Destination 2
22,view_and_review,6 million ways to die and Final Destination wants to show every one,4,8 March 2007,"I didn't like the absurd and grossly ridiculous ways in which people were being killed in the first Final Destination. So what do I get to see in Final Destination 2?? More absurd and grossly ridiculous ways for people to be killed. I mean, a section of barbed wire fence somehow gets propelled directly at a guy and trisects him. HA!! Was that a joke? Or was that supposed to be part of the mysterious eeriness of death? And they made it more of a caricature of the first movie by having the fated few be able to predict the manner in which the next person would die by certain glaringly obvious but supposedly subtle hints. I didn't like the first Final Destination, but at least it was a new concept then and had originality. FD2 is just the same concept with new ways to die, but still pretty much the exact same movie.",Final Destination 2

Call me.",10,6 October 2018,"Final Destination 2 is the perfect sequel, for what it could be. With better characterization, better death scenes and humour.The action gets under way rather quickly and never stops. A good cast, particularly the lead A.J. Cook. I like Ali Larter, but the film's better when the characters aren't trying to solve the puzzle, so it could of done without her. The explanation that everyone involved is suppose to be already dead, because things were altered to kill the survivors of flight 180, superb and validates the sequel's existence. That scene drags a little though, more carnage please! Those logs falling off the back of the truck and the lottery winner stuck in the garbage disposal, the finest moments. Are you not entertained!! Disagree with most of the reviews on here, this film far exceeds what the first had to offer and it isn't just a repeat. The characters aren't one-dimensional for a start. I'm just noticing, two of the writers for this wrote and directed ""The Butterfly Effect,"" one of my absolute favourites.",Final Destination 2
24,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Simply wonderful and watchable sequel,10,23 June 2016,"When a vivid premonition stops here from participating in a massive accident, a woman tries to convince those she's saved that the strange accidents they're involved in are a matter of death insuring his plans are carried out and tries to stop them.This one was an immensely enjoyable sequel that really rivals the original. Among the better qualities here is that this one manages to really portray a truer sense of dread and suspense about the situation as this one really gets a lot of great facts about the surroundings really affecting everyday life. This one really bridges that concept from the first one even further here by making the accidents seem so far out of of logical realms that they're simply, truly accidents brought about through actual, honest coincidences which makes for a rather tense time throughout the first half b building this through the repeated visions, the first few deaths and the call-backs to what happened in the original. This is compounded by the tendency here to showcase the warning signs rather well here as the suspenseful nature of these supposed encounters is some incredible foreshadowing on what's going to happen, and the fact that there's some rather creepy moments from these issues makes this quite fun. The film's best feature, though, is based off the most impressive part of the story here in it's really freaky action-packed encounters here starting with the film's high-point of the opening car crash. There's a fine piece of spectacle to be had here in seeing the kind of high-impact mangling of cars, vehicular stunt- work and continued continuations that not only provide this one with plenty of suspense building up to the crash, action with all the different spectacle encounters as well as the gory deaths along the way. Other big scenes here, from the insanely tense encounter in the doctor's office with several close calls here with the different traps with the electrified water almost getting here and the different false reactions here to the eventual death, the scenes in the apartment are really fun with the false scares followed by the actual kill in the lobby following the revelations found earlier and the absolutely fun encounter in the field makes for a great scene with the splendid set-up in the care beforehand which ties their fates into the original as well as showing another big crash and the fun, over-the-top kills that are present here makes this one incredibly fun. These here are the film's good points which manages to hold off the few flaws here. It's all in the finale here which really seems to meander around with numerous side-plots, rather middling suspense scenes and the rare occasions where the traps just seem contrived and the whole affair seems to be quite the letdown from what came before it. There's also the small factor of this one going for the same route the original in terms of how the story's paid off, but it's not as big a deal here. Otherwise, this one was quite the impressive enough sequel.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity and drug use.",Final Destination 2

Kim also makes a visit to Clear Rivers (Ali Larter from the original). Substituting inventiveness with more gore, this film is lacking the wit that Glen Morgan and James Wong gave the first one and their non-involvement is surely missed.

26,Wuchakk,"Solid sequel, maybe a notch better than the first film",7,31 October 2018,"The first ""Final Destination"" movie from 2000 was a rather innovative 'Dead Teenager Movie' in that the killer was Death itself, the Grim Reaper, as an invisible spiritual presence. A group of people, mostly youths, escape a great tragedy due to a premonition of one of them and the rest of the movie involves the Grim Reaper systematically slaying those who cheated Death in various creative ways, usually involving an unlikely chain reaction. The opening tragedy in the first film was a plane crash; in this second film from 2003 it's a horrible highway pile-up; in the third it's a roller-coaster mishap and so on.There are currently five films in the franchise and they all tell the same basic story with different characters and some nuances; they're all of the same high quality of technical filmmaking. Whether you prefer one or another depends on whether you like the cast and the death sequences (and the locations) because, other than these factors, they're all basically the same, although the fifth film throws in an interesting new twist (Death's victim can find a substitute).Ali Larter returns as a secondary protagonist while A.J. Cook takes the reigns of the 'final girl.' Keegan Connor Tracy also has a considerable role in the female department while Sarah Carter has a smaller part. While this is a quality assortment of women, the creators coulda done more with them. On the opposite side of the gender spectrum Michael Landes stars as a state trooper. Jonathan Cherry, Terrence 'T.C.' Carson and James Kirk are also on hand. Their importance to the story is in that order. Meanwhile Tony Todd makes his second of four appearances in the series as a mortician who curiously knows more than he should.I actually like this one a little better than the first one, but like that film, the second half isn't as strong as the first. Is the final scene supposed to be horrific? Cuz it made me bust out laughing.The film runs 1 hour, 30 minutes and was shot in the Vancouver, British Columbia, area, including Campbell River (although the events take place around New York City).GRADE: B/B-",Final Destination 2
27,mm-39,Better than the first.,7,2 February 2003,"There is 2 elements that clash with this film.  One the horror gore element, and 2nd the philosophy part.  Yes there is a philosophy in this madness. The horror gore element will evolve into the modern Friday the 13th sequals. I can see Final destination 12 years form now with young people dieing in more dramatic fashions with each film.  Instead of a Goalie mask, and the woods as the fear stimulus, we got death and fate against us.  The first film was wimpy, especially the lead character, the new film picks up speed, and believe me the momentum will pick up with each film.  The pilosophy part of the film is about fate or absolutism verses free will and choice.  I believe if Death has a design and people out living there fate makes a time ripple against its own ends there would be no way to stop it, and the characters efforts would be useless.  The film makers create chaos theory were random event can create an order that has great effects on individuals. The plate of pasta, and the gas turn off would be 2 examples of this.  The film has its usual gross outs, and sick humor.  In the end, I give it a 7/10",Final Destination 2
28,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Final Destination 2,6,20 May 2007,"The saga continues with Final Destination 2, where Ali Larter returns as Clear Rivers (how can you take anyone seriously with a name like that?), in a sequel which rehashes the same premise of premonition and therefore death avoidance, and the survivors this time round getting picked off one by one in similar violent fashion fit only for the screens.The one with the powers this time is Kimberly Corman (A.J. Cook), who along with her buddies are going on a road trip. However, she sees a violent accident along the highway they were supposed to travel on, and prevents herself, her mates and a whole host of drivers in other vehicles from going on that ill fated strip, so before you know it, they defeat death's design for them.But Final Destination says death will return to get the souls already earmarked, and here, the same drill applies. Despite the filmmakers here being a totally different team from the original, there are bouts of acknowledgements all around that ties the second movie to the first. Like the setting of the film exactly a year after the first, the return of Ali Larter, and a realization that all the characters here have indirect ties to those in the original. It might sound like a bad case of coincidence, but this is movieland after all.The highway pileup is interesting enough, though the jarring censored bits in this locally pressed DVD made the best bloody bits unavailable. And there were new rules and conditions shared in this sequel, which is probably a good thing to prevent it from being just an extension of the first. What made it a little more riveting was that the characters here experience that feeling that nothing is worse than having to know you have to die, and then waiting for it to happen. The first had most of them pretty much clueless, or much against the ridiculous idea, but here, the group had that set aside pretty quickly, and nothing is more fearful than waiting for your time to expire.The finale suffered though from needing to meet its self-fulfilling prophecy, but made up for it with its totally wicked ending. It doesn't lead to the third movie (each can work as a stand alone), but for those who did not watch FD1, this one pretty much summarizes it all for you. The Code 3 DVD by Alliance Entertainment comes with the widescreen edition with Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound. However, remind me not to get a locally pressed DVD when there's expected blood and gore. With movies like these, sadly the gory scenes get censored away, and all you get are frustrating cut scenes and jarring edits. Subtitles are available in English and Chinese, and scene selection is available over 15 chapters.The bonus features are quite scanty, with the teaser trailer (1:33), 2 music videos - The Blank Theory's Middle of Nowhere (4:16) and The Sounds' Seven Days a Week (3:20), and a series of deleted scenes.The deleted scenes were non-selectable, and instead of having split up the scenes, you can only view them all together. A total of 5 scenes are lumped into one 9:52 feature, featuring the initial interview at the police station, an extended scene with the mortician, looking for Isabella Hudson, a short scene where Nora was handed a cellphone at the elevator, and additional scenes in the truck en route to the hospital with an extended hospital scene.Decent efforts in visual and audio transfers, but short on the extras. Gone are the audio commentaries from the filmmakers, would sure like to listen to how they did the highway scene.",Final Destination 2
29,StevePulaski,Remains on the right track.,8,10 August 2011,"Here we have sequel, that is essentially the same as the first film, but provides a lot more thrills and a lot more special effects than the first. Final Destination 2 has the same scheme as its predecessor - the hero of the film, this time a female named Kimberly (Cook), is on a road-trip with her best friend and her two pot smoking buddies. She has a premonition on the road that she is one of the many victims to a deadly traffic pileup. She blocks the on-ramp so no one can get by, the premonition comes true, various people survive, but are then killed off in the order they would've died if she hadn't blocked the road. There we have Final Destination 2.It's safe to say we get more of a variety in our characters this time around. In the original, it was all students aboard a flight to Paris. This time, we have a student, a mother, a teacher, a lottery winner, a pregnant women, a drug-addict, a self-centered woman, and a police officer. Clear Rivers (Larter) from the original film returns here to pair up with Kimberly and police officer Thomas Burke (Landes) to try and stop death's design.The idea is we all have a fate, but the flaw is we can cheat it. In this case, Kimberly and the crew's fate was to die in the pileup, but due to her lucky premonition everyone is saved. After you cheat death and save yours and many other lives the only way you can prevent the rest of the gang from dying is for the person who had the premonition to commit suicide or have a child being born, creating new life somehow saving the rest of the people. You're better off not to question the idea, and just go along for the ride.The special effects in this are sub-par to the first film. The problem with the first film was that some of the death sequences were at night, and some, didn't involved many crafty designs, or twists and turns, most likely because it was the first of its kind. They didn't know their standard. But still, Final Destination had some memorable and quite impressive death scenes. Especially when you consider frequent hidden hints and ""180"" appearances.Final Destination 2 offers a bit more build-up by showing something falling, shifting, sliding, moving, etc. The trigger effect that leads to these deaths is perfect, and reminds me why I love this franchise. It can go above and beyond everything if it just remains realistic and plausible.There are a few problems sadly. For one thing, some scenes in the morgue and the mental-institute are poor build-ups to the main event. They last long, and tend to ramble. It's best to try and make the rule make sense to you, rather than listen to a bunch of people talk about it. My advice; watch the first film. Watch it again. Get an idea of how this design works, and then continue to watch the remaining films in the franchise. Eventually, it will come to you. Patience is a virtue.One question I asked myself in the first film was ""Why Alex?"" Up until about halfway through, I asked ""Why Kimberly?"" The film provides logical information on why it's Kimberly's turn to have the premonition. But I still I have two questions; (1) Why does this premonition aspect exist if its purpose is to mess up Death's plan? Don't you think Death (I love how I'm using him as a real person right now) would try everything to stop this premonition? And the premonition sequence lasted about four minutes in this film. You couldn't tell me Kimberly sat stopped on the on-ramp, in utter silence with two talkative pot-buddies in the back seat and her annoying blonde friend without them shaking her or talking to her, and no one from other cars behind her came up to knock on her window. They took all the plausibility, pumped it into the death sequences in the film, but at the same time, drained it from the events leading up to the deaths. Never heard of that happening.Clearly, I'm over-analyzing what is supposed to be an enjoyable horror flick. That it was. Final Destination still remains calm, and not cocky, and cartoonish like one would think. While some franchises get carried away, for now, Final Destination is on the right track.Starring: Ali Larter, A. J. Cook, Michael Landes, and Tony Todd. Directed by: David R. Ellis.",Final Destination 2
30,Smells_Like_Cheese,Very cool,8,16 November 2006,"Well, I just finished Final Destination 2 and may I say that it is so cool to find a sequel that is just up to par with the original. Normally, most sequels attack the original and loose it's originality. But Final Destination 2 had a cool story with many more awesome deaths and scary suspenseful scenes. I loved the story and I understand finally why these movies are so well liked.This time there is a girl, Kimberly, is about to go on a road trip with her friends. But right before she gets on the main high way, she has a horrible vision that she is about to get into a horrible accident causing the biggest pile up in car accident history, when she comes too, a cop pulls her over and she gets out of the car telling him that there is going to be a crash. It happens, but her SUV with her friends get tragically hit and killed leaving Kim alive with an officer that was also supposed to be killed. Everyone who was supposed to be killed on that road is dying off one by one, so she looks to the help of a person who has been through this before, Clear.Final Destination 2 was a great sequel and I would highly recommend it for any horror fans. Even though I knew what was going to be the last scene, it was so cool watching it. Although I'm questioning the plot somewhat, because now it seems like almost everyone is going to die, but I guess that's the whole scary point of the story.8/10",Final Destination 2
31,=G=,Mo of da same,5,7 December 2004,"Death has a list. And if you're on the list, you're going to die in the order in which you appear on the list. Of course, if someone doesn't die on schedule that creates a ripple in death's plan and if a child is born to a mother who was scheduled to die then someone on the list may be allowed to live...I think. Anyhoo, that's probably all wrong but you're not going to care about the plot anyway as you watch this sequel to ""Final Destination 1"" in which a coed hooks up with a cop and a throwback from the original flick to thwart death's master plan. Though the film lacks in cohesion and sensibility, it is chock full of cause-effect chain reactions which result in a stuntfest and grisly actions sequences throughout. Probably a tad less than the original (which isn't bad for a sequel), FD2 is a worthwhile watch for anyone into gory horror action dramas made with the old teen and young adult crowd in mind. (C+)",Final Destination 2
32,thesar-2,Death on the Highway,8,19 February 2011,"In one of the best openings, or scenes I've watched, Final Destination 2 takes the lead immediately. Typically, this is where I generally say: ""And then it went south from there"" or ""It got progressively worse.""Thankfully, noit didn't. For horror franchise fans, this was comparably to how Scream 1 and 2 panned out, in regards to quality, intelligence, surprises, keeping it fresh and making a film as equal, if not superior to the original.There's a new girl in town, and she's lookingat Death. Kimberly's (Cook) about to start a fun weekend with her clichéd friends when all-of-a-sudden (not really, if you've seen part 1) she has a vision of a massive pileup on the forthcoming highway killing her and scores of others. When she comes to, she blocks the cars behind her from entering the highway and this draws attention of police officer Thomas (Landes, one-time Jimmy Olsen).As stated/spoiled by mentioning the series original film, the crash does take place, though there are several ""survivors"" thanks to Kimberly's quick thinking. While they're a bit and reasonably shaken up, Kimberly puts the pieces together knowing that this exact thing happened one year prior.And again, as the ""survivors"" die in incredibly new and creative ways, the new cast uses the old to help through this mess: Clear Rivers (Larter) and Bludworth (Todd.)I'm really making this out to be a rehash, and for the most part it is. But, the ""new"" explanation/revolution is not only thoroughly thought out, but kept the series (ONLY TO THIS SEQUEL) fresh and inventive. Also, Larter up'd the ante, much like what Linda Hamilton did for Sarah Connor in Terminator 2: Judgment Day. So it was nice to not only see her again, but see how much she's grown as an actress by this point.I've said it before, in regards to Part One, the rest of the case did what was required of them and the movie was well-made and highly creative, though – again – hokey at times. It's recommended to make it a double feature with the first one, even though it even works as a stand-alone film. And finally, as I mentioned, the extremely detailed opening wreck scene is worth the entire viewing.",Final Destination 2

34,Robert_duder,"Campy, poorly acted, and wickedly gory!!! Still a must see!!",7,22 July 2006,"I'm kind of seeing this series again in reverse. I saw the terrific third installment and happened to catch the second recently. I remember always being impressed with this series but found this time around a little campy. Has it always been this campy?? I don't know but Final Destination still has a way of scaring the living daylights out of you and imagining EVERY worse case scenario. Whereas the first one made you scared to death to ever set foot on a place, this one makes you never want to see another car for the rest of your life. Within the first half hour you are treated to one of the goriest, horrendous, shocking death scene car crashes I have ever seen. Brilliantly directed, shockingly real and brutal...it's just horrifying. Following that we are given the usual Final Destination track down as Death systematically begins to murder each survivor in the most obscure, original, and horrifying ways imaginable. If anything Final Destination has breathed new life into original death scenes which is a must for the Horror/Slasher genre and Final Destination has it nailed. I don't know how the writers continue to come up with it. It's always a surprise and you never know what's going be the death of them.A.J. Cook picks up the lead as Kimberly Corman, the psychic girl who envisions the car crash the saves a group from dying but sets them up in Death's path. Cook is a little bland and over acts in several scenes adding to the campy feel of the film. Campy is not bad, especially in the horror genre but Final Destination feels like it should be more intelligent than campy. Cook does an okay job but her emotions don't really match the situations. Within hours of three of her best friends dying in the most horrific way she appears to be fine. When discovering Death is stalking them, despite a few tense moments, she doesn't seem overly moved by it. They could have cast better but she is alright. Michael Landes (Jimmy Olsen from one of my favorite TV classic Series Lois and Clark) is Officer Thomas Burke, the male lead. He always looks like a deer caught in the headlights which I suppose is the proper look given the situation. He doesn't quite have the acting strength to carry off the lead role and all in all he doesn't get subjected to the same amount of torture as the rest of them. Still him and Cook have decent chemistry although no romance is ever implied and he does a decent job much as Cook does. Ali Larter returns as the only returning character from the original film as Clear Rivers. Disturbed and having herself locked away to protect herself she finally comes out to help the new batch of survivors beat Death (because she did so well the first time everyone but her being dead now.) She is good as the veteran of the team but she does come across as a bit of a raving mad woman at times. But I won't complain because I love cross overs from previous horror installments into new ones. I'm glad they brought her back especially since I usually can't stand Devon Sawa (who was the lead in the original.) The rest of the cast in their small roles as eventual victims all do a decent job of blatantly establishing their characters and thus becoming victims of circumstance to their personalities.The problem with Final Destination 2 over the previous one and the latter one is the cast. It's not nearly as strong as it has been or is now and the cast over acts and comes across as cheesy which is never good given the horrifying original death scenes. But because of a strong script of horror and the establishment of a connection between this film and the previous one it's a must see. The Death scenes are infamous and classic and original and just shocking it's almost funny but you feel scared to death as you chuckle at them. The story line is a little difficult and it feels a little forced especially the connection to the original and the way they end things up in how they ""conquer"" Death. They try to be fresh and original but overall doesn't exactly work as far as the story line goes. It's more complex than it should be. Stunt man David R. Ellis who has a huge film coming out this summer ""Snakes On A Plane"" is obviously well versed in stunts and choreographing harrowing scenes but his direction of cast might need something to be desired. Still #2 in the series you must see just because as a whole the trilogy to date is one of the most unique horror thrillers to be made in recent years. Horror fans will love it!! 7/10",Final Destination 2
35,MOscarbradley,Good grisly fun,6,17 January 2007,"Beginning with the mother of all car crashes this isn't so much a sequel to ""Final Destination"" as a reprise and it's good, grisly fun though this time round the element of surprise is missing. In the first movie it was the survivors of a plane crash that death picked off one by one. Here it's the survivors of that car crash after mousy heroine Kimberley has a premonition and prevents death from claiming all of his victims at one go. It is, of course, deeply silly with a fright factor that is no higher or lower than a good fairground ride. But then who doesn't love being scared to death by a good fairground ride? Dismemberment has never been so much fun.",Final Destination 2
36,CuriosityKilledShawn,Better than the first,8,11 May 2004,"Anyone who knows me knows how much I loathed the first movie. It was truly wretched. Though this one was surprisingly good. It had better (or just less annoying) characters that you don't want to die (the first movie made the mistake of being populated with awful characters), more inventive death attacks and developed the idea of death having a design more interestingly.Clear Rivers (Ali Larter) is the only remaining survivor of flight 180 and has now willingly committed herself to a rubber room to escape death's shadow. But lets herself out into the world when learning of a new disaster. A teenager (AJ Cook) on a trip with her pals has a premonition of an incredibly violent freeway pile-up (so more inventive than a distant boom in the sky; the first movie's disaster) and stalls traffic in her lane. Sure enough the pile up happens and all the drivers who she stalled should be dead too. So death begins to stalk them. But no one has any time for the warnings Clear Rivers has to offer and so death offs them in increasing gory fashion.It's lowbrow and pure popcorn fun but you'll definitely enjoy it. If only the first one didn't exist then this would be more unique experience. Still, buying this DVD would be cool because the 1.85:1 anamorphic picture and the DTS 6.1 sound are incredible.

I give it 4 out of 10 because it is awful. The only good thing about this movie is that it is a precursor to Final destination 3. That is a very scary movie. Do not see this movie just see Final destination 3. And how is it abuse just to say my opinion. I mean it. If you do not agree fine. But how dare you delete my review just because I did not agree with you you bully. Stop deleting my reviews. You want to say this is better then Final destination 3 just because it was made first that is fine. This is not abuse. This not something agents you. Has far has I am I am concerned the story line in this is awful and it is not scary. There for it is not a good movie. You want to give it 10 out of 10 go ahead. Just do not winning that I abuse you just because I do not agree with you. Do not see this awful movie. And do not delete my reviews. It is a shame that good actors wasted there talent being in this movie. And it is a shame that the man who wrote The Butter fly effects wrote this. Because he could do better.,Final Destination 2

40,paulclaassen,Watch it out of curiosity only...,3,24 April 2020,"Ok, so now we're already familiar with the story and know what to expect. Unfortunately, this film offers nothing new to the plot. Instead, it plays like a remake of 'Final Destination'. So much so that there really was no need for this film, and it therefore serves to please those who haven't seen the first film.The film actually follows on 'Final Destination'. Ali Larter reprises her role of Clear Rivers (seriously, that's the character's name!!). Hardly 20 minutes into the film, though, there are so many plot flaws. I must admit, the highway crash sequence was incredible. But why did the random drivers at the scene also go to the police station? Why were they involved? And why are only a handful involved then, and not everyone Kimberley blocked? They should have made it clearer that these people would have died in the crash had she not blocked them off. It would have made a lot more sense if her friends were involved. It's therefore not as good - or effective - a setup as the first film.Whereas the first film was rather serious, here they added humor. There honestly is some humor - and dialogue - that doesn't belong. It completely ruined the film's potential suspense. Quite a number of scenes were unnecessarily comical.The first victim dies much too soon after the incident - before we even got to know him. The killings are more brutal and more far-fetched than the first film, although it can essentially still happen in real life.The acting was unfortunately nothing to write home about. The make-up effects were very good, though. As for the film in general: forgettable.Would I watch it again? No.",Final Destination 2
41,sol-,More Foresight,6,6 October 2017,"Another premonition about a freak accident leads to a different group of 'death cheating' survivors fearing for their lives in this surprisingly decent sequel. While the crash/collision scenes are magnificently intense and very realistic, 'Final Destination 2' does not get off to the strongest start and the first half of the movie feels like more of a remake or rehash of the original, except with even more inventive and elaborate deaths. As the film progresses though, there are some chilling ""outward ripple"" connections made to the characters from the first movie, which makes the overall project more interesting as an extrapolation on the events of Part One. And yet, even if one does walk away feeling that this is more of a rehash than a sequel, there are several improvements here. The death scenes, for instance, always leaving one guessing as to just what will deliver the fatal blow, the characters are more varied and have more personality than in the first film, plus there is quite a bit of comic relief that actually works. The sequel does not, however, have the visual panache that James Wong brought to the first film and nothing compares to Devon Sawa's hyper-awareness scenes in Part One. The basic idea is also not quite so fresh while delivering the same unanswered questions. As alluded to though, this is still a more worthwhile film overall than one might expect.",Final Destination 2

Cook who plays as Kimberly Corman a girl who had a bad vision in a highway and she blocks the freeway and save a few others who were meant to die. And the story continues with all the survivors dying one by one and Kimberly Corman tries to stop it before it was to late and her turn come.I liked this movie and I think we can compare it with the first one which was equally good with this one, and the only difference which I can find is that in the first movie I could not predict anything but in this movie some things you can predict because you have seen the first.",Final Destination 2
43,Floated2,"Poorly Written, Lacking Originality",5,12 June 2013,"The first movie took the time to follow teen horror flick conventions, to develop characters -as thin as they were - and to throw in some theories about why all these people were dying. In the second movie, all these time-fillers are skipped and the movie becomes a heaping helping of mind-boggling mayhem. Final Destination 2 asks why it should bother with the parsley of plot, dialogue, or characters, when people just want a plateful of death.In many ways, tunneling all of the sequel's energies into a smorgasbord of imaginative deaths works better than the heavy-handed ""suspense"" of the original film. The acting is mediocre at best. Do they solve the riddle in time? Few will care, considering that there is no reason to like any of the characters and the main thrill of the movie comes from the elaborate nature of the deadly accidents. If this movie is supposed to be a scary thriller, then it flies far of the mark. If, however, Final Destination 2 seeks to take us no further than bloody spectacle, then it does a fine job indeed.
==
As a rewatch 12/10/18' Final Destination isn't completely as bad as remembered. Over five years since the original viewing, much remembered had been forgotten save for some scenes. Nothing too memorable about this film in comparison to the original. We can see as to why audiences preferred the original, with a main reason being the cast was more likable and easier to root for. Though this film,the death scenes and overall deaths are far more gruesome and violent.There is a different atmosphere here, as the film seems more serious, though filled with more noticeable silly dialogue. Overall Final Destination 2 isn't bad for what's it worth, as there are still several scenes of suspense, thrills and overall excitement. Rating changed from 3 to 5. As another rewatch 03/11/20' opinions remain same. There are some clever and good moments but as a whole, the original is superior.",Final Destination 2
44,pmtelefon,Gory fun,8,8 April 2020,"""Final Destination 2"" is a lot of fun. It's good as a sequel or as a stand alone movie. The cast is good and they all do a nice job but this movie is all about the Rube Goldberg type death scenes. They are all very clever and fun. ""Final Destination 2"" is a solid entry in a surprisingly entertaining franchise. Honorable mention: a dreamy A.J. Cook.",Final Destination 2
45,insomniac_rod,Entertaining... Nothing more or less.,6,2 December 2006,"""Final Destination 2"" offers many things but only gives a few of them and in regular quality. The premise of the movie is pretty good and actually, the violent premonition sequence was great; a violent scene full of action. After the premise, I had my expectations raised from low to medium; but after some cheesy scenes and dialogs I understood that this sequel wasn't necessary and that I was watching a big budget ""Horror"" movie that looked like a direct for video b-flick. Also, ""Final Destination"" has voluntary and involuntary black humor. When you consider taking the movie seriously, some scenes make you change your mind quickly. Watch the ending and you will give me the reason.Sure, the movie is very entertaining and manages somehow to get your attention but when you are really into the movie; it lets you down because it isn't as consistent as wanted. I mean, there aren't enough ""strong"" scenes to get you hooked on through the entire movie. Most of the death scenes were really inventive and creative, but also some of them were truly ""unbelievable"" or not real enough. Still, I accept that as a movie, ""Final Destination 2"" tries to impress and shock the audience with fantasy scenes. The acting is very good. A.J. Cook is extremely beautiful but manages to deliver a solid, believable performance. She was just too cute to be harmed. The same goes for Connor.. She was very fragile, beautiful, but delivered a fine performance. The rest of the clichèd characters are well portrayed. The though black guy, the junkie, the loving mother and her son, and the lottery winner were all likable characters. The f/x are actually very, very good. The CGI is well used and not abused. That's something good for a movie like this. True; some scenes look very cheesy but the CGI is only used in regular amounts.So I would recommend ""Final Destination 2"" for people who liked the original FD and for people who want to have mindless entertainment. This movie gave me the feeling of a B-flick and I can't say I didn't like it; because at least it entertained me for a while. Watch it with low, low expectations.",Final Destination 2
46,videorama-759-859391,"One of those successful sequels, that should now make it's final destination",8,15 July 2014,"If fans of FD 1, here's a sequel that humbly satisfies and this one's bloody, the violence sometimes in nasty and cruel taste. This one sees a terrifying chain reaction, murder pile up on a highway, and you guessed it, the lucky survivors, a group of drug/sex crazed teens of today's generation, save for the head of the group, a much more responsible chick, Kimberly, plus others, are the ones who must pay for cheating death. This includes lotto winner, Evan, where his chain of events, leading to a gruesome demise are simply ironic. This is as much fun as the first film, if more, where again the franchise here, didn't know when to stop. Kimberly seeks answers from the only survivor, Crystal (Ali Larter) of the first, who's barricaded herself away in a cell in a mental facility, from which she should of stayed. Too here, we have a different path of death which made for an interesting twist. FD 2 doesn't let go of the fear factor either, the inescapable of the survivors who try to challenge it, instead of burrowing themselves away in a psycho cell, which as referring to the original, put a cruel and nasty spin on. And in a finale, again, you better keep your guard, up too. When will people learn too, never to light up at a servo.",Final Destination 2
47,taylorkingston,A great sequel...,10,18 October 2014,"I really like this movie. It didn't get a great rating or great reviews, and I honestly don't know why. I think it's a great movie and a great sequel to Final Destination. It sort of continues from the first one, using the first movies experiences and characters.In this movie, we have another disaster. This time, instead of a plane crash, it's a freeway pile- up. Kimberly and her friends are all going away for the weekend. They're driving down the highway and see all of these ironic things. Like a man driving a ""drink responsibly"" truck, whilst drinking alcohol. That's smart. We see all of these seemingly insignificant characters, and then they all die horribly and vividly in a highway crash. Then Kimberly wakes up from what just happened. She's confused, understandably, and notices everything that happened in her vision is coming true. Like the songs on the radio and other drivers. Then, before she pulls onto the highway, she stops. And doesn't get on. The people behind her, who were destined to die, also couldn't get on, with her blocking them. The the pile-up happens. And sadly, Kimberly's friends die. She tries to explain to survivors that she had a vision and of course, no one believes her. Then she goes to see Clear Rivers from Final Destination. She had checked herself into an insane asylum, for her own protection. We hear how Alex had died recently, and that's why she's in there. So she won't get hurt. She explains to Kimberly that her friends died the exact same order, as they would've on the flight. They realize that Kimberly's friends died last in her vision, but first in real life. Death is working backwards. She gathers the other survivors and she explains. Everyone is trying to keep safe, but sadly, Death doesn't give up that easily.Overall, I give this movie a 10 out of 10.",Final Destination 2
48,GOWBTW,Picks up where we left off,8,5 May 2005,"This movie picks up where the last movie left off. I'm surprised that Alex was killed off in part 2. A falling brick? From where? And Clear Rivers(Ali Lauter) institutionalized herself after Alex's death. And the aborted traffic fatality for Kimberly(AJ Cook) took a whole new meaning for this movie. The one year anniversary of the 180 crash, started a whole new phenomena for different people. There's were other survivors that the first movie never mentioned. And the events from the first movie plays a role in the sequel which gives the term a whole new meaning. Eugene Dix(T.C. Carson of ""Living Single"" and Living Large"") was almost like Carter from the first FD. And the junkie in the Mustang prepared himself perfectly when the explosion occurred. It was gruesome when the traffic accident first occurred when the log truck knocked the trooper's head off. And all the other pileups follow through. A whole new story, the same old consequences, is there a possibility for a FD3? We shall see about that. Rating 3 out of 5 stars.",Final Destination 2
49,jtindahouse,Creativity Outstanding!!!,10,6 September 2004,"The originality and creativity of this film are just outstanding! When I walked out of the theatre I had that tingly feeling you get when you know you've just seen something special. The ideas of how the people died were just amazing. My personal favourite would have to be the one where they've just had the car crash and that girl is sitting in the front seat of the car waiting for the fire man to get the door off so she can get out. From the crash there had been a big, sharp, metal poll sticking through the back of her seat which had just missed her head so she's thinking she's real lucky. But then when the fire man gets the door the air bag comes up and when they pull it down you just see the poll sticking through her head.

50,dee.reid,A trip that's still worth taking. 9/10,9,18 September 2003,"In a number of ways, the sequel to 2000's surprise hit is a better-made, not necessarily better film than the first one.  It takes the ideas from the first film and builds on them.  While the first movie actually scared you, this one is more in it for shock value.  Yet that doesn't make it bad because you admire the craft that's gone into it.  ""Final Destination 2"" is unique amongst horror films in being that it has a unique villain (or hero?)  Death.  The movies are philosophical in being that they ask an ages old question: Is there any way to beat death?  Of course there is no way to beat death but according to the movies, if you recognize the signs or patterns that Death is willing to show you, it can be beaten.  The real truth is that Death has a really sadistic sense of humor in that it likes to toy with its victims before finally taking them.  It likes to trick its victims into thinking that it can be beaten, but the truth is that in the end, no one escapes Death; the only thing you can do really is delay it.  I think the ""Final Destination"" films are not really horror movies, but really dark satires that show how people react under extreme distress. ""FD2"" is also unique in its portrayal of the characters.  In my opinion, Death is not the villain, but it's the characters themselves.  The characters go to these absurd lengths to try to cheat Death, knowing that they can't.  They and Death go to extreme lengths to outwit one another, but Death always comes out on top.  The people need to just learn you can't cheat Death, because when your number's up, it's up.",Final Destination 2

55,drownnnsoda,"Same Concept, New Characters, New Deaths.",7,27 August 2006,"""Final Destination 2"" is very similar to it's original counterpart, with the exact same concept, with some more creative deaths and new characters. The film is about a teenage girl named Kimbery (AJ Cook), who is your normal teenager. While driving with some friends on a highway, she has a premonition of a horrible pileup after a log truck loses it's lumber, killing her and many others. Quickly thinking, she blocks up the freeway, stopping a handful of strangers who would have died from cruising into death's arms. But when the people she miraculously saved from death begin to die in odd ways, it seems that Death is coming back for them. After seeking help from Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), who is now contained in a mental hospital, fearing that Death is still out to get her, it's up to Kimberly to keep all of those who she saved from dying. But is it really possible to cheat your way out of death? Unfortunately, for this unlucky slew of people, it isn't. This film has the same premise as the original, this time the horrible event being a major highway accident (and our hero is a female) and introduces some new characters who are next to fall in Death's arms. There isn't a lot to say about the story really, since it is so similar to the original, so I'll focus on the deaths in the film. This time around, the inventive death sequences are even more clever and complicated, and much bloodier and shocking than the original film. The most memorable deaths would have to be the one at the dentist's office and the one at the farm field, the ideas the writers came up with were so creative it was surreal. The actors this time around were all good, and Ali Larter reprised her role as Clear, who sadly meets a grim fate near the film's conclusion (which this time was also left open for another sequel).Overall, ""Final Destination 2"" is worth seeing just for it's extremely creative ways that it picks off the characters one by one. There are some extremely memorable moments throughout, and the movie was enjoyable for the most part. Definitely see it if you enjoyed the original, it's a good follow-up.",Final Destination 2

57,aidanratesmovies,"You can't cheat death twice, but you can cheat it 5 times",5,1 September 2021,"Campy, silly, and rather entertaining- Final Destination 2 can often just feel like a rehash of the first flick- but at times it does manage to have some good ideas- even if they aren't executed very well. I like some of the elements of this film. The look is well developed, and all the actors do try their best. The opening of the film is a bit predictable, but I like the concept, and found it to be an interesting point to start off on nevertheless. The film does seem to bend the rules a little as well, in order to further develop its plot, and honestly the film itself is incredibly imitative of the first- so it's not hard to spot what is coming next. The deaths can often be kinda silly, and much of the logic doesn't make any sense. Some of the writing can be redundant, or just plain stupid, but you oddly feel invested in these characters one way or another thanks to the actors giving it their all- even though we all know its incredibly stupid. In the end, Final Destination 2 is not much of a sequel- but it has its purely fun moments. If you are looking for depth, you certainly won't find it here, but fans of the original and other cheesy horror flicks may have themselves quite a blast.My Rating: 5.2/10.",Final Destination 2

This wasn't a sequel in the purest sense, but the film makers created methods to link all of the new characters to the old ones, creating a flow which wasn't too jarring. Unfortunately, the dialogue was the only real stinker in this film. The pretentiousness, the obviousness and the downright hokiness that came out of the mouths of the characters really detracted from the tension, turning their performances into a bunch of acting class rejects. But I digress. The only thing people are looking for is how Death will get the new set of escape artists. The sheer surprise and execution of the executions made me jump and crawl. In such a desensitized world we live in, being able to jump out of my seat means this film is a winner.",Final Destination 2

The accident happens, but all the people she prevented from entering the road, including herself, seem cursed to die to by violent freak accidents.This is a very stupid movie whose only purpose is to set the characters up to get smooshed in bizarre and icky circumstances. We have people impaled in the head by ladders, beheaded by elevators, blown up at barbecues, sliced up by netting, and so on. Call me old-fashioned, but I like a movie to have a plot and characters I can get interested in. The cast of catalogue-models are uniformly wooden, except for the ever-reliable Todd, who provides a few minutes' sinister grace. The digital effects for the short-and-sudden deaths are quite imaginative but not really very interesting or plausible - people just liquefy into computer goo and they're over in about ten frames. I much prefer the good old prosthetic latex approach, which is gorier and more realistic (see Scanners, The Fury, Day Of The Dead, Robocop, etc). There is a nice score by Shirley Walker which creates some suspense, the opening highway pile-up has some great stuntwork and most of the characters have horror-film director names. However, this indicates the golden rule of film-making - if what's on the page is lame, the movie will always be a turkey.",Final Destination 2

What they did with 'Final Destination 2' reminded me a little of what they did with 'Hannibal'. Just more blood and gore. I must say, especially in the first half hour, it works. The opening sequence looks great and bloody and when the first survivor finds his death you heard a lot of 'aaargh' in the theater. Probably what the makers had in mind. After this it gets a little boring and very much the same and of course totally stupid, but I was entertained, sort of.There are some terrific scenes here. Not because they are that great but because they work exactly the way she should. One in particular that involves a dentist made the theater pretty noisy. There is some space for comedy moments as well, making this a nice film. Not as good, if that is the term, as the original, but it works well enough to give it a try.",Final Destination 2

It is a sequel just for the sake of money, but after franchises such as Saw, it doesn't seem so bad. We came here for ridiculous deaths and that's certainly what we get. The biggest problem is the amount of characters. Like all horror films, it feels as though it must up the ante. Unfortunately with more and more deaths, each death has less impact. We don't know nor care for the characters, and there is less build up to each death. Here, the characters spend too long looking for clues with no real way of stopping the deaths thus making the whole vision thing rather redundant. AT least this film tried to be inventive with the kills, and expand on the story in some way.",Final Destination 2

The rest of the movie is just more deaths, done in various clever ways. One, involving a boy and a piece of plate glass, is the film's best killing. Ali Larter is back from the first movie, as that film's sole survivor. While she has little to do, her presence allows for a direct connection to the first film. The main reason for seeing this movie is the car pileup. It is amazing, and I haven't the slightest idea how they filmed some of it, other than to assume it must have taken a week to shoot. Gorehounds may enjoy some of the killings in this bloody flick, but it doesn't begin to approach the SAW series for true gore. It is more in keeping with THE OMEN in that sense.

While in the first the deaths were only seen before the big accident, in this one there's a girl with premonitions of deaths even further, doing justice to it's Brazilian translation-- which is simply ""Premonition"". I just have a big problem with these explosions; making things explode in real life isn't that easy... in this film, any minimum bug makes the whole thing explode, which makes it lose some plausibility. And I have to complain the fact that Brazilian DVD has this subtitles very slow and out of time... I was obligated to see it without subtitles and ended up losing some informations.

Admittedly, on the face of it, that is what you get. But FD2 takes things a step further by showing that the events of the second film take place because of the events of the first film. They are connected far more deeply than simply being ""another batch of people that escape death"".The effects are well done and striking, as in the first movie, this time focusing on a road accident rather than an air crash. And, of course, death's efforts to ""put things right"" by offing those that escaped the road accident are the usual level of weird and seemingly impossible twists of chance that we grew used to in the first movie.Although I welcomed the plot development, linking this movie to the first one, the whole movie was never scary, as such. It's plenty gruesome enough (see the barbed wire scene, for example), but not very frightening. After some thought, I think this is in part due to the fact that I have recently been watching the series ""Dead Like Me"". Every time in the movie that things seemed to take on a life of their own, I was imagining Gravelings prodding and tinkering. It kind of ruined any suspense that might have been in the moment.However, the movie is a worthy sequel to the first. Not necessarily better, just worthy of the name. Again this is mostly due to the fact that it progressed the story a little, rather than simply cashing in on the first's success.If you liked the first movie, this one won't disappoint.",Final Destination 2
66,lewiskendell,Ever seem someone crushed under a pane of glass? Would you like to?,6,7 August 2010,"""That's why death is working backwards. It's tying up all the loose ends. Sealing the rift once and for all.""Yep, when a movie has dialogue that silly, you expect it to be pretty ridiculous. And that's exactly what Final Destination 2 is. It's even more over-the-top than the original movie was. A new group of people once again escape death in a huge accident, only to face further absurdly elaborate attempts on their lives. The death scenarios were all pretty entertaining, and if you weren't tired of the formula after the first movie, you'll probably enjoy the escalated efforts of this second installment. It's literally just more of the same, but guessing how each person is going to die is the kind of light entertainment that just doesn't get old, for me.",Final Destination 2
67,vengeance20,An Ace Sequel!,9,11 January 2013,"Seeing this was pretty good! It was very well put together!The opening was good explaining the events from the first film! The motorway disaster was epic! The Explosions, the Gore & the Destruction was top notch!The deaths were pretty good! Evans Death especially! How everything went together perfectly! The omens were good too! The Ladder impaling his eye was just well done!The other deaths were good like Tim Death with the dentist chair & the glass pane crushing him! But the deaths suffered the whole Buildup suspense pattern! They were like the first one too quick & over in seconds! But they were good! How they referred to how the cheated death the first time & how in the first film they caused a rift in deaths design & if not one of them (The cast from the first Final Destination) had died, then they wouldn't have lived as their deaths had an effect on theirs lives too! Just clever!A pretty good sequel! 9/10",Final Destination 2
68,moviewizguy,There's Going to be a Huge Accident!,7,18 March 2006,"This film is about Kimberly and her friends going to take the time off and spend their time going on a vacation. She drives the car and sees disturbing things that hints as a car accident. A truck is carrying logs in which the logs slides on the street killing many people in a gruesome pile up. While Kimberly and her friends are on the ground, in the car, another big truck, filled with flames, goes to her and before it crashes, Kimberly wakes up in a vivid dream.She blocks the road so the cars behind her wouldn't go. An officer spots this and questions why she's doing this. She tries to explain she had a dream that a pile up just happened. Then before long, the truck with the logs kill the other cars in the highway. She saves 10 people for that but three of her friends automatically dies at the beginning where another car crashes into them. Now 7, including Kimberly, are left. Suddenly, the survivors get killed one by one by gruesome accidents. Now Kimberly has to find a way to stop this before Death kills her.If you haven't noticed, this film has the exact same concept and plot in this movie as its original. On the contrary, it doesn't take itself too seriously, much funnier, smarter, and more elaborate and gruesome deaths. It's much lighter. Well, yeah, there are a few weeping scenes but I think this film was made to entertain the audience and not tire them with the over dramatic scenes.This film takes place one year from the original. The deaths, as stated above, are more elaborate and gruesome, which makes the film better. The clues that foreshadow each death are now more elaborate and I love the score in here, which is even more brooding and suspenseful than the one in the original that this film is even more thrilling. I acting by A.J. Cook is great.Basically, this film puts everything up a notch: The death, the premonition sequence (which has probably the best car accident scenes you'll ever see in your entire life!), the much needed humor, the intelligence, more characters to love, etc. I would call this a guilty pleasure and I love it THAT much! See the movie if you don't care if it's a repeat of the original.",Final Destination 2
69,Luigi Di Pilla,One of the best sequels ever made,8,22 November 2003,"Fasten your seat belt when you watch this. Wow, it keeps you dead or alive. Congratulations to the director and all the stuff.  The special effects were really cool and the soundtrack was perfect.  Finally I and my wife saw since long time a well directed movie with many plots and twists and lot of mystery. Please watch it only if you can digest some brutal bloody scenes. I mean it's not the usual ghost horror film that makes scary someone and then kills the victim with a knife. No, not at all; the story is built up in a very intelligent way with many puzzles to solve as in the first one. I recommend you to see the first one before to watch the second part. A must see. Definitively one of the best sequels I have ever seen. Score: 8/10.",Final Destination 2
70,uds3,A sequel that delivers......death!,8,15 March 2003,"Brian Collins of Tipperary NAILED it!  ""The makers are giving the audience what they want!""   Yes they are!  Stupid? yeah, it is!  so was the first! Intellectually stimulating?  about as much so as ""Judge Judy!"" An entertaining movie?  Hell Yes!Dumbass comments like ""All they did was rip off the first one!""  Er thats what everyone went to see it for...hoping they DID!""   They did it better too!  Listen guys if this type of flick ain't your thing...why the hell go and see it?  If you don't want to be confronted by gross-out deaths - go and watch LILO and STITCH, MILO AND OTIS...LAUREL AND HARDY!  Personally, I LOVE gross-out deaths and this little flick DELIVERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!The flick is worth seeing for the freeway accident alone. Arguably the most horrific thing ever seen in a movie bar NONE! I have never been a fan of laughable CGI fx.....this sequence however is as good as you're ever likely to see. It has the power to shut down an audiences senses just temporarily. Some people could be extremely upset and feel emotionally violated by this incredible piece of freeway violence.  If you thought the ""bus sequence"" was scary in the first - close your eyes here! I tend to agree that the film got sillier as it went on but the sheer creativity of the cast's demise held it together. A.J. Cook was quite excellent (and believable) as Kimberly...Ali Larter really was little more than padding and in the upshot hardly even relevant to the film. Why she receives top billing is a mystery?  I also concede the repetitious attempts to link it to the first one grated after a while. The film and story hold up perfectly well on their own.Question! HOW did the cast and crew keep a straight face when Kimberly delivered the all time classic line, ""They're gonna be attacked by a flock of pigeons?"" I'd knock a star off too for the inappropriate and unnecessarily comical ending!",Final Destination 2
71,mjw2305,"Same Concept, Different Story, Good Result",7,2 January 2007,"Final Destination 2 uses exactly the same formula that worked the first time (so be warned if you didn't like the fist one you won't like this)The story is slightly different and manages to tie all the new characters into the characters from the first film and it does it well. The death scenes are better in this one, but the freshness is slightly tainted as you would expect from a sequel. Once again it is well cast and has a good script with the traditional sprinkle of cheese for the teen horror genre.Great sequel in every way and its damn close to being as good as the first film.7/10",Final Destination 2
72,rivertam26,Superior film to the original,9,18 July 2020,"This really surprised me. Initially when I first saw it I thought there was no way they'd be able to do a sequel. This one in my opinion is the best of the bunch. It all starts off with the most insane scene ever. A giant accident on the highway that's let's the audience know all the different ways you can die. Like the first someone has a vision but this time around it's a young woman who ends up stopping traffic and saves a group of strangers who of course begin to die in the spectacularly gruesome ways. The death setpieces are ridiculously impressive a combination of practical and digital effects. My favorite has to be the glass kill but all of them are remarkable and hella shocking. The movie unlike the original doesn't take itself seriously and neither should you but it also impressively lays out a complex twist that brings it all together. A superior film to the first with solid performances all around.Budget: $26M
Box Office: $90.4M8.5/10",Final Destination 2
73,Screen_Blitz,Not too bad of a sequel,5,19 July 2015,"Final Destination 2 is a sequel to the 2000 hit that left many people skeptical of going on a plane ride, set with a new set of characters. This time around involves Kimberly Corman (played by A.J Cook), who sets on a vacation with her friends to Daytona Beach. Like Devon Sawa's character in the first film, Kimberly has a terrifying premonition of her friends and everyone around dying in a horrific disaster, only this disaster a massive car pile-up that leads to a number of deaths. Kimberly intervenes and saves the lives of many (not all) people on the highway. However, she soon learns that Death still has the lives of the individuals she saved on it's agenda. She teams up with Thomas Burke (played by Michael Burke) and Clears Rivers (played by Ali Larter), who revives from the first film, in attempt to save them.This film carries roughly the same story structure as the first film, with an opening disaster and the people getting killed in strange accidents. However, I didn't this one to be as realistic as the first one. Some of the deaths in this film were okay, others were a bit too laughable. The deaths that occur during the massive car crash scene at the beginning were quite good and surprisingly realistic. Secondly, the characters are a bit underdeveloped. Unlike the other films, each of the characters do not have any unique personalities. In the others films, you had the jock, the geek, the hot girl, and all the other character stereotypes. This film didn't have these and made the characters incomprehensible.The good part of this film is the plot. The film moves a decent pace and has its moments of suspense. The climax towards the end was my favorite part of the movie. What I also liked how it connected with the first film, especially having Clear from the previous film return as the character who is incarcerated in a mental institution to protect herself from Death. Overall, this movie isn't a total letdown. It just not as good as the first.",Final Destination 2
74,xredgarnetx,Interesting first half,6,18 January 2006,"I may have written a review of this under my previous moniker. Watching FINAL DESTINATION 2 again the other day, I am again struck by the highway pileup, which appeared to have been largely physical gags and not a heck of a lot of CGI. It is probably the best highway accident scene I have ever seen in a movie, although a couple of others come close, including the ending of 2002's TRAPPED with Kevin Bacon and Charlize Theron. The second half of this so-called sequel sucks, plain and simple. There are a couple of very gory deaths that look as fake as they come, and appear to be right out of an OMEN movie. The most offensive is probably the plate glass falling onto the kid. Without even slowing down the action, you can plainly see the glass hitting what appears to be the bottom half of a dummy filled with stage blood. Ali Larter's cartoonish flaming, flying death near the end is almost as bad. I love gore in movies, but only when it is handled realistically. The very first death after the highway scene, involving the goofy guy who has just won the lottery, is actually the most interesting to watch as it plays out like a slapstick routine that Steve Martin or Jim Carrey or even Lou Costello might have performed. The director may have thought he was making a comedy because you certainly can't take this movie seriously. And to think a second sequel is about to come out. Heaven help us! Where's Damien when you need him? Couldn't they at least have Death from FAMILY GUY make a guest appearance?",Final Destination 2
75,Maciste_Brother,Bad acting and silly execution of an interesting concept,2,25 January 2005,"Except for the lovely A.J. Cook, every actor in FINAL DESTINATION 2 shouldn't quit their day job. Oy! If you want to see a movie with a lot of bad acting, check out FINAL DESTINATION 2.The story is interesting (I didn't see the first film) but it's done like a TV movie-of-the-week way, which is unfortunate because for a story like this to work, it needs a lot of style. The film is as stylish as a pampers commercial.A lot of gorehounds have praised this movie for the amount of bloody action in it and I have to say that's it's good to see some actual violence after watching so many bloodless PG-13 so-called horror films. But the amount gore got boring very quickly. It just became a tad ridiculous after a while. The whole movie became ridiculous by the last hour.Not horrendous but not that good either and I don't expect to watch it again.",Final Destination 2
76,gedikreverdi,You can cheat death,6,21 July 2021,I liked the pace. The opening scene the truck with giant logs was very good. I felt sad when Ali Larter's character died in the explosion at the hospital with the black guy. The plot about how they affected everyone they somehow contacted after they were supposed to be dead. The mother and the son's deaths were impressive. The pigeons and the glass dropped on the boy and the mother got stuck in between the elevator and the wall and got beheaded. The annoying woman was impaled with a pipe after the airbag went off when she was stuck in the car with a log in the car. The farmer young boy who was saved from being hit by the car died when the barbecue exploded at the end of the movie. The pregnant lady gave birth but the new life didn't stop deaths because she wasn't going to die in the accident on the highway to Hell. So Kimberly crushed into the lake with a van on purpose in order to be brought back from death by the nurse from the hospital. Then she survived with the police officer and they cheated death. The CGI wasn't good at times and some of the deaths weren't natural at all like the black guy in the hospital room and things are moving around without any reason at all. In the first film everything happened for a reason as if it is the natural process. All in all it was rather entertaining but I don't thing it's as good as the first although it's more fast-paced than the first film so I rated it 6 like the first one.,Final Destination 2
77,baumer,Better than the first,8,23 April 2007,"I was stunned when I saw FINAL DESTINATION. It was a shocking and horrifically tense film that has images in that i had never seen before. A plane blew up right in front of your eyes, some lost their heads and death, in this case a noun, was after everyone, and it was unstoppable. It was a perfectly crafted horror film that I didn't think could be topped.I was wrong. Not only is FINAL DESTINATION 2 a scarier and more gory film, it is a better made film that it's predecessor. I commented that Final Destination had the scariest 15 minutes to open a film perhaps ever. And although that may still be true, the opening highway sequence is at least as scary. And it is also one of the best directed scenes in the history of film. You can put this up there with the truck chase in RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, the chase scene in BULLIT and the final lightsabre duel with Darth and Luke in RETURN OF THE JEDI. David R. ELLIS is a gifted director and perhaps that is why I enjoyed SNAKES ON A PLANE so much. He has an innate ability to milk a scene for everything it's worth and the opening 15 minutes of this film is the epitome of brilliance. It not only sets the tone for the rest of the film but by the time the last word is uttered in the scene, you're exhausted and exhilarated. I can't heap enough praise on this scene.After you get past the opening sequence of the film, what must be marveled at is the story. Critics will tell you that the best sequels are films that further the story, not just retell it like the way a film like Friday THE 13TH PART 2 does. Final Destination 2 has one of the wildest stories and best continuations of any film ever. Excluding EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and perhaps ROCKY II, you won't find a better continuation of a story than you will here. This film connects the events from the first to the characters in the second. They are literally running from death because they should have and would have been affected by the chain of events in the original had the passengers not gotten off the plane. J. Gruber and Eric Hess devised a well thought out and brilliantly complex story line for this one that will send a chill through you.And finally what must be mentioned is the creative deaths in the film. In today's horror climate where gore has made a successful comeback thanks to films like Saw and Final Destination, this one has some very strong and graphic images that will please all gore hounds. The special effects team and the CGI guys should be commended for their innovation. Watching someone get cut in two with wires is quite the thrill....as long as it's in the movies of course.Finally, Ali Larter appears in here as well and it's great to see her character survive from the first. She is wonderful in here as well.Final Destination 2 is a fantastic film and it surpasses the quality of the first. This is a great addition to the horror genre.8.5/10",Final Destination 2
78,DunnDeeDaGreat,Good non horror sequel,6,1 February 2003,Final Destination 2 proved something that most horror film sequels can't. If a scary movie sequel is full of laughs it can be fun. The film is full of good acting in particular A.J. Cook who carrys her first starring role very well. Tony Todd makes another chilling cameo and Ali Larter also does another good job. I hope this isn't the last Destination for the series. I give it *** stars based soley on the death sequences. The film is lot of fun and I can't wait to see it again.,Final Destination 2
79,NijazBaBs,bit better than 1st sequel,7,28 January 2020,"I liked that graphical effects were bit better than in 1st sequel. But all together it deserves same rating. For example there are holes in the story, not completely explained, unreliable, and not completed. More like some movie with bit of fun, jokes, graphics, and luck. Too random. Can't get better rating but also can't get worse rating.",Final Destination 2
80,hnt_dnl,FD2 is my favorite FD sequel!,8,14 April 2012,"Film franchises have become a sort of curiosity for me. Like how a new film concept comes out with an original idea and somehow it blossoms into a popular series. The Saw movies are the first ones I noticed this happening with, where the first movie was so beloved and such a surprise hit that it demanded a flurry of sequels. Harry Potter and Twilight seemed more like ""planned"" franchises, while Saw was a surprise. In the vein of Saw is the FINAL DESTINATION series of movies, of which I find a major guilty pleasure! While I still think the first one is the best, I really enjoyed this 2nd film in the series FINAL DESTINATION 2 (2003), which ironically seems to be overlooked amongst the sequels, but favor it over 3, 4, or 5, actually.The first FD had a creepy horror movie gravitas that still to this day makes it the best of the series that really none of the sequels have been able to emulate. I felt like FD3 was a bit too serious and except for the leads, none of the other characters involved me like in FD1. FD4 was pure parody and juvenile, but still oddly entertaining in it's awfulness! FD5 was actually very good and I might put that one right behind FD2. I like FD2 mainly because I think it does the best job of capturing the spirit of the original FD, while having a welcome sense of humor and a wonderful ensemble cast with a lot of personality! I think of all the FD movies, I actually like the FD2 ensemble the best!The leads A.J. Cook, Michael Landes, and Ali Larter (from FD1) are engaging, with Larter's presence tying things together nicely between FD1 and FD2. Cook and Larter are very personable (and extremely attractive!), while Landes is stalwart and reliable. The supporting cast steals the show, though! Jonathan Cherry (as dimwitted dope addict Rory), Keegan Connor Tracy (as vain, vampy businesswoman Kat), T.C. Carson (as wisecracking non-believer Eugene), James Kirk (as teenager Tim), Lynda Boyd (as Tim's mom) are all likable characters that I find myself rooting for even though I know what's in store for them! FD2 kind of sets the stage for all other sequels being more action-oriented than the original. The series became more about characters trying to beat death than accepting their fate or just generally being creeped out, like they were in FD1. Of course, the iconic Tony Todd makes another appearance as the caretaker from hell! The first half sets the stage, while the second half really gets going when the ensemble must converge to beat death. Highly entertaining sequel!",Final Destination 2
81,Fernando-Rodrigues,They cheated death. But for how long?,7,21 August 2021,"Final Destination became the movie of inventive deaths. Any depth here is unnecessary, there always are solutions (and ambiguities as well), the ""messages"" of death are increasingly implicit, and fun is guaranteed.",Final Destination 2
82,CharltonBoy,Suprisingly good,7,9 March 2004,What a pleasant suprise this film was.Having seen the first film and having been underwhelmed by it this had a different affect.Although the story is no different from the first the manner in which the people die are refreshingly gory and imaginative .If that makes sense! There are some questions that are left unanswered and there are holes in the plot but thanks to the gore factor these do not matter. The acting is above average and the special affect are good. The blood count is high as it should be in a film like this. I would recommend this to any horror fan. 7 out of 10.,Final Destination 2
83,carbuff,"Strong sequel, but still not the original.",7,31 July 2019,"You discover that ""Final Denstination 1"" is woven into ""Final Destination 2"" as the latter film moves along. It doesn't have quite the acting chops or the plot twists of the original, but it is more gruesome--more horror, less emotion. Still, binge watching the first three ""Final Destinations"" is a fine way to kill time, although they go down in quality with each remake. I don't like to put true spoilers in my reviews, so I don't want to say anything except that this picks up some of the older characters and plot lines to go in a very different direction with a weaker but still workable plot and decent-enough actors. Nothing great here, but no time-numbing waste of time either. Good, not great film.",Final Destination 2
84,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,How can you have more than one FINAL destination? hmm....,7,5 June 2004,"I guess Hollywood says you can. And here it is. Final Destination 2.It is basically the same thing all over again. But it is bigger, bloodier, and the initial accident sequence is AWESOME! Car crashes are rarely put on film so explosively! So intricately! With such careful choreography! It is really great metal crunching action.However a good opening doesn't make up for the lack of this film's originality. But it does provide good entertainment, especially if you enjoyed the first and don't my some repetition every once in a while.The story is technically a continuation of the first, but that is almost totally overshadowed by the death scenes and the characters trying to survive...which is just like the first movie. 6/10",Final Destination 2

86,deatman9,A great sequel,7,17 October 2012,"I really liked the first Final Destination movie and I think this one blew it out of the water. I have to say some of actors are pretty bad but the idea is fun and they always think of new crazy ways to kill people.This movie is about a young girl who has a vision on a highway that ultamitly ends up saving a few peoples lives. They are all grateful to be alive but soon end up dieing one by one as they think something didn't want them to survive in the first place.This was a very solid sequel, really entertaining and fun to watch.

Sure, Kimberly's visions make no sense, still there's the Candyman-guy who is Mr. Know-it-all without explanation. Who cares? The story convinces, there is a great connection to part 1 and the deaths, oh boy, the deaths are original and gory. You don't find that kind of stuff in slasher horror movies. The movie was a great roller coaster ride. They're gonna make a third part? Count me in!",Final Destination 2
88,acidburn-10,Awesome follow up,8,7 June 2012,"I remember when I saw the first Final Destination movie at the cinema, and I really enjoyed it, it was something fresh new original and exciting, and when I heard that they were making a 2nd one, well at first I was a bit sceptical, but when I saw the trailers, I was excited.Well the plot to this one, not all that different from the previous movie, only instead of an aeroplane, this time we get a traffic accident and the central character Kimberley (AJ Cook) has a vision much like Devon Sawa did in the first one. Only with a slight difference, this time the deaths work backwards.Sequels are often associated with disappointment, as many often only manage to be pale imitations of their predecessors. The second Final Destination is anything but, as it's bigger, slicker, and altogether more fun than the original. Overall this one has a different tone to the first one, this one's more blood and a lot more gore, which is always a bonus in my eyes, another aspect is that the deaths are way over the top, which is awesome and something that was missing from the first movie.The performances again doesn't fail to deliver, with yet again another group of interesting characters, AJ Cook is this time the main character and she hits all the right notes, she's resourceful and likable. Michael Landes plays it cool and low key but also comes across as likable and has great chemistry with AJ Cook. Ali Larter I enjoyed her in the first movie and I was glad they brought her back she gave a very credible performance and Jonathan Cherry plays the comic relief drug addict really well and came off as very natural.All in all a brilliant follow up and companion to the first movie and them both even each other out really well.",Final Destination 2

90,Rickting,Simple but effective,6,14 February 2015,"Most film reviewers probably have an anomaly; a film or film series which they shouldn't like but do. The Final Destination films are mine. While the acting and writing are painful at times, the premise is intelligent and they're more effective than they're given credit for. Final Destination 2 sees a wimpy young woman(Alex Browning she ain't) foresee a hideous car pile up. She stops various people who were meant to die from getting onto the road, but death is not happy and soon starts claiming their lives in gruesome, gory Rube Goldberg machine style freak accidents. Gore hounds, you've met your match. This is weaker than it's highly underrated predecessor and is the 2nd worst in the franchise, although it's certainly not a bad film. The FD flicks were my first horror films and I used to be a big fan. I'm not as big a fan now, but they still hold up. FD 2 is not a scary film, but with a scare tool box of a log truck, a ladder, a window, a lift, a pipe, barbed wire, hospital equipment and a barbecue it is a surprisingly effective film. With it's dark atmosphere and suspenseful tone, you will be on the edge of your seat throughout.The thing which lets FD 2 down is the acting, which is awful. Ali Larter has improved a bit, Tony Todd is in full on creepy mode (In a good way) and 2 of the survivors, a stoner and a high school teacher, and reasonably well played. However, AJ Cook is a terrible lead, and most of the other acting performances are awful. Even though these people are seeing things which would traumatize a person for life, they look like they're watching Halloween cartoon for kids. The script is weak, with a lot of exposition and the characters in general aren't as likable as the survivors in the first film. The writing, acting and predictability of the plot weigh this down, but FD 2 is still a solid sequel. It's dark, creative and often genuinely tense. While it may lack a really good finale, there's still plenty of tension throughout. The car pile up is the best car crash scene in cinematic history as far as I'm concerned, and although this sequel makes no secret of the fact it's about the deaths rather than plot, it'll satisfy the gore thirsty fans and provide plenty of ghoulish thrills for many, myself included. They shouldn't have killed off Clear Rivers though.6/10",Final Destination 2
91,shark-43,"Silly Sequel, Impressive Gore",6,20 August 2005,"Again, another surprise hit at the box office so Hollywood tries to squeeze a sequel out of it. Well, given that that isn't a very good idea and that this movie will pretty much be a retread of the first one (which I enjoyed - especially the beginning but ""Death"" became absolutely ridiculous at the end - going through these preposterous ways to try and kill these teenagers)BUT this movie KNOWSthat it is a sequel and that it is silly so yes, the movie and the script are pretty lame BUT what this movie has is some of the most impressive gore and special effects I have seen in a big studio film in a long time. In fact, the opening highway accident is incredibly well shot and set up and the actually violence and trauma of the collisions are breathtaking. Plus once the doddering plot gets going and you are just waiting for the ""survivors"" to bite it, well, the actual deaths are, again, very well done. Now does good gore make a good movie - no. But it certainly makes for a hoot to watch with some of your buddies. Nuff said.",Final Destination 2

No.. not even close. Is it entertaining in it's own right? Yes, to a point. The lead character this time is played by A.J. Cook, a young actress who seems to be popping up in many of these thriller films these days. She plays Kimberly, a girl who has a vision that forshadows a freeway crash that kills herself and many others. She blocks traffic and saves a handfull of people, while others die in the gruesome tragedy. And this movie does not skimp on the violence or gore like many other films these days do. The death scenes in this one are quite gruesome. Of course death starts picking off the survivors in freak accidents and Kimberly goes off to find the only survivivng character from the first film (Ali Larter, looking like she's phoning this one in after cashing what was probably a decent size check for a fairly small part). The film is entertaining on its own face, but does have problems. The conections to the first film are tenuous and seem forced and rather silly and the acting (with the exception of Cook, who does a servicable job) is bad, even by these films standards. The story has enough twists and turns and false scares to provide a decent ride, though understanding all the hookum about death and how to trick him is rather mind boggling, the ending is as silly as can be.  Still, its entertaining enough and has some cool effects and gore scenes so that the less discriminating horror fans should enjoy it. GRADE: C",Final Destination 2

96,FilmFanInTheHouse,"Not as good, but still fun",7,12 March 2008,"Final Destination 2 (2003, Dir. David R. Ellis) Whilst heading onto the main road, Kimberly Corman has a vision of a huge car accident. Halting up the traffic, Kimberly is horrified when the accident actually happens. Kimberly links the occurrence with a similar event a year earlier. Researching up on Clear Rivers, Kimberly discovers that death's pattern has been disturbed, meaning everyone who was originally supposed to die, will now encounter a freak accident. Including her! Kimberly and the rest of the survivors, must work with Clear to try and stop Death from repeating it's process.I personally had a great time watching 'Final Destination', and was hoping for much of the same experience for its first sequel. Although it felt like it to me, later i realised, that it actually isn't as good as the first film. Everyone was great in the film, including Ali Larter, and there was some surprising deaths, but the whole factor of not knowing about death seemed missing. That's what was so great about the first film. No one know how death works, but now they know, it seems to kind of take away the fun.

97,baileycrawly,Cheating Death,5,1 July 2020,"Death is already showing to be unbearably formulaic and we're only two movies into this franchise. It looks, unfortunately, like the established formula is going to be the same for every single film: premonition, prevention, and consequences. Yawn.At the very least, this sequel acknowledges the film that came before it, taking what was started with the endlessly fun and suspenseful Devon Sawa original and trying to continue the story, which most slasher sequels don't bother to do.The kills in this one are just as inventive, fun and - in some cases - shocking as the original one, even if they are beginning to feel a little like more of the same already. This film can still entertain with its kills.It's also interesting the way the filmmakers chose to end these films with shock-induced comedic moments surrounding Death.This film will appeal to anyone who liked the first one; as a stand-alone, it really doesn't offer much. It's a run-of-the-mill slasher with the uniqueness of having a supernatural killer that never actually manifests itself. That's about it.",Final Destination 2
98,funtasticfour,Slightly better than the first!,8,26 November 2019,"I love these movies-an original horror series. The big crash at the beginning is so well done and better than the airplane from the first. Also, kind of lives a nightmare from my childhood car trips.",Final Destination 2
99,nitzanhavoc,"Average film, good sequel, doesn't live up to the first.",6,18 June 2016,"After finally getting to watching the first film, I've just watched this one last night, hoping it's as good as the first. Let's start off by saying it's not. I did have plenty of criticism for certain aspects of the first film (especially to do with the work of director James Wong), but unlike the first film - this one was never going to be as groundbreaking, original and inspiring.Not unlike the first film, the story kicks off with a group of youngsters on their way to to party somehow somewhere. During the drive, Kimberly (the driver) has a vision which makes her pull over, ultimately saving the lives of the people stuck behind her on the highway. When the survivors begin dying, Kimberly seeks out Clear Rivers, one of the survivors of the famous plane explosion from the first film, in hopes that she could help her and her new friends ""break the pattern"" and ""beat death's design"". The only original addition is new information shared by the creepy mortician (always great to see Candyman Tony Todd, eerie and unnerving as ever).Besides the obvious lack of originality or even the slightest attempt to offer something new plot and story-wise, Final Destination 2 suffers from two obvious shortcomings (in my opinion of course): First, any attempt to compensate for a lacking story with over-intensified gore scenes is low class in my book; and second, the deaths seem too supernatural, much more than in the first film. Where in the first film some water leak, causing the victim to slip - this time the amount of ""coincidents"" leading to each ""freak accident"" feel too much like divine (or unholy) intervention, too deliberate and too far fetched. Not as convincing, not as reasonable, not as good.The small attempt at a plot twist towards the ending isn't successful, and the ending itself is far too comical (again, not unlike the first film). All in all, as a standalone film the film is average at best, and as a sequel - not more than good. It's still a lot of fun to watch after the first, and it definitely isn't a bad film or a reason to quit on the anthology, it just very obviously could have been better.",Final Destination 2
100,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,7,21 March 2005,"Of all the Scream clones, or more appropriately, teen horror movies to come from the nineties and beyond, Final Destination has always been the best. It seemed likely then that it would get a sequel, and deservedly so as the first was so effective, and we want to see what has become of the survivors. As with the majority of horror sequels, the gore is increased, the deaths are more elaborate, and the plot introduces something new. And of course it is not as good. However, the makers of Final Destination 2 clearly recognise this, and rather than trying to make a superior film, they try to out-do the first in shock value and death scenes, and at times succeed, as well as making the story involving and entertaining too. Much of the tension, thematic depth, and style of the first film is lost, but it more than makes up for this with buckets of blood which will satisfy all us gore hounds.Kimberley and her friends are leaving for Spring Break. On the highway she has a premonition of a massive pile-up and her own death, as well as the deaths of several others. She stops her car, thereby preventing her involvement with the crash, and all the cars behind her whose passengers would have been killed. A cop intervenes and she tries to explain. The pile-up occurs anyway, and her friends are killed too. Soon it becomes apparent that they have cheated death, who is now coming to pick them off one by one. Some believe this, some don't, and Kimberley decides to find Clear rivers, the sole survivor of last year's similar phenomenon. Together they try to stop death from getting them, but it seems that death will not be fooled so easily this time.Like the first film, an unusual amount of other story lines could have been conceived if a certain character had done a certain thing differently. Questions of fate though are largely avoided in favour of elaborate deaths and effects, though this is still an intelligent film. As all the survivors of the car crash are connected to those who died in the aftermath of the plane crash, it may be thought that death is doing this simply to pull Clear into the open. The ripple effect may be said to be ever expanding, that soon everyone will die, and of course this is true, but while death may be stalking us all, new life ensures that we will continue to exist. The deaths here are mostly more impressive, less subtle, as some of the original deaths were slow and seemingly could have been easily avoided. Here, heads are smashed off, people are burnt and cut apart and various implements are used to deadly, and funny effect. The film moves quickly, with less emphasis on characterisation than the first had, but there are still many laughs, shocks and excitement. While the first may have made you genuinely fear death, this is mainly about fun and gore, with the odd are of discussion such as...what if? 7.5 out of 10",Final Destination 2
101,TheEmulator23,good laugh horror,7,26 July 2003,"This is probably one of the few horror movies that i laughed at, but was grossed out at, at the same time.  I enjoyed the 1st one immensely, but this one just was better in my eyes.  I knew what was going to happen to them, i just didn't know how!  Just knowing that alone made this for a very entertaining film.  It also had the best highway crash sequence i have ever seen.  I sure hope they make a 3rd.  Maybe have AJ cooks character be like Ali larters.",Final Destination 2
102,christian123,Very entertaining and better than the original,5,17 May 2005,"Final Destination 2 is a very entertaining sequel and while the story is weaker then the first, the deaths are better. Kimberly (A.J. Cook) is a normal teen who is taking a road trip to Daytona with her 3 friends. She has a vision of a horrific traffic accident and so she blocks some of the cars from entering the highway. Sure enough they vision comes true and they have all just escaped death. Kim visits Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), the only survivor of Flight 180 who is convinced to help out the survivors of Route 23. Alex, who died between films, had been hit in the head with a falling brick. Kim, Clear and other strangers that are left must try to stick together and cheat Death again. The plot may sound stupid but its actually not all that bad. The story may not make sense at some scenes and the story is filled with holes. Its hard though to write a good story for something like this and I think they gave a good effort. The first film was very good and a lot of fun to watch. The sequel is even more fun to watch, even if it does get silly at times. Its better to watch the original before watching this so it would be easier to follow the story. Most horror films today are to silly to take serious and that's why you shouldn't really approach this one expecting an Oscar quality film. The acting was decent with the best being Ali Larter. She and Tony Todd are the only stars returning from the original film. A.J. Cook plays Kimberly and she does an okay job. The rest of the cast are mostly unknowns and aren't worth mentioning. David R. Ellis directs and he does really good job. He also directed the fast paced and exciting Cellular. The film is very gory and also very fun. Final Destination 2 was very creative when it came to killing off the characters. A couple of the death scenes do go over the top though the film delivers the goods for the most part. The film is only 90 minutes long so it's a quick film to watch. The movie also never gets boring as its always entertaining. I wouldn't say the film is to scary but there are some moments that may leave with fear. In the end, this is a very good sequel, that's better then the original and worth checking out. I just hope Final Destination 3 is just as good or even better then this film. Rating 7.8/10, check this film out as its very entertaining.",Final Destination 2
103,kdnor2011,Not very good,4,13 May 2010,"I...don't really like this movie very much. There is some stuff I like, but there is just too much stuff that doesn't add up for me. I just don't get why people consider this the best in the franchise, or at least the only good sequel. I can understand liking it, but I just can't see how you can like this and not like at least 3 and 5.First, some of the deaths scenes don't make sense. Why did Tommy do something as stupid as to run out into a construction site to chase pigeons. How is it that the elevator moves despite the the doors being opened. Also, there are a lot of things that don't add up. Why is it that death is going backwards. Kimberly and her friends died last in the vision and died first in real life (except for Kimberly who was saved.) Did I miss it, I've seen this film like three times and I still don't understand how that works. And while the idea of the first movie character's deaths saving these new characters from dying and thus death wants to kill them again, it basically means that death is an idiot. He messed up his own plan. The sucide doesn't make a damn bit of sense. And the ending sucked. Unless Bryan had that bone disease Samuel L. Jackson had in Unbreakable, I don't see how he would have died from that newsfan hitting him.But I don't hate this film, there are some deaths scenes that I really enjoyed such as the barb wire fence and the explosion in the hospital and even the fire escape was fun. The opening disaster was fantastic, I love the stuntwork and the effects. There are some funny moments. And it at least seemed like they were trying really hard to make this a good sequel.I don't hate this movie, but there are too many things wrong with it for me. If you like it that's cool, but I can't see how it can be considered the best in the franchise.",Final Destination 2

105,nobbytatoes,holds itself beside the original,7,24 April 2006,"Kimberly and her friends are taking a road trip to Datona. The news reports that it is one year later from the airplane incident where Alex had a vision of a plane exploding. While waiting on an on-ramp to the freeway, Kimberly has a premonition of a massive highway crash. After she stops people for dying in the pile up, the 'survivors' have cheated death. Kimberly believes that the recurrence of this cheat to death, means that death is now coming to take them.Final Destination 2 doesn't really deviate from the first movie. A group of people cheat death, then death comes after them one by one. Though screenwriters Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber have changed things around, changing death tactics and order in which people go, so this doesn't end up as a cut and copy; like so many sequels do.Like Final Destination, Final Destination 2 isn't that great of a film. The acting again isn't great, nor is the dialog of the script. Taking over from James Wong, David R. Ellis direction is just a notch better; making the film look more slick and glossy; though Wong's grittier look help the suspense more. What made the first film so interesting were the elaborative death scenes. Ellis has increased the violence, and the death sequences are even more meticulously played out. The opening sequence of the car crashes is one of the most mind blowing, well crafted, orchestrated pile up crash I have seen in a movie.Just like Final Destination, Final Destination 2 is a guilty pleasure of a watch.",Final Destination 2
106,squeezebox,More creative carnage is the only improvement,2,8 July 2005,"Read my review of the first FINAL DESTINATION, because this is the same movie. Same terrible dialog, same vacuous performances, same convoluted and illogical screenplay. Both movies take a potentially interesting concept and do nothing with it, basically striving to be little more than rip-offs of THE OMEN.The only thing that could possibly be thought of as an improvement over the first one is the passably creative death sequences. One gets the feeling that they were the first things written, and the flimsiest excuse for a story was molded around them to pad the movie out to ninety minutes.And I would be far more shocked to see a movie that DIDN'T have a twist ending, not that the ""twist"" was anything I didn't see coming a mile away.I suppose, if you're extremely stupid, you might find some entertainment value in this crap. However, if you graduated from elementary school, try something more challenging, like POLICE ACADEMY.",Final Destination 2

The problem is that it was not directed by James Wong, and Ellis, while doing a good job, did not have the vision that Wong did for the first film. That having been said, this film is still a very watchable sequel and bringing back Ali Larter as Clear Rivers, the one survivor of the first film was a definite plus.It is now a year after the crash of flight 180 and death is out hunting again, as the plot unfolds we find that nearly everyone on his list had some tie to one of the dead people in the first film. Some of the deaths are even gorier than the previous picture but delivered in much different ways. It is this that keeps the franchise fresh. I give it 8 out of ten.",Final Destination 2

109,Quicksand,"Not Unlike Porn: No Logic, No Story, Just Money Shots",4,11 February 2006,"This is not a good movie.I went through other comments, and all that, and most of the ""pro"" comments seem to call it watchable, scary, gory, suspenseful... and the opening traffic accident is all of these things, but it fades away the instant this scene ends and the movie has to rely on its actors. It's not that they're bad, they're just under-directed, and stuck with a screenplay that has moments like, say, a character picks his jacket up, knocks a pool-ball to the floor, which rolls to a mousetrap, which snaps and flings the ball up into he air, knocking loose a suspended kayak, which swings loose and nearly kills someone. ""Should have seen that coming,"" says the movie's most experienced character... Is that supposed to be a funny line? Seen that coming HOW, exactly? By watching out for pool balls? Not unlike Friday the 13th Part... I dunno, say, VII: The New Blood, this is NOT a good movie.I'm defining ""good movie"" as something with character, a plot, and a conflict which must be resolved. The first one had these things. But ""FD2"" is structured like a porno-- the writers clearly got together beforehand and came up with each 'action' sequence, then cobbled together some terrible talking-scenes to hold them together. What saved this movie from being straight-to-video, I'd wager, is that the action scenes come off pretty well. Only half of them are clever or original, all are well staged and photographed, but what comes between them pales in comparison to ""Mimic 2"" or ""Leprechaun 4: In Space."" Director David Ellis, who is about as competent as the director of ""The Fly II,"" must be the best liar in the world. ""In this scene,"" he must have told an actor, ""There's smoldering remains next to you, but don't show grief or horror, we'll work that out in editing."" At least in the first one Devon Sawa was a good enough actor to pass off his lack of grief as growing madness. Here the actors just say the lines and move from scene-to-scene making no sense or logic, just chess pieces (well, checkers pieces) awaiting the next gore scene. And by the way-- the first film? The emphasis was on suspense, not blood.The first film was something interesting and clever (and cool) from writers of ""The X-Files."" Here, the writing is embarrassingly incompetent, there's as much tension as a trip to the mailbox, and the director blew 80% of his budget on two scenes, and suddenly he's A-List for ten minutes. It won't last; the final twenty seconds of the film were the only cheer-worthy moments. Something else it has in common with ""The Fly II"" ... which shows you the kind of raw talent we're working with here. Car crash-- 9/10. Rest of film-- 1/10. Subtract a point for completely wasting Tony Todd, leaves us with 4/10.",Final Destination 2

116,happyendingrocks,"""As Good"" isn't bad",8,16 June 2009,"In many ways this Final Destination installment one-ups its stylish and original predecessor. However, while the best elements are improved to dramatic effect, the returning presence of the wretchedly-named Clear Rivers brings some un-needed hokum to an otherwise feverish and thrilling dance with death.The original Final Destination used benign everyday terrors to make every bit of supernatural indulgence seem utterly believable, and it is in this respect that the second chapter exceeds the original. While the plane crash in the first FD tapped into the fears of all rational people who understand that multi-ton pieces of metal shouldn't sensibly be able to fly, by setting this film in the aftermath of a disaster borne from the routine car rides we tempt death with every single day, this sequel bases its horror in roots that apply universally. After all, most of us CHOOSE to get on an airplane, but very few of us have any say in the roles that automobiles play in our everyday lives. We don't have any choice but to commute to our jobs or schools, and if a car is needed for these important functions, we have to simply accept the fact that there is a possibility that we will not make our destination due to circumstances on the road beyond our control. This is a balance we tempt every time we drive, and cars crash far more often than planes do, so the scenario in this film trumps the original sort of by default.The horrific pileup that sparks this chapter's conflict with Death is by far the most harrowing and genuinely scary car accident ever seen in a film. As in the original, the details preface the carnage with sadistic glee, and the intricacies within the crash itself are as believable as they are devastating.By topping the dramatic and terrifying catalyst in the first film, this sequel starts off on a promising note, and its a promise that is almost maintained throughout. After the set-up, which basically mimics the first FD, the film-makers are savvy enough to know that since there is a formula in place, the shock of the kills is going to be diluted by the sense of the familiar. Of course, the only way to counterbalance this is to make the kills themselves as spectacular and superior as the crash. This, they offer whole-heartedly.While employing the same Rube Goldberg chains found in the original film, the death scenes in Final Destination 2 floor anything we've previously seen in the franchise. Both the tension and gore are amped up to grisly and boisterous effect, and the elevator and fire-escape set-pieces not only rival anything in the franchise, they are on par with the best in the horror genre. Again, by using things we see every day as tools of death, the realism the series is rooted in is kept very much intact.It would be a shame to give away any particulars for anyone who hasn't seen the film, so I'll keep the grisly details in my head and off the page. But, it's a safe bet that anyone seeing this film for the first time will have fresh insight about the banality of barbed wire and car safety features when the film is finished.If the film was just a series of gory and over-the-top executions, it could have easily surpassed the original in terms of sheer thrill factor. However, when the film delves too deeply into the unnecessary mythology, things get a bit silly, and the sharp tension generated through the underlying premise is diluted by the screenwriters trying to make sense out of the senseless. Don't they realize that it's scary enough that Death is stalking these ""lucky"" survivors one by one? That idea is sufficient to carry this film, but for some reason, the film-makers saw fit to muddy up this effective premise with endless postulating about why Death is chasing our cast. Death is going in reverse, and ""tying up all the loose ends""? Really? Is Death really that organized? Are we all just Power Point pie charts on Death's laptop? Somehow, it seems a bit scarier if Death is just as senseless as the brutal and heinous bits of life-ending generated in the initial car accident.And why, oh, why did they bring back Clear Rivers? In addition to inducing eye-rolling every time someone says that ridiculous name, Ali Larter's character in this film is an annoying and gibbering caricature with all the credibility of a bag-lady carrying a ""The End Is Near"" sign. In the first film, she was an understated and well-played normal person dealing with extraordinary events. Somehow these events have transformed her into a raving prophet of doom who knows all of death's secrets and passes on her sage-like madness to this new batch of future victims. The dialogue fed to her is atrocious, as is her broken-soul delivery. And being introduced to her in a mental institution where she is lent so much authority you'd think she built the joint certainly doesn't help matters. (Really? Mental patients have closed-circuit television monitors in their padded rooms that allow them a view of the hallway outside their cell?). Larter's screen time is mercifully short, but in the second act, when she's allowed to run free with her ramblings, the movie slows to a mediocre crawl.If the film were able to sustain the adrenalized surge it captures from the opening pileup on, Final Destination 2 would have easily outpaced the original. The deaths are certainly magnificently rendered and shocking, and the ""gotcha"" ending is a grimly hilarious, if predicable, curtain call. But, given the areas where it exceeds the first FD, I suppose it's a great accomplishment for a sequel to even be as good as the film that spawned it. At least in that sense, Final Destination 2 has to be viewed as a success.",Final Destination 2

Considering there's so much to explore with the concept set up in the first installment, there was bound to be a sequel. But luckily, this movie is awesome!A character once again has a premonition of a horrible accident, this time a disastrous car crash. A couple of people thankfully are saved... but for how long? There are slightly more survivors in this movie, partly because Clear from the first movie returns (this is only a spoiler if you haven't even seen THAT one). In terms of characters, they were really good. Kimberly and Thomas were very likable, Eugene is hilarious and of course it's also a plus that Clear is back. Speaking of her, she's different in this movie. She's more cold, sassy and doesn't manage to get along all that well. But considering what she has gone through, I think it's commendable character development. She has a lot of scars from previous events and so is not the same person she was before. Even so, I was completely rooting for her. Here, she plays the role of guiding the new survivors in order to help them escape Death. She and... Mr. Bludworth. It would have been stupid not to have him return, so I'm happy he makes another appearance here. He knows even MORE about Death this time, and the scene with him is perfectly uncomfortable. You won't BELIEVE what he's doing while talking to the teenagers!David R. Ellis directed this movie, and with the over-the-top action in this movie, it's easy to see this is the guy who made Snakes On A Plane. He's clearly having fun, but also seems to know where the limit goes here. Sure the action is crazy, but it's FUNNY-crazy! The humor is even darker than the first movie, and I was laughing hard so many times I lost count. That's not a negative thing however, this movie knew what it was doing and so managed to highly entertain me. And there is still great tension, as it often is unpredictable where the movie will go.New twists and turns, many quotable lines, a great cast and is just enough chilling to be interesting. Don't worry, this is a sequel worth batting an eye at.",Final Destination 2
119,ScottDMenzel,Not as good as the first but worth watching.,6,31 January 2003,"I am a huge fan of the first Final Destination film. I would give it a rating of a 9/10. Needless to say I was looking forward to the sequel. So after talking about it for months with my friends, today was opening day and I went to see it. When it started out, I was like oh man this is going to suck because we had drug jokes, a flashing biker chick, and lots of bad acting by everyone in the movie except the main character Kimberly. Then two minutes later the movie got exciting with the best scene in the movie and from that scene on I was hooked. I watched it and enjoyed it. I was very entertained but the only thing that really bothered me was the acting. Ali Larter was still good as Clear Rivers, A. J.  Cook did a decent job in the role as Kimberly and Michael Landes as Officer Thomas Burke did a very good job, but everyone else should go back to acting class because their acting was incredibly poor. Now what I did like about the movie was the deaths. They were just as good as the deaths in the first film. The deaths were a bit bloodier this time around and for some reason caused some laughs which really confused me. I think the bloodier deaths were supposed to make up for the bad acting =). The Deaths were cool, the plot was interesting, the acting from the 3 main characters was decent, but the acting from everyone else was horrible. So if you liked final destination 1 then see the sequel, it won't disappoint on following the same plot and pace as the first one,  as long as you can get over the bad acting from the supporting cast you will enjoy yourself. My rating for Final Destination 2 would be a 7/10.",Final Destination 2

At least they use a different setting like one year after the flight 180 crash and they use cars instead of using the same thing over and over again.

126,LanceBrave,Sick Kills and Gruesome Humor,7,7 November 2013,"I never would have thought that ""Final Destination"" would have become one of the most enduring millennial horror franchises. The original wasn't a bad movie. It was a fairly clever update of the slasher formula which owed more then a little to ""The Omen."" (Both series dispatch their victims through convoluted Rube Goldberg-style accidental death traps.) However, it was horribly earnest and, beyond the wacky death scenes, it had little else to offer. I think the only reason the ""Final Destination"" series has had the longevity it has is because, unlike the ""Saws"" and ""Paranormal Activities,"" the series hasn't burnt itself out with yearly installment. The movies are elaborate enough to force a few years between each installment. The reason I say this is because none of the movies are all that good. Except for this one. (And part five but I'm not talking about that one right now.) And it's good the same way a ""Friday the 13th"" sequel is good. From a writing perspective, these movies are Dumb. The entire premise is kind of dumb. Lots of people survive near death experiences every year and most of them aren't brutally killed afterwards in ridiculous, contrived manners. There's a reason that, despite five films being made, none of these movies have ever attempt to build up any kind of mythology, aside from throwing out more ways to escape ""Death's design"" that most certainly do not work. It's never been said but can certainly be assumed that the psychic visions that open each film are provided by Death. So why does Death give people these vision just with the intention of then brutally murdering them afterwards? Why does Death brutally murder people anyway? It's Death! He can off you in any way! Why make such a show of it? The only real thing we can gleam from all of this is that the Grim Reaper has an utterly brutal sense of irony and is also a passive aggressive jerk hole. Tony Todd's character shows up every couple of movies to sinisterly hiss some bit of vague misinformation, as if he really knows what's going on.So the story is utter nonsense. Like a ""Friday the 13th"" film, each entry in the series has the same blueprint. Character has vision of horrific accident that gorily kills loads of people, some how manages to avoid said accident, himself and his friend proceed to suffer horrible accidental deaths Or deaths that seem accidental anyway. Part two is no different. The characters aren't great. They roughly break down into stereotypes: Final girl, an initially skeptical love interest, stoner guy, snarky chick, Mom, Son, Angry Black Man. Some of the characters get a smidge of personality. Angry Black Man panics nicely. My favorite moment is when Stoner Guy knows he's the next in line to die. He tells Final Girl to, after he dies, go into his apartment and remove all his drugs and porn, anything that will ""break his mom's heart."" It is a surprisingly touching moment in a movie that otherwise dispenses with any character moments. None of the actors are bad, with one exception: Ali Larter, the returning survivor from the first movie. Holy spit, how did this lady become a star? She's wooden, wears one slightly constipated expression throughout, and can never make a single line sound convincing. The ""Resident Evil"" movies clearly deserve her.None of that matters anyway because the entire movie is built around the death scenes. And, holy cow, they are incredible. The opening freeway pile-up is hugely intense. The motorcyclist sliding across the glass is uncomfortably realistic to anyone who has survived a bike crash. The entire sequence will make you nervous every time you pass a truck hauling logs. It's a heck of way to open the movie. The kitchen sequence is the first sign of the movie's darkly humorous wit. It's an over-the-top, extended game of misdirection that has an amazingly nasty, unpleasant payoff. Characters explode into ludicrous giblets with little provocation. A battering log smears a man to splattering meat and blood. In the best kill in the movie, a teenage kid is squashed by a falling plate of glass, dissipating into an explosion of blood and gore. Person one second, puddle the next. Even for a seasoned gore fan like myself, it's almost too much. The dark humor shows up again when the Jaws of Life have the opposite effect. My second favorite kills involves a flying barb-wire fence dissecting a guy into four parts. The stunted look on the guy's face is almost hilarious, even if the globs of intestine are nasty. The movie never quite tops those moments even if the hospital set last act rolls along at a decent pace. The gore comedy mentality continues into the final scene.And that's why ""Final Destination 2"" is awesome. The death scenes are some of the wettest ever put to film and any mean spirit intentions are grinned away by the movie's dark wit. That's one of the reasons why three and four disappointed me so much. They returned to the dead serious tone of the first entry. Only five featured the same sick kills and gruesome humor. Hopefully the inevitable part six will continue that tradition.",Final Destination 2
127,blacklist-1,Very enjoyable but not a patch on the original.,7,11 April 2010,"FD 2 gets new director David Ellis and the story is literally the same as the first one where a teenage girl called Kimberly is on a road-trip to Daytona with 3 friends but on the highway she has a premonition of a massive pile up. Cue comes she freaks out and everyone who cheats death is put on a new list.Ali Larter's character Clear Rivers is revived from the first one and is first found at the Stony Brook institution as the only survivor as Alex from the first dies between films (a brick dislodged itself from a building and hit him in the head) Kimberley asks for Clears help as she is still on death's list.The story is nothing new though there is a connection with the people on the new list to the first one, which I liked. The deaths are still inventive and gruesome and the acting is still to a good standard. Ali Larter is the best actress of the film whilst Tony Todd the mortician from the first one reprises his role in one scene which he makes the most of and Kimberly played by A.J Cook isn't bad either.This isn't a patch on the original as it's not really scary but you do feel for the characters still to some extent particularly Clear. The music is also good.It's a very enjoyable hour and a half and is a very good sequel to it's predecessor. I recommend a watch if you liked the first one or are a horror fan.",Final Destination 2

129,jrfranklin01,Biggest Shock - The Lame Ending,4,1 July 2004,"As a director I would think you would have things made after the success of the original Final Destination directed by James Wong and written by Jeffrey Reddick.  You have a great story given to you and a good solid format to follow - horror, suspense, horror, suspense.And the director of the sequel seemed to understand this, as David Ellis follows the footsteps of Wong.  He does a great job of shocking you and leaving you guessing as to who is going to die next and how.  However, what is most disappointing and horribly tragic about the sequel is that it does not deliver in its conclusion.  The first ended with the same suspense that drove the entire film.  In the second, it seems Reddick through together a cheap new twist and then had Director Ellis give a hack job of an ending, complete with all the cheesiness in the world.  You watch 3/4's of a great film to be left with putty of an ending.  I saw that Final Destination 3 is in production for 2006 with James Wong back at the helm.  I feel sorry for the guy because now he has the challenge of luring viewers back to the series after Ellis screwed it up.",Final Destination 2
130,iguth,Good sequel to the original,6,19 May 2019,This movie is a good follow up to the original. It introduces new mechanics in regards to death. The movie has a beginning that feels like a horror but again is not a horror film. The use of a character from the previous movie creates interesting scenarios but seems like it may have been the creators taking an idea from Saw II. Still not as much gore as I'd think but a little more than the original. The characters are more cooperative but their backstories are not as interconnected to one another (except they kind of are).,Final Destination 2
131,Barky44,Shouldn't have bothered -- the first one was so good by itself,4,5 June 2005,"Ah yes, the curse of all decent teen slasher flicks: the unimaginative sequel.For the most part sequels are the bane of film. For every ""Empire Strikes Back"" you get ten ""Final Destination 2s"".Sequels work like this: producer A has run out of ideas. So instead of trying to get imaginative people to bring good ideas to the studio (an expensive process), they simply rehash something that had success in the past (a cheaper process). They find one of the stars from the first one, usually one of the weaker talents (all the good people went off to do real projects). They get a hack writer to throw together a screenplay almost wholly contrived from the first one (I hope it at least pays their bills). Then they film it in the fastest time possible, super-size it with a made-for-MTV soundtrack, and send it out. Raking in the cash from teenagers with disposable income is the easy part.I just realized that I've been typing for a while and haven't really talked about the movie. It sucks.

132,bob_bear,Surprisingly Good,8,19 February 2006,"I came to this film with no expectations - I hadn't seen the original installment. The way the opening builds to a creshendo of horror is spectacular. From then on, - and, once I'd gotten over the shock of the gruesome death of the first ""survivor"", I found myself both thoroughly entertained and impressed. Intelligent horror? Yes, it is possible!Unlike, other reviewers, I thought the acting was excellent by and large. The only truly irritating moments in the movie were provided by the black character who repeatedly refused to believe something spooky was going on in the face of increasingly overwhelming evidence - it's a stock device and it's so lame. But this had nothing to do with the guy's acting ability, which I thought was excellent given the limitations of his given character.Otherwise, I was just totally impressed by the artistry of the team behind this shocker. The build-up of tension, the tease, that led towards each death was masterful.I read the list of ""goofs"" the film is supposed to feature and, with only one exception, I didn't spot any. I was just so drawn in to the action.I'm not big on horror as a genre but, if you're going to watch an odd horror or two, I can certainly recommend this.",Final Destination 2
133,QueenMakeda84,Things that makes you go: What the F***?,1,27 December 2004,"Throughout the entire movie, I kept thinking: Death comes in all forms. Why must it kill so violently and abnormally? Come on, a sheet of glass crushing someone to death? Electrical wires from a fence slicing you into pieces? The shower cord strangling you to death? You're alcoholic beverage leaving condensation and setting your place on fire and allowing for a butcher knife to kill you? Come on! They could've gotten cancer, heart attacks, sickle-cell anemia. I mean there are plenty of ways to die. Death is not this psycho that has to kill you violently in order to maintain its ""grand"" design. Now, someone might say, QueenMakeda84, there's no point to the movie if they all died like that. Exactly my point! There shouldn't have even been a movie because the way Death is presented is super-de-duper whack.And what was with the eerie black mortician? Who really gets into it like that? I like Tony Todd too, but this is not the way to go after being on Hercules and Xena. I mean, the guy was like a Shakespearean actor in a kindergarten play. Take it down a notch. And furthermore, his character was severely unnecessary. They could've googled for all that information. He seemed more like someone from Conan than of the 20th century along with the rest of the cast. And A.J. Cook, I loved you in ""Higher Ground"", but you're slipping with this movie. Don't get me wrong, you played the insecure girl with freaky death premonitions well, but you're better than this. I guess times are hard. Ali didn't even seem to wanna be there and I don't blame her. I think she was just waiting to be blown to pieces at the end of the movie and was hurrying it along as much as possible to get out of this disaster of an idea.The movie honestly tried, but it couldn't bite the cheese. Maybe it was supposed to be stupid, but for my money, I better get a moral to the story or some laughs along the way. I got neither.

Cook.Following a fantastic opening sequence (the infamous high-way pile-up), the film moves at a steady pace, though resulting in a rather disappointing finale. While the film is not necessarily that scary, the deaths are very interesting, and most of the time take place just when you think everything is safe. Worthy of particular note is the death of Lynda Boyd's character who meets an untimely demise involving an elevator.The cast are all competent, with Larter, Cook and hottie Michael Landes as Thomas the police officer carrying the film. Keegan Connor Tracy is always good, and Lynda Boyd is very sympathetic. The actor who plays her son Tim, James Kirk, is pretty good too, the others who are all destined to die are rather annoying. Justina Machido (from ""Six Feet Under"") is fabulous, once again playing a pregnant woman, who the group must somehow find.So while the film isn't groundbreaking, it is an entertaining watch with a mostly likable cast, good pace and some inventive death scenes. The reason I believe it is better watched on DVD is for the fun facts the pop up across the screen during the course of the film, loaded with trivia and behind the scenes info.",Final Destination 2

The plot has scarcely developed and the parts that have are too small to notice without watching it multiple times. Nevertheless, it is quite a fun splatter movie.It's exactly one year after the Flight 180 disaster, and when a teenage girl on the road has a premonition in which she, her friends and all the other drivers die in a huge pile-up, she blocks the road and saves a handful of people. But when the pile-up does occur, the survivors begin to be picked off, one by one Perhaps six out of ten is somewhat too generous, as this film lives purely on the first film's lustre.

143,lostintwinpeaks,REMAKE OR SEQUEL?,4,1 March 2003,"WHAT FOLLOWS IS THE REVIEW I WROTE FOR THE FIRST MOVIE:""The strength of FINAL DESTINATION lies in its ability to keep audiences on (to use a cliche) the edge of their seats. Or rather, to convince audiences that something is about to happen, then do a complete turn-around and have something else inexplicably happen.WHAT AM I TALKING ABOUT?Well, for example the death scenes. A large build-up ensues, where the movie convinces the audience that a character is going to die in all sorts of horrible ways. Then an anticlimatical drop occurs. The audience sighs, the character will be ok they think. But then - WHAM! - the character is killed in a most unexpected way. This is the power of this movie. Otherwise, the acting isn't very good; the script unsurprising; and the direction often slack, surprisingly so for John Woo.As for the core of the movie, the characters are hastily sketched with no depth and the storyline is rather old-hat fare. There is no denying it, this is a very silly film - but it will have you hooked till the end.Also of note: FINAL DESTINATION is a slasher movie, and the first without an actual killer - death itself stalks the protaganists instead. Interesting too is the way the movie turns everyday objects and occurences into lethal weapons, and sometimes in rather original ways. There are also some neat in-jokes throughout.Bottom-line: Silly but with style and an ability to grip even the most reluctant viewer.""
THE ABOVE REVIEW IS PRETTY MUCH IDENTICAL FOR THIS - FINAL DESTINATION 2. WHY? BECAUSE THE MOVIES ARE ALMOST COMPLETELY IDENTICAL. THIS IS A FUN MOVIE WITH SOME GREAT SCARES AND GORY MOMENTS. BUT IT IS BASICALLY A REHASH OF THE ORIGINAL. NOT A SEQUEL SO MUCH AS A REMAKE.",Final Destination 2

The result, aided by an ingenious script, was a highly entertaining film - sometimes funny, sometimes scary, sometimes just good. But it was a concept that could only really stand one examination.The second film is a step too far. Once again, we see an interesting cast playing characters who are slaughtered in various imaginative ways. But at least two of the death scenarios really labor the point to the extent that, by an hour into the film, I was laughing too hard to have any energy left to suspend disbelief.Not wholly unentertaining for all that, but only see this if you've nothing else to watch.

In the beginning scenes on the road, the film stooped down to the typical teen flick, with the unneeded, but really good nudity, and the teenager that sneaks in a bag of pot. That was one of the very few flaws that Final Destination 2 had. Like I said earlier, Final Destination 2 has tons of blood, guts, and mayhem, and that's what I liked about the movie. The beginning scene with all the car crashes seriously out-did the first films beginning scene with the plain exploding. Some parts of the beginning are a bit illogical, i.e. all the cars exploding fast like that. Another thing that has bogged down, is the acting. Ali Larter is a terrific actress, and she gave a good performance, but I was seriously disappointed with A.J. Cook's performance. Her last film before Final Destination 2 was Wishmaster 3, which was the absolute worst film of all time. Final Destination 2 surpasses the first film's death scenes. The deaths is Final Destination 2 were so creative, and so inventive, it was unbelievable. Final Destination 2 also has A LOT more blood, and gore than the first film, which I seriously liked. The story is basically the same thing, just with a few more differences. I didn't like the fact that there was a way to stop death from killing everyone, that was cliché, because every movie always has a way to stop everything. The first film was also more original, and the pacing was just right. Final Destination 2's pacing was a little off, because it was always one death after another, but I didn't really care. Overall, Final Destination 2 is better than the first film, because there is more mayhem, blood, and guts, and they did not waste time in the film with needless scenes. However, Final Destination 1 also had some elements that were better than the second film's. The acting was SO much better in the first film, and the story was more original, but the deaths were not as creative.

And the plane crash in the beginning was incredibly well made and horrifying! Here the plot is more or less the same. A girl has a vision of a huge serial car crash on the highway and of course she is a survivor among a few others. And soon enough they start dying, one by one, in some VERY implausible ways. All the death scenes are very well made, nicely built up and most of them pretty shocking. But this movie has so little else to offer. Performances are adequate at best (the heroine is pretty sympathetic though), the plot is almost non-existent and, worst, the film is pretty tedious when there are no deaths. We get a lot of mumbo-jumbo about ""death's design"" and ""list of death"", but those of us who saw the first FD will yawn and think about something else.

150,Scoopy,Weak Sequel,3,27 January 2003,"Back in 2000, Final Destination was kind of a surprise mini-hit at the U.S. box office, with a $53 million domestic gate. Critics didn't generally care for it, but I sort of enjoyed the youth-targeted entry in the horror/slasher genre. It had a modicum of ingenuity, maintained an ominous tone, and managed to pull off some creative deaths which seemed to come jarringly out of nowhere. Oh, sure, it used the same old formula, but at least it handled everything pretty well.In that first film, a teenager pulled his friends off a plane based on a premonition that they would all die. The plane did blow up, but ol' Mr Death was mighty ticked off at being cheated, so he eventually caught up with them and killed them in the same order in which they would have died if they ha d stayed in their seats.Death has always been a sore loser! He makes John McEnroe look as gracious and white-bread noble as Lou Gehrig. Hell, he's still hacked off about losing that chess game in The Seventh Seal.This year's sequel takes place on the anniversary of that first plane crash. In the latest development, a young girl has a premonition of a massive pile-up on the interstate highway, so she uses her car to prevent her friends and some others from using the on-ramp. The pile-up does occur, so she saves many lives, but Mr Death is still being a poor sport in the sequel, and he starts immediately to kill off the people who were spared unduly.Um ... assuming that makes sense to you so far, it pretty much stops making sense there. The girl with the premonition goes to a mental institution to visit the one girl who survived the airplane incident in the original movie. (Ali Larter, who appears in both films and has enough talent that she should have a better career than this.) Together, the girls go to visit that Candyman dude with the really low voice, who is apparently in this movie because his own horror series has run out of sequels. He's supposed to be an expert in death, and he mutters some profoundly spooky stuff which makes little sense but sounds important, so the survivors mull it over for the rest of the film. He tells them that ""only a new life can defeat death"".
Before the survivors can figure out the precise meaning of Candyman's advice, they come up with several misinterpretations of the cryptic remarks, and most of them end up dying in nasty ways - their bowels chopped out and their nostrils raped and ... well, for the details, consult the Sir Robin song in Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Will any survive? You have to watch it to see.The sequel does not have the talented Devon Sawa. It has none of the jarring surprise engendered by the Rube Goldberg deaths that marked the first film. It also has very little of the macabre wit that powered the original, the only real exception occurring in the very last ten seconds of the film. Mostly it just has scenes which depict the explicit dismemberment, piercing, decapitation, and fricasseeing of various humans, and the distribution of their remains in unpleasant places.Although the original Final Destination was a popular film with young audiences at home and abroad, most critics hated it. I rather enjoyed that first one in a guilty pleasure sense, but I didn't consider the sequel worth watching at all.",Final Destination 2
151,whoTheFuqRyou,my god....,8,1 February 2003,"*minor spoilers here in case  haven't seen this* this movie was extremely merciless as far as quality of death scenes and the premonition of the freeway pile-up was absolutely AWFUL(but in a good way)!!!  Even if u were able to predict who was gonna die, it aways managed to throw you off in terms of the way they got killed.  It was also very interesting how all of these characters were somehow linked to the bunch from the 1st Final Destination, whether it had somethin' to do w/ riding the bus that hit Terry Chaney or replacing Ms. Lewton @ Mt. Abraham HS, etc. etc. I will give u a hint that the past does catch up w/ a particular somebody in this movie too, but like I said there were some extremely gruesome death scenes like the elevator scene, the barbed wire slicing someone up and not to mention two people getting impaled pretty violently. Death pulls off an intense rebound in the beginning after the pile-up but I will leave it at a subliminal that!   This movie was WAAAY better than the first like said earlier, I was VERY impressed w/ this movie, it was off the hook - best horror movie since The Forsaken IMO... 9/10",Final Destination 2
152,LinkGoku,a fun gore movie,8,23 August 2010,"After watching the first film i decided to give this movie a try.Just like the first one this movie wasn't scary, though unlike the first one this movie is actually a really fun gore ride.again the acting wasn't anything amazing, Ali Larter wasn't very convincing, AJ Cook i thought lead the cast better then Devon Sawa in the first, Michael Landes was really monotone, Tony Todd did really good again though, and the rest of the cast i thought were actually more convincing then the leads.It wasn't a blockbuster but it was really fun to watch, and it was pretty gory, which doesn't really add much except for making the death scenes more fun to watch.its a pretty mediocre movie just like the first one but its well worth a watch.and thats why i give FINAL DESTINATION 2 8/10",Final Destination 2
153,Phantasm01,Just as good as the first,9,1 July 2006,"The movie opens by referencing the first film, Final Destination. We learn that this is the one year anniversary of the explosion of Flight 180 (the big event that triggered the events of Final Destination). A girl is sleeping in her room with the television on. The program is a news broadcast covering the anniversary. The guest on the show talks about how death has a design, a plan and if that plan is interrupted, people are more likely to die in strange ways just so that death's plan is not too messed up. This was also the plot of the first Final Destination movie and being a direct sequel, we know this will be a major part of Final Destination 2.After the scene setting the stage for the movie, we move into the actual plot line of the movie. Kimberly Corman (A.J. Cook) and 3 of her friends are taking a road trip. They are stopped on an on-ramp to get onto the freeway. We see Kimberly merge onto the road and keep driving, and there is a huge accident, visually impressive. Even this multiple vehicle (and I do mean multiple) accident comes up with some creative way to kill folks. Everyone dies. The scene shifts and Kimberly is still on the on-ramp. It was only a vision and it freaked her out. She stops her van sideways on the on-ramp and nobody gets on the highway. The officer trying to get Kimberly to calm down is a witness to a horrible accident that happens just as Kimberly said it would. She saved the life of everyone on the on-ramp, except for her three friends who are still in the van as it gets run down by a semi.Back at the police station, Kimberly is insisting that everyone who survived will die in a specific order and only the police officer on the scene believes her. It isn't until the first survivor dies that people start believing. To try to figure this out and find a way to beat it, Kimberly goes to get help from Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), the only survivor from Flight 180, and the only survivor from the aftermath. The rest of the movie follows Kimberly as she tries to save everyone from being randomly killed. She continues to have visions and picks up on signs of what may be coming.The real joy of this movie is in the creative and inventive death scenes. Sure, some are a little gruesome and I cringed a couple of times, but they were so well thought out that I couldn't wait to see how the next person would be killed. Final Destination 2 is not any different from the first movie, but because of the creativity of the deaths, I didn't mind at all. I like how the movie teased me with one kind of death but turned it into something completely different but equally impressive. Anytime I thought I figured out a death, the movie turned it to something else. It kept me on edge waiting for the next kill and the movie had a perfect flow to it. I'm not sure if the movie is better than the first, but it is just as good. If you've seen the first movie, you know exactly what you are getting into. If you haven't, this is a fun movie with a lot of creative kills. The movie exceeds the quality of its subject matter and is actually a pretty good movie.",Final Destination 2
154,WrathChld,Premonition,7,17 May 2006,"I just saw Final Destination 2 for the first time. I really enjoyed this movie. It is another attempt at the original's plot line about how you don't interfere with Death's plan. If you do, you are going to die eventually. It will stock you. You are never safe. This story does have an overlapping connection to its predecessor. There are plenty of cool death scenes. Please anyone reading this I am not trying to glorify death and say its cool, but within the contexts of a horror movie it is exactly that. I saw the original when it first came out so the first premonition seemed foreign to me. I liked that feeling because it added to the overall mood of the movie; although some of the connections to the first movie were not connecting as easily for me.This was a good horror flick. Take a load off while you're waiting for Death.Enjoy!",Final Destination 2
155,fibreoptic,Very Inventive,8,10 February 2004,"I take my hat off to this movie for having the most inventive killings ever in movie history. The guys behind them must have thought long and hard to be original and they succeeded! Almost every death shocked me and even though Final Destination 2 was a little scary, what made me the most scared (and paranoid) was the fact that any of these accidents could happen in real life! I still managed to leave my house this morning though hehe. What made this film fall short for me was the dodgy end. If you look at it with the information we are given throughout the movie that kid at the end shouldn't have died and the chick from the original died a cheap cheap death. Anyway, great movie, shame about the end. 8/10",Final Destination 2
156,TEAQUIEMORO,You Can't Cheat Death,9,3 April 2006,"This was a great sequel to the Final Destination,something too see that is gruesomely fun on this horrifying ride...it may be your last.Now death found new ways to kill the survivors from the pile-up on route 23.And here we find out Alex and Clears' way to die,one by a falling brick on his face.And one by an explosion on the hospital.This was better than the original Final Destination.It's better because they die with better gruesome accidents,nudity,and fun traps that leads to the victims life.They made more blood,action,and scary parts that we don't ever want to do that.In the Dentist scene I went there and been-careful for not the same thing to happen to me.I think it's just great when you go to the same accident in both Final Destination 1 and 2 that you remember what happen to the person.Then you look out if that's going to happen,that;s fun that you play a game with that or to scare a person with that.This will make you fasten your seat belts and to be on a look out on death.",Final Destination 2

I will not say anything else, other than someone had a real good imagination.  Other than that, pretty silly.  Yes, it did have it's moments, just as the first one did, but all in all, just about a carbon copy.  The layout of this has pretty much run its course by now.  I mean, how many times can you cheat the Grim Reaper?  Also, trying to keep track of the explanations of why all the deaths were happening, and who was next, just a little much.  But, not that bad of a movie.  Good entertainment.",Final Destination 2

159,Juan_from_Bogota,The story of a female Nostradamus,2,2 March 2007,"The story of a female Nostradamus version of the young one in final destination 1 is brought back here, the story is similar, only that the facts are quite different and the characters are new. Kimberly (aka female Nostradamus), has a lot of support with the people involved in the accident, this is different from the first movie; and when the things are ""easier"" for someone, the movie also lose some tension. The characters are all together supporting themselves trying to protect between them from their final destiny, with good visual effects and a lot of interesting and original deaths. (Sorry if this sound sadist!). Why i didn't like the movie?, well is just because in comparison with the first movie has very deficiencies (in my personal opinion): (1) This movie doesn't have the tension of the first, you see deaths but don't feel the level of drama of the first. (2) The story goes to a level at which you start to don't believe the events, are unreal and obvious at some moments. (3) You expect to see an even better movie when you already know the thematic, and you get disappointed when you watch an inferior movie. Well is my personal opinion but as always you have to see it for yourselves and make your own critic.ABOUT THE MOVIE: This story is held one year after the plane crash of the first movie, where Kimberly Corman (A. J. Cook) predicts a deadly accident on a high speed road, where a lot of people will die, she then stops and avoid death, her friends die in the accident after she stepped out of the car and it was crashed by another car, but with her, some other people escaped from dead; as the first movie, death follow each one of them to fulfill its purpose, they held together in order to stay alive; the group followed by dead are: police officer Thomas Burke (Michael Landes), Eugene Dix (Terrence T.C. Carson), a black boy skeptic of dead, Rory Peters (Jonathan Cherry), a rock style guy, Kat Jennings (Keegan Connor Tracy), a beautiful girl, Nora Carpenter (Lynda Boyd) a mother and her son Tim Carpenter (James Kirk), Evan Lewis (David Paetkau), Isabella Hudson (Justina Machado) and Shaina (Sarah Carter). They are aware that death will follow them, so Kimberly looks for Clear Rivers (Ali Larter) one survival of the plane accident to help them to avoid death, they together start to find clues and answers to escape from destiny, but this show being a rather difficult task.2/10!",Final Destination 2
160,tsmithjr,Excellent sequel a great thriller,10,15 February 2004,"If you liked ""Final Destination"" you'll really like ""Final Destination 2"". I remember the commercials for this one and was afraid they were ruining the thrill of this sequel.  So I didn't see it in the theaters.  I was wrong. If anything the commercials used the film footage to mislead you, so that the surprises were even greater.For what ""Final Destination 2"" is trying to do, they do it perfectly.  From the script, to the acting to the directing.  This was a tough score for me. While it doesn't rate up there with the the best films of all time.  In every aspect, they perfectly accomplished what they set out to do.  It's a Thriller, full of a lot of unpredictable turns and surprises, and with great action.  They wasted no time, the movie starts, they get right into it, and it keeps on at pretty much full pace until it's done.",Final Destination 2

162,ChrisTreborn,A Sequel that went beyond the Original,10,5 April 2005,"I first heard this movie on a news channel. When I saw this movie later, I knew why it was shown in so much important in the news channel. It is an Awesome movie in all means. This mind bulging twisted film rocked me to see the original but Believe me, the first one was just a teenage popcorn movie. This sequel was the greatest and scariest piece which showed true attitudes to the intended universe.Final Destination 2 (Spoilers******) Sequel to the 2000 original movie, director David R. Ellis tells the biggest story which has little to do with the first one. Daddy's girl Kimberly (A.J. Cook) was on her road trip with her friends. On the way she had a vision about an accident going to occur which involves her friends and herself and a six other travelers. Frightened Kimberly stops her car and other vehicles for saving their life. But things went wrong from the next movement. Soon she realize that she made a big mistake by saving them, because they are all now hunted by the Unseen Death! Scripted by J. Mackye Gruber and Erisc Bress for the story of Jeffrey Reddick and themselves tells the phenomenal narration of the greatest hunter Death. It was a kind of wicked work from them for creating a pulsing sequel from the original dull material. A.J. Cook is fabulous, so do Ali Larter. Also the soul created by Shirley Walker was brilliant, it adds tensions when it comes to serious and unexpected situations.All in all it's a great movie in every means. It has outstanding camera works, brilliant editing/FXs and importantly a great story.I gave this movie 10 out of 10Final Destination 2 = Too HOT with IDEAS.",Final Destination 2
163,Troy2Slick,Hopefully this isn't the Final installment for Final Destination...,10,3 May 2003,"I was expecting a heck of a lot out of this movie before my first time viewing it. I got what I had expected and a whole lot more. It has a pretty good storyline to work off of and the gore is top notch. It doesn't tease you like in a lot of horror flicks and switch scenes when someone is about to die or just let you hear a scream, oh no siree! Your stomach gets to curdle, blood gets to boil watching all of the deaths happen with much realism and goriness intact. Not since Dead Alive, have I seen a movie this gory and gritty. Thumbs up to the director and actors in this film. The acting was actually better than your usual horror/thriller flick. Very unpredictable fun and you aren't a sicko if you actually loved the death scenes. I'm a weak stomached man myself, but I enjoyed watching heads get impaled, electrocutions, decapitations, exploding body parts, blood, guts, intestines, you name it. I go by the nickname of Troy2Slick, I guess I should change that to Troy2Sick for loving this movie? Ahh, sue me! 3 1/2 *'s out of 4 *'s.",Final Destination 2

The deaths designed for each of the characters are clever and kind of funny, I found myself laughing more than jumping.However, I didn't like how they killed off Ali Larter's character from the original, to be honest, I would rather have had Kimberly or the cop die.Yeah, it has the same signature violent deaths from the first one, but this one isn't nearly as authentic or suspenseful, and the performances aren't that great.So I give FD2 a 2/4, for being a flawed yet kind of entertaining horror flick.",Final Destination 2
166,aquascape,Formulaic horror sequel,5,28 March 2018,"Seeing the original movie that started this franchise, ""Final Destination"" left me wanting more, but it spawned so many sequels it lost its touch and just became feed to the box-office machine. The sequel to it came quickly after the success of the first one, but I, myself, have not seen it until now and that is a lot of years apart from when I first watched the original.""Final Destination 2"" continues the supernatural premonition nightmares through the eyes of A. J. Cook, who witnesses a massive accident on a highway, for which the consequences will lead to a series of unfortunate events.Unlike the first movie, the script for its sequel seemed flawed and did not give the same thrill and exhilaration, this time feeling more like an X-Files episode as its predecessor was meant to be in terms of quality and production values.All in all, for a horror sequel in the 00's, ""Final Destination 2"" is a decent popcorn film.",Final Destination 2
167,Zingbot_9000,Scary??????,2,3 September 2003,"This movie wasn't scary. In order for a movie to be scary there needs to be suspense. When the movie gives the order of the deaths before they happen you know who gets it and when. Where's the suspense?This movie was just an excuse for gore. Nothing scary, funny or intelligent in this one. The writers of this movie thought they were clever but were far from it. I hated this movie so much.The plot was totally stupid. I got it after reading the box or hearing the characters say over and over that you can't cheat death. If you are supposed to die you are supposed to die no way to beat it. But even here they are inconsistent. So many plot holes in this one - the premise at least needs to work and it doesn't. Why was one character not able to comment suicide yet and another was? Answer: because it was convenient for the story.This movie was just an excuse to show as much gore as possible. They would try to scare you that one gory thing would happen but another did. Very tasteless excuse to be as gory as possible. Why couldn't death just make someone stop breathing? No, they had to torture someone by having them go through hell at the dentist office then squash them like a tomato - a kid none the less. They had to totally drag out a decapitation. Even the crash scene at the beginning was way over done - everyone had to die a gross way in the crash.My stepson said it best: I've seen this movie before. It was called Final Destination 1. I myself didn't see Final Destination 1 before, but believe it because nothing in this movie seemed clever even watching this sequel to an 'original' movie I hadn't seen.At least in Friday the 13th there was Jason, in Night Mare on Elmstreet there was Freddy, in Halloween there was Michael Meyers, and even in Childs Play there was Chuckie - there was no visible bad guy in this one.This movie was total garbage even by horror movie standards. I felt disgusted with myself for even watching this crap. A friend borrowed me this DVD - thank god it was his money not mine. If you want to see horror and be scared see Freddy vs Jason instead of this piece of garbage. Did I say I HATED this movie yet???",Final Destination 2

We find that Death shows a person signs about what's going to happen before It does.           Final Destination 2 does the same thing but add's very interesting twists to it. FD2 takes off with a horrific Car accident, and when one of the Accident's would be statistic's see what's in store for them...

172,JohnLennon1985,The first one made me jump. This one made me laugh.,7,17 February 2003,"The first Final Destination was excellent. It was well-written, well-acted, well-executed. It focused more on the story than it did on the killings. Final Destination 2 was excellent in a different way. It was well-written, well-executed, and focused on the blood and guts. Notice I didn't mention the acting, which was for the most part, MST3K-worthy.Story: 9/10. The story was very good. There were no inconsistencies from the first movie, and at least they had a very good reason for not using most of the original cast. Anyone who saw the first movie would know why. Kimberly Corman (A.J. Cook) has a premonition that there's going to be a major pile-up on the freeway. Like in the first movie, she stops her car in the middle of the street, preventing the people who were SUPPOSED to be involved in the pileup from being involved in the pileup. Her premonition comes true, and a rift is caused in death's design... again. Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), being the sole survivor of the first movie, becomes the experienced know-it-all who gives advice to the doomed people, who begin to die bizarre deaths, just like in the first movie (only bloodier)Characters: 3/10. Many of them were unoriginal. One of them is a hardcore druggie. Really, where have we seen that before, besides almost every movie in the horror genre? Acting: 4/10. A.J. Cook's performance was decent, as was Ali Larter's. The rest actually made the movie laughable, especially Terrance ""T.C."" Carson, who I found to be unintentionally hilarious. Execution: 10/10. The blood and guts spilled in this movie make it too good to be bashed, especially when the entire audience cheered whenever someone died. I awaited the deaths of the characters like one would await an FMV sequence in a Playstation game. The movie was executed so well that as much as I try, I can't hate it.Final Destination 2 fails to live up to its predecessor, but can we really name more than two sequels that do? In all, while I DID laugh at the movie, it was very good.Final Score: 6.5/10.",Final Destination 2
173,c_p_c,"A ""Bloody"" Good Time",7,17 February 2003,"First off, to enjoy this movie you have to take it for face value.  It is not attempting to be like THE RING or anything of that matter.  This movie is clearly made so the audience can watch people die in crazy ways (I know its a little twisted).  It really in a way is a comedic/horror picture.Unlike its predecessor, this movie realized the farfetched plot and runs with it.  The first one was good, but it took its topic to seriously.  The deaths are overly creative and drawn out to great legths in some cases, all given for shock value.  Before long the audience finds itself, ""I wonder how the next person is going to die?""  It brings about a lot of fun anticipation.  This sequel is good in part due to the fact that is doesn't have much to live up to, I mean the first movie was about the same thing, except in the sequel ""Death"" becomes a little more creative. 
The acting talent is none to remember, but that is what makes it fun is the fact that you don't care to much about the characters as they get picked off.  The movie does throw a few plot twists in the mix just to make things more interesting, and it works.Beware, this movie isn't for those with weak stomachs.  Along with the elaborate death scenes comes a very elaborate amount of blood.  Clearly the filmakers were hoping to win on shock value, and in this case they do.  The opening crash sequence is like none I have seen before.  IT is absolutely amazing and becomes very intense.This movie is fun.  It is in no way a movie that will go down on the top 10 horror movies of all time, but for what the filmakers were trying to achieve, they did a great job.For a great ""bloody"" time at the movies, I give FINAL DESTINATIOn 2 a 7/10.",Final Destination 2
174,headfulofghosts126,"Serves its purpose very, very well",8,1 February 2003,"To be honest, I don't remember enjoying the first Final Destination all that much. There are only a few things I even remember about the movie. So last night when I went to the theatre, it was not with the intentions of sitting through the sequel. Alas, the movie I wanted to see was sold out and this one was starting relatively soon. You know what? I'm really glad I saw this movie.I enjoyed this much more than the first film. Entertaining, funny, suspenseful... all the things a lot of these teen horror flicks try to be and fall short of. Sure the acting isn't fantastic and some of the dialouge is laughable, but L.A. Confidential this ain't. It's a movie about death catching up with people. So surprise... death is the star. Everyone complaining about the gore should have their heads examined. What kind of movie did you think you'd be seeing? The fact is that when you sit through a movie like FD2, it should be with the understanding that these movies ARE about who gets it next and how. There was zero character development. The music was less than spectacular. The editing was slightly amateurish. But the impact of the death scenes was so powerful that the rest of this becomes incidental. It's impossible not to leave this movie looking over your shoulder and feeling completely paranoid about a split second death you can't see coming. I for one did not want to drive home after that opening sequence (which was unbelievably well done!). This is a popcorn film. It had one goal. I think it accomplished it masterfully.

I love armchair death and even more armchair killing and murder. It may be the water I drink? Anyway it's a good fun movie to watch while eating dinner.

179,rolandddd,Less horror than expected,6,19 June 2013,"When I was a kid I used to play a game called The Incredible machine. Basically, you had to build what is called a Rube Goldberg machine, a device which carries out a simple task in an over-elaborate way. This is the way this movie works, the characters meet their ends in bizarre, creative and elaborate ways.The plot pretty much follows the first part of the series. Criminal Minds-regular AJ Cook plays Kimberly Corman, who gets a premonition and saves a couple of people from certain death in the form of a huge highway pile-up. Of course it was their destiny to die and death will not be fooled.Clear Rivers is kept from the first film, clearly for exposition purposes. She informs the main characters of basically what happened in the first movie, the death list and all. Her character is one of the more interesting in the movie. As is Tony Todd's undertaker character, and it is a waste that his part is so small.I enjoyed the first movie because I felt the premise felt fresh, and though it had flaws it was pretty enjoyable. This movie is basically just more of the same. The horror elements are all but gone, the emphasis is instead placed on the impressive crash scene at the beginning and the elaborate deaths, which makes this more of a gore-action-comedy than a horror movie. The acting is also pretty bad, AJ Cook is decent enough but many other performances are way over-the-top.",Final Destination 2
180,kidwltm,"Worked In The 1st Movie, Fails Miserably In The 2nd",4,22 July 2003,"Final Destination is exactly the same idea as the first (obviously), and that's not bad.  But the execution, unlike the first one, leaves us with another bland horror film.  First off, this time the survivors are complete strangers, so there is no bond between characters, and we feel nothing for one based on the outcome of another.  They tried to fill it in with some hokey love story, but it just wasn't working.  And brining back Clear Rivers was a bad idea.  It made it way too simple for the people to understand what was going on, and was pretty much put in there to help speed up the writer's poor idea for cheating death.  It's also another movie in a long line since 6th Sense that just uselessly throws plot twist after plot twist at you in order to convince you it's really a smart and deftly crafted thriller.  It's not.  The ""big twists"" are anitclimatic.  The death scenes were much more far fetched than last time, but some are still fun to watch.  It's a little gore happy, but that's expected from a horror sequel.  They have to make up for the lack of story from the predecessor, so they just whip out the 'ol ultra violence.  The cast is nothing better than average.  The lead girl was pretty bad though. Sadly, Tony Todd is still gives the best performance, despite being the movie for about 5 minutes.  David R. Ellis is just a bland director.  Capable, sure, but bland.  It's a throwaway sequel.  It takes a the good idea the first one had and throws it away in favor of violent death scenes, which are cool at times and a part of any good horror film, but should not be the main focus.  Sure to give teenie boppers a good scare, but any else should think twice about seeing this.3.5/10*/ * * * *",Final Destination 2

Like a girl has visions about these events happening in a death sequence and tries to stop it but can not do it in time to save her friends and people she had saved from certain death. I was happy that Clear Rivers was back(she was last seen in the previous film in Paris). But the fact that she was isolating herself from death list was kinda bad because she would have eventually died anyway. I hated the way that there were visions of different deaths in the film but the symbols come on, no one wants to see that. I was happy that there were new deaths in the film and that the character Clear had finally come to see death face to face again and then died. I hope that the movie next in line to this is better than this and way more impossible death scenes. I just hope that the characters in this film who had survived won't be back.

It gets a quick reaction, like, ooh, I feel your  pain man.  FINAL DESTINATION 2 is a 90 minute or so string of those painful shots,  as each character one by one meets an unfortunate death by household  appliance. Bodies are slammed by trucks, heads are impaled, and limbs  fly through the air. When one of the characters dies when her car's  airbag explodes out of nowhere, I blurted ""Yeah! Wow, did they do  that??? Yeah, they DID do that. Right on!""  Although the film has a very serious atmosphere about it, what with the  creepy score and people sincerely freaking out and everything, it still  retains a campy humor about it buried beneath its high-budget exterior.  Many movies would shy away from smashing up plastic ketchup-filled  dummies, opting instead to avoid the gore. Not FINAL DESTINATION 2!  This movie is an honest approach to movie-making, hearkening back to  the day when you got together with friends and said, ""Okay, in this  scene we cut to the dummy falling off the building, it's run over by a  Mack truck, and it splatters chunks of blood all over that Oldsmobile  over there.""  As for the premise behind FINAL DESTINATION 2, how do I put it into  words? A.J. Cook has premonitions that people died in a nasty pileup on  the highway. Thing is, this never happened. And ... she continues to  have premonitions that those same people will die in due time. Those  people eventually die. Did I get that right? The universal law of  nature is that, well, Death sometimes misses its mark and has to fix  its mistakes (which usually involves electrical equipment getting wet  and other freak accidents of home improvement). If this all sounds  convoluted, watch the movie. You'll see what I mean.  The premise of FINAL DESTINATION 2, as much potential as it might have,  doesn't make much sense and is pretty hokey, but if you medicate your  inquisitive mind with heavy sedatives, you'll be able to look past the  flimsy premise and enjoy the movie.

(If they weren't supposed to ""cheat"" death, then why was he given the vision to begin with?)This sequel follows the same formula, but I must say, this one does it much better. The deaths, though quite gruesome, have an ""Omen"" kind of style, and it's actually intriguing to watch the series of innocuous events that cleverly culminate in the death of each person. Also, the director and writer include fake-outs to keep you off guard. The story is also more involved and complex, subtly tying into the first movie.

I quite liked the original yet failed to see the big fuss made over it. While the premise was indeed original and indeed clever the execution I fealt although not terrible could have been better. This however although not perfect is slightly better than it's predecessor. I had better warn those though who are screamish not to watch it as it's very gory. It's little wonder that it recieved a 15 certificate here in the UK. It makes you wonder about the judgement of those members of the BBFC who gave this movie the certificate it recieved. After all Scream which recieved an 18 certificate is not as graphic as what this was. As I was just about to go in the cinema I bumped into a group of friends who had just come out of a previous screening and to say one of them was shaken up was an understatemant. He had to get into a taxi as there was no way he was going to walk home. It could be argued that it's unnecessarily gory and should have left more to the imagination. That said however it does lend more impact to the deaths when they occur. Some deaths are actually quite amusing while at the samt time being horrific. The movie is also noteworthy of breaking one of the great tabbo's. The on screen deaths of a fifthteen year old boy. What makes it even more surprising or shocking is how ghastly his death is. The plot throws in a good few red herrings not only about how people are going to die but how to defeat Death itself. This is slightly lighter than the original and doesn't seem to take itself too seriously. The witty dialogue is carried off well by an able enough cast though I have to agree with one person commenting on the reactions to some of the deaths not being too convincing. Paticulary the mother who witnesses her son being crushed. I personally fealt she would have been even more hysterrical than what she was. The explanations to certian plot points could have better explained as well. Plus the premonitions as a plot device are used too much. It also leaves you wondering why the heroine has them in the first place. If they were all meant to die in the first place why was she given these visions. Devon Sawas character in the original after all only ever had the one after all. The writers though have to be complimented on how they tied in the movie with the original. They could have just done the easy thing and made a film with the same premise but was not linked at all to the previous movie. What I also liked about this and the original is the fact that from the start of the movie the characters are quite simply doomed. Like at the end of the first movie even though there are two of the characters still alive you know eventually that number is going to come up. Good doesn't win over in the end. Unlike Freddy, Jason and the like. You cannot stop this villain. It's a battlle where there can only be one winner. Final Rating: * * * *",Final Destination 2

So will they be able to cheat death again?  While it isn't necessary, it's probably a good idea to watch the first installment before watching this one.For all those writers out there who are trying to write a successful scary movie, take notes.  Admittedly, you might not jump out of your pants, but there's only a couple good scares in 'The Ring' and THAT worked.  Be forewarned, the deaths dance on the line of gruesome and good taste, but they're executed (pun intended) perfectly.  Always trying to guess what's gonna happen next, you'll find yourself half-hoping they'll cheat death, and half-hoping you've correctly guessed how the next person will buy the farm.Now, there was the requisite malarky when it came time to ask the question, ""How do we beat Death?""; but don't worry it's rather brief.  The cast does a good job and you never quite get a feel of how long each character is gonna last, which is good.Who knows?

Scare where the killer jumps out of the shadows or there is a period of inactivity followed by someone jumping in through a window or some crap like that. To be honest I find that to be a cheap scare when done alone. In ""The Exorcist"" there was an absence of the BOOO! Scare because they knew that the audience would be scared by what was happening on screen, the horror of the situation.  This is what I believe this movie accomplishes an actual good mix of foreboding and the BOOO! Scare. The movie is set up so you think you know what's going to happen then it kind of tilts it on it's ear. Most of the deaths follow a system that worked for me... The Set-up - Foreboding - The Fake out - Relief - BOO! Or in some cases just plain old surprise.

The concept works, and it works not because you care for the characters, you won't. It's because the deaths are so violent and abrupt that you get nervous waiting for them to happen. Although the dialogue and thoughts on death with everyone retelling stories got annoying. The characters only need to be scared sh*tless, (you don't need them spouting their philosophies on death). I still think it works - the film acknowledges the audience is trying to work out how each person dies and tries to play with that expectation. That tension, and the fact the movie knows its limits means I'd watch a 3rd 'Final' Destination - although next time some more humor would help make it that much more tense.

It's hard to put words to it but the wrenching up of the nerves by the filmmakers took a lot of thought and effort. Each vehicle has a little inter-related ""something-or-other"" going on that is causing anxiety in the viewer (for me anyway). And the other factors. The heavy holiday traffic. The wet pavement. Inconsiderate drivers. Teenagers not taking any of it very seriously. Then IT starts! The pile up from HELL. Oh my gosh, I can watch it over and over again.

197,colaof,A Worthy Successor to the First Film!,6,23 April 2016,"Judging from the other reviews it seems most people either love this movie, or flat out hate it. I fall somewhere in between. I saw the first Final Destination in theaters, and at the time thought it was one of the better horror movies I'd seen. I no longer feel that way, although I do think it's one of the better ones to come out of the late 90's/early 2000's period. In the first one I felt like the lead Devon Sawa overdid it a little bit, in turn making the movie more unbelievable every time I watch it. While I wouldn't go so far as to say that Final Destination 2 is better, I will say that I think A.J. Cook played a better/more believable lead. Aside from her I liked Michael Landes as the cop, but the rest of the cast left a lot to be desired. Ali Larter, who played Clear in the first movie, returns for the sequel helping to bridge the two stories together. Clear was my favorite character in the first, so it was nice to see her return. The deaths are much more elaborate in this one, and quite gruesome. Which shouldn't come as a surprise considering that by that time all horror movies had become disgustingly brutal. A lot of people seem to think that that's the appeal of horror movies, but it's not. At least not for me. I've always been more interested in the plot/story aspect, and one thing I've always liked about the Final Destination series is that they make you think. I'm not saying the deaths aren't cool, because they are, and considering how lackluster I found this supporting cast to be I got much more enjoyment out of watching their untimely demise than I would have had the characters been more likable. If you liked the first Final Destination chances are you'll like the second. That's about all I can say without giving anything away. I'd recommend it to any horror fan though. Instead of some deranged psychopath tormenting the characters, it's death itself. Which is pretty cool if you stop and think about it. As a horror fan I'd like to rate it higher, but the supporting cast is so disappointing that I just can't bring myself to do it. Although Ali Larter, A.J. Cook, and Michael Landes carry the others as best they can, it's still not enough to justify a rating higher than a 6 for me. As far as early 2000's horror goes though, this is one of the best, and without question a worthy successor to the first film.",Final Destination 2

To be fair it is a crying wonder how final destination 2 merited anything less than an 18 certificate yet managed a 15. I am 16 years old and this is one of the most visually repulsive films i have EVER SEEN.The storyline to say the least is mediocre at best but this film is just pure entertainment. Despite the moments of grotesque gore such as people getting their heads decapitated by a lift and impaled by ladders and crushed into a thousand pieces by pained glass, it is great to watch. Final Destitation 2 really is a film of consistent foreboding in that whatever comes next, you have been expecting but not in the fashion that it does. The acting again is mediocre and far from special and overall this fails as a film to really frighten you, however in terms of shocking you with extreme violence FS2 excels. I think if you are looking for a scary horror film then Fs2 isn't really a recommended choice, however if you love films with ridiculous gore this should be top of the list. I am the type of person who loves such films as Shawshank and LOTR but i feel it never hurts to see the occasional gory shocker.

Well this film proves that,7,22 March 2008,"I am a huge fan of the final destination movies and had seen the first and the third and thought I better fill in the gap and watch this one. I enjoyed it a lot. The car pile up that happens at the beginning was amazing to watch, because it was explosion after explosion and crash after crash, it was just non stop. After that it seemed to slow down a bit though, until we got to Evan Lewis' death. His death is definitely the most tense, which is a shame because it would've been a nice ending death, but it was the first. With his death you just never know when he's going to die, because there are so many things he can die from and then he dies in the way you least expect. His death is so tense, every move he made and every little thing he did I was almost screaming at the screen telling him not to. Most deaths as well you never see coming and if you do see them coming you don't think they're going to turn out the way they do. It's great stuff to watch for the first time, because you're looking for the clues and almost talking to the characters. For me the actors could've been cast a bit better. Bringing back Clear Rivers was definitely the best thing they could've done. If she wasn't in it, the acting would've let the film down. Sadly the character worst cast was the main girl, Kimberly. Her reactions to some of the deaths was way to unemotional. A person on deaths list gave a long moving speech to her about her throwing away anything of his that would break his mothers heart after he died, then she witnesses him getting sliced into three or four parts by a wire fence and all she can do is raise her hand to her mouth for about two seconds and not look shocked at all. For me the acting wasn't great coming from her, but the film was still great. Overall a highly enjoyable film, and best of all was how largely it linked back to the first, mentioning all the past characters names and having pictures of them everywhere, I really liked that effect. This film is better than the first, but not as good as the third, but if you love the final destination series, there is nothing not to like about this film.",Final Destination 2

202,bibleboyiam,Somewhat Enjoyable but Totally Ridiculous,2,28 July 2003,"I eagerly awaited the arrival of this film on video so that I could see it for a low price( judging from the stupidity of the original, this installment could not be worth $8.75). Before the film came out on video I read through quite a few of the reviews written on this web site for Final Destination 2, and judging from the general consensus, one would be led to believe that this film is actually a worthwhile movie. When July 22nd came around, and the video stores were stocked full, I actually felt a sense of excitement while driving to get it. So I rented the DVD version, took it home, and 15 minutes into the film I could have SWORN that I was watching the original movie, except for the fact that the characters were dying on the freeway, and not in the sky. I mean give me a Goddamn break, absolutely no originality or variation from the original. The only, and I mean ONLY reason why I didnt go back to the store and demand my 4 dollars back was because of the interesting/gory yet highly unrealistic deaths that the characters are led to.Anyone who took this movie seriously, or that felt any emotion other than simultaneous amusement and disgust should be hung naked by their eyelids with a laughing audience throwing rotten fruit at their backsides. I vaguely remember one reviewer's comment that any of these things could happen to any of us at anytime. This individual should be banned from this website for the rest of their life!! How could anyone in their right mind think that this movie is credible!?! The idea that some invisible force kills people and that death has a plan for all of us is absolutely moronic...... but I do realize that it was simply made for our entertainment.
My overall recommendation: Rent it once, but try to convince somebody else to pay for it, i.e. a friend, parent, or significant other. Under no circumstances should anyone purchase this movie, and anyone who has the desire to watch this movie more than once had better have a good excuse, such as to simply watch the death sequences again, because if you watch this movie twice for enjoyment you will have to live the rest of your life knowing that your a complete idiot.

203,ghostface18,VERY SUSPENSEFUL AND DOWNRIGHT DISTURBING,9,31 January 2003,"NOTE:  SPOILERSI saw this movie after very much enjoying the first one, even though this second one was panned by critics.  I must say that it was one of the most suspenseful as well as disturbing movies I have seen.  Even though the beginning and end scenes are very grotesque, they are inventive, wonderful stunts/special effects, and again, a great ending.  Warning:  as said in the reason for the R rating, this is a very graphic and realistic movie and portrayal of death, more so than the first one.  It has all of the elements of the FD1, but more suspenseful, more gory, and generally much better. Plus, there is a link between both movies. In the opening accident sequence, in addition to wonderfully done stunts, there is A LOT of blood and gore.  A man is decapitated by a flying log, there are many explosions, a man is squashed by his motorcycle. Later on, a man is impaled by the leg of an escape ladder.  After chasing pigeons, a young boy is smashed by a heavy sheet of glass and you can see blood and body matter clearly.  Another man is chopped in half and after seeing his body fall apart, we see his intestines. Last, although it is a sad and disturbing scene (because it involves the graphics death of a young boy), the ending is beautifully done (the death is not beautiful, just the way it was executed) with a dash of humor.  I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone, especially those who are a fan of horror movies.  Just again, a note of warning, this is a very violent, graphics, gory, and realistic movie.  Praise to the great job of the visual effects and the stuntmen.",Final Destination 2
204,arlum_meow,not better than the original but a good sequel.,6,29 July 2012,"final destination takes place with Kimberly having a premonition about there's going to be a huge pile up with all her friends involved and eventually everyone would die in the order death set out. after she blocks the high way of and trys to save the people that were meant to die. the real action starts with her horrifying premonition coming true, so she saves the strangers that were meant to die but sadly not her friends which were also part of deaths list.after one of the survivors dies in a freak accident Kimberly gets suspicious and thinks that history is repeating its self. so later on in the movie goes to visit the only survivor of flight 180 CLAIRE is now in an asylum the only place she is safe from death.Claire finally decides to face up to her demons to help Kimberly save the survious of the pile up that think there safe when actually death wont stop till there all dead.final destination 2 is not better than the original for these following reasons.................1) mainly when a film ends in a cliff hanger it usually means that the 2nd film will take straight after the 1st film but final destination 2 fails to do that.2) because it brings nothing new to the table just the same plot as the first but with mire gory deaths.3) also final destination was very predictable from beginning to end if I'm very honest unlike final destination 1 you know whats coming round the corner and you know who deaths after next.but thats not to say to that final destination wasn't a good film because it didn't fail to impress with the deaths and the jokes.another thing i loved about final destination 2 is that they made Claire mad and crazy not just the quite teen she was back in final destianiton. i think they made a jolly good decision to bring a survivor from the previous film turnt mad and obsessed with death now that it took all her friends away from her. if they didn't have Claire then final destination 2 would have failed BIG TIME.overall final destination deserves a 6.5/10",Final Destination 2
205,krissikrissa,Is it wrong to like death scenes?,3,24 July 2010,"I am going to get straight to the point because we all know where this is going. Final Destination 2 is a really bad movie in most areas and she doesn't really try to hide it. Acting, direction, script, just name it, it's all bad in the words strongest meaning. In some places she is like the earlier film, innocent fun and pretty cool death scenes even though the quality is a bit low.Final Destination 2 Is just the most pointless sequel to a movie ever! She connects to the first one a little bit but not a lot happens with the plot they just keep picking them off, one at a time and most of it repetitive. Sometimes you even feel you're watching the first one again -- only with funnier (yes I said funnier) death scenes This film is not as entertainingly dark as the first one (Not like that's a surprise -- former X-files guys behind that one). Rather boringly bright and that dragged the movie a little down in the ratings for me. But most of the work goes into the disgustingly awesome kill scenes and nothing else unfortunately. Maybe that doesn't sound appropriate but it's all apart of the Final Destination ride and if you don't like it, get of it! The accidents scenes are a lot better here then in the earlier film but over all this is a mild disappointment with a couple of laughs.But how can you not laugh at the final death scene? Had to mention it! 3/10",Final Destination 2
206,ScottyJBD,Waaaaaaaaaay better than the first,10,31 January 2003,"Ive never liked a movie before, had a sequel come out, seen it, and then walked out liking the sequel 10 times better than the first, not to mention the first was very original, and thats hard to come by these days.This movie NEVER lets up, its death after death after death, and just when you thought it was time for a breather, someone dies.Some might think the movie will be too predictable, but its amazing at how unpredictable it turned out to be. First you think someones done for, they survive, only to die an instant later, completely off guard.This is the most entertaining and intense movie ive seen in a very long time, and with the success of this, Final Destination 3 should be pretty solid, but i dont know, this movie was so good, that it doesnt leave a lot of hope for the 3rd, no chance itll even come close to surpassing this.Best sequel ive seen in years, 10/10",Final Destination 2

208,danila_1,A solid thriller,9,6 June 2003,"The film is good. Unlike the Final Destination, there is actually a story (and pretty decent one), nicely tied to the events in the first film. There isn't much character development, but then the film's point is different, it is to show the omnipresence of death and the characters' encounters with it. And it does that brilliantly. Especially the ""encounters"". Death scenes are very scary and very impressive. The opening episode is amazing. To imagine the quality and intensity of the action, think about action scenes in the Matrix: Reloaded (like Burly Brawl), only with people dying.Even more impressive is tension build-up in several other episodes. The film frightens us most by showing how close are people to death in everyday life. The gas station episode shows it best. Cars narrowly miss each other, a man drops a gas-cylinder, dogs strain at leads. In that moment it is scary to see just a man fixing a lamp. Death is always around the corner, is always waiting for us to make a mistake. You can't help but think (half-seriously, but nevertheless) about miriads of small mistakes you make every day. Dropping a knife into the drawer, looking for the light-switch in the dark, holding a sharp object close to your face. Plain scary. And that even without mistakes made by others that can kill you just as well. Boo! :)Most of the film is downright scary, but there are few darkly humorous scenes. These scenes(only a few, mind you) didn't improve the film, but didn't harm it either. One may like or dislike it, but this is a valid writer's/director's creative choice and we just have to accept it.S P O I L E R: (Minor) I personally think that every lift (elevator) must have photoelectric cells in the doors (that prevent them from closing if something is there) and a big red stop button on the panel that immediately stops the lift when pressed. I nearly lost my dog once THAT way, but that red button saved it. If the lift that you need to use doesn't meet these standards of safety, you might be better off using the stairs.",Final Destination 2
209,angrymidget19,Actually better than the first - but not by much,7,30 June 2006,"Like the first, this movie is based on someone, namely Kimberly Corman (Cook) having a premonition of a major pileup on the road. She parks her SUV, blocking both lanes, saving the lives of many people. But then Death starts to kill them off in a gruesome fashion once more. This movie features Ali Larter as Clear Rivers again, who voluntarily had herself locked in an insane asylum where Death ""couldn't get her"". The director also managed to sneak in a creepy reference between the characters in this movie and the characters in the first.I actually liked this movie, despite how the plot sounds dumb when you first hear it. This movie accomplished what the first tried so hard at, and came so close to. The death scenes are chains of events, not just a half second of someone getting their **** ruined by a bus. It has a lot of action, good special effects, a great tie in between the two movies, and more interesting deaths (like sliced by a barbed wire fence). The actors have an okay range of emotions, and deliver good performances. This movie's got some good gore too, but nothing someone who's seen a few slashers can't take.",Final Destination 2
210,Anyoneatnowhere,Sucked,2,2 January 2008,"Yeah this movie was about as lame as a teen-thriller flick can get. The accident at the start was cool because it was so ridiculously over the top but you soon realise that they're trying to be serious when they show you stuff like that. Just before it we see a series of signs that something bad is going to happen... like a kid banging together toy trucks. Whatever could that mean? Some of the deaths are so unbelievable that no amount of editing, camera shaking and screaming is going to convince me of what's about to happen. Like the lady that gets decapitated in the elevator. Her pony or plait gets caught on pile of prosthetic limbs?! If there were any good parts I might have missed them because I stopped paying attention about 20 mins into the movie. The plot is recycled Hollywood garbage and acting isn't any better. The only thing that kept me watching was the hope that the main characters would soon die in some agonising way and put me out of my misery.I do like to give films a chance to impress me, which is why I watch them (even bad ones) all the way through. This, though, was utter s hite.",Final Destination 2
211,davishasrisen,the best movie of this year,9,1 February 2003,This movie is by far the best movie of the year. I loved it it was scarier than the ring by far. It had suspense and comedy. I loved every death scene. The special effects were awesome and the violence was so gory it made you laugh. The part with the pigeons is awesome. I was rooting for death the whole time. The BBQ scene is so funny at the end. I never expected this from this movie.,Final Destination 2
212,Stevieheuge,Horror makes way for humour and gore,5,30 July 2004,"Final Destination was a decent film. Original idea, pretty suspenseful directing, and some death scenes that while inventive, were creepy to boot.This time around, with a new director and a new approach, we get a very different film. The first movie was a horror - this is'nt. In fact its not even a thriller, its basically a load of silly dialogue acted out badly by very silly actors, with some dead people in-between. The thing is, that doesn't make the movie all that bad - The deaths and the gore are the pay-offs, and great care has been taken to ensure that all of them would get a great reaction from a packed cinema theatre.The car pile up at the start is bone crunchingly violent, with buckets of blood being splattered everywhere - and its very entertaining stuff.
Various methods have been used here for the subsequent death scenes (CG, green screens, puppets, models) but it all cuts together very well, and most of the deaths would have your average cinema audience whooping with crimson tainted delight...The impressive trickery used in killing off each character, intertwining supsense and surprise, is so effective, that many people will come away from this film forgetting that there wasn't actually anything else good about it - apart from the eye candy of course.Worth a watch - you'll recoil in disgust and laugh more than you would watching most movies of this genre. try to catch it before you die.",Final Destination 2
213,jaffakree340,"Horrendous, sadistic, and downright wrong.",1,11 August 2003,"The level of gore, guts, blood, and violence in this film inspires me with yet more hatred of human society. To think that anyone can get off on watching people get slaughtered like that sickens me, and I hope the producers of this movie burn in hell (and I'm not even religious) for the images they put before us. Makes CSI look like Sesame Street. A flat out F, 0 out of 5 stars.",Final Destination 2
214,bendy392,Actually a pretty good sequel.,6,16 October 2014,"After the financial success hit of the first Final Destination, a sequel had to be thought up. And seeing how the first movie creates potential for a sequel, it seems fitting that another one had to be made and we get Final Destination 2. Yep. Death is at it again. But the question is did they clean up their mistakes from the first film? Did they decide to make the deaths more serious? Are more things explained in this movie as a sequel should do? The answer to the last question. YES. More things are actually explained! That's right. I really liked this movie. I mean, okay yeah, it's not a masterpiece. Miles from it, in fact. But I think it's a very loyal sequel with more things to offer.Here's the story. Kimberly, played by AJ Cook, is taking a road trip with her friends on the interstate. But an eighteen wheeler carrying a bunch of logs passes by. The logs fall off and crash into countless cars, causing a massive pileup, killing many innocents. But this turns out to be a vision of Kimberly's and she blocks the ramp to the interstate to stop several motorists from entering the interstate. The pileup ensues and Kimberly, along with those who were meant to die in the pileup survives. Kimberly believes that all of this is the same thing as the events of the first film in which Death is now after the lucky ones. Desperate to find answers, Kimberly goes to the only survivor of the first film, Clear Rivers, played by Ali Larter. Yeah, Alex died in between films due to offscreen syndrome. Clear Rivers decides to help Kimberly and the others to find a way to stop Death and find more information about why this is all happening.As you can see, this movie has a very strong connection to the first film—as a sequel should. And more things are explained, like how Death is doing all this. I like how Kimberly goes to Clear Rivers for answers. I like how they demand answers from the mortician, who was very knowledgeable from the first film about how to defeat Death. I like how the survivors become more and more concerned as the deaths excess. Yeah, I think the characters are better in this movie. I mean, yeah, they're stupid in their own way, but I like how involved they get near the end, even the cop. Yeah! A cop actually gets involved in the horror movie and you know what? He believes Kimberly and immediately tries to find answers after the pileup and ends up helping the survivors early on. There's even a deleted scene where the mortician explains how Death works to bring balance in the universe. I just found that really fascinating.Okay, so what's the not so good stuff? Well...like the first film, the deaths are still stupid. In fact, in retrospect, they're goofier in this one. Yeah, they're Loony Tunes territory and more far-fetched. Also, another big change in this film in contrast to the first one is that this movie seems to be leaning towards a little bit of comedy. I guess you can say that since the deaths were ludicrous in the first film, they decided ""why not? Make it somewhat comedic. Taking it too seriously would make it even goofier."" And the direction they take with the movie just makes itwell, fun. But they don't make it where it's completely a comedy; there's still some suspense in the mix when they try to find more information. Yeah, it's not scary. Just fun.I guess I'm a big sucker for this movie, but seeing how they treat this movie, they really did try to make it a true sequel. Is it stupid at times? Oh yeah. Are the deaths any better? No. But as far as story and characters go, I think it's an advance from the first movie. I know this had a mixed reaction from people, so you can say I'm a fan of this movie. I liked it, despite its mistakes. Next time it's on TV, give it a shot and see for yourself. Justnot while driving.",Final Destination 2

I thought that this film relied a lot on the original and virtually had the same pace and ideas, just put into new stunts and gore though. for instance when the stoner guy is chopped up by the wire fence i felt De ja vu only an hour later and realised that it was similar to Seann Scott's death in the original; where you see seann's head slide apart you see this guys body fall apart in the same style and position.  The film isnt scary at all, its funny! And the characters arent developed enough to want to see them make it. The film has obviously had some interesting plot twists though, it is just very hard for a film to live up to the origininality of the first i think. When i first heard that a sequel was being planned i thought "" oh good, they're gonna ruin the story"" but i was wrong and think it is definatly worth seeing and will give some good entertainment.RATING: 6 out of 10",Final Destination 2
218,natport19,"not a bad horror movie, but...",5,6 April 2003,"The battle between fate and free will has been explored in much of literature and film.  Whereas Minority Report, the best picture of last year, examined the idea through large plot twists and the human emotions of its main characters, Final Destination 2 strives to do so through the impaling of large intestines and main arteries.  What culminates is not a bad horror film-it is better than its predecessor-but its reliance on the genre of horror sequels leads to its inevitable demise.With the exception of Willard, all of the horror movies released this year (Darkness Falls, Dreamcatcher, and now Final Destination 2) have had their strongest moments in the film's opening minutes.  Aside from obvious flaws in Ellis' direction, the sequence on the highway, from what most of the trailer is derived, stands out as the film's highlight.  The scenes after it should be renamed Final Destination Too, because the whole plot is the first movie.  The only exception is that it does not waste its time developing characters that we know will be killed off anyway.It is not essential to have any knowledge of the happenings in Final Destination.  The screenplay's exposition takes place in between both films, and all the returning plot elements are exhaustingly expressed through cheesy dialogue.  Through an overdose of foreshadowing, the predictability factor is just as high as its elements of surprise.  This unevenness hints at yet another sequel in the film's resolution-if it can be called that.**1/2 out of ****",Final Destination 2
219,jaxstephens,"Entertaining, but not as effective as the original.",7,2 February 2003,"Okay, so sequels are rarely as good as the originals, and this is yet another case that confirms this. However, the film was still somewhat entertaining to watch, so it wasn't a total loss. The original was a very well-told story that simply creeped you out. It had a dark, foreboding feeling to it, which is exactly what this type of movie should have. Also, it didn't attempt to explain very much, instead leaving much to the viewer's imagination, which is often the most effective way to approach these topics.Final Destination 2 lacks all of the characteristics I just mentioned. The acting is so absolutely horrible, and the dialogue is lame, too. While I enjoyed how the writers tried to tie this movie to the first, the overall story was simply idiotic and flawed, mainly due to explaining more than we need to know. (And what was that crap about ""a new life"" clearing the list? Please!) Most unforgivingly of all, though, this movie lacks that creepy feeling the first one had. Instead, Final Destination 2 is mainly concerned with delivering the strangest and goriest deaths possible. If that is fun enough for you, then this is the movie for you.To sum things up, here are some helpful recommendations: * If you haven't seen the original, go see it first. * If you really, really liked the original, then see the sequel. * If you didn't like or only mildly enjoyed the original, then stay away from the sequel. * If you like gore flicks, see this one.

If you've seen Final Destination, Resident Evil and/or Ghost Ship, then you've seen every possible piece of action in FD2.  EXCEPT - There is an excellent intro scene on the highway that will be unmatched until Matrix Revolutions comes out....AND, there is one particular death scene in an SUV (let me be general for those who have not seen it), that hits the right spot...so to speak.Well, relatively needless to say, there's ample chance for a third ""film"" in the series which will no doubt be so trite that it will make THIS look like a Hitchcock.

The plot was very predicatable and after the first 10 minutes or so I knew who was going to live and who was going to die.  ***SPOILER*** I gave it a 1 instead of a 0 though because I thought it was kinda interesting how all of the deaths were connected to the ones in the first movie.  That was kinda unexpected.   ***END SPOILER***  I didn't think the acting was all that bad.  As usual, Tony Todd gave a wonderful performance, but I didn't enjoy Ali Larter very much.  She seemed very wooden and unlikable. ***SPOILER*** I was actually glad when she died.  ***END SPOILER***  All and all it was a very entertaining movie and when I left the theatre I felt a sense of satistfaction that I had not felt in a long time after seeing a movie.

The first scene plays out very well, but I hated the guy on tv talking about death (only the kids should know, nobody believed them in the first). The car crash is excellent, creepy and atmospheric, and after that it goes downhill. The frequent prominations are annoying (what happened to the signs?) and most deaths are way too stupid and gory (The fence part, The kids death..) and the when Claire opens the door and gets charred, the fx they put in looks horrible! This has none of the original FD goodness (whats with all the prominations? Is she psychotic?). It does tie up some lose ends, but really creates more than that.

This time, it's much more predictable than the original one and much more surreal. Deaths are a lot more gory, bloody and...as I already said it: predictable and surreal.About the characters, there's not as much chemistry between each other as there was at the first movie, they have anything to do among each other, is like you don't feel sorry that one character have just died 'cause it wasn't that important.The movie is good enough (for being a sequel) to entertain you, but it's one of those movies that you can only watch for one time 'cause it loses sense once you saw it.",Final Destination 2

SEE MATRIX:RELOADED for equally sucky crappiness.Having said that, I have three points for those who have watched, and for those about to rent or see it:1- RED SUV in beginning of movie was protected on the left from a concrete highway median divider(you see it many times), enough to at least deflect the car transport trailer.

It skips some much-needed explanation of death and etc. Even had the film added the explanations it still would have felt old. We've seen it all before. Where the original had endearing characters, here we have shallow and unintresting characters.The film is rife with musical cues that foreshadow exactly what will happen. When the horror occurs in the movie it feels just plain silly. It seems the filmmakers didn't take themselves seriously. Basically the film is a cheap attempt to cash in on the original. You would be better off having Death stalk you than watching this film.",Final Destination 2

It has strong Relligious overtones because it tries to make you believe that you have no control over your life and safety; that everything you do is pre-ordained by a higher being who can kill you at will. That belief is actually Religious: ie: Allah controls your destiny and you have nothing to say about it. Belief in a higher being that controls you is RELIGION. Anyway; as ""haw-roar"" movies go, ""The Wizard of Oz"", is much more a horror film than this laughing comedy could ever be.

239,mattshaw,Rube Goldberg Killing Machines,10,14 February 2003,"Any really good Horror movie walks the line between horror and comedy.  The better it does this - the better the movie.  An example would be Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"".  FD2 does this extremely well - between the writing and the editing it creates tension and suspense very effectively. The Horror is graphic and disturbing.The problem when you successfully straddle that horror/comedy line is the possibility of falling off the other side.  For the first 30 minutes the movie is really successful at connecting chains of events that seem almost independently sentient.  A coffee cup becomes a potential accomplice in Death's plan.  After 30 minutes one begins to see humor in mayhem.  By the end of the movie and the not surprising ""denouement"", my wife and I (and the theater)were rolling in the aisles with laughter.  ""Scary Movie"" wanted this response but settled for sight gags and in-jokes.  I did not expect much from this movie, but was very impressed with the unintentional effect.  I will now see the first movie in the series, just to see more work by this team.  It is true that some did not laugh, but most were holding their sides.  It would not be fair to suggest that they rerelease this as a comedy since it is also effective as horror.  I also do not want to belittle the talents of David R. Ellis or the writers of the story and screenplay, J. Mackye Gruber, Eric Bress and also Reddick.  These guys are masters of the genre!

In this movie, despite set pieces just as elaborateas the original (including a scene in a dentist's office that isterminaly creepy), death seems to have lost any reason or rhyme;becoming a killer on the level of a third rate Michael Myers.This time around death stalks the survivors of a horrendousfreeway pileup after a young woman has premonitions that theaccident was going to occur. The people that she saved becomeskeptical, death comes calling...you get the idea.Not that there isn't fun to be had in this movie.

Even if I don't like a film and I say so, I try my hardest to write at least something positive about it.For me even though this film wasn't too bad it really shouldn't have been made. Granted it was pretty obvious that a sequel was going to be made given the cliffhanger ending of the previous movie but I didn't expect this. I thought it would concentrate more on Clear and Alex rather than just bringing in a whole new cast and list of people to kill. Should have known.The cast was not bad but unfortunately they were given very little to do with their characters. Aside from Kimberly and the police officer none of the new additions were developed properly. I couldn't feel sorry for them when they got killed off.Now that I'm done criticizing I can discuss the good parts. Overall this film is still good. It lost some of the creepiness that the first one possessed but regained a bit with the appearance of the mortician. He was great the first time around and was just as good here.Kimberly was also a nice addition. She was done very well having been portrayed wonderfully by A.J. Cook and I enjoyed watching her. I would have felt bad if she died.I can say as well that the way death was working backwards was interesting. Certainly not something that I saw coming.I didn't however approve of them killing Alex and Clear. They were my favorites and needn't have died.Despite that though it's not that bad of a film.

It started off okay, then quickly got into to the main ""substance"" of the movie, which I can fairly accurately describe as ""carnage"". This is definitely a movie for fans of gore. It's not particularly scary, but has a type of ""tale of the crypt"" feel to it. I found it not particularly funny, but still amusing. There was one scene that had me reminiscing about a scene from the movie ""Cube"". It's not for you if you're looking for romantic comedy or something like that. Also not for you if you're expecting elaborate plot twist thriller. Also, there is no ""skin"" in this flick, but they do throw in the customary blonde chick.

247,mbl102,Better than the first!,10,30 July 2006,"We ""finally"" have a yes answer to the age old movie buff question, ""is any sequel better than the original?"" In Final Destination 1 we were introduced to the concept that ""death has a plan."" In the first movie, students on their way to France get off their plane when one of the students has a premonition that the plane is going to explode. Flight 180 does in fact explode and death has to play a little catch-up. The grim reaper methodically and quite creatively tries to finish what he started and send each person to their grave.In this installment of the Final Destination franchise, another premonition is had by a girl on her way to a cottage. This time a pile-up on the freeway which would have killed several more people, is avoided and death once again has to put his regularly scheduled plan into action. One by one he claims his victims and sends them to their eternal sleep. But after a visit to Clear Waters (Larter, yes that is the character's name), the only survivor still alive from the plane crash in the first film, we find out that all these people had been interfered with in their own death by the flight 180 survivors. So death was going to take care of all of them in one fell swoop.This time death is not at all happy and decides to have a lot fun with this elusive bunch of death dodgers. The best part of this movie is the seemingly endless ways that these people almost die. With three people working on ""Characters, Story and Screenplay"" it seems as if the writers sat around and thought of all the coolest ways to have a death scene and then just decided to put all of them in the movie. Everyone is constantly narrowly avoiding their fate until BANG! Their goose gets cooked or crushed or splattered or chopped off. The script itself is one that was definitely not taken lightly. This is a well thought out storyline and holes were looked for. It is cohesive and leads you down a believable path with a completely unbelievable concept. Even the ending is one that surprises without making you roll your eyes.The most surprising thing in this movie is the wonderful cinematography. Normally not the kind of movie that most people would relate to great camera work, but Gary Capo (2nd unit DOP on The Last Samurai, Mission: Impossible II, The Thin Red Line) has a keen eye for camera angles to intensify suspense and surprise. And this movie is full of both.Apart from an over-the-top cameo performance from Tony ""Candyman"" Todd, the actors do a great job presenting a complex and entertaining look at death and uncertainty. It's hard to tell who is going to make it to the end of this thriller, and compelling to see how each person deals with the events in their own way. It's easy to tell that the film makers actually cared about the characters they had created. Like comedies, the genre of horror films has been passed over as fluff in the history of cinema. But as more and more movie fans become film makers, horror films are becoming all around better films. Peter Jackson (Heavenly Creatures, Lord of the Rings) and Wes Craven (Music of the Heart, Red Eye) have proved that director's starting in the horror genre are quite capable of making big blockbusters. Maybe these great films will one day get the respect they deserve.If it's my time to go I want my final destination to be a place that they show films as good as this one.",Final Destination 2

The characters were fleshed out enough so you cared for them, and the death scenes were detailed and interesting. I admit I wasn't at the edge of my seat -- it just isn't comfortable there. Now, I went to the movie theater expecting a dull, boring sequel, and I wasn't surprised. Firstly, the characters were dull, and Kimberly came off as a dull and whiney priss. Burke was an interesting character, but they chose not to explore him. (Spoilerness ahead) There were some good parts to this movie. I *loved* that Clear Rivers (Ali Larter) got more screentime, but I was disappointed at her bitchyness. I suppose being locked up for so long and no one being able to say your name right struck a nerve. (it's pronounced claire, not clear.) But a lot of the deaths were lame. Tim (James N. Kirk)'s scenes were interesting, and the tension was really building up, then he gets smashed by a falling sheet of glass. Big whoop, I'm so scared. Another thing, the way Alex was killed was horrible. The mentally strong, lovable character from the first movie is crushed by a falling brick. How creative. Also, the way Clear was killed really p*ssed me off.    Overall, I give this a 3/10. I truly don't know how ANYONE could find this film decent.

It's not Shakespeare's Comedy of errors because that would be giving this silly series of films way too much credit.Basically, Death sets up a series of ridiculously complex series of traps to kill people. Now, these are traps so insanely complex that the clown from the Saw films would be in awe.Now, don't get me wrong, I normally abhor blood and gore in horror films. But in this movie it's so over the top and unbelievably silly that in all likelihood this film will make you die... laughing. I'm serious man, when somebody is trying desperately to get out of a situation you may find yourself laughing and wondering ""wow, how can this get any more silly?"" And the funny part is that most of the time these people do something that leads to their own demise! You can't blame death for half of the things that happen. These people die because they are complete dumbasses! Anyways, at least it's got Ali Larter, she's pretty easy on the eyes. But the movie is impossible to take seriously. The gore factor is so over-the-top ludicrous that even for shock value it ends up(again) being silly instead of horrifying.My advice? Skip it and watch something that's actually horrifying, like Disaster Movie. How Friedberg and Seltzer still have a career after that movie... now THAT is scary, mofos.",Final Destination 2

259,Straker17,"Somewhat Fun, but Can't Stand Up to the Original",6,10 February 2019,"After the sleeper hit that was the original Final Destination, the studio was obviously anxious to deliver a follow up. However, the original crew involved in the making of the first, could not return. As a result, we have a whole new cast and crew. This was also done with the second Nightmare on Elm Street movie. And while this is not quite as bad of a movie as that one, it does still prove that sometimes the best way to do a sequel is to bring back the original crew.
This new film ups the gore and humor of the original in an attempt to create a movie with more vigor and intensity. However, the end result is a mildly entertaining, but overall empty movie. It fails to deliver the tense atmosphere of the first movie, even if it does sharpen the humor of the first in some moments. These brief one liners delivered by the characters offer most of the entertainment of the movie, which is nit necessarily the best complement to give to what was a serious horror movie.
This time around we have a more colorful group of characters. AJ Cook portrays what turns out to be a very compelling leading character. She manages to add a little more intrigue to the film, and is one of the main reasons the film is worth watching at all. The best character of the movie is probably Kat, who offers a does of effective dark humor to the film. Some of the other characters have a few clever moments. However, some are absolutely irritating. It was a great relief to find out that Kimberly's friends were not in that much of the movie as what screen time they did get, they proved to be insufferable. And the character of Eugene (the black motorcyclist) proved to be highly unlikeable as well.
This films probably has the most convoluted plot of the whole series. The whole idea of new life is vague and baffling, but not in a way that creates intrigue for the future events of the movie. Death also works backwards in this movie for logic that takes a significant amount of thought to understand. And for a movie that is mainly supposed to be a fun romp, it seemed very out of place.
The effects of the movie are a slight improvement on the original's, however the film is still dated by today's standards. It was no doubt a grand feast for horror fans as far as the visuals go back when he first came out, however, today's audiences who were either not alive or too young to remember the film's release won't be invigorated in the same way, nor will they be as compelled to re-watch the film due to a lack of nostalgia.However, the film is not without it's great scenes. Two in particular stand out. It features what is quite possibly the best premonition scene of the whole movie. The car pile up is now iconic in the horror community, even if the rest of the film doesn't measure up. Regardless, it is still a well shot and edited scene. The elevator death is probably the most horrific of the series, remaining both horrifying and tragic as the victim proclaims, ""I don't want to die"" just before death claims them. IN the most effective moment of campy humor, the end scene, involving a teenager barbequing is top notch over the top horror.A few stellar moments, scenes, and characters prevent the film from being unwatchable, and they may even serve as reason enough to watch the movie as some will definitely enjoy the experience, however, they do not save the movie from it's weaknesses. Some audiences, such as the crowds of people and fans who flocked to theaters after viewing the first one, and the most gore thirsty and least demanding horror fanatics will have a great time with the movie, and will be able to put it's flaws to the side. However, it does not escape the more critical eye unscathed.",Final Destination 2

JUST KNOW THAT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU VIEWING IT BECAUSE IT IS ONE OF THE BETTER HORROR MOVIES AROUND*** I still remember seeing this movie opening weekend on a cold night in 2003. It was one of the best movie-going experiences of my life. This is how you properly make a sequel. Final Destination 2 is my favorite movie in the franchise for many reasons: 1.) The Continuity from the first movie. Clear Rivers (played by the brilliant and beautiful Ali Larter)having survived the first movie, checked herself into a mental hospital so she could be safe from Death. One day she gets a visit from a woman named Kimberly who needs her advice since Clear ""beat"" Death in the first movie. Kimberly and the survivors of the pile-up need her help so they can stay alive. The essence of continuity is ever present in this movie and one aspect I appreciated was Clear's matured role. Her character really evolved and matured from a damsel in distress in the first movie to the smart, tough leading lady in this one.2.) The Vision. I still get chills running up my spine thinking about this highway pile-up scene in the beginning. I didn't think they could beat the vision from the first movie but they did. I remember experiencing heart palpitations in the theater because it was so intense.3.) The Characters. Normally in a horror movie, the audience doesn't care about the characters. They just want to see how gory their deaths are going to be. What sets this film apart is that I actually cared about these characters, so when they died, it was more upsetting and emotional. The only thing I didn't like was that they killed off Clear Rivers at the end. But in keeping with the movie's theme, I learned to accept this because it shows that when your time is up, no one can really cheat death.I highly recommend this movie even if you're not a horror fan. The death scenes are very intense/gory and unexpected giving it a massive fear factor. This should serve as a model for great horror movie sequels right next to A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors. Final Destination 2 stayed with me long after I saw it and remains to this day one of my top 10 favorite horror movies.BUT BEWARE: THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART.",Final Destination 2

263,UthinnkUknoMe,One of the best sequels of its genre.,7,26 August 2016,"Most of the time we like to pretend that sequels don't exist, especially in the horror genre, as they generally ruin most of what should have been left untouched from the first film. But every so often the horror genre nails a sequel that brings us everything we liked about the first entry and exemplifies it times two. Final Destination was a great standalone film and truly didn't need the excessive sequels to follow. However, Final Destination 2 delivers and it surely doesn't disappoint. Taking place a few years after the events of the first film, Kimberly and her friends set out on a road trip turned deadly. Having a premonition of a horrific pile up, Kimberly evades death saving the lives of many in what should have been one of the worst pile ups in history. But we all know that you can't cheat death and death always comes back around!Enlisting in Clear Rivers, survivor from the first film, Kimberly tries to save those who were meant to die on the highway that day from death itself. But with death lurking around every corner in the most unsuspecting of places, it's no easy task. The film moves at a solid pace, driving in character emotion as well as a building sense of urgency and suspense. The movie ties up every loose end from the first film, intertwining with the original in a creative, thought provoking manner. Is this film better than the original? In some aspects yes but as a sucker for the original, I would have to say overall no. However, this film is miles better than the sequels to follow and if you have yet to give the Final Destination series a chance- I suggest ending your experience after watching the first two!",Final Destination 2

The ""accidental"" death's circumstances are so outrageous that it will leave you scratching your head. One character dies via an airbag but also has part of her head sliced open (which means zero sense considering the circumstances surrounding her death).FD1's physics were beyond wonky and the sequel (this movie) had be more frustrated than anything else because of all the flat out factually incorrect sequences that were happening.",Final Destination 2

I got a lot more that i expected i thought it had a good plot and creative deaths. The movie takes place a year after the plane crash from the first movie. A young girl Kimberly and her friends go on vacation when she has a vision of a major car crash that involves her friends and everyone behind her in traffic. she stops every one from getting on to the doomed highway and saves there lives. but death comes for them. the only person that got off the plane in the first one that is still alive is in a mental institution. Kimberly visit her and she helps her out along with a police officer when the survivors start getting killed one by one the realize that they were somehow involved with the deaths from the first movie and they attemp to beat death once again,Final Destination 2

However, the part they excelled on was the deaths. WAY better than the first. I couldn't believe that they showed that much considering how PC the movie industry is these days. Granted, these aren't the calibre of gore from the early 1980's Euro-trash zombie and cannibal films, but it is a step above the Scream films and their ilk.

273,ninjawolf77,Awful Conclusion to Final Destination,3,26 November 2003,"A movie that took the teenage splatter flick in new directions is put to rest here by a sequel which returns to the usual improbable setups and warped laws of physics to burn, slice, and squish teenagers in ways you've never seen.  FD1 had immensely imaginative death traps, which could almost always be completely construed as freak accidents.  FD2 stretches credibility in that field - a man who's hand gets caught in a stopped garbage disposal while his apartment burns down around him?  (Has this EVER happened to ANYONE?) Barbed wire that can tear through human bone?  (By the way, that was from Cube.)  And has NO driver in this movie ever heard of using brakes??  By the end, ideas have run short and the movie breaks all the rules it has established to kill off the last character (Eugene).Speaking of breaking rules, what is with the cop's gun which can now evade basic physics, because it isn't part of ""death's design""?  Since it suggests invincibility until ""your number is up"", then why wouldn't you go out and just have an all-out joyride until you became ""next"".Splatter films only work because you can see and relate to the psyche of the characters.  Once the circumstances of the situation become completely irrational, it fails to scare or entertain.",Final Destination 2

""Final Destination 2"" is a horrendous film, and I knew it.The original movie delivered some new material - the plane crash, I mean - and that was fun because no one expected that to be a dream... this sequel, on the other hand, is basically the same movie. It repeats the plane crash scene, but this time the plane turned out to be a truck carring huge logs. It's just no fun. It's boring, I might say.The plot is the SAME. Nothing changes here. The only difference are the death scenes... now they have more blood and look lamer.This movie has a scene an anthological scene - probably the most ridiculous scene ever filmed - that will hunt me thru my dreams: The dentist scene! What the hell was that?",Final Destination 2

277,luridlarry,Best laugh I've had in a loooong time...,1,4 September 2003,"In a movie that goes out of its way to explain Death's reasoning through characters who have rootless epiphanies as the plot necessitates, I find it amazing that nobody questions the convoluted methods Death utilizes in order to go about what, for him, is routine business. Death can, it seems, create these imaginitive and complicated Rube Goldberg chain reactions that result in a demise out of left field, but cannot simply give someone a heart attack, or enlist a goon to shoot them in the face. I must admit, after only catching twenty minutes of the film, I was postulating some very imaginitive manners in which I might slay the filmmakers for the obscene amount of money they no doubt made creating something that would fetch a ""c"" in a Junior High film and video class.The movies message seems to be: People shouldn't die. The writers, if they believe in what they wrote, must actually operate under the asinine notion that the world would be a better place if nobody died.But, I must admit, that rarely have I laughed harder than the scene following the dentists office fiasco. That was gold.",Final Destination 2

When I say Scary, I don't think of tons of blood and flesh flying around. Whole horror part is based on flesh & blood, so it looks like sitting in a butcher shop. At least final destination had some quite good story, this time story isn't so bad, but acting, effects, twists are silly.And beside director's fixation with blood and body parts, things that irritated me the most are sound effects, which are some 30-40 decibels louder than the normal tone, so if you watch movie with some stronger speakers keep remote control close.After this sequel, I'm not so interested in watching the next sequel.",Final Destination 2
280,soonerboy_6,A Good Movie To Watch With Your Girlfriend,8,5 January 2005,"Final Destination 2 was a very cutting edge thriller. I was most impressed with the performances of A.J. Cook and Ali Larter. I saw this one with a few friends at a party and I enjoyed it thoroghly. there was some nice gore in this one,a man getting his eyes gouged out by ladder spokes,a girl getting her head pulled off by an elevator, a man being massacred by barbwire, a boy who got an iron weight dropped on his head, and a girl who is stabbed thru the head with a pipe. (Gives you a different view on airbags!)The humor was more thin in this sequel then in the first, and the language was more pervasive and frequent. It wasn't as much a horror movie as it was a good, suspenseful thriller. The cremation part really creeped my out! All in all, I enjoyed this movie and its a good movie to watch with popcorn and time to kill. Rated R: Strong Violent Accidents/Gore, Language, And Use Of Drugs.",Final Destination 2

282,joshwalt2,simply depressing,1,29 January 2006,"I enjoyed the first final destination, and went to see this one in the theater. The idea was no longer novel, so they had to go with a lot more gore in order to attempt to keep it fresh. It didn't work, and I honestly was saddened that anyone would consider what I was watching to be entertainment. Fr'instance, a boy being crushed to death by a giant glass plate while his mother watched. Yeah. That's just not funny. And with the scene where all the main characters are supposed to die, where a log-carrying semi truck accidentally dumps its load, I'm now pretty paranoid when I drive near any trucks on the highway. Especially if they are carrying logs. Does that make it legitimately scary? I'd say more disturbing than scary.

283,jtwilda,Terrible Movie with Pointless Violence,1,17 May 2006,"There are some movies, such as Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List, in which violence is used appropriately as part of the plot to add to the tone of the movie. Not so for this corny flick. Final Destination 2, even if you call the shoddy writing a ""plot"", has completely gory and unnecessary violence. The best scary movies (such as The Shining) don't rely on dumb disgusting special effects like this one does.You might enjoy this movie if you're sadistic or a fan of cheesy horror movies, but otherwise I would recommend avoiding it. It is downright depressing (and for no reason). The viewer does not get anything out of the movie or its despicable grisly violence.",Final Destination 2

More blood, thicker plot, and no cheap running gimmick.  They explained what happened to the 3 survivors of the first movie (when it went to black leaving everyone wondering).The main fault with the movie was in the editing.  In no less than 4 scenes, the boom microphone is clearly visable. In 2 scenes, it's just poking down into the top of the frame. In one, it came down far enough to ruin what would have been a great scene. In the 4th, the mic was at nose level with the actors. Needless to say, there's probaly a cameraman, mic operator, and editor who'll never work in Hollywood again.It'll be interesting to see if it is removed when it is put to video!",Final Destination 2

289,shilfiell,More gruesome but not as clever,5,1 February 2003,"Mild spoilers will appear throughout!I'm a big fan of the original movie, and took the day off from work to see the premiere of its sequel.  After the first premonition scene and the first real death (which reminded me of Val Lewton's in the first) I was optimistic about this version.  After the promising start, though, things go downhill - the deaths are rushed but become the sole focus of the rest of the movie.  The characters are completely flat.  Plot is negligible.  I never really got a feel for the sequence like I did in the original, and continuity between the two films was lousy.  Granted, the first film botched up the ""switched seats"" order, but that film had a sense to it that I found lacking in the sequel.  Consider:  in the first film, Alex was without a pulse before being revived, yet he didn't end the cycle.  Why would the same circumstance work for Kimberly?  And what was Eugene's tie-in to Val Lewton again?  Did it make any sense at all?  Why did Rory see the hook vision?  OK, and I felt really cheated that Alex from the original was killed by a stupid brick.I enjoyed all the little tricks in the first movie - all the hidden 180's, the altered set and posters in the airport, the clever character names and in-jokes.  The sequel suffers from the departure of the original writing team, I think - they had a lot more fun with their film. The only thing that came close in this one was the magnetic refrigerator letters, but that was a bit too obvious for my tastes.As far as the deaths, I give them a mixed review.  The deaths in the hospital weren't nearly gory enough, the elevator incident looked extremely fake, the slice-and-dice was cool but the body fell wrong. I liked the first, the last, the pile-up, and the second impalement.In the first, I liked the fact that our character didn't die the way it LOOKED like he might - but it seemed like overkill when they used the same type of misdirection later, in the dentist's office and with the leaking gasoline.  There wasn't a single death that made me jump like Terry's in the first, in any case.I enjoyed the movie and it had its redeeming moments.  The ending and Rory's speech to Kimberly after he handed her his keys, plus Tony Todd's disappointingly brief appearance, were all pluses.  Overall, though, I prefer the original.  If you haven't seen the DVD version with the director's commentary, watch it and see how much truly clever stuff you missed.  The first film left me wondering about fate and inevitability: the second film made me wonder, after each death, only ""OK, who's next and how?""",Final Destination 2

It was a great movie, because the cast was a B movie cast, except Ali Larter.  I loved how the director and writers did not stray from the whole ""you can't escape death thing"".

294,onlychannelva,"Not To Good, Not To Bad...",6,1 July 2009,"A year after the events in the previous film, Final Destination 2 picks up with a brand new band of characters. In place of the horrific plane crash premonition, it hits us with something more common in all our lives, an enormous pile up on the highway. Once again a lone girl sees this disaster before it occurs and saves a this time random group of strangers from dying a most hideous death. The characters are a bit more diverse in this sequel but some of them feel dull and unreal more of you can tell that these people are actors. The script is still strong though, keeping those clever death scenes and tricks that I loved from the first film. Duely noted this film contains much more gore then it's predecessor. Making the fancy dress up that the first film had and striping it a bit to seem more like a slasher. Also unlike it's predecessor this one moves quite fast with the story. At some points making it feel rushed and a bit far fetched. Ami Larter returns to play Clear from the first film but with a completely new Sigorny Weaver style (as I like to call it) attitude being an expert on death's little Bobbi traps it sets. It introduces a new idea of how to stop the cycle of death and begins to fill in unanswered questions taking away the mystery of the first film. It did seem at first that this film would follow the same patter as the last and it does but the new ideas keep it refreshing enough to watch. It stick precariously close to the first films script as in character's personality's and clever little puns. But now on to the part that pulls most of it's fans in and thats the gore, I mentioned before there is a lot, and the deaths to accompany them are a bit more far fetched taking the great this could happen to you out from most of the scenes, but I feel all that is made up for in the incredible opening sequence of her premonition. Not a great sequel but certainly not a bad one.6/10",Final Destination 2

Ali Larter & Deborah Unger long lost sisters?,5,1 February 2003,"I found this movie to be not quite as good as the first but what it missed in originality it more than made up for in gore. Splat after human splat - one impalement after another. It was hard to watch at times- due to the graffic nature of the deaths and I'm a horror fan but this film was a bit over the top. If they do make a third film I hope they spend a little more time on developing at least one of the characters so you care if they die or not, actually Michael Landes was pretty good and had to carry the film by himself. Just like the first they wasted a talented Tony Todd - who actually had more lines in this one. One thing I really missed were the cool sound effects from the first one whenever ""Death"" was coming - it sounded like a death rattle. And after watching FD2 I noticed the similarities in appearance between the gorgeous Ali Larter and the stunning Deborah Unger. It's weird how similar in appearance these two hotties are. Someone needs to write sister roles for these two!! Only 10 years difference in age! Anyway, Fatesmagician gives FD2 5 out of 10 and props for brining the gore back to horror films.

I can hardly find words that wouldn't be so harsh to this film, but I can't stop my mind and make it tell lies.In the future I will feel pity for everyone who will waste time on The Final destination 2... well if you get to see it for free you'll probably be left with a laugh or terror of go watching ""the final destination 3"" which should be in the cinema's 2006.",Final Destination 2
304,phantomemail,Yet another plot hole,5,24 February 2006,"Again they mentioned about the order they will die. Well, they didn't die after the highway pile-up in the order they died during the highway pile-up. It was kinda random, actually. What gives? Why make that a major point when it's not observed all the way through? Nos. 2 and 3 are admittedly fun to watch, but they just contain way too many implausibilities and confusion and absence of logic in many cases. Still, better than Fried Green Tomatos....Now, the pick-a-part. Ladder through the eye kept going even though the ladder should have stopped after hitting the asphalt. Plate glass will not liquefy a human but will pound you into a smaller ball. Elevator inner doors prevent outer doors from closing on a person. Steering wheel airbags don't deploy when the force is from the side. Barbed wire, aside from a small barb every foot or so, is larger than 1/8"" and is round and will not cut through a body like razor wire, rather it will just slingshot you painfully (same error in Ghost Ship). The hospital room blowing up was just plain boring, what was so special? And I don't know of many barbecues, whether propane or briquettes or wood, that blow up like that. That's why the first movie was somewhat more believable. The second and third were just excuses to hype the deaths over the story. Regardless, they're still OK.",Final Destination 2
305,Mr. Keys,A Worthy Sequel (...but still a sequel!),8,5 February 2003,"If you liked the first one, you're in for a treat!  FD2 takes you on a bigger, wilder, and, of course, gorier ride than the first one.  I was hesitant at first with a new director and the absence of Devon Sawa, but I am pleased to report that the result is deserving of being a sequel to Final Destination; even though the title here doesn't fit as nicely without a plane crash - but what else would you call it?A good sequel gives you more of what you liked from the first one and new twists to keep you from saying, ""been there, done that"" or, ""I should've stayed home and rented the first one.""  FD2 has wonderful new twists that help it to rise above the typical sequel.  Yes, it's got more twisted fun that made FD such a kick, and it's done in an even more playful fashion. Best of all is how FD2 relates itself to FD.  That is what ""made"" the movie for me.  Where FD2 lacks is in its overall sense of foreboding, which really gave FD its charm.  Still, it is a nice complement to FD and shouldn't be missed for fans of the original.As for those who rip this movie to shreds based on acting/story, etc. This is not Oscar material here.  Who cares?  It's just a sick and twisted good time at the movies.",Final Destination 2

This movie was an insult to the first and also to the whole horror genre. It felt like it was bordering on making fun of itself at many points, which would've saved the film a bit, but it didn't take the extra step to cross into that territory. The dialogue is completely laughable, and when it is good, isn't held in the spotlight as it should be. The spotlight of this movie, instead, is its gruesome gore, which at most times was portrayed in such a way as to almost make you chuckle at its lunacy.The actors who portray these poorly developed characters are faces you will forget as soon as you leave the theater. They are so bland and fit into such generalities that every actor will remind you of a friend or neighbor. The only saving grace is Ali Larter, who should be embarrassed to be a part of this wretched piece of trash. Bottom line; if you've seen the first, you've seen the second with added class and maturity.",Final Destination 2

BE NOT for Final Destination 2. EVERY Death has some sort of gore.(Will try not to Ruin plot etc)Unlike last time you just saw a head come off and that was the worst as far as I can remember. Final Destination 2; MUCH better for the Gore. If anything go see it just to see HOW they die!my Top 3 reasons to see the movie1.

312,macdaddyfu,Gory Story,10,1 February 2003,"I loved the first film, I purchased DVD and VHS copies, and the second one is as good, if not better than the first.  The death scenes were gruesome, the entire theater were covering their eyes or screaming for more.  The storyline of FD2 closely ties in with the first, as if the people in the first one hadn't gotten off that plane, the people in part 2 would already be dead in the first place.  This movie takes place one year after the first, even though it has been almost three years after the original. Things happen in reverse as a way to tie up the ""loose knots"" that the first Final Destination opened up, sort of like an outward ripple in Death's design.  The girls are hot, the kills are scary, and the music fits the film.  I give this a solid 9/10",Final Destination 2

Plenty of gore to go around! Death leaves clues on how he'll get'cha, but if you think you've figured out how the characters will meet their demise, your wrong!
This movie follows the same story-line as the first movie with a plane crash subsituted with a very impressive interstate pile-up.  It stands alone well, so you don't need to watch part-1 to enjoy part-2.Brad",Final Destination 2

317,kyalien,Refreshing blood and gore,9,3 February 2003,"Straight from the bat, let me say that I am a huge fan of Final Destination® - the original movie from 2000 and was really excited about seeing the sequal.The first movie gave us something so simple and yet so original that it was very easy to believe that, well, maybe death could and was stalking us. It's the most simple ideas that make us feel uneasy and what makes a person more uneasy than what is unknown - death.I watched the original just hours before going to see the sequal, just to gear me up for what I was expecting more of. The original is just as fresh as it was just under 3 years ago. I payed close attention to the signs of deaths imminent pounce and was ready for the second installment.So I made my way to the cinema and Grabbed a large CokeT and settled in for what I may call 'The movie event of the year.'.I was not let down!Final destination® made great use of the original plot without being corny although some scenes were (but isn't that what horror flicks are about?). The story, although no longer original, came up with a nice twist to deaths antics and design as he tried to clear up his mess from flight 180 which occurred a year before.The acting for the most part was ok, this is just a horror movie and not a beautiful mind®. WThe special effect were... well.... special! The gore, death scenes and destruction were just refreshing. To much are we cushioned from the real horror of blood splatter and entrails. Some directors think it is much more effective to ""suggest"" the horror rather than show it, but this has become very monotonous and now lacks any impact whatsoever. Kudos to FD for showing us what we have so long desired.The directing looks pretty good and had a nice style. The pace of the movie runs very smoothly and quick, keeping us on the edge of our seats.Camera work is very nice also. Good angles, lighting and mood presence all with a quality sound track.Hope you enjoyed my review, now go enjoy the movie.",Final Destination 2
318,da_wogfather,Diamond in the Rough,7,21 March 2003,"How often do you see a good film wrecked by a absolutely horrible sequel?? Too many to count. Usually the constant recycling of material, the same trademark lines and new characters that seem to replace characters that were brutally murdered in the last movie lead me to believe that it is impossible to up-stage an original. I stand corrected. I went and saw Final Destination 2 last Monday and I was shocked to see that it was just as good as, if not better than Final Destination 1. With a new plan, brand new characters (except Ali Larter) and new and exciting ways to kill people, Final Destination 2 stands as one of the most stable horror/thriller sequels that I have seen in a long time. As a 17 year old, I can be too critical, but I can safely say in this instance ""keep up the great work David R Ellis!!!""The best bit(if you don't want to know what happens, look away now!!!) was when that pigeon chasing kid got absolutely pancaked by the falling glass and someone in the cinema yelled out ""GET THE MOP!!!""",Final Destination 2
319,PrncsT,Could Be Better...,10,10 March 2004,"The sequel to Final Destination came out in the cinemas in the UK in January 03, and with only two of the original cast, Clear and the mortician. The second was not as good as the first and was funnier as opposed to scary, but also contained an awful lot of gore. The idea is that the 'survivors' in the original caused a ripple, in that because they didn't die, it prevented others from dying and now death is after those people. One of those people, Kimberly has a premonition similar to Alex's, but on Route 180 of a pileup one year after the plane crash. That is what gets the ball rolling as Kimberly saves the 'ripple' people from the pileup, but seemingly fails to save them from death. The only survivor left from the plane is Clear, as Alex died between movies. Kimberly enlists Clear's help in cheating death the second time, but by the end, Clear too is dead. Its worth a look, not as good as the first, but it does have its own individual charm.",Final Destination 2

To give a brief summary of the plot, take the first film, remove the aeroplane crash, replace it with a car crash and then kill the cast in the most gruesome, tasteless way possible. The film doesn't generate the slightest hint of suspense or interest and is unbelievably predictable - you know they are going to die, you just dont know in what kind of sick manner. If I manage to stop a single person from going to see this film then I will be happy. I cannot recommend strongly enough to avoid this film.",Final Destination 2

Though some people may find this movie disturbing, I found it to be hilarious. Unlike the first which I found to be more of a suspenseful horror movie, this one was more of a dark comedy. Call me sick, but never before have I seen a 15 year old kid killed by a falling pane of glass; which is unfortunate because it was truly a sight to behold. As far as movies go this one was pretty entertaining, and as far as sequels go it was on par with the first. The pros include: its a decent recycled plot, it has a fast pace, good CGI, with pretty likable characters, and lots of elaborate deaths(if thats your thing). The cons include: a fairly weak ending, with some 2 dimensional acting, and lots of product placement. Every character must have owned or purchased a friggin iMac, with their little colorful apples displayed everywhere... and I hate iMacs.Final Summation 7.5/10",Final Destination 2

To pull that off, the stunt coordinator or whoever had control over that part is great, I hope to see his work elsewhere, he deserves it.Anyway, don't watch it for the directing, acting, script, anything but the deaths, they're pretty entertaining.Car crash 10/10 Movie 3/10",Final Destination 2

I decided to check out the second, thinking it would be just as good, maybe even better. But I was bitterly disappointed. I mean the beginning part plot being a highway pile-up is pretty cool. But the death's just seemed too full of gore. Of course if gore is your thing then you will probably disagree with me but for a non-gore fan it's just my opinion. Anyway, the deaths in number two aren't as realistic...OK so the first ones were imaginative too but the point is, they were a little more believable in the first than in the second.

It is definitely a must-see, even if your not all that into horror flicks. My personal opinion is that the first movie outranks the second, mainly because they over-did the 'splatter-death' scenario from the original.My favorite character in the movie was Alex, not because he was the kick-butt psychic, but because of the way his character was portrayed. No normal human being would be able to stand up to that amount of pressure without having their mentality snap like a twig. I know some people are stronger than others, but my personal belief is that if you could see your death coming, then you would go crazy. The rest of the cast was very believable excluding Clear, who appeared to have a back story too-far-fetched for my personal tastes; father dying when she was ten and then her mother having left her soon afterwards? Not possible. She would have had to have been carted off to some kind of foster home, and we saw her all by her lonesome.",Final Destination 2
329,dduh-50062,Best Final Destination Sequel,8,30 September 2018,"Even though the original was good, I think this movie is better. The fact that the deaths come ""backwards"" is a great idea, because usually in the premonitions, the main characters that you know the best die first. Now that it's backwards, we get to know the rest of the characters even better. It also returns a character. This makes it even better because we feel bad for the characters even worse, like a character who's son had died the same day (he was part of the premonition). I did feel extremely bad for the teacher in the first one, but I felt worse here. Especially for Clear, who was Alex's girlfriend in the first one. It also feels like Halloween 2, like it happened the day after (of course it takes place a year after in this movie) because there were some off screen deaths in the first one, like Terry's death and we finally see the body in this movie. This is a true sequel. You should watch this if you watched the first one.",Final Destination 2

But I had a free pass to a preview screening and a couple hours to kill and I felt like seeing a dumb movie. I had no idea what I was in for. Maybe it was because I saw the first FD on tape, without a jazzed audience, but I would swear that FD2 whips it's dad's butt up and down the dark alley they would invariably meet in. I haven't felt an audience engaged with a flick like that in years. Sure, a lot of people were jeering teen Anakin in Episode 2, and those same people were cheering Yoda when he went off. FD2 elicited a sustained series of groans, laughs, and screams that was a beauty to behold. Without giving anything away, those responses are well earned. FD2 crosses the line over and over, making you cringe and squirm and laugh because you know it's going to happen all over again. Anyone who has seen the trailer will not be surprised to find out that FD2 has one of the most over-the-top car crash sequences ever filmed. Having personally been in accidents numbering in the double-digits, I can say that this film made me more scared of automobiles than all of those accidents combined. ""Final Destination 2"" may just be another stupid movie with a lot of blood and guts, but it seems to know that and it just wants to have a good time. It sees the potential in the great idea in the original and plays it out the way it should be played.

It is a brilliantly created screen play that shows us all how weak and fragile we really are . All these ways to get hurt (all un-natural too)How we take life and the whole world for granted.? It shows HOW THINGS CAN STACK UP.Watch closely how the blind, stand and stare as multiple stupid things happen and no own takes the proper action. ( I would have run ) It is typical in my experience. The gas station scene was classic. Stupid man on ladder next to cars. smoking around gas, and 5 or more dumb things happen all at once. There should have been more carnage at this moment, but God was forgiving the innocent, that day. (mostly) Are we really innocent when we walk through life not really looking? All this technology and sometimes it can stack up on you.The kid , mouth open , no oxygen , now mouth is full of silly ceiling ornament. Unattendance is illegal i believe in real life.I see cops beside the road with guns out , fingers in the trigger guard and I speed up , , others slow down. I distance my self from the sheep. Curiosity is more important then life.The movie is brilliant , it reflects exactly how regular people behave.It taught me to be more watching of other making mistakes, or myself!Maybe the movie had 2 target audiences , teens and persons like me. reality: One day at cattlemen city Gas station in CAL. I-5, is saw a middle 35 yr? old Mexican pouring gasoline down a carburetor, air cleaner off , yelling , OK start it now (to other Mexican) , I ran I yelled Sir. please stop and he called me an Spanish cuss word (translates to male prostitute) ,then BOOM , huge fire ball . The man died even though I tried very hard to save him.Things happen like this all the time, what if children were near or a gas truck fill the main tanks.

The original was filled with surprises and edge of the seat tension. I have never been in the cinema and have every one watching react so intently as the original. Until I saw the sequel. We all knew what to expect, but when it came it was still shocking. But this time there was the added gore factor. I like to pride myself as not being squeamish, but I was shocked by the graphic scenes of death in this film. The opening car crash is amazing. So shocking and realistic it makes you think you are in the middle of the carnage. The film makers should be congratulated for some scenes that should shock you beyond belief but are twisted to make you laugh instead of throw up. Even if you haven't seen the first one, you must go and see this.

343,naturalmenace,worse than the first.. hard to believe,1,19 March 2009,this movie is so stupid... of course that many people are gonna die when they come up on a log at 10 miles per hour and suddenly flip 15 times then explode in mid air... the motorcycle chased the guy who happened to impact a log.. the log didn't kill him.. but his bike did.. DUHHH!!! Does anyone realize that the number of explosions in your movie doesn't dictate how well its rated? you should try being a little realistic once in a while.. cars don't explode when they flip over... and usually when something like a log through a cars windshield usually causes the cars behind them to stop.. i'm sure i would stop if i saw a log fly through someones car. you people suck and your acting skills leave A lot to be desired.,Final Destination 2

WOW, FD2 had none of that, all of the people were totally real characters. I was frightened beyond believe, in the first accident scene i sat in the theater, face completely frozen in terror, like i was there watching the horror take place, the kid in the car banging the truck and semi together was teasing me, i almost lost it.

346,Tevla,The most unnecessary movie of the year!,1,31 January 2003,"This movie features gruesome beheadings, dismemberment, and fiery deaths.   That is it.  There are few surprises, you just wonder how fast the characters will be killed off.  Unfortunately, it's not soon enough.The crack one-liners, the glorification of both drug use and violence, and an obligatory piece of nudity will pander perfectly to the teenage market.  The cast is one of the worst assembled in any wide release film in recent memory.  Sure, the death special effects are top of the line, but who cares?  This movie epitomizes what is wrong with some of today's teens, they just don't understand death and its implications.",Final Destination 2

Without missing any of the traditional elements of a good ole' slasher film (gore,suspence,nudity and humor) Final destination 2 takes it to a new level within the first 15 minutes.   I do not want to ruin the movie if you haven't seen yet, but I will tell you this. In the beginning of the movie there is a heart-racing scene so gruesome and chaotic,that even a ""Jolt Cola"" would seem like a pretty good night cap.  This movie is not to be taken seriously, so if you're looking to have fun with a date or just some friends then this is a film for you.",Final Destination 2

The death scenes in this movie are some of the best I've ever seen... period. Not only are they bloody, but they are realistic. I won't go into detail on the plot because you can get that anywhere, but the story also works very well. It kept me guessing throughout the whole movie as to how death works. And the final scene is hilarious!",Final Destination 2

We both thought that it was great fun and entertainment.  Officer Burke in my opinion is a cutie.  He does a great job.  The only thing that was a little boring and drawn out was the apartment scene before the mom got killed.  A little drawn out, but other than that, the movie was great.

I had to laugh always when I saw them. The story is exactly the same as before, but the way the people die is really funny again. So 3/10 for the story which ends very bad in my view, the first theorie was much better. But 11/10 for the really cool death scenes. That makes a 7/10 for my voting.",Final Destination 2

Ok, well back to the topic....I finally got my mom to take me to see Final Destination 2 yesterday, and I just have to say that I think it is probably the best sequel that I have ever seen. I am sad that Devon isn't back, but I am glad that they at least told us what happened to him.

355,beau_30,Good Plots,10,15 March 2003,"This Movie was brilliant. The most of all things that I thought was brilliant about this movie was that you never saw death coming unless you were paying attention to it in every single detail. I for one have watched the first one several times. And The second was better than the first.
Ali Larter- Played a good part in this movie. She explained to us a lot of the information on death and its design.Tony Todd- Did a great job with also explaining death, But also kind of creepy. Of course he is the Candy Man. If they do make a part 3, Tony Todd should be the main lead.A.J. Cook- Did a great Job on a first real major role on a Movie. The Lead was great she played it well. I like how she managed to feel for her character and other characters as if she was really Kimberly.A lot of the information did make somewhat sense. I find this movie over all 9 out of 10. There are some great features, cool death scenes, and things you wouldn't imagine possibly.I advise you not to watch this movie if you do not like blood.I for one would pay money to see this movie over and over again. ""Death take no victims, and it doesn't exclude children""",Final Destination 2

It had more creative death scenes then the first, better people, and better effects. The begginning( car crash scene ) was very well played out and the rest of the movie just got better and better. There were a couple of really gross parts and some deaths were actually sad, but it was just plain fun. If you really like horrer then PLEASE see this movie. I give it a 9 out of 10.",Final Destination 2
357,freddy_that_got_fingered,"Great [Major, major, major spoilers. Don't read if you haven't seen the movie.]",10,25 July 2003,"I though this film was great. Nowhere NEAR the first one, but still pretty good. The film begins with Kimberly Corman going on a trip with her friends, Dano, Frankie, and Shaina. Among the people on the highway are Kat, a business woman, Rory, a coke-addict, Evan, a lotto winner, Thomas Burke,a cop, Eugene, a substitute teacher, and Nora and Tim, a mother and son. Well, the various characters are driving down the highway when a logging truck in front of them accidentally drops its logs off the back of it. The first log crashes through the front window of the cop car, coming out the back with guts and blood all over it. Eugene's motorcycle spins out, flipping him off. He slides until he hits a log, but his motorcycle slides into him, splattering him. Suddenly, Rory's car flips out of control, flipping and turning until finally landing straight, only to be hit by an oncoming semi. Kat's SUV suddenly hits a log, flipping over and crushing her inside. Inside Nora and Tim's car, Tim's water bottles fall behind the break pedal, denying Nora the chance to break, eventually crashing them into a log. Suddenly, Evan's car spins out of control, slamming into a truck, exploding. Kim's SUV flips out of control and lands on it's side. She sees Evan burning alive in his car until the logging truck crashes through it, blowing it up completely. Then the truck crashes into Kimberly. Suddenly, Kimberly wakes up and sees all the signs of the crash. She parks her SUV across the on-ramp, keeping everyone off as the crash happens before their eyes. Suddenly, a semi crashes into Kim's SUV, killing all her friends. She survives because Burke pulls her out of the way. Afterwards, Evan is fixing himself dinner after throwing some spaghetti out the window, but his apartment starts on fire. He eventually gets out and falls off the escape ladder. He slips on the spaghetti and the ladder leg falls, stopping about 8 inches from his eye. He thinks he's safe, but then the ladder falls all the way, impaling him through the eye. Later, Tim is coming out of the dentist's office, but he goes and disturbs the pidgeons, which distract a construction worker, who drops a huge sheet of plate glass down which lands on Tim, squashing him to oblivion. Later, Nora gets her head caught in the elevator. As it goes up, her head gets chopped off. Later, Kat crashes her SUV, which sends a pole through her headrest. During this scene, Rory saves a farmer boy from getting hit by a news van. When the firemen are trying to get Kat out, they jam the jaws of life into the car, which deploys the airbag, impaling her head on the pole. She drops her cigarette, which ignites a trail of gas leading up to a news van, which explodes, propelling a barbed wire fence at Rory, which slices him into 3 parts which slide off each other. Later, Eugene's hospital room explodes when some oxygen leaks out and a plug sparks, killing him and Clear. At the end, the farmer boy dies when his barbecue explodes.In my opinion, this movie was pretty damn good.",Final Destination 2

359,x-nightcrawler,"A great sequel of campy, gory and great fun.",10,30 May 2003,"Now, this is a sequel to 2000's surprise hit, and one of my favorite movies, `Final Destination'. I want to add how much I was expecting this movie (since Final Destination) and now I am happy to report that the movie was not a letdown and the three year wait was very much worth it.I will start off by mentioning what I did NOT like about this sizzle sequel, I know I shouldn't compare this with the prequel, but that way, you'll get better the idea. One of the many things I adored about the first movie was it's freaky and very scary atmosphere but where is it!? Not here! The movie is mostly shot in daytime, and that lowered a lot the sense of creepiness. One more thing I couldn't stand is that they turned this movie into another pop corn horror movie. It has way too many jokes I didn't appreciate all that much (the last frame comes to mind) and that mucho lowered the tension, which was another of the many things I adored about the prequel. The script had some flaws right there, maybe it is just me but maybe it didn't explain fully the idea of death's design, I didn't fully get it, but then again, maybe it was just me. The characters are much less developed as in the original, as being a bunch of strangers, you couldn't care less for most of them...they are all stereotyped and I was only waiting for most of them to die...(I kinda loved Nora actually) and add to that some extremely disposable side-characters (BBQ kid...lmao). As for the acting, I must say it's mostly convincing; if it's not the at times tacky dialogue pulling some characters down, it's mostly fine. I really didn't like Eugene I don't know what p***ed me off, if it washis characters or just HIM...I was waiting for the Angel of Death to do his thang on him.And guess what mistake the sequel did? The same as in Final Destination.a scene where some of the characters visiting the same creepy mortician (Tony Todd) we saw before, again, his character is not explored in any level, the scene again slowens the pace big time and is much more useless than in the original.Now, for the upside, this is by far the ballsiest R rated movie I have ever seen. I was extremely uncomfortable and was yelling like a maniac in the movie theater. I am not talking only about ball gripping tension, but the goriest, most 'out there' kill sequences I have ever seen. Remember how strong the run over kill was in the original Final Destination? That's nothing ok? Hear me out here. The kills are just amazingly strong and mind bending.awesome s***e. I also mucho enjoyed the fact of 'death' being again only a sadistic presence that we feel all around us. For some reason I felt it much more time than in the first one, there are thousands of accidents here. I also appreciated how they didn't just made 'another' Final Destination story, they also added a clear link between the events involving Flight 180 and this car pile up. Another great thing is that they also added some really cool new effect in death's design for this one, I will not give it away, but I really liked how it's not the same thing as Final Destination, the cool omens are still there, especially in the opening car pileup, which is definitely the harshest bit IMO. The Ellis man definitely knows his s***e, he has a great imagination and has BALLS, he also pulls tons of great enlarged shots, overhead shots, fluid camera movements, tension and silence. He has style!Final Destination 2 is a sequel that succeeds and fails in some levels. I will grade it a `8.5/10' for it's great entertainment and freak out value; Maybe it's not better than the original, but definitely doesn't embarrass it.",Final Destination 2
360,enchanter,really funny,10,15 June 2003,"I've just seen the movie today and I found it to be really funny and relaxing.Call me sick, but every time a person died I laughed at the way it was executed and the looks on the people's faces (the ladder guy and the kid in the end). Of course they are major plot holes and silly happenings (when the guy got chopped by the fence the firemen in the background didn't even notice)...But the movie is very enjoyable and I recommend it to anyone who likes funny gory movies.",Final Destination 2
361,Devilguy555,"This Accident Is Most Realistic Yet,Best Movie I've Ever Seen",10,5 July 2003,"This move is all about the real-life accidents and mishaps that could happen anywhere, anytime, to anybody. You think you're safe? Think again. This movie delivers with strong kills, a cast of unknowns(which is good, because you don't have to see pretty-boy Tom Cruise with a log through his face, which is good, because the rest of the cast doesn't have to to to compare to some big actor),and a plot that is just as scary. It starts with a group of people, 4 friends on a trip to Daytona Beach, a business woman, a biker, a druggie, a mother and son, and a cop. The driver of the truck holding the 4 friends, Kimberly Coreman,then sees ""signs"" along the road that hint of disaster, then disaster strikes. This has to be the most horrific/realistic car accident I've ever seen in my entire life. Like waking up, Kimberly then sees and hears all the signs that point out that an accident is in the works. She parks at the end of the on-ramp of the highway, and keeps everyone on it from being in the accident that follows soon thereafter. Sadly, her friends die tragically and brutally. What follows is a story about the survivors trying to save the life of an unborn child, and the lives of themselves. This flick just goes to show that accidents happen all the time, and at anytime in the day or night. You don't need creepy settings and ominous music to bring out the horror in this movie, because it's already there. Scary as hell kills and lots of fun is included. Definetly a must for the big horror fans. Have fun",Final Destination 2
362,jamesay36,Some of the deaths weren't as good as they could've been,7,23 November 2011,"For example, the dude who was impaled in the eye (Can't remember names, sorry) could have lived in the top apartment and could have fell all the way from the roof after tripping on something (a brick, maybe) and landed on the edge of a dumpster, whacking off his head. Alex from part 1 could have (more like SHOULD have) died with Clear in some overly-complicated, sudden, and gory accident that these movies are known for. The movie was still very good. The pileup scene was amazing. It brings out your own mortality through a point of veiw of someone cheating death, and having to pay the price. In other words, you can't cheat death, no matter how hard you try. If I missed anything, comment below and tell the world.",Final Destination 2

364,acg706,"Not as good as the first one, but gorier *minor spoilers*",6,17 December 2005,"I saw this movie expecting to see another cleverly done psycho thriller, and I have to admit, it did pretty well. The death scenes were thrilling to watch, and they were very gory. But the acting was mediocre and the there wasn't much characterization, which makes it hard to mourn when you watch them meet their crimson ends.The disaster at the opening is awesome and memorable, much more intense than the plane crash in the first. Also, the one with the premonition is a girl, Kimberley Corman, who is already dealing with the death of her mother. Kim blocks the highway, also stopping several other people. They argue and think she's just a loon, until they see the pileup that death scheduled them to be in happen before their eyes.At first, they don't think twice that this wasn't their only encounter with the reaper. But soon one survivor was killed in a grisly accident involving a ladder(you can see the movie to find out what happened) when the second survivor meets his maker, she turns to Clear Rivers, the sole survivor from the first movie, for help.Even Clear's knowledge of death's design doesn't keep some more from dying, so they must figure out how to thwart death's rage, leaving blood and guts in it's wake. Towards the end of the movie, the whole series manages to take a turning point, and they make some surprising discoveries, including how Alex and the others getting off the plane unknowingly saved the pileup survivors.Overall, I'd have to say that despite having much more gory and intricate death scenes, this flick couldn't manage to live up to the original, perhaps that was because James Wong didn't direct it, but you'll be glad to know that Wong will be directing the third part of the series:).",Final Destination 2
365,dagmardude-1,final destination 2,10,5 March 2005,"this movie was okay, but its just like the first final destination when there is a giant plane crash and then there is a giant highway crash and where death kills the survivors of these horrific incident in gruesome, unpleasant ways i mean like in the first where billy is just standed beside the train track where u see this piece of metal laying under the train and very fast it shoots out and decapitates him and where the lady in the elevator chokes very badly when an elevator door closes on her head and eventually cuts her head off. i mean this is very similar to its first, although it is a very thought out sequel to the writers and directors whom made it. bottom line: deaths a bitch",Final Destination 2

Don't know if this is really a spoiler, but I thought car crash scene at the start was really amazing. I ranked it really high for what it was - it's not trying to be A Beautiful Mind, it's trying to be a great popcorn movie. Back when I was trying to be an actor this was the kind of movie I fantasized about being in - what could be more of a blast. I don't find movies scary generally so I can't say that I thought it was scary, but it was fun. I could watch that car crash over and over - how cool it would have been editing that. I always detested slasher horror movies - tedious and lame. As a horror movie I thought this was much more enjoyable. My Best, BDK",Final Destination 2

Therefore he dies and comes back to life - the new life the film insists is necessary for cheating death - but gets a brick to the head anyway. (The writer's revenge perhaps?) What remains is a plot hole the size of Texas - clearly they expected him to return and wrote the script accordingly. When he didn't they switched in the character Clear for Alex as the survivor of the first film and gave the rest of his part to Michael Landes. I've nothing against Landes but how exactly does that work?The deaths are inventively gory (especially ""Don't throw your pasta out the window"" guy) if not always possible, but the plot is a nonsense.Take my advice: Skip 2 and go straight for 3. It will spoil nothing and make a lot more sense.

Granted the deaths are a little extreme and sick. However, you can't have everyone passing away quietly otherwise it wouldn't be a good horror. Highly recommended.The first film had amazing effects. The accident in this one is 30 times better. The only problem i had with this film was that Alex is not in it. You do however find out what happens to him.

This is more bloody than the first, but also has a more complex story. Unlike the other two Final Destination films and most horror films, it doesn't just revolve around a group of high school friends but takes people from all ages at random from society and puts them into this terrifying situation. The acting, direction and so on are of a high standard for a horror film, particularly a sequel. Don't begin this movie expecting anything but a 90 minutes of blood, gore and shocks which is strangely enjoyable.

Don't expect to be scared by the film, be expected to be scared by anyone who finds watching a graphic depiction of a teenager ""squshed"" by falling glass funny. The big clue here is that this film is not a comedy, there are no deliberate jokes, it's actually trying to come across as a credible horror movie.

Are you serious :S After watching it for an hour and somewhat minutes they find the ultimate solution to get death of their back and be happy forever. Even I could have thought up a better story. The cast wasn't very good either, a lot of inexperienced actors who just didn't know how to act in a situation like this, it looked like a really low budget film (don't know if it actually is :P) I hope they did better in FD3, and did not just made a clone of the other parts (only worse :P) and linked it to Final Destination 1 a bit.",Final Destination 2
