0,MartinHafer,"Well, if you like a lot of action and fighting, then you're in for a treat",7,17 May 2008,"In this sequel to THE LION THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE, the four children begin the story one year later back in Britain. However, they are summoned back to Narnia and they are shocked at what awaits them. Centuries have passed and most of the mythical creatures seem to have vanished--replaced by greedy humans bent on their destruction. So it's up to the kids as the returned kings and queens of Narnia to make things right.Visually, this is a truly amazing movie. While the last film in this series was a sight to see, this next installment is even better--with amazing CG creatures and a battle that is quite thrilling. However, once you look beyond the amazing special effects, what you are left with is only rather ordinary--mostly due to rather one-dimensional characterizations. Instead of real people or mythical characters, most of what you see in the film seems to lack any sort of back story or depth--they are just there. Some won't mind this and will simply sit back and enjoy the eye candy (and it is impressive--you certainly can't deny that). People like myself who love characters and story will be a bit less impressed. Additionally, while the general tone of the C.S. Lewis story is intact, there have been a few changes--such as a rather difficult to believe romance (it seems to come out of no where).Despite all my negative comments above, do NOT take this to mean I disliked the movie. It's just that is clearly could have been better plus I really wish there had been more story to it than just one battle after another with slow-motion clips abounding during the fighting. For teens, this is probably a good film and worth seeing with their friends--they'll most likely love all the action and cute characters (though there are far less here than in the more child-oriented predecessor). Plus parents don't need to worry about them seeing it--the message is good and there is inexplicably almost no blood in the film. For the more adult audience, they may just want to wait until this one comes out on DVD.By the way, although there is no indication how long the kids were gone from Narnia between the two films (and they refer to it as ""many centuries""), at the very end Susan says it's been 1300 years. Where this number came from is anyone's guess and there is no explanation for where she suddenly gets this number. I think there is a dangling plot element Disney forgot to take care of and it left me confused.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Visually beautiful, but unengaging story-wise",6,31 December 2010,"As a little girl, I adored the Chronicles of Narnia books, and I still do. I also liked the BBC adaptations, done in mini-series format, they weren't amazing, but they were enjoyable and stuck to the books' spirit. As far as these film versions go, I haven't yet seen Voyage of the Dawn Treader, but I enjoyed Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe. Prince Caspian was not a bad film, but it could have been better.Visually, the film is very well done. I loved the cinematography, while the scenery and costumes are gorgeous. The effects are also good, and Aslan still looks brilliant. The music is beautiful too, with lovely melodies. The end credits song was nice, but I think it should have stayed as an end credits song, it didn't seem right placing it in the final scene to me. The direction is decent too, while the battle sequences are riveting, and the film did begin well.As far as the acting goes, it wasn't bad but it wasn't amazing either. The best are Eddie Izzard who is spot on, Peter Dinklage who comes close to stealing the film with his eyes alone and Liam Neeson who lends his majestic voice to Aslan, and while her appearance is very brief Tilda Swinton is quite chilling. The four leads are good enough, and in Georgie Henley's case improved. Edmund also has potential. I had mixed feelings on Miraz though, more to how he was written than how he was acted. Sergio Castellitto does make an effort to make Miraz dark and charismatic for the villain of the piece, but the way Miraz is written and developed makes him come across as insipid. The weak link is Ben Barnes. He is handsome and has his moments, but he is rather bland on the whole.My real problems with Prince Caspian are in the storytelling and pace mainly. The story has a tendency to become too unengaging, the more involving scenes are well done but the slower scenes are close to ponderous. The pace is rather lethargic this time round, while I don't think the film really needed to be as long as it was and the characters come across as shallow. Also particularly with Caspian and Miraz, some of the dialogue is stilted.All in all, Prince Caspian is not a bad film, but it lacked something. I also forgot to say as an adaptation of the book it is not great, granted the book was not my favourite of the series but I felt sometimes there was a bit too much padding that could have been excised slightly. A disappointment, but on its own terms and for the visuals and music it is worth a look. 6/10 Bethany Cox",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
2,bkoganbing,The Pevensies Return To Narnia,9,20 May 2008,"This second film based on C.S. Lewis's The Chronicles of Narnia finds our wartime Pevensie siblings summoned back to their magic kingdom because all is not as they left it. Some humans called Telmarines have taken over and have slain a lot of the talking creatures that inhabit the place. It's up to Peter, Edmond, Susan, and Lucy to set it right.As I liked the first one, I enjoyed C.S. Lewis's fantasy world as depicted on the big screen. The special effects are first rate and the acting both human and animated is flawless.In addition to the usual sources in Scripture, C.S. Lewis threw a couple of plot lines from some very familiar English stories like Hamlet and Ivanhoe. Of course the climatic battle between the Narnians and the Telmarines has an ending straight from The Ten Commandments.The kids playing the Pevensies are getting older, but retaining somewhat their youthful appearance. It was three years since the The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe and another film, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader is projected for release in 2010. I hope they all don't age too dramatically in the interim. The one playing Edmond really had a growth spurt in three years.Prince Caspian is great entertainment, bring the kiddies, bring the wife, or bring yourself, to use that old cliché; it's for children of all ages.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
3,Leofwine_draca,A Prince among similar family films,8,17 January 2011,"An engaging follow-up to THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE, PRINCE CASPIAN contains everything you could want in a summer blockbuster. There are huge battle sequences, some great CGI special effects, engaging characters and an overload of imagination that promises spectacle, intrigue and danger, all at the same time. Despite my often harsh comments about the films I watch, I'm actually easy going when it comes to film-watching and I don't ask for much from my movies. PRINCE CASPIAN ticked all the boxes for me.The story, based on the C. S. Lewis novel, is straightforward enough: the Pevensie siblings are called back to Narnia and find themselves in a world vastly different from the one they previously knew. Centuries have passed, all of their friends are dead, and a new civilisation brings imminent danger to those living in the world. The Pevensies must ally themselves with Prince Caspian, an ousted heir and help him reclaim the throne. Along the way they interact with all manner of fabulous creatures, engage in splendid set-piece battles and witness the return of the kingly lion, Aslan, as well as an old foe.It's not a film where the actors give excellent performances or where you expect a ton of originality. Instead, it's a movie where every cent of the huge budget is put up on screen to feature in lengthy set-pieces: the climatic sequences involving the river god are eye-popping and the huge battles, despite owing plenty to RETURN OF THE KING (as always) never disappoint.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
4,SnoopyStyle,Lots of battles Lacking in magic,6,27 February 2014,"The four Pevensie brothers and sisters are drawn back to Narnia one day in the subway. They find nothing left of Cair Paravel but only ruins. It has been a long time since they had last been there. The Telmarines has since taken over. Aslan is gone but Lucy (Georgie Henley) sees him every once in awhile. Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes) is the rightful heir to the Telmarines. His evil uncle Lord Miraz (Sergio Castellito) wants to kill Caspian to claim the throne. In desperation, he escapes and calls the Pevensies to lead the Narnians to take on his evil uncle.There are a lot of expositions and explanations. It's too long at two and a half hours running time with overly long battles. The one on one fight is especially too long. It lacks the poetry or the magic of the first movie. It just never gets the same feel. The White Witch makes a small cameo. Aslan is desperately missed for most of the movie.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
5,claudio_carvalho,Things Never Happen the Same Way Twice,6,8 August 2009,"When Queen Prunaprismia (Alicia Borrachero) delivers a baby boy, King Miraz (Sergio Castellitto) orders his soldiers to kill Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes); however his tutor gives Susan's magic horn to him telling that he should blow is his life is in danger and asks him to ride to the forest. However he is chased by the Telmarian soldiers and he summons the Pevensie siblings. They discover that hundred of years have passed in Narnia and they join Prince Caspian to lead the people of Narnia against the evil King Miraz. When the battle begins, the siblings send Lucy to seek out Aslan, otherwise they will not win the powerful Telmarian army.I expected to like ""The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian"" more than I did. The special effects are top-notch, but the story has a poor development of characters and the unoriginal final battle gives a sensation of déjà vu to the viewer with the excessive use of CGI. But the greatest problem is the weak lead cast: the four siblings and Prince Caspian are performed by the wooden and unknown young actors and actresses that are too weak for the lead roles. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""As Crônicas de Nárnia – Príncipe Caspian"" (""The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian"")",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
6,kosmasp,"and the ""saga"" continues ...",6,7 September 2011,"While I haven't read the Narnia books, I have seen the movies. And the second one is holding it's own against the first one. The story continues and you get new characters thrown into the whole thing. One of them being the Prince as the title suggest. And the British actor portraying him does a pretty decent job with his Spanish accent (though in the end it is redundant, see movie 3).Actors from part 1 return and you get a few character faults with that. Overcome this and so forth. Nothing an adult won't be able to see coming. But the kids probably will have their fun with it. A few battle scenes thrown in and you get a decent movie",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
7,classicsoncall,"""Everything you know is about to change"".",8,7 November 2010,"I've read Tolkien but not C.S. Lewis. Watching this 'Prince Caspian' installment of the Chronicles series as a stand alone story is satisfying enough, but I couldn't help feeling that it was a bit of a re-tread of 'The Return of the King'. You have your band of adventurers (seven/eight for the Hobbit group versus four/five, Pevensies plus Caspian); your spiritual leader (Gandalf/Aslan); your evil tyrant (Sauron/Miraz); the epic quest (The One Ring/The Tenth King); the come alive river (Horses/Giant); and your epic final battle featuring mythic creatures of all types. There's even walking trees here, a lot like the Ents, which caused me to groan from the unlikely coincidence of that even being suggested.I'm sure Chronicles fans won't be fazed by any of this, and I'll probably have to read the books to make more sense of it. Chronologically, Tolkien wrote his books between 1937 and 1949, while Lewis came along about a decade later. So if Lewis was influenced by Tolkien, I wouldn't be surprised. But setting LOTR aside, 'Prince Caspian' was even a bit derivative of the first in the Chronicles series, 'The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe'. I enjoyed that film a lot better in the way it introduced the characters and the way it created a sense of awe and wonder with the White Witch, the Spirit of Christmas and the talking animal characters. There was more of a sense of whimsy to go with the danger and just felt fresher and more original as a story. So even though I look forward to the sequel Narnia movies, it's not with the same anticipation that I have for the LOTR pre-quel - 'The Hobbit', if it ever gets made.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
8,jboothmillard,The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian,4,15 November 2010,"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was a good magical adventure, and I saw the trailer for the sequel and didn't think it was going to be as good, so I saw it to make sure, from director Andrew Adamson (Shrek). Basically it has been a year since the Pevensie children, Lucy (Georgie Henley), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), Peter (William Moseley) and Susan (Anna Popplewell), were in Narnia, which in the magical world is actually hundreds of years. They used to rule the land, and since they left Narnia has been taken over by the nasty King Miraz (Sergio Castellitto), who wants to kill the real heir to the throne, his nephew, Prince Caspian (National Movie Award nominated Ben Barnes). The children are back in Narnia to bring peace back to the land with new friends, Trumpkin (The Station Agent's Peter Dinklage), swashbuckling mouse Reepicheep (Eddie Izzard), Trufflehunter the badge (Ken Stott) and many other forest creatures like centaurs, minotaurs and giants. They all form the Narnian army that will go against the Telmarines, Lucy goes into the forest to try and find Aslan (Liam Neeson) who she believes is still alive and will help peace be resumed. In the end, after a water God in the river sweeps away the bad guys, King Miraz is defeated and Aslan does indeed bring peace back to the land, the children say they will not be coming back as they return home. Also starring Warwick Davis as Nikabrik, Tilda Swinton as Jadis the White Witch and David Walliams as Bulgy Bear. There is a part of the film where Aslan says ""Things never happen the same way twice"", which ironic because that is pretty much the whole film. It just felt pretty much like they were repeating the first film again, all right there were some good special effects and amusing moments, but I just found some of it a little boring, not a great sequel but I suppose it's not bad family fantasy adventure. It was nominated the National Movie Award for Best Family Film. Okay!",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

In this impressive production , C.S. Lewis' imagination is brought to life with top-drawer computer generator special effects . Although C.S. Lewis wrote ""Prince Caspian"" second, it is actually the fourth book of ""The Chronicles of Narnia . This agreeable story is lavishly produced by Andrew Adamson from ¨Shrek trilogy¨ and Mark Johnson , along with C.S.

Rousing musical score fitting perfectly to the action-adventure by Harry Gregson-Williams . The motion picture was marvelously directed by Andrew Adamson , he's the director,producer, writer of ¨Shrek¨ trilogy . Adamson found a way to have the film stand on its own by adding a grand scale castle battle to the storyline, to make this film more epic and action oriented ; he made this second trip to Narnia bigger and more overblown than the first. Although this film was quite successful , it was far from the blockbuster success of the first film , as a result , Disney declined co-production on the rest of the series . Rating : Above average and worthwhile seeing , the whole family will enjoy this film . It's a very likable adventure-fantasy and enormously appealing for kids, adolescents and young men . Overall this is a really nice movie . If you are familiar with the story, then there are no real surprises, but makes up for it with overwhelming CGI animation.

10,CinemaSerf,Great cast in/out of vision keep this engaging and fun.,7,31 March 2020,"One year after their return from ""Narnia"" the four Pevensie children are summoned back. They arrive to discover everything has been destroyed and the land divided - humankind and animals no longer co-exist - under the autocratic rule of the nasty king ""Miraz"" (Sergio Castelitto) who murdered the previous king and usurped the throne from the rightful successor Prince ""Caspian"" (Ben Barnes). A great support cast including Peter Dinklage, Warwick Davis and Pierfranceso Favino help the kids and the Prince do battle - alongside a rather deferential but feisty vocal contribution from Eddie Izzard as ""Reepicheep"", the chivalric mouse - to restore the proper order. It's not got as much going for it as the first film in the series; the story isn't quite so engaging - but again the dialogue, scenery and score all contribute to a thorough enjoyable family fantasy adventure that relies much more on the quality of the story than on extensive use of CGI.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
11,dbborroughs,Vast improvement over the first film this film has too much religious symbolism to completely work,7,26 May 2008,"When his Uncle tries to kill him Prince Caspian flees in the woods. Pursued by his uncle's men he blows a magic horn bringing the four kings and queens of Narnia to aid him. Its 1300 years after the events of the first film and the world of men has intruded into Narnia driving its inhabitants into the forest where they try to survive and not revert to being just wild animals. The children from the first film (for whom only a year has passed)now have to find a way to save the world they love .Sequel to The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe this is a a vast improvement over that film. Decidedly more adult, this film has a good number of intense battle scenes where no one is assured of coming out of it alive. people die, often and often quite painfully. (The film gets bonus points compared to Indy 4 where you never fear for anyone's life). There is a real weight to the proceedings and it keeps you watching and wondering if it all will be okay.The effects are much better than in the first film and the film only falters technically when we some see some funky facial hair on some of the Narnians.If there is anything to quibble about its with two things. First its that there are a couple of times when the film slows to a crawl because of too much exposition, or rather the wrong sort of exposition, namely too much philosophical discussion, while it adds weight to the story it also slows things down. The second problem is that the Christian allegory is in full force in this film almost to the point of distraction.You'd have to be almost oblivious not to notice it. Enough Arslan as Christ already. Yes I understand that the source novels were written as allegory but at the same time I didn't know they were allegory until almost two decades after I first read them. The books were fantasy first and allegory second. Here its out in the open and at least for me, its too much and I was distracted from the central story. Its the difference for me from wanting to see the film again or not (I enjoyed it but I'm less likely to see it again because I don't need to be preached at.) Besides the best allegories are the ones that don't appear to be about what they are about at first glance.If you can get past the religion this is 7.5 or 8 out of 10. If you can't 7ish out of 10. Either way worth at least one viewing preferably on a large screen since the film is open quite spectacular.(And you really need to see the first film)",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
12,Boba_Fett1138,"The Chronicles of Narnia more matured, just like its characters.",8,25 January 2009,"In my opinion ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" was more a movie that got aimed toward young movie goers, lets say about the age of 12. This latest Chronicles of Narnia entry got obviously aimed toward a slightly older audience. It's a bit more serious and less cuddly all, which makes this movie even a better one to watch than its predecessor.Not that I was the biggest fan of the first movie but I saw the potential the franchise had and despite its obvious flaws I gave the movie the benefit of the doubt and gave it an high rating, simply because the movie did not failed at it to bring some quality entertainment. Like many sequels of lately, the movie-makers actually seem to spend time to look at how to improve sequels and learn from their mistakes from the first movie. This movie is really less flawed than its predecessor. For instance the story flows better (probably because of the fact that we already know the main characters from the first movie, so no introductions are required) and the movie handles its characters better as well. It helps that there are slightly less characters this time and it definitely also helps as well that the characters are not as sweet and cuddly as well. It's a more matured movie, just like all of its characters.It's also a better looking movie. I was never too impressed by the special effects from ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" but I must say that in this movie they did a considerable better job with it. It definitely helped that they gave the special effects department a bigger budget this time. This is also partly what got the franchise in trouble though. Despite being received well at the box offices, it didn't provided Disney a profit. The Chronicles of Narnia gets now continued with the help from a different studio, that still needs to be found but I'm sure that will succeed at this. It's an interesting and potentially a very profitable franchise for any studio basically.What perhaps also gives the movie a better look is Karl Walter Lindenlaub camera-work, who already also had a lot of experience with multi-million dollar budget movies, having worked Roland Emmerich in the past, on his more earlier movies.It's not like the story of this movie is much better though but perhaps this is also what makes the movie better to watch. There are no distracting side-plots and the movie is pretty much straightforward. It becomes obvious from the first minute on what needs to happen and the movie builds up to that main point, without ever really diverting. It makes the story easy, as well as pleasant to follow. The movie simply brings some fine and good looking entertainment.Just like in the first movie, it are mostly the battle sequences that impress. It's surprisingly large scaled all for such a family-friendly movie. The movie also isn't afraid to fully show its battles and everything that comes with it. So we seeing people dying and falling and all things like that, as you could expect from a movie featuring epic battle sequences.Of course there is also a slightly Christian undertone again but in this case it doesn't work out as distracting and obvious as it did in the first movie. I was a bit afraid they would give Aslan (who basically is God) too much screen time and I also had heard stories like that in advance. However as it turned out, his screen time is actually quite limited and his 'wise' words and philosophies are therefore also not as annoying and distracting from the movie as I had feared.The movie obviously spend most of its budget on its visual aspects, so no big acting names are involved with this movie this time. Yes, Aslan is still voiced by Liam Neeson but as earlier mentioned his role is relatively small. Tilda Swinton also makes a very small cameo as the the White Witch. The role she played in the previous movie. It's about an 10 seconds reprise really.If you liked the first movie, you'll like this movie probably just as much and perhaps even better!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
13,neil-476,Chronicle no 2 - a hit!,8,26 June 2008,"It has been quite a few years now since I read the book. Consequently I no longer have the specifics in my head, only an impression. I do recall that it is probably my least favourite of all the Narnia books, being noticeably darker and more sombre in tone than the others.It's fair to say that the film captures this tone (especially in one lengthy night battle), although I suspect that there are areas where it deviates considerably from the sequence of events recounted in the book. However, I'm getting to the point where I don't mind a movie adaptation diverging from its source material in some respects as long as it captures the essence of the original, and I think Prince Caspian does this.The only on-screen holdovers from the first film are the young actors playing the Pevensie children, all of whom are noticeably better this time around, and Liam Neeson's superb voice work as Aslan.Running nearly two and a half hours - there's a fair amount of story to slot in - the film never drags. The effects are, as one expects by now, excellent, and the big delight this time is actually a small delight - the bloodthirsty mouse Reepicheep, making his debut here prior to a much bigger role in Voyage of the Dawn Treader, the next Chronicle. Eddie Izzard plays him straight - the right choice.If I had one criticism it would be that there are a number of verbal anachronisms - contemporary figures of speech which simply were not in use in the 1940s. However, most of them generated laughs, so it would be churlish to object too strongly.I think The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe has the edge over Prince Caspian, but not by a very big margin.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
14,evanston_dad,"""Prince Caspian"" Lands with a Slight Thud",7,19 May 2008,"This disappointing follow up to ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" had the unfortunate disadvantage of being based on a book that just doesn't tell as good a story as its predecessor, but even with that it could have been a better movie.I liked the intensity Andrew Adamson brought to the previous Narnia story, and I thought it nicely matched the tone of the book. Though ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" series was written for children, they were dark and adult in their themes; they were about kids who were being forced to deal with adult complexities before they themselves were of an adult age. However, in this second installment, Adamson ratchets up the intensity a bit too much. The result is a movie that thunders and pounds along when it should be bewitching us with its fantasy. There's a feeling of sameness to the whole movie -- with the exception of a couple of excellently executed moments (the appearance of Reepicheep, for example, or the initial infiltration of King Miraz's castle), there are few images I remember.I don't remember the book ""Prince Caspian"" that well, so I'm not sure how closely the film adheres to it. I know it gets the basics right. But I don't remember the book spending quite so much time with the evil Telmarines and their political intrigues. I think the back story of Prince Caspian is told as one long flashback, with the rest of the narrative sticking closely to the four Pevensie children and the Narnians. Here, Adamson moves back and forth between the stories, I guess under the impression that this approach works better cinematically; but because of this, the film never takes focus. Is this the continuing story of Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy? Is this movie about Prince Caspian? Is this movie about the Narnians? Edmund is practically nonexistent; the actor who portrays Peter isn't likable enough to root for; again, it falls to little Georgie Henley as Lucy to carry the film, and she does so ably.""Prince Caspian"" is well put together, no doubt. Adamson knows how to make an action film. But the story loses some of its magic and its steam in this installment. Let's hope that the next two films (if they get made), which are based on two of the strongest installments in the series, get both that magic and that steam back.Grade: B",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
15,ferguson-6,A Step Back,6,18 May 2008,"Greetings again from the darkness. Not at the level of the first film in this series, but still entertaining. Director Andrew Adamson is back at the helm as are all the ""kids"" (Kings and Queens of Narnia). Interesting to note that Adamson is turning over the directorial reins to Michael Apted for the next chapter (2010 release date).C.S. Lewis was very upfront in stating that he wrote the Chronicles as a biblical allegory to interest kids. While the youngest kids will struggle a bit with the story line, most will find the characters and visuals fascinating ... even if they never make the religious connections.The exception is Prince Caspian played by Ben Barnes. This Prince has a bit too much San Francisco (not that there's anything wrong with it), replete with puffy shirt and Shampoo commercial hair. I kept hoping the evil uncle would figure out a way to off him! Despite that, Eddie Izzard and Liam Neesom turn in strong vocal performances again, and the action sequences are amazingly cool. Not exactly a classic, but certainly worth seeing.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

He also helmed the Shrek films as well. The four principal actors playing the children return and not only do they assist Caspian in his battle but they will become royalty themselves. William Moseley and Anna Popplewell return as well as Peter Dinkledge as a dwarf whom they rescue from certain death in the film's beginning. Ben Barnes as Prince Caspian is heroic and capable of being King but by film's end he is given a glimpse of romance. Georgie Henley and Skandar Keynes also reprise their roles as Edmund and Lucy who are more of a focal point here than the older children. The Biblical references feature Aslan as a Christ-like figure that are prominent throughout the series. It also contains a theme regarding power and destination.

17,zetes,"No Lord of the Rings, but probably a tad better than the first Chronicle of Narnia",7,1 June 2008,"I went into this with low expectations, and they were exceeded. I liked it quite a bit, perhaps more than the first film in this series, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. I think it's because the religious allegory is much more subtle. I also liked the plot line of royal intrigue and power struggles, which is always a favorite subject of mine. The first time around, I said that the film's main success was the casting of four kids who could act, and that statement holds up perfectly here. Georgie Henley, Skandar Keynes, William Moseley and Anna Popplewell are all great as the Pevensie children, and each of them has their moments to shine. Ben Barnes is the newcomer, Prince Caspian, and is not nearly as successful. He's a pretty but dull boy. Sergio Castellitto makes a good villain, though, and Peter Dinklage and Warwick Davis are good as Narnian dwarfs. There are at least two set-pieces that beat anything from the first film, the night raid on Castellitto's castle and Caspian's attempt to summon the Ice Witch (Tilda Swinton, in a brief cameo). The story ends kind of weakly, with an almost literal deus ex machina. And the fact that Caspian's subjects are overjoyed at his return, despite the fact that their families have been decimated by him in the previous day's battle, bothered me. The next installment of the novels, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, was my favorite of the seven, so I hope they continue to improve.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
18,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Prince Caspian,9,19 May 2008,"Taking place just a year after they left Narnia (which in Narnia time is about 1300 years since they've left), the Pevensie siblings - Peter (William Moseley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Keynes) and Lucy (Georgie Henley) get summoned back to Narnia and realize that things have drastically change since the last time they remembered it. The animals seemed edgier and have more angst, and their new guide for Narnia, the dwarf Trumpkin (Peter Dinklage) replaces the James McAvoy's fawn, filling in some quick history lessons for our quartet who return to Narnia in an age almost similar to the first time they set foot there. Summoning them is Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes), who's a ruler-in-waiting having to flee from his land because of an assassination plot, and teams up with summoned Kings and Queens to retake his homeland as well as to bring peace toward all.Noble thoughts indeed, but not without its problems of course. A land cannot have too many kings (as we learn from Lord of the Rings), and while Edward knows of his place in the hierarchy of things, Peter the Magnificent surely felt Prince Caspian a threat, and both do not hit off really well, especially when their strategies of war appear to be in conflict. Nonetheless through their trials in the story, they will learn and realize lessons in humility, especially when they know they are subject to similar temptations of short cuts to absolute power and victory they crave. While this is more of a Peter story than an Edward one (Who had his fair share in the previous installment), William MOseley's performance as Peter do allow you to both hate and cheer for him as the story develops, while Skandar Keynes taking a backseat meant that he gets all the coolest moves as an action fighter.Ben Barnes came across as a speaker with a Spanish accent, quite arrogant in the first place, at least until his benefactors arrive, whom he got acquainted with only through folk tales he learnt from his teacher. Although the titular character, it does seem that Caspian himself plays a supporting role to the quartet, given that we're more interested in their return and the change that they'll bring. However, if the Narnia movies were to proceed with another, then expect Barnes to play a larger role then. Anna Popplewell's Susan continues her role as the female archer, and doesn't really add much to the mythos, except perhaps for the fleeting romance and affection she develops for the good looking Caspian, while Georgie Henley's Lucy is a little bit grown up now, but still retaining that bit of innocence in her as the sole believer and seeker of Azlan, bearing all of Narnia's hopes on her lithe shoulders.The special effects also took a great leap forward, improving upon the lacklustre hack job done in the earlier movie, and the talking animals, for once, I thought they didn't irritate (yes, talking animals get on my nerves, after so many movies exploiting this cheap trick to infuse into their plots). Shrek lovers will undoubtedly fall in love with a new character in the movie styled as a mouseketeer, erm, musketeer, and if I were a shrewd toy businessman, I'd stock up on this particular plush toy (seems like rats these days get lots of love!). To top it all off, there are some nicely put cameos which links back to the first movie, and having their share in some intense sequences, no less.There are a lot of good things about Prince Caspian, and I'm happy to report that it builds on the original which served as a foundation on which better things are built upon, and thankfully, this sequel focused on its strengths instead of getting bogged by its weaknesses, and provided all round entertainment with what I would deem as a guilty pleasure. Highly recommended, especially to detractors of the first movie, this one is set to put the franchise on an even keel!",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
19,siderite,Better than I would have thought,8,16 November 2008,"I kind of expected a lot of better special effects and some silly story. But it wasn't so. The effects were actually kept to a minimum, while the story was made darker and deeper.I actually would have liked it a lot if it weren't for the trees saving the day at the battle of something eerily similar to Helm's Deep and the waters coming to take away the bad riders trying to cross the river... But that may have been the book's fault. Alo, I didn't understand why Aslan and the Narnians only appear to have some backbone when humans are around, otherwise keeping content to being invaded, oppressed and brought close to extinction. It was probably some deeper meaning that is only clear in the book, as well.Bottom line: a lot more acting, more depth, less of that feeling in the first film when you didn't understand why everybody did things in a hurry to get to the next scene of the book and some humour. The dwarfs and the mice were cool :) Less of a fairy tale, though. It's not really something for little children.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
20,JamesHitchcock,Obeys the general law that sequels are rarely as good as their originals.,7,14 July 2008,"In ""Prince Caspian"" the four Pevensie siblings mysteriously find themselves back in Narnia, the country they once ruled as Kings and Queens. Although only a single Earth-year has passed, by some strange trick of time some 1,300 Narnian years have gone by, and the country has changed. And not for the better. Under the Pevensie Dynasty the four monarchs were the only humans in the land; the subjects over whom they ruled were either talking animals or various creatures, such as centaurs, fauns and dwarfs, borrowed by C.S. Lewis from Graeco-Roman or Norse mythology. During their absence, however, Narnia has been invaded by a human race known as Telmarines; the original Narnians have been forced back into the forests and the Telmarines prefer to believe that they have become extinct.Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy find themselves in the middle of a political situation straight out of ""Hamlet"". The Telmarine King Caspian IX has been murdered by his brother Miraz, who is plotting to usurp the throne from the rightful heir, his nephew Caspian X. Caspian, however, has discovered that the Old Narnians still exist, and has taken refuge among them in the forest, where they have pledged their loyalty to his cause. It is Caspian who has summoned the Pevensies by blowing a magic horn.Lewis himself said of his book that its theme is ""the restoration of the true religion after a corruption"". Fortunately, the film-makers pay little attention to this aspect of the story, concentrating on its more cinematic themes of courage and chivalry. There is less overtly religious content in ""Prince Caspian"" than there was in ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"", essentially an extended allegory of the Fall of Man and the Passion and Resurrection of Christ, although one thread running throughout is the importance of having faith in Aslan (i.e. Jesus) rather than relying on one's own efforts or upon the forces of evil.Ever since ""Lord of the Rings"", fantasy stories- ""Eragon"", ""The Golden Compass"" and the various ""Harry Potters""- have been flavour of the decade in the cinema. ""Prince Caspian"", however, is perhaps the film which most shows the influence of Peter Jackson's magnificent trilogy. It is a long time since I read Lewis's novel, but I can recall enough of the plot to realise that the film departs from it in a number of respects. Jackson was much praised for the power of his battle scenes (such as the battle of Helm's Deep in ""The Two Towers"") and Andrew Adamson seemingly wants to match these, because the film contains battle sequences, particularly the unsuccessful Narnian attack on the Telmarine stronghold, which have no equivalent in the novel.In the book Caspian was a teenager, around the same age as the older Pevensie children. In the film he is several years older, played by an actor in his mid-twenties. The film-makers also conjure up a romance between Caspian and Susan (I doubt if Lewis would have approved) and set up a rivalry between Caspian and Peter, both of whom see themselves as the real leader of the Narnian cause and neither of whom really trusts the other.Lewis did not identify the Telmarines with any particular human culture, but here they are given a distinctly Mediterranean feel, with all the main Telmarine characters (except Caspian) played by Spanish or Italian actors. Their costumes and military uniforms are based on those of the sixteenth century Spanish conquistadors (although unlike Europeans of that period they have no firearms, in line with the convention that fantasy films can be ""sword-and-sorcery"", but never ""gun-and-sorcery""). As the Telmarines are a generally villainous lot, those Spaniards who felt their country was unfairly treated in ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" might not enjoy this film either.Although I was never a great admirer of Lewis's books, and am certainly not an adherent of his brand of evangelical fundamentalism, I greatly enjoyed the film of ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"", which seemed a magical and highly imaginative piece of storytelling. ""Prince Caspian"" has its good points, but was never quite as enjoyable. I think the main reason was that ""The Lion."" was centred upon the struggle between the two main adversaries representing good and evil, the regal Aslan and Tilda Swinton's icily seductive Jadis the White Witch. Lewis's leonine Christ-figure, however, features less in ""Prince Caspian"", and Jadis only makes a very brief appearance, which means that the story focuses more on the human characters, none of whom are as interesting. For all his matinée idol looks, Ben Barnes makes a singularly wooden hero, and William Moseley's Peter seems to have been carved out of the same tree, which means that the rivalry between Caspian and Peter never holds our interest. Georgie Henley is enchanting as Lucy, but Skandar Keynes, who made an impressive Edmund in ""The Lion."" is given less to do here.On the positive side, the computer-generated talking animals are very impressive, and I liked the way the film-makers and Eddie Izzard realised one of Lewis's best characters, the valiant, chivalrous warrior-mouse Reepicheep, whose personality seems to come straight from ""The Three Musketeers"". (Reepicheep is still referred to as a mouse in the film, even though in size he more resembles a very large rat). The battle scenes are well done, although they cannot match the power of Jackson's. Overall, however, ""Prince Caspian"" obeys the general law of film-making that says that sequels are rarely as good as their originals.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
21,Smells_Like_Cheese,Chronicles is a winner!,10,17 May 2008,"The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian, big blockbuster number three in the summer of 2008, now I expected this to be an exciting movie already, but I have to tell you that the excitement got so much higher as I watched this movie. I couldn't believe just how awesome this movie was, I mean the first Chronicles is a fantastic movie, but this movie takes a few steps ahead. It's definitely more mature, it takes on a lot of battle scenes, like a Lord of the Rings type of battle with a ton of creatures who are fighting for their land back. We have amazing effects, with taking badgers, goats, and mice, and the mice, this is no Puss in Boots from Shrek 2, this is the blood thirsty mice that kick butt! The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian is seriously one of the best films I have seen this year.The movie begins where the first Chronicles left off, the kids are in England, pretty depressed and miss Narnia, it's been a year, but while in a train station, they are taken away back to Narnia where it's been 1300 years. The land is in bad shape, they have been called by Prince Caspian, the kids are these legends to the Narnians, but they need the kid's help. So everyone is in for a strong battle to get Narnia back into the beautiful land it once was. Lucy is hoping to re-connect with Aslan, but everyone does not believe as strong as she does.The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian is a movie that will not disappoint, I cannot believe how good this movie was, I was so excited watching all these amazing battle sequences. The plot is actually pretty easy to follow, for kids that are under 10, I'm not so sure if this is a film for them, I know that The Chronicles of Narnia is a family film, but there is quite a bit of violence in the movie, like blood, cutting, decapitations. But for the effects, I would say this is safer than Lord of the Rings. Like I said before though, The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian is truly a winner, this is just a fantastic movie and is a must see.10/10",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
22,Robert_duder,Suffered from sequelitis...but still worth seeing,8,3 June 2008,"Yes I made that word up and yet you know exactly what I mean by it. It happens to nearly every film that goes beyond 2 or three sequels. Even Lord of The Rings stumbled into this during the second installment. The original Chronicles of Narnia was brilliant and breath taking and they established this new fantasy world and all these characters but it seems as though the film makers felt like because all of that was already established they could just jump right into the fray and while that might be true to a certain degree it made the film feel a little rushed and crammed together and it clocks in far shorter than the original. It felt like they didn't spend enough time establishing the new characters they introduced the way they did in the original. Fans of the original will miss all the terrific characters like Beaver and his wife, and Mr. Tumnus and while they try to create new characters for us to love they don't spend any time endearing them to us and that's unfortunate. So without sounding like I'm trashing the movie I'll move on...The World of Narnia is still beautiful and the battle scenes in Prince Caspian are easily superior. The film is definitely a little darker but without being ridiculously dark. The last 45 minutes (the big battle that the film builds up to) is just awesome. Also a brief scene where Caspian almost inadvertently releases The Snow Queen was also incredible.The original four children return to the story. Georgie Henley is still adorable and easily one of the best characters in the film. Skandar Keynes, who I was not a fan of from the original, I didn't like his character and I thought he was far weaker than the other three children, was terrific in this sequel. He was far more heroic and just a much better character. William Moseley who I thought was one of the best performers from the original film takes a bit of a back seat in this one, perhaps leading up to Voyage of the Dawn Treader where is absent from it. They really didn't let him take a front role although his battle to the death with King Miraz is awesome. Anna Popplewell returns as well as Susan and she was always one of my favorite characters as well but she definitely took a bit of a back seat to it as well except to play a small love interest to Prince Caspian. She still has her bow though. Newcomer Ben Barnes is being paraded everywhere having beat out thousands for the role of Prince Caspian. He is good in the role, looks the part and very heroic and makes the girls squeal for joy. I thought his actual performance was a little flat at times but he'll do well in the role. Didn't really understand why it sounded like Prince Caspian had some sort of Puerto Rican/Latino accent either but that's not a big deal. The very talented Peter Dinklage plays Trumpkin, the dwarf who discovers the children have returned. He is the best of the new characters and at least gets to establish his character a little more. Sergio Castellitto is the newest villain as King Miraz. He is good in the role but doesn't even hold a flame to Tilda Swinton's Snow Queen.People who adore the original film as I did, must see Prince Caspian. It feels almost like an old TV reunion that they put together just have the original cast come back. Instead the film should have been an entirely new adventure and it doesn't always feel that way BUT it is a must see and hold it to it's own merits because the battle scenes are just amazing and the CGI is brilliantly subtle just like the first one was. I have never read The Chronicles of Narnia books so I can't judge it accordingly to that either. Regardless it is worth seeing and you won't be disappointed but it also won't come near the level of the sure to be classic original. I still hope it does well and we see these adventures continue. 8.5/10",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
23,Lejink,Two princes,8,13 May 2013,"Not as cute as Harry Potter or as deep as ""Lord Of The Rings"", the expensive dramatisation of C S Lewis' Narnia"" books has foundered commercially and arguably critically too. For me though I've found them an enjoyable and entertaining viewing experience, with this second episode, if anything, superior to the first.Perhaps the central characters of the four rather posh Pevensey children and the war-time setting is a little too far distant from today's very different world to connect with the kids of today, but to those like me who've read the books and also grew up on Enid Blyton's Famous Five and Secret Seven adventures, this movie is a pleasant throwback to childhood and old-fashioned family entertainment.It doesn't help however that the kids this time escape to Narnia via a time-dimension transportation at a train station, too reminiscent of Harry P's way to Hogworts, but after that it settles to a rattling good tale, with lots of exciting moments and a big finish with the expected good triumphing over evil happy-ending.The child actors handling the main roles, this time supplemented by the teenage title character, again perform enthusiastically and energetically, although its fair to say the girls exhibit more charisma than the boys. Perhaps also there are too many cuddly talking animals which tends to infantilise proceedings while the centaurs have the depth and believability of a hologram. The human baddie this time s the treacherous Miraz but somehow he fails to exude dread or evil so that you're not surprised when he's later beaten in one-to-one combat with Richard at a key juncture.There are however compensations in other eye-catching SFX, I especially liked the leafy- spirit which showed Lucy the way, the resurrection of the Snow Queen and especially the rage of the water-spirit at the end. Overall, I really enjoyed this second adventure in Narnia and am sorry that after another relatively unsuccessful sequel under a different studio, it still failed to find a mass audience and left our young heroes rather stranded in limbo as things stand.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

Difference is this story is awful, boring, and no interesting characters. I didn't think the first Narnia movie was that great, but it was better than this one. The only one I liked was the lion, Aslan, and he isn't in this movie till the very end.This movie is just like one long battle scene. And because it's a Disney film, there's no blood and not really any good fighting. The kids in the movie do kill some of their enemies; however, the camera pulls away and doesn't show much. I mean how many scenes with sword fighting can one movie have? The actor who played Prince Caspian was pretty good looking; however, his character kind of sucked. He just wasn't that interesting. And the girl who played Susan looked like she's already had collagen injected into her lips.

25,g-bodyl,Better than the First!,10,4 December 2008,"I really loved Prine Caspian. While the Lion, Witch, and Wardrobe focused on telling the story of Narnia and appealing to kids, Prince Caspian is very much different. The tone of the movie is much darker. There is more action and more drama. There is even a hint of romance set in the story. In round two of the Narnia tales, the Pevensie siblings are back in Narnia because a troubled prince used the famed horn to call them. Along with Caspian and the Narnian folks, the Pevensie siblings must defeat the tyrant Lord Miraz. There is one question on everyone's mind. Where is Aslan? This movie is so much better than the first film and I gave that film 10/10. The acting is better and the action has gotten better. The evil Miraz really brings something to the movie. I liked the music by Harry-Gregson Williams. Overall, this a great movie with a darker tone. I rate this movie 12/10 if I could.

26,CuriosityKilledShawn,I've never been more bored in my life,1,27 June 2008,"I haven't read the books, so I'm not prejudiced in any way. But as someone who actually enjoyed the first one I was startled by how shockingly dull this snoozefest sequel is.I can sit here and spend an hour writing a review that tears the film apart bit by bit though, quite frankly, I have better things to do with my time so I will only focus on my biggest complaints.Yes, I know it's a film for kids and that it's rated PG but where is the blood? Hundreds of people, humans and creatures alike, are felled in battle but there is not one drop of blood in the whole movie. What is this teaching our children about violence exactly? Don't give me any nonsense about traumatizing them either. I saw Predator when I was a kid and I turned out fine. But this is Disney after all and the only people keeping them afloat as a studio are overprotective mothers who fear absolutely everything and are only too happy to spend money on movies and products that falsely suggest that the world is a magical and safe place (this is what you call being 'Disneyfied') and consider something as tame and boring as Prince Caspian to be dark and tough. ""You may find Narnia a more savage place than you remember,"" warns Aslan. Wow, does that mean that we'll be getting Rambo-level violence? Sadly, no. However, more people are killed in this film. Can you work that out? Because I can't.Since I haven't read the book I wasn't previously orientated as to who's who and what their motivations are, and the film doesn't make it any clearer I promise you. Far, far too often I found myself asking 'Who is he?', 'Who are they?', 'Why are all the bad guys identical to each other?', 'Why are they the bad guys again?'. 'What do they want?'. 'Why are they all Spanish?', 'Why are the kids still kids? Shouldn't they return to Narnia as adults?' And so on...and so on...The only thing this film is good for is a cure for insomnia. I know that's a childish and crass and far from being a clever soundbite but it was so catatonic that it simply is not inspiring an intelligent review out of me.Whatever charm the first film had is well and truly gone, all that's left is some pretty scenery and that's not enough to keep me interested for well over two hours. Please Disney, don't even bother making the rest of them.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
27,tabuno,An Old Movie for Our Times,8,20 January 2019,"19 May 2008. Overlooking that 1,300 years doesn't seem to include much modernization in Naria, there apparent has been a lot of change to which was used to good effect. The substantive, contemporary, hard-edged adolescent issues are dwelt on even better in this sequel. Even when it seemed that this sequel would disappoint by dumbing down the characters and plot, the movie, the script inevitably redeems itself with difficult and oftentimes human emotions and decisions that have serious consequences, reality that is too much missing in juvenile movies of our age. The human characters seems all too often very real with their own faults. The animal and non-human characters are seamlessly interwoven into this movie without coming off too cheap or ridiculous. Even the squirrel, while bordering on an animated caricature, manages to possess a more mature and respectable demeanor while providing the comic relief. With a few technical flaws as with Prince Caspian managing to avoid any apparent physical damage after a bruising accident and a mysterious light glow from likely impossible sources in an underground cave, this full feature fantasy world is superior in ways that Potter can't avoid - the humans are real without magic and must handle themselves in ways that all children must without spells or witchcraft. While there is fantasy, it is the human emotions and intelligence and morality that are the premiere aspect of nobility in this movie.

28,The-Sarkologist,"This is actually a very good film, not strictly faithful to the book but very faithful to the themes",9,9 February 2012,"It seems that Hollywood is starting to move away from the central themes of the Narnia Chronicles, and this is only the second movie. However, I was delighted when I discovered that they had turned the second (and third) novels into movies because I am an avid Narnia fan (in fact C.S. Lewis is pretty much one of my favourite authors/philosophers). It is a bit of a shame that Dawntredder did not make as much money as it could have, however it appears that there are two more movies in the pipeline.I will not go into details of the differences, however notice that unlike Lewis' novel, there is a little more going on on Earth. Susan is now being courted by boys, and Peter has suddenly developed a superiority complex. It is interesting that the eldest of the Pervenese kids is the one pining for Narnia. This is not surprising though, because in Narnia he is the High King Peter, while on Earth, he is just Peter Pervenese. This is probably a danger for this magical and imaginative worlds, and I think it is good that Adamson did explore it, because even though we, in this world, do not escape it in the same way that the Pervenese did, we can still get ourselves caught up in our own fantasy realities.In the book, most of the story is told as a narrative, namely the Dwarf, and later Prince Caspian. However, Adamson has added a few scenes in which I believe are very helpful. The first is where the Pervenese decide to launch a surprise attack upon the Telmarine Castle, and despite a beautiful plan, everything goes wrong when Caspian ends up being driven by emotion as opposed to common sense. It could have worked, but it did not, and I think that it is more than the middle of the movie where plans are hatched, and failed, but it is rather the idea of having a much higher, and bolder, opinion of oneself, than is safe to do so.The second one is where Caspian, and later Peter, is tempted to resurrect the White Queen as a solution to one's problems. It appears that Aslan has not returned, and they have just suffered a humiliating defeat, and Caspian is offered a way of escaping from his predicament, but calling the White Queen back to Narnia. Even Peter, who believes (incorrectly) that he killed the White Queen, is enthralled by the power that they could have if they bring her back. However it is Edmund who makes the decision, and destroys the image. He has grown a lot since the last film, and while Peter is trapped in his illusionary reality, Edmund, who has already bitten by the White Queen, is well aware of the danger that it entails, and acts on it.I believe Adamson, and Disney, have done a really good job with this film, and in fact it was a lot better that I expected. There is actually still quite a lot of Christian allegory's in this film, and this is keeping faithful with the original stories. In fact, I feel that the scenes that were added by Adamson to the film work to enhance these allegories, as opposed to blunting them, as Fox did in Voyage of the Dawntredder.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

30,didi-5,"worthy sequel, but not really CS Lewis!",7,20 July 2008,"Let's get the quibbles out of the way first. This film, the second in the series of 'Chronicles of Narnia' (but actually an adaptation of the fourth book in the series, as they are now numbered), is supposed to be based on CS Lewis' book 'Prince Caspian'. However, it adds characters and plots, and changes some key points - in the book, for example, Caspian is a child - here, he is a surly adult. The Telmarines in the book were not dark, swarthy, and didn't speak with foreign accents - that was more the province of the Calmorenes in the 3rd and 7th books.However, this aside, the four Pevensies (Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy) find themselves pulled off the platform of Strand Underground Station (the closed Aldwych) into a world they find vaguely familiar - it transpires they have arrived after an absence of over 1,000 years. Narnia is in chaos, ruled by the usurper Miraz and bullied into submission so that the trees and talking animals have all but disappeared. This is the context in which the four Kings and Queens find themselves battling again for the good of their country, but without the power and support of Aslan.There's a lot of CGI (Neptune rises from the sea, the earth splits, there are crossbow battles), but the strength, as in the previous film, 'The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe', is in the acting, which keeps the story moving along. This may not be the story as fans know it (and as depicted in the BBC production twenty years ago), but it works well. Romance between Caspian and Susan aside, this is a great film.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
31,zkonedog,As Middling As Its Source Material,5,28 February 2017,"The first Narnia movie was filled with adventure and magic. This sequel (much like its novel counterpart) cannot match that level of energy or excitement, instead resulting in just a so-so film effort.For a basic plot summary, ""Prince Caspian"" sees the Pevensie siblings Peter (William Moseley), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), Susan (Anna Popplewell), & Lucy (Georgia Henley) once more called back into the kingdom of Narnia. This time, they arrive at a beach surrounded by ancient ruins. After a bit of searching, and some help from dwarf Trumpkin (Peter Dinklage), they discover that they are all actually in the same place they used to live...Cair Paravel. Only many hundreds of years have passed and Narnia is now ruled by the Telmarines, more specifically King Miraz (Sergio Castellitto). The Telmarines want nothing to do with the ""old ways"" of enchanted Narnia, and instead rule like a traditional kingdom, where trees/animals/beasts are ""dumb"" again. The only hope? Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes), a Telmarine himself who just happens to have an intimate understanding of (and appreciation for) those ""old ways"" and wants to see them restored once again.For a long time, I viewed this movie as a complete and utter disaster. ""Prince Caspian"" completely turned a friend of mine (who loved ""Lion/Witch/Wardrobe"") off from the entire series...he didn't even watch ""Dawn Treader"". After recently reading the novel, however, I came to realize that this movie is only as good/bad as that source material, which is middling at best. Prince Caspian is not nearly as compelling of a tale as LWW, and no amount of movie magic can make up for that.One thing I truly did like about this movie is that it takes a few chances going off the story material. For example, showing the White Witch again (which did not happen in the novel whatsoever). I was surprised when I saw this film was almost two and a half hours long (I think I might have cut it down severely to quicken the pace), but the ""added"" material from the book actually composes some of the most interesting stuff of the film.Overall, then, ""Prince Caspian"" is just an average film based on a similarly average book. Try as it might, it cannot escape that limitation.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
32,filipemanuelneto,Inappropriate for avid readers.,6,12 April 2016,"This film is the adaptation of a C.S. Lewis book, from a series of novels called ""Chronicles of Narnia"". In this film, the four Pevensie's return to Narnia unexpectedly, to find it conquered by the Telmarines, humans who slaughtered the talking animals of the country. Directed by Andrew Adamson (who directed Shrek) has script by Andrew Adamson, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. The cast was headed by Georgie Henley (Lucy), Skandar Keynes (Edmund), William Moseley (Peter), Anna Popplewell (Susan) and Ben Barnes (Caspian), and counts with the voices of Eddie Izzard (Reepicheep) and Liam Neeson (Aslan).This film is a meritorious continuation of the previous film, ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"". And I say meritorious because it maintained the quality of previous film, yet not bring anything new or improve any of the negative characteristics of it. In fact, if I could choose the worst film adaptations of books, ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" was certainly included in the chosen list. For those who have read all the books and knew them well, this film is a disappointment as the previous one. It seems that the writers and the director (well, Adamson did both) didn't read the books but their resumes, or preferred to lighten things up and make a fifth category version of ""The Lord of the Rings"" (when the dramatic story of Tolkien has nothing to do with the vision, deeply Christian and didactic, of Lewis). Nevertheless, the film continues to work well, delighting the audience although the story does not have much appeal now, and Ben Barnes has been a weak Caspian largely due to that strange and jarring accent. So be warned: those who read the book does not need to see this movie. But, who didn't will certainly adore it.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
33,Rectangular_businessman,"Things never happen the same way twice, indeed.",7,4 June 2012,"I liked the first ""Narnia"" film. It wasn't perfect, but it was a very enjoyable and well-directed fantasy flick for the whole family.""Prince Caspian"", on the other side, takes a different approach, being darker and more serious, and while it still keeps some of the ""magic"" and good elements that the first film had, the truth is that (in my opinion, at least) this sequel feels a bit tedious in several scenes (Particularly the battle scenes), being way more dense and heavy-handed. It seems that Andrew Adamson decided to give Narnia the same treatment that Peter Jackson gave it to the trilogy of ""The Lord of the Rings"", in order to make it ""more epic"". This forced imposition results in a sober and well directed film, which sadly lacks of several of several of the enjoyable qualities that ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"".There are still some interesting scenes, though, but I think that this would have been a little bit more entertaining and better developed. Also, I think that The romance between Caspian and Susan was a bit forced, lacking of a more elaborate treatment, due the excessive focus in the battle scenes.Overall, this isn't a bad film, I just think that it could have been better. I guess that it is just like Aslan said, ""things never happen the same way twice"".",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
34,leplatypus,It's true: this war children sequel is even worst than the first (dad),1,6 May 2017,"I'm shocked, upset, disappointed and angry to see that Disney produces now movies about children as soldiers! Where is their so-called magic, enchantment, family values?? Unicef ranks war children as the worst war crimes but Disney makes it art, fun and just to have more money in their pocket!! That tells you how crazy is our actual world from top to bottom as it's a shame to notice that critics, medias really interested to tell this truth! Anyway this Disney movie begins in the worst way ever, because after the dreamy magic kingdom castle opening, your ears are attacked by a loud, pitched woman scream! Try to find me a old Disney with such violence; finally it sums up well the movie: blood, guns, violence again and again... All the fun, cool, gentle stuff of the 1st movie like the talking beavers have disappeared: now you just have a war academy for children: i'm just appalled to see that all siblings even the youngest take arms to kill the enemy (check the poster too)! And it's the best brainwashing you can have: you can hear them telling that striking first is better than defense and when they enter the village as winners, the populace greets them like the best dictatorship propaganda! So maybe the time when family programs were forbidden to depict guns, violence was better but if i was father, those stinking movies would go to the trash and i would inspire my children with more compassionate, authentic, caring values!",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

36,BaronBl00d,An Adequate Sequel of Sorts,5,19 January 2009,"I must confess that I was somewhat disappointed and underwhelmed with this film. It chronicles the adventures of the four children/kings and queens of Narnia as they are transported from an underground terminal in London to the world of Narnia much much later after their reigns. This world is being oppressed by a group of nearby men, etc... I think you get the general idea. The story and script were okay. The acting was decent, but the film lacks the heart, passion, and fun of the first film. It has some very good fight scenes - particularly an evening raid on castles, but some of the special effects(the centaurs) look ridiculous. Tilda Swinton has a small yet ""fun"" cameo as the white witch and Liam Neesom again voices Aslan. The ""kids"" are all fairly good too. The villain Sergio Castellitto is the best thing about the movie with a dominating performance. Ben Barnes as Caspian - YAWN! What does Andrew Adams the director do differently here? Well, the film is just not as lovingly crafted as the first Narnia picture it seems to me. This one seems rushed in some ways and it just doesn't have the magic I felt the first one had. It is not a bad film but not a particularly good one either.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
37,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Second trip to Narnia is more extravagant, dark and plot-heavy",6,5 January 2009,"While the Harry Potter series gets progressively darker and more mature from the first to last book, the transition from ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" to ""Prince Caspian"" is much more instantaneous. The result is that the film adaptation follows suit, which is good to know for fans of the books. At the same time, as classic as the C.S. Lewis world of Narnia is, it's still largely unfamiliar to moviegoers, unlike the world of Harry Potter, which provides about four installments before taking a dark turn. In ""Prince Caspian,"" we're thrust into the middle of a dark, rising conflict before the land of Narnia has yet to fully bloom in our imaginations. So as beautifully as director Andrew Adamson and crew have imagined it for us, the film centers a lot on battle plans and fights, not creating intimacy with the breadth of creatures that inhabit it as they fight to get their land back. It's been awhile since I read ""Prince Caspian,"" so I can't say if this is a fault of adaptation or direction, but in this 150 minute epic film there's a distinct lack of heartfelt magic.The story brings the Pevensie children back to Narnia with much haste, because in Narnia years, ages have gone by and the land has been taken over by the Telmarines, evil and murderous humans. Prince Caspian, heir to the Telmar throne, is attacked by his uncle, so Caspian flees and calls the Pevensies (once great kings and queens of Narnia) back in hopes to reunite both lands in peace. Of course Caspian can't reclaim the throne without a fight, and much battle ensues.Narnia is more vividly imagine than ever. Of all the recent fantasy novel adaptations, the world Adamson has created is by far second only to Lord of the Rings (Disney and Walden Media are likely much of the reason, but still). The film has a truly epic feel to it. The scenes of Telmar are grim and blue and the scenes near Aslan's tomb where the Narnian's hide out are crisp and golden.The plot of the film marches forward without pause, wasting no time anywhere, which may bode well for book fans because they could pack more in, but not for people looking for something more. It is a total sacrifice of character development. The script tries to make up for it in jokes, namely in the form of a courageous, swash-buckling mouse, but nearly all the humor falls flat in such a serious plot that is hard enough to follow at times that you can't enjoy much else. Also, while none of the acting is bad, it doesn't particularly stand out either and no big names are around to drawn you in except the lended voice of Liam Neeson once again as Aslan.Dark it is, but it's not that much less family-friendly than the first film. It is for a bit older of an audience, not too much, and is definitely geared more for boys with the fighting, but if you stick with it, the values of faith, courage, mercy, etc. are all there. It's a warm movie, it's just not a particularly ""magical"" one. You're not swept up in the lore of Narnia and loving everything you see and hear, feeling that so much is culminating in this battle. Adaptations of books like these are always a tricky business and while all the pieces might not be in place to get it all right, ""Prince Caspian"" did some important things well, especially in visually bringing this darker Narnia to life in a very watchable film that is certainly not a let down from the first film.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
38,funkyfry,A disappointing follow-up,4,12 January 2009,"I didn't care for this one as much as I did the original. The limitations start right out with the story -- I always thought Lewis' ""Prince Caspain"" was not as good as ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" or ""Voyage of the Dawn Treader."" None of the things that were done to the story to alter it made any improvement, either.There's something about the film that's more methodical, less inspired. It feels very far away from a good fantasy story, full of obligatory action scenes that weren't part of the original story. The Caspian/Susan romance is plodding and predictable... and what's up with all that mascara that Anna Popplewell is wearing in this one? Of course Peter and Caspian have a rivalry, and the most interesting characters, Edmund and Lucy, mostly have to sit around and watch others. The action towards the end looks nice, but ultimately underwhelming. And where the first film gave us an interesting allegory of the Christ myth, this one simply gives us some elements maybe from ""Exodus"" (crossing of the Red Sea) without any real idea behind them. They've become merely action devices.Another problem is the lack of a compelling villain. Tilda Swinton's performance as the White Witch anchored the first film, but this time we have just a buffoonish man as the villain (Sergio Castellitto) with no magic and no real influence over the audience. Also because the writers of the film brought the Pevensie kids into Narnia so quickly in the story (as opposed to the book where it doesn't happen for about half that time), we don't really have a chance to flesh out Caspian's character or to get to know him. Ben Barnes' performance doesn't help matters hugely.I'd still like to see these people do ""Dawn Treader"", if only because the story is better with more opportunities for Shadar Keynes, the only significant actor of the children, to shine. I would like to see Reepicheep better developed as well, and not simply used for comedy. One small hint of praise for Caspian though -- I really enjoyed the two significant performances of the little people actors, Warwick Davis and Peter Dinklage. Dinklage's eye-rolling and his quiet dignity are imminently watchable, and his relationship with young Lucy (Georgie Henley) provides an emotional core to the film otherwise sorely lacking in real heart.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
39,FiendishDramaturgy,Disney's Done It Again,8,18 May 2008,"Although CS Lewis's material appears as though stolen straight out of JRR Tolkien's mind, this second film adaptation is much more lively than TLTW&TW in that the character development is already out of the way, and the audience gets pure story. Our quartet have not outgrown their characters, and it was lovely to see Warwick Davis as Nikabrick.This series, while disgustingly simplistic in its non-vocabularic writing style, is thought to be so deep and complex, as to require entire literary classes/courses devoted to the understanding of it. It is, however, nothing more, really, than a lesser, watered-down version of a greater (and I'm stating opinion, here!!) purloined story. There is nothing here, which wasn't found in that original work, yet some WiLL go on and on about the genius of it, in spite of the factual evidence, which states loudly and clearly that there is nothing original or creative herein. One has but to read the little short stories to understand that the mind, which wrote this, was neither literary, nor brilliant.HOWEVER, the movies FAR outreach the little children's stories, do NOT hide the darker side of reality from the audience, and strive to teach a lesson (however secular and more's the better) as the focal point of the individual little works themselves. Their literary counterparts are not little masterpieces, and that goes far more the way of showing the intelligence and creativity of the Disney SCREENWRITERS than CS Lewis. If you've read the little stories and can be honest with yourself, then you know what I mean. And Disney did a marvelous job in weeding out all the religious references which do not belong, and adding in a little bit of Magick. Great job, Disney! As usual.This film adaptation is beautiful; fleshed out in a way that works. Every added element is done so in such a way as to pay respect (however undue) to the original literary work by added in something which was lacking in the story, rather than changing the plot to suit the need for a franchise.All in all? It's a GREAT movie for the family, although some of the smaller children WERE frightened and DID ask to be taken home. As I said, this movie does not attempt to hide the stark reality of death and cold deeds from its audience. This is darker than its predecessor, and holds more intrigue, action, and dark deeds. Aside from that, this is pretty much meant for everyone, and judging from the diversity in our audience, I'd say it hits that mark.It rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
40,freemantle_uk,Fun Fantasy Film,8,6 July 2008,"I have just been to see Prince Caspian and I found it to be an enjoyable experience, better then Indiana Jones and the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrode (2005). The film is set a year after the events in the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrode in Earth time, but 1300 years in Narnia time. A race of human called the Telmarines had taken over Narnia. The Lord Protector of the kingdom, Miraz (Sergio Castellitto), has a son at the beginning of the film and that means his family line could take over the kingdom. He orders the assassination of the rightful heir, Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes). He luckily runs away and heads to the forest where some of the creatures of old still live. He calls on our heroes from the last film, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy to help form an army and reclaim the throne. Aslan has disappeared and the other Narnian had died.This film is more action packed then its predecessor, and has a darker tone, showing characters dying and not just being frozen. The religious message is also toned down, only a ending suggests a message about redemption, but it not so obvious as the message of sacrifice in the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrode. It is still light-hearted enough for kids to enjoy. Eddie Izzard and Peter Dinklage offer a little comedic relief as Reepicheep the mouse and Trumpkin the dwarf. Reepicheep was in the mold of Puss-in-Boats from the Shrek films and Izzard was good and Trumpkin was similar to Gimli from Lord of the Rings, comedic, but able and willing to fight. I also thought that the end battle scene was very good, with the Lord of the Rings in the back of the film makers minds. They was also a good scene when the Narnians attack the Telmarinian castle.They are few things I didn't like about the film, the lighting when the film was set in night so dark that that it was hard to see anything. Compared to a film like the Incredible Hulk which its final fight scene was set at night, it was still easy enough to see what was happening. I also didn't think Ben Barnes was a good casting choice. Prince Caspian was meant to be a underage to rule the state, but in the film he looked like he was in his late teens/early twenties. I would have casted someone that looked fifteen/sixteen, making it a little more believable. Finally for a family film I thought that it was a bit too long, it was 2 hours 20 minutes. I think a family film like this should have been around 2 hours at most.I have not read the Narnia books, so I can't judge it compared them, but as a film is entertaining.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
41,dfranzen70,Likable sequel is action packed,7,8 January 2009,"The great news is that if you’re already a fan, or if you were a fan of the first movie, it’s not likely you’ll be disappointed with the followup offering.In the sequel, the Pevensie children (Lucy, Edmund, Susan, and Peter) are back in London, after the war, back to their humdrum lives. But naturally, they can’t stay in London for long, so soon they find themselves back in Narnia. Only it’s not quite the Narnia they remember (back when they were kings and queens there), because Narnia time moves quite a bit faster than London time - it’s now 1300 years after the kids were last there, although only one year has passed for them personally. They soon find themselves in a conflict between the native Narnians (i.e., talking animals, trees, centaurs, and so on) and the human Telmarines. The Pevensies decide to help the ousted Prince Caspian reclaim his rightful throne, thus allowing the Narnian creatures to live happily ever after.The film has many rousing action scenes, but not so many that you feel like you’re in a whirlwind of CGI and arrows and blades, as with some fantasy movies. Director Andrew Adamson, who directed the first LWW film (as well as all three Shrek movies) keeps the film moving, allowing us to catch our breath occasionally - but not much more. Filmed in part in New Zealand, the grand, sweeping battle scenes feel like they’re straight out Braveheart.We get some character development as well, as the kids mature believably from start to finish, just as they did in the first one. The boys can sometimes be snotty brats, but I suppose that’s more of a British attitude than just a childish one; the girls, conversely, are resolute and wise. Particularly wonderful is Anna Popplewell as Susan Pevensie, the archer with a heart of gold. Popplewell makes a commanding, compassionate queen, and she’s so gutsy and determined in her performance that every line she delivers will send shivers down your spine.Perhaps the greatest accomplishment of this followup, though, is that the movie is a success even though the most prominent character in the books is absent for 95% of the film. That would be Aslan the lion, voiced by the inimitable Liam Neeson. Aslan, the symbol for Christ, showed up in the nick of time in the first movie to help save the day, but here he’s just not around. Why hath he forsaken the Pevensies? There are some pretty intense battle scenes (although largely bloodless), despite the PG rating, so you may need to be careful with the littlest ones. But it’s a Disney movie, so don’t expect anything nightmare inducing. Other than talking animals, of course",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
42,MaxBorg89,The Chronicles continue...,8,7 July 2008,"""You may find Narnia a more savage place than you remember"" the dwarf Trumpkin (Peter Dinklage) informs the Pevensie siblings, Peter (William Moseley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Keynes) and Lucy (Georgie Henley), as they return to the enchanted parallel world a year after the events of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Trumpkin's warning isn't just meant for the protagonists: he's also telling us, the audience, that Prince Caspian is going to be a darker affair (well, as dark as a Disney fantasy picture can be, anyway) than the previous movie. And as with the Harry Potter series, ""darker"" is, most of the time, synonymous with ""better"".As I said, a year separates the events in the two films. A human year, that is: in Narnia, more than a thousand years have passed since the Pevensies left, and the consequences aren't that pleasant. The Narnians have all gone into hiding in the woods, driven away by a humanoid race called the Telmarines, currently ruled by the cold Miraz (Sergio Castellitto), who only cares about power and dismisses the tales of old as rubbish. Once his wife gives birth to a son, he decides it's time to get rid of the legitimate heir to the throne, his nephew Caspian (Ben Barnes), who however succeeds in escaping and joining the rebellious Narnians in their quest for peace. Add the Pevensies and (possibly) some help from Aslan (Liam Neeson), and it looks like Narnia could become a wonderful place again.The main strength of the first movie was director Andrew Adamson's ability to come up with a magical universe people could believe in, using CGI, sets and good actors in equal measure. That quality is retained here, and since the key characters are already well known, and the new ones introduced in a quick yet effective way, Adamson manages to to keep the pace of this more action-oriented sequel fairly consistent. Prince Caspian is also more ""adult"" than its predecessor, especially as far as the battle scenes are concerned: there's no blood (it's still a PG movie we're talking about), but at least the director doesn't always cut away as soon as someone's about to bite the dust like he did the first time around. Also more ""mature"", but less effective, is the decision to insert a lovey-dovey subplot involving Susan and Caspian which a) wasn't in the book and b) slows down the film for no valid reason at all.Cast-wise, the returning actors are as good as they were before, whereas the new faces (or voices) are a bit of a mixed bag: Dinklage, Warwick Davis and particularly Eddie Izzard, who lends his vocal cords to the adorably witty and energetic mouse soldier Reepicheep, are as convincing as one would expect them to be, but Barnes, who is supposed to carry the film, struggles to really impose himself, mostly because of the Spanish/Italian accent he has to use (the Telmarines are of Mediterranean origin, apparently). Castellitto is also a problem, in a way: he is a damn fine actor, as all connoisseurs of Italian cinema will know, and he is ably supported by fellow countryman Pierfrancesco Favino (whose character is, however, meant to be French, at least judging by the name), but like all Italian actors he lacks the OTT coolness mastered by British or Scandinavian thespians who play similar roles in Hollywood blockbusters. In his defense, though, it can be said that Miraz wasn't that much of a villain in C.S. Lewis' original text either, which is probably why the writers decided to divert from the book briefly in order to bring back Tilda Swinton's White Witch in a five-minute scene that is indisputably the best in the entire film.In the end, fans of the first movie will enjoy this one too, while those who were turned off by the excessive lightness in tone of the inaugural chapter (this is post-Lord of the Rings, after all) should be satisfied by this more action-packed, darker and ultimately better sequel. Otherwise, just wait for the next one.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
43,Fluke_Skywalker,Prince Caspian is a royal disappointment,6,7 August 2015,"Lacks the sense of wonder and discovery of the first film, but then again you can only discover once I suppose. Villain is dull and conventional compared to the White Witch (but aren't we all), and there's really not enough story here for the nearly two and a half hour runtime, making the whole thing feel stretched out. Worst of all, the Pevensie kids are watered down and then shoved aside to make room for the oatmeal-bland title character. On the plus side, it's a beautiful film to look at, and there's Peter Dinklage, always a plus.It has its moments, but it's a step or two back from 'The Lion, Witch And The Wardrobe'.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

I like the fresh new story and the fact that all four of the youngsters remain, but the change from dark, snowy settings to plain, summer-like conditions means the film does lose some spark. There's also much less intrigue with the villains.Georgie Henley (Lucy), William Moseley (Peter), Anna Popplewell (Susan) and Skandar Keynes (Edmund) are again enjoyable in their roles. Liam Neeson, just barely, reprises his role of Aslan - his inclusion does feel forced, as great a character as he is.Away from those four, you have a number of new faces. Ben Barnes (Caspian), Peter Dinklage (Trumpkin), Warwick Davis (Nikabrik) and Eddie Izzard (Reepicheep) are my standouts. Barnes is solid, I liked watching Caspian. Dinklage is great, while Davis and Izzard are welcomed newbies. Like the first film, the casting here is done astutely.They definitely should've shortened this though, the ending does drag a fair bit.

The only problem is that they didn't give anyone a good understanding of what the Narnian's were fighting for. The movie did very little to tell us why the good people were good and why the bad people were bad. I guess they were assuming that everyone saw the first movie, except I wasn't one of them. The movie starts out in the dark state that the world is in and then continues a story similar to the lion king where the bad king has taken over and the hope of Narnia is that the good king(aka. Prince Caspian) can somehow take over and make everything wonderful. The acting didn't help bring out the good or bad either with pretty mediocre performance all over making me care even less about the story. The battle scenes are most of the story, hence this is why I call this a war movie where we don't really care who wins and who loses unless you are sympathetic about the blasé characters. Supposedly this movie was better than the first.which doesn't make me want to see the first anytime soon. Certainly those ads were wrong, hopefully!!

But Narnia is not as they remember it. The Narnians have disappeared, the great halls of Cair Paravel fallen into ruins. Many years have passed since their last visit. And it is not happy times. Narnia has been invaded by Telmarians, the Narnians are driven to the brink of extinction. A great battle ensues for survival of Narnia...Comments: First off, this is a movie listed as Family. I do not think I agree, it is certainly not for the younger kids. Instead this is a quite violent movie, even if most blood that would (should) have been there is removed. It is a tale of a desperate fight, a great battle and decisions made by sword. This is a tale of deadly battle. Do not expect otherwise.But for us older kids who like fantasy and a good-sized battle it is a good movie. Most creatures that appeared in the first movie returns, even though there are few characters returning.Sure, for the sake of being a family-movie, the blood is removed. But there are some good swordplay, and some good-sized battles as well. There are magic, and treachery. There is hope, and a hint of love.

They must join forces with the exiled young Prince Caspian to overthrow his cruel uncle and restore Narnia to its former glory.The sequel to The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe is every bit as good as the original, if not better. It speeds straight into the action, sets up the story quickly and memorably, and the transition to and from Narnia via the underground station is terrific. The movie is centred around two grandiose battle sequences, both of which are exciting and visually dynamic, but it also introduces three key new characters - Caspian the eponymous hero, Trumpkin the sour-faced dwarf, and Reepicheep the valiant warrior mouse, all brilliantly played/voiced by Barnes, Dinklage and Izzard. Barnes' Caspian is handsome and noble but also thoughtful and gently understated, Dinklage has all the funniest lines and is just as heroic as anyone else in the picture, and Izzard is perfect as the ultra-valiant, ultra-violent Reepicheep. The returning cast are all good - I especially like Keynes as Edward, who is playing radically different from the first movie but makes the transition wholly believable, but Castellitto is also good as the frothing-at-the-mouth villain Miraz, and even Swinton has a scene-stealing bit reprising her role as The White Witch. The effects shots are wonderful as our heroes swoop through the air, charge through underground tunnels or scurry across battlements, and Harry Gregson-Williams' traditional score soars along with them, top-notch orchestral fantasy adventure music. The movie is very faithful to the book and Narnia's mythology (including the more conservative aspects sometimes criticised by other writers), just as it should be, and is terrific fantasy fare from start to finish.

48,eric262003,Poor Sequel to a Classic Story,5,9 June 2009,"I remember reading the first installment of ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe"" in the fifth grade and it really touched my soul in a devastating way. I loved the first part so much I kept reading the other parts and it was a very enchanting experience to say the least. They made various adaptations of the C.S. Lewis novels and several animated series too which were always entertaining. When I saw ""The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe"", I was amazed by the beauty, the colors and sets, the costumes, the brilliant fighting scenes and the scintillating acting. Sure Lewis opposed his books to become a propaganda staple, but it captured the spirit to the novel splendidly and quite accurate for a book adaptation that's a rarity.Unfortunately the sequel ""Prince Caspian"" was a rainstorm to its predecessor. It was ultra-violent and not aimed towards the general public. And though the New Zealand location was visually stunning, the movie was very unsettling and never once does it follow the traditions to the book. Peter (William Moseley) acts like he's taken a few pages of Mel Gibson's script from his classic movie ""Braveheart"" and Susan (Anna Popplewell) gives you the impression that she's like Lucy Lawless' Zena. The beheading scene perpetrated by Peter sparks no significance to the series at all or any theme to it all for that matter.Okay, we can't blame media for why we commit acts of violence, though it has been the blame millions of times before. And I don't mind the occasional violent scenes myself. Even several family films have violence implemented in their movies and that's against our control. We can't change the world we live in, but gratuitous violence just for the thrills in a movie like this was executed far too randomly for my taste.Make no mistake I like tough female characters (including Zena) and Braveheart ranks as one of the best movies I ever watched, but the writing, and the direction was handled in a very pedestrian way. I'm sorry I ever let eyes on this film. I'm sorry for Mr. Lewis that I ever purchased the ticket to this debacle. I'm going to keep a careful eye on the third installment and if this trend takes a downward spiral, I'm just not even going to bother watching the rest of the series.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
49,winner55,Expensive B-movie,6,7 December 2008,"The first Narnia film had two great difficulties - it was a heavy-handed, openly Christian allegory that could put off a great many non-Christians (including myself), and, guided by this heavy hand, it was ponderous and slow. Only the undeniably beautiful visuals pulled one through the duller moments of the film.This sequel has, thankfully, removed those difficulties. The pacing is rather spry, and the allegorical elements are almost completely removed.However, in removing those difficulties, others surface which were not so obvious in the first film. The principle of these is the acting of the four leads who reappear here from the first film. Clearly, they are put in parts beyond their capacity, parts that any child actor would have a difficult time performing; that's partly the fault of story author C.S. Lewis, who had a not very happy childhood and who lost touch with what it really meant to be a child. Admittedly children want to imagine themselves in all sorts of impossibly grand heroic roles - but they do not want the responsibility that such roles require and never decide how to respond to these, except on a visceral level. Better writers of children's' adventure like Mark Twain and Robert Lewis Stevenson understood this, and their child heroes know when they've run up against it and must turn to an adult for assistance. Here the adult (Aslan) is largely absent, and doesn't do much when he returns. So the kids are left to perform the functions of adults without the capacity to think like adults. Thus they end up appearing quite two dimensional.The crisper pacing also reveals a problem. The cinematography has been compressed in this sequel so that we are left with very pretty set-pieces, but no grandeur. We can then see that, except for the penultimate sequence concerning the children maturing in Narnia, this was also a problem with the first film as well. In fact, to be fair, it's a problem with all the more lavish epic fantasies being filmed today, a residual influence of the Star Wars films; what most SW fans fail to recognize (or just gloss over) is that the universe of Star Wars is fundamentally inconsistent. Neither the various species nor the planets they come from could possibly co-exist, so visitations to the various planets becomes simply a series of well-designed set-pieces, we have no sense of the basic physics or biological principles holding them all together.Since Narnia is a single reality one would assume that consistency would be rather easily accomplished; but in fact it gets lost again and again. The conquistador-like army is intentionally out of place (since their ancestors actually came from Earth), but this intentionality doesn't help much, since after so many years in Narnia they should have shown some adaptation to a magical landscape. Their castle city is also a bit of a mess - it's so large from the outside, yet we see so little of its inside that we wonder whether these people actually engage in the activities of daily living that must sustain such a population.Narnia too is a bit of a mess; for example, the sudden re-emergence of the trees giving battle at the end seems so inappropriate as to be unbelievable, since there has been no visual preparation for it, only Lucy's recurrent lament that the trees don't talk to her anymore (talking trees and warrior trees are not the same thing).On the plus side, the movie has the best CGI in it I've ever seen. And the battle sequences are exciting and appropriately ""epic."" But the plot is shot with holes (in their strategy conference, none of the leads nor the Narnians suggest the obvious strategy of a peoples' uprising against a large professional army, guerrilla warfare), and not fully developed (the central narrative of the young Prince's struggle to achieve the throne gets so shunted to the side, it loses credibility).So what we are left with is a multi-million dollar B-movie - an undeniably exciting action film for a Saturday afternoon, but really not much more.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
50,moviewizguy,A New Age Has Begun.,7,28 December 2008,"The four Pevensie children return to Narnia, only to discover that hundreds of years have passed since they ruled there, and the evil King Miraz has taken charge. With the help of a heroic mouse called Reepicheep, and the exiled heir to the throne, Prince Caspian, they set out to overthrow the King, once again with Aslan's help.Bigger, louder, and action-packed, much like every other sequel out there, ""Prince Caspian"" is, in my opinion, darker, more mature, and better. Though the plot is a bit weaker, I cannot help but get won over by the extravagantly staged action sequences and the darker feel. Although still not as great as the ""Harry Potter"" and ""Lord of the Rings"" franchise, it's still a step up from the previous film.This film is better paced and faster paced, even though the film is even longer than the previous. There are even more action sequences, which is probably good since it'll hold one's attention throughout. However, within minutes, we're back in Narnia with the kids. I'm kind of sadden by the fact that we wouldn't spend more time in the real world. I still don't have a clue where they are in the real world, whether the kids are back with their parents or whatnot or if the war is still going on. I guess they call the films ""Narnia"" for a reason: Spend as little of time as possible on Earth and most of the time in Narnia.In the last film, I complained about Anna Popplewell's performance. Now I'll like to say, being more mature and with better dialog, her character does not annoy me as much anymore. Actually the kids are secondary characters, since Ben Barnes, playing the Prince, is newly introduced into the movie. Even Liam Neeson has a limited screen time, as well as a fairly short cameo by Tilda Swinton, who made the first film good because of her great, dark character.Apart from those flaws, ""Prince Caspian"" is a step up from the previous film. I like the fact that it's more mature, darker, bigger, louder, and more epic, if possible. Nonetheless, this film would entertain the young and the old, although I still think the filmmakers can do better than this. I really hope they add a little more magic.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
51,dunmore_ego,The Chronic Kills of Narnia: Prince Hasbeen.,4,26 July 2010,"Has stupider become the new darker? Everyone thrills at describing how PRINCE CASPIAN, the second movie in THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA series, is ""darker"" than its predecessor, THE LION THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE (2005).But they lost me at pasty, delicate, British kids playing pretend ""warriors."" I'm just not buying any of it. Every time William Moseley introduces himself as ""King Peter the Magnificent,"" milk shoots out of my nose whether I'm drinking it or not.In director Andrew Adamson's followup to his above-mediocre WARDROBE, we catch up with our four ""heroes"" back in snooty old London, Peter (Moseley), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), Lucy (Georgie Henley) and Susan (Anna Popplewell, whose drab gray schoolgirl outfit is simply an invitation for me to lock the doors, break out the hand lotion, and popple well). They aren't there long, as a crisis is brewing in Narnia, and indeterminately-Euro Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes) blows his magic horn to summon them back to the land of annoying talking animals.It is hundreds of years since they left and Narnia has become at least as savage as any given petting zoo. Cos it's ""darker,"" see. Caspian is the ""rightful"" heir to the Narnia throne and a knight who looks like Jean Reno (Sergio Castellitto) is trying to kill him and claim it for himself. Having the ballsac of a mosquito, Caspian calls on the magical help of the Kings and Queens of Olde. He's right to be disappointed when Peter, Edmund, Susan and Lucy appear, although he does end up making eyes at Susan for three whole seconds. More than enough sex for a Disney feature.Still, there's sure a lotta killin' for a Christian kid's movie - bloodless, to be sure, but those pasty Brit kids seem to revel in their bloodthirsty magical weapons taking lives.The overarching storyline is that of Prince Caspian uniting all the annoying talking animals in a war against Jean Reno - but movie is nothing more than battle after battle, broken up by boring slow passages where people whine about Aslan the Lion (Liam Neeson) not being around. Which makes you wonder why the golden furball waits until the end of the film to turn up, roar a little and tell Lucy ""Things never happen the same way twice."" Great excuse, lion! Right up there with ""She lost the will to live"" in the George Lucas Movie Reasons For Dummies book.A night raid on Reno's castle achieves nothing; simply a good excuse to get more Christian killing done, and allow Peter to voice his embarrassing battle-cry, ""For Narnia!"" in slomo. And when Susan climbs on the back of that centaur - now Disney, you're making me think bad thoughts again.Desperately trying to be LORD OF THE RINGS - and failing with a badger up its gollum - the final phoney straw comes when the TREES join the battle, in what looks like The Battle of Pellenor Fields meets Los Angeles Petting Zoo.Tilda Swinton cameos as The White Queen, and when Caspian tries to touch her, Susan gets pouty! - even though she never expressed any interest whatsoever in him! Like every chick who expects you to pine after her even though she gives no indication she wants you to pine, Susan sulks like a high maintenance girlfriend when Caspian seeks elsewhere what he knew he was never gonna get from under her heavily-fortified Disney skirt.It's about then that Caspian realizes he's just a glorified extra and fades into the middle background peacefully.Arrogant snot High King Peter Of The Unearned Title challenges Reno to a mano a mano duel, goes striding out with his MAGIC SWORD by his side - and STILL can't bring down the mortal man fairly! Either Reno's excellent fighting skills can circumvent magic, or I'd be hunting down Santa Claus to get my money back on this ""magic"" sword that refuses to find its mark.Point of this solo battle was to avoid full scale war, yet after they pad twenty minutes of Peter getting his magic-sword-wielding ass handed to him by a REAL knight - they launch into full scale battle anyway. To pad the film until Aslan turns up and roars. More magic stuff. Deus ex Machina water spirit eats Jean Reno. Kids go back to London after whining over how much they'll miss Narnia until funding comes through for another sequel.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
52,Cosmoeticadotcom,Solid,5,19 September 2008,"One of the major problems with all film series is what might be called middle filmitis. This is when films that are not first in a series rely too heavily upon an audience's memories of earlier films to inform them of the traits of characters, the chronology of prior events, and a general knowledge of the world the film series is set in. Such is the case with the latest C.S. Lewis adapted book, The Chronicles Of Narnia: Prince Caspian. Oh, yes, there are other major flaws in this film, which I shall limn, but middle filmitis is the overarching ill that infects all others. The same was not true with the first film in the series, The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe. When I reviewed that film I started out by stating that that film was 1) a more literate and less Byzantine Lord Of The Rings, 2) a deeper and more realistic Harry Potter, and 3) a more mature Oz.Well, all three claims are still true, however the series has taken a sharp downward turn toward LOTR's Byzantine darkness, Potter's shallowness, and the puerility of Oz. Prince Caspian is not a bad film, merely a passable special effects film, filled with all sorts of magical beings. Yet, part of middle filmitis creeps in right at the film's outset, when a child is born and a young man flees for his life. We know nothing of the situation, yet the film's camera work and musical score intone great drama and import into a depiction the viewer is in no way invested in. Then we see the returning children from the first film: (in ascending order of age) Lucy (Georgie Henley), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), Susan (Anna Popplewell), and Peter Pevensie (William Moseley). Yet, and here is a critical point, it takes a while for the first names of our heroes to be mentioned, thus leaving first time viewers at a loss, and the family surname is never mentioned in the whole second film. Some critics have harped on the fact that the Telmarines are all swarthy Spanish Conquistadore types, while the kids are Anglo whitebreads, but for this criticism to have any weight there would have to be a much more nuanced approach to the characterization. All the Telmarines could have been Girl Scouts, and it would not have mattered, for they all act in such manifestly 'bad guy' ways that their being swarthy Mediterraneans is an afterthought. Similarly, claims that the film relies too heavily on Christian iconography and a Colonial White Man's Burden mindset are rented by the utter shallowness of the screenplay. Christian/Schmistian- Aslan is just a magical lion, at home with any set of mythologies, not just the Christian one. Furthermore, since Adamson, as director, added story arcs the original book did not have, why did he not make some major changes to add zip to the tale? After all, Miraz is hardly a threat, and the fight scene between him and Peter is rather pathetic. meanwhile, the minute or two that the White Witch (Tilda Swinton) spends in the film, is far more intriguing. She would have been a far netter antagonist.Overall, The Chronicles Of Narnia: Prince Caspian is still better fare- especially for children, than any of the three overblown and pompous LOTR films, but, compared to the far superior first entry in this series, it is a profound disappointment. One only hopes that Adamson can parallax the first two films and take the few things that work well in this film, and add them back to the excellence of the first film, so that the third entry, slated for 2010, The Voyage Of The Dawn Treader, is the best of the trio. Elsewise, fans of The Matrix will be happy that their trilogy is no longer considered the most disappointing sci fi/fantasy series Hollywood has produced.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
53,Sirus_the_Virus,"I'll admit that I liked it, but it's a little flawed.",7,23 November 2009,"The four original cast members return for The Chronicles of Narnia:Prince Caspian. A good sequel but it's not as good as the original. It's a good piece of entertainment, but there are a couple of problems with it. Problem 1: The sequel has a bit too much action, a bit too many battles, and a little less of a plot. I don't think that that kind of thing works for a film like this. It seemed a little more like Lord of the rings than Narnia to me.Problem 2: The film kind of has a length that is unnecessary. I am pretty sure that it didn't need to be that long. This next one is also going to be down as problem 2. Ben Barnes, a newcomer, plays Prince Caspian himself. He has an obviously fake Spanish accent. An unnecessary one too, considering the fact that I don't think Caspian is Spanish. That is really all that I had wrong with this movie. I think it is good children's entertainment. Though not as good as the original, still good. It's a shame that not many people went to see it. That is probably why they they are releasing the next one in Decemeber. I can't wait.Prince Caspian:***/****",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
54,jaredmobarak,They used to danceChronicle of Narnia: Prince Caspian,8,16 May 2008,"Adamson decided not to treat the novel as scripture, but instead as a blueprint. While the backbone and important story points stay precise, the connections and interwoven threads reaching each checkstop have been liberated from the printed word. The filmmakers have definitely taken a somewhat slight book, (only 100 pages in the edition I own), and have crafted an epic of war, survival, and faith. A true movie that dares to stand apart from its source, Adamson and company have improved upon the series, bettering their debut effort and creating their own Two Towers type narrative.C.S. Lewis' novel has a story structure that makes it difficult for viewing. We learn about the titular prince through a long tale of his exploits from a dwarf to the Pevensie children. In movie form, this would be pretty boring stuff while we await the action to finally begin. As a result, the film jumbles things around in order to keep the fight fresh, slowly revealing the prince's past and origins while the children search to join him. Characters crop up in different ways; Aslan is pushed to the background much more than the book, (something I think improves the tale greatly), and events change to add more emotional and dramatic weight. While the novel shares the same progression, it does so in a much more matter-of-fact way, whereas this work allows us as viewers to dive right in and see higher stakes and a greater toll when it comes to the battleseven adding a battle that does not exist in the book at all. Relationships are more fleshed out and rather than be a bridge piece inside an epic history of Narnia, this film becomes a more complete tale, raising the level in all facets.The major difference, I feel, is the lack of blind faith in a Telmarine prince by the forgotten fantastical Narnian creatures. This prince, the rightful heir to the throne who has been compromised by his uncle finally bearing a son, means well, but comes from a line of brutal men that have all but wiped out the mystical powers of the land. Due to this fact, it would be rather silly for those being wiped out to take this boy at his word and join him to overthrow his own uncle, the self proclaimed king. We now, instead, get a more skeptical group of creatures not so quick to give their lives over to Caspian. The dwarf Trumpkin, who never bats an eye in the book to join his cause, is changed into a being that is unsure of everything going on. The fact that he is captured much earlier here then in the novel, (this ruins nothing for you), helps keep these feelings longer and makes him more realistic as he slowly converts into a believer. Even the centaurs and woodland creatures need some persuading before they enlist, something they don't even ask for, but instead throw a huge party, in the text.A battle between good and evil is on display and the fight is tense and well orchestrated. Due to the duel aspect of the final battle, the writers decided to add a more straightforward siege to compensate for the mono y mono warfare at the conclusion. The scene adds some nice weight and action, allowing the plot to progress a tad faster and be more interesting than without. By utilizing it as a chance to show the fallibilities of both Caspian and Peter, it lends more credibility to the idea of resurrecting a former evil to ""help"" in the fight against the tyrant Miraz. Also, it gives the supporting roles a bit more to do, especially Edmund and Susan who are more or less tertiary characters in the novel, (although extending their screen time added in a romantic bent for Susan that is not only glaringly unnecessary, but the one Hollywood cliché taking you out of the story ever so slightly).Fighting to save Narnia from extinction and to put a deserving man in the throne brings out the edge in these kids. The four Pevensies show some nice evolution from their roles in the first film, especially William Moseley who takes the duty of High King seriously. Anna Popplewell and Georgie Henley do their roles justice and Skandar Keynes adds some well-placed humor throughout as Edmund, the one who was the butt of most jokes previously. Ben Barnes, as Caspian, is kind of hit and miss. When he is on and natural, he succeeds very well, however, when he is given too much to do, Barnes shows some chinks in the armor. The accent the least of his problems, some moments just show his inexperience, but nothing too major to take away from the film overall. The real gems, though, are Warwick Davis as Nikabrik and Peter Dinklage as Trumpkin. While it's great to see Willow return to a meaty role in the fantasy realm, it is Dinklage's first foray into the genre that stands out. His acting is superb, his skill exact in both moments of candor and graveness.Succeeding across the board; improving upon the novel, not in substance, but in cinematic scope; and besting the original to be a bigger and better sequel, Prince Caspian definitely impresses. We see a side of Narnia that was missing in the first film as it set-up the rules and fantasy. With all that out of the way, we are treated to the inhabitants and lore of the land, the sincere need to keep their civilization thriving despite the usurpers who have taken control. Even the comedic side finds some elevation with my favorite role in the book translating brilliantly to screen. Tiny Reepicheep the mouse, wonderfully voiced by Eddie Izzard, steals the show and exudes the pride in one's country that you can see behind the eyes of every warrior ready to give their lives for it.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
55,vitaleralphlouis,A 100% Dismal Worthless Rip-off!,1,25 May 2008,"We both had a mindset that Caspian would be a good movie and that we'd enjoy it a lot. How disappointing that -- first of all, nothing significant happens in the first 30 minutes -- but later, nothing significant happens in the remaining 2 hours. The entire movie is pointless and stupid from start to finish.Children's stories can be an easy target to rip apart, but I don't mean that. We LIKE children's stories, good stories, stories that make sense and maybe also have a moral purpose. This ain't it.To begin with, the 5 leading characters have virtually no star appeal and/or character. All 5 are flat, boring people; and they remain that way for 243 minutes. Only the dwarf has any discernible personality. The movie cheats the audience over-and-over with their familiar cheap tricks. The bland and stupid dialog is mumbled at least 80% of the time. Action scenes, like the crucial sword-fight, are shot in extreme close-up (off focus) so we can't follow what's happening. The cinematography is just awful; all that great scenery and they give us an empty-head for the camera and lighting. The action is supposedly enhanced by the painfully familiar voom-voom-voom-voom music with a chorus screeching some incomprehensible shout.I think those people who foolishly entered a 10 or a positive review for this one either have no values regarding good movies, or perhaps it's paid-for by the studio. Hollywood has been buying good reviews for decades, no reason to think they've stopped because of the internet.Please don't waste your time and money on this awful film.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
56,Stampsfightclub,Clunky adaptation that doesn't have the spark and imagination of the first,4,24 September 2009,"The Pevensie children are transported unexpectedly back to Narnia where prince Caspian (Barnes) is in trouble from his Uncle who wants the thrown for himself.In the sequel to the world wide success of The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe director Andrew Adamson once more uses effective establishing settings and a long winded collection of fantastical ideologies for family entertainment, only this time sadly it does not work.The first adaptation of C.S Lewis' novels in 2005 was a heart warming collection of a family in crisis that have the imagination and determination to escape reality and the chance to explore a land filled with talking animals and fight for the right of the land.This second adaptation feels very clunky with mostly every part of dialogue feeling staged and ultimately cheesy and a bit of a gimmick.Such as when the four children arrive back in Narnia for the first time everything seems more dramatic than it really is. Every minor thing is a big deal, which isn't helped by the score which makes everything so over dramatic you feel like you're watching an x factor sob story. And when talking to people who have read the novels it seems the same vibe everywhere. Over the top for a family film.Of course this is designed as family entertainment but at a staggering two and a half hours with politically driven dialogue and occasional dark battle you start to doubt the intentions of the plot. The film sets the tone from the start as Prince Caspian is rescued by Albus Dumbledore from his Uncle and soon has to flee his rightful land. Then, amazingly conveniently, the four children are brought o safety just in time.From here we see once more why Narnia is such a good idea from Lewis. We see so much more than the previous hit release. From talking mice to dwarfs this really is sharp entertainment for the family, well perhaps just the young ones. The talking fighting mouse produced endless jokes about Puss in Boots from my friend and I, the formation of the oncoming soldiers reflected Lord of the Rings not to forget the numerous inclusions of references to blockbusters.The actors playing the children are not as sparkly and original as the previous release. Anna Popplewell's pouting when firing the arrows looks awkward whilst without a problem to overcome William Moseley is left to only frown at Ben Barnes, who in turn adapts a bizarre accent and speaking style that doesn't match any of his relatives.Had I read the novel beforehand I am sure this would have been a major crushing blow and can only feel sympathy for those who have and are left with this too long clunky over dramatic sequel that is more a modern release than a children's classic",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
57,fwomp,"Too Much Action, Not Enough Character",6,4 July 2009,"I think it's safe to say that the folks at Disney (the company that made this film) watched too much of THE LORD OF THE RINGS and tried – and failed – to emulate it. Epic battles, living trees, and much more are pulled directly from what we saw only a few years ago under Peter Jackson's able hands. And although THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: PRINCE CASPIAN has a few ""moments"" of its own, it fails to entertain anywhere near the first film, THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE.This is mostly due to the fact that we are rushed into battle scene after battle scene with little time to look at (and feel for) the characters. This is painfully obvious when we get 7/8 of the way through the film and still haven't seen Aslan but have been in so many fights that they begin to meld together. The Lord of the Rings never had this problem because the focus was kept tight on the characters, particularly the Hobbits. Which brings me to a positive point about Prince Caspian: the development of the friendship between Lucy (Georgie Henley, returning from the first Chronicles film) with that of the dwarf Trumpkin (Peter Dinklage, DEATH AT A FUNERAL). Although lightly touched on by comparisons with, say, Samwise and Frodo, the connection between dwarf and young queen was powerful enough to make me care a bit about what happened to them.The downsides, however, are just too numerous. The almost bratty nature of Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes (STARDUST) made the main character seem petulant rather than regal. And his continued arrogance toward Peter (William Moseley) was completely out of context with C.S. Lewis' novels. The repetitive battle scenes lead nowhere, and when Narnians die, we really don't feel any remorse for them as the viewer.That said, there's plenty of eye-candy in terms of CGI. It's everywhere. And it's almost too pervasive. But it is used well ...albeit often.The big question many may be asking is: ""Should I watch it?"" And the answer is a definite ""yes."" Although it's horribly flawed, it's worth watching for Lucy and Trumpkin, as well as the funny antics of Pattertwig the Squirrel and his deadly sword. And you'll need to be up on the film for the final release due out some time in the near future: THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER. Let's hope Disney gets that one right and we'll at least have two out of three in the positive corner.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
58,fernandoschiavi,"Prince Caspian is, in general, a competent fantasy film and an interesting new chapter to the series",7,23 January 2021,"Prince Caspian almost functions as an independent story. Much as a result of the enormous passage of time itself, which really leaves little more than memories of what we saw earlier. And, truth be told, this is good, as it gives the series a certain freshness and, as has already been pointed out, it diminishes the spotlight thrown on the actors who make the Pevensie, who remain one-dimensional in their roles.One of the factors that is inherited from the previous film is the lack of charisma of the main cast, who, unlike the trio of protagonists in the Harry Potter franchise (to name a similar series), never manages to transform the characters into really interesting or multidimensional figures. Instead, what we see are behavioral models that aim to make them more complex, but without success - and if the fights between Peter and Edmund previously set the tone for the dynamics between the brothers, the function is now transferred to the confrontations between Peter and Caspian, which serve only to emphasize the unfriendly, arrogant and immature nature of the former. And if we consider that Peter should supposedly emerge as a great hero in the film, the problem turns out to be serious - and the lack of expression of the actor William Moseley precludes any reversal of this picture.Of the protagonists, the most prominent here is the oldest, William Moseley, Peter, who at the beginning of the plot has a dispute with Caspian for the leadership of the group that will invade the castle and take the tyrant Miraz, self-proclaimed new King, from the throne. Little Georgie Henley also does a good job as Lucy, in getting all the love and charm her character has for the magical land. Others of the main cast, on the other hand, often seem to show no reaction or expression, or as in the case of Ben Bernes (who intervenes Prince Caspian) who ends up exaggerating his performance, transforming some dramatic moments into scenes of shame from others, image of a leader that Caspian should have. One of the exceptions is Peter Dinklage (better known as the iconic Tyrion Lannister in Game of Thrones) who demonstrates the great talent he has in playing the Narnian Trumpkin, often stealing the show from the Pevensie brothers. And if the vocal work done by Eddie Izzard, Ken Stott and Liam Neeson proves to be appropriate, even more impressive are the visual effects used to bring their characters to life, since the duelist mouse, the wise badger and the divine lion are creatures. absolutely credible in their movements, facial expressions and the way they articulate words.Prince Caspian's main defect, however, is exactly the same as that of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: the poor development of characters. Everyone, from the four brothers to the musketeer mice, are mere caricatures, one-dimensional beings that arouse very little or no identification with the public. The relations between them proposed by the script, in the same way, are equally poorly constructed, never leaving superficiality and the obvious, like the childish disagreement between Peter and Caspian (who should be the noble leaders, but look like two imbecile boys) and the hurried one romance between Caspian and Susan.The work of director Andrew Adamson, who also directed the first film, in general, is consistent in showing us the new Narnia after the era of heroes, where many of the creatures have disappeared and great ruins have formed in the places of great palaces. Scenes like aerial planes with the characters riding on plains, the excess of the resource in slow motion and moments like the horses in the river refer to the work of Peter Jackson in The Lord of the Rings. Although these sequences work within the context of Prince Caspian, it is inevitable that the film ends up losing some of its identity, becoming a kind of poor cousin of The Lord of the Rings. It is also important to note that Adamson changed his look on the Narnian style. As well as he reviewed his concepts when building the villains. The visual exhibition of White Witch gave way to the Latin stereotype. The Hispanic character of the Telmarines is an interesting detail. It creates a greater reality, but it escapes a little from the verisimilitude that the film establishes.Abducting certain conflicts and redecorating others, the script invests in forming a war film, distancing itself from the innocence of the first film, even if it falls into mushy conflicts, such as the unjustified rivalry between Peter and Caspian, and the climate of passion between Susana and Caspian. But if the ""crusade"" aspect would be enough to establish a relationship between the events of Príncipe Caspian and the history of religion in the world (and of all the countless deaths already caused ""in the name of the Faith"", whatever it may be), the religious - specifically Christian - character of the film becomes even more evident thanks to the way the lion Aslam is seen here: if, before, his presence made him a palpable, ""real"" figure, his distance during most of this continuation it helps to transform you into a truly mythical being, with aspects of divinity. It is not for nothing that Peter regrets, at a certain point, that Aslam does not send him any more ""proof"" that he is still present - and, in this sense, the film proposes an interesting allegory about how, for the followers of a religion, Faith implies in simple devotion to a purely abstract concept. Of course, being a traditional Christian, Lewis rewards his characters' belief with the definitive proof that it was well applied, as eventually the lion double of Christ represented by Aslam appears in flesh, bone and hair to assist his followers.Although a good part of the problems of the previous film are still alive and disturbing, the evolution in certain elements is clear, leaving hope for what may come in the next productions. The main hit is the slight change of tone between The Lion, the Witch and the Guard and the new Prince Caspian. What turns Prince Caspian into a question mark is his oscillations. Rather than rising to the next level, the director - and one of the writers - Andrew Adamson seems reluctant to make progress, even though he shows some signs of maturity. If before the scales hung almost to the fairy tale, without any sense of threat, now the approach is much closer to, for example, The Lord of the Rings, with more intense battles and a plot that really shows a certain danger for the people of Narnia. The battles, moreover, are once again one of the positive highlights of the project, alongside the animals. In the first one, the invasion of the castle, there is a whole strategy involved, something worthy of good spy movies. The other, the climax, is more grandiose, and shows another good differential in relation to its predecessor: it is much less similar to other adaptations of books for the cinema.The action scenes end up becoming the main highlights of the film, being very well executed and managing to leave the viewer apprehensive and with the attention totally focused on the feature, which, despite being almost three hours long, does not get to pass that feeling. As it addresses heavier subjects, such as the war waged between the population full of fantastic beings and Narnia-speaking animals against telmarines, this second film in the series is more crude and cruel. The plot works as a metaphor for adolescence itself, a stage in which people discover the adult world, abandoning childhood beliefs and innocence.Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian represents a maturation of the series, compared to the first film. Perhaps the maturation occurred too abruptly, due to the fact that the script is inspired by the fourth book written by Lewis. In other words, a lot has happened in the author's two books that have not become films. Art direction and photography sound tougher and darker, reflecting the moment in which the saga is. The visual effects convince and work with perfection when it comes to building (or destroying) colossal scenarios, but they do not emerge when you are charged for the grace and sumptuousness that some animals from Industrial Light & Magic had. Nor in great achievements of digital animation. The battle sequences (governed by shots that are too short) satisfy and are well rehearsed and panoramic. Apart from the exemplary improvement in photography, which lost its artificial aesthetic and gained a more brutal pattern without neglecting the diversity of colors we saw at the beginning of the series.With impeccable special effects, The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian is, in general, a competent fantasy film and an interesting new chapter to the series. Andrew Adamson manages to make the viewer believe in that world, even though the characters' intimate journey owes - and a lot. However, it is a more digestible, adult and serious work than the previous one. The main success of ""Prince Caspian"" is in turning many mistakes of the previous film into successes. Although not perfect, the film continues to work on religious and fanciful concepts that fill the eyes of the viewers, becoming a good film this season of blockbusters. Changing the innocence of ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" and gaining maturity with ""Prince Caspian"", it remains only to hope that in the next feature Disney will review the errors and build an impeccable film, since CS's work Lewis allows that.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
59,rbrb,Escape to Disneyland!,6,1 June 2008,"A quartet of school kids during the depressed 2nd world war years in London find relief from that era by escaping into a world of fantasy known as Narnia. Previously they found their way into this world through a wardrobe where they as Kings and Queens fought a wicked witch. This time they go through a portal in the subway(London Underground) to Narnia where they become royalty once more and are aiding a Prince to try to regain his Throne. Super special effects which make the movie quite good as do the talking animals and all types of magical exotic creatures, human and otherwise. A badger and a troupe of rodents steal many scenes in the film. Marvellously spectacular locations with excellently staged fights and battles. In my opinion the child actors lack the charisma and ability of say the children in the Harry Potter series, plus this picture goes on far, far too long. It is for these reasons I give it 6 and a half marks, but since I cannot give half's' my vote is: 6/10.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

61,Danusha_Goska,"Bad Theology, Muddled Plot, and Too Much Violence for Kids",4,18 May 2008,"Warning: This review reveals the end of the movie!""Prince Caspian"" is a violent movie. There is one fight to the death after another. Given that this movie is geared toward children, that violence is cause for concern. In any case, the violence makes no sense. How does an English schoolboy learn how to fight with a sword? How is it that an English schoolgirl hits every target she aims at with her bow and arrow, and no one ever hits her, her friends or siblings?The plot did not grab me. I had no investment in the Narnians or their enemies, who all seemed to be of Mediterranean descent. The theology was dangerous. A young girl has dreams and visions of a lion, Aslan, who, CS Lewis, the author of the Narnia books explained, is a Christ-like figure. Others don't see this lion. The Narnians undertake a mismatched battle against their enemies. They seem certain to lose, but the little girl is dispatched to fetch the lion, who sends a water sprite to destroy the enemy troops. Is this really the kind of approach to religion we want our children to have -- to undertake deadly enterprises and then wait for a creature a little girl dreamed of to rescue us with water sprites? On the plus side, the actors playing the British schoolchildren are cute and appealing.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
62,ja_kitty_71,An Enchanting Narnia Sequel,10,31 May 2008,"There had been a few adaptations of C.S. Lewis' classic series; But those adaptations over the years, are an animated TV special, and a live-action TV mini-series from BBC. So Narnia hasn't made it to the silver screen, until Disney and Walden Media decided to adapt Narnia to the big screen, with today's visual effects and excellent soundtrack to boot.In this sequel of ""The Lion,The Witch and The Wardrobe"" one year has passed in Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie's world. But unknown to them about 1,300 years has passed in Narnia. Now the land is now ruled by the Telmarines, a brutish human race who drove the old Narnians into hiding in the wood. And also a young prince Caspian who force to flee from home, when his uncle Miraz wants him killed on the night his son was born. Before he saved by a badger named Trufflehunter and a Black Dwarf named Nikabrik, Caspian blew on Susan's horn - the one given to her by Father Christmas. And now the Pevensie kids are send for back to Narnia. But they soon discover that things are now different in the enchanted land they had remember. Now with the help of the kindly dwarf, Trumpkin, Trufflehunter and Nikabrik, and a courageous talking mouse named Reepicheep, the Narnians, led by the Pevensie kids and Caspian, embark on a remarkable journey to find Aslan, rescue Narnia from Miraz's tyrannical hold, and restore magic and glory to the land.I don't have a favorite scene, because I love the WHOLE film from beginning to end; I do love Reepicheep and his band of mice.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
63,johnstonjames,"Pleasant, Congenial, Juvenile Fantasy Adventure",7,30 March 2010,"it's been so long since i last picked up a edition of 'lion,Witch, and the Wardrobe', and i'm sure i never read 'Return to Narnia', so i couldn't tell you how good this was as an adaptation. as a film, it was entertaining and diverting. at least it had more intelligence and imagination than most teen fantasy films or trilogies like 'Transformers' or the hopelessly infantile 'Harry Potter' movies.i never thought of 'Wardrobe' as being one of C.S.Lewis' great books. it's not on a par with his other works like the 'Peralandra' trilogies,'The Screwtape Letters' or even something like 'The Great Divorce'. probably because Lewis aimed at a largely adolescent audience with the 'Narnia' books, they seem simplistic in comparison.there is probably not a whole lot here that will rock the world of anyone over seventeen, but it was enjoyable entertainment that helps pass the time, which was pretty much what it was meant to do.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
64,Igenlode Wordsmith,I probably liked the book too much,5,10 January 2011,"I might have liked this film more if I had never read the book on which it was based -- I dare say I would have. (Its major flaw, from that point of view, is not that it makes changes to the plot but that it utterly loses the fairy-tale 'flavour' of the children's novel.)However, this really isn't my style of fantasy, and as a result the picture becomes yet another hack-n-grunt movie, with lots of 'yaargh' and sub-teenage attempts at humorous dialogue. I didn't get on with either ""Shrek"" or ""Lord of the Rings"", and this apparently has ambitions to imitate both. Despite the miracles of CGI, I didn't find the talking animals (or rather, the movements of the animals) terribly convincing either.I'll take ""Conan the Barbarian"" or ""Baron Munchausen"" (or even the space-age ""Barbarella"" and ""Flash Gordon"", which are really fantasy) over this sort of thing any time -- cheesy movies that are cheerfully over the top and thus in the spirit of their pulp-fiction forebears, rather than would-be epic that utterly misses the magic of legend come to life.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
65,jdkraus,"A bit different from the book, but thoroughly enjoyable",9,19 May 2008,"It's always hard to compare a movie adaptation off of a book to the original novel, for ""Prince Caspian"" is my favorite of the Narnia books. As a reader of the books, I will say that this very different from the novel with an added night battle at a castle, the resurrection of the White Witch, a small romance between Caspian and Susan, etcetera. Despite it's inaccuracies off the novel, I thoroughly enjoyed the film.To my surprise, the kid actors improved their acting talents. I found them to be bland and rehearsed in ""The Lion, Witch, and Wardrobe"", but with age, they have made themselves some decent young actors. The other cast members were pretty good too. Ben Barnes isn't a bad choice for Prince Caspian, (although I imagined him with blonde hair in the book). Sergio Castellitto plays a great villain as the vicious and bloodthirsty King Miraz. It was also nice to see Peter Dinklage as the dwarf Trumpkin and Liam Neeson as the wonderful voice of Aslan.Like the first film, there are a lot of amazing special effects. No doubt this should get an Oscar nomination for that department. In addition, the set-decoration/art direction, costume design, cinematography are exquisite and bring the world of Narnia back to life on the big screen. Once again, Harry Gregson-Williams delivers a magnificent score that carries the same tune as the first film, but it also has a darker and more mature sound to it.The one thing that surprised me about this movie though was the PG rating. I'm very surprised this wasn't a PG-13. Sure, the violence lacks blood and gore, but it is still intense, particularly with teenagers slicing through men like Achilles in Troy. For parents, I suggest you see it before you let your kids. 9/10",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
66,Hayden-86055,"Colourful and exciting, but lacking a great plot",6,19 January 2021,"Prince Caspian introduces Ben Barnes as one of the new main characters, he's not a bad actor but the character is different than in the book and rather annoying in how he keeps rebelling against any orders and won't, as well as the plot being far worse than Lion the Witch and the wardrobe.There are a lot of positives however, the effects are stunning and the scenery beautiful. The action is thrilling, even if some scenes are repetitive and drags on, it's definitely more ambitious than the first and even though the storyline is not very good the action and good acting do make up for it and turn it into a decent fantasy adventure.6/10: Pretty good",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
67,sashank_kini-1,The battle sequences were fantastic,8,17 May 2008,"I haven't been much of a fan or anything of the Chronicles series. The books haven't been read by me; I liked the first part part but not even to that extent. It didn't have much of the action and the dark atmosphere that I had wanted. None of the characters from the good side were actually killed nor even hurt that badly.Here, a number of good characters are showing slain by their foes and the children actually fight bravely. There are numerous magnificent battle sequences that hooked me up to the movie and kept me glued to my seat. In fact, I sent my sister during the intermission to get me snacks as I didn't want to miss any part of the movie.The starting was a bit dull to be frank but as the movie progressed, it became extremely exciting and interesting. The cast does a great job, especially the girl acting as Lucy and the boy enacting Edmund. Even the person acting as Caspian does a commendable job. The person who acts as Midas too does a great job as the evil and sinister king. The story unfolds very well and the battles were the most fun to watch. I wish Aslan had more to do. The white witch scene was unnecessary as she had almost nothing to do. I'm saying this because I loved the sinister lady in the first part and wished for more here. Therefore I was disappointed when she had almost nothing to do.Overall, it is a mind blowing film that would especially be loved by people who love some action. 8 out of 10.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
68,griffolyon12,An Entertaining Adaptation of the C.S. Lewis Novel!,8,18 May 2008,"The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian, is the follow-up to its 2005 predecessor: The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe. The first Narnia was an entertaining film, with tons of magic and entertainment, and was overall a very respectable adaptation of the popular children's novel; so the question is, did the filmmakers succeed in making this return trip to Narnia worth while? I am sad to say, that even though this trip back to Narnia is entertaining, it was not what I was exactly hoping for.The story once again follows the four Pevensie children: Peter, Edmund Susan, and Lucy; the ancient Kings and Queens of Narnia. A year has passed since the events at the end of the first film, and the four children have had trouble adjusting to life in the real world once again. Then, all of a sudden, the siblings are magically called back to Narnia by the blow of a magic horn. The horn was blown by Prince Caspian, who needed the help of the four kings and queens of old to reclaim the throne from his evil uncle, Miraz, who wants to usurp Caspian and take the throne of Narnia.Once the four children are back in Narnia, they learn that 1,300 years have passed in their stead. In this time the Narnian creatures have been forced to live in the now, non-magical forests of Narnia; the group enforcing this are the Telmarines, a race that invaded Narnia shortly after the children's departure 1,300 years ago. Prince Caspian is a Telmarine himself, but after meeting the Narnians, he begins to believe that magic is good and that the Telmarines are bad for trying to snub all magic out of Narnia. Eventually the four kings and queens meet up with Caspian, and the five unite to lead the Narnian creatures in a war against the Telmarines to regain control of Narnia.First things first, Prince Caspian has always been my favorite of the Narnia books, and in my own opinion had amazing potential to of been a superb film, but for some odd reason the magic seems to be missing. The film is action-packed, no doubt about that, but it seems to be missing this magical atmosphere that the first film, and the book, had. Part of this came in the rushed nature of the film, it felt like the filmmakers were somewhat pressured to get the runtime down to a more kid-friendly time, which made the film feel rushed to me. Another reason for the slight lack in the magical atmosphere, might have come in the fact that the film was missing some real character development, as well, it focused too much on Peter, and not enough on the title character Prince Caspian (played superbly by Ben Barnes). By the end of this two and a half hour epic I felt like, if I hadn't read the book I wouldn't have known truly who Caspian's character is, which is a shame, since he is quite possibly my favorite character in all of the seven books.Now the above paragraph may of seem liked I hated it, but I really didn't, there is still plenty to enjoy in Narnia. The directing by Andrew Adamson is slightly better this time around, as well the special effects are loads better than the first installment and are a lot more crisp in their presentation. Other strong highlights came in the acting, as I mentioned, Ben Barnes was truly fantastic in the title role of Caspian, capturing this wonderful character with the right amount of integrity, also the four other children have matured a lot as actors since the first film, all four delivering better performances on their second outing in Narnia; and the score was outstanding, Harry Gregson-Williams really bested himself with this one. Another thing that was truly wonderful in this film, was the scope was more grand and epic this time around than that in the first film, featuring some truly massive sets that are truly magnificent. The main thing though that most will be seeing this film for is the epic battles and action, and although the film does deliver on more action and battles this time around, none of the fights ever seemed to match the intensity, or creativeness of the one at the end of the first film, still the action was good overall. The best part of the whole film for me though, was getting to see Reepicheep, a small mouse who is a knight of Narnia; Reepicheep, voiced wonderfully by Eddie Izzard, gives this dark film a little bit of comic relief.All in all Prince Caspian is a good sequel, and I am greatly looking forward to the future of this film franchise. This film was a much darker outing than the first, boasts more action, and still has a fair amount of emotion (in particular the ending) to satisfy the audience, I just wanted maybe a little bit more from it than it delivered, but, oh well.I give this film a good 8 out of 10!",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
69,Eumenides_0,Another Fine Addition to the Narnia Movies,9,18 August 2008,"I almost missed watching this marvel on the big screen. But I'm happy I did: Prince Caspian combines a delightful storyline, imagination and extraordinary special effects to create a magical movie that alternates between the dramatic and the epic.Prince Caspian is a movie for children and for any adults who don't have a desert for a soul and want to relish in the pleasure of sheer fantasy. It's superior to the also thrilling The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe: it has sharper, smarter dialog; more heart; a more elaborate story; better acting, no doubt helped by a bigger number of adult actors this time (although Georgie Henley still steals the show every time she's on screen: one look at her and you know she's loving every minute on the movie); the special effects are better; the battles are bigger (still too bloodless); the music more intense (glad Harry Gregson-Williams is still aboard); and the fantasy is wilder: in addition to talking lions and centaurs and minotaurs there are now walking trees and sword-wielding mice. Magnificent! The plot is straightforward: Prince Caspian, the rightful heir to the kingdom of Narnia, claims the help of the Pevensie brothers to defeat a human who has usurped the throne and launched a war of extermination against the magical creatures of Narnia. The sense of dread, the atmosphere of doom in this movie is far more intense than in the first one. The action is also faster: I was amazed at how quickly the Pevensies were sent back to Narnia, and I was glad to see their reaction was the same as mine: time to have fun again! I recommend Prince Caspian to anyone who wants to have a good time.Unfortunately now begins the long wait for the release of The Voyage of the Dawn Treader.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

There's some stuff that doesn't make sense or seems like filler. It's also not as charming as the first one and most of that is probably because Lucy got older. Overall it's okay but it's long and not amazing so I'm honestly surprised it got a 3rd one. I dont really know who the audience to these movies are.,The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
71,loganx-2,Narnia's Made A Few Changes,2,12 June 2008,"This movie was terrible, Narnia was reduced to a couple of centaurs and some midgets hiding in a bunker(actually Peter Dinklage is one of this films few saving graces as Grumpy Dwarf or whatever). The children who at least were kind of interesting and conflicted the first time around are now all cock sure hot shots, who want to kick ass and take names as soon as possible. This leads to lots of fantasy fighting extravagance, which I found enjoyable, satyrs and Giant trees crawling over catapults etc.(though I'm pretty sure I saw this tree thing in the Lord Of The Rings The Two Towers) However like Speed Racer, any time these characters aren't fighting is dead time on screen. Prince Caspian is a dull, unsympathetic character, or at least portrayed so. Aslan the Lion, and The White Queen are all but absent here(when they are on screen, man does the movie brighten up), leaving only some very general kind of Arab eastern euro dirty white, otherwise text-book medieval bad guys, to face off against our fair English Royal heroes and their fairy friends. I did like the talking mouse, but aside from him the film took itself way too seriously. I enjoyed the first film, and story in general. But this was just very dull, run of the mill, fantasy.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
72,dfle3,"Doesn't have the magic of the first movie, still hope for series though",7,20 June 2008,"After the magnificent first installation of this movie series (it's a real 10/10 effort), the sequel takes a different tack. Whereas much of the pleasure of the first movie (""The Chronicles of Narnia: The lion, the witch and the wardrobe"") was with the Pevensie children discovering and interacting with the alternative world of Narnia, here there is much more an emphasis on boyzone adventure type stuff...fighting evil etc. Sure, that was in the first movie too, but here it is much more front and centre. The Pevensie children are summoned back to Narnia, unintentionally, by Prince Caspian, who has his wicked, power hungry uncle trying to take his kingdom with lethal force against him.Sometimes endless warfare or fighting can be really boring to watch (for instance ""Attack of the clones"", the Star Wars prequel, or one of those ""Planet of the Apes"" sequels). Fortunately, it doesn't get that bad in ""Prince Caspian"", though it does not reach the fascinating heights of military strategy as in the first ""Lord of the Rings"" movie sequel, or even ""Breaker Morant"". There is some interesting stuff concerning the initial steps of attacking a formidable castle. If wish-fulfillment is your thing, then sure, imagine yourself to be whichever Pevensie child you like the most, and substitute yourself for them in all the scenes where they display their kingly or queenly fighting qualities.Not having read the books, I can't say how well the movies follow them so far. Just looking at this movie, I have to say that I would have appreciated some more insight early on on how the Pevensie's absence from Narnia for the year has affected them psychologically (this movie is set a year after the events of the first movie in 'our' time, but many centuries later on when they re-enter Narnia. Thus you also miss the expected pleasure of re-visiting the fantastic creatures from the first movie). Another small gripe is also how quickly the Pevensie children adapt to being warriors. Although I have gripes about the Star Wars prequels, at least in the original trilogy Luke Skywalker had a path to tread before he was worthy of Obi Wan Kenobi as a warrior).It would also have been welcome to have the children more shrouded in mythology by the Narnians than seems to be the case. However, given that Aslan seemed to be doing all the leg-work, maybe that is acceptable!Anyway, there is some humour in this movie, but it's not as charming as in the first one. The ""M"" rating this movie has here in Australia seems appropriate. Whilst not being a bloody movie, there is plenty of swordplay and death and dark themes.Hopefully the sequels to this will return to more character based story-telling of the interesting kind found in the first movie. Wouldn't want another movie with mindless spectacle and nothing but fighting. My biggest gripe about this movie is that the central characters, the Pevensie children, seem to have nowhere to go as far as character development. I would have much preferred for the movie to show them developing into the kind of characters they already seem to have become in this movie. And that would have meant getting to see the children dealing with life after they initially left Narnia and also perhaps acquiring the skills that they seem to have acquired effortlessly for this sequel.I'd give this movie 7 and a bit out of 10.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
73,TaylorYee94,Susan Pevensie before Katniss Everdeen and Kingdom of Narnia before 7 Kingdoms,7,4 March 2021,"'Prince Caspian's is still a good-quality movie with advance technique at that time such as motion capture, but it fails to catch up with all the expectation after 'The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe'.What's better.Bigger scale. I can tell the director really put much effort on battle scenes. The level of two battles in the movie can compare to that of epic movies. Bigger roles for female characters. In the previous film, Susan really does not use much of a bow and arrows, and sisters' role in the battle against winter witch is very minimum. However, this time, I can see more of Susan's engagement in action and in leadership, and Lucy is the key factor in winning the war.What's worse.Leap of events and logic + More coincidence. A plot seems scattered and disconnected. No explanation why Aslan never appeared for Narnia before it was destroyed and why Caspian refuses to kill King Miraz TWICE. If I look at the size of the Telmarine's army and the fact that Miraz killed Prince's father, it's hard to say it is a gracious, noble, or lofty act. I need more reasons that just Caspian's personality. Less attractive characters and less chemistry among characters. Prince Caspian is the worst addition to four protagonists, indecisive, ordinary, and bland. His lack of charisma reduces charms of Pevensies as well. Because audience is familiar with Pevensies, it would've been better if the director shows more and deeper side of Caspian's characteristics and emotions. The, the audience can understand him better and figure out his justifications behind his confliction against Peter. The director could have also focused on growing bond between Peter and Caspian because it is interesting topic to watch in the book.P.S. I HATE the scene when winter witch tries to come back to life. It does not even fit the story, stemming the tide completely. The ceremony before that in the movie is so shoddy and poorly directed that it feels like a puppet show.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
74,diac228,Does she ever actually run out of arrows?,6,18 May 2008,"Tired of the scenery known as the real world? Why, step right up and enter the wonderful land known as Narnia. Surrounding you will be plenty of beautiful scenery, hundreds of years of nasty conflict, backstabbing, rising tensions, impending warfare, and attempted genocide. Also surrounding you will be corrupt kings, feisty hostile creatures, wild animals, attacking trees, and enough action to not warrant another visit ever again. The best part is, despite all the hostility, deaths, violence, carnage, and intense material, the MPAA decided to throw in the ""PG"" rating because of the one main thing Narnia has: enough God symbolism to create sermons for weeks.Following you on this adventure is Prince Caspian, a prince who does not look his age, does not act his age, and darn it that gives hope to all of the hiding Narnians. However, his very own uncle wants him dead to claim the throne. This is what family does. With the four kids making a return, the five heroes will attempt to conquer the land that was once peaceful and try to bring harmony into the entire community. Helping them is Aslan, the lion from before. However, he is nowhere to be found. Can the kids and the smaller army of creatures win the battle against the forces of Conquistador Evil? Venture on, and you'll find out.The critters are the only humorous and vaguely positive things on this dismal trip into a bitter and traumatic Narnia. While this keeps the film remotely child-friendly, it does tamper with the mood of the trip. Doesn't help that you have creatures that literally come out of nowhere to give their two cents and offer their services. These critters are not as memorable as the ones in the first trip, and they do not have much character development either. And why on earth do we have a sequel to Puss-In-Boots here? The kids themselves are still not that interesting with the exception of the youngest one and Prince Caspian pretty much gets reduced to being something the ladies in the trip can fawn over endlessly. The villains themselves are much more threatening, but don't seem as menacing as the White Witch from the original journey. Sometimes, the trips into enemy territory looks like you are entering Spain in the Middle Ages; the actors portraying the enemies look Spanish, and even look alike in certain scenes.Directing the trip is the director of the original voyage, and also the first two Shrek movies, Andrew Adamson. His directing is a mixed bag; as the battle sequences are well-directed, but the one-on-one battles lack range, lack originality, and does the typical slow-down/speed-up action that we see far too often. Also, a sign that there isn't much complexity in the fights is when the subjects are too close to the camera. The cinematography suffers from the direction a little, but does have some great shots of the lush environments in Narnia. At least you know the area is beautiful as you battle into potential death.Easily the most awe-inspiring moments in the trip to Narnia are the special effects contained in the package. They are so amazing that you don't even realize that most of the characters joining you are CGI. The special effects are at their best whenever the two battles take place, which are both long, both satisfying, and maintain the voyage from being too much of a bore. However, you will be definitely be raising many questions throughout the quest for survival, and sadly, not all are going to be answered. More so, there will be events that will occur out of nowhere and there will be no time to develop them into coherence. Don't worry, they don't run far too long.Bottom Line: All right, let's get to the nitty, gritty. Kind of like the main flaw of the Matrix, why would anyone want to visit the alter-ego world when there's easily much more peril and suspense? Prince Caspian is a movie that's pretty much saved by the two epic battle sequences and the decent performance of the main character himself, which is sure to make the ladies swoon upon the first time they see him riding on horseback. But everything else about this fantasy movie just feels too been there-done that (Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter anyone?) The only difference is the immense amount of Christian themes, symbolism, and allusions---and they'll strike repeatedly throughout the movie. If you enjoyed the milder, weaker version of The Fellowship of the Ring, then you'll enjoy the slightly milder, weaker version of The Two Towers. Otherwise, there isn't anything much added to the table besides characters.P.S. Lesson learned here is that, in order to make a nasty violent film full of more deaths than a fumigation of a contaminated house maintain the ""PG"" rating, there must be religious messages tied underneath it all. Funny how religion and warfare comes hand-in-hand even in fiction.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

76,Scars_Remain,"Good, but Missing Something",7,24 May 2008,"I enjoyed Prince Caspian as an entertaining movie with some very nice visuals but not much more. It was a very well done film with some great scenes of action and intensity but I couldn't help but feel the whole time that it was missing something important. I don't know exactly what it was but for some reason, I couldn't fully engage in the film.I thought the story was pretty good but being a huge fan of the book, I thought it strayed a bit too much. The acting was decent as well, but definitely rough at times. I loved the visuals and most of the effects also. Overall, it's definitely worth a look but I wasn't as crazy about it as I thought I would be.Check this one out if you liked The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe. It's a pretty fun film!",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
77,barrys82,"Very good, better than the first one",8,23 May 2008,"The second movie of The Chronicles of Narnia in my opinion is better than the first one. It is a film that defies the most creative imagination. It is full of action, adventure and the humor is excellent. The CGI are so impressive and the effects astonishing. The cast is practically the same of the first movie except for Sergio Castellito as King Miraz that by the way his performance was a little confusing because at first he seems the worst villain and then he becomes kinda weak. The for kids seems more mature and it notice in their performances. The movie is a little bit too long but it doesn't get tiresome. To conclude, the movie is enjoyable and entertaining, perfect for all ages.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

It wasn't until later I heard that the movie was a box office flop. Be that as it may, it was fairly true to the book with some creative liberties taken. I especially liked the creature and character designs. My friend asked who had played the uncle (the evil human king) and I told her that I didn't know. I later learned that it was an Italian actor whom I had never heard of until that point. Still, it was a decent sequel. It's no Empire Strikes Back or Toy Story 2 but it served its purpose.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
79,cosmic_quest,"Might not be a perfect adaptation but an excellent film, nonetheless",9,26 June 2008,"'The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian' proves that the 'Narnia' series just goes from strength-to-strength as the films progress and it went beyond my rather high expectations and kept me entertained from start to finish.The film is set one year after 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' and we see the Pevensie siblings-- Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy-- are back in London, living ordinary lives as schoolchildren. In Narnia, however, a thousand years have passed and the world there is a much different place. The animals and various magical creatures have been forced into exile by the Telmarines, a human population who dominate over the land. But things change when Prince Caspian, heir to the Telmarine throne, is nearly assassinated by his uncle Lord Miraz, who is intent to kill the boy and seize power for himself and his own son. Escaping into the forests, Caspian blows the horn to bring the Pevensie children back to Narnia and the battle which awaits them...While the actors playing the four Pevensie children are far from Oscar-winning, they are far superior to the mostly wooden efforts of the 'Harry Potter' young cast. William Moseley, as Peter, and Anna Popplewell, as Susan, give a fair effort but it is Skander Keynes, who plays Edmund, and Georgie Henley's Lucy who shine out throughout the film. It will be interesting to see these two both in future 'Narnia' films and in other projects. When it comes to Caspian himself, I have to admit that I was surprised by the casting of Ben Barnes, who is older than William Mosely. The 1980s BBC adaptation of the book had always left me imaging Caspian to be around Lucy's age but, watching the film, I think they were right to cast an adult since it was a role that would have been too physically demanding for a young adolescent, not to mention it would look a tad ridiculous to think people would allow a child to lead them into battle. That said, Barnes might not have been terrible but he was stilted at times and didn't carry the film as well as he could have (although, thankfully, Moseley and Henley stepped in when needed).The film did veer off from the book on many occasions but most of the changes were forgivable (although I was only about eight when I read the novel and it's quite hazy in my mind now!). The battle scenes were depicted with flair, especially the heart-breaking taking of the castle, and the CGI of both these war scenes and of the animals cannot be faulted. And Aslan's return was every bit as breath-taking as it should be. I quite liked seeing the girls playing a larger role in battle. Yes, they didn't in the books and it would be expected of 1940s girls to be more dainty but I think young female fans needed to have someone to relate to and cheer on. It was also a nice touch giving the Telmares an non-English accent, showing they are from a distant world so far away from the Penvensies' native Britain.'Prince Caspian', nevertheless, did have negative points to it. While it was acceptable to age Caspian to his late teens/early twenties, they should have made him more self-aware of his destiny as king instead of retaining the impression that he is a clueless child who isn't even aware of his uncle's dark side. The romance between him and Susan was also unnecessary and clearly was added just to pander to the minority of empty-headed teenagers out there (let them watch 'Hannah Montana' and leave this film to those of us with brains).Overall, though, this was a wonderful film, which nicely followed on from TLWW. It was fittingly darker, reflecting on Narnia becoming a darker place over the milenia that had passed, yet there were moments of humour to lighten the mood at times. There were scenes that might have been too mature for very young children but then, a film of this length isn't suited to toddlers in the first place. 'Prince Caspian' might not be quite on the level of 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy but it gives a very good attempt and does come close at times. I now look forward to 'The Voyage of the Dawn Treader'.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
80,Jacques98,Heartless pulp family entertainment.,2,6 September 2008,"Let me get it strait: I didn't like Prince Caspian as a book, and I really didn't like it as a movie. I enjoyed, even loved some of the other books in the series but this one was just lacking . . . well, story. It felt more like filler between the two more important books in the series than a book of itself. The movie multiplies that feeling by a hundred.The movie either took out or butchered the only scenes from the book that I enjoyed, and that set me off more than anything. The other thing that set me off was the amount of dull space in the movie, filled by bloodless battles that were all ripped off from 300 but, as I just said, made bloodless. To say the battle sequences in the first movie adaption were better shot is an understatement. They should have gone PG-13 with this movie, and I still cannot forgive the director for not doing so.Besides the dull battle scenes, there literally was no story to speak of. I know I personally wasn't offended by the addition of forced romance into the movie, but a lot of people who saw it with me said they were. C.S. Lewis never would have stooped to being so cliché.But I think my single biggest criticism for this movie was that the heart of the books was gone. There was no emotional core; all the characters were flat-line. Though I can criticize the first adaption, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe as much as this film, at least the first understood and kept the emotional tension the book had.Overall, I don't think this was a worthy adaption at all. Even then, the book wasn't as good as the others anyway. However, I'd still like them to try The Voyage of the Dawn Threader, but if they mess that up, I'll never see another one of these movies again.2/10",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

82,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,"The action looks good, but restrained film-making hurts the film and leaves the viewer bored in between the action.",5,16 May 2008,"As a person who generally disagrees with critics on the ""blockbuster"" type of film, I'd have to go ahead and say they got it right this time. In short, Prince Caspian is disappointing, and definitely not worth a three year wait. The problem is in the acting, as all of our main heroes (which now numbers five with the introduction of Caspian himself) outside of two are bad, throwing away the spectacular action scenes and making director Andrew Adamson look even worse than he already does.Prince Caspian has a lot of action going on in it, so I actually had good expectations considering Adamson has already shown before that he is able to develop characters well, as he did in the first Narnia and in the Shrek films. However, he didn't do that in this installment. He focused too much on building the action sequences (which look like child versions of 300 and Lord of the Rings) and forgot to make the audience care about his characters. There's little to no effort in developing Caspian himself, and in the end I still didn't really care about him. And the 4 Pevensie kids aren't as developed as well as before. It's almost like Adamson automatically expects us to love the heroes without any real proof in the film.William Moseley annoyed me as Peter, and Anna Popplewell seemed bored and bland as Susan. I think the only kids in the film that were actually doing a good job were the youngest, Skandar Keynes and Georgie Henley as Edmund and Lucy respectively. Ben Barnes gives far and away...one of the most disappointing performances of all time as Prince Caspian. He sucks, there's no other way to put it. The guy can't show emotion, and he's nearly ruined a great hero. I did not believe for one second that this guy could be a King. As for the adults, Peter Dinklage was definitely my favorite as the dwarf Trumpkin. He's a great actor. The main villain of the film, King Miraz, was played well by Sergio Castellito. His take on the character fit perfectly within the world and his voice added a bit of an intimidation factor to the movie.I found the comparisons to Lord of the Rings to be quite obvious. I won't tell you what they are, as it's kind of fun to point at the screen and go ""Adamson totally didn't think of that himself"", which I found myself doing a few times. The action scenes may be stellar and beautiful visually (Narnia itself is again, beautiful), but the fact that we have a 2 and a half hour movie leaves us a lot of quiet time, during which I almost fell asleep a couple times. While the movie is PG again, it's a very harsh PG. The epic battle sequences are restrained a bit (Adamson really fears the studio executives), but they do manage to show many slashings, stabbings, and even a decapitation that's partially offscreen. However, my biggest problem with the last film was the fact that there was no blood in any of the battle sequences, and Adamson didn't feel the need to put any in Prince Caspian, either...even though there's a scene where one of our heroes full on stabs another character in a place that would cause fatal bleeding, and when they pull the sword out, it gleams as if it was just shined. This is inexcusable restrained film-making.Luckily, Adamson is not the director of the third part of the film series (Dawn Treader will be directed by Michael Apted, the director of ""Enough"" and Bond film ""The World Is Not Enough""), and that's why I'll probably still catch that one. The restrained and lazy film-making of Adamson really hinders the film, but all in all it might be worth a watch. It is still very similar to the first, albeit much darker (over half of the movie takes place at night). Parents, it's probably okay for kids 9 or 10 and up.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

I, who did not read the book(s), was excited to see what they could do to this franchise after watching the 1st one. And it was a decent sequel, but not jaw dropping.Positive is definitely the production, CGI and settings are even better than in the first.Plot is not really better. Story feels dragged out a lot and is somewhat predictable at one point. Was missing more really shocking moments. Also two things reminded me too much of 'Harry Potter' and 'Lord Of The Rings'.As someone who did not read the books - It's a decent Fantasy movie.

84,Rcwilkinson123,Continues to do even more justice for Lewis' series,9,26 May 2008,"It's hard for me to imagine anybody going to see 'The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian' and not be impressed by how well this film series is progressing. While 'The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe' was a good film, quite honestly, 'Prince Caspian' takes the improving Narnia series to an even greater level.Religious symbolism aside, 'Prince Caspian' is in every way better than an already-good 'Lion.' This film simply builds on everything that was established in the first, despite focusing more intensely on, or even creating new, story lines that were either toned down or non-existent in the book. Most of these played-up story lines served to improve the intrigue of the movie- most notably, the longer, more drawn-out battle scenes, just as they did with the battle in 'Lion' (a battle that was just one page long in the book). The only exception to this was the Caspian-Susan romance, a plot point that was perhaps slightly misplaced and pointless. Quite literally, the last half of the film is nearly nonstop action, something that surprised me, but I certainly won't complain about. Also, inviting the scene with the temptation of the White Witch Jadis, and playing up the power struggle between Caspian and Peter was a brilliant move. The portrayers of the Pevensie children did a much better job in their acting. King Miraz's portrayer played the role perfectly, embodying the character to its fullest.'Caspian' indicates that the 'Narnia' series is quickly evolving into perhaps the greatest fantasy film series to date, better than the Harry Potter movies. Keep the same direction under Adamson, and this famous book series will be done justice.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
85,Chalice_Of_Evil,It's not as enjoyable as the first...,7,28 June 2008,"But it's not too shabby either. What this film lacked was the freshness, the lightheartedness and the childlike sense of wonder of the first. Make no mistake, this film isn't just darker in its lighting (night scenes being SO dark sometimes, that you can barely see certain things), but also in its themes. This one ups the intensity, action and violence (where the first film showed not a single drop of blood, there's quite a bit shown this time around) more than a few notches. Don't bother taking young kids to see this. Either they'll be bored and restless throughout or they'll be frightened. For everyone else, though, this movie's mature approach to things may be a welcome change to the more child-friendly atmosphere of the first.The movie starts off in Narnia...but it is a bleak beginning (which kind of sets the tone for the rest of the film). It takes a while to get going, but once we see Lucy, Susan, Peter and Edmund again for the first time, with them comes back a sense of familiarity. Then when they eventually get transported back to Narnia (by means of a train whizzing by), we share their joy and relief at being back in the magical land we all know and love. It is indeed good to be back...but for how long? We are soon informed that Narnia may be a more savage place than we remember - which proves all too true. The land has been taken over by human soldiers known as Telmarines (not Tambourines) and all the magnificent creatures (Narnians) who once populated the land have been greatly depleted in number/have gone into hiding.As far as the four main stars of the film go, not only have they grown up in appearance (Georgie Henley being the most notable), but they have also matured as actors. Where some of their dialogue felt a bit forced in the first movie, it feels natural this time around. The most surprising for me was Skandar Keynes as Edmund. He was far less annoying this time around (and didn't succumb to the same weaknesses he did in the first one). Peter fits the role of leader well (even if he gets into some arguments here and there). Susan shows that she - like the film itself - may have in fact lost some of her wonder and imagination when it comes to Narnia. She, unlike Lucy, doesn't seem to embrace the magical land as home as much as she used to, and this plays into the end of the movie (she kicks major butt with a bow and arrow, though). Georgie Henley - like everything else about the film - has matured quite a bit and lost some of the innocence that made her character so likable originally. All four turn in fine performances.Unfortunately, in the case of all the Narnian creatures who we'd come to know and love in the first film (such as Mr. Tumnus, the Beavers, etc), they're no longer around (on account of 1300 years having past since the children - as adults - left Narnia). It's more than a little saddening to hear that these familiar characters have departed, and you would have expected the children to be more broken up about it. The new characters that are introduced aren't as instantly likable as the ones from the original film, I have to say. I think the one who became likable the quickest would have to be the badger named Trufflehunter. I wasn't particularly fond of the two grumpy dwarfs he hung out with, though. Having heard about a swashbuckling mouse character appearing in this film, I feared we'd be subjected to a cringe-worthy Jar-Jar Binks type, but I can thankfully say that I was pleasantly surprised by how non-annoying Reepicheep was. He's actually pretty ruthless, when it comes to killing soldiers.Of all the new human faces we get to meet, Prince Caspian (who is amiably played by Ben Barnes) is probably the most welcome. The villains, however (like King Miraz and his fellow Telmarine soldiers) are menacing...but at the same time pretty boring. They're certainly no Tilda Swinton (who, regrettably, we get to see all-too-briefly). Someone else who suffers from reduced screen time is Aslan. Despite him saying that things don't happen the same way twice, he still basically comes to save the day again at the end (and I thought he didn't look as meticulously animated as he did in the first film, personally).While the movie does occasionally have bits of humour, they're few and far between. There's one scene involving Peter having to leave behind the Narnians he led into battle, which really illustrates how the movie's themes have matured (and what an utter waste war is). The pacing of the film is erratic at times. Slow to begin with, picks up, slows down, picks up again, then has somewhat of a drawn-out conclusion (and a sombre one at that). It will be interesting to see if the next film suffers (due to the fact that two of our core four won't be returning). I appreciate the fact that this movie took a dark turn and had to up the ante from the first, but in doing so...it lost part of what made the first film so successful: sheer wonder and imagination. Narnia used to be a land that you'd want to escape to (and in doing so, get away from the depressing real world)...but what happens when the real world and Narnia collide, with the harshness of reality bleeding into Narnia (a land that was once such a magical place)?",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
86,galensaysyes,A letdown for children,7,24 May 2008,"I enjoyed this as I watched it (and would have enjoyed it even more if it hadn't been shown with the sound REALLY! LOUD! ALL! THE! WAY! THROUGH!). But after comparing it with the book I was disappointed. It isn't really aimed at young children, and it leaves a mixed aftertaste and unclear message, which suggest the involvement of one too many cooks.Unlike the first film, which stayed more or less the same as the book it started from, this one is partly the book and partly the kinds of ""improvements"" into which filmmakers are easily seduced. Narnia has become Narnywood. Always in adapting a book a lot of things need to be changed for dramatic purposes, but with a children's classic I think the plot should remain as much the same as possible. After seeing film no. 1, I was crossing my fingers that the producers would make good on their promise to film the entire series. After seeing this one, I'm much less keen. Consider how much farther it deviates from its source, and in what direction. It leaves out a good deal of (1) Aslan (which would seem the opposite of what a Narnia film ought to do), (2) lighter fantasy, and (3) lightness generally; and it replaces these with a good deal more (1) fighting and killing, (2) chases, (3) threats, (4) conspiracies, and (5) betrayals--and (6) even a painful childbirth. The sum of the impressions of these is very different from what one takes from the book. If each subsequent film departs farther from the tone of its original by the same degree, by the time no. 7 comes around it won't be much like Lewis at all. It's not that the action scenes in this film are bad. They're exciting in their own right. But there are too many of them, and they go on and on at lengths in excess of the narrative and dramatic points they're making. Indeed, every scene seems to go on and on, even when its content seems to justify its prolongation. I have a feeling the film was self-indulgently edited, and could lose at least a half hour in silences and repetitions. I would expect it rather to try children's patience in places, as it did mine. In addition to its longueurs and its violence, another element that marks it as less a children's film than it should have been is Prince Caspian himself, who is changed from a boy to an adult. (I guess this was done with an eye toward film no. 3, where the book has him older--but still not as old as this.) The Pevensies are too old as well, but this works in the film's favor since, being older, they're practically different actors and show new and interesting aspects. The film has other good things in it, which I'm not giving their due. But really I think that at ground level the filmmakers go in a wrong way, or switch back and forth between right and wrong, and this is difficult for me to excuse when they had both film no. 1 and the book to guide them, plus the BBC's earlier dramatization as a reference point. (However, I realize that in the publicity universe of these films it is as if the BBC series never was.) They're only at no. 2 of the series and have already lost sight of its rightful audience, and of what was at its heart. They've gone Narnywood.Postscript: Watching this again for the first time since its release, and immediately following Lion, Witch and Wardrobe, I could see more clearly how it went astray. Probably LWW will come to be regarded as a classic fantasy, if it isn't so regarded already; and this sequel had every chance to be one too. It certainly has good things in it, like the staging of the battle scenes. But it seems ill-managed, as if the people who had kept the first movie on track weren't around for the second. So it ends up at least half an hour too long, and scenes go on and on past their point, repeating and confusing themselves: even the action scenes, like Peter's duel with the head of the Telmarines. Evidently the concerns of the book, such as Lucy's failure to guide the other kids as Aslan directs, were of little concern to the movie makers, and the elements they substituted, e.g. Peter's rivalry with Caspian, are poorly developed and unsatisfactorily resolved. In the absence of sustained dramatic interest the story comes down to the kids anticipating battle, and then battling. And the moment the audience was most looking forward to, the return to Narnia, is utterly disappointing. Instead of letting us follow the kids in, the movie begins there; then, when the moment of transport arrives, although Lucy says it feels like magic, to the audience it just feels like a computer effect (as is also true of the later ""magical"" sequences); finally, when the kids get over, they're nowhere we know. In LWW the cameraman and the designer took special care with light, color, and whatever else to create a unique Narnian atmosphere. PC looks as though it had changed production people and the new bunch made no effort to duplicate the achievement of the first. So one of the film's big points--that the kids have got back to Narnia, but generations later--is lost: this is not that place. Without it, and without a proper story, what the film communicates mainly is a mood, which it takes from the male characters (Aslan excluded): irritable anxiety alternating with grim resolve. This doesn't set a very happy tone for a children's fantasy. Someone should have been keeping track.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
87,jemps918,Even better than the first!,9,4 June 2008,"Haven't read the books, but saw this anyway because I found The Chronicles of Narnia 1 enjoyable enough. But Prince Caspian grips you from start to finish, with barely a breather! At almost 2 1/2 hours, that's a remarkable feat indeed, especially for a family flick.Of course the story, pacing, acting, cinematography and special effects were superb. Director Andrew Adamson helms the series once more, and if you enjoyed Shrek, you'll see parallelisms in Caspian (i.e. Puss in Boots is now a mouse).But the acting of everyone involved carried this movie through. Ben Barnes (Stardust) was perfectly cast as Prince Caspian. His positively swoon-worthy delivery of the titular doltish but brave young royalty was the perfect dark accompaniment to the mostly sunshiney demeanor lent by the Pevensie children who have slightly grown up. William Moseley continues to be brilliant as King Peter and so is the youngest of the siblings, Georgie Henley, who reprises her role as Lucy and continues to be the scene stealer with her adorable performance despite entering her tweens. Worth noting, too, is Skandar Keynes as the family's black sheep from the first installment of the Narnia series, Edmund. Despite lesser exposure here than in the last movie, he shows maturity as he grows into a more dependable character in Part Two. Anna Popplewell plays the ever sensible but fearless Susan and has a beauty that isn't obvious; she grows on you. She is consistently expressive, wonderful to watch (and is so darn lucky having kissed Ben Barnes!).Even the supporting cast, animated and otherwise, contributed their own brand of funnies, scaries and heartwarming fuzzies. Overall, a wonderfully made, entertaining flick! P.S. No after-credits scene here, but stay put to listen to the funky closing track ""The Call"" by Regina Spektor.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
88,kyle-cruse,"Decently good, though somewhat inferior to the first",8,16 September 2008,"""Prince Caspian"" is truly a great story and spiritual allegory, as was its predecessor. Unlike the first film, I was not familiar with the novel which this movie is based on. However, that did not stop me from enjoying this film and catching many of the allegorical references to my Christian faith. I simply loved the references to faith and trusting what we cannot see, and Aslan's plea that the kids should come and see him despite the fact that others would laugh or think they are crazy. It's the perfect allegory of coming to Jesus despite what others would think and say. That said, I still did not find this film as enjoyable or well-made as the first great film. While the allegorical elements are done well, non-Christians will not necessarily pick up on them, as these facts are not as well-known as those in the first movie, which tells the main story of Christ and his sacrifice. As far as acting goes, the four kids prove to be even better actors here than they did in the first film. The special effects here are not as good, however, as the images, particularly those of Aslan, are obviously computer-generated and fairly unrealistic. What really ruins this film from being perfect, however, is the lame attempts at humor made by the animal characters in this film. These jokes make me want to groan, and they destroy the entertainment aspect of this movie.Parents may want to take note of one thing. A line in the film says it well: ""You may find Narnia a more savage place than you remember."" This film seems far more brutal and violent to me than the first one. The long battle sequences and sword fights prove this. Though it is a great spiritual allegory for them, you may want to make sure your kids can handle the action violence in the film before you take them to see it. All this said, it is still an enjoyable film, worth seeing, and you'll get a great spiritual message from the story.*** out of ****",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
89,mr_popcorn,"McCheesy's take on ""The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian""",8,7 June 2008,"The Pevensie siblings return once again to the magical land of Narnia after a year only to find out that what was a year to them was 1300 years to Narnia. Now, Prince Caspian, the rightful heir to the throne has been overthrown by his conniving uncle Miraz so that his child will be the next ruler of the land. Prince Caspian then enlists the help of the last bastion of Narnians left as well as the Pevensie siblings and retake Narnia or die trying.The second installment to the Narnia saga is undoubtedly a much darker one. There's more violence, more blood, the siblings actually killed somebody and theme overall is grittier and dark compared to the first film. The CG was also a lot better than the first one and the times the CG effects was used was multiplied by a hundred. From that musketeer Mouse to River Jesus, everything is so beautiful to look at. The acting has also improved and it seems that the four lead actors have gotten used to their characters and they didn't have a hard time adapting the character's personality as their own. New members of the cast are more than welcome, Ben Barnes as the titular character (who is by the way as gay as he'll ever be, what a lame-o gay Prince), Peter Dinklage as dwarf Trumpkin and a mouse ala musketeer Reepicheep (voiced by Eddie Izzard) whose purpose in the film is to make the audience laugh and as a ""cutesy"" poster animal for the film.The action sequences will remind you of Lord of the Rings and it will keep audiences on the edge of their seats down to the very last minute. The film very much stayed true to the book but tweaked some little tiddly parts to make it more grander and in epic proportions. The Night Raid sequence wasn't really explored much in the book but director Andrew Adamson felt like he had to tell it to the audience for it will make an awesome battle sequence and the idea of mythical creatures storming a medieval castle has not been done before. Well, he was correct. That part was one of my favorite scenes in the film. Although, the scene that stood out the most to me is the ending battle scene. River Jesus is such a visual spectacle I was literally gasping for air like those poor Telmarines. I do not deserve to be in the presence of such a powerful entity. You rock River Jesus. The White Witch scene is an additional treat. What would happen if Prince Caspian shook hands with her? Probably the end of the world er, Narnia.""Prince Caspian"" is definitely a lot better than its predecessor and here's hoping for a better and darker Narnia 3. 8/10",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
90,haterofcrap,Good sequel,9,12 September 2010,"The Chronicles of Narnia were good movies for children. I usually hate films about children or about stupid animals, but this film was okay. ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" are very good films because they teach many important things to the children about faith and God, and I found that to be pretty good. Even when this film is not as good as ""The Passion of The Christ"", it is still a pretty good film, with many Christian values, and that's why it deserves appreciation and recognition. The effects and the performances were good too. This film is appropriate for the family viewing.This sequel was slightly more violent than the first film, but it still was a good film for the whole family. Also, the actor who plays Prince Caspian was very attractive and talented. That's why this film was so good.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
91,lotus_chief,Just as good...maybe better than the first,8,16 February 2009,"I can't quite remember how I came about watching 'The Lion, The Witch & The Wardrobe' (especially since I had never heard of the book), but I loved it. I'm not usually into fantasy films, but I thought it was very well done. When I saw the poster for 'Prince Caspian' when it first came out in theaters, I was actually psyched...especially because of the darker tone that was suggested by it, and was really looking forward to it. I was not disappointed. Reminiscent of Lord of the Rings (but MUCH more tolerable), this was straight entertainment from start to finish. The darker tone, although expected, was still a bit of a shock, because of how this tone was maintained throughout the film. The special effects were marvelous, the story was more than adequate and it all made for a sequel right up to par with the first. The 'Prince Caspian' character was a welcomed sight; all the actors played their roles pretty well...especially the smallest one, she's excellent. I would've loved to see more of Aslan, because he really made the first film for me, but that's just my personal opinion. Those people looking for blood every time a sword was used could get more than enough watching 'The Devil's Rejects', besides I do see Disney's name attached to this....it's really not that serious, and it took nothing away from the film. As I understand it, there are even more stories contained in the book; and I could honestly say that if more installments are to be made, I will definitely look forward to seeing them. So far, they're 2 for 2. With regard to the accuracy of the film as compared to the book, I can't speak to that, having never read the book; and maybe that has something to do with my opinion of 'Prince Caspian'. Nevertheless, for what it's worth, I really enjoyed what I saw.*** 1/2 out of **** stars",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
92,honorhorror,Great balance achieved between an epic and a fairy tale.,9,29 May 2008,"The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian is a great production for all the ages absolutely. The movie is shot in a more ""LOR"" style and surpassed the first one in a devastating degree.Although the first Narnia is good for children and family, it is very slow paced and there is very little exciting moments as in the second movie. Prince Caspian is well paced as an Adventure/Epic movie just like LOR:TTT. The special effects are awesome if you compare it with the cheesy Indianna Jones IV. I especially loved the scene of duel between Peter and king Miraz. It's very professionally shot and has a dramatic climax. Unlike any fairy tale movies, Prince Caspian is entirely driven by the battles, that's one of the reasons that it's better paced than the first one. Plus, Tilda Swinton's part is still good. The parts with the mouses knights were really cute, but you can sense it's intentionally added up as a fairy tale element. However it never destroy the atmosphere of the movie.Prince Caspian, just like the early Narnia, has many biblical references. In the first part of the movie, we can see the dark sides of the human beings, which is a theme of ""lost grace"". Later in the movie, we learned from Aslan that faith is important, as Aslan taught Lucy. The theme song in the ending of the film is also amazing, I just kept thinking about the film for nights after seeing it. It meant to leave something to the audiences rather than entertain them only, not like Indy, which already beat the film in the market...I sincerely hope it will achieve a better box office record, which will contribute to the 3rd Narnia film but not delay it or cancel it.Also I would recommend this film to everyone who is sensitive about a movie's art set. I bet that it will win an Oscar for Art-decoration direction.9/10",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

The transposition of the four children takes place as the balance of Narnia changes after several hundred years has passed in the Magical world of Narnia. The cheesecake Prince Caspian has fled the royal castle after an attempt by the evil Spanish like King Minaz has usurped power and is intending to unleashing the evil white witch to help him defeat the forces of Aslan.New Zealand Director Andrew Adamson masterfully and skillfully produces a beautiful children's fairytale myth with a very well paced film and great performances from all the actors. Adamson should have directed the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy as he choice of art direction and casting is magnificent. His visceral vision of the animal world results in endearing and lovable creatures like gallant mouse Reepicheep and comrades.The children in the audience were totally captivated by the film that exhibits the exact right balance of humor and conflict for their innocent minds.A cute mythological tale full of love and heroism as the cute and good forces triumph over the evil greedy ones.The cinematography, vivid colours and production values are far superior to LORD OF THE RINGS and I believe that Andrew Adamson and the Disney team have produced and enduring classic.Like the first Narnia film I am giving five stars and I strongly recommend family viewing.You must catch this film on the big screen while its still showing.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
95,morganstephens512,Alright,5,19 September 2017,"This movie was okay. I read the book recently and I wonder now how could you make a 150 minute movie out of a book that feels like it's no more than 220 pages. I don't know but for movie reviews I try not to compare books to the films unless if a change really makes me mad. Anyways, so the movie takes place one year after the previous film does with the same main four people going to Narnia. Sounds basic enough which is good. I remember there being a lot of fighting for parts of the back story of the events of Caspian. Prince Caspian was a decent character in this movie played by a decent actor. Nothing more than that but also nothing less than that. There was also this love story between Susan (the older girl of the four kids) and Caspian but at the end she didn't want to be with him anymore. The most sad part of the movie to me was when Peter and Susan, the two oldest, found out that they were two old to even go back to Narnia anymore while Lucy and Edmund, the two youngest, still could. Like I said, this movie was decent. Throughout it felt like a average movie that wasn't either edging towards terrible or great. Just sort of in between. Which I find to be nice. How it seemed in the middle of the road.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
96,RCWjr,A very different film from the first one......,7,18 May 2008,"I know, a vague way to title a review. But it is the first thing that comes to mind when I think back on Prince Caspian. This time around the whimsy of the first film is replaced with anger and betrayal. It is a much darker film than the first. For those who have not read the books, this will come as a surprise. If you go in expecting the wonder of the first, you will not find it.Overall, a good film. I thought that it dragged a bit in the middle act, but all in all, it is a much darker and more mature film than the first. For those who say the Christian themes are almost non-existent are very much mistaken. Just because Aslan is not a featured player (doesn't show up until toward the end of the 3rd act), the central themes of Christian faith are even more evident this time around. I have a feeling many of the print reviewers who made these claims are not Christian, or need to go back to Sunday school and brush up. There are many references to seeking Alsan (Christ), to see him you must be looking for him, at one point Lucy is the only one that is able to see him, which is further strengthen when it is insinuated that believing without seeing is true faith, very much a Christian theme.All of the kids have really grown up. By far, Susan makes the biggest leap as a character this go around. She is involved with a lot more of the battle. There is a lot of blood shed this time around and she racks up her share of the body count. Prince Caspian and Peter have much more of an Alpha-male competition than in the book, but it plays out naturally in the context of the movie as one would expect.The new supporting characters this time are mostly used for comedic moments. There were more ""real"" characters used this time, which I think added to the loss of some of the whimsy, but I think this has to be expected. The kids are not the same as they were in the first film. They have been through a battle and become adults, only to be children again. Their innocence is lost, so much of the fantastical of the first naturally should be played down this go around. The central villain is not as threatening as the White Witch, Tilda is a hard act to follow, but this time the central villain wasn't a person, but more so inner demons, which again plays more into the darker themes presented in the film.Looking forward to the next film.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
97,barbagvido,"Watch it, you won't regret it",10,30 November 2015,"I am fan of the book series, but I consider The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe and Prince Caspian kinda overrated. Not like I hate them, but I wish I liked them more. The first movie was in my opinion a great adaptation and much more epic than the book. It's the same with this one, but even better! Child actors are even better in this one and more confident and it's pretty clear. One actor I really liked here is Peter Dinklage, now better known as Tyrion from Game of Thrones, who is amazing as always. The effects are pretty good too, and while it's not as magical as in the first one, it's epic as hell! Story is expanded here and is much bigger than it was in the book (in the book most of it happens in, like, 2 days) and characters are a lot more developed. Also, I loved the Tilda Swinton cameo and it was one of the best scenes. I should probably stop here because this review is a little bit boring because I don't really have much to say but praise. All in all, just watch, you will at least have fun, that's guaranteed.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
98,liberalgems,The Dumbing Down of Narnia! C. S. Lewis Would Be Spinning In His Grave!,1,17 May 2008,"I now understand why so many great writers will never, or only under the rarest of circumstances, allow their stories to be turned into movies while they are still alive! There's no excuse for this horrible adaptation! - ""The Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe"" was a masterpiece, so having the genius to make a C. S. Lewis story into a great film was not an issue. Nor was money! Hollywood made a lot of cash from it's first venture into Narnia! And finding four child & teen actors with fine acting talent to play the lead roles was a smash success. So why such a violent and unimaginative Prince Caspian? One can only speculate. The screenplay, acting and passion are so lacking this time around that I truly wish this story never made it to the Big Screen! I feel this disaster of a film will even damage the Narnia ""brand."" Since making money seems to be Hollywood's only motivation in making this film, they should know better! Prince Caspian was all about fighting and killing, and more killing and more fighting. One scene shows the slaughtering of retreating Narnians and even the deliberately killing of one's own soldiers in the process. If you want to see real evil in a dumbed down fashion, you'll see plenty in this film! NOR IS THIS FILM APPROPRIATE FOR YOUNG CHILDREN! There's certainly nothing cute or delightful about Prince Caspian! Even Aslem was portrayed as a capricious deity, who didn't lift a paw until a child had to risk her life in order to get his attention. Meanwhile, Narians are being crushed to death by flying boulders while Aslem leisurely has a chat with her about old times. This screenplay must have been written by an Atheist or someone with a very dark sense of humor!I frequently write reviews on films I have strong feelings about. I like to encourage people to see a good film and discourage them from seeing a bad one. Let's face it, we have so many entertainment choices. But another reason I write reviews is to congratulate Hollywood for a job well-done, or like in this case, when a film is an unmitigated disaster, I hope to affect their bottom line. Because Hollywood is always confronted with two broad choice: To treat a story as art - with respect, passion and genius like in ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, or do the opposite and treat it like a commodity, which has the feeling of a product made on an factory assembly line!Memo to Hollywood: If you venture in Narnia again fire the current crew and bring in some fresh talent! I challenge you to make your next film one that will stand the test of time!",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
99,jburtroald95,"Superbly done, infinitely better than the grotesquely pathetic first film.",8,1 March 2009,"Much unlike its tasteless, appalling yawn of a predecessor 'The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe' (2005) Walt Disney Pictures and Walden Media's adaptation of the fourth book in C. S. Lewis' classic 'Chronicles of Narnia' series is an extraordinary achievement that grabs your attention from the very first frame.The adventure kicks off 1300 years after the Golden Age of the magical land in which our story takes place. In that time the terrible Talmarine tribe has invaded and conquered the land, slaying thousands of innocent magical creatures and forcing the few survivors into hiding. The Narnians only hope of regaining their freedom is the rightful heir to the throne, the young and noble Prince Caspian (a passionately heroic Ben Barnes.) So he is joined by the four Pevensie children, (William Mosely, Skandar Keynes, Anna Popplewell, and a superior Georgie Henley) the ""great"" lion Aslan (voiced reasonably well by Liam Neeson, but it is not enough to make up for the second-rate animation) and a marvellous array of new characters including the mighty dwarf Trumpkin, (a superb Peter Dinklage) the untrustworthy Black dwarf Nikabrik, (a perfectly sinister Warwick Davis) and a feisty little mouse named Reepicheep, (delightfully voiced by Eddie Izzard) in a seemingly hopeless effort to overthrow Caspian's villainous uncle King Miraz (a stunningly wicked Sergio Castellitto) and give the throne to Caspian so he can make a difference.It is clear that the film's frivolous director Andrew Adamson's plan for the series was only to use it to create a saga of depthless action blockbusters. The first trial saw a rich, warm fantasy masterpiece become ripped to shreds in front of our very eyes. But in this situation the idea is more plausible. His vision of the much-loved novel is similar to that of Disney's 2007 mid-year release 'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End' with younger heroes and a stronger fantasy theme. Most of its brilliance is thanks to the new recruits that prevent Adamson from again getting too carried away with the spectacle and forgetting the characters and storyline. Though unfortunately the film is poisoned by the unneeded presence of some of the old actors - worst of all the maladroit Tilda Swinton with her pathetic attempt at the White Witch  but with the breathtaking performances of the new actors you'll hardly mind even her.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

And then he has the chutzpah to chastise HER for taking so long to find him! Like I said, I was 100% turned off of everything Narnia.But, as I'm sure you have inferred, I've never actually read the books, and a lot of people have taken the trouble here to point out exactly how badly this movie violates the book.

102,fearfulofspiders,"More Entertaining Than Its Predecessor, Though Not Nearly as Engaging or ""New""...",6,15 September 2008,"I thought The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe was a very good film, tough full of character flaws, and a few gripes about the music, it was all-together an enjoyable experience. Prince Caspian, however, was far more entertaining, though not nearly as engaging. As with the acting in the first, all the roles were chosen very nicely, yet character development is sparse, the action is far more broad than the first, and once again the music is less than impressive.Andrew Adamson, returning as director, is and was a fine choice to helm the film, yet his incorporation of slow motion felt overwhelming, similar to the experience I had in 300, where there's just too much of it (i.e. the scene where Susan yells for everyone to brace themselves was pretty corny). The writing is pretty good, yet the story seems to revolve more around the giant battle sequences, rather than focusing on Caspian reclaiming the throne. I haven't read Prince Caspian, so I don't know who to fault: Lewis or Adamson. The ending is incredibly rushed, and did not have any profound affect on me, only hoping there's a combination of what worked in this and the previous film incorporated into The Voyage of the Dawn-Treader. There's also a few confusing parts that warrant this movie to be played with subtitles... just so that there's a better understanding.Now, I'm well aware that Tolkien and Lewis were dear friends and that there's underlying connections between The Chronicles of Narnia and The Lord of the Rings (and The Hobbit and The Silmarillion), but some of these connections are so plainly obvious, that the omission of them would've provided a better sense of originality from the filmmakers (for example, the trees helping the Narnians win the battle, and when the army is swallowed by the river).The acting, just like the first, is quite well done. Everyone does a fine job, and Ben Barnes' choice of using a Spanish accent (inspired by Mandy Patinkin's in The Princess Bride) was a good idea in my opinion -- seeing how the Telmarines had a LOT of Spanish/Mediterranean influence on their appearance. There seems to have been a huge rush job on the writers' part to include as many pausing moments between Susan and Caspian -- and to be all honest, I would've preferred some intimate scenes to actually show that these characters liked each other, rather than seeing minotaurs get bludgeoned. Eddie Izzard is a bit disappointing as Reepicheep (who reminded me of Puss-In-Boots every time he appeared on screen) and Sergio Castellitto as King Miraz was actually quite good.Down to the special effects: they're slightly sub-par compared to The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. The armies are only realistic here and there, but the river scene reminds me of the scene in The Mummy Returns, and Aslan seems incomplete in detail. The vast armies, as mentioned earlier can thank the cinematography for some pretty cool scenes.The music by Harry Gregson-Williams is terrible. There's hardly anything new or original about this ""score"". Mainly, to sum up the music, imagine the first film's score, only tweaked a bit to sound more intense. Not only is there nothing new, there is absolutely NO COMPLEXITY whatsoever. This is just one redundant piece of ""work"" I cannot advise or recommend anyone buying.All in all, while definitely losing focus on the story's intentions, and with some awful music, Prince Caspian is far more visually-entertaining than the first. With good performances, adequate special effects, and lots of eye-candy, I'm sure the family will enjoy this, as there is minimal bloodshed, no vulgarities, and no sensuality. I highly doubt this will earn even the simplest of the Academy Award categories, as there's really nothing impressive, especially after some of the films that have come out in recent months after this film's release. I recommend this for a family looking for something to watch on a weekend night.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
103,blackburnj-1,"An improvement, but still disappointing",5,6 July 2008,"First things first: I should probably say where I'm coming from. I'm not a fan of the first film, ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"". I think it is a poor adaptation which fails to capture the magic of the book and, despite the hundreds of millions of dollars that were poured into it, the film is nowhere near as good as the far cheaper BBC TV adaptations from the late eighties. So my expectations of the second instalment, ""Prince Caspian"", were not high even though the trailer promised a great spectacle.So, the first thing to say about ""Prince Caspian"" itself is that it is an improvement on the first film. There is far more magic to this film (summed up in a wonderful dream sequence), although it still doesn't compare to the books, or even the BBC TV versions. But, because of that, it remains a disappointment to the legions of older fans that read the books as children and fell in love with them. However, this film's prime audience is the children of today, and I can say that all of the kids at my screening enjoyed it.But there are a number of problems. Firstly, Andrew Adamson and his co-screenwriters have taken a book which is good for ninety to a hundred minutes and stretched it into a one-hundred and forty-seven minute juggernaut. The result of this is that the film is far too long and a number of plot lines are brought in which don't really work, the prime example being the ""romance"" between Caspian and Susan which completely jars with the rest of the film.Secondly, some of the acting remains fairly wooden. Georgie Henley's Lucy is as charming and successful as she was in the first instalment, but William Moseley, as Peter, is wooden and he very often lets scenes down. However, Ben Barnes, as Caspian, is very good. He has a certain degree of charisma and has a good deal of talent. Also, our villain, Miraz, played by Sergio Castellitto is excellent. Otherwise, Peter Dinklage is excellent as the dwarf Trumpkin whilst Eddie Izzard voices Reepicheep with gusto.Meanwhile, the writing is shabby at times. Some of the dialogue is just awful and, despite efforts to bring character depth to some of our leads (Caspian, naturally, gets a lot of time given to him), many characters remain undeveloped, poorly thought out and lacking.So it's a mixed bag overall. Some sequences are very well done (e.g. the build up to the castle siege), whilst others are confusing (e.g. the actual castle siege). This trend is continued in the technical areas. Some of the visual effects are stunning, but Aslan still doesn't work. The design, the costumes and the make-up are brilliant but Harry Gregson-Williams' music is so loud and, at many points, overblown that it feels like it is trying to kill people with full orchestral barrages and choral booming. This reaches its nadir with a spectacularly misjudged song over a spectacularly misjudged last five minutes.One of the other problems that this film has (unfair though it is) is that it isn't ""The Lord of the Rings"". Comparison is inevitable, brought on even more by a number of visual references to that trilogy, and, when the two are stood next to each other, ""Narnia"" falls into insignificance. Every few years each growing generation should have its great cinematic experience. For mine it was ""The Lord of the Rings"", for others it was ""Toy Story"" and there are many others. But this series of films is not it and it's disappointing, because these films had so much promise, but they still don't quite deliver.This is not a terrible film, but it isn't a terribly good one either and, despite being too long, children seem to enjoy it. It delivers moments of great spectacle, but it remains a disappointment and proves once again that money can't buy you magic.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
104,Monotreme02,Outstandingly skillful application of creative craftwork: not as good as its predecessor,7,15 June 2008,"The Lord of the Rings trilogy, aside from being an unprecedented and substantial milestone in modern cinematic history, has also managed to single-handedly neutralize the epic fantasy genre. Every fantasy film post-Rings trilogy will now be unavoidably compared to the epic trilogy, which raised the bar so high it is inevitable that every subsequent fantasy epic film released will be considered inferior. And with C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien's close relationship leading to them influencing one another's work, the similarities between the two literary classics are even more inescapable. The fact of the matter is, though, that the two separate film franchises should be considered separately, and once that separation is made one will see that the Chronicles of Narnia franchise fares pretty well on its own.First and foremost, the film exists as an outstandingly skillful application of creative craftwork. A multi-million-dollar budget can buy a lot when it comes to production value, and the film absolutely excels in all aspects of that field. Along with the science fiction genre and perhaps more so, the fantasy genre provides even more of an empty canvas than period films and truly opens up all of the possible creative doors when it comes to production design. The best production design company money can afford these days is probably Weta Workshops, who also brought Middle Earth to life a few years back. As with their work on The Lord of the Rings trilogy, in this film Weta provided costumes, weapons, props, and sets with such incredible attention to detail, each prop specifically tailored for each race and group giving each one of them a history, telling a story.Story-wise the film also excels; it's very old-fashioned and rooted in tradition, utilizing such classic literary fantasy devices such as the evil uncle, the banished prince, and eventually the oppressed underdogs eventually overthrowing their oppressors. It's interesting to see C.S. Lewis' religious allegories come through, manifested by Aslan testing the Narnian's faith in him. That said, the film's screenplay isn't perfect and is lacking in many portions, including characterization, choppy dialogue and a pretty drawn-out build-up until the action sequences begin at the end of the second half. It is in these scenes though that the movie truly comes to life: It features two major action sequences and both are crafted and executed exceedingly well, filled with excitement, nail-biting tension and plenty of emotional, magical moments.Although I resent the comparisons between this franchise and the Lord of the Rings trilogy, it is inevitable that each subsequent film will be compared with its predecessor. In this case, I couldn't help but feel that Prince Caspian lacked much of what made The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe so enjoyable: The sense of magic and discovery, the strong characterizations (especially of the white witch, to the credit of the majestic Tilda Swinton)  even the climactic battle which sealed up the first film was far grander than that in this sequel. Still, the series has a promising future and I eagerly anticipate the next installment, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, scheduled for 2010.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

106,C-Younkin,Better than first Narnia movie,7,16 May 2008,"""The Chronicles of Narnia"" has gorgeous looking set-design and visuals, a really good cast, and stories that teach a good moral lesson. But one thing keeps me from really raving about the series so far, which is it is not ""Harry Potter."" When I watched the first one something just seemed missing. Maybe it was originality, maybe the kid actors just didn't charm me in the same way and maybe it was the promise of dealing with weightier subjects still to come, but my inner jury is still out on whether this series has a chance to touch epic greatness or not. I went into ""Prince Caspian"" hoping for a clearer picture and what I got was something far less than ""Potter"" and ""Rings"", and yet still something entertaining and fun. As I remember it, the Pevensie children, Lucy (Georgia Henley), Edmund (Skander Keynes), Peter (William Moseley), and Susan (Anna Popplewell) were crowned Kings and Queens of Narnia after helping Jesus (actually Aslan) the Lion defeat the white witch. It is now one year later and the kids find themselves back in Narnia, where they are surprised to discover that Narnia is now 1300 years older and the years have not helped it age well. Narnia has been conquered by the Telmarines and is now under the control of the evil King Miraz (Sergio Castellitto). The King's nephew, Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes), has called the children back to Narnia to help him take back the throne and establish himself as its rightful heir. Miraz has forced Caspian into hiding and vowed to kill him so that he can put his son on the throne next. With the help of a kindly dwarf, Trumpkin (Peter Dinklage), and many other Narnian creatures, the kids and Caspian set out to find Aslan (Liam Neeson) and put an end to Miraz's reign on Narnia. The screenplay, by Andrew Adamson, Christopher Markus, and Stephen McFeely begins slowly with its plot setup but it doesn't take long before ""Narnia"" turns into Lord of the Rings-lite. This is a much more brutal ""Narnia"" movie, staging two absolutely epic and rousing battles (one an invasion on Miraz castle and the other being Narnia's final stand against Miraz) that will thrill both young and old. I love an excellently choreographed sword-fight and this movie doesn't disappoint in that category either. There's no blood but for a children's film, the action is first-rate and non-stop excitement. The visual effects and make-up design on the Narnian creatures are a marvel to behold and the music by Harry Gregson-Williams adds to the movies epic feel. ""Narnia"" also offers a bit of compelling religious symbolism, specifically referring to such topics as believing in a higher power and temptation. ""Prince Caspian"" does have its problems, primarily coming from the four leads. While these kids are likable in and of themselves, you never really see them as having individual personalities. They're noble and brave and the actors play the roles well but they're also pretty bland and the movie is at its weakest when they're talking to one another. Peter Dinklage, on the other hand, is a nice addition to the cast and adds some comic relief, and the ladies are going to love the charming Ben Barnes. Castellitto's glowering Miraz makes for a decent villain and if you were going to give a voice to Jesus, who's better to do it than the hearty and authoritative Liam Neeson. One other problem was ""Caspian"" seems to steal several ideas from ""Lord of the Rings"" (Walking trees anyone) and at times that can be distracting but overall this is a kids movie that will excite adults as well. The battles, the effects, and almost all of it makes for good family entertainment and after last week's terrible ""Speed Racer"", they could use some. Enjoy!",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
107,commandercool88,"Solid sequel, but still lifeless.",7,7 July 2008,"C.S. Lewis created some of the most memorable fantasy stories when he penned his 'Chronicles of Narnia' series more than fifty years ago. An incredibly imaginative man who could sweep readers away to an enchanted world with the stroke of his pen. It's difficult to say the films based on his work have been met with the same success. With 'The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe', moviegoers were introduced to a visually breathtaking but ultimately underwhelming adaptation. With weaker source material this time around, 'Prince Caspian' offers much of the same but achieves a pleasantly surprising tone.Even now, there are many times when 'Chronicles of Narnia' still feels like the awkward younger brother of 'Lord of the Rings' and 'Harry Potter'. In its attempt to appeal to an ultra-family friendly base, 'Narnia' continues to feel bland in nature and surprisingly void of the heart and soul that made the books much more magical and epic. Andrew Adamson's direction still lacks inspiration, and a diluted script remains disappointing. The magic simply isn't there. Technically, 'Prince Caspian' is a good film. The visuals are captive and the production values are all exceptional, but 'Caspian' doesn't soar the way it should, and it leaves you wanting more.The young cast is growing up, and for the most part this is reflected in their performances. Anna Popplewell and Skander Keynes as Susan and Edmund Pevensie continue to be the strongest bunch, while Georgie Henley has matured greatly in her role as the youngest Pevensie, Lucy. It's William Moseley as Peter, the eldest child, who once again is painfully stiff and awkward. For who is supposed to be the valiant leader of these films, this is certainly problematic. Ben Barnes, who portrays the film's title character, is equally dry and fails to create a character worthy enough for a film to be based on. It is the great Peter Dinklage ('Elf', 'Nip/Tuck', 'The Station Agent') and Eddie Izzard who turn in solid performances as Trumpkin the dwarf and the voice of Reepicheep the mouse, respectively. Both offer much-needed comic relief and sparks of life in this at times dense project.If there is one promising note that can be taken away from 'Prince Caspian' that couldn't be said for its predecessor is the film's handling of the obligatory climactic battle sequence. Whereas 'The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe' withdrew its punch in a shockingly weak and tame fashion, 'Caspian' pushes its PG-rating in order to craft a more menacing tone that includes quite a heavy emphasis on death. It's darker, and the picture features a number of exciting and thrilling action sequences, amounting to an entertaining climax that features an array of woodlen creatures, giant birds, fighting trees, and a mammoth water creature that seems to carry a Biblical undertone.For better or worse, 'Prince Caspian' finds Narnia at a very different place in its history, where one year in our world is 1,300 years in Narnia. Aslan is no longer a major player here, and the White Witch makes a brief but memorable appearance. This young franchise has two very different films under its belt, both with their strong suits and blaring weaknesses. I can't say I'm a big fan of these pictures, as I still rather indifferent towards them. But I came out of 'Prince Caspian' pleasantly surprised. A strong third act lifts this film in good favor, and I'll probably come back for more. All this franchise needs now is a breath of life.More reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

109,sngbrd39,Does an adaptation have to be faithful to be good?,8,26 May 2008,"When I started to see the ads for this film, it confused and concerned me that Jadis, the White Witch, was making an appearance. I remember thinking, ""Oh, my goodness, they're going to mess with the book, aren't they?"" Having now seen Prince Caspian, I can say that yes, they did certainly change the book, but some of the changes really do work in this adaptation.Prince Caspian was written as the second book in C.S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia series. (It's the third book if you're using the chronological order of the stories.) It is the story of Caspian, prince of the Telmarines, who must escape from, and later defeat, his evil uncle Miraz to gain his rightful throne over both Telmar and Narnia. He is helped by the Pevensie children, who have once again been brought from our world into the world of Narnia to help set everything right; a group of exiled Narnians whom the Telmarines have, in the past, attempted to exterminate; and Aslan, the Lion who ultimately rules the Narnian lands, though his presence is not always known.As a film adaptation, Caspian is not nearly as faithful to the original book as The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe was. Several liberties are taken with the order of the story, as well as expanding the battle sequences, adding a minor romantic subplot, and the previously-mentioned appearance of Jadis. Some of these changes work better than others. I honestly wish there had not been an attempt to inject romance into this story; it is not at all in the spirit of Lewis' writings, especially in the Narnia stories, to attempt puppy love. Other changes, such as the appearance of Jadis, are much more effective and really add to the story as the film tells it. The battle scenes are truly stunning, even more so than those in the previous film.Despite the license taken with the story, Prince Caspian is a very good film; I would almost say that it is a better film than Wardrobe. If you are a fan of the book series, as I am, it is best to think of this as a separate entity from the book; that is probably how it would be best enjoyed.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
110,the-gossip-king,Pathetic follow up to the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe,3,5 April 2008,"I caught this while on holidays but I won't give any extra details for obvious reasons.This will most likely go down as one of the most disappointing fantasty films of all time. I think Lord of the Rings is going to always be the best and hoped Narnia would at least come close but Prince Caspian has really dropped the Chronicles of Narnia. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was great but not groundbreaking. To be fair this movie was based on what I think was one of the worst books in the series. It was good but not as good as any of the others. Books can be expanded but not in a way which makes it completely boring. The action is dull and not interesting even though there's more of it but the visuals have improved. I liked the kids in the first movie but now they are already on my nerves especially the actor portraying Peter who came off as a snobby, insufferable bully. I hope that when Harry Potter ends the Chronicles of Narnia will be there to pick up all the fans but they need to radically improve. At least Michael Apted is doing the next one. Need IMPROVEMENT!",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
111,kneiss1,A tad better than the first part,6,25 August 2010,"This is quite unusual! - The sequel is better than the first part! - At least in my opinion. This movie was no longer as overloaded, and did no longer feel like a big box of way too sweet candy. It had a pretty good atmosphere, and a few really nice characters. Not to forget the great action scenes. Pretty much everything I disliked in the first part, improved in the second part. Everything felt a bit ""deeper"". The Story and the Characters are more convincing than they have been in the first part.Yet... the story, nor the characters convinced me. A lot still seemed ""open"", unexplained and not fully drawn. The story and some scenes have been illogical in several ways. Too bad, this could have been a really great movie without all this disturbing flaws that throw you out of the fantasy world every time.I heard that the books are great. But after seeing the movies, either the books have to suck, or the movies sullied the books in a seriously disgusting way. I have been debating with myself a lot if I should rate this movie with 5, or 6 points. I now rated it with 6 points. First, because it's better than the first part. Second, because I had a lot of fun watching.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
112,sinncross,"Better, but not much so...",6,31 May 2008,"A year of leaving Narnia, Peter (William Mosley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skander Keynes) and Lucy (Georgie Henley) strangely return, only to find Narnia has advanced 1300 years in their absence. They have entered a world which has drastically changed since their last visit where the Narnians appear virtually extinct. They come across Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes), a man who, with the aid of the Narnians, is fighting to have his rightful place as heir to the throne of Cair Paravel returned.The story of Prince Caspian is a very on-off affair. It is a fairly simple story to follow and while clearly an adaption of the novel, it does not discard the central thematic of Christian theology on which the novel is based. The story sports some great moral lessons on such concepts as deliverance, and the importance of maturity in respect to one's age. The film also does an amazing job in diverging into the mythology of Narnia by evoking the very history and culture of its inhabitants. This proves to enhance the interaction with the film, but does not stop it from having some very unfortunate mishaps. Firstly, for a film which passes the two-hour mark, Prince Caspian feels quite short on story material, in fact I would go as far as saying that the film could have been done, story wise, in just about hour. Secondly, while Narnia has changed, the world in which the story takes place, feels far too generic. This is because the story never really plays on the whole 'Narnia has changed' concept. It has lost its magical elements of the first film, but there is nothing in its place to help fill the void. These problems all stem to the amount of action sequences in the film.The action is pretty enjoyable to watch, from the army fights, to the one-on-one fight, which is quite excellent. However, the action seems to underwhelm the story, pushing it aside into an inferior role. This could just be retribution for the first film, where the roles were reversed, but in this case, it hurts the film in the long run. But even for the lengthy action sequences, the cinematography becomes a little wonky, with director Andrew Adamson, trying to be fancy at times, when the sequence did not need it. There is a noticeable death toll, but the lack of any blood whatsoever, does seem a tad unwarranted, even though this film is aimed at kids.The acting department is a definite improvement over the first Narnia film, with the veteran actors feeling more comfortable with their roles. Even newcomers prove equal matches, and thus makes for a well rounded acting performance, even though there were a few hints of actors forcing emotion into some lines. It is a pity that Tilda Swinton, reprising her role as The White Witch, gets very little screen time, and that Liam Neeson, as the voice of Aslan, does not make much of a showing.The musical score fits quite snugly within the context of Narnia, but compared to other scores in similar films, the music is not particularly note worthy. Also, the computer animation is not something to get excited about. For the most part, it looks amazing, but there are noticeable moments where the animation loses its level of achievement.No sex, nudity or even language for that matter. However the film is big on violence with it taking up a good chunk of the film. Is bloodless, with no gore, but some scenes are still violent nonetheless.Prince Caspian is not a bad film, for it is, for the most part, a definite improvement over its predecessor. However, it is not exactly as grand as it should have been, and I emphasize this point, because it really deserved better treatment. Every facet of the film fails to reach high levels: yes there are moments when they do but it is far too inconsistent for the parts to be of real use to the final product. While an improvement, Prince Caspian is still nonetheless a disappointment.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

115,brent_or,Imperfect yet still very evocative and stirring...,7,9 August 2012,"I give this 7/10 on the strength of how it ""feels"", even though the story execution falls a bit below that mark. From the very start, and especially for the first twenty minutes or so, this one really captures the giddy sense of magical wonder that is a hallmark of the Narnia stories. As with the first film, the cast is terrific; the four leads are great, and the new characters work well. The visual design and cinematography are breathtakingly beautiful, and the visual effects are for the most part pretty sharp. Not perfect, though, and occasionally some of the CGI elements stand out somewhat painfully (including some of the shots of Aslan, which is unfortunate).I really enjoyed the musical score, and the ""vocal"" songs that start playing over the last scene and through the credits; they are, to me, perfectly evocative. There is a very strong current of bittersweet/melancholy present at the end of this film, which, while really kind of sad, bolsters the emotional quotient of the whole.I have never read the book, so I cannot speak to what (in)accuracies there are related to the source material, but it sounds as if the changes made in that area may have hurt the film rather than helped it. The treatment of Peter does feel forced and inconclusive, and to some extent, the story as a whole feels a little forced in the way it plays out. I agree that it would have benefited from a little less warfare, and a little more clear character development. Regarding the ""romance"" between Caspian and Susan, which apparently was not in the book, I only wish that there had been one. Sure, it was hinted at, but did not ultimately go anywhere. Don't tease us like that. Do, or do not.Ultimately, for my money, Prince Caspian is not as good as the Lion, Witch and Wardrobe, but is still a pretty entrancing, enjoyable movie to escape into.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

Several departures were made from the novel. Peter and Caspian now have a rivalry. Susan gets a romantic interest in Caspian. The chronology of certain events are changed. The Narnians attempt a raid on Miraz's castle. Though not necessarily for the better, the changes are definitely more exciting. PRINCE CASPIAN now has a darker undertone to it. The score was absolutely magnificent, and the casting was perfect. The sword fight scenes were quite exciting and well-filmed. If the CHRONICLES OF NARNIA series continues at this high standard, I am looking forward to the next installment in the series.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
117,suessis,Not as impressed...,7,1 July 2008,"I have been a fan of the Chronicles of Narnia since childhood and to me seeing these films on the screen is the realization of a childhood dream. I loved The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, but I'm not as impressed by this one.The script makes two fundamental mistakes that make this a less satisfying film for those following the series. First, aging Caspian to more of an older teenager (17 or 18) as opposed to younger boy of about 14 as he is portrayed in the book. At the heart of this story is an innocent young lad asked to grow up before his time and take on a responsibility that he feels he is not ready for. Caspian is forced to ride the crest of a wave by virtue of who he is by birth, and in some respects by the end of the book you see a bit of resentment from him over this. This theme arcs into the next book, VDT, in which Caspian makes a voyage of self discovery under the guise of a real voyage three years later at 17 to find that he is capable and has the ability to be a great King. It's part of what makes VDT a compelling story.The older Caspian in this film is less believable as a stalwart upstanding if naive young man simply for the fact that in that world, at the age, he would have already been invited into his uncle's court to play some role, and would have been exposed to palace intrigue and court treachery. His innocence is diminished due to this. Signs of this are apparent in the film by the fact that he already has some understanding of who is uncle and his associates really are. Where as in the book the fact that Miraz wanted to kill him came as a total shock, in the movie it doesn't seem quite that impossible to him. That shock propels him forward against his will into the more adult world of leadership, duty, and honor, and what drives his character through out the rest of the story. This is lost in this film translation.The second mistake is not really building on things that happened in the first film. One of the things that was interesting about the books is the growth of the Edmund character over the course of LWW, PC, and VDT. A perfect storyline would have been him helping Caspian adjust to his change in circumstances by sharing the lessons that he's learned about duty, honor, and resentment. In turn, Edmund continues to grow more confident in himself because he's able to share this wisdom and see it work for someone else.Focusing on the Peter character's resentment at being taken away from the world where he was the main man and forced to be once again a child then realizing that what he once had is truly gone is rather discordant in the work. It also created a few rather awkward scenes, in particular a battle that doesn't occur in the book and doesn't work all that well in the film.It makes me wonder how VDT can really build on anything when the main points of PC have been lost.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

119,Red_Flag,Round two for the best Lord of the Rings wannabe to date.,6,30 June 2008,"""You might find Narnia a more savage place than you remember"" growls a oddly named Narnian, truth is it really isn't. Darker, deeper? Nah it's still the same old Narnia to me! Trading Storytelling for spectacle, and quite rightly too. Anybody baying for some action at the end of the original are in for a good time. Now I'm not saying this is an all out action movie because it's not, it takes its time with character and plotting but never dabbling in that pool for too long of a time. Think better than Harry Potter but not quite Lord of the Rings.It's the awesome transformation from the once gravely unlikable child stars that is most surprising of all. Sure Peter (William Moseley) is still rather irritating and Caspian himself (Ben Barnes) seems a little unnecessary its wonderfully to see youngest of the lot Lucy (Anna Popplewell) give a performance miles greater than that with she gave in the first film. Even if you're not into the whole theory behind Narnia. Yes the religious symbolism is getting quite annoying it's still an experience you won't want to pass up taking into consideration the unbelievable special effects and the third act that rivals that of Return of the King.The adventure continues as producer/director Andrew Adamson teams with screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely to tell the tale of the dashing Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes) -- who sets out to defeat a tyrannical king who has overtaken Narnia and secure his rightful place on the throne. One year has passed since the events of The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, and now the kings and queens of that land have returned to make a shocking discovery. Though by their calendars it has been only 12 months since their last voyage into Narnia, the four children are aghast to realize that 1,300 years have passed in the wondrous alternate universe.The Golden Age of Narnia has come to an end, and now the malevolent King Miraz rules over the land without mercy or compassion. Miraz is determined to ensure that the power stays in his bloodline, even if that means killing his nephew Prince Caspian so that Miraz's own son will be next in line for the throne. Fortunately Prince Caspian has the Narnians on his side, and with a little help from the kings, the queens, and some loyal old friends, he may be able to ensure that peace and prosperity are restored on the once-beautiful realm of Narnia.Though with the entire spectacle gathering the film stumbles at one vital hurdle. With the absence of the white witch the film is really lacking a seriously boo able baddie. Sure we have Caspian's uncle and sure he's not too friendly but his character is very ply board, a villain I'm sure I've seen on repeated occasion. Even with that looming Prince Caspian still manages to come out smelling of roses, It's an undoubtedly slow build that's for sure but Caspian delivers the goods in due time. It all seems to come down to the third, stunning act. And for that act alone you should see this.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
120,rch427,Embarrassingly stupid plot + cheap CGI = FAIL,3,11 February 2010,"I could spend many paragraphs writing explanations of how idiotic the storyline is of this film, but ultimately the fault of that rests with C.S. Lewis, whose awkward hybrid of Tolkien-esquire mythologizing and Christian moralizing doomed the story from the get-go. Suffice it to say, if you're a not precociously intelligent 12 year-old (or younger), the lapses in plot-logic may not bother you. Everyone else will probably be left shaking their heads throughout, incessantly asking ""Why the hell would they do that?!"" The other aspect of the film that brings it way down is the cheesy CGI that's so heavily relied upon. Aslan's talking is particularly annoying; his mouth looks less naturalistic than a Muppet's when he talks. The mouse character looks straight out of ""Ratatouille"" and most of the other animals and mythical beasts are likewise hokey-looking. Again, if you're under 12, this may not be so noticeable, but for those us of who have seen better CGI (""300"", for example), it will all look very crude. All in all, ""Prince Caspian"" is full of fail.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
121,badoli,Not good. Nowhere. Not a bit.,2,8 December 2008,"I guess i am just not the right audience for this one. All i have seen was a weak fantasy flick.The whole idea of having a bunch of kids being the center and deciding difference in an epic fantasy battle is beyond me, especially if they face an army of grown men. It's fantasy, anything goes, right? I haven't seen the first one, so i expect this was the one that explains why they possess all these medieval skills. Without a proper explanation it was rather implausible. And thats not the only problem. When the story is not confusing, it is mostly heavily predictable. The dialogs are dull, painting the protagonists in the movie shallow and unimaginative. Good children, bad grownups, suspicious dwarfs, warmhearted animals... Feels to me like a beautiful Grimm story, which is choked by an ill-fitting Disney/Hollywood-corset. The annoying cast kicks the rest of charm out of the window. Especially this Lucy-girl makes you want to check if you got enough contraceptive stocked.Seriously: if you are anything above 25 and not a special Narnia-Fan (and i mean Narnia, not just fantasy!

Yes, this movie wants to be epic, so the torture is over-length.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
122,JTurner82,Worthy --if somewhat loosely adapted-- successor to the first film.,8,19 May 2008,"In 2005, Disney and Walden Media took a gamble and produced a big-budget, special-effects heavy theatrical version of C.S. Lewis' classic story, THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE. The tremendous success of that film paved the way for both companies to film the remaining books in the franchise, starting with the second entry, PRINCE CASPIAN. (Actually, it's chronologically the fourth entry in the series, but that's time for another discussion.) The four children from the previous entry, Lucy, Susan, Edmond, and Peter, are called back to Narnia to do battle against the Telmarines and their ruthless ruler, Miraz. They do this with the help of the title character of this tale, Prince Caspian, who naturally turns out to be the rightful heir to Narnia's throne.One of the biggest assets about this sequel is the feel of consistency. Andrew Adamson returns to the director's chair, as do the principal actors (the Pevensie children, Liam Neeson as Aslan) and the special effects team. The adaptation of the story itself is another matter. While THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE proved to be successful in transitioning Lewis' tale to the screen, PRINCE CASPIAN was tricker. The structure of the story, half of which is an extensive flashback on the title character and his kingdom, reads better on paper than on film. A previous adaptation by BBC TV was aware of this, and cut down the story to an hour, while cutting back and forth between the children and Caspian, providing for a faster pace.Adamson's reinterpretation uses the same technique, only it omits many sequences from the original in the process; to be fair, the BBC version did this too, but some of the deletions include character-building sequences between Caspian and his teacher, Dr. Corneilius. As such, their relationship on screen feels somewhat rushed and not fully developed. For replacement, the script opts for development between two of the least well-defined children from the original--Peter and Susan. The former is more conflicted than the first (and even has a bit of a rivalry with Caspian), while the latter becomes more of a heroic figure, taking charge for the archers of Narnia. There are also a few (very scanty) flirting sequences between Susan and Caspian. These alterations may be cause for alarm with many fans of the book, but fear not--they don't come across as clumsy as they could have.If one can accept the changes made in the transition to the screen, then it is easier to appreciate PRINCE CASPIAN as a whole. The story still remains faithful in spirit, if not letter, to the original, and the magic of Lewis' world is imperishable. The CGI effects are drastically improved from the first film (Aslan in particular looks much more regal here), and the performances are splendidly done. All four of the Pevensie children show skill and enthusiasm for their roles (even William Moseley, who seemed a little stiff in the previous outing, steps up dramatically in transitioning Peter's growth into manhood), and Ben Barnes makes for a dashing, heroic Prince Caspian (although at times his fleeting Spanish accent is somewhat reminiscent of Inigo Montoya from THE PRINCESS BRIDE). Sergio Castellitto makes for an adequate villain, but not as memorable as Tilda Swinton's White Witch (who incidentally makes a brief appearance in an exhilarating scene I won't spoil for obvious reasons).However, the characters who steal the show are the animals. Aside from Aslan, the film's highlight is a swashbuckling mouse warrior named Reepicheep, brought to life with vibrant animation and a lively vocal performance by Eddie Izzard. Equally noteworthy are Peter Dinklage as Trumpkin the dwarf and Warwick Davis (yep, Willow Ufgood himself) in a brief but memorably nasty role as the corrupt dwarf Nikabrik.Despite not being as successful a transition as its predecessor, PRINCE CASPIAN is still great fun. It's not another LORD OF THE RINGS (even though there are some similarities to be had; namely the big battle sequence at the end), but for escapist simplistic fantasy, I don't hesitate to recommend it. Adamson has stated that he would be passing the director's chair to someone else for the next installment, THE VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER. Hopefully it will be every bit as good as these two entries are. (Word of note: this is pretty violent for a PG movie; parents should be cautioned.)",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
123,pintaxandre,Lord of the RIngs for teenagers,6,4 April 2020,"First of all, I hated to give such a low mark to this movie. It has many flaws. But among those I will certainly not include the music that is just amazing and uplifts the whole film's quality.
The decors are beatuiful and well exploited. It is all shot in real decors and not exclusively in carrpy CGI, so it allows to make the adventures of the Pevensies more believable.
The movie is also very well directed and edited. I do not mean by that that the director has a very personal style on the contrary, but he did his job well. I also found the fight choregraphies and battle scenes breathtaking and immersive.All these elements are very well exploited in the film, but those I will mention now are not and make the final product a very uneven movie.
The actors are not good for the most part, except maybe Peter Dinklage. But this is in my opinion the bad performances of the main cast in general that made the Narnia franchise so forgettable. It is a shame that the children are such a poor acting direction and it could have made a huge difference, had they been good.
Some CGI are not very well handled, especially when it comes to close shots with details on Aslan or the mouses. If you can't have a correct quality in the CGI, why not distance the camera from these characters and make those flaws less obvious, even if a lot of money was spent on it. The goal is at the end to have a good movie and at the end, these are mistakes that could be easily avoided.
Then the plot... By that I don't mean the story which is quite classic and agreable to follow. A classic fantasy adventure! However the plot points are not very well handled. There is a lot of time spent on the film's introduction and a lot on the final act, but what is there exactly as a development in the middle? It is shallow and makes us wonder what we saw at the end and how the characters evolve. I will admit there is a form of storyarc for Peter, but it is the only main character whose treatment satisfies me. Otherwise all the characters are empty and underused on screen. At least in the first movie they were properly introduced and characterized, even if it wasn't groundbreaking.Overall, I had a very good time watching this movie because there is a lot of heart and passion put in it. But it doesn't stand an objective examination of its qualities. I really wish I could give a better mark, but there are just too many flaws.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
124,patlightfoot,Great Special effects but ...,8,17 December 2008,"I think the story line wasn't as good as the former movie. I missed the fox cavalier, now replaced by mice or rats.

But I liked it, I felt it was a mix of 'Lord of the Rings' and 'Harry Potter in some ways. Too many Narnians were killed to me personally this was a dark side of the movie never really explained or upheld.I reckon they should have edited some to make the story line more appealing. Prince Caspian never really cut the mustard with me as the absolute hero for some reason. That's my opinion of course.I don't think a further sequel will actually work personally.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
125,bondgirl6781,Twice as Exciting and Thrilling as the First,8,17 May 2008,"""Prince Caspian"" takes a step up from ""The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe."" ""Caspian"" is a little more for pre-teens now considering the ages of the Pevensie children. One year after their adventure in Narnia the Pevensies siblings, Lucy (Georgie Henley), Edmund (Shandar Keynes), Peter (William Mosely), and Susan (Anna Popplewell) are adjusting to life in post-war London. Lucy is as adorable as she was in LWW; Susan has grown into a lovely young woman attracting boys, but she is less inclined; Edmund has become a little more mature than LWW while Peter has the conflicts of growing into a young man and is fed up with being treated like ""a kid"" after being a warrior and king of Narnia. They are called back to Narnia by Caspian (Ben Barnes), exiled prince and heir of the Telmarines. The Telmarines are a race of humans who have taken over Narnia and have driven out the magical creatures and animals into the brink of extinction. Although the Pevensies have been away from Narnia for a year in Narnia 1,300 years have passed since their ""reign."" It is now up to Pevensies, in the absence of the great Aslan, to restore peace and unity to Narnia with Caspian as the rightful heir. ""Prince Caspian"" is much more for pre-teens and teens and the spiritual journey is more complex than the first. The theme emphasized in this story is faith. Here the eldest Pevensies, Peter and Susan, are growing up and faith is something that is hard for them to grasp now than when they were younger. Whereas Lucy and Edmund are younger and more inclined to faith. I would have liked to know just a little more about the Pevensies life in post-war London (i.e. Did their father return from the war?). This film shows more of Peter's and Susan's conflicts as teenagers approaching adulthood: As a King of Narnia, Peter clashes with Caspian, the heir and prince of Narnia, and is forced to make decisions with consequences. It's quite refreshing to see the developing maturity of the two young men as they plan their takeover of Narnia. Susan, now the brave and lovely young lady she is now, catches the eye of Caspian, but the film does not focus on any romance. Susan's maturity is in her bravery and actress Anne Popplewell has the opportunity to show her amazing archery skills. The performances of the actors are consistent and good particularly Georgie Henley and Skandar Keynes (his portrayal of Edmund has become increasingly mature and witty). Ben Barnes is stunning as the title character (many young girls and women will be sighing at the sight of him). William Mosely gives his Peter a more aggressiveness and vulnerability. Anna Popplewell's Susan is mature as always, but here she is also coming to terms with becoming a woman: independent and autonomous. Scene stealing characters like the gruff dwarf Trumpkin played wonderfully by Peter Dinklage, and comedian Eddie Izzard as the voice of the swashbuckling field mouse Reepicheep (a la ""Puss N Boots"" from the Shrek movies). The villains however lack the power of the White Witch from LWW and are more less like the villains from The Lord of the Rings. Sergio Castellito plays King Miraz, the uncle of Caspian bent on killing the young prince in order for his recently born son to become heir of the kingdom. The political motivation of the Telmarines is often compared to current looks of ethnic cleansing which is something that many young readers don't quite understand just yet, but for adults is something to follow. The film is very exciting and enjoyable with some small flaws and questions, but overall it meets expectations with special effects and story. Highly recommended film.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
126,jmmustchin,A good sequel,9,10 June 2018,"The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian is a good sequel to The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, and a good adaption of the novel Prince Caspian, and overall a VERY good movie. I love it! The film has better action and is more intense than the first one. The special effects in this movie are also higher and better. The acting is splendid, as usual. And the plot of the movie is quite good. While it is rather different from the book, it is quite good in its own right. I personally think this sequel is probably AT LEAST as good as the original - perhaps better! The only reason I gave this one a slightly lower rating is because I think the scene with the hag and werewolf should have been done better, but otherwise this film is a firm winner!",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
127,Quentintarantado,Decent adaptation of the book,7,7 June 2008,"I read the books, all seven, roughly once a year since I first read them in the 90's, and I love the series. The first film was okay, at least it isn't as irredeemably bad as when Uwe Boll gets his hands on a video game franchise. It was decent, like the first Potter was decent. This one is much improved. The book has been changed, yes, and some purists in the reviews below and above me are complaining. Still, I believe that the most turgid movies are those slavishly insisting they remain faithful to the book, as if the movie is trying to be what it isn't--a book. The movies that deviate most from the book I usually find better especially if they try to tell the same story but in a way more suited to the demands of a visual (as opposed to the printed) medium. So here, the changes brings the action closer to the beginning. Well and good! Adamson is now more confident in making his action scenes, excellent! The young actors are growing more confident in portraying their roles, wonderful! I can't be unanimously ecstatic about the movie yet, Adamson (or whoever takes over) needs to dazzle me with some fancy storytelling (try Tarsem's The Fall, if you'd like to know what I'd find impressive). However, it deserved more success than it has achieved. It certainly is much better than the first movie.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
128,dutchs-1,Wow. Just.......Wow,10,22 May 2008,"Let's get one thing perfectly clear. You could make a good film out of a literal retelling of ""Prince Caspian."" The film diverges from the book in some major ways. The Pevensies meet Caspian much earlier in the film than in the book, there's no night attack on Miraz' castle, and there is no hint of an attraction between Caspian and Susan. Apparently the producers wanted to punch it up a bit.That said, the divergences make a more engrossing film and do no violence to the essential story. The night attack is suspenseful and absolutely thrilling, and heart wrenching when some of the attackers are trapped in the castle and have to be left to their fate. The recriminations between Peter and Caspian afterward allow both characters to be portrayed in depth instead of as flat caricatures, and unlike a lot of fairy tale battles, we see the grief of the families when loved ones don't return.The scenery surpasses the first film. Caspian's night ride from the castle after being warned to flee, and the seaside ruins of Cair Paravel are set in the most wonderful locales imaginable and enhanced with great camera work.The Telmarines are Spanish in appearance, style and accent, but there are no explicit Spanish references, vocabulary, or names. This actually makes a great deal of sense given that the Telmarines are descended from pirates of Earth. I liked the fact that they had crossbows, a logical progression from ordinary bows. The repeating catapults in the final battle are very nifty. If they're not historical - and I've never seen references to anything similar - they are ingenious inventions.The final battle scenes are as rousing as any ever filmed. The twin finales, where the trees attack and the water spirit demolishes the bridge, are stand-up-and-cheer moments like we used to get when the cavalry came along in the nick of time, or when Theoden and Aragorn ride out of Helms Deep and Gandalf appears to save the day.There are a few classic dialog moments that were cut short but could have been shown in their entirety without overly lengthening the film. I missed Aslan telling Reepicheep that mice gained the ability to talk as a reward for chewing off his bonds on the Stone Table, for example.Susan and Caspian's ""romance"" amounts to a few flirtatious moments and a not even PG kiss on the lips at the end. Totally harmless.Next up: Voyage of the Dawn Treader, my favorite. I sure hope they can keep it up at this level.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
129,stiva,"Charming, but up to the level of part I",7,31 December 2008,"I watched this movie recently and decided to post my reviews for it. It's a good, fun movie, but, not as good as the first one. Kinda looks like it's repeating. Though they added new creatures like trees fighting which was already brought in Lord of The Rings II: Twin Towers. This time the action sequence lasted for almost an hour, that is to say, the second half of the movie is the ending. I guess they could have shortened the battle. Also, there are way too many dramatic scenes. As for the humor part, I guess it's okay, but not memorable.Other than these, the Special effects are awesome. The music is good too. I guess the characters have improved in their acting since the last movie. Also, I guess I could have seen more of Aslan's in the movie.It's good movie and a charming one too, but not a great one. Though, don't expect too much. Afterall, it's a children's movie. It did what it meant to do for the kids.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

131,m_shankar20,A Fable,6,24 May 2008,"Chronicles of Narnia is what it is - a fable, with talking animals, magic, etc. There is a moral if you want to draw but I think there is never a dilemma. If there is, then it is not portrayed by the actors. It is because of that I lost some interest in the previous episode and the same happened this time.The young actors have failed to portray the aura that would want me to believe they were once (or had the becoming of) great kings and queens of Narnia. They look like kids with weapons.Visually, the film is spectacular. The forests look colossal and mighty in almost all aerial shots. The graphics/cgi is very cleanly done.Take your kids out to see this film. You may be more happy seeing them happy then probably with the film itself.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
132,Astralan,A good Sequel,8,19 May 2008,"First off, I would like to thank the moron on IMDb that touted this movie as an uninvolving, unemotional war drivel of a movie. I went in thinking this movie had no heart. Serves me right to be totally mistaken. Who cares? This wasn't about a war. This was about a battle. Who cares? All the characters that represented the kingdom of Narnia. Who cares? Me. First off, I have to admit this: I had a very difficult time paying attention to this book. It really didn't grab me in the same imagination as The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe grabbed me. This was a first book to a series. This was where the heart was brought into this world. And no matter what, nothing can really live up to the first book. The big question I have is: You have 2 book down; are you really going to be able to complete the other 5 in a way that will involve the audience? Narnia is at risk again. Millenniums have passed in the course of a single year. Our Kings and Queens still think Narnia is in pristine condition. It takes them a while to realize that it is not; that it is being undermined; that the animals of Narnia that once could talk have long lost their abilities to not only care about the proud heritage they belong to, they have become deaf to the callings, and fallen into animalistic behavior. Spoiler: Caspian is an heir to a thrown that doesn't want that position. He is someone that has fallen into rebellion (as most young adults in his age group). Ruling the way that his kingdom is ruled is not something he wants to follow. Unfortunately there is little else to turn to. So, he is absconded with. But during that battle, he evidently blows a horn that ripples it's vibrato into a world not of his own, calling help wherever it can be found. The Kings and Queens of Adam are not just 4. The Telmarines aren't who you think they are, and the trees are really quite formidable when appropriately stimulated. So, with not quite the thumbs up I gave for the first book and movie, I still give Prince Caspian an enthusiastic thumbs up... simply because not only where the battle well met, but the sympathy for the Narnians future in full play. A good movie for all children and adults. -B",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
133,joliefille411,Doesn't Pack the Punch of the First One,7,7 February 2010,"I get the feeling that I am in the minority on this opinion, but I do not think PC was the better made of the first two Narnia Films. Yes, I am a huge fan of the book series, but no, I am not a fan of PC, in fact I found it rather boring. So I won't go around knocking the movie just because it deviated in many ways from the book. In fact, many changes were a cinematic improvement. There were, however, some things that made the story much worse.Firstly, the casting. Honestly, that was a whatever to me, sure Ben Barnes wasn't passing off as 13 in anyone's lifetime, but I have no qualms accepting the character as a little older than Peter. Good grief, I didn't even mind Tilda Swinton making a reprise (though what was up with the design of the hag?). And I will give my stamp of approval on the Night Raid for packing pretty much the only effective emotional punch of the film. The final mega-battle just didn't impress me- we'd kinda seen it before in LWW- this one opted for spectacles over emotional stakes, but even all its PG glory couldn't outshine Lord of the Rings, so yeah, I've seen better.And here we come to the changes (mostly in characterization) that pretty much effectively neutered all the positive trimming and editing afore mentioned. First off- why are we making Peter a jerk? Honestly- does every teenage male have to be a moody egomaniac with no foresight? It didn't even develop into a decent character arc- he was just inexplicably hormonal the entire film until a rapid change of heart in the last scene- about 5 scenes too late for me to be able to give a crap. And then there's Susan. Ohhh, Susah. I was not the fanboy screaming ""Yuck- they're kissing! Eww, oh no its so gross!"" But I do object on the grounds that its so completely out of character for the whole film. Yeah there's some subtle, really corny almost flirting, and then all of a sudden, she's gonna lay one on Caspian in the end? Makes no sense and really gives the feeling that Adamson lost his balls and cut out the majority of the buildup due to fan reaction while still being reluctant to part with the kiss. Which pleases neither the die-hards nor the people who would just like some believable continuity please. Of course, this could all just be a way of making us so disgusted with the older characters that we won't miss them the next go-around. In that case- bravo.And for the younger ones, I really enjoyed them. I was glad not to feel guilty for rooting for Skandar this time. He's just too freaking charismatic. And Georgie still kept Lucy out of the annoying tagalong territory. The supporting cast was well done and yes, the visuals were really, really good. I'll concede a step up from the first one.Prince Caspian had the means to surpass its predecessor. If only it hadn't spent most of the time letting the leads wallow around in an unsympathetic funk. I'm just glad we have a chance to go at it again with an infinitely better story- The Dawn Treader!",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
134,Netscape_Navigator,there's a reason why I avoid fantasy movies,3,31 December 2008,"And this movie is a great example why. I lucked out with the first Chronicles movie, it was good enough that I gave it a 7. It did everything that a movie like that should do, without any major mistakes. This sequel however lacks everything that made the first one good. It has no human element. It literally feels like they just went through the motions and decided to make a fantasy movie for kids, with no regard for script revision, character development, meaningful dialogue, etc. It's a BASIC kids movie, which means nothing truly has to be fleshed out. This approach will ALWAYS result in a fundamentally bad movie.**All the charm from the first movie was gone, and other than Lucy, these characters just aren't likable very much at all. The girl playing Lucy did a great job here like last time though, I hope she gets many more roles.**What's up with the constant, sweeping, forced, emotional music?**Edmund and Susan felt like role players. They got lost amidst the shuffle of all these characters. It got to the point where I was consciously watching to see what lines they would speak next. And those lines mostly consisted of soulless, interchangeable lines that could've been spoken by one of the bears or cheetahs for all we care.**I really hate to compare it with the Lord of the Rings movies, but it's really hard not to do when you have walking trees going into battle, a water creature summoned to wash away bad guys on horseback, and bow and arrow tricks being performed which doesn't involve actually shooting the arrow..**Susan's kiss to Caspian at the end goes in my book as one the most contrived kisses I've seen in awhile. There was nothing that happened for her to even develop these feelings. From what I can recall, there was no more than one or two times that they even specifically looked at each other. And during the times they did that (looked at each other), I was actually praising the movie that they didn't overdo it with these forced exchanges where the girl shyly looks at the handsome hero, with just a hint of a smile on her face, as she then walks away as the hero searchingly gazes at her, with a wondering, thoughtful look on his face, before the scene fades to the next. I was glad they DIDN'T go this route and kept it subtle. Well so much for that; she ends up randomly KISSING him on the mouth at the end. Contrary to what movies may have you believe, this NEVER happens. Ever. No girl does that. Think about it from a real life perspective, this would be the equivalent of you helping a female friend unpack her things after a move, during which time her female roommate is also there (which sets the scenario for you sort of knowing this other girl), and then after all the unpacking is done, the roommate comes up to you and just plants one on your mouth. How realistic does that sound? Bottom line: no girl walks up to a random guy and just kisses him on the lips. This whole clichéd romance angle hurt this movie's credibility even more. **I haven't seen a forced romance this...forced, since Winona Ryder inexplicably fell in love with Edward Scissorhands after she saw him on TV and he said he would ""do anything for her.""",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
135,The_Other_Snowman,Isn't Monarchy a Little Outdated?,3,26 July 2008,"What I learned from watching Prince Caspian: 1. Monarchy, far from being an outdated and worthless system of government, is in fact a viable alternative to democracy. Everyone should place their unquestioning loyalty behind the children born to rule, regardless of their qualifications. It's their birthright, after all.2. God has no need to prove himself to us; rather, we need to prove our worthiness to Him. We should also do exactly what He says and feel ashamed for questioning His existence.3. Brutal and constant violence is okay so long as no blood is seen to be shed. It's even okay when prepubescent children are the ones wielding the swords, because God loves child soldiers -- a fact that has been proved time and again in South America and Africa.4. When adapting a beloved children's book for the big screen, it's okay to simply copy scenes directly from the recent adaptations of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, because creativity and originality are overrated, and the audience won't notice. Walking trees attack the enemy, a river magically rises up and washes enemy soldiers away, huge catapults hurl boulders toward the heroes' camp as the prelude to a giant battle, a heroine uses her bow and arrows in the most unlikely fashion -- can you guess what movie those events come from? 5. No one cares about the plot or characters. What people want is more generic fantasy movies, so be sure to book those New Zealand locations far in advance and hire a good special effects team. Because we all know that a fantasy movie that's not filmed in New Zealand isn't a proper fantasy movie at all.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
136,zapdude,Disturbingly bad,3,9 December 2008,"Probably the most scattered, incoherent, poorly conceived and executed big-budget feature yet made.The first movie was good, really it was. I had never read the Narnia books, I was too busy reading LOTR and Science Fiction to be much interested, so the first movie got me involved in the series.This one, however, seems to completely fall apart. Things happen for no apparent reason. People do things with no apparent motive. CG and live characters stand around in huge crowds simply watching others do things. For a long time. With no apparent result. Then they cheer. Yawn.Characters appear and ""save the day"" with a roar. Waves crash down rivers just like in LOTR, except not as exciting and for no apparent reason other than to show off the alternate CG that might have been created for LOTR. A giant battle sequence appears in the middle of a story that didn't have one. Yawn.I shudder to think that anyone could find merit in this movie. As a standalone movie it is horrific. As a desecration of the original author's intent, it is inexcusable, shameful, and embarrassing.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
137,Strider_1978,Things never happen the same way twice child- This is unfortunately true.,4,2 June 2008,"I'm sorry I feel this way, but I have to be honest.The negative:Are people truly so mesmerized by special effects that they do not look deeper than the icing? As far as I was concerned, very little in the way of substance 'cake'.I had warning lights when I heard the first scream in the tower and observed the acting of Caspians mother. Am I being picky for a feature aimed at a younger audience? Perhaps. But if they could get it right in Wardrobe, why not with this film also?I feel that the first five minutes of the film was far too reminiscent of lord of the rings. Caspian fleeing the castle in pursuit followed by dark clad horseman, coincidentally managing to get over a ford of water and jumping over a tree log in the forest. Does that ring any bells? And on that note we had no real connection to go one between Caspian and Dr Cornellius. Their relationship was not fleshed out or given anything more than a few exchanged lines of dialog in hasty moments. All of a sudden he has to leave the castle and head for the woods. This I feel this was a mistake. I feel like they took all of the magic from the book and translated it into something else. Even in such dire circumstances the characters in the book at least had charm and a degree of merriment. The kids no doubt did the best they could, not being seasoned actors. Frankly I blame the direction. The two shiny ones in my view are Edmund, and following not far behind Caspian himself, who appears to have a little more experience in the field. Trumpkin might as well not have been there for what he contributed. Again, this is director decision. At least he put on a convincing British accent.The special effects suffered this time around. Very obvious models, though some of the shots were more grand scale. I felt that on more than one occasion things looked very Shrekish. The Centaurs, rather than moving fluidly, looked quite awkward and un-settled. They probably thought some of us would not notice such a school boy mistake, but by jove they were mistaken :) In Wardrobe I really felt the scale of battle. This time round I felt they tried to pull of a return of the king skirmish with people in armour. I did not believe that it was the world of Narnia.I feel that the plot was un-necessarily altered. Storming a castle. . Peter turning into a Jealous brat. C.S Lewis wrote this wonderful tale to appeal to children. What they did served to overcast such wonderful themes of nobility and loyalty, courage etc. I suppose they decided to make it more pre-teen friendly. The trouble with this is that it's Disney. And even though they attempted to give the action more 'edge' they still had to tone down to make it audience friendly. I did not think that what was contrived, worked at all.The positives. .well. .Edmund and Caspian and Aslan at least give enough to help is to remember what the film is about.Everything that Aslan says to Lucy, at least saving the underlying themes that Lewis crafted so cleverly.All in all, my wife enjoyed it, but she has not read the book in fifteen years.As far as I am concerned the movie contains no joy, and is little more than a series of staged scenes. I won't be reading Voyage of the dawn treader.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
138,anifanmc,"Darker, better, and cinematically thrilling",9,16 June 2008,"I will admit that when I went to see the movie with my young cousins I had some reservations. The first film didn't enthrall me quite as much as it did some of the younger children I know, simply because it was targeted at a much younger audience. Thus when I saw the PG rating upon the box office tickers, I groaned slightly. I thought then that it would be an exercise in futility to find something good in a film which rated itself on a base of intelligence fit for that of a third grader. Of course, the moment I entered the theater, let's say I was very pleasantly surprised.Let me make this clear from the beginning - as an older reader, I never appreciated CS Lewis's writing. He wrote for children obviously, and his aim was to imbue the story with a distinctly Christian undertone, particularly at the expense of other religious beliefs (particularly Islamic ones, which is why I suspect the production companies won't be touch The Horse and His Boy or The Last Battle). As per the time, the books are also quite racist, with the good guys being light skinned brown haired Englishmen and the bad guys being the dark skinned Dwarfs or Calormenes.Thus, I was pleasantly surprised when the producers decided to make the admittedly morally gray Telmarines of Hispanic origins, with a definite Crusader element (particularly the battle masks). Their accents are decidedly Mediterranean, and Caspian himself, played by Ben Barnes, is a dark, dark-haired individual. Beyond these superficial details, despite the depiction of Telmarine society as full of excesses, the film does not dehumanize them as Lewis tends to do with his antagonists; rather, he gives them full coverage, even giving very broad character perspective to morally gray characters like the Lord Sopespian, and even Miraz, who is THE antagonist of the whole show. He's not a single-minded killer; his mind has been driven by greed but he finds no pleasure in killing his kin.Then there is the question of Lewis's alleged sexist tendencies, which I found to be quite obvious in the novels. Susan is a ""heretic"" of sorts at the end of the book, and neither her nor Lucy are powerful characters, with Peter and Edmund driving the majority of the action. Rather, they tend to play the part of the docile trophy girl, who learns to speak when spoken to and things like love, sexual attraction and attachment are seen as bad. Authors like Pullman and Rowling have repeatedly seen this as Lewis denying the idea that women need to mature and grow up, sort of sticking them in the situation of a lifetime nun-hood. The film disposes of any such trivial stereotypes, and adapts it to modern times, giving Susan a romantic relationship with Caspian (or at least some form of tension) and giving Lucy a fighting spirit that she didn't have in the novel (she's willing to slit the throat of one of the traitors). Susan's character was completely and totally revamped, in my mind - she was a fierce, beautiful, and powerful fighter and executed her battle spirit with cold precision.If someone is coming to watch this film because they are a CS Lewis purist or are expecting the film to follow exactly from the book, they will be severely disappointed. The film takes considerable liberties in both the order of events and even adds in events to make the story more dramatic and epic. It makes the film an even better story than the book, in my opinion, simply because it presents a more plausible version of the fantasy than the fairy tale that Lewis originally wrote where good is good, bad is bad, and there is no morally grey line. Near the end of the film, instead of simply having Peter walk away from combat, Caspian has to make a very dark choice and the internal struggle within him is readily apparent. Even as the famous High King, Peter is no angel either. He's a troubled individual who has a conflict of maturity, having lived a full life in Narnia to adulthood, and yet returns to England as a child again. He and Caspian both come to odds, instead of Caspian simply blindly obeying the legendary figure. Such character development, nevertheless, only furthers the film instead of bogging it down in details.The plot is not overly complex or difficult to understand for younger children, yet by the standards of an older audience it is an incredibly deep one. Thus, it satisfies the needs of the children who come to see the handsome prince take back what is rightfully his in a Lion King-esquire manner and also placates the viewers who see Hamlet in Caspian and his troubled state.As for the obvious religious undertones, I feel that the film does a fantastic job of both presenting what was Lewis' original Christian message and yet making it uniquely applicable to many faiths. Not being a Christian myself, I found that when Aslan talked about Lucy coming to him, it still resounded quite a bit within the borders of reaching God within my own faith. Atheists and agnostics won't be disappointed either, since the thematic nature of the film is targeted more towards understanding the concept of justice and maturity than about religious belief and faith.Overall, a fantastic film, a must-see. The only issues I would indicate are the lack of development for a couple of minor characters, like Nikabrik and Reepicheep, the latter who plays a very significant role in the following novel. Yet overall, it manages to please.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

140,phantopp,Didn't make me want to read the book,5,8 September 2009,"Four siblings (William Moseley, Anna Popplewell, Skandar Keynes and Georgie Henley) are whisked back in time to the magical land of ""Narnia"" when the four are waiting for a train.They find the land, in which they were declared royalty hundreds of ""Narnia's"" years before, in ruins.They eventually learn that the prince (Ben Barnes) of the neighboring ""Telmar"" summoned them with a magical horn, and decide to help him get to the throne as he was destined.However, the uncle (Sergio Castellitto) of the prince, who is king of ""Telmar"", wants the prince dead. But, the siblings and the prince rally the ""Narnians"" into battle.Let me say this first that this, and the last one in the series I watched (I think it was the first movie in the series, but that was long ago) is not making me want to read the books they are based on. I usually lean more toward science-fiction than fantasy, so that could be the reason as to why I don't want to read the source material.I found the story long, and dragged on fairly slow. However, it never slowed to a crawl. In fact, though the pace was pretty slow, it was just fast enough to keep you from getting too bored. The beginning of the movie was really slow, and made me want to turn it off. However, once the siblings got to ""Narnia,"" the movie's pace picked up to something more bearable.I wasn't really impressed with the performances in the movie, but the actors did a fine job. I did like how the chemistry between the actors worked out, especially those who were in the previous film.One thing that must have looked amazing on the big screen was the scenery and special effects. From what I have read about this film, a good majority of the film's budget went to the special effects -- of which there is a lot. In fact, this film heavily relies on special effects.In this film, you get scenery that would be impossible, if not too expensive to make. You also get at least 99% of the cast as CGI characters.I usually hate characters made entirely by a computer, but the ones in this film are simply the best I've seen. Usually, human actors aren't looking into the CGI characters' eyes when they are together on screen. However, it appeared to me that the CGI characters are lined up perfectly.The only downside of the CGI characters is that hair and fur do not look realistic ever. Look at the animals in this film on close-ups, and you will see what I mean. This is especially evident with the lion ""Aslan"" (voiced by Liam Neeson). In close-ups, the fur on his body, not to mention his eyes, don't look realistic. However, the animation is amazing with all these characters.The voice actors worked very well, including scenes with real people. Many times, I forgot that I was looking at a talking lion or mouse. I have to give props to the human actors who had to perform with the CGI characters. Their performances helped bring the CGI characters into reality really well.I wasn't really impressed with character development with new characters in this film. The lead villain had only enough screen time to explain to the audience why he does what he does, but he doesn't get enough time on-screen to develop in a way to where you would not like him the instant he returns to the screen.If I remember correctly, the actors portraying the siblings were pretty bad in the first film. There was some big improvement, especially with the youngest actors. If you ask me, the human actors really didn't stand out from each other.Wardrobes in this film were great in this film. Human clothing mainly consisted of darker tones. There were no brightly colored outfits that stood out like a sore thumb. The clothing seemed to be really accurate for the time period.The action was spread out through the entire film. None of which built to the battle between the forces of good and evil. There was one major battle, followed by a sword fight that was really hurt by it being placed right after the battle.Because the world of ""Narnia"" is over a thousand years ago, you deal with weaponry that does produce blood. However, there is no blood where there should be. Parents will not have to worry about any serious amounts of blood, nor will they worry about any foul language.Except for one particular piece of music, I really don't remember the soundtrack in this film. I do remember one song near the end of the movie because it's the only one I noticed with singing. Most of the music is just instrumentals that did help enhance the scenes. It was nothing memorable though.Catch this on HBO if there is nothing else on. This movie, in my opinion, is not good enough to skip a favorite television program over. It almost comes close though.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
141,brodie_kashmir,Better than the first,9,21 May 2008,"The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian 4.5 Stars You know, Peter Jackson, god bless him, but he set the bar so impossibly high for epic fantasy film making. Damn your rings and the lords of them. However... directer Andrew Adamson continues to come within striking distance of said bar with his thus-far very impressive and equally epic Chronicles of Narnia series, continuing this past week with part 2, Prince Caspian.So, the Pevensie children, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy (William Moseley, Anna Popplewell, Skandar Keynes and Georgie Henley, respectively), when we left them at the end of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, they had vanquished the White Witch, brought peace to Narnia, and grown up to be legendary Kings and Queens. Then they get transported back to the real world, where literally no time has passed, and they are back to being kids. In the second installment, it's a year later for them, yet 1300 years have passed in Narnia. And they return after Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes) calls for them on Susan's mystical horn. Caspian is the rightful heir to the throne, but in a move reminiscent of the Bard, his uncle, King Miraz (Sergio Castellitto) made a deadly move for the throne by killing Caspian's father. Miraz is a tyrant, all the Narnians are now thought to be extinct, yet they're just living in hiding. So Caspian, along with the Pevensies, must bring peace, order and balance back to Narnia.As previously stated, the bar for epic fantasy is so, well, epically high, that it seems almost unattainable. And it's hard to compare The Chronicles of Narnia to Lord of the Rings, because they are so different thematically, in tone, in presentation, in style and in it's target demographic.But there is still that similar genre, so comparisons must be made. The reason the Narnia films have done, and will continue to do, so well where others like Eragorn and Golden Compass and even Bridge to Terabithia have failed is that it seems to refuse to placate to the childhood nostalgia aspect. The others have played it safe by staying safely within the realm of ""kids movie,"" never having to invest a lot in grabbing older audiences. But Narnia is going all out in it's movie making. While it is significantly toned down, when compared to LotR, it doesn't feel like a ""kids movie."" And it is the one series, I feel, that can truly be enjoyed on every level by kids, parents, and even grandparents.Adamson presents the film, and the story, for that matter, as is. He doesn't ""dumb it down"" for the kids, and he doesn't get too convoluted with the storytelling. He respects the source material, C.S. Lewis, and the audience, and that's the strongest thing this film has going for it. And despite the PG rating, the battle scenes are really intense. Very well done.I always take time to discuss the actors, because they need to respect the material just as much as the director or writer does. Adamson gets some absolutely fantastic performances from the young actors, who descend in age at 21, 19, 16 and 12 (Moseley, Popplewell, Keynes and Henley). Their grasp of the characters they play, the importance of the script, their handling of the script, and the subsequent gravitas they bring to the characters shows talent that some actors more than twice their age struggle to exhibit. With the third installment, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader already in pre-production (set for a 2010 release), I'm gonna miss Moseley and Popplewell. Peter and Susan are not in that book (not for long anyway), so they won't really be in the flick. And they'll be missed. By me anyway.Definitely hit the theatres for this one.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
142,joris-nightwalker,"Christian propaganda, part 2",2,29 December 2014,"Even worse than the first Narnia film, Prince Caspian must be one of the most amateurishly acted movies I've seen in ages. While in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe you can forgive the child actors of finding their way in the acting world, discovering an own style and making authentic emotional expressions combined with their memorized lines, it is much harder to forgive them for it when there's almost no improvement to be seen three years later (except for maybe Georgie Henley). On the other hand, just like with Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint it takes some time to adjust. For them it also took two Harry Potter movies to get the acting really going. Sadly it makes Prince Caspian hard to watch. There are no James McAvoy and (almost) no Tilda Swanton to cover things up this time. We get Peter Dinklage instead, but that nearly suffices. Especially with Ben Barnes doing a ridiculous Spanish accent. The storyline again is smothered by Christian symbolism and the cinematography by ridiculously bad blue screen effects. The result again is an awful picture that irritates more than it amuses.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
143,piksplanet,Even better than the first one....,8,21 June 2008,"In 2005, when The Chronicles of Narnia : The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe came out; I found myself introduced to a brand new epic tale. The film is probably one of the best when it comes to adaptations from children's epic novels. With recent failures in the form of The Golden Compass(Bad. Very bad. Absolute waste of time), and The Order of the Phoenix(700+ pages in 2hours and 15minutes? No, thank you), it is high time we got to see a real epic children's movie. I haven't read any of the novels by C.S.Lewis, however I have read that there are similarities in his and J.R.R. Tolkien's writing. With Prince Caspian, the second installment in the series, a saga which has been compared time and again with The Lord of the Rings, the journey could just be beginning.Prince Caspian, probably the blandest of all the Narnia novels, starts off 1300 years after The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe when it comes to Narnian timeline. In the real world of the Pevensie children however, merely a year has gone past. Prince Caspian, the rightful heir to the throne of the Telmarines is forced to flee because of his corrupt uncle, King Miraz, who is trying to steal the throne from him. Caspian blows the ivory horn given to him by his professor when, while fleeing, he chances upon Narnians in the jungle. The horn, in turn, summons the Pevensie children - The Kings and Queens of Old, back to Narnia, to aid the young Prince in a fight to obtain the throne which his rightfully his.The first, and only complaint I have, is the sudden start to the movie. The journey of the Pevensie children back to Narnia, although shown wonderfully, when, while in a subway, they get taken back to Narnia, comes way too quickly. There is hardly any time spent in the real world here, unlike in the first part, where there are glimpses of the ongoing war and the journey is more drawn out. There should have been a little more detail with the Pevensie's in the real world. That would have made the journey back even more interesting.That aside, the movie moves fast enough. With simultaneous shifts early on between Prince Caspian, the Telmarines, and the Pevensie's, there is a lot of attention to detail. Lucy's dream of meeting with Aslan is particularly well shown, where she imagines the jungle to be what she remembered it as, with the dancing trees and flowers, unlike the 'more savage' Narnia of present. Highly detailed, and it just shows us beautifully the connection between Lucy and the great lion.There are an array of new characters in this movie. Ben Barnes who plays Prince Caspian could have been better. His accent however, promises better things in the future installments. From cynical dwarfs to a swashbuckling mouse, every new character gets more screen time than any character except Harry has ever gotten in a Harry Potter movie. The pick of the lot being Reepicheep the mouse, voiced brilliantly by Eddie Izzard. You will find similarities between him and Puss in Boots from Shrek 2. Both, Errol Flynn'ish in there portrayals. Whether it is jumping up at being called cute, as if it is insult, or darting into an army of human soldiers, Reepicheep is bound to capture the hearts of everyone. Cannot wait to see what they do with him in the upcoming films.The Pevensie children are all back.William Moseley, Anna Popplewell, Skandar Keynes and Georgie Henley playing Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy respectively. The younger two play there part well. Moseley is good, and you'll know why he was once considered for playing Harry Potter once you see this. Popplewell however, is bland. The White Witch, played by Tilda Swinton, has a small cameo here, and is as icy as ever. The other, very integral character is Aslan. Although he doesn't appear till the very end of the movie, there is a definite air of expectation around him. Everyone is waiting to see Aslan again, powerfully voiced by Liam Neeson. And the roar. What a roar! Enough to awaken the trees to wreak havoc through the Telmarine armies, enough to send ripples through the lake.The war sequence is brilliant, with some of the best visuals I have seen off late. As is the square off between King Peter and King Miraz. Very well choreographed. With a very engaging background score, Price Caspian runs to two hours and fifteen minutes, keeping you interested throughout the length of the feature. I do have an objection to the song near the ending. It was really cheesy.Following up the great The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is difficult. But, Prince Caspian does justice to that. Keep aside the fact that you are seeing a bunch of children killing people in a magical world since, after all, it is a children's epic. There isn't much emphasis on the killing part anyways. Thankfully, more importance is given to how Lucy brings the dead back to life with her potion.The Chronicles of Narnia : Prince Caspian is a good film. Its a pity, however, that director Andrew Adamson, who has made this and the previous one will not be returning to direct The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, the third in the series. It is often seen that such series' lose their lustre if they undergo a change of directors.8/10 overall. Loved Reepicheep more than anything else in this movie. Worthy follow-up to a saga going great guns!!",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
144,Pulpthatsfiction,You Know it Wasen't that Bad,8,17 May 2008,First of all I really thought this was gonna be bad. I never thought it would come close for me to it was OK. Of course the acting is going to be awful but what do you expect from these kids. That and of course the somewhat bad ending is really the only thing that is bad about his movie. The film making by Andrew Adamson especial the directing was very good and I'm sad that he will not be directing the next installment. The music and the rat is the best part of this movie and especially the rat. The music is very dramatic and really gets you into the mood that you should be feeling and Of course the special effects are pretty good. The battle scenes are quit epic and was very surprise that there were really good. This film won't rank up with best of the year but the music and the rat make this a must see.,The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
145,johnjohnson68510,"Did you like it, but felt something missing?",8,18 May 2008,"I liked this movie very much. For the first 45 minutes I was completely on board every moment of the movie. After it ended, I walked out more or less satisfied, pretty much glad I had just spent fifty bucks taking my wife and numerous children to see it.However, there was something about it that I couldn't put my finger on which seemed a little off, a little too light.I wondered if it was just that vaguely disappointed feeling I sometimes have when all the mystery of a beginning is cleared up. But I don't think that was it; a lot of movies I walk out feeling better than I did with this one.Why wasn't I completely satisfied? What kept this film from greatness? Forgive me for being picky about something this good. This movie had many tremendous elements. I don't want to take away from its remarkable achievements, from the performances, to the effects, to the pacing of the stunts, to the cinematography  all outstanding, well done work.I think the problem the writers had was, in part, how to present a deus ex machina ending again, in the second installment, without descending into hoakiness. They had Aslan announce, twice, mystically, that for some reason he couldn't just pounce in and clear things up because ""Things can't happen the same way twice."" We can just accept that, I guess, but it doesn't seem like enough.Here's the point, why I'm writing this: There are important subtleties of the spiritual life that either escaped the writers, or that they were unwilling to risk exploring in a venture with hundreds of millions of dollars at stake.They touch on these issues, briefly, to drive the plot on: For example, Lucy reminds them before their first battle that they had only won against the White Witch because Aslan fought for them. Peter fights anyway, without waiting for Aslan, and has a terrible defeat.So for the next battle, they send Lucy to fetch Aslan. But very little happens in their hearts, and this is where things needed to happen.Aslan's rescue, as it stands, seems arbitrary. If they had come to him, instead of like they were borrowing a big hammer, but with the understanding they needed to serve him, not try to use him, then I think the movie would have achieved much more. It would have been more about the internal struggle, over their pride and hubris, over the temptations of the White Witch, etc. The Fellowship of the Ring went deep into the internal struggles of each of its main characters, and for me that's a big reason it was a great film. In this movie, I never had the sense that Peter and the others had learned their lesson. They seemed almost unaware there was a lesson to learn. Aslan is kind of like the Ring they get to use, with a little coaxing from Lucy, and that's that.It reminds me now, Sunday morning, before church, after seeing the movie last night, of a story of the Israelites. I forget under which king or judge this happened, but the Israelites were afraid of an upcoming fight with the Philistines, and so they fetched the Ark of the Covenant. Like it was a tool. A great cheering went up among them when it arrived, but they lost the battle badly, and lost the Ark for a while. It took them some time to figure out they had a lesson.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

A Darker, More Violent Narnia Emerges!",10,14 May 2008,"Wow, Prince Caspian, the long awaited sequel to the box office smash, The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe finally hits theaters in North America on Friday May 16th.Without spoiling the film, this is a much darker, at times funnier, and a much more adult Narnia sequel than the first film.The Pevensies have grown up, show more angst and are experiencing emotions that weren't in the first film.A lot more action, and a lot darker storyline could frighten small children.I would not recommend this film to any children under the age of 7 as some of the more violent acts could frighten them.However, this is a terrific fantasy film, with some of the best action, I have seen in years.

147,YourFamilyExpert,"Good, but should have been PG-13",7,16 January 2017,"While I enjoyed the first film's story more (it was so clearly an allegory for The Atonement, The Resurrection, the Battle of Armageddon, and the Millennium), this one is better made, better written, and better acted. Plus, it has a healthy share of Christian symbolism itself, some rocking battle sequences (how this is only PG baffles me; the intensity of the action has PG-13 written all over it), and some of the best effects I've ever seen (the badger, in particular, is photo-real).The idea that the kids actually grew up in Narnia, then returned to their world while retaining all their knowledge and maturity intrigued me (and it makes their battle skills more believable). All that said, I still didn't find myself nearly as emotionally invested or involved in this as I was with The Lord of the Rings, the standard with which it will always, perhaps unfairly, be compared. Why Narnian humans now have Italian accents is beyond me, and some of the jokes fall flat, but all in all it was very good; better than the first in terms of storytelling, character, and filmmaking. ***1/2 (out of five).",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
148,sloopydrew,Rough around the edges,6,17 May 2008,"Prince Caspian expands on the battles in the book; turning them from a few pages long into 30 - 45 minute epic fights that borrowed more than a little from The Return of the King. While competently choreographed -- this is far from the cinematic epic the overreaching soundtrack wants you to believe that it is.The movie is entertaining, but rough around the edges. The editing is poor and one scene in particular should have been removed entirely as it does nothing for the film, outside of extend its already substantial length.Is it better than The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe? That all depends on your stylistic preferences. If you're the wonderment, fairy-tale, unlimited Turkish Delight type you'll prefer the first Narnia. If you're a darker, sword and sorcery fan you'll consider Prince Caspian the better movie.Both were worth the price of admission, but both left me feeling like they were one script doctor, soundtrack and/or director away from being the perfect fantasy movies they could have been. That said, Prince Caspian certainly warrants a bucket of popcorn and a fun Sunday afternoon at the theater with the family.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
149,PeterWorthers,Empire Strikes Back this is NOT,3,17 May 2008,"I will admit that I like the first Narnia film, and was wanting this one to be just as good but for some reason it fell flat for me. Why (other than the fact that my daughter continued to tell me how 'Dreamy' Prince Caspian was) let me count a few of the ways. First off, it seems the poor Pevensie siblings will continue to be taken advantage of. Hey we need help lets blow this horn and bring those 4 kids back...then when all the fighting is done and the day is saved ""Get the hell out of our magic kingdom"" and they are sent back to their sad lives in their 'present' day. Why not let them stay with you? Wouldn't that be a small thanks for what they did? Second, the battle was trying too hard to be like Helms Deep on Lord of the Rings, at least thats the way it seemed to me. Third, after the failed castle siege attempt, all those Narnians get killed and all, then what do we see later? The same castle with the people that live in the castle throwing a happy parade for the returning Narnians. What the heck? First off, shouldn't everyone there be scared of them, apparently Narnians were just fables only a few days ago, plus the Narnians are the same ones who a day ago snuck in and killed your husbands/sons/fathers...and now you act like nothing is wrong? Forth, the Pevensie siblings are in the underground one second, then the next WHOOSH! They're in a strange land...and what is the first thing they think of? WATER FIGHT!!! Aren't you scared or curious as to where you are? How do you KNOW you're in Narnia all the sudden? Maybe you were wisked off to New Jersey? YOU DON'T KNOW! Fifth, if Aslan could have helped the Narnians from the start, then why did he purposely let them walk into a battle he knew they couldn't win without his help? He waited till how many of them had died senselessly till he decided to step in? Come on. There are just a few, but the movie on whole seemed to drag out and I found myself wanting it to end. Will I see this again? No. Will I buy this on DVD? No. Sorry Narnia, This just didn't do it for me. But the one thing I will take away from this is....Prince Caspian is Dreamy.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
150,Norway1,"Dull, Preachy, Beautiful",5,23 May 2008,"Suffers from being too preachy, too long, and far too unexciting (until the last 20 minutes).The first Narnia was interesting and exciting. This was just plain boring - even though it looked stunning and beautiful!But worst of all was having to feel like I was sitting through a Sunday school lesson. Honestly, it was that ""preachy"" to the tune of:""Have faith in what you have no evidence for - even when all else points to it being false."" and ""Even if everything is against you and all is bleak, if you believe you will come out on top.""The Good: * Amazing visuals, including costumes, sets, locations, and effects. * The newcomer lead who plays the young Prince does a fine job.The Bad: * WAY too long (2½ hours) for such a simple story. * Slow pacing and uninteresting (too many?) characters. * The sermons. * The child actors (Lucy excepted). * Annoying animal characters. None as endearing as the beavers from the first film. * Crappy bad-guy. The White Witch was sorely missed. Spaniard king was just plain annoying. Too much of the movie was based around his character. * Too many characters to follow and too much happening.The book kept the story simple and told it in a brisker pace. The movie tried to add too much more to ""flesh it out"" a bit, but this hurt it rather than helped. Too boring and far too long.Sorry for the long review. I hope you find it balanced and honest. I could have spent more time on how beautiful the film was and how excellent the effects were (for the most part) but that is kind of a given. Even with a higher ""production value"" this film just isn't up to par with its predecessor.Unless you're a huge fan of the books, loved the first film and don't mind a slow-paced preachy film, skip this one and watch Iron Man, Indy or even Speed Racer instead.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

However, I would have added something more to the film to make it better.",7,2 January 2015,"The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian is a spectacular (and more spectacular than its predecessor) and entertaining family adventure, worthy of the standard set by its predecessor, as well as darker. It has a great beginning, good continuation and a great and emotional ending which left me shattered and in tears. The movie is overall nicely done. However, one thing which I think could have made this second Narnia chapter better would have been to make it into a film which has a bit or some of the Lord of the Rings elements combined with the Narnia elements in order to have a slick and more delicious genre result for the Narnian universe. Also, this second Narnia chapter, while fun to watch, is still (in connection to the first chapter) not good enough in quality to out-rival other similar fantasy movies that have a chance to beat it in genre quality.

I fear that my personal opinion might influence the review. From what I've read about it in other reviews so far, I have only one thing to say about the fact that it's an adaptation of C.S. Lewis' book by the same title: I can understand the let-down for people who have actually read it. I read The Voyage of the Dawn Treader and I recognize the let-down of a poor translation of a book to a film.
What's good: Ben Barnes, Liam Neeson, the fantasy lore, the battles (!), and for me personally, the nostalgia.
What's bad: The dialogue, the actors portraying the Pevensies, the length (especially the first half is incredibly slow).
This might be different for fans of the series, the books, or other fantasy films, but this is my very personal review. I hope it is in any way helpful.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
153,zanghi_james,Great Film and Sadly Under-Rated Fantasy Epic,8,15 June 2019,"I love fantasy films, especially ones based on classic (or contemporary) novels, like Peter Jackson's Middle-Earth trilogies and George Lucas' original six Star Wars films. So, I was pretty excited when I heard that Disney was adapting Narnia and I figured Disney would do well adapting all seven books. I loved the first one (The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe) and was confident that the sequel would exceed my expectations.Guess what?It did.I loved Prince Caspian and I actually approve of the changes/additions to the story that Andrew Adamson and the scriptwriters put in from original text. From what I remember reading in the book, the story had very little character development and was rather vague regarding certain aspects. This movie fleshes such things out much better. I thought the character development was interesting, also, especially with Peter and Susan's scenarios, as both of them added depth and tension to the story. Also, the (in)famous Attack Sequence on the Castle of Telmar (and its conclusion) helps the movie's story heavily by expanding Miraz and Caspian's characters. Plus, it is a really well-done battle sequence that ups the stakes for the climatic third act of the film.What surprised me about this film was its rating and the level of action in it. Despite the film being rated a regular PG, the level of violence in this film is on the same level as Peter Jackson's Middle-Earth films (extended versions), perhaps even Game of Thrones-level of violence. The only differences are that there is little-to-no blood shown throughout the film and the more graphic injuries (like the part where Reepicheep basically slits a soldier's throat or when Peter beheads a Telmarine soldier) cut away right before the actual act is shown, though you DO still hear the sound effects. I think the only other Disney film (that isn't produced by Marvel Studios or Lucasfilm) that has this level of violence is another under-rated fantasy epic: John Carter.Even though it should get a solid PG-13 rating for the action sequences, this film is really good and highly enjoyable. The special effects are great, too, and the fight scenes are very well-choreographed, especially the duel between Peter and Miraz.But the true heroes are, appropriately, the actors themselves with some stellar performances and not just Ben Barnes as the title character and the four Pensevie children returning to reprise their roles. I loved the Narnian characters like Trufflehunter the Badger (Ken Stott, who would later play one of my favorite characters in the Hobbit Trilogy: Balin, son of Fundin), Reepicheep the Mouse (the ever-cool Eddie Izzard who portrays the iconic character like if Errol Flynn did a Redwall film), the various Centaurs and Minotaurs, and of course, Peter Dinklage (Tyrion Lannister from Game of Thrones) playing the heroic and cool Trumpkin. The villains are well done, especially the actor portraying Miraz the Usurper King, but Warwick Davis (who I only just recently learned was in the BBC Narnia productions!) also gives a savage performance as Nikabrik the Dwarf. Liam Neeson and Tilda Swinton's performances as Aslan and Jadis are great, as always, also.I think Disney and Walden Media should have kept making these films and kept Andrew Adamson around as director for all of them. I hope Adamson returns for the reported Netflix adaptation of The Silver Chair that is supposed to be coming out someday, because the Narnia books deserve to be adapted fully as a series.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
154,wolverinesforever,Well...,6,16 May 2008,"It was on a sudden decision that I went with a group of friends to a 9:10 showing of this film that, at the time of this review, was yesterday. I had quite enjoyed the first Narnia, but upon seeing this one, I felt kind of blah. Most of my friends felt the same way. Don't get me wrong, the film is well put together. The visuals are impeccable, the production design is well done, the costumes look great, and the actors do fine. Unfortunately, the material seems to be lacking.One year has passed in our time, but 1300 years have passed in Narnia. Since the four Penvensie children left, Narnia has been overcome by the evil Telemarines, who have banished all Narnians. Now, the evil king Miraz hopes to permanently establish the Telemarine stronghold, but his throne is threatened by his nephew Prince Caspian. Miraz orders the boy to be murdered, but Caspian escapes, and inadvertently calls for help. This is where the Penvensie children come in, as they are whisked away from London back to Narnia, to restore balance in a now grittier land.You would think that with a title like ""Prince Caspian,"" the filmmakers would work to make our hero well rounded. Unfortunantely, they really don't. The whole backstory involving the raising of Prince Caspian from the novel has been cut, making our hero less 3-dimensional than we would want him to be. The filmmakers have also seemed to believe that since we got to know the children in the first movie, we don't need much characterization involving them again. King Miraz looks like the bad guy version of King Leonidas from ""300,"" and his motives seem muddled. Not until the end of the film did I really feel his evil presence, and by then, it was hard for me to start fearing him. The result is that we, as the audience, don't feel very involved with the story. There are characters, some good, some bad, but you are not entirely sure what their motives are.As far as the acting goes, I was fine. There were no standouts with this movie like there was with Tilda Swinton in the last one. Part of this I blame on lacking material.Since we are not involved with the characters or with the story, all we can do is watch the nice stuff that has been put on screen. Simply put, this is a well put together film that doesn't have a whole lot of material backing it up.Hopefully the new director for ""The Dawn Treader"" will do better.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
155,jctundis,A steep and unfortunate drop in quality.,3,26 May 2008,"The first movie was fantastic. You'd be better served watching that one again - because Prince Caspian is one of the more disappointing films this year.OK, so Prince Caspian the book isn't exactly on par with The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe - so maybe the source material itself prevents this film from coming close to the first movie - but there is also a painfully obvious drop in budget from the first film.The pacing is very slow, so I don't advise you take the children to see this one - or like 25% of the population in the theater I saw it in you'll walk out before the end.I was really looking forward to this film. CS Lewis' book series is among my favorite childhood memories (even though I do not share any of Lewis' religious beliefs which are so prevalent in the series) and this film was a letdown on almost every level.It simply lacks any of the magic of the first film. It is stale and boring.Hopefully they come back strong with Voyage Of The Dawn Treader, my favorite of the book series.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
156,flyingamon,Not as good as the first one but still good,7,17 April 2011,"The second movie in the Narnia series is a complete different story in which the Pevensie children are called upon once again to save Narnia, this time from a bunch of humans who invaded the land. I won't give too much away just saying that with only the 4 children returning to pick up their roles (and 2 other protagonists from the first one but only briefly). But the have all gotten 3 years older which leads to a more adult story. With 2 big battle scenes it started to remind me more of Lord of the Rings. Although I didn't like that too much I still liked the story and its characters presenting us with some new interesting ones such as Prince Caspian and of course the brave mouse Reepicheep. Just like in the first one all the talking animals are digital creations. I think it's pretty impossible now to make a believable conversation between humans and animals if you would make use of real animals. I was mostly disappointed with the fact that Lucy (my favorite character) didn't have that much screening time here but thus was the story. Her role was still a key factor in coming up with a solution.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
157,phrixion,"Pretty good 2nd installment, more fantasy adventure like rather than whimsical",8,27 May 2008,"Prince Caspian, the 2nd installment of the The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe series by CL Lewis takes off right away. If you did not see the first film, the viewer will be lost, because the kids are lamenting about how they had come back through the Wardrobe and would never be going back. But somehow, in a moment, they are whisked back to Narnia.The film, like the characters have developed a bit more intelligence and more savvy as they take on the next challenges in Narnia. No witch to enchant them this time but a power hungry uncle of Prince Caspian out to get Prince Caspian and the Narnians.It's a good ensemble piece and the characters are well played, action is pretty consistent and only a few slower more explanatory plot mechanisms through out the film. The special effects are top notch, follows the book quite well and for a film. Really enjoyable if you or your kids have read the Chronicles of Narnia books.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
158,lucasaq-1,A Fun But Quite Changed Version of the Story,7,20 May 2008,"Andrew Adamson's latest adaptation of C. S. Lewis' Narnia trilogy is a fun but quite changed version of the story. The main characters are a little bit older than in the previous film and new-comer Ben Barnes is much older than his counter-part as written in the novel. Thus the dynamic of this tale is greatly different than the novel by virtue of the change of one of the main characters alone. There is more friction between Prince Caspian, Barnes' character, and High King Peter, William Moseley in slightly better portrayal this time around, as each try and lead the troops. There is also an added romance between this ""dashing"" looking Prince and Susan. Not so welcome changes to book purists, but they do allow for more action and perhaps the director got tired of working with kids who knows. Personally it's a change I can live with given the simplicity of the story in the novel and the flavor of the first film which was a bit too kiddish. This film is darker and does not waste time jumping into its tale which is both a plus and minus as not exposition is given for Caspian's character or his teacher which makes it appear a bit rushed. On the plus side is the action occurs much sooner.Speaking of action though, I felt the film tried too much to incorporate action just for the sake of action with all these changes to the plot not really furthering all that much, but just adding fluff for a longer running time. On top of that some of the climax action sequences were unnecessarily slowed down at certain points for ""dramatic"" effect which did not add anything. They felt cheesy. Mostly I am referring to the fight between Peter and Miraz. I do not know how it could have been better, but it felt awkward. Still the action in this film overall was better than in the previous film and due in large part because of the improved sword play of the Peter and Edmund.The story itself is nice and clean like the first film which makes for a good fantasy film with a beautiful setting. The children are back in the magical land they discovered in the first film and brought back by Caspian to help him win back his thrown for himself and the forgotten inhabitants of Narnia who have been invaded by a foreign force, humans called Telmarines. The children find Narnia once again in poor state like the first time they arrived last time, but this time they have history to call upon to their aid and again they have to learn the lesson of faith. There is also an underlying theme of mercy being good which was good.The characters like in the book were quite colorful with the standouts being Reepicheep, the mouse who is swashbuckling bundle of courage and honor, Trumpkin, a dwarf with little faith and a bit of a pessimist but strong to the end, and, of course, Prince Caspian. Each character was pretty well fleshed out as they needed to be for this film, some for those familiar with the books will know there will be time for more expounding of character later. Aslan too makes a timely appearance leading to some of the more amazing sequences of the film as in the most visual stunning of the film.The special effects were also nice and crisp not a very telling increase over the first film, but there seemed to be bigger set pieces with bigger effects required. Standout sequences for me included the water spirit like Triton and the trees coming to life.All in all the film was good continuation of the series although there are a few major changes that did not sit well with me, I was pretty much pleasantly surprised on the whole with the enjoy ability factor of the film. And it did have a nice story with a good message as expected from a C. S. Lewis novel adaptation no matter how watered down it becomes. The children have improved from the first film and the action was more intense as well leading for an all around good experience, but the film fails to top the predecessor in story values and strength so in all I would say it achieved a nice success out of one of the weaker and shorter books of the series.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
159,mollidew,Exciting adventure story,8,19 September 2009,"This movie is not a sequel. This is just another book in a series about Narnia. Movies never or rarely follow the books closely and often have to embellish or combine characters to make the movie entertaining and fit into a reasonable time frame. Don't watch this movie with the expectation of it being like the book, then you might enjoy it as I did.I thought all the actors did a wonderful job in their roles and some of those who played animal characters were charming. I don't understand all the fuss over a romantic sub-plot, they are teenagers after all and Susan's character is attractive and so is Prince Caspian and it seems to go naturally with the story. I really think it is a brief bit of fresh air to get away from the battles.Please don't compare this to LOTR since Tolkein and C.S. Lewis were friends and it irritated Tolkein how Lewis would mix his mythology. They had totally different views on writing fantasy stories other than they both made them full of battles. Enjoy it on its own merit. I felt it was a really good movie and I hope to see more of these stories.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
160,whatever_123,What did they do??????,2,4 September 2009,"I saw the first Chronicles of Narnia when it came out and fell in love with it. The scenery was beautiful. The acting was great. The animals were fun to watch. The action sequences weren't overdone, and there was even a good amount of humor.Everything the first movie did right, this movie completely destroyed!! To start, the acting wasn't as great. Take Lucy for example, in the first movie, she wasn't that great as an actress, but you could forgive her, because she was a cute little girl with short, bouncy red hair. In this movie, she's a lot older, definitely not as cute, and you begin to see how atrocious her acting really is. Prince Caspian was okay, but at times he seemed to be trying too hard to seem sexy and alluring with his fake-sounding accent.This movie had no understandable plot line. In The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe, it was always clear what was going on and the story was entertaining and cute. In this movie, nothing seemed to fit together. The story is pretty clear at first, but somehow it gets all messed up beyond understanding later in the movie. Half the major scenes in the movie didn't make sense at all, like someone in the studio said, ""Hey, let's just throw this in here and see what happens."" The action scenes were too long and the motives of both the sides of the battles weren't clear at all. Of what I could understand, which wasn't a lot, they were fighting for no reason.Whenever some form of magic happened, all the characters stared stupidly in awe, as if they've never seen something like it before. Wouldn't the Pevensie's, after spending MANY years in Narnia before, be used to it? Why did they act like they never saw magic in their lives, when they obviously did before in Narnia? I was angry at how little we got to see Aslan. He also didn't seem to be there for any particular reason. Also, the White Witch's brief appearance didn't really add any depth to the story. It was simply a showcase of some impressive special effects.What REALLY, REALLY bothered me about this movie was the scene at the end where Prince Caspian and Susan kiss passionately. Why? Because their relationship never evolved during the movie AT ALL!! It was completely out of nowhere! What were these people thinking when they made this movie?? Did they forget all the things they did in the first movie that made it great?? I'm glad we got this movie on Netflicks. It would have been a huge loss if my parents wasted money to see this disaster in the theater.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
161,matrix29,I learned many things from this movie about Narnia and Prince Caspian,6,19 May 2008,"Firstly I wish to state that the special effects, costumes, battle scenes, camera work, sound creation, screenplay writing, direction, acting, and everything else was superb about this movie. Great entertainment is to be found for all in this movie.Now onto the ""What I learned"": (1) In battle, a mere bloodless slice across the chest is not only enough to kill a man (thank you ""Lord of the Rings""), but also enough force to cause them to collapse to the ground.(2) Although great leadership by ""The sons & daughters of Adam"" for over 40 years remains well beloved, your deeds and works will all be forgotten in 1300 years.(3) Narnia's time passage runs much faster than our own. A mere year of time results in 1300 years passing equal to one of our years. 1 Earth day = 3.56 Narnia years. That means in ""The Lion, the Witch, and The Wardrobe"", 40 years of life in Narnia equals 11 days on Earth. So, children missing for 11 days on Earth will not cause any hysterical reactions when found stumbling out of a closet by a kindly Professor.(4) A viewer should not expect any drastic technological improvements in Narnia even with a 1300 or longer year jump.(5) A Christ-like lion (the embodiment of the creator of Narnia -- AKA the Sysop of Narnia's universe) will wait until 98% of Narnia's native population is slaughtered by inconsiderate humans before getting off his lazy butt and taking an active interest in local affairs.(6) Even worse, after dawdling like a senile shut-in for 1300 years of unrestrained slaughter of the native Narnian magical-animal & humanoid-hybrid population to come to the rescue at the last minute of centuries of pointless horrific bloodshed, the remaining native Narnian population will cheer this long-absent grossly-amoral sociopathic Christ-Lion with the eagerness of starving slaves praising their cruel enslaver for getting a few table scraps of food.(7) Then after all has passed and an uneasy forced peace is enforced by the nearly genocidally-exterminated Narnians and the exterminating Telmarines (humans) the Christ-Lion will politely banish two of the group of four who saved his sorry broken kingdom in a super-jackass move.See kiddies, movies can be educational.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
162,regnarghost,"""Nothing Is the Same Twice"" Aslan says and lies through his teeth!",5,8 January 2009,"Were back in Narnia! Back to beat the bad guys! A little less interesting antagonist then before but a whole lot of more foes to battle. Whoho! No, this isn't a very good film. Yes, it looks neat enough and it has its moments. But its hard to care for a film with so boring characters. I mean, Peter and Susan is as dull as they come, especially the magnificent one. Lucy, i liked in the first film, but that cute stitch starts to wear a little thin no? And Prince Caspian? Does he even have a personality? The only one thats likable is Edmund, definitely the odd one in the bunch. There are some nice side-characters indeed, but aforementioned characters should be the heart of the story, and they just doesn't cut it. As a story its also one of the C.S Lewis weaker one. He probably made it work in the book, i don't really remember, but this has all the markings of a rehash. Even more so of you consider recent film history and some of the solutions in the battles... whats up with the Ents and that shaped flood-wave here... Aslan lied through his god damn teeth! Im telling you! I know LOTR and this was written long ago and at about the same time but its a directors job to keep things fresh, if needed be, through radical changes. As for the good things, they are here too. The battle at Casle Paravel is probably this movies highlight. Reepicheep got some fun lines to and that grumpy dwarf comes of as likable. Now, younger viewers might embrace this film, and thats OK, for really, its meant for them. But older ones looking that just wanna feel like children for a while might find this a bit derative. Personally, i will hold my thumbs for the next installment because its based on a much less clichéd story. As i remember it anyway.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
163,ungy357,A rousing fantasy adventure.,8,14 May 2008,"Director Andrew Adamson, who helmed the first installment in the series, after making his career primarily in animation (including the original ""Shrek"") seems decidedly more comfortable in his role as a live action director this time around, and he handles the scope and the pacing of this epic adventure with a polished skill that is a very pleasant surprise. In addition, Georgie Henley, Skandar Keynes, William Moseley and Anna Popplewell, returning as the Pevensie children, have matured, not only physically, but in their acting ability. There is a deftness and self assuredness this time around that surpasses the original, and makes for an extremely entertaining film.The story begins with Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes), nephew of Miraz (Sergio Castellito), the leader of the ""Telmarines,"" the human population that is now the dominant race in Narnia, fleeing for his life when Miraz's wife gives birth to a son. Miraz usurped the throne from the rightful King, Caspian's father, and now that he has an heir of his own, he wants Caspian out of the way for good.Meanwhile, back in London, Peter and his siblings are trying to adjust to life in the real world. Peter is getting into fights because he can't bear people ""treating him like a kid,"" after growing to adulthood before leaving Narnia, only to return at the exact age he was when he first stepped through the wardrobe. But in less time than it takes to board the London underground, the Pevensie's are once again transported back to the magical kingdom - only it is not the place they left. Over a thousand years have passed, and the castle of Cair Paravel lies in ruins. As the children struggle to find out what has happened, they stumble upon a Dwarf named Trumpkin (Peter Dinklage), who is being taken prisoner by abusive Telmarine soldiers. Susan, who doesn't seem to have had much opportunity to show off her finely honed archery skills at home in Finchley, eagerly takes the opportunity to rescue Trumpkin from his captors, and the surly old dwarf (whom Lucy and Edmund nickname ""The D.L.F."", or ""Dear Little Friend,"") explains that all is not well in Narnia. It seems that not long after the High King Peter and his siblings left Narnia, the land was plunged into a dark age, and the Telmarines have ruled for hundreds of years with an iron fist. The days of the many creatures, including talking beasts, living in harmony together, have long since passed, and no one has seen or heard of Aslan the Lion in centuries. And what's more, the trees are no longer friends to the Narnians - they are just normal, everyday trees.It doesn't take long before the children meet up with Caspain, who is hiding out in the forest with a misfit band of followers, and soon the young would be heroes join forces in a plot to reclaim Narnia for the Narnians, and place Caspian, the rightful heir, on the throne.The film moves along at a steady, exciting pace, with skillfully staged action and suspense that will have audience members on the edge of their seats, and while in general it stays very faithful to the source material, there is quite a bit of added embellishment to make for a grander and more spectacular epic, with added battle and chase sequences that are deftly handled and add to the story and the level of excitement, where in less skilled hands they could have easily overtaken it. The level of action, and violence, is really quite a bit stronger than in the first film, and the film has a darker, grittier tone, which makes it something of a surprise that the filmmakers got away with a PG rating for what is clearly a PG-13 film. As mentioned before, the actors really step up to the plate this time, in particularly Keynes and Moseley as Peter and Edmund. But the most delightful performances come from the great Peter Dinklage (known for his brilliantly subtle turn in ""The Station Agent,"" and perhaps best remembered as the diminutive author of children's books in ""Elf"") and Reepicheep, a bold and chivalrous mouse (voice of Eddie Izzard), who really steals the show. The effects are absolutely top notch, and in the final third the movie reaches such a fever pitch of excitement that it recalls Peter Jackson's ""The Two Towers,"" arguably the most exciting installment of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy.So, in the end, ""Prince Caspian"" may not be the profound allegorical tale that ""The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe"" was, or reach the same level of magical wonder, but it more than succeeds at what it sets out to do, and strongly indicates that there is a future in the Narnia franchise.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
164,Cel_Stacker,When you're not looking...,7,16 May 2008,"The fantastic legend of that other world called Narnia continues with a second act that, again, does fine justice to the masterpieces of C.S. Lewis. A year after the first adventure, Peter (William Moseley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), and Lucy (Georgie Henley) find themselves being shipped away again, this time to school. As the doldrums of the coming excursion rear their heads before they can even leave the station, the Deep Magic strikes again, and the Pevensies are whisked away to Narnia a second time. However, a millennium and a half has passed there. Cair Paravel is a ruin, Aslan is nowhere to be found, and the last vestiges of the Narnian citizenry are under threat from the new ruling class, the Telmarines, with the influence of their ruthless regent, Miraz (Sergio Castellito). A new army is needed, and one is haphazardly gathered under the banner of fugitive ruler, Caspian X (young stage veteran Ben Barnes). But before he can take the throne, Caspian must overcome political treachery, and face the terrible truth about his family. This is a grand afternoon at the movies. Once again, Andrew Adamson and Christopher Markus meet the challenge of serving a story that needed no service. Sharp accents, neat touches, and slick dialogue abound, but the powerful script is a clear step up from the wardrobe. It's said that part of God's way of doing things is selecting the most unlikely personnel to do a task. Narnia is surely all about that. Appealing characters come to life again, well-cast, with Peter Dinklage outstanding as the disillusioned Trumpkin and voice-master Eddie Izzard stealing scenes as the cavalier Reepicheep. I rein in from saying any more, to sustain the surprise, but the wonder of Narnia is fully realized once again, in a more mature, hard-hitting adventure.

168,jn1356-1,Way to Translate!,9,17 May 2008,"I don't read the Chronicles of Narnia. I visit Narnia at least once a year; and I've been doing it for about 30 years now. So you may consider it authoritative when I say that they didn't exactly use the novel as a shooting script.You may also trust the word of a premier lover of Narnia when I say, in response, ""So what?"" The condensation of Prince Caspian's backstory is brilliant.I fell in love with the actors playing the Pevensie kids in ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"", and I love them still. I thought then that they really looked as if they could be brothers and sisters; growing up has changed that a bit, but not seriously.The effects looked absolutely seamless to me. You'll believe a badger can talk! And Eddie Izzard's voicing of Reepicheep is very nearly perfect casting! I very much enjoyed Ben Barnes' acting as Caspian. I always saw Prince Caspian as younger, and blonde. Their vision differed from mine and I couldn't be happier.On to the ""Why?"" department (Warning: Slight Spoilers Ahead): I understand changes have to be made to translate a novel into a movie. But I don't understand why the animosity between Caspian and Peter, nor why it never is resolved to my satisfaction.The Telmarines seem disturbingly Hispanic to me. I wish the ethnic resemblance could have been lessened.Why add the who sequence about trying to take the castle?

I was told afterwords a certain battle scene was added just for the film, and I could only imagine the reason being the movie-going public made need more jolts of action that the book lacks. But as a stand-alone film, it was quite enjoyable, full of awe and wonder.It does suffer from what I would call ""The Curse of the Two Towers"" in that the middle chapter emphasizes action over plot development, but it made not work for this since it's far from a trilogy, but nevertheless a rich and delightful (albeit quite violent) film.

I don't want to make sweeping comparisons just because they are fantasy films, but anyone who has seen the LOTR series cannot fail to see the blatant similarities. Trees save the day, a river rises up magically to sweep away the enemy? These things may very well have happened in the book but it just felt like we'd seen it all before. I don't think the Narnia movies do anything particularly new or inventive in the genre, apart from adding Chrisitian overtones (which seemed even more obvious in Prince Caspian).The battle scenes lack any tension (partly because the Telmarines aren't as good an enemy as the white witch) and the main characters are once again mostly irritating. Peter might look the part but the way he talks makes him sound effeminate. At least the actors playing Lucy and Edmund have improved.

After loving The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, I was sure that I was going to see Prince Caspian in theaters. When I saw the first film, I noticed that it wasn't the first book, which I found a little strange. Since I never read the Prince Caspian book, I'm just going to talk about the film itself.At the end of the first movie, Peter Pevensie (William Moseley), Edmund Pevensie (Skandar Keynes), Susan Pevensie (Anna Popplewell), and Lucy Pevensie (Georgie Henley) got back to the real world after discovering the magical Narnia land. One year later, they return to Narnia, only to discover that 1,300 thousand years had pass during their absence. Now, most of the Narnians had become extinct and the land under control by the Kind Miraz (Sergio Castellitto) and the Telmarines (Miraz's army). Peter and his siblings soon met Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes), who has been running away from his evil uncle Miraz from preventing Miraz killing him and putting his newborn son on his place. With the help of Prince Caspian and the reminders Narnians, the siblings go on to find the missing Aslan and rescue Narnia from the evil King Miraz.I think the storyline in Prince Caspian is much better than the original. I really like the humor in the story. Even though it didn't have a lot of humor, but at least it has some. I also liked the dark elements in the story. It felt more like an adult fantasy movie than a kid fantasy flick.There was nothing really big in the performance from the actors. Everybody gave a good solid performance. I thought Ben Barnes was a great choice to play Prince Caspian.The special effects and the action were amazing. The effects were very realistic and than the first film.

In this part of the story we are introduced to Prince Caspian who is ultimately responsible for bringing back the Kings and Queens of Narnia. They all reunite with the Narnians and together they fight to restore beauty and peace to the land once again. This sequel was surprising well done. The characters were more dynamic and better developed and the actors delivered fine performances, perhaps even better than in the first. Newcomer Ben Barnes was the perfect Prince Caspian. The ending was sort of unexpected and a bit sad but the story is far from over. However, I did think that the film probably should have been given a ""PG-13"" rating because of the battle scenes.

And we the audience are supposed to feel pity for the smaller army of good and hope that they will find a way to win. This is quite generic and frankly, quite overdone! To make matters worse, those Narnia kids have the same strength of a fully grown men. One stab of their blade and the enemy soldier falls to the ground. So fake and a pain to watch! I felt a lot of background story was missing and maybe this would have helped the movie. When I think of Narnia and the main actors, epic battle isn't a thing that comes to my mind. This sequel has lost a lot of the charms of the first one.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
174,nunemkh,Best picture of the year!!!!! NARNIA RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,10,17 May 2008,"The first time I watched Narnia, which unfortunately wasn't in theaters, was one of the best experiences of my life. Everything about that movie was so lovable. I loved the movie so much i bought the complete book series and am still reading it now. After a few months I heard about a sequel coming and I was thrilled to say the least.And now finally It came out in theaters and my friends and I, being true Narnia fanatics, went out to see it opening day. I didn't remember everything about the Prince Cspian book so there were still many surprises I had along with anticipations. The movie starts out great and the introduction is surprising enough to hook the audience. And once we're hooked, we are once again introduced to the Pevensie children. The way that the Pevensie children miss Narnia makes me think about how I miss my home country and other places I am fond of. And after a few minutes of getting to know what they're current situation is, the movie wastes no time in taking us all back to Narnia.But this time around, Narnia is 1300 years older and 1300 times more savage. The old days of magic and mythical creatures of Narnia is close to dead thanks to a tyrant named King Miraz. Don't worry you'l hate him within two minutes of seeing him in the movie, and this is no thanks to some irreverent scene were the evil tyrant brutally punishes someone for a very small mistake they made. I'm glad they decided to stick to the topic in this movie and not fool around with irreverent little scenes. Prince Caspian is a character with a lot of history and his feud with Peter is very interesting.Also it was very fun for me and my friends to see how the characters have grown. Susan looks more beautiful than ever and so does Lucy. Edmund is a more descent person, and it seems Peter is the one learning the most lessons in this movie.Besides the characters there was also the sets. By far some of my favorite settings are in these movies. There is one scene that i can't say too much about so as not to spoil the experience for, that gave me such a feeling of reminiscence. And there was the fight scenes. Besides there being a much more epic battle in this movie than in ""the lion the witch and the wardrobe"" there are more battle scenes through the movie. There is even a one-on-one combat that will leave you STUNED! My friend and I had our jaws on the floor after the combat sequence.Honestly there are so many great things about this movie. The story is very deep and filled with great twists. There are so many emotions that can be felt while watching this film. "" Prince Caspian "" is such an outstanding, smart, and mature addition to the Narnia series, even though there is so far only two films in the series. But I have no doubt there will be more. After such a successful and wonderful film, Andrew Adamson would be crazy not to continue.I strongly recommend this to any fan, fanatic, or even a beginner of the Narnia phenomenon. The CGI is tops and greatly surpasses the already great CGI in the first film. Watch it for Alsan, Lucy, Susan, Peter, Edmun, and of course watch it for NARNIA!!! And after you've watched it, buy it. But I would recommend some searching and patients for I think there will be a special addition released after the regular edition. Thats what they did with the first movie and I think thats what they'll do with this one.Once again I say go out and Watch Narnia, the best picture of the year!",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
175,jhobdell,Welcome back to Narnia...,9,9 July 2008,"...you may find it a more savage place than you remember. Everything about this film shouts a different Narnia. The childlike wonder was brilliantly portrayed in the first film, and in this second instalment, it is a much more mature and understanding vision (as it should). The whole atmosphere was quite Gothic and Hispanic (the latter clearly the main inspiration for the civilisation of Telmar). Personally I would have liked the music to reflect that more, but overall the musical vision was similarly matured.The darkness of the action was almost shocking, but also welcome - in particular the duel between Miraz and Peter.On a spiritual level, there is still much to take from the film in terms of insight into a spiritual life (obviously Christian in particular given Lewis' own faith), especially with the idea of act or wait, faith or works, and internal conflicts.An important part for me was the brief romance between Susan and Caspian. I can imagine many people objecting to this, but to me it was a brilliant herald of things to come - I'm sure those who have read all the books know what I'm talking about.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
176,samuelsson91,Narnia is one big simulation and it is hardly an average!,5,28 December 2008,"While I was watching Narnia, I realized one important thing: the worst movie is a movie, which is pretending something. And exactly this is Narnia doing. But it begins very nice. A lovely nature, forest, ruins, sees… It fills you with positive energy. But when 4 small kids are trying to pretend like kings, the movie is completely destroyed. It is not original, the actor/ress performances are very weak, and Narnia becomes an infantile, theatrical patchery. The whole thing is very improbable, and you cannot compare it to the Lord of the Rings in any way. I read the book story and it is more like a fairy tale than fantasy (sci-fi). What did the producers try to do? The exact reverse. They put there a battle, which is very messy and it ends very boring. On the other hand they could raise the oppression and life in the forest (cohesion of the animals like in the book). Narnia is one big simulation and it is hardly an average!",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
177,xenolupa,Shame on Disney,2,18 July 2008,"The movie is not like the book. No way like it. The essence is out, the plot is different, the story lines are all changed, lots of things are taken out and lots of things are added, most horribly all that fighting and the wars.This is an attempt by Disney to be better than the Lord of the Rings movies, well, they are not better, they make a completely incomprehensible story that disgusts any Narnia fans that read the books or that saw the BBC movies.What disgusts me even more is the enormous amount of people that gave the movie a 10 and wrote a comment: these comments all read like Disney adverts. It's like people of various Disney PR agencies got the order to write a positive comment, without having seen the movie or having read the book. Just a lot of advertisement babble. Read those comments in the comment listing, sorting on ""Loved it"" order. It's amazing how much marketing blahblah can be spotted! I didn't expect Disney to do such things, and certainly not on IMDb.Shame on Disney! Shame for butchering the book. Shame for making a violent movie where people and animals are killed and tortured, but without blood, so killing is OK. Shame for the PR babble in the reviews.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
178,abeburnett,As poorly written and directed as the first,5,6 June 2008,"I continue to be extremely disappointed in the Chronicles of Narnia series of films. Production values are always high (lots of cash being spent on these films) but the acting is wooden in the extreme (with the exception of the two youngest actors), the direction equally as wooden and inappropriate (moving when it should be still, still when it should be moving; shots often lack drama or seem obviously posed), and the score is intrusive. All in all, this is ham-fisted film-making at its worst. It's a shame they couldn't do a better job adapting such classic works of fiction. I gave this second Narnia film a chance after hearing it was ""much darker"" than the first--which I interpreted to mean that it was, like Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith, bound to be better than the previous film(s). Alas, it was not to be. True, this second film IS ""darker,"" but unfortunately it is not remotely ""good."" Go in expecting it to be bad, and you might end up satisfied. I, however, was not.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

Avoid this garbage at all costs.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
180,Vanyel,"Christian fantasy, not Epic fantasy",2,19 May 2008,"The only good thing about this movie was that it is visually appealing, from the special effects to the scenery to Ben Barnes. How Kyle Smith could say ""it isn't so overtly Christian"" is unfathomable, unless he's had no exposure to Christianity whatsoever.My biggest problem with the movie relates to that: in an Epic fantasy, the heroes earn their victory, and the lessons they learn from their mistakes along the way help them achieve it. In this movie, while the ""heroes"" do learn a few small things, victory is achieved not through their efforts, but rather because a little girl ""believes"". Even that is not a big challenge: she knows he's real because she's worked with him before. The only question is whether or not these particular visions are real, and if he's trying to help, what's the point in only letting one person see him? Letting hundreds of people die until some chosen person comes to beg for help is reason for disdain, not adoration.If I hadn't been there with friends, this would have been only the second movie I've ever walked out of, at about the point when she went off to fetch him and I realized that they were going to end the movie with ""deus ex machina"".",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
181,restin_him,If only I hadn't read any of the books.,5,18 June 2008,"In some ways I think film makers who create films based off of beloved books have a hard and thankless job. They must balance the creation of a film that anyone can like while still remaining faithful to the subject matter for the fans of the books. Adamson did this brilliantly in the first Narnia movie creating a rich and deep world faithful to the book while still bringing in those who never did read it. Unfortunately he missed the mark sorely with Prince Caspian.I tried very hard to separate this film from the book but came up with the conclusion that one can not do that in cases like this. True, movies are never better then the book so you have to go in expecting changes, however this film is so far from the book that if the characters names were changed one would never know it was a Narnia based story. The film felt more like a story someone else wrote and simply pasted names and small scenes from Lewis's book to make it fit the mythos.First things I like... Miraz was great! He was evil and developed in ways he wasn't in the book and I thought it was fantastic. I also liked how we got to know Miraz general Glozelle. That character showed a man who was on the wrong side but still had honor. He was worthy of what he receives at the end of the movie and was a great addition not included in the book.Now on with the problems. One of the biggest was the dialog. Long gone is the intelligent flow of language and in its place is a modern interpretation of how people should talk to fit in with todays youth. The children and animals say ""Shut up"" while the dwarfs pipe up with ""Ya gotta be kidding."" It is clear that this script was not from the book and was from someone else's work not Lewis's.Peter and Caspian are not the noble characters impacted by their experience and worthy of leading the Narnians. Peter starts off the film as a whining young man, a mere imitation of the young man we saw in the first film. Peter has little growth from that point never showing any consideration of growth. In fact by the end of the film there is no love for Peter or belief that he is a high King. Caspian is not much better. Caspian lacks humility and any true endearing quality until the end of the film when he admits he feels unworthy to lead (one of the few lines from the book). This moment comes far to late for us to believe there is anything genuine behind it.The romance between Caspian and Susan is so forced it becomes painful at times. The entire love aspect adds nothing to the characters and merely adds grown factor to poor character development.Attempts are made at creating drama over the four kids sudden disappearance from Narnia but there is no follow through. Several things have this half thought out feel to them making you wonder if the writers felt Lewis didn't know how to write about characters.One of the biggest issues is that the lynch-pin for the entire Narnia series is missing for most of the film, Aslan. Aslan is never really referenced through out the first two thirds of the film. The Narnias never mention him or even recognize that he is the major influence for their entire nation. There is a hint at the situation from the book in which the children deal with the fact that only Lucy can see him but what Lewis used to show growth and a major issue of the children's growth in this story is blown over and turned into a three minute trek and dream sequence.One of my biggest problems is when Lucy tells Peter that a possible reason that Aslan has not appeared is that he is seeing if they are worthy of him showing up. I was very angry at this statement because if there is one thing the first movie showed us and the books make clear it was that Aslan worked for those he cared for, not because of their deeds but because of who he is. Aslan was treated poorly and we lost all sight of the great lion who was loved as a great leader and king from the first film.All in all I think this film suffers from some one else writing the story they think should have been done, not interpreting the story that was written.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
182,kim_smoak,"Horrible interpretation of book, but amazing movie!",9,21 December 2010,"People ask me all the timewhy did critics hate this movie? I honestly can't tell you what these critics are thinkingthough I think it would be pretty cool to read minds. I only can tell you my opinion of the MOVIE. The movie itself was beautiful, almost a work of art. The storyline was captivating, and the effects were realistic. The movie compared to the book, however, was a bit of a disappointment for some people. I honestly enjoyed the movie better than the book, mainly because there was more action in the movie than there was in the book.For those conservative fans out there that love the books, you will not like this movie. Prince Caspian is suppose to be a young boy, who is not ready to be crowned kingand that is the main reason why he had not been crowned king. The movie, however, had a handsome young man play the role of Prince Caspian, making him (in my eyes) in his early 20's. People were extremely disappointed in that fact, and did not understand why a 20 year old young man wasn't already crowned kingwouldn't he be ready by then? It's a very valid question. Overall, the movie was a success in my eyes, and I do give it four in a half stars out of five stars. I'm one of those rare people who can read the book, and watch a movieand critique both separately without comparing it to the other.For daily movie reviews visit: http://kimsmoak.com/",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

184,pp312,Hopelessly confused.,2,8 January 2019,"I'm hoping someone can help me out with this movie, as I'm hopelessly confused. To begin, we find Prince Caspian in his castle surrounded by evil Tellamarines (or whatever). We see him lying on his bed studying a book about the Pevensie children, the kings and queens of Narnia. We see an illustration of the children in the book. Then Caspian escapes the castle and--presumably--goes on a quest to summon the children to save Narnia. The Pevensies of course are already in Narnia and we see them wandering along chatting amiably. Next thing Caspian jumps out from behind a tree (which wasn't there before) and tries to kill Peter, who just manages to deflect the blow in time. Er...what's going on here? Caspian is looking for 4 children--check. Here are 4 children--check. They look just like the illustration he left on his bed in the castle--check. So what does he do? He hides behind a tree and tries to kill one of them. He clearly doesn't recognise them, even though they closely resemble...well, you get the idea. He doesn't call out and ask who they are, as any sane person would. Being a man of honour, and the hero, he hides behind a tree with murderous intent. Is this how heroes usually act, or am I expecting too much? Frankly, I think someone missed the boat with this movie.

185,jordathan,More Hits Than Misses,7,16 May 2008,"""The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian"" is definitely an adaptation of the beloved children's novel by C.S. Lewis. as a huge fan of both Lewis and cinema, for me, this is both a good thing and a bad thing.the book upon which it is based is arguably the worst book of the seven-part Narnia series, and is undoubtedly a difficult book to adapt into film as Lewis spends pages and pages talking about sights and sounds that have nothing to do with the actual plot. the first 45 minutes of the film are oddly paced and the cumbersome work of adapting the book shows. the script rushes over some aspects that I think are rather important, such as the personality of Trumpkin the Dwarf, and a new fan might wish they had a copy of the book to consult at times. at other moments, the film dwells too much on subplots that have little relevance to the main themes, including an invented romance plot between Caspian and Susan which is never even hinted at in the book. also, they try to weave in too many spiritual messages that simply are not in the book, as Lewis based Caspian more on pagan mythology than Gospel theology.there are many successful changes, however. the storming of Miraz's castle, though not in the book, is a fantastic sequence. the liberties taken with making Caspian older than in the book is also forgiven as Ben Barnes turns in a great performance. i was also a fan of the imperial Spanish-based culture given to the Telmarines. the film excels the first in its scope and production value, the sets and costumes are astonishing and the visuals are nothing short of spectacular. the Battle of Beruna is a breathtaking affair, wonderfully realized by Adamson and Co.the film missteps at times, no doubt, and lacks the emotional punch of its predecessor, but is still very entertaining and a worthy sequel, though a step below LWW. i feel it's a good set up for ""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader,"" which is a book heavier on action than on plot. all in all, a good film, but not a great film.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
186,Fritz_Gerlich,Boring,3,25 May 2008,"With this kind of movie you know the ending before going to see it so there is no tension or suspense there. The fun with these kinds of movies is in the interesting characters, funny dialog, cool cgi action sequences, and story that that is interesting. The characters here are completely one dimensional played woodenly by the actors. They are horribly dull. The dialog is virtually without except for the sword-fighting mouse, but that character was just a rip off of the cat from shriek 3. The cgi is pedestrian, the creatures are dull and unimaginative. The action sequences are also boring and overlong. And the producers have basically gutted the Lewis books, and substituted their own story, which is silly even for a cartoony kids movie and not at all interesting.Anyway, at 224 minutes, this film is bloated boring and unfunny.

187,BettyChampagne,Great for children under 5,2,25 May 2008,"I never read the Narnia books, but after seeing the second Narnia movie this weekend, I don't think i will ever see another Narnia movie again.I was not a big fan of the first movie, the elf creature was creepy and the talking beavers just put me right off (beavers meant to be seen, not heard), but after suffering through Caspian this weekend, i now feel the first movie is a masterpiece! Caspian starts out interestingly enough. After the children arrive back in Narnia, there are a few scenes that invoke wonderment and awe as we see the current state of things in Narnia. However the the wonderment wheres off quickly as the movie plods along and the story unfolds.I won't spoil the story (or lack of one), but i will say that the plot is unoriginal and uninspiring. The acting ranges from campy over acting (such as the taking mouse/rat) to statedly incompetent (as in all four of the children).Towards the end the movie actually goes a little haywire and the plot twist is ridiculous at best... As a matter of fact, if someone had just taken a ride into the woods, this movie could have been ended in the first 15 minutes.The FX aren't that special. The dialog is lame, the plot is stupid and the acting is brutal!!! This is one Caspian that should be suck to the bottom of the sea... wink:)PS/ did i mention that Prince Caspian has some kind of flirtatious relationship with Susan... the fat, bitchy sister! talk about a boner killer! She goes through the entire movie looking uncomfortable and constipated... come to think of it, i never did see any indoor plumbing in Narnia!

188,Darkfrog24,Flawed and ill-paced but worth it just for one scene:,4,28 May 2008,"I saw Prince Caspian. I haven't seen the recent LWW. I was surprised by the quality. It was lower than I'd expected. The pacing was iffy almost until the end. The writing was okay, but it could have been so much better so easily. To toss out an example, there is a scene in which Caspian leads the four into a cave and asks ""Don't you know where you are?"" Well, the ""where they were"" of it would have been much cooler if we'd panned back to see it right away. Caspian himself seems to jump between knowing nothing and knowing everything. We don't get a real lay of the land of how many Narnians are left and why anyone thinks there are enough. More importantly, I was expecting more of a redemption for Peter by the end because, by the end, Peter does need to be redeemed.Still the tension and the ""Who abandoned Narnia and made you king?"" between Peter and Caspian was pretty good, and I did like what they did with Susan. It anticipates her final destiny without being too blatant or giving anything away. But mostly, I missed ordinary Telmorenes. I liked the way they played Miras's lords, scheming but not as bad as he was, but I missed the running through the villages with the Maenads. I had particularly hoped for the part where they pick up the students in one place and the teacher in the other. Oh wait... I think that might have been in book seven. Nope, it was this one. Crumbs. And don't get me started on what they did to Reepacheep! Oh wait... they absolutely nailed Reepacheep. Non-crumbs.In short, even with its flaws, the whole movie, every frame of it, is worth the ticket and would be even if it were far worse: They kept the scene in which someone recommends resurrecting the White Witch.

189,lual,Shoot 'em up with bows and arrows,6,6 August 2008,"I read The Chronicles of Narnia when I was about twelve years old. The series is not as well-known in Germany, but after watching the first season of the BBC-production I thought it looked interesting and gradually I read all books of the series. I enjoyed them but there was a lot that bothered me about them as well so I never read them again. At the time I didn't pick up any Christian allegory and when I read about all the Christian fuss that was made over the production of the first film I was wondering what everybody was talking about. I did some research then and read a lot about it and I understand it now but I still think that, especially as a child, you can read the books without thinking about the allegory at all. But now I finally understood what it was that I never liked about the books: All characters are basically paralyzed. Everybody is constantly talking about Aslan who will come and set things straight, even though he is never there when they need him. This glorification of a talking lion seemed too ridiculous to me and in my opinion no character in these books was allowed to have a free will.Enough about the books, I am here to talk about the movie, I just wanted to get this out of the way for you to understand where I am coming from.Honestly, in a visual sense, the movie is great, there are certain things, such as the spirit that is formed out of petals, that look so real that even though you know it is CGI it doesn't look like CGI. The animals look pretty real as well. But there are still many things, such as the river-god, that may look cool but still look a lot like CGI. All in all, the technical side of the movie is probably as good as it could be, except for Caspian's hairstyle. Seriously, after running around the forests for days without a bath or so he still sports a perfectly designed parting in the hair that looks as if it has been cast in concrete.The acting is OK. Nothing really great but everybody delivers what is required of him or her. The only exception is William Moseley, who is still rather bland and boring. But this may also be due to the role he plays. After all, a kid who is designed as a natural leader with his brother and sisters looking up to him because he usually acts in noble and sensible ways can only be boring, right? Anna Popplewell has improved considerably since the first movie.The movie is too long and a lot could have been tightened up. Curiously, it is the changes to the story that could have used some elaboration:-There seems to be no reason why Peter is suddenly arrogant. And also, even though he just as suddenly goes through a change due to the tragical effects his decisions have led to this is never really addressed in the script. -The rivalry between Peter and Caspian also ends abruptly without the two of them having any exchange about it. - There is obviously some sort of attraction between Susan and Caspian. I understand that the producers did not want to make it two obvious, but really, exchanging 2 or three glances throughout the movie does not justify the emotional good-bye they share at the end.All of these additions were interesting ideas but all of them were executed poorly in my opinion. Even though I was entertained throughout the movie there was one element that really spoiled it for me. I understand that ""Prince Caspian"" is supposed to be darker and more mature than the ""The Lion, the witch and the wardrobe"" and I don't mind violence per se. But what I really object to is the way the violence is reduced to a gimmick throughout the movie due to the American rating system. I am not talking about the big battle sequences, the siege of the castle (even though this was not in the book) and the battle in the end, but about all the violence that occurs throughout the movie.Appently, the American rating system approves of violence in children's movies if no blood is shown. By looking at this movie, one gets the impression that any kind of violence is excused as long as there is no blood. And so, throughout the movie, bad guys are slain with swords or killed with arrows by the kids, but everything is fine since there is no blood.This is really like a Shoot 'em up pc-game where the baddies die as soon as they are hit and nobody has to think about them any more. Hey, in this movie, the characters even supposedly die after their legs have been sliced (without blood) by a sword-carrying-mouse. This really happens throughout the entire movie, there is barely a scene where no violence of this kind occurs. I think it is wrong to show violence without consequence. I don't mind having kids (or anybody) exposed to violence if it is not overly gruesome, but I think the filmmakers have the responsibility of showing the consequences. If the filmmakers weren't so bound by the rating system, the body-count would ironically probably have been a lot lower since many characters would probably rather have been wounded than just killed off. This kind of hypocrisy has been bothering me about movies that had to be toned down so that they can be seen by the entire family for a long time, but here it really becomes apparent. Considering that this is a movie which is supposed to have a Christian message, I find it especially irritating that none of the good guys have any qualms about killing the bad guys by the dozens.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
190,Vash_ebas,"Pretty good, worth seeing",9,1 June 2008,"I love all the Narnia books and I loved the first Narnia movie. So I was determined to see this one. I love watching those Pevensie kids, and they were great. The sets, the landscapes, the talking animals and other creatures were great, particularly Reepicheep the mouse. I wish this had been as true to the book as the first one was. The romance between Caspian and Susan was totally uncalled for (too much Hollywood). The battles were too long to hold my interest, although technically they were well done. Ben Barnes was good as Prince Caspian. Somehow I did not enjoy this as much as the first Narnia movie. May be my expectations were too high, or because I knew the story? When I saw the first one, I did not know the story.Overall a pretty good movie, definitely worth seeing. Just not as good as the first one, but it has made me hungry again for more Narnia movies.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
191,RockBiter,Not Quite There,7,19 May 2008,"After waiting patiently for 2 and a half years after LWW, I confess I am a little disappointed by PC. On a very broad, general level I am seeing and feeling that Andrew Adamson's devotion to the works of CS Lewis is not on a par with, say, Peter Jackson's devotion to those of JRR Tolkien. He is beginning to exhibit a willingness to keep his visual story of Narnia on a well-trodden plane.What I mean is this: - there is an overabundance and over-dependence on what film-raters call ""fantasy battle sequences"" or ""fantasy violence"". These sequences have tremendous action and a lot of awe-inspiring visuals but do not add a jot to the story by BEING so. I realize that the unfortunate reality of today's viewers especially younger viewers is the necessity of these sequences because they've 'already seen it before'. Adamson is feeling the need to deliver in this area more than in LWW and it is a distraction.Other problems were the adding of parts that were not in the book. I realize that there is always a bit of artistic/directorial licence in films but one particular difference is detrimental to the actual story. The initial assault by the Pevensies and Caspian and the Old Narnians against Miraz's castle was one of the above-noted scenes which caused a lot of killing off on both sides and which then sent us right back to where we were before it happened. We already know that Miraz is a bad guy and the story went nowhere in the mean-time.Also, Miraz's assassins did not kill him after his single combat with Peter only to continue the war but in order to bring peace with Caspian and the Old Narnians. The war was too long.Finally and worst of all, Aslan's coming was so late and his actions so few that he was almost an after-thought.However, there were some notable highlights:The Pevensies discovering and exploring the ruins of old Cair Paravel (including the part where Lucy, in a final inspiration of where they actually are, has them all stand in order on the sites of their crumbled thrones) In that moment they became kings and queens again and I truly got chills!Caspian's ride to safety in the forestPeter Dinklage's comedic, wry TrumpkinWarwick Davis's zealous, foolhardy Nikabrik the sheer scale of the building of the bridge over Berunna by Miraz's troops (this was truly awesome)Lucy's entire dream sequence (perhaps my favourite scene in the whole movie)Aslan's How and its layoutthe werewolf and hag in cahoots, trying to get Caspian to free the White Witch from her ice prisonEdmund's driving his sword through her middle from behind and shattering the prisonthe collapsing of the ground under the Telmarine cavalry before the How",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
192,kitsilanoca-1,C.S. Lewis Would Be Proud,9,30 May 2008,"Like a kid of eleven I counted the days till this film came out, and walked into the threatre expecting an action picture, and got just what I expected and more. This was an even better film than The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe - some of the wrinkles in the CGI in the first ironed out, and chock-a-block-full of exciting and emotional scenes. I think the producer, director, film and CGI crews did a terrific job, and that the cast really put their hearts into making their characters believable; I look forward to seeing Ben Barnes play Caspian again, while Georgie Henley and Skandar Keynes will be a delight to watch once more. I will definitely miss Anna Popplewell and William Moseley, but expect we will see them again if The Horse and His Boy and The Last Battle are made in a few years time.People should also be aware that Lewis's stepson, Douglas Gresham, was co-producer of this film as well as the last one. The Chronicles were amongst his favourite books when he was a child, and I have no doubt he had a say in what his stepfather would and wouldn't have liked done to the storyline in the film.Since the book (which I first read 34 years ago) is a bit slow in places (my friend's daughter found it a bit boring when she had it read to her), so I expected the story would have to be filled out, which it was, but the original storyline was kept to faithfully. I think my favourite scene in the whole film was at the beginning at the Tube station, when the Pevensie children are drawn back into Narnia. Wonderfully awe-inspiring and magical even for a 45 year old! The book is about the fight to reclaim Narnia from the Telmarines, so I was rather surprised at some film critic's reviews I read which said that there were too many battle scenes. Others bemoaned how it was too much like Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings. Did they not know that Rowling was greatly influenced by Lewis's writing? Who came first? Also Tolkien was a very close friend and contemporary of Lewis's, and attended Oxford with him. I got a very strong impression that many critics have never read the books, haven't learned anything about the writer, or maybe even saw the film. The latter conclusion is from seeing so many borrowed sentences and paragraphs from others in their reviews, that it gave me the feeling that they have a hard job doing what they're supposed to do: write an independent opinion on a film. Why did they go to journalism school in the first place? I was also wondering why they were disappointed in the darker and more violent side in some of the scenes in this film. Here's something from the book, Prince Caspian: A dull, grey voice at which Peter's flesh crept replied, ""I'm hunger. I'm thirst. Where I bite, I hold till I die, and even after death they must cut out my mouthful from my enemy's body and bury it with me. I can fast a hundred years and not die. I can lie a hundred nights on the ice and not freeze. I can drink a river of blood and not burst. Show me your enemies."" That line was used in the most frightening scene, I thought, in the film. Here's another: Peter swung to face Sopesian, slashed his legs from under him and, with the back-cut of the same stroke, walloped off his head.I think a book with a graphic scene - for children's literature - like that in it can only be expected to have a darker tone to it when made into a film. Actually in the film they deleted that scene and replace it with Sopesian being snatched away by the root of one of the trees that arrived late at the battle to save the day.So many simple lines were brought to life in this film such as: And imagine that the wood, instead of being fixed to one place, was rushing at you; and no longer trees but huge people; yet still trees because their long arms waved like branches and their heads tossed and leaves fell round them in showers.A masterpiece! I am looking forward to seeing The Voyage of the Dawn Treader in 2010.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
193,swissmanager,Highly entertaining and enjoyable !,9,13 June 2008,"Well I never saw the first Narnia in the cinema, and, anyway, missed the opening on the telly, so I can not really compare between the first and the second films. But, from what I saw tonight in the cinema, I reckon that this sequel is equal to, if not better than, the first film.Its a great film for both kids and adults to watch in the cinema. Fast moving, plenty of action, good visual effects, great scenery and quite a few pleasantly amusing quips by the enchanting cast. The story-line is absolutely implausible but who cares - the power balance swings constantly from the goodies to the baddies and back again, making the whole film a well-worth experience.Maybe I am being slightly over-generous in my rating, an 8.5 would be more realistic, but I just happened to be in the mood for it and for me the film really clicked.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
194,bala08,pathetic to the core,1,30 May 2008,"Right from the word go the movie sucks to the core. Its like copy pasting from every other fantasy fairytale movie out there. I'm shocked to see this movie has a rating as high as this.Also if anyone even thinks to talk about the special efx in this movie, please get in touch with me, all are stale stuffs done already in million other movies using softwares like 3ds max.The last scene (crossing the bridge) was the biggest joke of all, the river itself is only about knee high deep and they have a bridge on top of it and if it isn't for that bridge, no one could get past? And while they are at it, the water rising special efx was already done in LOTR 1st part and it didn't get any better here.At any point of the movie, you just get to see a bunch of people doing this or that and the last battle scene looks so obvious that the soldiers are all manipulated using cg efx.The whole plot was so sick with horrible attempts to humour the audience. probably it just cost them a few thousand dollars to make this movie and maybe they are paying the theaters to run this.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
195,krissikrissa,The second visit to Narnia isn't as magical as the first one.,3,24 July 2010,"I am one of the many people who thought the first Narnia movie to be a pretty good entertainment. She was colourful, well directed and too a certain point charming. Of course it was a bit of a light version of the Lord of the Rings or maybe Harry Potter but i still enjoyed it quite a bit.Prince Caspian comes in trying to be more grown up and interestingly enough that makes it just more childish. The characters try to be interesting and lively on screen but while trying they just become silly, and with a cast like that there's not a lot to expect. The chains of events are much faster then in the earlier one and for me that kind of ruined the mystic feeling that came with the first one. The look is beautiful and flawless in its design but that was not something that could save it from ultimately failing miserably.Prince Caspian is not in the same league as the first one in any way, she's worse in nearly every way. There are no real charms in this one and that fantasy feeling is kind of missing the whole time. Like i said before, this film tries to be more mature and one way is by building a look similar to the middle ages wars and it doesn't work and rather comes out more childish then the earlier one. The young cast seemed jaded the whole way through and to me they were just plain irritating. Ben Barnes is the only one who does something right here as Prince Caspian but even so, it's not something groundbreaking.Otherwise the movie just flows without nothing significant happening, the humour fails mostly and are more pointed to the younger generation. The closing scenes left you feeling kind of silly and in a bad mood.I couldn't wait until the movie was over and i am really disappointed because like i said i was a fan of the first one but here they take a misstep..................a huge one.3/10",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
196,Tokugawa,Even More Fun Than the First - a Winner!,10,16 May 2008,"Saw it today.As good as the previous one, and just as moving.Narnia has been taken over for several generations by a foreign human people who have settled there, the Telmarine. Prince Caspian's father, the king, has been killed and the uncle is the usurper. (Can you say ""Hamlet""?!). Caspian is on the lam. Lucy, Edmund, Peter, and Susan are summoned to help by the prince's horn as they are needed. Caspian is found hiding out underground with the Narnians whom the Telmarines thought were extinct.Alliances were formed with talking animals and various creatures, even some dwarfs and minotaurs previously allied to the White Witch--all oppose the foreigners in Narnia. Various exploits and battles ensue.Aslan shows up briefly later in the film. The White Witch even has a brief scene.This film is much less allegorical than the first, with much less sibling discord among the four English youngsters--Peter, Edmund, Lucy and Susan. They are all far more self-assured. especially Edmund.Action sequences are top notch, and it seems they used fewer digital ""people"" than Lord of the Rings, which was OK: if you saw a cavalryman in the distance it was a real man and horse.Prince Caspian, interestingly, several times was a real screw-up, Peter and Edmund basically saved his throne for him. At least Aslan showed confidence in him.What was oddest was that although this film was made in New Zealand (as usual!), Slovenia, and Poland, all the Telmarines looked and sounded Spanish! ??? They all had Spanish accents, and even Caspian, played by Ben Barnes (born in London) spoke with a Spanish accent. The Italian actor who played Miraz said that the director wanted such an accent from all Telmarines.Best new talking animals: Trufflehunter (badger), and Reepicheep (sword wielding mouse with attitude).As others have said, ""The new Narnia can be seen as a parallel to the modern world, in which old beliefs are scoffed at. ""Who believes in Aslan nowadays?"" asks Trumpkin (dwarf) when he first meets Caspian. Those who ""hold on"", like the badgers, are praised: this links with Lewis's views on religious faith"".I can't say more about this film without giving away spoilers. But it was top notch.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
197,connorveenstra,Underrated masterpiece of fantasy.,10,15 September 2017,"If that sounds like an exaggeration, be rest assured that it isn't. Despite the overwhelming amount of negativity aimed towards this film by fans of the book and the original film, Prince Caspian is a worthy sequel to the first film and even an improvement on its source material.For a sequel perspective this does everything right. It raises the stakes, which gives the film a much darker edge, but in a mature way. The themes are also more mature, touching on aspects of faith, doubt, pride and revenge, which are all maturely explored without being too intense for children. The character arcs for everybody involved are excellent, unlike the first movie where they were introduced and then just kind of dropped. The acting is much better this time around and the set and costume design continue to be on point.In terms of adaptation, even though it doesn't exactly stay true to the source material, I think it improves on it. All of the Pevense children, Prince Caspian and the rest of the cast are given definable personalities, as opposed to the book characters which were just self- inserts for children. The film has a surprising amount of interesting world building jumping off from the book, with the original Kings and Queens and even Aslan falling into myth and legend in this new Narnia.I'm really sticking up for this one because I think it gets too much flack in general. With its mature themes, excellent battle scenes, flawless set design and fascinating world building, this is up there with the best of what Lord of the Rings or even Game of Thrones have to offer. Give it a chance.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
198,alexmail-2,Absolutely Incredible,10,17 May 2008,"I came into this movie expecting a fantasy film with a couple of cool battle sequences, and some boring dialog. LWW was good, but Prince Caspian is a humongous improvement on it. The movie is really well paced. The movie starts off with tension, and there is rarely a dull moment. You might have three or four minutes of dialog, but after that the tension is high. The kids are much better acting wise, and their chemistry is a lot better. Peter is arrogant, Susan is indecisive, and you really don't see any character flaws in Lucy or Edmund in this one. Trumpkin is a really interesting character, and has some good lines. I was surprised by how good Ben Barnes was as Caspian. Liam Neeson, was well... Liam Neeson, excellent. This movie wasn't just one big plot. There were several subplots that they delved into. For instance there is a whole Political side to the movie. There is a relationship between Susan and Caspian (which is not in the book). They show how Peter misses being an adult, and won't accept that he's a kid. They go into how Susan really doesn't want to have any romances. They go into the superb relationship between Aslan, and Lucy. They show individual Centaur's relationships with other centaurs. The movie really has lots of sides to it. The scenery in Prince Caspian is breathtaking, and it is mostly not CG scenery. There is one scene when they're in a river, and you can see through the water, because it's so clear.The animation is very realistic, except for the water monster at the end. All the creatures especially the mouses are beautifully done. The animation in the battles is very good. There is one part where CG horses are dying and it reminds me of LOTR. The battles are the best part of the movie. They are epic to say the least. When they invade Miraz's castle the battle is really spectacular, and reminds me a lot of Helms Deep from LOTR. There are lots of short sword fights in the movie, but there is one really great one. Peter and Miraz duel it out. The duel was really well done, and didn't get repetitive. The final battle at the end was really intense. No lie, a kid sitting next to me was literally on the edge of his seat during the final battle. Prince Caspian is without a doubt the best fantasy movie since LOTR The Return of the King. The battles were great, the story was easy to follow, and it was appropriate for kids over seven. Disney has another gold mine on their hands. This movie is going to do so well. My dad saw it and he hates fantasy, but he loved it. Make sure to see this it is really awesome. Best fantasy movie in five years.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
199,Mattissimplythebest,A definite improvement on the first film,7,8 July 2008,"Prince Caspian the film is firstly not like the book - shocking I know - and for those that have read the book you will notice the scale and number of battles involved in the film have increased beyond the written word.So, placing the book to one side for a moment I had a thoroughly enjoyable encounter with this film; the action was much improved as was the pacing, all around the acting level had gone up a notch or two perhaps in a similar manner to the Harry Potter films (between films two and three that is). And though erring fairly heavily on the side of sweet instead of bitter in the end I think the heart of the book survives fairly well.Personally I would like to think this represents another bench mark in the franchise which will hopefully bring about a really great experience once the Dawntreader has been made; this was not a great film but it had its moments and that is why I remain hopeful for better things in the future.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
200,Heffernan99,Fabulous special effects,7,10 August 2013,"1,300 years in Narnia has passed when the Pevensie siblings were living in the real world for only 1 year. Contrary to their expectations, Narnia has changed a lot from what they last knew it to be. The Telmarines are a non-magical, human race that have put the Narnians on the verge of extinction with most of them assuming that they are already extinct. A Telmarine Lord, Lord Miraz (Castellitto) is the brother of the King of Telmar whom he killed along with all his sons, save Prince Caspian (Barnes). Now that Lord Miraz has a newborn heir, he intends to get rid of Caspian and hence pronounce himself the King of Telmar. Caspian escapes Telmar and in an act of desperation, summons the Queens and Kings of Old, the Pevensie siblings. Aslan (Neeson) has not returned and the Telmarines intend to attack the Narnians and Prince Caspian and wipe them out once and for all. The movie is a large improvement from the previous movie on multiple fronts. There is far more action, adventure and anticipation than before and the useless and immature dialogues have been thrown for something more mature and needful. It's a wholesome, entertaining fantasy- war movie that young and old can enjoy and relate to alike.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
201,dandebs,PC far better than LWW,8,7 June 2008,"Saw it last night - thought it was MUCH better than LWW, mainly because they figured out who was the hero in Prince Caspian....In every book in Narnia the hero is Aslan. Although he is not the focus of the story, his presence infuses each book, and he is in control of all that happens (not surprisingly, as he is Narnia's version of Jesus).They missed that simple point in LWW, which weakened the story considerably, and made the sudden transformation of the children into great warriors very stilted and unbelievable. In the book it's clear that they are transformed through Aslan breathing on them, imparting his power to them to do what they were called to do.PC is about a crisis of faith - at each step of the way the question is whether they will trust Aslan, or just do their own thing (maybe even ask the white witch for help).So I thought the story was much truer to the spirit of the book (although not the letter of the book).Additionally, the director has a much steadier hand in this one - I felt in LWW he was feeling his way somewhat - in PC he knows what he wants, and makes it happen. (Director is the same guy who directed Shrek!) The special effects were also superb, particularly the naiads and dryads (trees), and the water god at the end. This one is going in my DVD collection.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
202,dottyjyoung,"Excellent ideas, bad follow-through.",6,16 May 2008,"Prince Caspian has to be one of the most difficult of the Narnia books to translate onto the screen. The first several chapters involve walking around in the woods, lots of talking, an extended flashback, and 1300 years of history to cover. Therefore, I cannot criticize the writers for deviating from the story. In fact, I have to give them credit: their **ideas** for re-inventing Prince Caspian were phenomenal.The execution of those ideas could have been much, much better.When we begin, we see that Peter is struggling with re-adjusting to life as an English schoolboy after being a Narnian king. (beautiful idea!) We see him trying to prove himself to his schoolmates and acting out his aggression on some poor soul who bumped him. We later see him challenging Caspian publicly, refusing to wait for Aslan, acting as the Narnain leader himself, failing miserably in battle (and it was a beautifully choreographed battle), spilling buckets of Narnian blood..............and then what happens? Well, he still doesn't wait for Aslan, and he still acts as the Narnian leader, and he's nearly sucked into Jadis' temptation, and he **never once has a turn-around moment.** The writers *almost* gave him one, then Lucy is given the lame line of ""Maybe Aslan is waiting for us to prove ourselves."" Isn't that what Peter has been doing all along? There was no turning point/redemption/learning curve to this character. Now, since he can't come back to Narnia, he will never have one.True, he did hand over his sword at the end and say, ""We're not needed here anymore."" But after the level of conflict and tension that the movie had developed, that scene had all the effect of someone telling a toddler, ""You have to share your toys."" Caspian is simply never given a chance to be anything other than confused in this movie. He has very little character development. While he is allowed to be merciful, he's never allowed to grow into a king.Susan was given a great reason to become bitter against Narnia in future movies, so her character was at least given a great set-up. Other than that, she said and did very little.Why was Lucy riding into the forest? Did they think she could summon Aslan? Wake the trees? Find more Narnians? Well, we *were* lucky that Aslan showed up, like Athena on a rope and pulley, to save the day just in time. :( All-in-all, I was disappointed. I was *thrilled* that the writers had come up with good ideas for adapting the book to the screen. But if they'd spent half as much time developing these story lines as the visual guys did developing the River-god or the gryphons, then it could have been a great movie. As it was, it gets a C+ at best.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
203,aurelius-13,Horibble. Just Absolutely horrible!,1,14 June 2008,"Spoilers: Absolutely awful and dreadful! I only watched it because of my friends. The whole film is just completely copyrighted from Harry Potter and the Lord of the Rings. The fat guy with a beard looks like Dumbledore. The castle in the beginning is a complete rip-off of Harry Potter. I can't believe it though, the story was made in the thirties, but the film is showing copyrights of everything. The characters, the dialogue, the settings, the clichés, all of these qualities have ruin the movie for me. The girl and the prince's love scene is shallow. They don't enough romance between the two characters. The ice villain from the last movie returns, and I thought that was okay, still kind of shallow. There are a few jokes from the dwarf and the rat, but most of them are sort of lame. The four main characters are really a misery to watch. They are just bad actors: their facial expressions, their movement, their reactions, and their mannerisms. I don't know why the director decided to choose these four, unless the four are actually related and they are the director's children/grandchildren. Like the part when the little girl talks to this 'Narnian' bear, but it turns out that the bear is a savage creature. The bear hunts her down viciously, but the girl just stares. She doesn't yell, feint, or anything. The only thing worth to watch barely is the fight scene at the end, especially the part when the trees come to life and massacre the enemies, aka The Lord of the Rings. The only funny characters is a bloody-talking rat and a dwarf who looks constantly high from weed. That's all the artist points in this movie. I am telling you, you are not going to enjoy unless you are a C.S Lewis fan, a Chronicles of Narnia fan, or a strong Christian believer. Don't watch this movie!",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
204,thetimegivenus,"Not as Good as the Other Two, But Still a Good Film",7,8 January 2011,"I went into this film with really low expectations. Almost every person I have spoken to about it said it was a disappointment. But, being a big Narnia fan, I decided to brave Prince Caspian anyway. I'm not disappointed that I did. I'm not saying it is a great film, since it certainly has problems, but overall I found the second installment of the Narnia series to be an enjoyable experience.Most of the time, that is. Other times, I thought that Andrew Adamson had been watching too much of The Lord of the Rings.The Story: Prince Caspian is on the run from his uncle, who is trying to steal his throne. When Caspian falls in with the old Narnians, he thinks he is about to be killed, so he blows on Queen Susan's magical horn, summoning the four Penvensie children back to Narnia. Under the leadership of the kings and queens of old, the Narnians unite to win back their freedom from the cruel reign of the Telmarines.The Good: As usual the film has excellent themes of sacrificial love. Characters frequently put themselves in danger to save others and some even go to the point of sacrificing their lives for their friends. But the biggest theme in this movie is far deeper than that. Throughout the film, the heroes talk about proving themselves to Aslan and how they have to do all the work this time. Every time they try this though, things go wrong, men are killed, and battles are lost. Finally they realize that they cannot succeed alone, and that they need Aslan's help for all of life. It's a powerful metaphor, and one I am thankful they included.I am also very pleased with how the film handled magic. In the book, 'white magic*' is used several times and is not portrayed as being evil. In the film, however, none of the heroes use magic and the one time magic does appear it is portrayed as obviously evil.The Bad: Women in combat was the big one. Susan fights right up front with the guys, dispatching Telmarines with her bow in classic Legolas style. There are also several female centaurs who can be seen charging into battle. Other negative elements include a bit of immodesty and a completely unnecessary kiss between Caspian and Susan.Also, while this film is darker and more violent than the other two, it contains less scary creatures than either of the others. the violence is mostly bloodless, but the battles are large and intense, though not on the scale of The Lord of the Rings.Conclusion: While this film is not as inspiring as the others in the series, I still found it to be an enjoyable addition to the Chronicles of Narnia. I can't wait to see where they take us in the future.Footnotes: * By using the term 'white magic' I'm not trying to imply that there are different types of magic. All magic is evil, whether it is called white or black. The term 'white magic' in the context of this review is only used to imply that the magic is being wielded by a character usually portrayed as good.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
205,msloane1,Prince Caspian not King of the Narnia Movies,4,6 January 2015,"Let me say up front that I am an atheist and a secularist and as such I don't care about any religious undertones or allegory that this series may possess. I'm judging this movie based on the book to movie transition and the movie as a fantasy film.Prince Caspian is easily the weakest and least enjoyable of the Narnia movies. While the Narnia series is nowhere near as good as Harry Potter or the Middle Earth trilogies both The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe and The Voyage of the Dawn Treader are pretty good movies in their own right. But Prince Caspian suffers from numerous flaws. Let's start with faithfulness to the book. Well plot wise this movie is reasonably faithful to the book. But the problem is the characters. The way several key characters is portrayed is so different from the book that they feel like totally different characters. By far the biggest problem is Peter. The Peter of the book is noble, humble, and kingly and truly deserves the title and position of High King of Narnia. The Peter in this movie is a jerk, whiny, and worst of all, arrogant. This is such a complete misrepresentation of the character that he didn't feel like Peter at all. A similar problem exists on a smaller scale with regard to Caspain himself. Caspian being older in the movie than in the book is a minor flaw. But a much bigger issue is the relationship between Peter and Caspian. In the book there is respect on both sides and Peter even says""I have come not to take your place but to put you in it."" This movie depicts palpable tension between Peter and Caspian when there is NO hint of tension between them in the book. A smaller but still annoying issue is that retarded romance between Susan and Caspian. I happen not to be a fan of the romance genre anyway but there is no hint of this in the book either. It seems as though a romance element was added to attract the Twilight/Hunger Games audiences because not only is this not in the book but even within the context of the movie it serves no plot purpose. Plot wise and event wise this movie is fairly faithful to the book but the character portrayals mostly suck. The acting and casting are tough to fairly evaluate here. Georgie is her usual splendid self in her portrayal of Lucy and Liam Neeson is awesome as the voice of Aslan. But William's and Ben's performances are tough to judge. The poor character writing in the script would make it tough to appreciate even good quality acting in those roles. Then there's the pacing. The battle scenes are too long and drawn out leading to a movie that seems to drag. There was a time when I watched this movie after having not seen it for a while when I found myself saying it was better than I remembered. Here's the thing: This movie has a good story to tell and tells it reasonably well but because the battle scenes are so long and loud they tend to dominate the mind's memory of this movie. A better movie would have been produced by simply reducing the length and intensity of some battle scenes. The best part of this movie is its outstanding special effects and visuals. This is a very well made film that is awesome to look at. To address a common complaint: Many people have complained about the""bloodless"" nature of the battles in this movie. First, remember that this is fantasy. More importantly, bear in mind that the filmmakers were contractually obligated by the studio to achieve a rating no higher than PG. In fact one scene was altered to eliminate the possibility of implied beheading. In the scene in question the angle of a fallen soldier's helmet was changed to make clear that the helmet was empty and did not contain a severed head. The PG requirement necessities the lack of blood and gore. That said this is still pretty violent and should only be viewed by people in middle school or older. My opinion on this movie is mixed leaning negative. The reason I lean negative is that some of the positive attributes of this movie are damaged by the negative attributes. Faithfulness to the book: 4 out of 10. Casting/Acting: 7 out of 10. Pacing: 3 out of 10. Special effects/visuals: 9 out of 10. Overall: 4 out of 10.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

I make it sound exciting by adding an exclamation mark at the end of a sentence but, honestly, it's quite drab to say the least.Prince Caspian, the follow up to the just as drab The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, takes us back to that amazing fantasy world of fauns, minotaurs, and terrible child acting of Narnia. Hey look! It's a talking badger! Let's all act like there nothing bizarre about it. Hey look! I'm 10 years old! Let's pretend I'm in my twenties and suped up on Ritalin and I'm falling in love with a dwarf in his 50s. There is nothing wrong with this at all! Let's pretend I like the movie... no wait, I can't. I really can't.I think the problem with this and the first is that they were trying to compete with Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter by placing the feel of the story somewhere in between. This story and the rest of the books by C.S. Lewis have nothing to do with being a serious journey into fantasy nor as a teen-angst riddled journey into revenge.

Of course, things sometimes change here and there, dialogs, scenes that are cut and everything, which is only natural.Then I read Prince Capsian and saw the movie and to be honest I didn't like the book much, however the film version certainly did stay true to the book but many things were changed and re-ordered, which was for the better to make it more entertaining. Overall its a good movie, there are a few things here and there that didn't feel so strong as with the first movie. But still, I feel its a good addition to the Narnia series, I only hope that Voyage of the Dawn Treader will be good.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
208,LinksPopcornPicks,"Not as Great as the First, but Still Very Good",9,8 August 2008,"-The first film in the ""Chronicles of Narnia"" series was ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"". While the LOTR franchise had been finished for a few years at the time of the release, fanboys(for those who don't give a crap about Harry Potter) had been thirsting for a good fantasy adventure movie. The first ""Chronicles of Narnia"" film was a hit. It hit all the right notes. Well casted, really nice special effects, and especially a fantastic story to begin with. While this sequel is a fine film, it doesn't make the homerun that the original made. -The Pevensie children return to Narnia. Why? Because Prince Caspian has called all the former kings and queens of Narnia to help him gain the throne from the evil Telemarines. The children have been gone for one year in the real world, which is 1300 years in Narnia time. -The main problem with this film is that the book ""Prince Caspian"" cannot live up to it's predecessor. Its as simple as that. Its not that it wasn't as well executed or the adaption wasn't as faithful to the book. Its just that the story that the movie was based off wasn't as interesting as the first. The Christian themes aren't as strong in this film either, but upon further research I have found the main one which the film mostly focuses on. Since the film takes place 1300 years later everyone has lost faith that Aslan is with them any longer or that he ever existed in the first place. This theme falls in to ""Does God exist?"". In the film only Lucy believes that Aslan might still be around, but even she doubts. -Besides the fact that ""Prince Caspian"" is not as magnificent a story than the first(still very good though) the film is solid. Its much darker than the first with more death and fighting. Something that both hurt and benefited the new film was the lack of magical creatures. With more human activity, the film definitely stands on its own. The magic is definitely a cool part of it though, and sometimes you wish that you could see more of it. -Overall ""Price Caspian"" is a fine film, but isn't as great as the first. Its quite different from the first, which gives it its own originality to stand on. A-",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
209,bbck7,Disney has lost ability to tell a story,2,23 May 2008,"I pity anyone going into this movie without seeing the first installment. Disney starts telling this story in the middle somewhere and expects everyone to know everything about the main characters.The screenplay is terrible, it has left out all the important details of the book. It jumps around making no sense. The director seems to say, since I do not have a screenplay we will cover it up with a lot of special effects action.The acting is stiff unable to overcome trying to act in an empty studio in front of a blue screen. I don't know how many times we are looking at the four majesties lined up looking into the camera saying their lines trying to make facial gestures in tune with the storyline.Wait until it is free on the tube, and then if there is a baseball game on, skip this movie.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
210,yoel_marson,More LOTR than CSL but still great fun,8,28 June 2008,"Taking kids to the cinema can sometimes be painful but this trip was as much for me as them; i have read the book countless times and have just finished it with my eldest daughter.The film was more LOTR than CS Lewis and don't know what he would have made of this interpretation. There was just enough in common with the book as to transfer the empathy that i have built with the characters over the last 25 years. There were some changes and original scenes that were totally unnecessary and the tone of the movie was much darker and action oriented than the book.The upside is that aside from that it was a very well made film, almost up there with LOTR in terms of great fantasy and infinitely more appealing to anyone over 12 years old than Harry Potter.After fictitiously originating the pevensies from finchley in the 1st movie, he has now made the telmarines Spanish and that sort of worked OK. The pevensies and caspian were close to what i would have imagined and the supporting cast of dwarfs and mice were excellent.Another 2 years to wait till Voyage of the Dawntreader; would have liked to have seen Horse and his boy next. Mind you, in theory that could be done in 10 years time with the same actors.All in all, a great improvement on the lion, the witch and the wardrobe.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
211,blippster,You may find Narnia a more savage place than you remember,8,17 June 2008,"I wont comment on the plot for the sake of newcomers to the story, but I will say this: It is deeper, darker, and danker than the first.From the very first scenes you can see that things have changed. The primary antagonist, Lord Miraz, is a brutal tyrant, and in my opinion, a much better villain than the White Witch. I read on his IMDb trivia section, that Sergio Castellitto (the actor of Miraz) has never played a villain before this role. After seeing this film, you will not be able to believe he could play anything but a villain.Ben Barnes (Prince Caspian) is perfect for the role. Caspian and the Telmarines have all been portrayed as Spaniards or other Europeans for this film, a stroke of genius from director Andrew Adamson. Barnes is able to pull off the raw emotion of his character, which is seen vividly during the scene in Miraz's bedroom (people who've seen the film will know what I'm talking about).Peter Pevensie is struggling with the frustration of being 'trapped' in a boy's body after growing up as a man in Narnia. William Moseley pulls the part off without a hitch, and his verbal sparring with Caspian is wonderfully acted.Skandar Keynes (Edmund)'s voice has broken since the first Narnia film, which really is a stroke of luck for Adamson, since the character Edmund is now much more psychologically mature and responsible, no longer the whiny little brat from the first one. Keynes is excellent in his part, better than any of the other child actors in this film, and better than other current child actors such as Daniel Radcliffe and Freddie Highmore. Keynes should have a secure future career by now.The film has quite a bit more battle scenes than C.S. Lewis's novel, something that Lewis may have disliked, but that I felt befitted the film. A whole new battle scene is inserted at Miraz's castle, and although it is lengthy, it nonetheless serves purpose, and brings much more tension to the story. While this, and other scenes are added, no major scenes from the book are compromised, except for a few flashback scenes of Caspian's childhood, which are easily done without.To conclude, this movie is better in every way possible than its predecessor. I can only hope that the films will continue in this fashion. The title of this comment, taken from the trailer, pretty much sums it up. I recommend any fans of the first film (even people who 'kind of liked it') to see the sequel.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
212,ccvictim,Unnecessary Fiddling,6,20 February 2009,"I am that rare person who managed to read Prince Caspian without having read The LWW. I have seen the first film and believe the last 15 minutes reasonably reflected the Pevensie children as I imagined them from reading the second book. I'm afraid the liberties taken by this film version distort the family relationships as well as rendering other characters completely unfaithful in that context. Enough about the authenticity of the film.There has been a fair amount of criticism of this film's actors on this board. As an eldest child I feel compelled to defend the actor portraying Peter as he can hardly have recognised the character he was playing from the book. Whether he appreciated the changes made to Peter or not, he was acting blind, and, surely, it is up to the director to ensure that there is an appropriate consistency in the portrayal. The character presented makes absolutely no sense when compared with the character developed at the end of the first film. To suggest he is having difficulty adapting to being a physical child again is a real stretch. The other children's roles are a tad more consistent with the written word though there is a 21st century knowing about all of them that causes them to lose the sense of wonder necessary. The portrayal of Caspian is also dumbed down, as if, children are no longer expected to imagine the breadth of personality and mixed emotions reflected in the book.As usual I ended up enjoying certain elements of the film because of its visual nature (New Zealand excels again), but, now is the time to challenge the children of the world's imaginations rather than spoon feed them this shallower version.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
213,Ytadel,"An amusing, frivolous bit of fantasy fluff",6,2 December 2010,"I didn't think that the first Chronicles of Narnia movie was exactly bad, just a little on the bland side. It felt like it was trying really hard to be Lord of the Rings, a tendency which got worse as the film went on and was most prominent in the final battle scene, which captured less the excitement of the climax of The Two Towers and more the Gungans versus the droid army from The Phantom Menace. Tilda Swinton was the only real acting highlight and the effects and artwork and so on did little to impress.And while The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian comes nowhere close to greatness, I can say I enjoyed it a good bit more than the first film - enough to recommend it to anyone who (like me) is a sucker for fantasy movies. I'd place it about on the same level as the first two Harry Potter films, not a masterpiece by any stretch, but at least worth its weight in celluloid.First off, the technical aspects - the cinematography, the lighting, the special effects, the weapons, the costumes, the sets, the creature makeup, and so on - all get a pretty significant boost from the first, and feel a lot more in line with Weta Workshop's work on Lord of the Rings. It has a rawer, darker, slightly more lived-in feel to it, and weapons look a little heavier and little deadlier. This may not add to the soul of the movie, but it makes the body a lot more attractive. Pretty much the only thing that still looks awkward is the talking ""real world"" animals - a talking beaver, a talking mouse, and so on still look a hint off, more cartoon than flesh-and-blood-and-fur beast. The fantasy creatures like minotaurs look great, though.The movie is also darker than the first. That this movie got a PG rating is another example of how useless the MPAA is, because this movie is really violent. Pretty much every speaking character (including the central children) happily murders many fellow human beings during the movie's many, many battles. In pure percentage of screen time, this movie has damn near as much battling as Return of the King, and for people who enjoy fantasy battling, this may be enough entertainment to justify the film. It's all pretty well done, and I admire how the director actually managed to make the ""flow"" of the battles make visual sense. You see the larger movement of the armies, the way individual flanks and units engage each other, and always understand where the major players are. In lieu of fantasy films that settle for making their big battles an orgy of visual nonsense (see Eragon for more details), this was satisfying.As for the movie's weaknesses... well, Ben Barnes who plays Prince Caspian and all of the main Pevensie kids are all really bland actors (except Skandar Keynes a.k.a. Edmund, who I think has potential) who fail to engage you in the characters in the drama. Compared to the Harry Potter gang in screen presence, it's not even a contest. The villains are also really generic and instantly forgettable fantasy villains, who don't inspire a hint of love-to-hate- 'em goodness. And without likable players to root for in the conflict it's hard to get emotionally involved with who lives and who dies, so there isn't really any ""drama"" here - just spectacle. If spectacle is enough to entertain you, this may be OK, but this film is kind of the fantasy version of empty calories. Fun to watch, but without a lot of depth to necessitate ever rewatching. Also, the climax pretty much redefines the term deus ex machina.On the other hand of acting though, Peter Dinklage is very entertaining and probably gives the best performance in the film as Trumpkin, and it's always nice to see Warwick Davis (a.k.a. Willow) on the big screen.So when all is said and done, it's another pretty entertaining fantasy movie. It doesn't have the high, epic drama of Lord of the Rings or the likable creativity of the recent Harry Potter flicks, but it's a damn sight better than Eragon and (in my opinion) the first Narnia film. Fantasy fans probably won't regret checking it out; non-fantasy fans will certainly live if they don't.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

I would not take my kids to see it.As the scene in the end with the mouse. So we just had this battle where thousands of humans just died, but thats all OK because we managed to save the one mouse.I know some people may make the comment that the Lord of the Rings was very violent, but it was never trying to be a kids movie either.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

It isn't a Lord of the Rings or The Godfather purely because of the kid aspect to these films, but I think of them as certainly entertaining. Walden Media has done a great job with these films and as a person who has not read the books I am extremely surprised with what they have done. I found this movie a great sequel to the first and kept me guessing about things to the end. The special effects were captivating and the plot sustained curiosity throughout. I would definitely recommend this movie to the young crowd or fans of the books because from what I have read, Walden Media has done a fantastic job of giving the books what they deserve. There isn't superb acting (although the kids have definitely improved from the first), there isn't a great cast, but these movies have kept me entertained and I think it is another along with movies such as Iron Man that have kicked the entertainment aspect of this summer off with a bang.8/10 Great Film for the Kids",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

When Caspian starts running from his own kingdom, the horse scene was really fast paced. The story was not drawn out and the acting was believable. They show more imagination and creativity than in the first, and the world seemed more magical in a way. The cast was picked well, and thankfully, they stepped the action up a level. Maybe they'll step the next movie up to PG-13, which might attract more audiences. Their was a little love between Susan and Caspian in the movie along with some flirtatious moments but not overdone. The CGI was done well, and so basically the action storyline acting and cast compiled with all the other parts of the movie deserves a 9/10.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
218,Pixie-Belle,Not a strong likeness to the book.,6,5 June 2008,"Very excited about seeing the 2nd Narnia film, having read all the books as a child Prince Caspian was one of my favourites as I loved how he was told the stories of old Narnia as a child and desperately wanted to see the old days return. Unfortunately the Caspian in the film seems to have little knowledge of Old Narina! The images from the books which I though would have been a useful tool for the film makers were not used once, a deep disappointment to me, especially as other films such as LOTR worked so hard to recreate the images fans of the book were familiar with. Of course there are the comparisons to LOTR, and at times it does feel like they are simply recreated smaller more child like version of events and characters from LOTR, of course when a film as great as LOTR is made every fantasy flick after will always be compared and fail to match it. If you haven't read the book I'm sure it will be an enjoyable family film, it is darker then the first and some parts will frighten small children. But for fans of the book the likeness to the book can be painfully little at times, and will leave you confused as to where the story is going. The back story for Caspian was not very well developed but as Caspian features in the next two books/films hopefully we will see and learn more about him. I will go and see the film again in the coming weeks and watch it as a fantasy fan and not as a fan of the books, hopefully I will enjoy it more!",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
219,revran,Disappointing in the extreme!,1,18 May 2008,"Since the Chronicles of Narnia are a series of widely read and revered books I had to give my first rating of a 1 for this film. We went opening night and I was very disappointed and my wife was in tears by the end because of her disappointment. So much of Lewis' humor was lost in favor of an action movie plot with running battles, some added that aren't in the book while other important pieces from the book are left out. It became just one long tedious battle. And a romance between Caspian & Susan? We love those books so very, very much that it was painful to watch. Our children ages 21, 18 & 15, who were raised on Narnia, were not just disappointed but angry... My eldest daughter was livid. Her close friend whom we had introduced to Narnia just two years ago was very unhappy with what was left out of the film not to mention all that was added. My wife and I felt it was as if the person who wrote the screenplay hadn't read the books at all. Two revealing things we noticed too were during the opening credits with Actors and Directors and Producers names in huge type, it seemed to us that ""From a book by C.S. Lewis"" was in much smaller type. Also, during the previews of coming attractions, there was another fantasy movie advertised and it had in large print, ""From a writer of the Chronicles of Narnia"". They must have been referring to a screenwriter, but it was very aggravating! There was only one author of the Chronicles of Narnia and it was C.S. Lewis! Interestingly, they decided to cast all the Telemarines as evil Spaniards. I found that fascinating and would like to know the rationale behind that? In the books, the girls do not participate as warriors, Aslan having said war is unpleasant and decidedly so if girls participate. However, in the movie, Susan is a major warrior and is seen leading Narnians and firing her arrows into Telemarines all over the place. At the final climax and their departure from Narnia, (she and Peter for the last time) she and Prince Caspian first exchange longing glances, which you've been aware of all throughout the film, and then they passionately kiss! I'm all for that of course, but not in this movie about this book... to quote a little boy who was sitting with his grandfather in front of us, ""That was yucky!""",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
220,panache2005,A Satisfying Follow-Up,7,18 May 2008,"Prince Caspian is the first movie I've ever been able to sit all the way through.In terms of bladder, of course. I hate getting up in the middle of a film I've paid good money to see just because I decided to order a large Coke with my popcorn. But, I'm happy to report that I managed to hold it just so I wouldn't miss a minute of this film.While the script got a little cornball at times (the family dynamics between the Pevensies are a little wacko), the plot was engaging and suspenseful, the special effects were wow-ing, and the characters were definite crowd-pleasers, and I was only a little dissatisfied at some of the sap that always comes with a PG rating.But on that... I have no idea how they managed to get away with PG! There's so much battle, and death, and even the fight between Peter and his antagonists at the beginning in the subway station is graphic enough for PG-13. Younger viewers and parents beware. Regardless, if you loved its predecessor, Prince Caspian should not be missed.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

I loved the first one but this one it was the first one times infinity for me. I may see it again (who am I kidding? Of course I'm going to see it again.) It was very Lord of the Rings-ish to me in a lot of parts. And I'm a HUGE LOTR fan. Ben Barnes was the best in my opinion. He reminded me of Inigo Montaya from the Princess Bride- - only better. Way better. Caspian is my favourite character. While this movie is awesome, it is a bit violent for three to eight year olds. The acting was well done and the scenery was awesome. I love this movie a lot and... I have never seen a movie in the theatres that was this good. (I saw LOTR on DVD) I think the next movie I'll say that about is the Hobbit.

222,michyh1,Nice Getaway without the High Cost of Travel,9,23 May 2008,"I really enjoyed Prince Caspian.It took me away from my humdrum life for a few hours & took me into a fantasy world where I could lose myself in Narnian ""intrigue"". It even took the sting out of my nearly $4.00 / gallon gas tank fill-up earlier in the day. Thanks to this movie, horseback riding is looking a lot more appealing as well.I loved that the latest special effects are used fully & that the film makers have succeeded in creating a true magical reality. Wow, what a difference between this and the earlier BBC versions of Narnia. Who would have thought they could make Reepicheep live & breathe like they have? The White Witch in the ice was awesome also. Dare I say,""chilling?"" **duck head**The casting was perfect. Ben Barnes is a hunky Caspian. I forget the name of the actor who plays Peter but he's improved too. Everyone has grown up & matured and it shows here. To those cynics who call this ""Christian Propaganda"" do they know what they are talking about? What is so offensive about Jesus anyway? Willing to lay your life down for your friends? Sacrificing for the good of many? (I think that the U.S. Military does that for me everyday)... Read the bible first and make up your own mind. I think it's secular propaganda that you are a victim of.....this is harmless stuff compared to a ""Hostel"" or ""Sweeney Todd"" (which I have heard about but will never ever see). Granted there are battles but isn't just living a lifelong battle? At least Christians have Jesus - Narnians have Aslan. We're not spared from the battle but are given help and hope along the way to make it through and we learn/develop from what we learn as a result. Wow, that's really offensive (heavy sarcasm). Keep up the good work, Disney. We need more of these fine movies and I am willing to go back to see this a couple of more times because you did a great job turning a difficult book into a watchable and enjoyable film. I'm looking forward to The Voyage of the Dawn Treader.One final note, though. Please use better music at the end of the next movie. Usually the end song adds something to the final impression of a film but this one was pretty bad. Corny. Cheesy. Cringe-worthy. The kiss was fine, though. Any girl in her right mind would want to smooch that Prince. I know I would, so I'm glad they did it!",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
223,silkshadow,Rare time when a sequel is better than the original but beware on violence for kids,9,11 June 2008,"Like many other people out there, the Narnia books were my first introduction to the fantasy genre. In 4th grade, my teacher Mrs. Martindale gave me the first couple of books in our class secret santa, and I fell in love with books from there. I was bitterly disappointed by the first movie in this series. Not because it wasn't beautifully shot (it was), not because I didn't like the actors (I kind of did), not because of the effects (which I liked) but because, unlike the book, the movie didn't make me care about the characters, nor really get into the world of Narnia, or the story, at all. The core to a movie is the story and how the story is told IMO. ""Wardrobe"" failed miserably in telling a great story.That out of the way, bring on Prince Caspian which I was expecting great things from based on the net vibe. Today I just came home from my 4th viewing. This movie had all the elements that I did like from the first movie, and then it did just a totally wonderful job of pulling me into the story and the characters. Unlike the first movie, I was engaged throughout and rode the ups and downs of the story like a child on a swing: with joy. Instead of ""kind of"" liking the actors, I loved them this time. I felt they did a great job in their roles and in getting you to understand all the dimensions of their characters. Interesting side note, I felt that Anna Popplewell started to steal the show in the way that Emma Watson started taking the stage in the Potter series. Started, let me emphasize.I'm not a purist on these literary and comic adaptions. Though I do feel if a director/writer takes radical liberties, it better be good. Having re-read the book a week before the movie was released, I noted that they took some, arguably, radical edits from the book which I found I applauded. It put the story together in a much better way for the shorter time and medium of a movie, as opposed to a book.Why I took a point off is that some parts of this movie were a bit dark (especially the opening) and I had trouble seeing the action clearly. I've watched it 4 times in 3 different digital projection theaters, and I can almost definitively say that its not the theaters. Also, this movie is a bit grittier and more violent than the first. Whether you like that or not is not the issue (I liked it), but the rating is wrong. Its comedic that sexual situations is a big ratings taboo but violence constantly gets a pass. On my first viewing, my girlfriend and I were accompanied by her 12 year old niece and friend. The violence in (without spoilers) the first combat scene and its ending I felt was too much for their young eyes.Otherwise, great movie! It is 2 and a half hours which goes by too fast. I definitely recommend seeing this movie!",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
224,grayure,Too much fighting but quite romantic,5,1 July 2008,"I really liked the first film. It was quite true to the book, but the main problem was the over-long battle scene. Unfortunately, this film departed further from the book in a way which i felt undermined the previous one and had very long battle scenes compared to the book, presumably due to the LOTR market. I really hope that they make 'Voyage Of The Dawn Treader' and look forward to it because of the near-complete lack of fighting.Having said that, there were things i liked. I am going through a phase of interest in mediaeval stuff, so i quite liked the likes of the costumes and the accoutrements of war, though doubtless they were quite inaccurately portrayed. I also felt a connection with two of the actors, because Anna Popplewell looks like one of my old girlfriends, though i'm far too old to be lusting after someone young enough to be my daughter, and i'm also a big fan of Eddie Izzard. The portrayal of the Telmarines as Hispanic was true to the book, but it may have exposed C S Lewis' own racism. I have a quibble with this. Shouldn't they all have been speaking Spanish? I was also interested in the idea that the baddies use crossbows and the goodies longbows.My son, whom i took to see this as a special treat, was disappointed, mainly because of the long battle scene. He's as bloodthirsty as the next eleven year old boy, so that can't have been it, and since he doesn't share my distaste for violence, it suggests that it fails on its own terms (though that might be the lack of Daleks for him).So, all in all, rather disappointing but i have some hope for the sequel, should it be made. Presumably it will. However, if they mess with it, i won't be at all happy. I want these films to be close to the books, which are classics.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
225,MozaredTFT,Surprisingly good,7,4 April 2009,"When I first watched the original Narnia movie, it was a nice view but never more than that. I thought it was pretty shamelessly trying to rip off Lord of the Rings and I've always had the mindset of ""It'll entertain me, but it's far from a good movie"" about it. I went into this 'sequel' with that mindset, and I was very much surprised in what I encountered.Where the first movie seemed to be much more of a ""children's movie"", this one takes a more serious approach. It's not a movie with a standard Hollywood theme - bad things happen and there's no ""overhappy"" ending where all the bad things are undone and everything ends up right. And while the movie has a more grown-up tone than it's predecessor, it manages to do so without implementing a lot more gore like most other movies do. To take the turn on two wheels, I suppose I could say ""more people will be shown dying but the amount of gore shown on screen is still virtually non-existent"".Also, where in the first movie I could predict pretty much every upcoming line or event, I only correctly did so once in this movie. The plot is definitely good enough to keep you interested, and the movie is acted and played in a very pleasant way.The only thing I didn't really like about the movie is that at around 3/4ths of it, it seemed to say ""oh sod it all"" and just tied up all remaining story arcs with short and somewhat strange solutions. It seemed like the movie was about halfway through filming when somebody said ""We're out of time, lets round it up now"". I do have a feeling that this 'abrupt ending' mainly occurs because I haven't read the books - something tells me there's a lot more explanation given there for the phenomenons that now make the movie look rather cheap.Leaving out that flaw, the movie is very watchable, though. I'd even go as far as to say it's ""pretty decent"" and I probably have to admit it is one of the very few movies I know to start off with a horrible ""part one"" and continue with a most impressing sequel. This movie is watchable for basically the entire family, though I do suggest starting off with the first one if you intend to show it to your kids. Last but not least, I'd actually recommend this movie to everybody who (like me) thought the first one was a horrible children-focused rip-off of Lord of the Rings.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

The first one had this magical Christmas-y feel to it I could keep watching it on DVD without getting tired of it.Prince Caspian started out okay but I found myself hoping the Pevensies would show up on screen soon and when they did, I felt a smile creep up my face. Some things weren't explained well. I often found myself explaining some scenes to my friends and my family, whom I watched with, because none of them read the book. But then, I didn't read the book thoroughly either.The new film was alright. I thought the battle sequences were really cool (from the view point of a person who does not know much about war tactics and strategy). I thought the use of some of the old score was great! It made the Prince Caspian feel more connected to the first movie.The special effects weren't as good as the first one, or at least, I think so. The animated creatures seemed more ""animated"" than ""real"". Reepicheep reminded me of Puss-in-Boots in the Shrek movies. The audience in my theatre found the mouse endearing though.I read that some scenes like the Night Raid was added into the film (not part of the book) but I thought that added scene was great and the ending of that scene was wonderfully acted by William Moseley.It was certainly nice to see all the actors mature - looks-wise and personality-wise, especially Georgie Henley (who plays Lucy).There was a lot of humor in this film, compared to the first one. I definitely loved that.Two things that kept going through my mind though were: (1) I never thought I'd want to cry during a Narnia movie. First the end of the Night Raid scene. Then, the ending - with that song, The Call by Regina Spektor. It was strange having a song like that in a film that took you to another world but I fell in love with the song. The ending left me sad though. I tried to laugh when Edmund said he left his new torch in Narnia but my laugh seemed forced. I didn't have the light, happy feeling I got after seeing the first film but that didn't bother me so much.What bothered me more was that (2) Skandar Keynes (who plays Edmund Pevensie) was underused! I thought he could do more than just be in the background and have a few lines. I noticed that the other kids got a fair share of close-ups except for him. There was one scene - when the kids approached the Stone Table. Each Pevensie got a close-up. Then, when Edmund's character was about to get one then the camera panned away immediately. Edmund is my favorite character in LWW and I always wanted to see more of him. I'd have to say though. His scenes were the most memorable for me. There's something about him (and I can't explain what or why) that makes me notice him over the others when he's on-screen.Over-all, I thought this movie was good. Not as breathtaking at first but still great all the same. I must've liked it so much since I watched it twice and I still want to go see it a third time. So, I gave it an 8/10!",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
229,mozzis,Excellent film and book adaptation,8,22 June 2008,"Rather than write my own complete commentary let me just add to what I've read so far.Many commented that the four principals' characters did not seem to have developed adequately since the first movie. Note that they have been thrust back into their original lives for over a year. Who knows how real people would react to that situation? Given this, I thought the portrayals were convincing overall, and Moseley's in particular seemed realistic. Keynes was underused but with an ensemble like this in a series you will probably have to see some ""taking turns"" as to character emphasis in the plots. I think that both Anna Popplewell's role and her acting were much improved in this film. And I appreciated the much better sword choreography, due no doubt in part to the physical growth of the actors over the last couple of years.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
230,ilovekittiesdotcom,"Loved the movie, but it took forever to end",8,28 May 2008,"I liked the movie, but I always like these types of movies. I liked the little soldier mouse, he was too cute! I was a little sad that Aslan didn't appear in the movie until the end, besides in Lucy's dream. But I did like the imagination that showed through the movie and it was like you were really in Narnia (that sounds corny, I know). I never saw the first one, so there was a few things that I didn't understand, but I was fine though.Like I said in my summary, it took forever getting to the ending. It was probably because I saw this movie at night and I was tired, but I don't think that was it. It was like this: you would get to a point in the movie, thinking it was the ending, then it would keep going on and on and on. I don't even think the part with the White Witch were even needed, I think it was just filler.All in all, a good movie.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
231,spire65,Could've been better,7,26 May 2008,"Firstly, I will say that it is still a great film, and I may be biased having read the book and seen the BBC version.The movie takes a great deal of liberties with the story. That is expected, but the liberties were taken a bit too far in certain places. Lengthy scenes that never existed were added. There also seemed too be a bit too much male ego flying around that was not apparent in either the book or BBC film.My biggest qualm with the film is the casting of Prince Caspian. The actor is nearly 27 at the time this movie hit the theaters! If I recall, Prince Caspian was supposed to be early teens. That is a huge divergence, and he has been recast for the next installment, Voyage of the Dawn Treader, which is supposed to have a jump of maybe 10+ yrs from this story. Needless to say, I am biased, having read the book and seen a previous adaptation.The last criticism is that Edmund was not utilized as much as he should have been. Both the actor and character were even better in this film than the previous.On to the good points. Fight scenes were done well, but were not quite as epic-feeling as the last battle in the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. However, they were much faster paced than Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe's (adding to my own desire for this movie to have been 30 mins longer). Artistry and cinematography were top notch, just as it was in the first movie. The villain, Miraz, is no Tilda Swinton, but well cast nonetheless--better than the BBC's version in my opinion. The best casting choice was Eddie Izzard for Reepicheep. PERFECT choice -- I cannot think of anyone who could've done a better job at that role.All in all, very good movie. It is DEFINITELY worth seeing in the theaters on the big screen. It is a beautiful movie, but it is simply not quite as good as it could have been (and not as good as the first movie).",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
232,dying_fetus,For kids only?,5,11 November 2008,"I admit, I enjoyed the books by C.S. Lewis when I was a kid, I guess you can compare the books to today's bestseller Harry Potter in that aspect. Now, 20 years later, I get to see the movies based upon these books that really liked when I was just a kid and I'm disappointed. I don't know if it's because I've grown up and can't seem to identify myself with the characters anymore or because this movie just doesn't do it for me any more. The CGI effects are often pretty good however as are the other visuals, but the characters and story just feel a bit outdated, it seems this movie wants to be like The Lord of the Rings, but those books are so much mature than this (and the movie too for that matter). I thought the first movie was somewhat better, giving it a 6 out of 10, but this movie is just not quite as ""good"" as the sequel. So, even if you enjoyed the books when you were a kid, or enjoyed the first movie, don't automatically mean you'd enjoy this, I'm afraid. To say the least, I'm a bit disappointed after this movie took ~2½hours of my time.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
233,temlakos-1,It grows on you,10,8 April 2010,"Those looking for an absolutely faithful adaptation have, of course, expressed their disappointment. But in fact, a faithful adaptation would never have worked. Adamson and his team did the best job they could have done, and have produced a work that offers a lot of sobering life lessons.In the original, Peter and his siblings find themselves abruptly transported back to Narnia--hundreds of years after they left it--and are thrown into a war on the side of Prince Caspian, who has already lost three battles. That would have been supremely difficult for Adamson to portray. Instead, Caspian inadvertently summons the Pevensies on the very night of his escape from the Telmarine castle, and we cut back and forth between the Pevensie children trying to investigate what has happened to their beloved Narnia in their absence, and Caspian trying to stay ahead of the forces of his usurping uncle, Lord Protector Miraz, and win the trust of the Narnians, who have no reason to trust him.Furthermore, Peter learns the harsh lesson of command by learning what it feels like to lose a major battle (and half his fighting force), and also to learn that one bad general is still better than two good generals who argue.All this might not seem to be a suitable story for children. In fact, Adamson obviously chose to tell the story on an adult level, as Peter Jackson did with his Lord of the Rings trilogy. And this story works--on an adult level, with characters who learn adult lessons.The four actors who portrayed the Pevensie children are back, and they act like a family--and a family with a secret that none of their peers could possibly understand. Peter might not be so ""magnificent"" at first, but that only shows that he perhaps did not learn all the lessons that he ought to have learned the first time around. Georgie Henley more than holds her own as an older and wiser Lucy--and Skandar Keynes is excellent as Edmund, who is definitely not the same spiteful and selfish boy he was in the first story. Ben Barnes does an excellent turn as Caspian, who must prove to himself, his people, and his allies that he truly has the makings of a king--and can face a king's challenges when needed.In addition, this film has other truly delightful characters who provide just the right amount of comic relief. My personal favorite: Eddie Izzard's Reepicheep, who looks at life as one big battle until Aslan gives him some necessary perspective. My second favorite: Trufflehunter the badger, who offers his own unique brand of folksy wisdom.Others have said elsewhere that this story was probably the most difficult of all the Narnia stories to adapt to film. That's probably correct. But the true test of any story is: Does it stand on its own, in the medium in which it plays out? For this film, the answer is: Yes. I liked it, and I suspect that you will, too, after you've seen it often enough.Of course, I'm waiting for Voyage of the Dawn Treader, which is supposed to be the best of the lot. I can believe that--for I look forward to seeing a much-wiser King Caspian leading a quest at sea.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
234,purrfectfire,The story-line seemed to be ragged and pieced together and all seemed a more about the fighting scenes than about a storytelling...,6,28 September 2016,"I am greatly disappointed in this movie. Maybe partly to my expectations, but "" Prince Caspian"" lost all its charm and wonder to me. Maybe if yo would see it as a stand alone film it could hold up, but since it is a part of the first movie's story, it fails to engage me as the first movie did. I liked that the characters got a bit more depth, but all side characters got neglected and seemed dull and uninteresting. For the mouse, the makers even 'borrowed' the character of Puss in Boots from 'Shrek'. The story-line seemed to be ragged and pieced together and overall this movie seems to be a portfolio for fighting scenes, rather than a well told story.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

236,andrewpotter1-1,What a bad movie!,4,12 June 2008,"First of all, let me say that I LOVE The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe! The movie was (in my opinion) perfect, exactly what I wanted it to be. Being a humongous fan of the books, I must admit that Prince Caspian is my favorite. At first, I couldn't exactly explain why, it just sort of moved me... that was cheesy. But, I think after thinking about it for a while the reason it is my favorite is for the simple element that it carries that the movie did not... spirit. The book (Prince Caspian) had a spirit and a soul, it did not depend on making all of these big, epic battle sequences. It took the time to make me love all of these characters, and did not depend on throwing in a corny joke. A friend of mine told me after the movie that he thought the humor was placed in the ""appropriate places"". At that point, I knew exactly why I did not like this movie. In the book, these ""appropriate places"" did not exist. Do I mind a good tweak here and there? OF COURSE NOT! I am fully aware that a movie must be handled differently than a book. (In fact, the ""witch revival"" scene was probably my favorite part of the whole film) Did I mind the fact that they made the Telamarine Hispanic? No! In fact all of these tiny details (that bothered so many of my fellow Narnia fans) did not affect me in the least. What bothered me is the fact that almost none of these new characters were developed at all in the least. They took a great storyline (in my opinion the best story in the whole series) and shredded it into a mindless, dumbed- down CGI Battle movie that a 5 year old could understand. To summarize, Prince Caspian had A LOT of potential that was simply ruined by too big a budget, and an embarrassingly bad screenplay.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
237,NoelCT,Rousing,8,28 May 2010,"Soon after the Pevensies mysteriously abandoned their thrones, Narnia found itself under siege from the fierce men of Telmar. They rapidly took control and brutally ruled the lands, wiping out every being that wasn't ""human"" to the point where centaurs, dwarfs, and fawns became little more than legend. Over a thousand years have gone by, and this is the world the Pevensies return to when they are summoned by an exiled prince.I'll be honest: I didn't like the book. I enjoy the series, but PRINCE CASPIAN has always been a bit of a letdown for me. There's a good core concept in there with some nice characters and ideas, but the final product always felt like a great 30 or 40 page short story hurriedly padded out to novel-length.It's with great pleasure that I applaud Adamson for taking those elements and restructuring them into a near masterpiece of an epic film. What was a drawn out opening is now a rollicking escape. What was a chaotic battle is now a beautifully executed war. What were stale characters are now layered and conflicted beings.The Pevensies are all back in top form, perfectly mixing the foibles of youth with the knowledge and experience of their decades-long reign. Joining them is Ben Barnes, who gives insecurity and depth to the title role of dashing Prince Caspian. Throw in a scene-stealing performance from Peter Dinklage, and the always welcome presence of Warwick Davis, and you get a superb cast of heroes.The villains don't come off so well. Don't get me wrong, the actors aptly play their parts but, Caspian aside, the entire populace of Telmar is painted as nothing but a nation of genocidal xenophobes desperate for power.This brings up the double-edged sword of two sequences I know have created a bit of controversy: 1) the night-time siege of the castle, and 2) the ""resurrection"" of the White Witch. While both are superbly executed, neither really has a lasting impact on the story. Trimming one or both would not only give more time to better round-out the Telmarines, but shorten the unnecessary length of two-and-a-half hours.Now, those aside, this is still a fantastic movie. The glossy, storybook look that didn't entirely work in THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE gets a makeover here. It's still the same basic design, but we finally get the appreciated elements of grit and texture. And the colors, while not muted, no longer artificially burst off the screen like a cartoon.And Adamson really knows how to bring this world to life. While the night raid may be disposable story-wise, he did a marvelous job of building a strategic attack that beautifully incorporated the vast variety of denizens Narnia has to offer. Especially when Reepicheep, who came off a cute sidekick in the book, gets to show off some formidable sword fighting skills catered to his physicality.Alas, one other problem. And I don't blame Adamson, because there's really no way around it. Aslan. Big battle, hope is lost, lion shows up to save the day. Granted, while the results of his appearance were executed as more a helpful nudge than an all-out rescue, things still get awkward when he starts interfering left and right without an acceptable answer as to why he couldn't get off his hairy heiny and do that before.These flaws still don't change the fact that this is a marvelous movie that anyone with a tiny sense of adventure should truly enjoy.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

But action is what made this entire series is it not?

The acting was spectacular and the ending felt real good! Two thumbs up to the person who does the casting. I recommend everyone who is a fan of the genre to see this film. I don't think younger kids will enjoy this too much but it depends on the kid and his/her level of maturity and understanding. I will definitely see this movie more than once!!!!

240,Equinox1772,"Great movie, but lacking something",5,18 May 2008,"CONTAINS HEAVY SPOILERS, DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE! One of the things I very much enjoyed about the first film was the family dynamic of it. Although at odds with each other in the beginning, the Pevensie siblings grew a bond near the end that you could feel in the audience. My particular favorite moment from the first film is when Peter, about to lead the charge against the white witch's forces, turns to look back at his brother up on the cliff who nods to him in encouragement. The embrace between them all when Edmund is healed by the potion is another great moment. You got a sense of how much they cared for each other and I really admired that about ""Wardrobe."" In ""Caspian"", that dynamic seemed nearly totally deflated. I did really enjoy the fast paced action and multiple battles, but the movie seemed like a kind of battle-charged, hurried remake of the first film. You see several things happen during this movie that you saw happen in the first, such as Lucy sneaking away, Susan and Lucy going off just before a battle, and the trees saving the day (they can apparently walk now). Some of that is okay, such as the white witch making a cameo (and I loved how it was Edmund who got to put an end to her ""resurrection"") but it just seemed like they said ""okay, let's do wardrobe again, but with a lot more fighting, no character interaction, and no explanation of things."" Not enough time is spent explaining what has happened in the Pevensie's lives since they have been back in England. Likewise, other than a brief mention that Narnia was invaded and obviously conquered, it is not explained how or why. We do not learn anything about what happened to favorite characters such as Mr. Tumnus and the Beavers.I know that the center of attention was supposed to be on Prince Caspian (and I am writing this based solely on having seen the movies and not read the books so maybe the books are better) but to spend so little time on the family dynamic of the Pevensies, something which was the soul of the first film, did them a disservice. There was a little of it there when Peter tried to tell Edmund how he's always been there for him, but even that was cut off by Edmund telling Peter to save it for later.Aslan's character was also done a HUGE disservice. Not showing up until near the end, after a lot of Narnians had been killed. And I didn't get that stuff at the end about how Aslan could send those people back to where they came from. It seemed to me that, now that Caspian was established, that they would want to remain there with him. But I'm being way to negative...time to balance this review out with some positives.I like how they gave Susan a bigger fighting role. The surprises in the main battle were genius, I like the aged and ruined Car-Paravel (sp?) and how they kept consistency in objects such as the stone table, the horn, the potion, and the trees (although, didn't Edmund smash the white witch's wand in the first movie and why was the stone table underground?).All in all this was a good movie, but I think I still enjoyed the first one better. The characters seemed closer and the story didn't leave me with any questions as this one did.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
241,therankines,Very Good Sequel,8,24 May 2008,"This film was just plain amazing. This film was a lot more violent then the first but that made more battle scenes which were exciting. I read the books and I really enjoyed it. The kids again are great, Tilda Swinton had a cameo which was very small but still was good and was kinda creepy which is what made it effective and plus I think no one really expected it. The end battle scene was very good as well with amazing special effects along with the rest of the movie. There was also some romance in there between Susan and Caspian. This movie is just simply amazing and I recommend it to anyone who likes a good action film with just a touch of comedy. This film didn't even seem as long as it's 2 hour and 20 minute running time because you just get so into the movie that it goes by really fast.

The roughly 150 min movie DID blow me away with a wonderful, intriguing story, above average acting, a life-enriching message, outstanding effects (a far more seamless integrating of the animal characters), and an even more refined music score. Narnia II is a must see and could elevate the series to the likes of Lord of the Rings and Star Wars... after coming out of the theater I felt the need to watch it again and immediately watch part III... a wonderful feeling.

This movie includes a darker age, more violence, more action, and definitely more humor.Though at times it sways from the storyline, it keeps its watchers on the edge of their seats during the action, and listening intently during emotional sections, as well as a lot of laughter during scenes with Reepicheep and the others.As it is, I would recommend this movie for ten years of age and up as it is much darker and slightly scarier than the first film.All I can say is: Keep the trilogy going.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
246,greasemeyer,"It came close to TLWW, but not quite.",8,11 August 2008,"After watching TLWW, I couldn't wait to get my eyes on Price Caspian. Being a huge Narnia fan, and I love the books and movies. C.S. Lewis was a gifted writer, and had a huge imagination. The beginning was good, but I was hoping that Caspian's tutor would explain more to Caspian about Narnia, it's creatures, and the 4 Great Kings and Queens of Old. I believe it would help someone who has not seen TLWW to get the big picture of the story. As the movie continued, I did enjoy the added humor, and the confidence and trust they had in themselves as Kings and Queens. But before long, the humor did get a little repetitive and old, but it did crack me up every once in a while. Lucy was the best of them all, though, believing in Aslan. She clearly had the most faith. Moving on, I saw how the movie drifted far away from the book, which was a disappointment. At first I was negative about Peter's attitude. But as I got to thinking about it, it made sense. He used to be the ""HIGH KING"", and now he's considered just a kid. It seemed his ""magnificense"" was gone, and he didn't seem to be the great king he used to be. Sometimes the scenes seemed to pass to quickly, but it varied. But I loved Aslan. He looked the best he ever did look, and everything about him was so real. I really didn't care how Susan took part in the battles, and other combat situations. But if she liked Caspian, that hardly comes as a surprise. It seemed they went a little to far with her makeup, especially on the eye shadow, which I didn't like. Otherwise, everyone else looked natural. Another thing was, it seemed like the characters said ""shutup"" to each other much more than the Narnians ever would. I also got the feeling that Andrew Adamson was adding to much ""Shreck"" to the movie. This is a classical story, not a modern day cartoon. Then came the invasions, battles, and all that good stuff. LOVED IT! Everything was so real, it felt like you were there in the battle. The ending was touching, considering the fact that Peter and Susan will never return to Narnia. Even with that, it left me with hope for the return of Edmund and Lucy. I just hope next time Andrew Adamson sticks to the book more, and I also hope he makes it more like TLWW, humor and interaction wise. Other than that, it was great, especially when you compare it to the old BBC version which was done 15 years ago. I would recommend it to any Narnia fan.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
247,andrewwilson,Excellent movie that stuck to the spirit of the book very closely,10,10 July 2008,"To all of those who are saying this film didn't follow the plot of the book, What Rot!! A few scenes were cut and a few were added, but the spirit of the book was kept to very closely.To all those that are complaining about the romance between Susan and Caspian. You are correct, there was no romance between them in the book however, in our world (in the next book) Lucy complains that she starts wearing make up and is interested in boys. This is, in fact, a sign that Susan is growing up and is part of the reason she can't go back to Narnia. It is quite acceptable in films to pull in little bits from the other books.Before anyone says, I absolutely adore the books. I have original copies and they are falling apart at the seams because I have read them so much.And, I loved this film.Films adapted from books never do, and never can match the exact plot line of the books. And neither should they. Books are not normally written cinematically.Now, rant out of the way, a critique of the film.Everything about this film is wonderful. The characters have all moved on a little (this is helped by the fact that the actors are, of course, older), the scenery wonderful, the darker elements scary, the special effects brilliant (most noticeable by the fact they are not noticeable) and the new characters well portrayed in the short time that any film gives individual characters (there are at least 10 new characters and, in most cases, their individual personalities shine through). In fact Bulgy Bear's character comes through very well, even though he only has one line.It really captures Lewis's main theme that growing up means loosing some of the magic; that the adult world is a darker place than the child-like dream world of The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe. However, in return, you gain maturity and wisdom.I am quite sure that the next film will be even better and some of the newer characters will be developed further.Do I recommend this film? Absolutely!",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
248,slytherins_queen2,I saw it twice.,9,5 July 2008,"I saw it twice. I NEVER SEE ANY MOVIE TWICE. Not even my beloved Harry Potter. I saw this movie TWICE people (just in case you haven't gathered that just yet ;) ) This movie for me was HEAPS better then Lion Witch and Wardrobe, don't get me wrong I love that movie too but this movie was so much more. Yeah, the dude who played Caspian Ben Barnes wasn't fantastic, but really it's his first feature length movie, I think he did a pretty good job. And yes they changed things, but I think for the better. Little things annoyed me though, such as Susan suddenly wearing eyeliner (though this may be because I envy Anna's beauty) seriously, how does one get eyeliner in narnia? A magic tree? And lack of Edmund who has always been my favorite character even before Skandar (though it certainly didn't hurt when Skandar came on to the scene.) And how long the battle was (this didn't bug me too much). But you know what? This film was great. Fantastic. It was Elizabeth meet Sinbad It was spiffy. Seriously this isn't a bad film, how could it be with Skandar in it? The only reason it didn't do as well as it thought it would was because of when it was released. It should've been released at Christmas it would have smashed records I'm sure. All actors/actresses improve, especially Will. The look he gives when he has to leave the rest of his army behind in the castle *fangirl heart breaks* Awww. ;_; And Georgie, wow. She's such a talented pretty girl. She carried the film well she has a certain spark like Skandar, where she can just deliver her lines. Skandar... Well I love him. His wonderful I have a crush on him. Just in case you couldn't tell =) Susan is a character I don't particularly like, but Anna is awesome in the role. I'm not saying she's the best actress in the whole world but she does what she needs to, and has improved dramatically and I really like her. Plus she kicks arse in battles! WOO. Girl power! Caspian/Susan moments too cute! This movie though was put in the shadows of other movies released this summer, such as Sex and The City, Get Smart, Wall-e, Kung Fu Panda, etc. A bad move on the company's part. I'll defiantly be getting this on DVD. Disney, a word of caution please don't release VDT in May again. It won't give the movie the time of day it deserves.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
249,a-wong-1,pretty awesome,9,17 May 2008,"I though that the first movie was between okay and good.. about 8 stars. So, i had high hopes coming to see Prince Caspian because the previews said that it was better than the first.. and i wasn't disappointed at all! Although I don't know if C.S Lewis will be impressed, i thought that as a movie, it was entertaining and quite suspenseful. The special effects were just amazing and the Narnians were believable.The music was great. I've always loved the music from the Chornicles of Narnia. I'm pretty sure that it was the same music from the first movie but that's okay because it just made the movie that much more worth watching. The cast is alright. I thought that Prince Caspian was not bad. He was good looking although I really didn't enjoy his accent much. Acting was fine. ""Peter"" was cute and his acting was not bad. I though ""Susan"" was.. just okay. ""Edmund"" was great. he's grown more since the last movie and he's gotten more handsome. ""Lucy"" grew so much! she's not a little girl anymore. she was okay at acting. Overall, it was a good movie to watch. Special effects were wonderful, music was great and acting was fine. What more can you expect?",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
250,Good_Will_Harding,An unfortunate disappointment,4,29 June 2008,"Out of the various sequels getting released this summer, Prince Caspian is the first. It seemed to me like this could be the film to put the Narnia series on the map based on the various means of advertisement (not that the first one didn't give it a little nudge). I really enjoyed The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe for what it was: an enjoyable, surprisingly original family adventure that didn't take itself too seriously. Instead, I got quite the opposite. This film is a fantastical failure only comparable to the likes of Eragon. I wanted to like this film, honestly. I admittedly had high expectations for this film. Now, I didn't go in expecting Return of the King, but I sure as hell wasn't prepared for this. The first hour of the film consists of three central story lines. The first is the one of Prince Caspian. Apparently, the birth of his cousin motivates his uncle to try and assassinate Caspian (the motive is never really explored, like many other things as you will find out). The second brings us back to the Pevensies. We spend about a total amount of two minutes in London before getting rushed back to Narnia. They haven't been to Narnia in about a year, which equals 1300 years for the Narnians. But, how do we know for sure? It says so in the trailers, but doesn't mention that at all in the film. For all we know it could have been a week for both of them. The third branches off from the first and we spend some time with Caspian's evil uncle, Miraz. With this third of the film comes it's most interesting moments. Miraz is a truly interesting character and a great bad guy. These sections of the films are cleverly written, well paced, and professionally executed. It's his little moments of villainy that made sitting through this big, ugly mess worthwhile. It's when all three of the story lines collide that the film actually seems like it's going somewhere. But, it ends up stumbling over its big, clumsy feet. Within the same five-minute time-span, this film manages to steal something from all three Lord of the Rings films. There are also a fatal amount of small errors (character development, anachronisms, plot holes, etc.). One of the various under-developed plot lines is a romance between Caspian and Susan, if you even want to call it a ""romance"". Their interest in each other wastes about five minutes, which could have been devoted to some filler between the three central story lines, rather than just having them float around with no relevance to each other. Even the craft leaves much to be desired. Unlike the first film, which exercised very basic direction and scene execution, this film tries to go above and beyond, and fails miserably. About 75% of the actions scenes were in slow motion, ruining potentially interesting moments and making the film even longer. Aside from a few moments of interest, Prince Caspian was a total disaster. Maybe I had too high hopes, but I would probably feel the same even if I wasn't expecting much. I fear for The Dark Knight.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
251,agonyzer,Prince Has He Been?,2,6 July 2008,"Well, folks, I saw this one a couple of weeks ago. Now, it is pretty well known by my long-term readership that I'm no fan of book adaptations. Comic books and/or graphic novels are one thing. Their paradigm is much different. So, without further ado:This film is the sequel to the popular Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005). I have not seen this one, given my already mentioned distaste for novel-based films. The first movie, presuming it is based even loosely on the book, is a story about four children who hide in a wardrobe and find themselves transported to a mystical kingdom full of mythical beings where they meet Jesus in the shape of a lion.The sequel, Prince Caspian, is about two hours and twenty minutes long.'Nuff said.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

I think that this movie will be an incredible hit. I also think tha this is better movie than the first one the chronicles of Narnia: The lion, The witch and the wardrove. Wonderful movie and wonderful cast, I hope that the other two movie the voyage of the dwan trader and the silver chair are good like this movie what an incredible movie is this one.I think that will win at least an Oscar.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
253,jessicawoods16,Sadly..a very bad film!,3,5 March 2009,"Now I was about 14 when the first Narnia movie came out and I was quickly obsessed, the first film is amazing and it's one of my favorites till this day. My friend saw it at the theaters and said how incredible it was and that I would love the film. I was so excited, I rented it out on DVD as soon as I could.. Which turned out for me too be a big mistake.I was so horribly disappointed at the film. The setting was so much darker then its supposed to be(One of the reasons I love Narnia is because it's has such a happy and colorful mood to it) but this one didn't have that at all! And the kids! what happened to them!! They all got miserable and what happened to the great companionship and love in the first film..they are so rude to one another in Caspien that it ruins the movie. The producers and director did not make a smart move trying to make it a bigger and better picture (I love Lord of the Rings but it had it's own dark mood that made the film, the Narnia movies never intended to have anything dark in it)They seemed to not care about the book and just change things and add things too make it better in their eyes. But the movie itself, the story, was very boring and unenjoyable to watch. Sure the actions scenes are great..but that certainly does not make a movie! Plus there is a much sadder tone to the film, oh and may I not forget..what was with the River god..that was so out there!.I think the only thing I enjoyed about the film was the kissing scene in the end..u need a little romance...oh yeah, and that the fact Ben Barnes is drop dead gorgeous!! But still, this movie is lame, if u wanna see a good movie..see the first film, so much better then this one!!",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
254,natasha_00792000,Entertaining!,8,8 June 2008,I don't know why people are criticizing it. I loved it. I haven't read any of the books. Maybe i didn't have to compare it with those.I loved everything about the movie; except maybe i didn't find the mice and lion animation very realistic..they could have been better.Locations took me out of this world the way it was meant to.Thought the battle scenes a little frightening for a very young child.The acting was adequate. Given their roles.I recommend everyone see this movie. It is definitely worth the ticket. If one does not forget that this is essentially a children's film but which all genres can enjoy; you will like it.,The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
255,statchmo,Vastly Entertaining ... Equally Disappointing,6,17 May 2008,"First things first, ""Prince Caspian"" is great entertainment, taken strictly as a movie, on its own merits. It moves fast, combines action, adventure, humor, and even a little romance, and feels much shorter than its 2-hour length.On the downside, the screenwriters have dramatically changed the storyline and some of the characters, making this movie only very loosely based on C.S. Lewis' novel of the same name.I'm not a purist when it comes to adapting books for the screen, but for me ""Prince Caspian"" goes too far afield from the original material in the name of hitting easy plot points.My major issues with the movie are the changes to Peter's character in particular. The faithful and noble Peter from the books is gone, replaced by a rebellious, unhappy, contentious teenager with a chip on his shoulder. Lewis' Peter would not have rolled around in the subway tunnel in a wrestling match with other schoolboys, not would he have knocked heads in a power struggle with Prince Caspian in Narnia. The nonsensical ""let's storm the castle"" plot line from the movie is a distraction and a time-waster. For this we are denied some of the most wonderful scenes in the book, namely those with Aslan, Susan, Lucy, plus Bacchus and his gang? I was really disappointed with the direction the writers and director chose to take this movie, but in the end, I have to admit that the movie entertains, and the faithful viewers are thrown a few bones in the conversations between Aslan and Lucy and the appearance of one of Lewis' best-loved characters, Reepicheep.As for the criticism that the movie is too dark and violent, on the contrary I found it much less disturbing than the first -- if the knife-wielding White Witch slaughtering Aslan on the Stone Table didn't get you in the first movie, I don't know why anything in ""Prince Caspian"" would be a problem.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
256,samuelgeorgecollins,A very well made film,7,2 October 2021,I feel as though I'd enjoy this a lot more if I'd seen it as a kid don't get me wrong it's very good but it lacks a certain charm and waiting for ages for aslan to show up doesn't exactly help it's cause.,The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
257,spinzin,More than what I expected!,9,18 May 2008,"If you were at the Hadley theater in S. Plainfield, NJ watching this movie and heard somebody clapping, that was ME! I was extremely impressed with this movie. The main reason why I wanted to watch this one is because I love Harry Gregson Williams. If you're wondering who he is, he is one of the backstage guys, who plays the background music!! And of course, Ben Barnes, who not only looks, well, AWESOME, but played a great Prince Caspian! For starters, the visual effects were spectacular just like its predecessor. The characters, especially the 4 kids, were so good.. They actually act like grown-ups (to think of it, they are pretty old given that they spent almost an entire lifetime in the first movie). The fights were so good, so realistic and not at all kiddish, kind of violent in fact, but in a good way! I was hoping my 10 year old cousin did not get too scared! Peter Moseley played a very matured Peter Pevensie, a perfect King! The movie was so much more than I though it would be. Heck, it even made the silly romance between Prince Caspian and Susan cute! The battles scenes were intense. The one-on-one fight between Miraz and Peter: one of the best scenes of the movie! The kid has some guts! I vote this movie to be a definite must-watch!",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
258,Shilshadu,A Slight Step Up From the First,6,16 May 2008,"My first impression of this movie after walking out of the theatre was this ""It could have been so much better,"" My reason for this is because there were a lot of elements that didn't work well at all. The beginning was terrible, from the screaming baby to the reintroduction of the Pevinsie children. Then they were sent back to Narnia in the first five minutes of the film! no explanation, just poof, very unsatisfying. Also, the first thirty minutes were very confusing, because a lot of elements, characters, ideas are thrown at you without background or reasoning, it seems cluttered. The next hour proceeds at a break-neck pace, also seeming very cluttered. I have two problems i experienced with the first hour-half. the first is when Peter first meets Prince Caspian, he hasn't met him at all throughout the movie, and all of a sudden he knows him by name. Also, a comic relief retarded bear comes in saying ""For Aslan,"" killing the moment, and coming off as unfunny. Also, the battle for the Talmeranian Castle was one of the worst battle scenes i've ever experienced. THe gryffen's are the only cool thing at all, everything else is so cluttered, and the camera angles are unforgiving, it was just garbage. Then the white witch has a thirty second cameo after a god-awful creature's chanting. That was kind of cool, and then the big battle scene is about to unfold. Then the most exciting duel in a movie i've ever seen happened between Peter, and the Talmeranian King. THat was awesome, the intensity of the moment was done well, and it was a treat. Finally, after a quick betrayal, the final battle unfolds. And it was great, just perfect. I mean, it was LOTR awesome. Then the movie ends with an awful love song, and a completely dull kiss between Caspian and Susan. Overall, a lot of great cgi, and battles save this otherwise dull, bad plotted movie. 7.5/10",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
259,nameesh,Superb movie but alittle long one :),8,16 May 2008,"It sure was a much anticipated movie. Expected a lot from it but somehow it lacked in the pacing of the movie.I am not sure of which location the picture has been shot but it was superb I mean, you feel as though you are making to a neverfound land yourself. It sure was a big surprise seeing 2 of the characters in the movies growing old. I mean, the cute looking gal character in ""Lucy"" seemed so sweet to look at in the 1st part but then her character somehow dint have the appeal. Edmund characters also dint seem to offer the strength. Though the characters Peter and Susan did do a good job at the movie.Some of the best moments of the movies included the shots taken while they are finding the fellow Narnians and also the one where the prince is running away from his own kingdom while being chased by his own soldiers. It pretty scenic and the picturization is superb. Must say that the scene where the calm water runs to a ferocious force was also also enjoyable, thought i reminded me of some other movie with the desert monster (forgot the name of the movie ;)) The little mouse character was also pretty sweet.The biggest let-down for the movie was I thought in the 2nd half when the army attacks the Narnians. The battle seemed to drag along quite abit. Fight sequences and the time after war could have been cut short :)Overall, its a very enjoyable movie watching experience. Of course, the best character in the movie is the King Azlan. In fact, it truly deserves to be called the King of the Animals :)",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
260,darthyagi,Whoa. . .,9,16 May 2008,"When I first heard that Prince Caspian was going to be the next film released, my wife and I were excited, but she was a little apprehensive. We have a tendency to compare the two relentlessly, and we are quite picky when we compare things.In the beginning moments of Prince Caspian, it shows the Prince, picking up with his story the night his cousin, Miraz' son is born. This storyline continues for a time, until Caspian blows Susan's horn, summoning the children back to Narnia.For the most part, this film is quite faithful to Lewis' original story. As mentioned above, some things have been moved around in order to streamline the movie. Starting with Caspian instead of the children was different, but not necessarily bad. All of the changes, minor though they are, are there in order to simplify the overall story, making it easier to follow. My hat goes off to the director for making that choice -- it may have been a risky move when it comes to fans like my wife and I, but it really pays off when you talk to people who aren't as picky about details.All that being said, Prince Caspian was an incredible movie. It moves along quickly and with determination. Slower sequences don't drag, and action sequences pack a punch. Fans of the book and newcomers to Narnia can all enjoy this film, and comes highly recommended from two die-hard fans of C.S. Lewis' seven masterpieces.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
261,ksarkies,Amazingly Good,10,21 July 2008,"I'm not a movie fan and only tolerate going to movies because I love my wife who likes me to come. However I was surprised when this movie finished to find that I had not once become bored - a new experience. It's a while since I read the book and I couldn't remember the details, which is probably A Good Thing. My impression of the movie though is that it kept fairly close to Lewis's understanding of the way God is and how he treats us. The movie may disappoint those who are looking for a Superman/Batman style. The heroes are not superheroes, nor are they anti-heroes. Instead they have to face up to trusting in one they know is watching after them, but whom they cannot see and who does not make the way forward obvious.(Edit after reading the book again) The most serious criticism of the film is the way Peter's character was totally misrepresented. It is clear that the film authors have not understood his maturity as shown in the book. Most of the changes between the book and the film centre on Peter's modified character, which has been changed from a gracious and chivalrous leader to a belligerent, impetuous, bumbling and rather stupidly stubborn person who seems to have learnt nothing from his previous encounter with Aslan.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
262,diego_castro_95,"Well done, you repaired what you had done",8,18 August 2008,"Wow. When my aunt told me to go and watch this movie I really didn't wanted to. After The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe I thought this movie was going to be some kind of boring and childish. But what a surprise. It was amazing!!! First of all the plot is more complex than the first one. Second of all the effects are really awesome, the water man that comes out of the river is great. And the final battle is way much better than the other one. Third of all, this a much darker sequel. Being more to the juvenile public, than for kids. Last of all, great action, the battle between Peter and the telmarine king is a very good one, and at the moment I don't have other action parts in my head, but from what I remember all of them were pretty nice. The only thing I didn't like was Aslan saving everything again without having to move a muscle. That takes out excitement and curiosity about how things will end. If it's a Narnia movie you will always know that at the end Aslan saves the day with a big roar.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
263,ivangudjon,A good movie gone ridiculous.,2,3 November 2008,"I like the first movie very much and rated it highly but this movie just doesn't make much sense at all. This movie is about pirates that found a magical cave that led them to Narnia, a land full of magic. For some reason they decided to attack the creatures living in Narnia and won the battle, which doesn't make any sense comparing their strengths. Some Narnians fled to the forest and survived while the pirates bred and took control of the land. Then one day, for some unknown reason, this Prince called Caspian is almost killed by his power thirst nephew that wants the crown. For some reason he has a private tutor who is son of a female dwarf and a man, kinky..., and this tutor teaches him about the history of Narnia and so on. Then he gives him this horn to blow if he is in need while he is escaping from his nephew. He goes to the forest and gets endangered and blows the horn so our heroes from the first movie come to the rescue. For some reason Aslan doesn't give a damn about Narnia, but his logic is that ,,things never happen the same twice"" which is just absurd. His actual reason for letting loads of his creature friend die without doing anything about it is that things never happen the same twice. Come on, that really sucks. I mean he has the power to wake up the forest, make trees attack and call his water-friend to come to the rescue, but still he doesn't until Lucy finds him. You know why? BECAUSE THINGS NEVER HAPPEN THE SAME TWICE. Then of course there is the attack on the castle, why the hell didn't Caspian just kill his nephew to get this over with, and why did his nephew's wife shoot Caspian even after his nephew admitted having killed Caspian's father. That is just one of the few things that don't make sense, like why didn't the mighty creatures that could jump 5 meters just jump on the archers to win the battle? Were they really to occupied killing the infantry? And why were the guard's reactions so normal, if you were a guard and saw a minotaur wielding a weapon, would you scream WHAAAT? or would you take up your sword without saying a thing or even looking surprised? I know I'd scream and get the hell out of there. And when Caspian is tempted to join the ice queen, where did those 2 creeps come from? They just appeared out of nothing, and some kids ****ed them up in a battle. That really isn't right, some kids, no matter how well they're trained, killing some supernatural bad creatures that have super strength and can jump like flying frogs. That is like watching Karate Kid when they beat the hell out of those 30 year old trained fighters (blindfolded too) that apparently are against guns like in all kick-punch movies. And why didn't they run to the forest after the tomb or whatever it was closed down? The forest is their home ground after all. No, instead of tactical retreat and almost sure victory they decided to go on a suicide mission which was saved by Aslan after hugging and kissing Lucy for a while. And why did they know that Lucy and Raymond would come back but the other two wouldn't? That too was just very stupid.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
264,FantasyFan17,Much better than the first,8,2 November 2008,"First off, I would just like to take the time to say that the first one was good, but this one is much better. The acting is better, the scenery is (oh...) beautiful, there is more action, and the music was really good. I have seen it three times, and when it comes out on DVD, I am putting it on my Christmas wish-list (but first I'll rent it. I did the same with Pirates of the Caribbean 2&3) for sure. The best parts were the raid on the Telmarine castle and when Prince Caspian escapes the castle at the beginning. Reepicheep has his moments. The only part I didn't like was with the hag/wolf-type thing and the witch. I thought that was the only flaw. Other than that, it is a good movie. I highly recommend it to anyone over the age eight.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
265,JOhlendorf,"decent movie, with several flaws",5,1 November 2008,"i will make this short. its not a bad movie, but neither a great one. My girlfriend and I liked the first movie much better. now for the Pros and Contras.on the one hand: Technically the movie was good. Decent animations that fitted perfectly into the movie. A decent idea for a story, that tries to combine humor, adventure and action. But......but on the other hand: Who has read the book, will be disappointed, how very different the movie is. Then again who did not read the book, may have trouble understanding the first 15 minutes right away. The The focus of the movie is on action scenes, and character development had to make space for those.Then what really annoyed me, was that this movie looked like a cheap copy of Lord of the Rings. Many say this about any fantasy movie, but i would disagree most of the time. But this one sure is stealing quite a lot, not only from LOTR. I will not go into details (dont want to spoil), but two examples:I Reepicheep, the newly introduced character is very original. Change $mouse to $cat and you got....""Puss in Boots"" (If you have seen Shrek2 or 3). II ...the enemy is attacking through the deep river... when suddenly (who has seen LOTR?) a big water wave comes and crushes them. Alright, i admit, this time the wave forms into some water giant, not water horses...Then another mood killer, the never ending ending-scene (again, hardly anyone an endless ending like in LOTR, where you get hit with a very unfitting song. Why not put a rap song into it, would have been as badly placed as this kind of music.Last but not least, i don't like it at all, when the things that happen do not make any sense. In this movie, people appear out of nowhere, do things when they should have just done them 5 minutes earlier to ""save the world"". Susan for example does bot shoot an imminent threat to her sisters live, but does not hesitate to kill a man she just saw for a few seconds, not knowing who he is, not being threatened at all. all in all its a watchable movie, which is just a bit ill, by the current ""more wild senseless action scenes""- epidemic, that seem to have hit Hollywood.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
266,suntonova,"Pretty, but lacking substance",5,20 May 2008,"No complaints can be made about the technical aspects of this second installment to C. S. Lewis's The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian. The animation was good to excellent, costumes were well done (if uninspired), sets were good and cinematography was done well. Little complaints can be made about the acting; many of the supporting cast were excellent, including the despicable Miraz (veteran Italian actor Sergio Castellitto in his English debut) and the-grump-with-a-heart-of-gold, Trumpkin (Peter Dinklage of 2007's ""Death at a Funeral""). Prince Caspian (relative newcomer Ben Barnes of 2007's ""Stardust"") performed well and even managed a sufficiently convincing Castilian accent. The only notable weak point in the cast was Lucy (what can I say, Georgie Henley is no Dakota Fanning). However, this movie just leaves the viewer uninspired. Even with almost 2.5 hours at his disposal this Oscar-Nominated writer/director fails to manage sufficient character development, many motivations were unclear and in the end you just didn't feel for the characters what they obviously wanted you to. On the other hand, my hunch is that if you're between the ages of 10 and 15, and especially if you're also a girl (Prince Caspian is pretty easy on the eyes), you'll love it so much that you'll see it multiple times, dragging your friends along with you, and come this fall you'll even buy the licensed trapper keeper.http://zombiehor.de/",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

In fact I expected too much and in the first half I wondered if the movie was living upto my expectation though its was going on great.. But once the movie was over, I knew that it had lived upto my expectation! In my words if I simply put it, it was amazing.. After being quite crazy about the first Narnia movie (had watched a major chunk of it daily for more than a month) you can imagine what high hopes I had for the second one. And It was great, in animation, storyline, acting and direction! For me it felt totally different from the first movie in some ways. The background is the same and theme similar, but the movie felt like it had a more serious note to it. As usual I loved the character of Lucy, and Aslan also was great though his part was not that much. I liked Edmund also more than last time.. And of course, Prince Caspian also came out great! The battle scenes are great, animation was better than last time, but in some ways I liked the battle of the first one.. maybe because it was a bigger and grander one, with more people fighting on either side..

269,jar1642,"An over-long, boring disappointment",2,17 May 2008,"Disney continues the C.S. Lewis' Narnia tales, but this time makes a boring, over-long, disappointing movie.The setup: After returning to England for a year, the four Pevensie siblings respond to a horn calling for help and return to the magical land of Narnia, only to find that in Narnia 1,300 years have passed. Their old castle is in ruins, and it develops that Narnia has been conquered by some people called Telmarines, who have the accents, spade beards, and helmets of stereotypical Spanish conquistadors. Prince Caspian, who called for help, is one of'em, but his uncle wants him dead so the uncle can become king. The intrepid Pevensie quartet size up the situation and decide to help Caspian and simultaneously rid Narnia of the invaders, with the aid of the usual Narnian characters, including dwarfs, centaurs, a talking badger, and a talkative mouse whose manner & dialog were stolen from Antonio Banderas' Puss-in-Boots in ""Shrek 2"". Aslan makes a brief but effective (plotwise) appearance near the end but my fave villainess, Tilda Swinton as the White Witch, has only an all-too-short cameo.I thought the plot was erratically developed and the dialog occasionally funny but pretty much unimaginatively routine for high-fantasy stories. My big problem was that I was never brought to care for any of the characters, whose motivations are murky. The young cast put no emotion into their parts.I found myself realizing that I was bored several times during the flick's 2 hour & 24 minute length. The whole purpose of the movie seemed to be just to set up the big climactic CGI battle at the end. Unfortunately, the CGI was not up to Peter Jackson's standards, even tho it included a forest of trees that turned into Ents and a flood that copied a scene from ""The Fellowship of the Ring"".My favorite moment came in a scene toward the end, when Prince Caspian had his evil uncle at sword point, with both characters talking in their Spanish accents. I wanted to yell out the perfect line for our hero to say: ""My name is Prince Caspian. You murdered my father. Prepare to die!"" Heck, since most of the flick was derivative of the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies, why not throw in some ""Princess Bride"", too?",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
270,maian_magus,Not TOO bad...,7,22 May 2008,"It wasn't too bad, much better than the first, which far more action. Whereas the first movie seemed to me to be a lot of wandering around (see Randal's description of Lord of the Rings in Clerks 2), this one had much more point. The beginning confused me for a few, but it wasn't long at all until you were thrown into the action. This movie really doesn't feel like 2 hours long- it goes by quite fast and has some very energetic scenes, and most of the action scenes are done well and are fun to watch.Unfortunately, it's thick with Jesus. Like, soaked. I know C.S. Lewis was a pretty religious guy but I was hoping to not see it as obviously as I did, like in the first, where the religious comments were there, but not so bloody obvious. I mean, at one point, Jesus actually makes an appearance himself (you'll know it when you see it- this isn't much of a spoiler I hope).Anyways, like I said, good action, better than the first as far as mindless wandering goes, but dripping with Bibleness.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
271,Masmill7,Not as Spectacular but pretty good,7,17 May 2008,"This was a big improvement over the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe, do to it being much more epic. The battle scenes were extremely well done and were full of plenty of action. Action was something the Lion the Witch and Wardrobe lacked, and Prince Caspian had a lot of. The action put into Prince Caspian made it an enjoyable movie for both teens and children, unlike The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe which was mainly made for younger children and their parents. I did not dislike the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe but Prince Caspian still beats it because it had more of a mature and darker plot, with still the brightness and color for family's to enjoy. The bottom line is Prince Caspian was a fun enjoyable family movie, but take my advice, family's should really look this over before they take their much younger kids to see this movie. The PG rating was very off, this had enough violence to have a PG-13 rating. I don't know many PG movies that have extremely intense battle scenes, and duals that involve beheading. Take my rating into account, its much more realistic.Offcial MPAA Rating:Rated PG for epic battle action and violenceMy Rating:PG-13 for Intense Battle Sequences and Frightening Images",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
272,magpie_otoole25,Absolutely Amazing !!,10,21 May 2008,"I was extremely excited for this movie to come out, but I was a little worried that I would be disappointed because I am a huge fan of the books. I can honestly say that this movie is the only movie I have ever seen that I have liked as much as the book. Unlike the Harry Potter series, the first two Narnia movies have stayed to the same details as the books and have even added more.I thought the cast was excellent. The young actors are after coming a long way from the first movie in regards to their acting. They were brilliant. They have matured so much between the two films its unbelievable. And Ben Barnes was amazing! I actually didn't expect Prince Caspian to be so good looking.I also thought that the romance between Susan and Caspian was so cute. It wasn't in the book but I think that it worked really well with the movie and I am really glad that it was there.I would totally recommend this movie to all viewers, especially those who enjoyed the first.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
273,netnacool,Boring! but i didn't expect much,4,18 May 2009,"Well, i watched the first movie and i enjoyed it thoroughly but i was 14 years old then and any movie with good cinematic were a treat for me. But now when i enjoy a good plot and well knit characters in a movie than splendid backgrounds and animations i was really disappointed. I wouldn't say that the movie didn't have potential. Take the movie ""Bridge to Terabithia "" for example, i would have liked the movie as much as i liked it 2 years ago for it was a very well made movie. Also i didn't expected much from the movie because my brother told me he slept after half way through the movie. Now i know why :) Well clearly many people did enjoy the movie, but in my opinion the movie never really had the charm and freshness of the last movie. The last movie was just a wonderful watch for me as a kid. I think that was the biggest reason i watched the second part after hearing not so good about it . Another thing, my brother loves the first part too (he was 16 then)",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
274,odinbetafish,As good as the first and that's alright...,6,21 May 2008,Over all Narnia 2 wasn't terrible. It took a large leap from the book to draw in more audiences. In the end it was just as good as the first which wasn't the greatest but didn't suck. If you're a family or you like fantasy films I suggest it. If you're looking for a good epic movie. Steer clear. It was basically a pretty boy contest between the two lead actors filled in with an some cool battle sequences and centaurs. There was a disappointing face time for two of the main characters from the first film. In the end I give The Chronicles of Naria: Price Caspian a 6. Hopefully The Chronicles of Narnia: The Dawn Treader will raise the level for the future of these films.,The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
275,hony-4,Knocked me out of my seat!,9,16 May 2008,"Now I was really excited to see this on opening day, but many of my friends said that they would see it the next day. I was expecting for the film to be just like the first one, boring until the final battle in the end. This was one of the best movies I have ever seen in my entire life!In this film, you can tell that the writers and directors took more time into this film and added twice as many effects as the first. The effects were sweet, the acting was good for the most part, and the screenplay was amazing.This movie kept me off my seat from the very beginning. Every element in this movie was balanced to perfection. The film was a lot darker than I expected it to be, so I guess that's why I thought it was so good. The only thing that would have made this movie better is if they added some more blood. They could have easily made this movie look like the movie 300. Its a kid movie though, so I can understand why they would want to tone it down to a PG movie, but I was actually surprised that it was a PG movie by how dark it was, I mean I was a little freaked out at times. A little more blood would make this film a worthy adversary to the ""Lord of the Rings.""After watching the movie, I read the first half of the book the day after, and yes, there had been some things added and taken out of the film, but I never really saw it as too much of a big deal. An example would be the scene with the werewolf and the hag. Everyone is complaining that Caspian was never temped, but if you read the chapter, the really was. The film just got deeper and more darker into the sequence, but I though that it was twice as better as if they just kept it the way the book was written (I love the book by the way).The only bad thing that I have to say about the movie would be the thing that Susan and Caspian had, especially since Susan doesn't even come back to the last book (Peter, Edmund, and Lucy return one last time in ""The Last Battle"" but Susan doesn't because she had ""grown up."" It was pointless and it showed that they added it so that they could get the media on it, just like every other Hollywood film.I would have to say that this film is about 10 times better than the first, and is an astounding sequel to the original film. This is the movie that any die hard Narnia fan has been waiting for!",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
276,beenhavingfun,Prince Caspian: Good not Great,7,17 May 2008,"I'm kinda a hard critic (I really hate to be one, but I am). This movie, in my opinion, is way better than the first. But that still doesn't make it great. I'm unbiased on this movie because I haven't read this book (I have read some of the others). Now let's start with what's good in this movie. First the action is way more epic than the first. There is no let down there. In fact thats probably why this movie was any good, because of how epic it felt. I was also drawn in by the Narnia creatures, they were more realistic in this one. The plot put a good twist on what could have been generic. Coming back to Narnia 1300 years later, when it was more evil, was a good idea. The white which scene was really good. I thought it showed the internal conflict within Caspian and the lack thereof in Edmund. Edmund and Lucy(don't know the actors names) were amazing. Their acting was very well done. In a scene where Lucy sees Asland( I always cringe when the character goes *smiling* ""Asland???!!!???"") she actually pulled off that line very well. Another great thing about this film is that it is way funnier than the first. All of these points are well worth ten stars, but only if it wasn't for the bad parts. There are three major things(three stars) that make this movie good instead of great. First the beginning. It wasn't gripping at all, maybe just my opinion, and made me feel I was in store for a really bad movie(it wasn't bad). Second reason is the acting of the other two kids( I am so glad they are gone in the next one). An example; Peter always comes off as whiny, its very annoying. Peter is also always saying little catch phrases like, ""For Narnia"", and ,""Charge""(Says each about ten times) Sarah comes off as snobbish and without emotion. Finally the ending is terrible. It was very cheesy when the main villain is killed and another guys steps up and says OK lets still fight. But even worse is how the water guy(painfully like LOTR's) eats the new villain. Then when Caspian kisses Sarah at the end. It would have been alright if there had been any(I mean any) chemistry between them, but there wasn't! Also when Aslan appears its like,""OK, You've been looking for me for the whole movie (not to mention letting Narnia go to the pits in 1300 years) many Narnians have died but now since you've found I'm gonna make everything perfect."" Seemed a little cheesy to me. This movie looked as if it could have been great, but the truth is it wasn't. I think the series is getting better with each new installment and so this one is a sign of how the next one could be great. The reason I give this movie seven stars is that although it may not be amazing in every way it was still very fun to watch.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
277,kevin-1750,Book lovers need to remember we are in 2008 - a sound film was some sad Disneyesque twists,8,29 June 2008,"When I first heard that Disney were remaking the Chronicles of Narnia, I was devastated. I thought we'd end up with something twee, screaming family WASP values and shoving morals down our throat. I know CS Lewis put all of these into his books, but he did so in a much more crafted and literary way than Disney normally achieve. When I saw LtW&W I was pleasantly surprised. I have always been a massive devotee of the books, and thought they'd stuck to it fairly closely.Prince Caspian was not my favourite book. It was not my favourite not because of the writing, but because of the subject matter. Unlike the first few books, it isn't all magical and fluffy but gritty and depressing. It is violent, provocative and devastating. I wondered how Disney would ever manage that.Amazingly, they almost pulled it off. The grit, violence and action are certainly there and parts are emotional and depressing. I was concerned that Aslan sounded like a cheesy anchorman, I was worried that all the bad guys had darker skin, I was concerned that the effects, score and action had more of a role than the story in parts and I was furious with the song at the end.However, I recognise that we live in a very different world to CS Lewis. The morals and ideals he embedded in his books were relevant to the people of post-war Britain, not the international movie audience. By looking at a possible romance between Susan and Caspian, by adding in the temptation to the white witch bit and by ensuring the cheesy action sequences that modern movies need to succeed, Disney managed to, subtly, add some relevance to modern times, without overriding Lewis' original point.All in all and excellent film, easily on par with the first and probably better. As we progress through the chronicles, however, we need to ensure that the films don't go any further down the line of selling out to the modern audience, or the wonderful magic of the originals may be lost.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
278,Swrdqst,A brilliant adaption of the book & an Excellent movie!,10,16 May 2008,"I saw this at the midnight screening last night. There were so many people there to see it they opened up additional screens. The audience loved it and applauded, understandably so. It was truly brilliant! The book is only 223 pages, so they did enhance it as would be expected, but the new & original material was seamlessly blended and in spirit with the book, so it worked perfectly to create an excellent movie that is the best film of 2008! The state of the art special effects are amazing & perfect in creating the Narnian characters and events, without being just more cool visual effects. They are are a natural and integral part of the movie experience which is truly fantastic. The humor is enjoyable and well placed. The acting is top notch, the story moves well and fully engages the audience. This is a 10++++ out of 10 and the best film of the year. Definitely worth seeing again.

They found out old Narnia was not the same as it used to be. They go on an adventure to save the Narnians. I think the actors and actresses were very good in their roles. They played them very well and made you believe they were really Lewis' characters. All the stunts and fight scenes were very good and cool. Peter and Caspian got along in the book but did not get along in the movie. I'm not sure why they made it like this, but it made for a little spice in the movie. My favorite part was when the mouse found out he lost his tail. The graphics were cool and very real. All of the animals looked so real and actually alive – they could talk and walk like that in real life. Other than that I would definitely recommend this to a friend; it was a very good movie and book.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
280,krazykiter,"OK as a movie, disappointing if you read the book",4,2 January 2009,"IF you're looking for a fantasy-action movie shorter than The Lord of the Rings, this might be for you. If you're looking for a reasonable movie version of the beloved C. S. Lewis novel, you are in for, at best, a rude disappointment. This is doubly disappointing considering the deliberate care Andrew Adamson took with The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe to keep Lewis' storyline intact. The few scenes Adamson added in that movie did not significantly change the storyline. In fact, the opening sequence of the previous movie is arguably necessary to establish the reason the children went to stay with Professor Kirke in the first place.Granted, the two convergent plots in the book version of Prince Caspian make a screen adaptation tricky, but I have little doubt a director as talented as Adamson could have pulled it off nicely. As is, many of the plot subtleties in the book are completely absent.The treatment of Peter and Susan was abysmal. Peter comes off as a stubborn, know-it-all bully and the romantic subplot between Caspian and Susan is just ridiculous. Furthermore, having Susan in the battle sequences is utterly crass political correctness.The book isn't about what Peter and Susan learn from their return to Narnia, it is about what *Caspian and the Telmarines* learn about themselves, their ancestry and their place among the other races in Narnia.Any movie adaptation of a book, especially one as well-known and -loved as this one, is difficult and never totally perfect. In this case however, given the excellent job done on the first movie, it is a disappointing one.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
281,ladypredator,Pleased at Heart,10,17 August 2009,"EXCELLENT MOVIE! Adamson did it again! Every detail of the movie is unforgettable! Small 1 minute scenes like Prince Caspian's room backgrounds months of work.In Prince Caspian though, I felt sorrow just like the 1st 1 - where Aslan was sacrificed on the Stone Table. But in here, I realized more about how every talking animal is ready to die for a Greater Narnia. Very self-sacrificing, makes me realize how strong faith is. Although Aslan didn't appear to defend whats left of Narnia until the end of the film, Lucy (Georgie) had faith in Aslan's return and that is what SAVED the day! Relating to the Bible again, although this world is ruled by evil and GOD seems unreal, he IS THERE and with faith (like Lucy) you will find GOD (like Lucy going to find Aslan) and WIN - its HOW and WHO you believe. Even despite the challenges Lucy has, especially still believing in Aslan when the rest of every1 gave up on him, she DID. Her relationship with Aslan is expressed very well in Prince Caspian.Ill end this review here bc if I don't stop now, you'll be reading forever. But think about the concepts of this book.

282,michael-mcgee-969-357319,Do not waste your time with this,3,8 August 2011,"The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian is one of the biggest flops since Batman & Robin(1997). After enjoying and appreciating the first ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" for what it was, a feel-good family movie, it's disappointing to see such a hugely anticipated sequel fall so flat.I know, I can't be hyper-critical of this film as it's a Disney film and aimed at a young audience. However, the script is so predictable, substandard and alarmingly poor. The acting throughout the movie is inadequate and more of an eye-sore than anything. Worse yet, the ""acting"" of young William Moseley(King Peter) is quite simply atrocious. Nevertheless, the characters are still lovable from the first installment, especially Lucy, if not more.So, for anybody planning to watch this, I highly advise that you do not waste your time with this film. However, if you do go ahead with this movie, do not expect much as this film will not reach the lowest of expectations.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
283,mgens,Purists and Christians unite... kinda:,1,10 June 2008,"As someone who knows the books by heart, and who loves them (while recognizing some of their faults, both as children's literature and as allegorical theology), I was curious to see Prince Caspian. I was prepared for Caspian to not look like the Caspian in my childhood memory - the invention of the imagination spurred by reading written words... almost an archaic exercise, somewhat, these days. However, I was not prepared for a film that was such a bad film. While many of the effects were nicely realized (if at times superfluous, to say the least), the editing was poor, and the writing was worse, even if one had not read the book and left aside the critique of faithfulness to the Lewis original. This was just not a good film, all those ridiculous battles and anachronistic (meaning 2008 anachronistic, not even 1940s) teenage patter to the contrary. You'll tell me that the book is full of battles. Hmm.Well, if the book is to be the measure, then we enter a different realm of critique, with different criteria, no? From that point of view, bloody or not, the movie was a travesty, and a silly one at that, with poor dialogue and absolutely none - I repeat, NONE - of the woodland-medieval-renaissance-magic-chock-full-o-lore of the book.One can only hope that a book like 'The Voyage of the Dawn Treader' will be seen as the ready-made adventure story it already is, and will not suffer too much from screenwriter hubris when it, too, comes to the chopping block.Have a little faith in the moviegoer's desire to see a good story told with subtlety, complexity, and thoroughness. That's the appeal of the books. Why needlessly invent the wheel via a DaDa-like cut and paste pastiche approach? My main puzzlement, though, comes from seeing that Douglas Gresham is listed as a co-producer in the opening credits. For years, Lewis's stepson resisted various offers to the film rights to the books, judging them all not worthy of the originals, holding out for a production team that would do them justice (and do it with kindness, too). What was the man thinking? Did money win in the end? Does he really think that a good job was done with Prince Caspian? Only the next film will tell - please do a better job, Disney folks.Mark from Brattleboro",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
284,ailsaz,"Pleasant movie, though not spectacularly.",6,18 June 2008,"The first Narnia movie is probably my favorite movie of all time--I loved the plot line, the characters, the special effects, and how well everything wrapped together emotionally with the characters.This film, however, I felt that the story lay a bit flat. Here is my analysis of the characters: Ben Barnes gave a not-so-great performance as Prince Caspian. I do not feel any sort of connection to his character whatsoever, and his ""heartfelt"" speech to the Narnians about standing together and fighting the Telmarines did not trigger any emotional effect in me. I felt Ben Barnes, though incredibly good-looking, did not exhibit a believable, multi-dimensional title role.William Moseley, did brilliantly as the oldest Pevensie in LWW--his character turned from a timid child on his own to a young man. Now in Prince Caspian, Moseley has regressed back into a timid child. Had I not been familiar with Chronicles of Narnia, I would not have guessed Peter was the oldest Pevensie child from his acting, for Susan and Edmund have mentally outgrown him.I must give Anna Popplewell props for her portrayal as Susan, for her character is quite different from the one in the books and she almost pulls it off. She plays a convincingly intelligent and fierce warrior, though I say she ""almost"" pulls off her character due to the atrocity of a fling between herself and Prince Caspian. As many Narnia fans have pointed out, Peter had more chemistry with Caspian than Susan did: the awkward cliché love scenes felt forced and out of place.Skandar Keynes as Edmund was absolutely brilliant. Keynes plays a very convincing role as the mischeivous black sheep of the family. His role in the overall plot line of PC is much less significant than his role in LWW (in fact you can say he is ""the Susan"" of PC) but he plays his character with such confidence that you believe this was the authentic Edmund Pevensie, not an actor portraying him.Georgie Henley as Lucy is incredibly precious--she maintains the child-like innocence she had in her first movie, and the tendency she had of overacting in LWW has toned down so much she becomes the believable Lucy Pevensie of the stage. I felt that the two younger Pevensie children have a bright acting future ahead of them, and I'll be excited to see them in Voyage of the Dawn Treader.Peter Dinklage makes a fantastic Trumpkin, and his serious-but-fun character was a delight to watch on the screen. Despite playing a non-human character, Dinklage gives his character such a strong persona that I believe he brings the movie well to life.The movie was a bit too dark for me--CS Lewis' books were targeted towards young children, and this movie would downright make his targeted audience burst out crying and disrupt older viewers. This movie simply did not unwrap the magic and wonder of Narnia that the first movie had, though overall I found the movie to be mildly enjoyable.Something else I found annoying about the movie was the number of cliché scenes it had: Susan helping Prince Caspian aim his bow, Prince Caspian having King Miraz at his whim and sparing him after a long pause, and Prince Caspian's ""rescue"" of Susan after she takes out five horsemen with her arrows.Basically, my main problem with the movie was the Susan/Caspian romance. However, the movie also had its great moments: the clashing of sword-on-sword, the heart-wrenching scene of the gates closing down on half of the Narnians in the night raid, and the wonderful moment Lucy shared with Aslan as she asks him why he hasn't helped them.I left the movie feeling rather content, though it still left quite a bit to be desired. I give it 6 out of 10 stars.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

Great production, true to the story line, lots of nail biting and fascinating.It never felt like it was over two hours. I'd have to say that Walden did an amazing job of staying true to the storyline and that Disney's magic is back. I will recommend this movie and absolutely plan on adding the DVD to my library when it comes out. I may even go and pay to see it again.The only recommendation I have is to continue with the other 5 books. I've seen every one of the productions of The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe, and it took Disney to make it right. Now they've continued with Prince Caspian, and I'm anything BUT disappointed.

286,titus_larcius,Lacks Depth,4,17 May 2008,"This was a great disappointment, especially compared to Adamson's first effort in the Narnia series. Without the help of a great actor to carry the picture, like Swinton, it fell way short of the mark and was sorely lacking in depth. The acting was mostly awful (in particular Peter Dinklage, who was especially cringe-worthy), the characters were one-dimensional, the effects, costumes, and make-up were noticeably quite poor (certainly not as good as they were in the first film), and the whole feel of the movie was overly melodramatic (at times I felt like I was watching a Shakespearean stage-play, what with some of the dialogue).

The use of color in the settings, costumes and special effects is incredible! The animals are beautifully done, and the settings are teeming with vibrant color and texture.These are beautiful interpretations of Lewis' books. Though the movies are essentially simple stories, that keeps to the spirit of the books themselves. I think Lewis would heartily approve, not just of the way the story is produced, and the color, but the casting choices are very appropriate. I really feel that these movies keep in the spirit of the original story, and I'm absolutely in love with the color (in case you can't tell!) I also find my imagination peaked by the magical and fun feel of the film. I am captured first by the color and then by the lovely story. Even the ending is bittersweet.

288,shadowed_rain115,Worth it!,9,26 May 2008,"I've been waiting for this movie to come out ever since the first one, and it was worth every bit of the wait! Prince Caspian has a much darker theme, darker undertones, and is far more mature than the other film. It feel that it's appropriate considering the book and the subject, but I was very interested in the direction that Andrew Adamson took the movie. The movie did deviate from the book quite a bit, but that's to be expected with any book- turned-movie project. There were several battle scenes added, as well as several subplots (some of which were better written than others) and situations to add to the overall theme of the movie. I felt that some of the more subtle aspects of Lewis' story were explored more deeply, and the results were enormously rewarding for the audience to see, and benefited the movie greatly. I was very impressed with the casting in this movie, especially with the appearances of Ben Barnes and Peter Dinklage. The Pevensie siblings were all excellent in their roles, and it's nice to see the amount of maturity that all of them have brought into their roles in this movie. It's difficult to say if it's appropriate for a young audience...there's a lot of themes and nuances that I think would go over their heads, and it's in many ways a more mature movie for a more mature audience. I wouldn't bring any kids under the age of 10 to see it, unless they're die-hard Narnia fans. This was an excellent movie, and I fully intend to see it a third time!",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
289,bluebrando,Doesn't live up to the hype,5,23 May 2008,"This movie was pretty interesting to watch, but it had a lot of faults. Yet again, I feel like this movie had so much more potential- just like the first one. It often feels like I am watching a child's version of Lord of the Rings. Yes, I know it is directed towards children, but kids don't need cheesy comments or cheesy acting to enjoy a movie. Also, I don't understand the dramatic female vocals towards the end of both movies. I don't feel like it goes at all with the movie. This movie seemed to have something missing. All there was to it was the kids came back to Narnia, found out what was going on, fought a lot, and then left. The whole ""romance"" between Susan and Caspian was absolutely pointless. First of all, I think they spoke to each other about two or three times, and kept it brief. Then she left? They made it seem like all it was was two teenagers full of hormones...and it was like the creators of the movie decided to throw that in there last minute to attract a broader audience. I think the lack of blood during battle is pointless. There's no need to hide the fact that people have blood running through their veins. A child learns that the first time he/she scrapes their knee. As long as it isn't excessive in a ""Kill Bill"" way, I think it's appropriate. On another note, why was Edmund put into the background so often? He hardly spoke 5 lines!",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
290,CandleKel,Reading is Overrated!,2,17 May 2008,"Well, with SO many good movies coming out this summer, Caspian was one that was up on my list. I knew that they were making it, so I read the book to my daughter last year, and I was really excited. And you have to understand that having 2 small children and trying to get to a movie is no small feat. However, we made our escape tonight to a later showing. So, after seeing ""The Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe"", I thought Caspian would be the same. By same I mean, like thinking the writers of the screenplay had actually READ THE BOOK! I was SO disappointed (thinking in my head during the movie...should have seen Ironman...should have seen Ironman...should have seen Ironman)!Sorry, but these C.S. Lewis books are near and dear to their fans hearts and I felt like the Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe stuck SO closely to the book and did such a fabulous job at adding only inconsequential fillers. I really feel that was just BAIT to get us to see the rest of them. I can NOT recommend this movie, Caspian, because it felt like the screen writer used his teenage daughter to help cast it and help write it. For those of us in our party who had NOT read the book, the reviews were mixed. One fell asleep; one thought it was disconnected and didn't make sense; two liked it because they are TEENAGERS! So, if you are a teenager, and can't READ...then go for it baby!!! AND if you're a girl teenager, Caspian is HOT (I kept expecting him to fling his hair like Prince Charming in Shrek2) and Peter is looking fine and Edmund is adorable and will be mega-handsome as he ages. But, if you are over 25 and HAVE read the book...stay home (or go see Ironman).I really, really believe that it would have been even MORE exciting had they stuck closer to the story and events of the book. What a great story!!! I just don't get why they didn't. There's NO love interest between Susan and Caspian (actually, I do think that Caspian should have been MUCH younger too). They don't ever go back to the castle do they? One of the best parts of the story (book) was Trumpkin's disbelief and wonderful revelation at seeing Aslan for the first time. Of course these Narnians didn't believe about Aslan either, he'd been gone for like 1,300 years! So, they all were TOO quick to believe. And I have to say there was NO character development for Doctor Cornelius either. That's so sad since he really is one of the VERY main characters! Why change also that Caspian didn't just get knocked out when he hit a tree and then woke up (and WHY in the HECK was Trumpkin gone already???) So, so many errors and unnecessary changes...ARG! Peter and Caspian do NOT fight. Peter doesn't have any ""problems"" as portrayed in the film. What the heck was going on in that screenwriter's head (or his teenage daughter's)???? WAY, WAY too many things were different! There was NO White Witch (and by the way, HOW do you kill someone who is already dead?). She was merely talked about. I did NOT expect the story to be completely changed in SO many parts. Hey, you know you shouldn't screw with a Mom who can only get out a few times a year. Crap, the last movie we saw in the theaters was Transformers...can't you give a girl a break??? I was SO distracted by the lack of following the story, that I don't even think I could tell you if I would have liked it having not read the book. Very disappointed Disney, Walden, whomever! Shame on you! If you liked the book, you won't like the movie. Just see the Lion, Witch and Wardrobe again and it will make it alright.

291,mattriley3,Good adaptation of the book...,8,18 May 2008,"This film is nothing short of amazing. The script was very well-written and the action never seems to stop after the introductory sequences of the four English children we all know so well from its predecessor. Unfortunately there were spots where the acting looked less than stellar but all in all, the movie follows the book in that it tells a story, develops the characters well, and the film's major battle sequences are far from disappointing.However, that said, much of the acting looks forced and believing the children are related seems to lose its realism in spots, particularly that of the scene where Peter and Caspian get into an argument over what to do.The ending song for the last scene in the film was absolutely awful. It wasn't that the song itself was bad...it just was poorly placed into the film and really sounded bad with drastic changes in pitch and tone. A more simplistic song, such as a scored piece of music, would have served the ending way better than the director's ultimate final choice. The changes in pitch during the singing of the song was so great that it took away from being able to even understand what was transpiring between Aslan, the siblings, and the kingdom of Narnia. You almost have to block it out to hear what's happening.All in all, if you like the classic story, you likely won't be disappointed but do not expect an Oscar-worthy musical collaboration. If there's one thing that drags this film down, aside from some forced acting sequences, it would definitely be the music.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
292,toninobeman,Unoriginal,1,17 May 2008,"Unoriginal, or disappointing is easily the fastest way to describe this movie. It's possibly the most unoriginal movie i have seen in my entire life, and might I add i've seen a few. Some scenes are literally copied from Lord of the Rings, and the music from Gregson Williams is extremely familiar from KoH or the previous Narnia. Children playing the Narnian kings and queens were wooden in their performances, and were there not Ben Barnes as Caspian second Narnia would have been unwatchable. Also, the movie is too long, and rather dull and unconvincing in the first half, and i could see without even trying some grave mistakes in the directing (speeding things up, too dark screen, etc.). I give it 3/10, just because i got the tickets for free.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
293,tsk1979,Pretty Lousy,2,16 May 2008,"Boring, to say the least. After watching the first part, went with high expectations. The entire movie could have been 30 minutes long and it would have been so much longer. There is over 1:30 hours of extra boring stuff.I won't put any spoilers in here, but in the movie you have lots of blokes walking through a forest doing nothing.Its hard not to fall asleep in the first half. The second half has battles, but no originality. Bits of Tolkein, bits of roman war movies, and some really pathetic sword fighting.The lead characters do not know how to even hold a sword. It actually looks stupid. Except for Lucy, everyone has done a bad job.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
294,simple_sweetness89,Amazing!,10,24 December 2008,This movie was very amazing. i loved it. my cousin had let me borrow the DVD to watch-it was the 3-disc edition-and i stayed up all night watching it over and over. i had it for four days and watched it many many times. it was much better than i expected it to be. i have the first one and that one was amazing so i wasn't expecting anything better for the second one but i was very surprised. i found that throughout the movie i experienced different emotions-going back and forth. and at the end of the movie it left me quiet sad to find out that half of the pevensie children would not return and it left we with a question-in the book does Susan and Peter not return? i found this made me very sad and angry because for both movies i have gone on the journeys with the pevensie kids and they each contribute something to what goes on during the movies so i am waiting for the next one to see how they do it.at the end of the movie the call by Regina Spektor came on as the pevensie children left Narnia-some for the last time-and it was a very emotional moment. i feel that the song really made that moment sadder than if the song had not been there. in the movie peter was kind of a jerk as he realized prince Caspian was there. it made him make some decisions that may have not been so good for the Narnians. prince Caspian also messed some things up as well. when they raided the castle and Caspian got off task to go to Miraz's room because he killed Caspians father-i felt he was acting very selfishly.all of these things really added to the movies drama and made you want to keep watching to see how they all react to these events.the romance between prince Caspian and Susan was not really a good thing to add to the movie-it did make the movie good but i feel it was unnecessary.the last line in the movie was one of my favorite because it adds humor to the movie so we are left laughing not crying. Edmund says it and it is about going back because he left his new torch in Narnia. Aslan made very little appearance in the movie but at the end saves the day. overall the movie was amazingly good and i give props to the director and the actors and everyone else who worked on it. the cg characters were amazing and i loved the movie!,The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
295,jahnke,Child soldiers of the lion god,2,8 July 2011,"The first half of the first movie was good, had some magic, but after the first half there was only cruel violence and children that go to war.The second movie continues this violence. You will see no blood, but children that go to war and kill many men without need and without batting an eye about this cruelty. In the end their godlike Lion King saves the day.Story? There is no real story at all (unlike the book), only one war sequence after another. This movie ridiculous and pathetic. The message of this movie for your kids: Hey!

297,thebunniesiscoming,"Not bad, book is better",7,18 January 2020,"Prince Caspian isn't quite as good as the first movie in the series. In my opinion, this is because it strays too far from the book. I would have liked to see it with a younger Caspian and there are a few passages in the book that would have been really nice to see on the big screen that weren't even included. Still a decent movie, but not as good as the book.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
298,dacox-1,Excellent,9,17 January 2009,"I enjoyed The Lion The Witch & The Wardrobe, but found it lacking somehow, it came so close and was only ever OK, but not excellent. Prince Caspian was excellent. A slightly darker more adult movie than its predecessor, with excellent fx, pacing, acting, action, and score. The 2.5 hrs flew by and gave me that feeling I used to get when I'd see a great adventure on the big screen when I was a kid, like Raiders of the Lost Ark (not a comparison to the movie, just the feelings of adventure and excitement). In my opinion it was better than any of the Harry Potter's, and almost as good as LOTR installments. I'm not going to discuss the books or any hidden religious allegory because that's not this movie. This was entertainment derived from the same source material, but it's own medium, it's own beast. Enjoy, it's impossible not to.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
299,e_l_i_s_a18,"A wonderful edition, but leaves true Narnia fans disappointed.",8,17 May 2008,"Although Prince Caspian is a definite improvement to its predecessor, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, true C.S. Lewis fans will be appalled at the blatant variances from the story. However, to those who haven't read the book, or who, like myself, choose to bypass the discrepancies, Prince Caspian is a marvelous adventure filled with amazing animation, finely-crafted scenes, and believable characters. I was quite pleased with the portrayal of some of our favorite Narnian characters including Caspian, Reepicheep, Trumpkin, Trufflehunter, the centaurs, Aslan, etc. Our favorite British children have gotten older, but this is a good thing. Henley, Keynes, Moseley, and Popplewell have matured and in the process become better actors and actresses. The battle scenes were particularly thrilling, if altogether unbelievable--but who are we kidding? It's fantasy!",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
300,Bijal666,I don't believe it actually surpassed my expectations,10,30 May 2008,"I was expecting something big, something more mature and... it was exactly the way I dreamed it would be. Or even better. First of all I must write that Ben Barnes really is extremely good-looking. I never thought while watching the trailers that I would fancy him so much. He's got a lot of charisma. The rest of the cast was great too, my personal favourite was Pierfrancesco Favino as General Glozelle. The four kids from the previous movie were also very good. I loved Skandar, just the way I loved him in the first movie but this time his character is quite different. To the benefit of the story, I think. There's more action and I love action, so naturally I was very happy about that. Besides, this time the girls, especially Susan, are also involved in it, which also pleases me. What I especially like about this movie is that you can actually observe a change in Narnia. Last time we had something like Middle Ages and now we moved on to Renaissance. Weapons and armour have evolved. Well, they still haven't invented gunpowder but it's already quite impressive considering that in Middlearth nothing changed in 3000 years! I liked the music, of course. I liked the sets. I liked the locations (some stuff was shot in Poland:). I liked the battle scenes much more than in the first movie. I liked the costumes, I think they improved a lot since the first Narnia. In fact, I like everything about this movie. Even the Polish dubbing was OK (because in Poland that usually is a problem). The movie is much darker than the first one and that's what I like most about it. But it is also probably the main flaw of it. Some children were actually quite scared at times. On the other hand, the adults still treated it just as a children's story. Personally, I think it's a grave mistake. I'm of the opinion that we should forget our ridiculous stereotypes about fairy tales and fantasy and let ourselves be mesmerized by movies like ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" because it is worth it.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
301,aravindakshansunil,Perfect Sequel and Straight Out of the Books,7,20 May 2008,"I saw this movie last night, I loved it very much. Al the sequels which are produced these days from Pirates of Carribbean to Dhoom2( an Hindi movie) always reintroduces the characters. I'm not saying it's annoying but when u have watched all the movies released in the series I feel it's not important to re-introduce the old characters. It was different to watch a sequel which does-not re-introduces the characters. I'm a big fan of the Books, when i first heard they were going to make The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe I thought it's gonna be really stupid and ruin the books. When I watched The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe, i thought to myself it's not so bad, but i really din't draw myself into the The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe movie because they missed some of the major things from the book. When i heard they were going to make this movie I thought they are going to ruin it by making Aslan come all over the film to entertain kids. I was proved wrong. This is The One Book of the series where C.S.Lewis introduces Aslan in the final few chapters and still doesn't make him as a centre character. This movies is really different from the other The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe as the movie has portrayed exactly what has been said in the book, even though there have been some minor cuts but they are inevitable as the book is 300 pages long while the Movie is 90-120 mins long. If you like adventure/fantasy movie go watch this definitely worth the money.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
302,reynolds-31,"Way Better Than Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe",7,9 June 2008,"Prince Caspian excelled my expectations in many ways. I first thought of this movie as a watered down LOTR (which it is) but as the story progresses, it shows a more in depth an visually compelling sequel. The Kids, do a good job but more was needed from the cast. its very hard for teenagers to carry such a big fantasy. The new an upcoming big actor Ben Barnes done a great job as the Prince. the creatures where great really loved how they done it an had a more diverse culture of animals. The action isn't so kiddy now an i think thats why i enjoyed this movies so much. Tilda Swintons Appearance should have been longer than one scene as she was a stand out in the first as the White Witch an she would've been even better in this one.Overall i really enjoyed this movie an i think you will too. All fans of the first i would say rush to see this cause it is soo much better than LWW.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
303,gatraylor,Better and Darker Than the First,9,16 May 2008,"I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. I don't necessarily want to see violence, but the first film bothered me because of the antiseptic way that they treated the violence. They eluded to it but cut away so that it was really not shown. Such is not the case with Prince Caspian. I got much less of a feeling that this is a 'kiddie movie' as I did with the 'The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe'. There were moments that would be appealing to children and all in all, I don't think it was too violent for most kids with the exception of maybe the youngest. There were certain scenes that had me at the edge of my seat and certain scenes that were grand in scale and execution. This gives me hope for this series of movies!!!",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
304,madaseel,Underwhelming,3,7 May 2008,"Where to start? As a young kid, my favorite movies took me to worlds that I did not want to leave. The first time I saw Willow, I loved it so much that I watched it everyday for a few weeks. I just wanted to live in that sort of world, I wanted those things to be true, and mostly, I wanted to root for the underdog. Growing older, these movies sort of faded away. Was I just getting older, or did some magic disappear? Sure enough, just as I became disillusioned, movies like the Lord of the Rings trilogy and the first Chronicles of Narnia, The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe, brought me back to that same feeling I had as a child, the weird excitement in the pit of my stomach as I sat in the theater, clinging to these fictional characters for some reason or other. Which brings me to Prince Caspian.There is a fatal flaw to this film. Well, there are many flaws, but the one that stands out to me the most is this: I didn't care. Neither will you. Even though it clocks in at a robust 2 and a half hours, Prince Caspian never establishes why we should care about him, or why we should root against his uncle. They are good and evil for their own sakes. Throw in a simply awful romance subplot, ill timed humor, and poorly choreographed battle scenes, and the magic we all feel in these popcorn features slowly seeps away.I am treading lightly here, because few have seen this film. I can tell you this: Aslan and the White Witch barely contribute to this film. In fact, the White Witch has one scene, and even though it seems like it belongs on the editing room floor, I was rooting for her to become human again just to inject some life into this corpse. Aslan appears more than she, but most of his action is in the final stanza, saving the day again by calling the weird Poseidon-like figure you've seen in the commercials. Lucy has a nice discussion with him in the woods which will surely bring up the religious angle of Narnia. I have no problem with these themes, but I know some do, and this will only fuel that fire.I came into this film dying to love it. I think everyone is. People cheered after the first scene during the title card (it is an excellent opening scene). However, at the end, there was some awkward applause, but certainly nothing like the standing ovation Iron Man got one night after I saw this.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

I really need to own it before the Movie Rental store does not get this movie back!!! If you have not seen this movie yet, please see it, you will not be disappointed.The graphics were amazing, the story was intense, and without a doubt it was a great sequel to the first one. It really gave me something to be excited and happy about. Most of all, this is not just a movie, but it is a great family epic and can be enjoyed by the whole family.

306,surfin_papa_smurf,A pleasant delight of fantasy and Biblical principles.,8,16 May 2008,"For starters, the cast was excellent, and the directer captured the emotions and excitement the book provided. As a fan of The Chronicles of Narnia, as well a C.S. Lewis in general, I was weary of how the movies would turn out. Because reading a book is one thing, however watching a movie is another. As we all know C.S. Lewis was a devote Christian and he had a way of mixing fantasy, with the gospel of Christ. Throughout all his the books, he intertwined Biblical messages in them. The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe reflects the captivity of this present world under Satan, but its past and future deliverance through Jesus Christ. In the form of a lion, Aslan, Lewis brings a savior to Narnia who eventually releases the land from its winter grip and vanquishes the White Witch.From what I can tell, Prince Caspian reflects the the captivity of this present world under Satan, as well as the second coming of Christ and the acknowledgment of Christ being Lord. I was afraid the movies wouldn't capture the book's messages, I was pleased to see they did, very well. So overall, I give it a 9/10 and recommend it to everyone. It was an wonderful movie.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

The five actors Ben Barnes,Georgie Henle,Skandar Keynes,William Moseley,Anna Popplewell acted beautifully and gave 100% justice to the characters they acted.

Lewis, and entered the movie theater playing this film with high hopes. Hopes that, I'm afraid to say, were dashed. With similar carelessness to the atrocity of ""Lord Of The Rings"" (in which the nobility of Aragorn, Faramir, and others was destroyed for the advancement of the story), Adamson has taken a beloved book from my childhood and turned it into a fantastical piece of eye candy, but void of C.S. Lewis' true story. The closest they came to the book was the very beginning, as the children sit in the train station; from that point onward, everything -and I mean, everything- was changed. Nothing remained the same! I found it hard to enjoy because I know the book inside and out and was absolutely horrified that a man's life's work could be tossed aside so easily for the sake of gaining audience. The only reason I even gave it a five is because this movie (crime though it is) still bears C.S. Lewis' name. Although, next time, when filmmakers decide to stray so far from the book, perhaps they ought to just make it a new movie entirely. Congratulations Hollywood: you've destroyed Narnia.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
309,number6273,Great! But too much action and not enough emotion,7,18 May 2008,"I am an enormous fan of the series, and am pleased that the director and writers kept so many of the details from the book. They took some shortcuts/liberties, but they were necessary (the movie is already a bit long for children).My complaint: There was not enough dramatic attention drawn to some of the subplots. While this was acceptable in the book it didn't work in the movie. For example, the scene with the White Witch came out of nowhere. The power-tension between Peter and Caspian seemed incidental. The questioning of Lucy's faith was under-emphasized. Anyone who hasn't read the book wouldn't have understood the underlying conflict that motivated all of these plot points. As a result, there was little sense of tension/buildup/release. The fault for this lies squarely with the director and editor. Fortunately, the wonderful musical score saved the day by pulling emotions out of otherwise unemotional scenes.Next movie, I hope the director chooses the one or two themes that he considers most important, and develops them more fully. More drama, less fancy (and expensive) battle scenes please! We don't need to see heads being chopped off, but we do need to understand the story (my parents never read the book and both were hopelessly confused).Don't get me wrong, the movie is a masterpiece, and these are just nitpicks.

It was twice as good as the first, which says a lot in my opinion.

Although it is a lot darker than the first part, it's in comparison to LotR much more enlightened and colorful. (I have to say that I didn't really like the LotR trilogy because of that, all the fighting scenes are very dark and the blood is nearly black, so you merely see anything on a smaller screen.) That matches with the books writing style, very much like a fairy tale in a wonderful fantasy world with speaking animals etc.A lot of fans of the books where disappointed of this film because they think it doesn't really tell the story of the book.

315,Anhun,"like the title character, flawed but beautiful",8,8 January 2014,"I'm going to break down my review into components: 1. Aesthetics: This movie is absolutely gorgeous. The costumes, the setting, the special effects. Everything draws you into the fantasy setting and makes you want to stay.2. Character development/portrayals: I like how they developed Lucy and Susan. They are a bit more mature than they were in the previous film, which makes perfect sense given that the actresses have aged a bit. Lucy is, at the same time, more enchanting, and more ""real."" Caspian was too old. In the book, he experiences the same sense of childlike wonder in discovering the Old Narnia, that Lucy does in LWW. I think the movie lacks the trademark Narnian magic because there is no wonder of discovery. The Telmarine villains in this movie are brilliant. They were hateful and compelling at the same time. The character of Edmund was matured, but not enough. They should have either aged the character further, or recast the actor with someone younger. Skandar Keynes performed to the best of his ability, but he was simply too old to be convincing as a boy who thinks girls are icky. I can't stand what they did with Peter. William Moseley is a talented actor, there's no doubt about that, but the writers turned his character into an egotistical brat, and I couldn't stand him. Peter Dinklage as Trumpkin was genius. He was heroic, gruff, and endearing all at once.3: Plot/pacing: I loved the first hour and a half of the movie. They made changes from the book, but all of the changes made cinematic sense. You get to know the New Narnia, and the characters. The adventures are exciting. Unfortunately, Andrew Adamson thought that the big selling point of LWW was the battle, so he decided to cut-out some of the funny character-development moments from the book and extend the battle sequence in PC to an exhausting length. First of all, they are fighting an army that resembles Renaissance-era Spaniards, not mythic beasts, so right away it's much less novel and interesting than the battle in LWW. Second of all, the movie LWW was a well-composed adventure as a whole, for which the battle was a fitting climax, not THE selling point.4. Target audience: This movie is very teen-centric, with romance, action, and period-piece politics. It is not a family film, like LWW. I think this may be why it did not do nearly as well as LWW at the box office. The name ""Narnia"" conveys a sense of the magic of childhood. People looking for a teen action movie will likely ignore a Narnia movie without even reading a review. At the same time, with critics warning people not to bring children under 12, and word of mouth spreading that families with young children were walking out in the middle because it was too intense, families did not turn out in droves either.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
316,techsupport-autographmat,Decent version,7,10 February 2012,"This film, loosely based on the work of CS Lewis, and it is loosely based rather than a screen play of the book is actually a very good filmThe writers have taken the core idea of the original and some of the key scenes to create something which is quintessentially good fantasy. The character dynamics are good and true to the original, however they have added to, pruned and generally amended the original storyline to make a better film experience in most respects. Indeed it has been done surprisingly tastefully The effects are good as is to be expected for a high budget film, the acting is top notch, the pace is right and unlike many films from Disney they haven;t attempted to dumb it down for children, instead letting the magical fairytaleness of the story do it on its own, which makes it both stronger as a film and as an adult, far more watchable (although that's not the point).all in all its a very good film and well worth a watch.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

Lewis, I think this film was true to the spirit (especially the Christian spirit) of his books. In fact I have found the two movies in this series to be charming and well-made. Aside from this, I find them to be in some ways more vibrant and compelling than Lewis' often wooden tales. I hope many will see this movie--consider it a vote for good family entertainment. For, in these movies we seldom experience anything approaching the self-indulgence and brattiness found in the Harry Potter films, or the frantic pacing, slang dialogue, raunch and general noise of the Disney/Pixar movies. As for the story, it is a simple good-vs-bad tale. There is no lengthy quest involved--the kings and queens merely need to rally the Narnians to repel an occupying army--but the characters keep us engaged and they are convincingly played by the actors.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
318,rumyas,Lived up to its hype...,9,16 May 2008,"Warning! May contain spoilers!Finally saw it!!! I have been waiting for this for ages.. and i wasn't disappointed. I also haven't re-read the book in ages, so maybe i don't remember it that well, which may be why I liked the film so much, but hey i went there to be entertained, and i was. The plot stuck to the basic story as far as i could remember, and added a few scenes more. Maybe the Susan-Caspian plot shouldn't have been there, seeing as how we know what happens with Susan later on in the series. In fact, Susan's character was a little different from what I expected, especially after her slightly whiny ""mother wouldn't allow this"" scenes in LWW, but anyway.. she definitely compensated for not having joined the battle in the first one here. :) I hope they do bring her back in the Last Battle and not leave her where the books did. Come on, she wasn't so bad.. I liked the scenery too, even if they may have been a little ""stock travelogue"", cos they were pretty awesome on the big screen. Music might have been a little similar to the LWW, but it matched the pace of the movie well. Edmund and Lucy's characters did not have as much screen time as Peter or Susan, but definitely made their presence felt. I loved the scene where the Telmarines stopped short at the sight of Lucy at the bridge! Peter seemed a little arrogant at first, especially when he leads the Narnians in the failed attack at Miraz's castle, but it was in keeping with the character that was fighting at the beginning of the movie, and he did realize his mistake, as did Susan, especially where Aslan was concerned, so I think that made it OK at the end. And I totally loved the character of Reepicheep, and am looking forward to the next installment!For Narnia, And for Aslan!",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
319,ani_tomcruise,It's so Boring : A honest faithful Review ; Not really a spoiler,4,29 May 2008,"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe which released in a few years back (2005) was surprisingly nice , it even beat out Harry Potter & The Goblet of Fire at Oscars & at the Box Office in US . It deserved it . The First Installment of the Series, though not the first book ( The Magician's Nephew was , This is the second book ) , was off on a Great Start . The screenplay was satisfactory , Special Effects Great & of course , the story sweet . But then they decided to make Prince Caspian , which is supposedly the not-so-good book of the series , it was the fourth book ( The Horse & His Boy is the third ). It looks like the series is based on the Pevensies than on The Fabled Land of Narnia . If so they are to return one more time in The Voyage of The Dawn TreaderYes, as said in the trailer, the movie takes place in the Narnian years of 2290-2303 , a good millennium between the first & second movie , though only a year has passed for the Pevensies . In this period , the World of Narnia has turned to ruins under the harsh ruler , who bans the tales of the old Narnia ever being told . Aslan hasn't been seen for sometime & hope looks bleak . Enter the Pevensies .The 4 actors have improved slightly , though is not a relief . The movie lacks a gripping screenplay , buts scores well again in the visual effects department . Could have been loads better had the director , Andrew Adamson , kept in mind that this is a fantasy adventure which not many have read , unlike Harry Potter which usually comes under the scrutiny of fans for not being faithful enough , he should have realized that & penned a tighter & more gritter story . Alas ! he defies that logic & then fails to even be faithful to the novel . ( Pevensies land near a forest not a beach , director ! )Sergio Castellitto who plays King Miraz is good but the casting could have been better , I'm not saying cast only stars , but about being more precise . Lot of new or unknown faces isn't going to attract crowd , no wonder it didn't have an opening it expected . Robert not-so-famous Downey Jr. was excellent as Iron Man , but the movie raked in millions with precisely casted stars like Gywneth Paltrow , Jeff ""The Dude"" Bridges & Terrence Howard ; & also on special effects , good screenplay & direction making it among the best comic book adaptations along with Batman Begins , Hellboy , Sin City , Spiderman 2 & 300This is Excerpt of Comic Relief from the movie :1.Edmund Pevensie: If they're smart, the Telemarines will wait and starve us out. Squirrel: We can collect nuts! Reepicheep:( sarcastically ) Yes! And throw them at the Telemarines. (turns to Squirrel) Reepicheep: *Shut* up.2.Prince Caspian: Minotaurs? They're real? Nikabrik: Not to mention big, huge. 3.King Miraz: Well then, Prince Edmund... Edmund Pevensie: It's King, actually. King Miraz: I beg your Pardon. Edmund Pevensie: It's KingEdmund. Just King though. Peter's the High King. (awkward pause) Edmund Pevensie: I know, it's confusing. Funny ? I think not. Though the movie has some memorable moments, it does not come under the fabled classic fantasy section will is Ruled by Pan's Labyrinth , The Lord of the Rings Trilogy & some of the Harry Potter Movies like the 1st , 3rd & 5thPrince Caspian was dull , boring & was excellent only in special effects .

More specifically about the plot: Nothing made me want to root for Caspian- he's an idiot. Movies of this genre should make you care about the protagonists. The director spent far too much time lingering on meaningless hall shots with characters staring at carvings on the wall. The sound mixing was horrible, I couldn't hear the dialog half the time, and the music added nothing to the scenes while frequently drowning out the dialog.

324,cedarcross,Deftly addresses major human challenges,8,27 May 2008,"""Prince Caspian"" is a very well done translation of the book to the movie. To expect an exact adaptation is not realistic. It is a fundamentally different medium and that must change the message.What was the central challenge that the major characters faced? The myth of redemptive violence - that we can and should kill off our enemies. Peter and the Prince are most seduced by this myth, but Susan and most of the Narnia animals are also. Lucy captures the truth that a child shall lead them. The hinge question asked why Asylan did not prove his presence to the older ones is profoundly answered by Lucy - maybe we need to prove ourselves to him. The real challenge is to pay attention, and seek one's source for the power of good.The others gradually move through a reliance on violence. Peter issues a challenge for a 1-on-1 fight rather than having armies killed. The Prince chooses twice not to kill his enemy. Edmond stops a movement toward relying on a different type of spirit to gain one's own goals. But the key was to courageously align oneself with the power to transform. The image of Lucy standing on the bridge brings back the picture of Rosa Parks sitting on the bus.Yes I wish the battle scenes could have been somewhat shorter and more time devoted to character development. Yes it was beautifully filmed with great effects. And yes, seeing this on the big screen was worth the exorbitant prices being charged these days.Perhaps my grandson's answer to the central challenge is best: ""Should the Prince kill or not kill."" So again, a young person leads.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
325,pauljustinlean,Great Journey,8,19 May 2008,"The trailer is not good, I have to admit it. I almost had the feeling of not watching the movie. But somehow my good feeling about the first movie told me to give it a shot. I did, and I am so glad that I did. I've read the book since I was a child, and I've always wonder how will they turn it into a movie. The book itself is not the best one among the series, in fact it felt a little plain compare to the previous one. So it is good to see they put in some extra elements to make it look more realistic and interesting. The four Pevensie siblings are all grown up. And their acting abilities are getting better and better, particularly Georgie Henley. She is no more the little girl with some weird expressions in the first movie. As for their characters, Peter (as the eldest) has always been the center of every heroic scene, in both films. This time around, it is great to see the tension and competition between him and Prince Caspian. This is one of the things they add in (I think), because I don't remember the book put it that way. But it felt natural and logical to have those teens compete with each other. Hey, isn't that what we do in high school? I also like what seems like the feeling of guilt shown on Peter's face after hearing of what happened in Narnia after they left thousand years ago. They are just human, and they should have felt so seeing all the ruins in Narnia. Susan has always been portrayed as one beautiful girl in the books. As I do not see how Anna Popplewell fit to it in the first movie, she is perfectly the ""pretty girl"" this time around. She is more graceful and ladylike, but still manages to look heroic when doing the battle scene. The attraction between her and Prince Caspian is another of the extra elements I think appropriate and logical. They are teens, of course they will be attracted to each other. Just because they are in Narnia doesn't mean they are not human or possess any feeling anymore. And the one scene where she tells Lucy how she ""finally get used to the idea of being in England"" is probably a hint of her not returning to Narnia anymore (she is not even returning in the last book, because she has long forgotten it). Edmund gets the least storyline this time. It's a pity, I really like his character very much. But luckily he gets a lot of good lines this time. The face on Miraz's and his people's faces when he interrupted them by declaring himself as ""King"" is just so funny. In fact, I think this is the funniest scene in the movie. And he being the one to stab the White Witch thus preventing her from coming back is so well designed, particularly when he was once her biggest fans. Lucy, being the first to enter Narnia, has always been the center of the story. Her characters are not that well developed this time, but the plot of her faith in Aslan is still the center of the story. But it's fine, she still gets to come back in the next one (if there is a next one???). All the other characters are great, not to mention the special effects and the breathlessly beautiful cinematography. As an epic, this movie is one of the best (although sometimes you might mistakenly thinking you are watching The Lord Of The Rings). While as a drama, I do think they show a lot more emotions and feelings this time compare to the first movie. When the song ""The Call"" started to play at the end, I feel kinda sad watching the siblings turn and walking out of Narnia. To me, they really do have a wonderful journey to Narnia this time.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
326,mattster5,"If you liked the book, you'll hate the movie",1,17 May 2008,"I'm obligated to say that this review contains ""spoilers,"" but I use this term reservedly since I'm not sure this movie can really be spoiled. At least, I'm not sure how you would be able to tell.Einstein's famous equation E=mc^2, part of his theory of relativity, explains how it is physically impossible for the opening chapters of Lewis' ""Prince Caspian"" to be rushed through any more quickly than was done by Adamson's abomination of the same name. It literally made me dizzy. I'll just lay it out there and get it over with; Adamson follows the storyline of the book very well. In the book, the Pevensies come to Narnia, help Caspian gain his rightful throne, and then go home; Andrewson has all three of these things happen in the movie. That's about where the similarities end. In a pathetically feeble attempt to keep fans of the book happy, Andrewson plugs in a few scenes or references from the book that don't interfere with his plot. At first, it's kind of interesting to see what kind of events he makes up to tie in the other events he made up with the events from the book. We miss this later in the movie, though, as he pretty much abandons the events from the book until the end. All this happens because he really wants the Pevensies to meet up with Caspian earlier; I have absolutely no idea why this was so important to him. It doesn't really add anything and it wreaks havoc with the storyline. In his determination to be as faithful as possible to the spirit of the book, Adamson hacks out all the events in Narnia that lead up to the blowing of the horn and almost all of the Pevensie's journey to Aslan's How. Shockingly, cutting out the first half of Lewis' story and replacing it with his own leaves the scenes taken from Lewis' story, both those later in the movie and the few scenes randomly inserted in the beginning, seeming somewhat incongruous and forced. You can almost tell what scenes or dialogue are from the book even if you haven't read it, simply by noticing the discontinuity. Whenever, a character seems to be acting out of a character or a scene seems to have little to do with the plot, it's probably from the book.I can't imagine what could make this Andrewson character (his real name is Andrew Adamson, by the way) think he has the artistic credentials to make such a massive revision to such a great work. It's not like he's on the short list for a lifetime achievement award here. Does he honestly think he can improve on Lewis? Does he realize that the whole reason this movie is being made is because so many people love Lewis' story? Does he think Lewis' plot isn't good enough? It's not like Lewis' story lacked dramatic tension or action or character development. Andrewson didn't supply what was lacking, he just changed for no apparent reason, exhibiting monumental arrogance in the process. I'm going to harp some more on this because it really baffles me, what was gained by all these revisions? Did Andrewson just decide to use Lewis' story as a platform for his own ideas because he has no respect for a great author, or did he actually have the arrogance to think he could somehow improve on or tell Lewis' story better than Lewis could? I wish I could know what was going through his mind ""hey, I just read this book by a guy named Siyes Lewis, or something like that. Alright, I really just skimmed it. The point is, it gave me some great ideas for a movie"" ""Look, Lewis spends way too much time with the Pevensies once they get to Narnia. This movie is not about the Pevensies. I'll have them immediately find Cair Paravel, immediately recognize it as Cair Paravel, immediately rescue the dwarf (whatever-his-name-is) and leave Cair Paravel, and almost immediately get to Aslan's How. That way I can spend more time with the central characters, the Telmarines, who Lewis barely even thinks to mention during this time. Plus, I really need to develop the Telmarines for the viewers since I cut out the whole beginning of the book where Lewis did that."" If Andrewson feels no ethical constraint to respect the integrity of another artist's work, you would think he would at least be bright enough to realize that the easiest way to make a brilliant movie is to stick as closely as possible to the brilliant book. That's what Peter Jackson did with Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, and it worked out okay for him.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

328,stevenbarrow4,Very Good. Better then the first.,8,17 May 2008,"The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian is a very fun and exciting movie. Unlike the first, which gave a more mystical feel, Narnia 2 is more violent. Also unlike the first which had a story lead to a fight, in this there are fights through out the story. When you reach the fight scenes they are more elaborate, much bigger, more polished and there are much more fights in general then there were in the first. One thing that I thought added much more fun to the fights was the Pevensie children know how to use their weapons, they are very active in the fights and there skills help make them look great. But what some people my over look and call boring, was the story that is told in Narnia 2. I felt the story was easy to understand and very interesting, and by knowing what transpires between the characters through the film it helps make the fight scenes that much more dramatic. I love to see the Pevensie kids back. Prince Caspian is a very good addition to the cast as are some other new & funny characters.In terms of presentation, I really can't think of something that the first movie had and this didn't. I really believe that this movie is a full step ahead then the first in every way. With this movie being very well done and being very fun to watch, I feel the franchise that comes out of it will be amazing to see.

329,steven-a-bailey,An Incredible Film That Makes For An Exciting Time,9,27 May 2008,"""The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe"" was a really good movie. This film, surprisingly, outdoes it. Having read the book, I wasn't sure if I'd be ready for the changes from the book, but as long as the changes added to the story, I'd be fine.The Pevensies return to Narnia, only to find that it is many hundreds of years after they left it, and the grand conflict taking place now is the evil Telmarine warrior Miraz has seized the throne, and Prince Caspian has joined the old Narnian creatures in a battle to reclaim that throne. Throughout the film, the characters wonder where Aslan is, and learn that when they try to do things their own way, things just go bad.The acting is really good here. The action scenes are more intense this time around, and the film might be too much for those under the age of 9. The story is well-paced and, in my opinion, more emotional than the first. Many people are complaining that the Christian messages were watered down in this installment, but I thought they were more prominent this time around, and were very well done. Scenes where Lucy apologizes for not following Aslan (who represents Jesus) when nobody else wanted to, etc., just add to the emotion.The changes weren't nagging at all, and I felt added depth and strength to the story. The big one - the kiss at the end - I feel might have something to do with how Susan eventually ends up in the series, so I don't think that was a useless addition.A darker film that tends to push the PG-rating to its utmost limits, but it is still very well done.

My husband and I were both disappointed. 1. What happened to the story? Yes, many books are slow and may seem boring when translated to film, but this lacks so many of the necessary details of the original story. There are those of us who love romance, but it DOES NOT belong in this story. Yes, battle scenes are enticing to movie-goers, but when was there an attack on Miraz's castle? Dr. Cornelius does not get captured. 2. What's with the Telmarine accent? There could have been something subtle to show that the Telmarines were foreigners to Narnia, but this was ridiculous! 3. Huh? What did they say? Is it possible to speak up a bit and enunciate? I missed so much dialogue; this DID NOT happen in the first movie. 4. Yes, Edmund is more mature and honorable in this story, but Peter did not seem quite so arrogant and vicious. 5. For those who mention the White Witch, no she doesn't have much of a part and well, if person had read the book, he/she would know why. Aslan makes a point of stating why he doesn't appear as much.

I had a great time--more than I did with the previous Narnia film, and I definitely plan to see it again. The fight scenes, cinematography, humor, lighting, effects, soundtrack, etc. were so much better than what I expected. It was perfect, Reepicheep is adorable, Susan has some serious girl power, and, most importantly, Caspian is hot (Peter too :), not to mention Edmund's beautiful Edward Rochester eyes. But (there always is a downside) the storyline....well, for someone who is pretty familiar with the book, it was worse than what I wanted. If I had not read the book, I would have liked it a lot more. But there are more deviations than I am comfortable with, and while TL, TW, aTW stuck much closer to the original story, this movie took more than a few liberties. When I see it again, I think I'll like it better. However, this was enough to drop this movie to a 9. What took it to the 8 was the Caspian/Susan kiss. I was hoping it wouldn't be there at all; but my worst fear was that it would be this deep, disgusting kiss, which, thankfully, is definitely not. So overall, I would definitely recommend this film--all the technical aspects of this film are excellent, the acting is fairly good (at least the adults and the younger kids are) and is a far better movie than the previous Prince Caspian.

At least it would be fair. Tell me, did you try to count just how many times in this movie a ""good"" guy tells a joke half a second before slicing ""bad"" guy's throat? That's supposed to be funny, eh? ""Yes, I'm a mouse. You're so not original."" - *slash* - to the next one. So cynical it was, it stunned me. What, just like that? Hundreds of ""bad"" guys get ripped apart - just because they happened to be in the army of a bad-tempered king - and we laugh at how timely our good guys joke about their deaths? And why did narnians deserve to win? What changed, what moved, what spiritual victory or triumph was achieved? The Four Plus One came, they started a war - funny, too, for it was simply motivated by a revenge of one human against the other one, of the same blood and culture, and narnians didn't even think much about that. Of course - Mr. Hollywood told it's a ""good guy"", so we better all believe in that... like if it was just a caprice of one ""bad"" guy that nearly destroyed Narnia before, and not human nature itself... so, yes, what about the victory? Was there a sacrifice, a gift of love or life given? No, we just ride to ask the local God for help, that's all. Just freaking go, hug him, and ask - can you please kill for us? We were doing fine, but there's just a bit too many... - Oh sure I can, little one. Just waited for you to come and ask. WHACK! WHACK! ROAR!And so it goes. No plot, no love, no sacrifice, no heart. Not even a bit of tragedy - cute ones get resurrected... by what virtue? Who cares, ""good"" conquers all, even if it's purely mechanical. Oh, and Killer Mouse just ripped off the Puss In Boots @ Shrek 2.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
335,hdickins,More convincing than the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe.,7,3 June 2008,"I saw a (very early) screening of this in Cardiff. And I was very impressed. Having been slightly disappointed by the first film, Prince Caspian was grittier and far more convincing. The young cast are more 3-dimensional, both individually and with the dynamics between them. The non-human characters were excellent too, especially Trumpkin & Reepicheep (although I still find Neesom's voice 'wrong' for Aslan)The story is perhaps a little rushed - with little time spent on the background to the story; but exploring those aspects would have made the film unwieldy, so I think they made the right choices. Also, the film does stay reasonably true to the book. (Not entirely, but close enough - there are certainly very few big omissions or alterations to the story, so you won't feel 'betrayed' if you're a fan on the book.)The story is also, naturally, less obviously Christian in it's content - while still having a 'faith' element to it. Again, I'd say this is pitched very well - Lucy's steadfast but childlike trust in Aslan is particularly well portrayed.Of course, the film does feel like a sequel, but not in a bad way; it just helps to have seen the first film. Similarly, it does 'help' to be familiar with the book too.See it!",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
336,deamsdawg,They keep getting better,9,16 May 2008,"I caught this as a screener and am so happy I did. Whether or not you read the books you'll probably like this if you're into this genre. It's got a bit of something for most everyone; even a little romance.I found the CGI better than the first. The writers captured the significant parts of the storyline and included some comic relief. There were definitely moments of achieved catharsis with the audience. The actors and actresses seemed to be much more at ease in their roles than the first one and exuded the characteristics of each of the roles well. I wouldn't recommend little kiddos seeing this because of the violence (no blood just some obvious fighting) however I don't understand why most parents take their kids to a movie I (an adult) would watch. When I was a kid a Minotaur would have given me nightmares for weeks. Those around me liked it even more than I did. There were maybe a couple of points where they didn't clearly portray the tone of the group or a characters attitude; but that's young acting maybe. All in all, really well done.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
337,joshuaevans89,A movie that shall last forever!!!,10,18 May 2008,"A definite BEST, better than the prequel. I recommend this to all ages! The action and theatrical effects are excellent. The score played in Prince Caspian is wonderful. When released on video it WILL be apart of my personal collection. Caspian is now in theaters, and I urge you all to take your ENTIRE family, and enjoy!!! I have no negatives/complaints about this film, except that if they don't make the sequel, it will be quite a disappointment. It also has Christian value, yet it is quite fantastical and is full of magic. Which proves it's worth, and should be seen by all. The ending could not have been any better than it was, and will touch the hearts of millions, and all who have seen it! I can't even begin to imagine it's ratings, when they start to pour in! #1 in my opinion!",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
338,randykbh,"Not as good as the first one, but still excellent",9,1 June 2008,"In some ways, Prince Caspian was better than The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (LWW). First off, it was hilarious. More than LWW. There was so much laughter in the theater, I didn't hear all the punchlines when seeing it opening night.The acting was better. Especially Edmund. He wasn't the selfish brat he was is LWW. Peter was more of a leader in this one. Not afraid to get into it with Prince Caspian. He was even blaming Prince Caspian for a botched attack. Susan also matured. She got to give Prince Caspian a kiss. And Lucy matured more than her other siblings. And yet, as in LWW, she was so adorable.There was a lot more action in this film. So much action, Susan never ran out of arrows. In the scene where her and Lucy ride on horseback into the forest, I counted 5 arrows in Susan's quiver and one in her bow. That's six. She fired at least three arrows. When she returned from deep within the forest, I counted five arrows in her quiver. She should have been running out of arrows at the rate she was shooting. If not, run out of arrows.However, overall, Prince Caspian was not as good as LWW. First off, Who's the star? The movie posters and the opening credits of the film show that Georgie Henley's (Lucy's) name first. And yet, she really didn't stand out that much in the film. In fact, I was wondering where she was part of the time.There were too many dark scenes. LWW had more brighter scenes, which I enjoyed more.Prince Caspian's hand get cut. The next scene he's in, his hand is wrapped up. Why didn't Lucy use her bottle of healing cordial on it to heal it? Aslan was too reserved. He didn't say very much.Prince Caspian didn't seem to have as many Christian themes in it, like LWW had. I expected to see more than what I saw.When the Pevensie children were getting ready to return to their own world, they weren't wearing their school uniforms. Their uniforms appeared on them after walking through the portal to their own world. If their uniforms suddenly appeared, how come Edmund's flashlight didn't reappear in his bag? I give Prince Caspian a nine. It wasn't as good as LWW. LWW touched my heart more. It's just not the same without the Beaver's and Mr. Tumnus. However, Prince Caspian is the best movie I've seen this year. And I just saw the new Indiana Jones movie, which I was disappointed with. I saw Prince Caspian at the theater twice, and I'll be looking forward to seeing it a third time, before buying it on DVD.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
339,doggieberry,Better than expected,9,12 June 2008,"Ben Barnes (Prince Caspian) is really a surprise. I didn't expect it that he is sooooo dashing. People usually can't help comparing -- I am no exception. I'd say this one is much better than The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe (2005). It's pity that we've got no English version in here. I am not saying that the dub sucks, but we prefer the original one. And the background music sounds out of tune, I wonder whether the copied film has been stored properly? It sounds like it is wet. But that's not the flaw the movie has itself. The story begins with the birth of a new baby, son of Miraz, an evil, ambitious, aggressive, dark man who wants to claim the throne and makes his only son heir. He has to remove Prince Caspian on the way to the crown. His men chased Caspian down to Narnia. All of a sudden, Caspian blew the horn (something belongs to Lucy). Then the scene is switched to the 20th century. The four Pevensie children was brought back to Narnia due to the horn, I assume. Upon their arrival, they find that the forest is no longer known to them. Later they come to know that 1,300 years have slipped since they left, and Narnia has been nearly wiped out by the Telmarines. Now the four have something new to fix -- to help people in Narnia reclaim their land and rights and Prince Caspian his throne. War is unavoidable. ...This move is a good pastime. Handsome, young prince, plus cute, incredible, able-to-speak-like-man animals, especially a valiant little mouse (with a red feather fixed in his head) called Reepicheep. All these seems to be some elements of childish fairy tale. But it turns out to be a rather dark, adult motion picture, which I don't think it might suit kids. But maybe this style is what exactly the director wants and it proves successful. No doubt, Prince Caspian has a more intriguing plot. And I think the characters are filled with more meaning this time. Every one is grown up. Though Lucy is still a little chick, she is much more mature internally. And this role always stands for something pure and fresh in human's heart, something we might have lost for a long time -- innocence-- and only this can bring on magic and power. Maybe this is a sunbeam penetrating the darkness of the forest.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
340,cricketnut2008,A huge disappointment,3,8 June 2008,"I loved the first film and have watched it over and over with my daughter on DVD since we first saw it in the cinema. However, the Prince Caspian screenplay diverged so much from the book they might as well have given this film a different name.The sickly, contrived love interest between Caspian (a small boy in the book) and Susan was completely incongruous - especially as Ben Barnes (Caspian) is more wooden than a non-talking Narnian tree, however pretty he might be to look at. He wasn't the only poor actor, mind you. The four Pevensie children looked as though they shared my opinion of the script and couldn't get through it fast enough, while the villains were cardboard cutouts. Peter's mumbling in particular was shocking - you could hardly make out a complete sentence of his. The directors were completely high-handed with the plot and played fast and loose with Lewis's character development as well. The only acceptable aspect of the whole thing was the special effects and fight scenes, which were stunning.I hope they make a better fist of the Dawn Treader, or I will be summoning Aslan to roar their hides off!",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
341,DanielAarden,Enjoyable!,7,4 August 2008,"I enjoyed C.S. Lewis' ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" saga.Director Andrew Adamson has made Lewis' story even more entertaining by throwing in a lot more action. The screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely works well.Instead of following the same formula of the first film, Adamson has created a Narnia that is darker.Caspian (Ben Barnes, Peter (William Moseley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Keynes) and Lucy (Georgie Henley) all do nicely.I can easily see why people would find it enjoyable. If Adamson can keep this trend up of outdoing himself with each film, then I hope it won't be too long before we get another chance to experience the world of Narnia.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
342,lovermuffinpookerhead,For Young and Old Alike,9,23 August 2008,"This was a wonderful sequel to the original story. It shows the kids as in their own dull and bleak lives, and thankfully yanks them into a new (yet quasi-familiar) realm of Narnia. The story line is wonderful, the cast is wonderful and it is all beautifully done. This movie will please both the young and old and is a great family movie. This is a great movie filled with strength, passion, truth, honor and courage as we watch the kids battle the wicked and unjust... without the assistance of Aslan. Watch as the kids (and those ""with"" them) face overwhelming odds to be victorious in the land of Narnia. And of course, there is always room left at the end for yet another sequel....",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
343,jakobhummelen,It's the perfect movie for the new young generation,9,3 November 2008,"Even though CoN: Prince Caspian doesn't surprise as much as the first movie, it's still a GREAT movie for the new young generation. We all have movies that we have an emotional attachment, movies that taught us about things such as moral, imagination and other such important lessons. Prince Caspian manages to teach the viewer a lesson of the likes of that in a modern way. Not only doesn't the movie shy away from confrontation and violence it also portrays that actions have consequence and that independence is important.Some drawbacks to this movie include that some parents may keep their children from watching this since it has some violence in it and the fact that you have to have watched the first Narnia movie to understand Prince Caspian is not ideal.All and all I'd say this movie is well worth your time if you are looking for a fun and exciting adventure with a hint of comedy. Enjoy!",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
344,rjj-11,Entertaining,7,21 January 2009,"I liked it better than the first. The directing, producing, and acting were better, though unfortunately not the editing.I thought it did more to both flesh out the characters and to actually bring a bit of the Christian allegory through, both very positive things. Lucy was so adorable, both smiling and sad. Peter was a bit dark for my taste, seemed a bit of a switch for me since Edmund seemed to be the dark one in the first one, I was a bit confused about that, though I'm sure there are deeper aspects from the book that I don't recall since it has been quite the long time since I read the series.I like that the movie Prince Caspian had action in it, though I was surprised at the amount of killing in a movie that I *thought* was supposed to be for kids as well.Good movie :)",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

Although they had been in Narnia before their adventures are quite different. My favorite actor was Prince Caspian. I think Prince Caspian did a wonderful job acting in this movie. The most interesting part in the movie is when they got into the battle. The battle was interesting to me, because they fought with all different types of weapons .I also think that the part when the children attack the castle at night; it made the movie better than what it was. I think that part should have been in the book to make the book more interesting. Overall I enjoyed this movie, because it was really interesting. It also had a few sad parts in it, but after all it turned out to be a great movie.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
346,jadejedi,"Not bad, but not great either",6,13 April 2010,"Personally, this film was great, if you haven't read the book. Although Andrew Adamson tried to follow the book as much as possible, but the movie and book didn't match up. Cinematography was great, and all the actors and actresses perfectly executed their lines with emotion, but I just couldn't feel like I was there.Also, what's up with Caspian and Susan? That was never explained in the book. It was alright to put it in the final copy of the movie, but honestly, they could've done better if they had cut it out to add more features from the ORIGINAL book. Seriouly, it was just disappointing.But on the good side, I loved the action sequences! The one thing I liked that Adamson added was the small battle scene at Miraz's castle. Even though it wasn't in the book, I felt it helped connect the plot line with Peter and Caspian. It shows how frustrated Peter really was and how Caspian now feels trying to take on responsibility and the guilt of his father's death (which Miraz did).The actors and actresses were very good overall. Peter Dinklage with his amazing eye work, Skandar Keynes and William Moseley as teenage boys, and sweet Georgie Henley as Lucy. I know this is kind of late to say, but she's really cute as Lucy.Even though you'll probably enjoy the movie for the first, second, and third time, after that you might want to prepare for being bored throughout the film. It's not a movie you want to watch over and over again.Overall, this was an enjoyable film, mostly for everyone. I liked it, and if I was a professional and legally able to critique this project, I'd give it a 2 1/2 out of 4 stars.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
347,bpetruzzo,"Well done, and much better than the first",8,16 May 2008,"I just got home from seeing the first possible showing of The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian. Well of course, what else could one expect? I'm a Christian and I guess I do things like that. That's exactly what Disney and Walden Media are banking on. Literally.I will say up front that Narnia is an obvious, shameless attempt to capitalize on the growing population of Americans who proactively call themselves Christians. I'm certain that many fans of the original C.S. Lewis works will have grievances with the film adaptation of this installment in the series, but there's something important to note here. Between C.S. Lewis and Disney/Walden Media, there is a very important difference. C.S. Lewis was a writer to the glory of God, with the end hope that those who didn't know Jesus would, and those who did know Jesus would fall more deeply in love with him. His articulate and inspiring allegories and non-fiction works have done this for a vast number of people. Walden Media and Disney, on the other hand, have one thing in mind. Money. They are businesses and it's what they do, it's what they exist for and it would be silly for us to expect otherwise.However more shallow the purpose in producing this series may be, it does not change that an excellent job was done.For those who are unfamiliar with this installment of the Narnia series, Peter, Edmund, Lucy and Susan have been back in the real world for a year since they're first trip to Narnia when suddenly they are whisked back. In Narnia times, somewhere around 1000 years have passed and the whimsical creatures of the ancient land have been forced into hiding by a line of corrupt kings of the ""son's of Adam"". When the gang arrives on the scene, they discover things to be quite different than they remember and a lot rougher (also a quality of the film, clearly contrasting the last installment). Alongside Prince Caspian, the rightful heir to the throne, the crew must lead the Narnians in a fight against the army's of men.When compared to the story's close relative The Lord of the Rings, Narnia is child's play. In the whole film there is next to no graphic violence at all. In fact, the only blood shown is when one character cuts his hand. But let's remember, this is a family film. And even being such, the lack of graphic violence didn't take away from the intensity of the action or the story. Unlike the first film, which ultimately felt a bit anticlimactic, this installment pushed the audience's limits at pretty much every turn. The fight sequences were intense enough to be believed and the characters deep enough to be cared about. The combination made for an extremely enjoyable viewing experience.The movie's pacing should also be noted. While nearly everything in the first installment of Narnia felt rushed and crowded, the second installment clearly resolved this problem for the most part. Although the opening sequence involving the children did feel a bit hasty, the rest of the story unfolded with grace and clarity. A friend appropriately described it saying that they fully committed to nearly every sequence. No fight was rushed, no argument skimmed over, no dialogue irrationally assumed. They took their time on every opportunity and it paid off well.The visual effects in this installment were stellar. One particular sequence involving a water creature stands out as possibly being the best visual effects I have ever seen to date. The music score was also excellent. It never distracted from the movie; in fact, I rarely explicitly noticed it at all.While it seems that much of the movie stayed true to the book, there are a number of events in the movie which I know for sure were added; likely for commercial appeal. Those who have read the book will probably grumble at them because the additions added little and often threatened what was already there; one quite notably so. I agree that the additions were frivolous and ultimately useless, but let's remember, Disney and Walden aren't trying to make disciples here, they're trying to make money. Once again, this installment also closed with an extremely poor choice in soundtrack. However, the error is easily forgiven, and who can blame them for wanting to sell a few extra copies of the soundtrack album?",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
348,mosani-judith,Can't get enough Narnia!,9,22 March 2012,"Having read the books and watched the old BBC TV show as well as ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" from 2005, I would never have expected such a rapidly fast film full of action and power.The Pevensie-actors have developed very much, especially Skandar Keynes, whom you almost wouldn't recognize again. His rebellious little boy-Edmund from LWW has grown into a passionate young man eager to live up to the expectations Narnian people place in their former kings and queens. But also Ben Barnes as Caspian X. fits in without problems. This film is overall much darker and more dramatic than LWW. There is suspension and dramatic action all the time, and even the film score acts its part, being omnipresent and driving the plot forward. You almost never get a moment of rest and contemplation because the opposing forces never cease or even pause in pursuing their goals: Caspian and the Pevensies to free the Narnian people and raise Caspian to his inherited throne, Miraz and his Telmarine troops to secure their usurped reign over the country.

I thought The lion the witch and the wardrobe was bad but this is even worse. Firstly the story in the film is so different to that of the book that it's barley worth watching. Then there are the battles. Why this is needed i don't know. One, yes. Two, yes but not continually. In the latter half the film became more and more like Lord of the rings. Gladiator is a classic example of battles in films done right. The characters were all terrible and nothing like portrayed in the books. The acting was even worse apart from the cameos from the minor animals. The whole feel you should get from being in Narnia just isn't there. The direction was dire as was the failed attempts at humour. The only good thing in the film was the music. Even then they only used one song apart from some strange ballad at the end.Overall another disappointment.

353,Chronicles_Of_Narnia,Prince Caspian is more than a worthy sequel to the first Narnia film!,10,9 May 2008,"I was able to catch a test screening for Disney's highly anticipated Chronicles of Narnia sequel.The theater was PACKED, (At least 350 people from the greater Chicago area) but all the flier said was that the screening was for a Disney summer movie, nothing more. When the crowd was notified that the film being screened was for Prince Caspian, there was a loud cheer. Mark Johnson, the producer of the film was in attendance taking notes on the audience's reaction.The audience cheered pretty loudly at the end of the film, and Mark Johnson, producer of the film asked what people liked and disliked. People said they liked the fact that this film had a lot more action, had better pacing, and better visual effects. All in all, I would say I really enjoyed this film, a lot more than the first one. I liked the visual creatures a lot more, the action, and I really enjoyed the storyline. Despite a questionable release date, I would say that this film, will really please fans of the first film, and those who enjoy fantasy films in general.

354,jeanieb-1,I was surprised,9,16 May 2008,"Having just come back from a screening of Prince Caspian, I can honestly say that I got the movie fresh in my mind...and it was amazing! Not only was it better than the first in every way - the story, the acting, the screenplay - but it managed to have more of an edge without sinking into the pitfall that movies such as Pirates of the Caribbean have slipped into.Meaning that unlike the Pirates sequels (don't get me wrong, I love Pirates, but this is something that bothered me a little), the makers of Prince Caspian did not believe that to make it better and more exciting, they had to gore and bloody it up. Instead, while it is darker, the blood and gore is kept to a bare minimum considering this is an action flick.Anyway, that now aside, I highly recommend this! It's a great movie - great action scenes, a tad bit of romance but not overly so, and a good plot. Plus the young cast are even better in this film than they were in the first, and Ben Barnes - well, it's right that he is the title character,because he very nearly would have stolen the floor from underneath the original kids if they were even the slightest bit less perfect (William Moseley was the weakest of the five, as he was in the last movie, but he still stepped it up quite a bit).Granted, I've not read the books, so I don't know if this is as dedicated to the book as many fans would like it to be. Then again, most movies adapted from the books never are. However, if they can find it in them to accept changes for theatrical purposes, I'm sure even the most die-hard fans will admit it ""wasn't bad.""",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

Reepicheep the mouse is awesome, as is Trufflehunter the badger and Trumpkin the dwarf. By the way, I am extremely glad they used real dwarf men instead of children dressed in beards like in the first one.

357,M_Robber,Shameless Christian Propaganda,7,19 May 2008,"But really well made shameless Christian propaganda. I must admit, despite the nonsensical religious theme in the film, I quite enjoyed it.Just to clarify, by religious theme I mean the need to find Aslan (who obviously represents Jesus, or perhaps God) before victory is remotely conceivable. He is a stupid Deus Ex Machina who, as soon as you have the courage to find him and accept him, will save the day and clear up any mess. Pretty reminiscent of Christian preaching, no? Not to mention when Aslan (Jesus) roars at the bridge, a big (albeit watery) long-haired bearded dude (Jesus's Dad, aka God) comes and crushes the enemy.I think the line that annoyed me the most was Lucy's ""or have you forgotten who really defeated the White Witch, Peter?"" Damn I hate when people attribute human accomplishments to deities.Another thing I noticed was the apparent ethnicity of the Talmarines. Was I the only one who found their pointy-bearded facemasks and generally darker complexion slightly ""saracen""? I realise I may be reading too much into it, but still, you can't deny there was a certain eastern aesthetic to their headgear.Anyway, despite all this I must admit it was an enjoyable film - it was sufficiently dark to give it a certain maturity (although the naive religious theme detracts from that) and the supporting characters were interesting. It was well paced, and the action was intense and exciting, managing the epic and personal scope with surprising dexterity.It's a shame The Golden Compass wasn't made by such capable people. In these times, a bit of proper atheist propaganda wouldn't have gone amiss at all.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
358,Later-Procrastinator,um an okay movie...,5,21 May 2008,"well, for one thing it was MUCH MUCH funnier than the first one, i was laughing through-out!!!the whole movie. okay, why i didn't like the movie: 1. whats up with peter, i forget the book, but did he turn into such an a**hole?2. except that bit where he shatters the white witch, where the hell was Edmund,i.e why did he seem so inconsequential in the whole movie???? and how come he became so docile? did peter and ed exchange personalities?!?!!?3.many plot holes that made no sense,some of which are: -if Lucy saw Aslan on the other side of the cliff, and their aim was to cross the river,later they get on to the same side of the cliff and then proceed to cross the river...um huh? -if the trees were awoken, then how come all the vegetation showed later did not fight!4.Was Lucy that annoying? i liked her in the books, here i'm wary of her coming on scene, because she seems to cry and whimper most of the time!5.okay the whole Caspian-Susan love equation just didn't work for me, i cringed whenever they showed them on-screen, there was no chemistry and it was just SO funny!!! i couldn't help but laugh...LOUDLY!Now Why I Liked It: -EYECANDY!!!! and pretty decent acting eye candy at that!! i finally decided on Caspian after he becomes king-seemed hotter then, till then i was still drooling all over Pete, regardless of the HUGE ego...he he-The Mouse, AAA i forgot his name, he was so cute, as well as Trumpkin, i hearted them both, they were so adorable -the acting was quite good, tho i didn't like Lucy and Susan much, I'm glad that so many people outside Hollywood got a chance, it came to a point that i was shocked to see the much lighter skinned extras ;)-the New Zealand scenery was breath-taking, the sets and and the landscape were SO beautiful!!!apart from that the movie was well-paced, and the action scenes were well co-ordinated, and i like the fact that everyone got hit equally, tho it is annoying to see all the arrows somehow miss the protagonists! all in all it was an entertaining movie and it's not a waste of money, i quite enjoyed myself, i think the song at the end was the main reason why i left the hall with a smile on my face :) it was so infectious, tho when it started i must admit i was like...AAA kill me now, isn't this the most generic thing ever!?!? i.e song playing at end of movie...SORRY FOR MAKING YOU READ ALL OF THAT!!! ;p",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

I even dare to say that it's better than the first one.Not a single boring moment, loads of action and magnificent stunts, full of magic -couldn't expect less-, music that makes you feel Narnia.William Moseley: Totally hot. His character shows a lot of braveness, leadership and attitude that makes him oh-so-attractive. Ben is too sexy. Like too sexy. And Skandar... *sigh* I don't know if it's because he looks a little too much like H -gotta stop thinking about him though- but he totally stole my heart in this movie, I couldn't stop myself from drooling at his beauty, even if he's way younger than me.But OK, leaving aside the hotness of the cast, it really is an amazing movie.

361,joshmcgee-1,Not for fans of the book,6,20 May 2008,"Over all, I thought Prince Caspian was a good action picture with special effects that you would expect from the series. However, for those like me who are fans of the C.S. Lewis series, this picture falls way short.While doing the screenplay for this movie, the writer's must have relied on cliffs notes instead of actually reading the book. I found that there were many scenes that were either changed drastically or were not in the book to begin with. Including an instance where the Narnians attempt to take Miraz's castle, which never occurred in the book. Also, it seemed that they tried too hard to throw as much action into the movie as they possibly could. This diminished opportunities to build upon the rich characters and relationships that C.S. Lewis created. Two good examples of this were Trufflehunter and Doctor Cornelius. Both of these characters were prominent in the book and had vital roles. However, in the movie they were barely an afterthought.Overall, if you're going to see this movie because you want to see a blockbuster movie with good special effects, you won't be disappointed. However, if you go as a fan of the book, go expecting to see a movie and not a retelling of an amazing story.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
362,twotalentguy-1,"Outstanding movie, though not for young viewers.",10,17 May 2008,"This movie was much more violent than the first, but it was very evened out. The violence did not hinder the emotional moments involving Aslan, and the humor is also strewn throughout (usually involving Trumpkin). The acting was superb with all characters, and no one character was a screen hog. There was everything you could want from a movie - moral lessons, violence (if you're into that, it's your lucky day, although no blood is seen), humor, and even a bit of romance. This movie, I believe, ups the ante a bit for the rest of the following movies. Comparatively, this was definitely a step-up from the previous movie, though the two cannot really be judged by the same standards; the first was a very ""innocent"" movie, introducing the world of Narnia, while this movie assumes most people know about it.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
363,Elizabeth178,A Must See Narnian Adventure,10,16 May 2008,"It is not completely necessary to have seen the Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe to understand Prince Caspian but it is recommended as there are sure to be more CoN movies to come. (The Voyage of the Dawn is slated to come out in 2010.) Movie sequels have a lot to live up to, especially to the first movie and sometimes they never do succeed but I was not at all disappointed with Prince Caspian. It is a sequel worthy of the first CoN; it doesn't beat it but it certainly isn't considered an underachievement. (I can't say the same for the Harry Potter series.) The CGI, visuals and costumes are simply amazing, it even tops the last CoN movie. It is pretty authentic and true to the book (at least that I can remember), which is always a plus for me. I think Ben Barnes plays Prince Caspian very well. It is another Narnian adventure and I look forward to seeing a third on screen Narnian adventure! -- Remember you need to believe to see Aslan! The character, Reepicheep, the knighted Narnian mouse is simply ""cute""! -- Rating: 10/10",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
364,jlackey-14184,I don't remember being this disappointed in a movie,2,17 January 2021,"First, the good:TrufflehunterNext, the bad:Literally everything else.This movie was awful, I wish I could say differently. It seems as if they took the book plot line, cut it up, shook it up in a bag, and pulled out different pieces. Plot points were out of order. There were totally made up plot points. Storming Miraz's castle? I'm pretty sure they specifically decided against that in the book.80 percent of the book plot was done in the first hour. This is always a bad sign in a 2.5 hour movie.Aslan is a fundamentally different character and they completely miss the fact that (according to Lewis here) Aslan is Christ. Not an allegory of Christ, he is Christ. In the book, Aslan removes the bridge in order to restore his creation. In the movie, the river essentially fixes itself. This is completely out of step with the Christological nature of Aslan, who has much more time in the book. Aslan is relegated to the role of powerful alarm clock to wake up the trees and the water. The scene (I believe this had a whole chapter in the book) where Aslan heals his creation and helps the Telmarines (Caspian's nurse included) is completely absent.Peter and Susan have had their characters butchered. Susan is a love interest despite this never being even hinted at in the book. Peter is a jerk, and a bully. Lucy remains alright, Edmund is essentially a background character.Overall, I think this is a example of what happens when you take a story which is so obviously Christian and try to strip it of all Christian themes. The story falls apart and you end up having to make what boils down to a lukewarm coming of age fantasy. If Clive Staples Lewis was not resting in the care of the Lord he would be weeping after seeing what was done to his work. I am disgusted.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

366,flowerpower22,Too long and uninspiring,2,10 August 2009,"I watched this last night for the first time, and begun looking at my watch about 20mins in. Whilst I appreciated the special effects and ambition of the film I must concur with most of what has already been said. The acting was wooden from most of the children, although the script didn't invite much from them, and whilst I felt Susan was growing up, Peter didn't appear to be turning into an adult at all. The two younger children where OK but a little too old for the parts and if begs the question after the time delay how they will look in the next one! The whole film took for ever to get resolved and the character development non-existent.My two children who watched it with me were very disappointed and all in all I for one will not be rushing to see anymore of this franchise.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
367,dragonforce52087-1,Not very good,4,16 May 2008,"I went into ""Prince Caspian"" with high expectations. We all know that C.S. Lewis is a terrific author and that the movie adaptation of his story ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" from 2005 was impressive. I assumed that ""Prince Caspian"" would build on this momentum and end up being good. I was very wrong.I realize that this movie was made for kids mostly, but that's no excuse for bad filmaking. I love plenty of kids movies - ""Toy Story"", ""Beauty and the Beast"", and ""The Incredibles"", just to name a few. My issues with the movie had nothing to do with its target audience, its production values, the acting, or its religious positions. My problems were simply with the way it was made, the movie part of it. What some people need to realize is that big budgets, incredible graphics, and huge sets do not make good movies, they make what's there better.In a nutshell, here's the problem with ""Prince Caspian"": It's a movie that is very long, but has no real dramatic subject matter. It has a weak story (perhaps the director's fault, not Lewis) that on it's own, should have been only an hour long. This one hour movie was stretched to over twice that length. It gets boring at parts, grows very confusing, and lacks deep themes and drama. If you think about it, an hour long movie simply does not have enough subject matter to keep it afloat anyways. Despite it's length, ""Prince Caspian"" didn't have a lot of say, it was never moving, I never feared for any of the characters, and it lacked any kind of emotion.As far as action is concerned, there is plenty in this movie. There are two large battles and small bits of fighting scattered all about the movie. Unlike ""The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe"" though, ""Prince Caspian"" lacks any large scale, epic battle scene. The fights that exists are not built up to at all and thus, are not very exciting. They seem to just pop up and happen.As far as characters are concerned, ""Prince Caspian"" lacked real character development. I for one, enjoyed the kids in the first movie, but here, they were very bland. None of them had anything they needed to change/solve by the end internally or with other people in the story. All they had to do was fight which is just not enough to keep characters on a heroic level. Every character needs conflict and needs something more than just a sword in their hand. None of the characters in ""Prince Caspian"" had this extra something. Caspian himself made little sense in terms of motives, but did have a very small, and not very developed, quarrel with Peter (briefly).I found myself saying far too often ""why did they just say that?"" or ""why was this in the movie?"" or ""why did that person do that?"" and I never got any answers by the film's end. I realize that not everything in a movie should make sense and that not everything is important enough to be a problem when not understood. That is not the case here. There were a lot of very cloudy motives and a lot of unnecessary lines of dialog that only confused the audience. There were plenty of small scenes that could have easily been cut out and it would not have mattered at all structurally. Very confusing for not good reason.Simply put, Prince Caspian is not very good at all. To understand this, one must really see it for himself, but prepare to be disappointed. Fans need to understand that just because C.S. Lewis is a great author and wrote a great book, but that doesn't mean that this particular movie adaptation was good. Also, graphics and visual thrills do not make a movie great.Disappointed.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

Sure a few things were changed, but the spirit is there.The acting is first rate. The plot may be even better than the book. Forget the protests about added romance.

371,EvilSorcerer4,Literally the worst movie adaptation I have ever seen,1,26 May 2008,"According to the Wikipedia article, the directors decided to take ""Caspian"" in a darker direction -- and boy howdy, did they succeed! C.S. Lewis's ""Prince Caspian"" was a bright and cheering children's book; Andrew Adamson's ""Caspian"" is a morally ambiguous soap opera filled with horrific battle scenes. Lewis centered ""Caspian"" around the children's trek to Aslan's How, on which Lucy, then Edmund, Peter, and finally Susan begin to see Aslan ahead of them on the trail; but this central scene is only alluded to in the movie with a couple of lines of bad dialogue. The next most important scene, the ""Romp"" with Aslan, is left out entirely, in favor of a bloody battle at Miraz's castle made up by the director.This isn't like the first movie, in which they screwed up the theology. ""Caspian"" presents no theological interest at all. Aslan never appears until the very end, and is presented basically as a ""tame lion"" (he doesn't even shake Trumpkin!). Trumpkin's atheism is played down so far as to be nonexistent; his dialogue implies that he accepts the reality of Aslan from the beginning. While Caspian does reject Nikabrik's evil scheme (the director couldn't very well cut this third critical scene, given that it provided Tilda Swinton's only chance for a cameo), you'll notice that Caspian's army is still full of Minotaurs and Wolves, and early on one character (Trumpkin?) asserts that ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend"" without being rebuked by the children. (Adamson seems to have had something of a minotaur fetish. The battle at the castle is full of lingering shots of dying minotaurs. Never mind that Minotaurs are evil Narnians, or that Lewis's book didn't even mention them.) Adamson adds a pointless and rather insulting ""character flaw"" for Peter (he's turned into a touchy brawler with a chip on his shoulder, whom the now-decent Edmund has to keep saving); Susan's grown-up girliness is communicated mainly by a pointless and rather insulting ""romance"" with Caspian. Edmund, on the other hand, is made out to be a decent guy, which is in keeping with Lewis's book --- perhaps too decent, since the writers give all his catty comments to the others, making even Lucy seem a bit of a prig. (Peter: ""can't keep a map in their heads"". Lucy: ""our Dear Little Friend"".) Yes, the D.L.F. is alluded to in one brief exchange, then promptly forgotten again. Speaking of lost opportunities for comic relief, the Bulgy Bears have disappeared --- is this really a Disney film? The only belly laugh in the movie (albeit totally unintended) is the first bit of Reepicheep's death scene, when the mice's bagpipe music had everyone next to me anxiously checking their cell phones.Oh yeah, and for some reason all the Telmarines (even Caspian himself) speak with thick spaghetti-Western accents, rendering half their lines unintelligible to an American audience. Luckily, they're usually just talking politics, or engaging in bedside Mexican standoffs ripped from the latest telenovela.Zero stars (out of five) for the worst adaptation since Tim Burton's ""Planet of the Apes"". See it if you must, but in the words of Dave Chappelle, ""Better not bring your kids!"" There's nothing in this mess for them.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
372,jjansky_1026-1,Could have been much better...,1,20 May 2008,The real crime in this movie is the extra stories that are added to Lewis' original story. I know books are much more in-depth when it comes to story telling but we have see great books come to life on the big screen. Why does this one seem so difficult for the writers and director to get right? The scenery in the film if wonderful but that's where the wonderful stops. The Kings and Queens of Narnia are not convincing in their return roles as heroes of Narnia. Instead they seem extremely childish and their characters never move past this. Prince Caspien is dull and the woodland creatures are all too anxious to follow this dull uninspiring Talmarine. Overall the film is disjointed and really never captures the audiences' attention. Think of it as the Lord of the Rings with only the Frodo and Sam parts. A lot of walking.,The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
373,bet410,Excellent sequel,9,24 May 2008,"Admittedly, I'm very much a fan of children's literature, having taught elementary school for most of my life. I've read the Chronicles of Narnia series several times (including certain books orally to my class from time to time), and Prince Caspian has always tied with The Horse and His Boy for my least favorite. That said, I read the comments before going to see the movie. With all the negative comments and my feelings toward the book in comparison with the other books in the series, I went in with the expectation that I would most likely be very disappointed by PC. However, I was pleasantly surprised! Not only was I NOT disappointed, but I was so involved in the movie that I found myself shaking almost the entire way through the long battle sequences.I came home and reread the reviews, both good and bad, and went back again to see the movie a second time. I tried to find the bad acting in it and just didn't see it at all! I thought the children had matured very well, and I was glad to see some emphasis on Peter and Susan since William Moseley and Anna Popplewell will virtually be out of the series after this movie. I look forward to seeing Skandar Keynes and Georgie Henley reprise their rolls of Edmund and Lucy again in Voyage of the Dawn Treader. They did an excellent job in PC! One of my favorite characters in the series was introduced in PC. Reepicheep was absolutely delightful, adding just the right amount of humor in tense situations. He was just as I'd pictured him, and I'm anxious to see more of him in VDT. Trumpkin was also wonderful, exhibiting just the right level of gruffness. I was very pleased that Harry Gregson Williams expanded upon many of his musical themes from LWW while introducing new themes. The theme from the battle scene in LWW was so powerful that I had hoped to hear it again, and I was very happy that it appeared again in PC, adding to the continuity of the series. Of course my favorite new theme was the muted-trumpet theme of Reepicheep that appeared in the attack on the castle. It was the perfect choice for the small, brave mouse. All in all, I thought the movie was very well-done. I look forward to seeing it again.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

There was nothing in the movie that made it bad at all, i do think there could've been more blood and violence, because that makes the intense battle sequences more effective, but for a PG movie, BRAVO!

375,martyshrimp,Not very impressed!,6,1 November 2008,"I'm a die-hard Narnia (C.S. Lewis) fan and both the Disney adaptations of Narnia have been somewhat shallow, and utterly disappointing. So much of Prince Caspian is actually missing in this adaptation- from the Pevensie children's travels from their London station, to their magical journey back into Narnia, subsequent hunger, and then re-discovering Cair Paravel (its ruins). What makes the book so special are the intricate details of how they find the apple orchards, how they eventually find out that it is their castle, and how they work out that one year in our world counts as 1300 years in Narnian time, and how they travel from Cair Paravel to Aslan's How. All that is missing in this movie.I love the simplicity of the Narnia books, how they understand the simple things in the lives of children. The movie makes all these simplicities oddly-placed. The Cair Paravel scene was pretty good all the same. Sadly, most of the film does not follow the book. The children do not meet Caspian in the woods. Peter's character is sheer disappointment. The High King Peter behaves with an air of understanding, responsibility throughout the book, so it is discouraging to see him fight with kids in the station, and also how he behaves occasionally throughout the film. That's the fault with the screenplay and not the acting.Reepicheep was the nicest character, I felt. Lucy was good too. Edmund was good too. I would have expected the characters of the others to be a little different than in the movie. The locations and music, accompanied by great cinematography is what helps the film, despite several drawbacks. Though these cinematic elements are still not enough to cover up the messy screenplay. I love the music, and Harry Gregson-Williams has done an excellent job in both the films. I spotted out themes from Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.After an hour of the movie passed by, I began feeling quite depressed. The scenes in the tomb were absolutely not necessary. One, they did not exist in the book. Peter did not command his authority by force; everyone recognised his authority, including Caspian. Here, Peter was portrayed almost in a negative, problematic manner. The irony is, however, by the time Peter met Caspian, he had already met Aslan. The other point is that Cornelius meets with Caspian in the forest, when he calls upon the meeting with all the animals. The rescue mission to the castle and all the other elements added were absolutely unnecessary and untrue to the book. And this chemistry between Susan and Caspian- that goes overboard! This isn't a romantic tale- one, Caspian is truly supposed to be only 12 years old or so, and secondly, Susan and Caspian hardly meet much in reality. Another fact the writers ignored was that Susan wasn't much of a fighter. She wasn't expected to be in war, and her character made her not fight too much. She was good at swimming, an excellent archer, but she wasn't meant to fight in battles, as Aslan had said.I must say, however, that the vivid images from the book make this film look shabby sometimes. I need to read the book again, now, to forget the lapses in this film, and to remind me that Prince Caspian is a wonderful book; it's a pity that with the resources, locations, music and everything the producers had- they still couldn't convince me that this was a story from Narnia.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
376,Bb-rDw,Great movie and great story!,10,19 September 2008,"When I went to watch this movie for the first time I wasn't that excited. I was never a great Narnia fan but Prince Caspian was a great movie. It's so much better than the first one.The acting was great too - Great afford from the five main characters, Georgie Henley, Skandar Keynes, William Moseley, Ben Barnes and Anna Popplewell.I like the change of Prince Caspian's look.. I always imagined him the way Ben Barnes is in this movie!The only problem with it is that there's kinda no blood. I get it that this movie isn't for adults only so, it's not that bad. Personally I am not that kind of person that Love to see blood in a movie so that wasn't so bad.For all those people who didn't like this movie maybe its just the story or you don't like this kind of movies..

377,wild_spot,Hmmm...,6,23 June 2008,"I went into the movie both very excited and a bit apprehensive. Having read all of the Narnia books numerous times, I was a bit nervous at the comments I had read detailing the movies departure from the original storyline. Nonetheless, I really enjoyed The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe.I have to say, I was disappointed from the very start. The movie portrays Peter as a self-important brat, not someone who has learned and earned nobility because of his time in Narnia. The fight in the train station is the first of many diversions from the book, and the first of many unnecessary ones.At the very start, the director's choice to scrap the story told by Trumpkin to the Pevensies starts the movie off missing a lot of information. In the book, the story sets the stage for the rest of the book, and explains how the Telmarines came to rule Narnia, and so on. Also, the battle of skills between Trumpkin and Susan, and then Edmund, is shortened and done out of context. In the movie I hardly understood why Edmund was fighting Trumpkin, and Susan didn't even get a look in.They then went on to cut the journey which makes up more than half of the book. They do find the river Rush much changed, and Lucy spies Aslan when the others do not, but the dreariness and the confusion of the children in this new Narnia is skimmed over. The bridge of Beruna, which in the book has existed long before the children return to Narnia, is only just being built.Once the children meet up with Caspian and make their way to the How, the director has taken far too much liberty. Peter becomes the instigator of a foolish and poorly planned attack on the castle of Miraz, which results in half the Narnian's being slaughtered due to Caspian's anger over the death of his father and Peter's refusal to accept defeat until nearly too late. This episode shows Peter as a foolish and headstrong boy, not peter the Magnificent, and Caspian as an impulsive and selfish Prince, driven only by thoughts of revenge. In the book, peter and Caspian are friends, and together strive to defeat Miraz. In the movie, they bicker and fight for control.The scene where Nikabrik and his friends attempt to summon the white witch was almost traitorous to the book, but a very spectacular scene. In the book, neither Caspian nor Peter entertained the though of summoning the White Witch for even a second.The remainder of the movie, the single combat between peter and Miraz and the resulting storming of the How by Miraz' army remain truer to the book. I can understand the liberties taken to improve the battle scenes. There are a few scenes at the end that I would have liked to see, the river god asking Aslan to free him from his chains, the celebration with Bacchus and his wild girls, and the schoolchildren turning into pigs. They all provided an element of comedy in the book, which was missing from the Movie. I won't go into the 'romance' between Susan and Caspian, as romance was never a part of Lewis' novels, and should never have been included. Plus, Caspian ends up with Ramandu's daughter.However, there were some very good points. I loved the portrayal of Reepicheep and Trumpkin, and also Trufflehunter. They had to do a good job of creating Reepicheep, as he is such a pivotal character in the next book. The battle scenes were spectacular, and I loved how they made trees come alive. It evoked lots of emotion, which I love in a movie.I think I was spoiled for the movie by reading the book. The friend I went with, who hasn't read the book, said she loved the movie, and more than the first. As a stand alone movie, it really was quite good, but comparing it to the book is hardly possible.I really hope they continue on to Dawn Treader, if any book was ready made to become a movie, this was it. I can't wait.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
378,confused_catling,Wonderfully done if not a bit middle earth feeling,8,17 May 2008,"I loved this movie, it was excellent to see how well the movie stuck with the book and all the same actors played their parts so well. The panoramic feel of the movie was incredible and the locations were superb. Seeing how the characters grew through the year was also interesting to see how living life as a royal and then back to the start could change a person. The one thing I might have to knock down was the last battle in which Aslan awoke the trees. First thought that came to mind ""The Ents take a walk"". Although it was a masterpiece to include the mystical workings of Narnia it was a bit of a let down to see the same great battle techniques as seen in LOTR. All in all it was a great movie and would definitely see again!",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
379,minus_zero99,my quick little say!!!,5,28 May 2008,"Caspian. What Can I say. Who is He? Really. Sequel to the Lion, witch and the wardrobe but doesn't fall anywhere close to the first movie. The movie started off with a little bit of interest but fell flat going forward. The same four main characters returned to reprise their role in this slow going sequel. Old characters gone for certain reasons that pertain to the movies premise. New characters were brought upon this current big screen disappointment. Couple new characters were cute but with no real personality that hasn't already been portrayed in other movies. People that have read the series might have liked the movie a lot more then the people who haven't. The battle scenes were in no way spectacular or original. I would have to say this movie was full of nice little cute faces but in no way inspirational or in any way a wowing movie.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
380,Bubbasage_00,Worst sequel to date.,2,20 May 2008,"Their is not one original idea in the entire two and a half hours of this movie, Every epic and emotionally jarring scene has been done before from. The gladiator esquire masks the army wears. to the very TROY fighting style of King peter. Not to mention the ending which was the worst part I could do nothing but sit back and think my god I've already seen this done before. The constant ""borrowing"" of themes from LOTR are just getting old. I know that the two authors were friends and shared many ideas but that gives no right to the director of Narnia to just shoot the same scenes as Peter Jackson. And for a you know what really grinds my gears moment. WHY THE HECK does prince Caspian talk in a Spanish accent the whole time he spoke I couldn't stop thinking about Inigo Montoya from A princess bride.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

382,jm_chapman2007,Lost the Magic of the First Movie,6,18 May 2008,"I have a lot of trouble saying that I enjoyed the movie. I've read the book series several times, so I was thrown when the movie started with the birth of Miraz's son and was shortly followed by Caspian blowing Susan's Horn. I felt that the movie skipped a huge opportunity to build up Caspian's character and mindset, as well as Miraz's paranoia towards Narnia, by jumping to the birthing scene. Movie-goers who've never read the book really wouldn't understand why Caspian would be safe in the woods, or why Miraz's council was missing so many members. I also felt that Caspian using the horn when he did, rather than using it after he had already built up an army and had already lost several key battles, took away from his character development. The film, by having the Pevensie children come in so early, made it seem as though the Pevensies were the military geniuses. As a result, when Caspian states that he did not feel ready to be king, the movie audience wouldn't see that as a humble statement. I was confused by the siege of the castle scene, though the justification given in the FAQ makes some sense - I just don't see why it was given so much screen time. And the romance between Susan and Caspian was very odd, unless they placed that in there to allude to The Last Battle, where Susan didn't join the rest of the Pevensies because of her interest in make-up and boys.As one who's read the books, I didn't enjoy this movie as much as I enjoyed The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe. My husband, who has only read TLTWATW, also did not enjoy the Prince Caspian movie. He felt that the opening scene was confusing because it thrust the audience into the middle of the action, with little to no discussion on what led up to that night. He also felt that the characters weren't well-developed.I'm still trying to understand the justification for Peter's rudeness throughout the movie.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
383,SevenFlorins,"So much potential, but so little understanding...",1,20 May 2008,"I blissfully sat down in my carefully chosen seat placed in the center of the screen at eye level and began rocking my chair in anxious anticipation. I had told myself I would never watch another Chronicles of Narnia movie made by Walden Media after the butchering of the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe, which stripped the storyline of the book down to a skeleton and then plastered modern themes and jokes back on, creating a Frankenstonian monster perfectly happy to leave C.S. Lewis fans screaming in horror. But I thought that just maybe they had a change of heart after the first movie got such bad reviews and how many people (that I know anyway) hated it. Even a friend of mine who never read the books admitted that the BBC versions (which follow as much of the storyline as possible almost word for word with their limited technology) were better than the new films. There was so much potential after all if the BBC versions could get so amazingly close. I should have blissfully left the theater right then in my ignorance of what was to come, but that's the problem with ignorance. You don't realize when you're about to stumble upon something that will shatter your bliss. Within the first few minutes of the movie Caspian unloads his lungs into Susan's microscopically designed horn. For you readers who know the storyline, he hadn't even made it into the hut with Trufflehunter, Nickabrick, and Trumpkin yet. He falls off his horse, sees good old Nickabrick and, digging deep into his guts for bravery, snatches up the horn and does his thing as if thinking, ""Oh s***! It's a midget with a sword half the length of my pinky! I need help NOW!!!"" That's the kind of courage I want my kids to see when they're growing up.Needless to say because of the premature honkingthey cut the part where he gets introduced to the creatures such as Glenstorm and the three bears and the fauns and the little squirrel which they pathetically try to throw in later. They also cut the battle Prince Caspian fights ON HIS OWN BECAUSE HE ACTUALLY HAS A PAIR AND DOESN'T FAINT AT THE THOUGHT OF MIDGET MEN WITH NEEDLES! I wanted to see the fightI wanted to see the Giant screw up and make the Narnians get demolished. NOOOO, the writers have a better idea. Lets replace the blame on Peter because he's only the freakin' high king of Narnia who everyone looks up to and compares other kings to (although you'd never know why the &%$@ he's thought of so highly the way he's always screwing up and getting scolded by the Prim Dona Susan for not taking care of siblings or, in this case, getting his entire army massacred in a battle that never should have existed.) Peter was a heronot the scapegoat that he is in these movies.This next fact should be so obviously horrifying that I'm not sure I can even write an entire paragraph explaining my frustration unless I speak at the level of kindergartners. Aslan was basically nonexistent. He appeared in what? Three scenes at the most??? Four if you count the short dream sequence that, oh wait, SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN A SHORT DREAM BUT A GOOD TALK BETWEEN ASLAN AND LUCY! WTF are these writers on? Crack? And oh yeah what happened to the entire part where Lucy and Susan stay with Aslan during the battle and wake up the trees with him and meet Bacchus and other such dancing people?oh right they had to ride back to find him because they went off to war with Peter and Edmund. What ever happened to the idea of ""wars are nasty affairs when girls are involved?"" It must have been overturned somewhere because Susan (in her best imitation of the Elves from Lord of the Rings) was down in the battle showing more gumption, skill, and balls than anything which might have even flickered in the eyes of Prince Caspian. Caspian's entire manhood was thrown into question so bad that the writers must have decided that the kiss between Susan and Caspian at the end was necessary, if not for the simple act of modernization, then to assure the audience that Caspian was, in fact, not gay.If the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe was turned into a Frankenstein of the original story, Prince Caspian was turned into an Ameba of the original story. After prince Caspian tooted his horn, the skeleton itself disappeared leaving a spineless story attempting to morph into something simply bearable to watch without causing me to burst into tears over the latest victim of C.S. Lewis' stories to Hollywood and the modern culture perfectly happy to accept it.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

The first Narnia is good and i like it a lot. But this time, The Caspian is freaking boring. The character development and the plot flowing is so bad that i nearly come out from the theater after the half of the movie. The environment of the Narnia world is even worse. it simply just a forest without some fantasy things at all! All my friend agree with me that the movie is terrible.

387,Kerfuddled,I Very much enjoyed it,9,17 May 2008,"Im the type of teenager who only listens to film soundtracks and spends her days on IMDb and watching movies, and I thought that as far as sequels go, this was another one (like any Harry Potter after sorcerers stone, and pirates of the Caribbean after the black pearl)that lives up to the first film. I have watched the first Narnia so many times that I have every line memorized (including everything they say in the commentaries) and my play count for the soundtrack on Itunes is over 5000 times now. I am a Disney/Film freak and this is one of my favorites lately, of course it falls behind the first movie and all of the pirate movies. When I first saw the trailer for this at Disney World's Journey into Narnia, I was about to jump up and hug the screen. They were very right though, in saying that it would be near impossible to live up to the Lion Witch and the Wardrobe, but this one did well. I found the fighting better and a little less ""innocent"" so to say. I also really love Prince Caspian *girlish sigh*. I went immediately to see it last night (i skipped our schools talent show and a few other things just to see it) and am glad I went. The only problem for me was I thought that it ended to quickly, it was almost as if they ran out of filming time so they ended all of the battling with the water and bridge. Sorry for any of you who have read the books and didn't like this movie, because without having the book in my brain, it was great. Also, if anyone gets the chance, listen to the soundtrack also, Harry Gregson-Williams, who if some of you remember also did the music for Shrek and The Lion witch and wardrobe, is a Movie score genius. The soundtrack is very good, and Switchfoot's song is what makes it great I think.

388,alfmorten-1,"Only the names have not been changed, to protect the ..what?",1,29 June 2008,"I must say I am sorry that Disney are allowed to take such freedoms in making a script. This movie has so few parallels to the original story, that they might as well have made it as another movie. On top of what, they manage to create a action/drama, out of an fantasy story written for children. I suppose they want to cash in as much as possible rather than making a good movie.The movie in itself is not that bad, it has the ingredients to make it a good movie. But sorry to say they manage to cut away all the parts that matters in the whole of the book. First off: They change the circumstances where Caspian blows the horn, thereby altering the reason why Nicabrick is taken to the lagoon by Cair Paravel, and then by making them meet up with Caspian again before any fighting has taken place, the whole plot is turned upside down.Secondly:Why did the dwarf get the nickname DLF? or dear little friend as it is, this is skipped making one of the nice little punchlines in the book go away. Third: Why o why did they have to twist the whole thing over to becoming a tale of fighting? This is no movie for kids anymore, the whole thing is far to dark and sinister for any 5-10 year old's to watch.Fourth: Wheres Bacchus, the tree spirits and all the wonderful things form the books? The list goes on and on unfortunately, and thats why I feel inclined to give the movie only 1 star. I would have given none had the rating allowed so, not because of the movie being bad, but because I feel this is a mockery of one of the greatest children books series ever written.Get your story right Disney, this is supposed to be for kids and not a action drama that is about slaughtering each other.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

The acting from new and returning characters is amazing, and the stakes are so much higher; that is sets the stage for a climatic fight that is one of the best you could possibly ever see on screen.Watching Peter and the gang come back after a year and see them jump right in and risk their lives, mix that with the great special effects and story; it leaves you wanting more.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

The movie is close to the book (not sure what others users mean by saying it is not). Sure, like all films from novels the Producers take some liberty to change things here and there...but in general the story remains close to the book by CS Lewis.

391,lolliepop121,Not to Bad,9,22 May 2008,"It was a pretty good movie the first was better but for my personal opinion out of the series that was my least favorite book. So for me it was pretty good. Most of the movie was battle after battle after battle.Which is good for some people. Edmund surprised me actually by being more of a humble, hard-working leader than Peter who actually seemed to be more immature. Excellent cast, great filming, OK cinematography, fair lighting. Don't stay after the movie though to ""Go back to Narnia"" as in the first when little Lucy went to (or tried to) go back. I sat through the whole credits and even when we were leaving i looked back hoping for a little glimpse to keep me excited for the the next one. Their entrance to it was as good as the first and some of the little things you will notice are awesome. Of course there had to be romance (which could have been there without) and at one point you think that Lucy might be going to Mr. Tumnus' house or even the lampost. It was everything I ever expected it to be and so much more. For a big as fan of Narnia buff as I am I can hardly wait for the next one. But patience is a virtue so i will wait till then. In a series most of the second ones are the flop, I hope their wont ever be a flop with this series. The movie leaves you wanting to go watch it again and again. With the hope that this time you will end up going there yourself It goes to fast and it leaves you with that one little inkling that maybe it does exist and for you to go find it. So keep your imagination as wide as your eyes are and pray that they don't make a spoof out of this movie.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
392,gobryanin,If u love Narnia.... You will love this movie.,8,17 May 2008,"The chronicles of Narnia holds a special place in my heart as it was the first story book series I ever read. Therefore, I usually catch the corresponding movies first day first show and this time was no exception. This movie is not suitable for those who do not love fantasy or the magical world of Narnia. The first half is slightly slow, as is usually the case with Narnia movies, since it builds the entire plot. However, Prince Caspian is considerably longer than its previous, ranging 1.3 hrs just for the first half. Il tell u the truth, if u r a fantasy lover then there are far better titles in the market to watch and get fantasized. Narnian fans will adore the movie, since it captures the magical world in its full essence throughout the movie, coupled with extensive shots of the four children who are destined to save Narnia from the hands of the tamarinds. The special effects towards the end is awesome. The only down point I found was the very very late introduction of Aslan ( the magical Lion) and although he saves the day... you just cant get enough of him.. the computer graphics is just wonderful. Prince Caspian doesn't have a strong character, it seems peter is leading all the way but thats cool. The most important factor is the director spins the movie from the book very well, without omitting any important events. This idea of continuum is extremely important to fantasy tales. Plus I think the powers of the children are exhibited well. Lucy and her affinity to nature and faith in ""belief and hope"". Peter - active, leadership.. acts with his brain and not his heart. Edmond is practical, and in this movie - strangely bears a responsible character. I think poor prince Caspian is outshone by the four. I would recommend this movie as :8.5/10 - if u r a Narnia fan !7.5/10 - if u love fantasy movies !6.5/10 - others",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
393,longhorn821,"So Good, but not too Loyal",9,17 May 2008,"This was so much better than the first, but it was not as loyal to the book as The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe was. There was a lot of added plots, like the relationship between Caspian and Susan. Also, Prince Caspian is supposed to be a 13-year-old boy according to the book, whereas they casted Ben Barnes, who is most definitely not 13! Apparently this was done in order to show the ""relationship"" between him and Peter. In my opinion, it was a GREAT choice- how the two of them balanced each other out was perfect. And the relationship between the four Pevensies was so much better. The most astonishing part of the movie though was how much they all have grown up. Edmond, played by Skandar Keynes, turned into quite the heartthrob and was so much more confident in his role. Lucy, played by Georgie Henley, was incredible as always. And Peter and Susan, played by William Mosely and Anna Popplewell respectively, were so much more mature and wonderful as always. This is a MUST SEE!",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
394,RedDiamond,Terrific Entertainment,9,17 May 2008,"First off, just to make it clear, I am a Narnia fan and have been since I was eight years old. Prince Caspian is not my favorite Narnia story. Still, I was angry with all the changes I'd been hearing of during the last few months. But, after seeing PC last night, I have to say I thought it was a fantastic movie. I'm looking at Prince CAspian from an entertainment point of view and as a movie, it is awesome. The visual effects are beautiful. The battle scenes are impressive. Skandar Keynes is the best Pevensie, by far. Peter Dinklage stole the whole show as Trumpkin. Reepicheep and the mice were not in it as much as they should have been, but they still managed to steal every scene they were in. Yes, the original story has been altered, but I found many references from the book in the film. Almost everything that happens in the book happens in the movie, just at different times and events are embellished. My complaints are few...One being the lack of development in Prince Caspians character--by the end of the film, he still feels like a stranger. You get that he's a sort of humble young man who is Prince Caspian, but that is strictly it. Not enough development!!!!! ALso, this movie most certainly deserves a PG-13 rating. I wouldn't take a small child to see it. The very first scene is a woman screaming in childbirth, and the battles are quite violent--at one point, a soldier is beheaded. Overall, PC, in my opinion, is an excellent film. Not like the book, but I believe the changes have been made for the better. I look forward to seeing Voyage of the Dawn Treader.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

I don't want to give any details of the movie because I don't want to spoil it for anyone. However I thought the movie was slow. I don't want to hear it's because it's a British movie or some nonsense like that, because I enjoy those types of movies more so then the American action movies that people seem to be so fond of.

396,mhmartin86,better as a book *contains spoiler*,5,16 May 2008,"I just got finished watching a preview of the movie for the employees at the movie theater that i work at. i have to say it was very disappointing. i've read all the books and i will tell you that if you have read the book recently you will probably be disappointed also. things that should've happened in the middle of the movie happened at the end and things that should've happened at the middle happened at the start. they never establish the connection between caspian and his tutor, nor the connection between him and his uncle until half way through the movie. you don't know why caspian is living with his uncle until almost the end of the movie. they never show that caspian loved the stories of old narnia and wanted to find the talking animals and dwarfs nor do they tell you his tutor is 1/2 dwarf until the end. they led you to believe that caspian doesn't believe in the narnia stories or even think the talking animals still exist. in the book caspian blows the horn during battle knowing what it is, who it belonged to, and having a fairly good idea as to what it will do. in the movie however he just blows it in about the first 15min with no idea as to what it is. which also screws up the soldiers taking to dwarf captive which in the book they do when he is going to look for the help that is supposed to come from the horn and he gets taken to some random soldiers fort and they send him off to the ghosts in the movie they take him to miraz who is not king but in the book he was, after killing lots of people and threatening the rest. also they attack the castle in the movie WHAT!?!?! there is no way that would have happened in the book. AND for all of you complaining about the white witch barely making an appearance in this movie, lets hope you don't read the book because she NEVER shows her face in the book and i wish they wouldn't have put that in this movie. aslan came in way to late, and whats up with that. i wanted so badly to see the party with Bacchus and all the crazy stuff they did in all the towns to ""free the people"" and how the nickname ""DLF"" was established was just all wrong, edmund was supposed to give him that nickname b/c dlf kept calling edmund little.i think that if you haven't read the book then you will enjoy this movie BUT if you've read the book then you will probably be disappointed. i wish they would make movies out of the rest of the books. magicians nephew is so great all about how narnia was formed and it seems to have been overlooked along with the horse and his boy. so sad.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
397,velvetstars,Seven reasons to see this movie,8,16 May 2008,I have to admit that I was somewhat reluctant going to see this movie because I thought the first was lacking in many ways. First of all I would have to say the characters where more developed which connected to the audience giving a more intimate inclination. Second there were more action sequences which lasted much longer than the first movie. Third the special effects were more realistic. Fourth the actors/actresses embodied the characters persona which kept you focused on the story line. Fifth there is more comedy than the first although I would stress it is infrequent. Sixth the stunning visual settings add an additional amount of realism. Seven although a bit predictable the combination of the above will keep you on the edge of your seat. I would highly recommend this movie if you liked the first but expected more.,The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
398,lodijee,it might have been better if i hadn't read the book,6,16 May 2008,"I am a Narnia obsessed nerd, so of course I went to see it the night it was released. I had very high expectations because the first movie was so true to the book. However, with this film that wasn't the case. The screen play was pretty much completely rewritten and included only hints of the original story. I suppose Disney felt it necessary to add in lame typical movie elements that attract mainstream moviegoers. For example a sub-plot romance between Caspian and Susan and battles that never existed. This movie not only failed to develop the characters and events as well as the book, it changed the characters and situations that it did develop.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
399,freegomallorca,Enjoyed it more than the first movie,9,16 May 2008,"Having seen The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, I went in with pretty low expectations. But I came out quite satisfied. To tell the truth the first movie was more like a fairy tale and less like an adventure. This movie had the looks of a true adventure. Though it lacked the taut screenplay of the first one, it had a better plot. And some of the locales used were really awesome. The cameraman did a better job. There were some funny situations in the movie which the first movie lacked greatly. Battle strategies were more mature and all four Kings and Queens of Narnia looked more convincing in their characters this time around. But honestly speaking I don't know what the Prince Caspian was doing in the movie other than romancing one of the Pevensie sisters.

400,daniel_kuehl1980,A Terrific Disappointment,5,19 May 2008,"If you've never read the novel by C.S. Lewis, you will probably think ""Prince Caspian"" is a terrific movie. However, if you enjoyed reading the book, prepare to be disappointed.The most beastly fault in the movie is the portrayal of several key characters. Peter is made out to be a whining, ego-centric child as opposed to his true character as the High King of Narnia. In the opening scenes, Peter is found fighting other children at a train station in London. You find out that Peter started the fight because he doesn't like being treated like a child, a theme which would continue throughout the movie.Caspian is portrayed as a true adolescent; rebelling against Peter's decisions and seeking personal vendettas including a developing love affair with Queen Susan (what's that all about?). This move did a great job of making Caspian look like a pompous ass.At one point in the movie, Peter decides to attack Miraz's castle against the council of Caspian and others. The plan takes a turn for the worse when Caspian discovers that Miraz killed his father and attempts to assassinate Miraz in his bed chambers. That goes badly, alarms are set off, Narnians retreat leaving several behind. Fingers are pointed at Peter for wanting some glorious victory and back at Caspian for not sticking to the plan. Meanwhile I'm sitting in my seat wondering if I'd missed a chapter or two when I last read the book.The last atrocity I'll discuss is the meaning behind seeing Aslan. Faith and Christianity are profound points in C.S. Lewis's novels, and I'll just say that this movie missed the mark yet again.It would be ridiculous to believe a movie could follow a book to the letter. However, what this movie did to the characters is cinematic murder.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
401,ebknows,Spectacular,10,17 May 2008,"Hello all, I can honestly say I have read reviews from this site for a long time now and always love visiting IMDb and find it very useful for many things. However I have never registered on the site or given a review on this website up to this point.That being said after just having walked out from watching this movie, I absolutely had to write a review. I kind of grew up with reading the books and watched the cartoons when I was a little kid and liked the stories. Though these movies about the Chronicles of Narnia are top quality and bring me back to my childhood.I can say it has a bigger picture to it than the first one. I haven't rated a movie with a 10 like ever at most maybe an 8 or 9, Transformers would probably rate 8 on my list and that was my favorite movie for a long time. Though the movie had all I could want in a movie. Of course some things were a little cheesy but I would expect such a thing from a movie/book where the main characters are children ;).I am not saying any of this to hype of a movie, there is nothing worst about a movie than hype that people build up before they see it, then they go see the movie and it turns out to be horrible in their opinion.I walked in expecting a great Narnia film and I got precisely that. A 10 doesn't mean the movie is perfect, but for what they tried to accomplish which was make the movie directly based off the book then they couldn't have done a better job in my opinion.Anyways, go see the movie!",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

403,mailbrad,Really Boring movie very disappointed,4,20 May 2008,"Wow, was this a boring plot with boring action. During the entire movie i was thinking is something going to happen. And then when story came to together at the very end, i was than thinking... This movie has been done million times, but but way worse. The dialog was very predictable, the fighting scenes were the same as the first. The acting was so so. I definitely wont be watching the next one. I liked and read all the books, but this movie really sucks. I am astonished that the other reviewer gave it great marks, makes me think that somebody from the movie wrote it. On a side note i saw speed racer the same weekend, and there was no comparison. That's probably why i thought Narnia sucked so bad. i Guess bad timing on the release.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
404,crosa-2,Caspian movie is terrible adaptation of original CS Lewis story,1,17 May 2008,"I was completely disappointed with the movie. I've read Prince Caspian numerous times. The movie was terrible. It fundamentally changed many of the important characters. Aslan, the key character of the book, was emasculated. Peter, originally portrayed as true to Aslan throughout the story came across as a spoiled teenager. The scene in which the White Witch is nearly called back was terrible as well. In the book, neither Caspian nor Peter were tempted to bring her back. The invented romance between Caspian and Susan was awful as well. Don't waste the money on the movie. Buy the book, or get the Focus on the Family Radio Theatre version of Prince Caspian (and the rest of the Chronicles of Narnia).",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
405,abetsill,Wow,4,17 May 2008,I think I would have enjoyed this movie so much more if I had not read the book. The movie was nice but nothing like the book. I can only say that I am so so happy that this team is not in charge of doing the Tolkien films.I think that the way that C.S Lewis wrote the story is much more effective. Thinking about just the movie and not comparing it to the movie it is really good. The effects are good and the story runs smoothly. Hopfully I didn't ruin it for anyone - please go see the movie...it was good.,The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
406,anonymousanswers,Basically Nowhere Near the Book's Storyline,1,18 May 2008,"Well, I just saw this last night. Basically, from the previews of the movie I knew I would not like it and knew it had just about nothing to do with the book. I only went because my husband wanted me to. I was right. The thing that made me most mad, was that as usual, Hollywood will NOT make a movie without throwing some sort of sex or romance into it, even if there were NO signs of it in the books. They've got a 26 year old playing a character that is supposed to be about 11-13. Obviously, they've changed him into a character of about 17-19, and had him ""yearning"" for Queen Susan, and of course she kisses him in the end. That's Hollywood for ya. If she had done that in the book, she would have SOOOOO been a ""child molester"", because he's just a little boy in the story. That was just the biggest horrible part. The rest of the movie, well, maybe 10% of it followed the story of the book. The other 90% was totally not there. From what I saw, I'm really quite surprised that they kept the main characters' NAMES the same! This is just really NOT a good one for any of the book's fans to see if they're hoping for a good film version of the book.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
407,sgccoral,"Very good movie, better than the first, definitely catch it in theatres",10,18 May 2008,"I went to watch Prince Caspian on opening day, Friday night. It was an excellent movie. I wasn't a big fan of the book, so I hadn't reread it before I went in to watch, so the movie surprised me in some parts...but they were all very good surprises. Also, there was a very good action scene that was not in the book but appeared in the movie, and I really liked that scene too. Furthermore, the movie imbued the characters with more personality. I love the books, but the characters don't have extremely strong or developed personalities; Lewis gives you just enough detail to visualize. The movie elaborated on Peter's personality, Susan's fighting, and Caspian's motives too.All the visuals were very stunning as well. There's this part where the gryphons come swooping in on the castle, and it was just beautiful. So was the countryside and the beach.Anyway, after I left the theatre, I was in awe. My sister and I immediately went home and looked up the Time article about it. I'm not taken in by many movies, especially contrived ones or overly saccharine ones (as the first movie was apt to do at some points, although not overly so), and this really had few faults for me. Two hours and twenty minutes and you definitely get your money's worth.I hope you all go watch it. It really deserves a great reception.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
408,tubaman2003-1,Screwing up a great story,2,19 May 2008,"Once again Hollywood has taken a classic story from an amazing author and changed it to ""make it better"" but ended up simply making it suck. The whole night raid on the castle, who's stupid idea was that? They spent 45 minutes on this section of the movie when they could have stuck to the original story and things would have turned out much better.Now to be fair, when they did stick to the story, it was really enjoyable because it was original and not the same ol same ol that we get out of Hollywood now days. The characters (for the most part) were pretty close to the book. Overall, I really enjoyed the cinematography and special effects, but you don't need to do the dramatic slow motion shots during every fight scene/every time a weapon is fired.I am still left with the question: Why can't Hollywood simply make a movie based on a book without completely changing things? Especially in the little things, what is the point in changing the small details?",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
409,trinedy-2,What does this movie have to do with the book?,7,19 May 2008,"I'm a big fan of the Chronicles of Narnia books. I WAS a fan of the movies too. The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe was in a word spectacular! I was impressed at how well they stuck to the book and I was greatly looking forward to Prince Caspian. What a disappointment. It's hardly even related to the book. I want to see the BOOKS made into movies. Not a MOVIE based loosely around the books. Don't get me wrong; the movie was very well done. But next time I wouldn't mind seeing a little more of the REAL story. Since when is Caspian that old? And where the heck did the stupid romance between he and Susan come from? There were a few parts that stuck so close to the book that even the dialog was the same.(I enjoyed these parts the most) But on the whole, they strayed from the story greatly. It's understandable that some few things need to be altered for the sake of the screen, but the whole overall story?!?! That's going too far.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
410,bctracy-1,"Terrifically unfaithful to the book, decent CGI",3,22 May 2008,"The director of Shrek has apparently decided to take his penchant for computer generated imagery and move it into live action. While the effects, scenery, and cinematic were excellent and exactly what I had hoped for and expected, the story was not. Unlike The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, which surprised me in how faithful it remained to the original novel, this hack, slashed, and manipulated the story seemingly at random and in ways that did not improve its delivery.The primary purpose seemed to be to make room for two extended battle scenes and a hand to hand fight between Peter and King Miraz, both of which came off as cliché and anticlimactic...""Oh no, how can the good guys possibly survive such impossible odds, there seems to be no way out! Whew, good thing the cavalry made it/he summoned up his deep reserve of strength just in time to win the day""...you get the picture.The acting was quite good, particularly Edmund, for as young as they were, but again--the script was awful. There was hardly any character development in any of the characters, but especially for the more minor but important roles like Professor Cornelius. Instead, these characters seemed to serve as comic relief more than anything else.Luckily, Prince Caspian was, in my opinion, the worst of the series so I don't feel too robbed. That said, had they shortened the fight scenes and added a little more character development, the movie could have been ten times better. Hopefully, the director will realize his mistake, dispose with disturbingly Lucas-esquire desire to flaunt his CGI abilities and work to make the next five movies better. If I recall there isn't another major battle until the final book, so one can only hope that the lack of temptation will do the trick.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
411,macilwen1,"No, no, NO!",2,22 May 2008,"I had such high hopes for this movie...I have always loved Narnia for as long as I can remember, and while Prince Caspian wasn't my favorite one of the books, I still loved the character of Caspian and was looking forward to seeing him, and Reepicheep, and Trumpkin, and all the others...Well. The whole feel of the storyline was messed up. The book is much more gentle -- you get to know so many of the characters so much better. There are three scenes that I particularly miss: Caspian meeting the Bulgey Bears and Patterkin and the centaurs one-by- one as Nikabrik and Trumpkin and Trufflehunter take him through the woods; the first battle (the REAL first battle, not the ridiculous storming-the-castle thing) where Caspian fails miserably...but it's so tragically funny, because of this giant who has a head-cold and fought badly because of it, so he drips tears onto a poor small fox (bad explanation, wonderful piece of writing tho); and the part with Bacchus and Lucy and Susan, where they free this village, and Aslan does a few miracles, and it's just a lovely ""romp"", I believe the book calls it. Three of my favorite parts, left out.Now, what did they put in? Well, for starters, it moved far too quickly in the beginning -- one is supposed to see how miserably Caspian failed on his own before Peter et. al. get there (in the book, this is all read as a flashback. The kids rescue Trumpkin and he explains how he got in that position.), and then the children go off to Aslan's How (taking the bear they killed with them for food, by the way, cause they travel for about three days). They see Aslan one at a time -- Lucy, Edmund, Susan, Peter, Trumpkin (who gets tossed about by Aslan, another great scene). I don't remember a great deal of how the plot goes after that...well, the meeting between Caspian and Peter occurs right when Caspian's discussing the White Witch with the werewolf, the hag, and Nikabrik. Not so. Instead, there's a need for a power battle between Caspian and Peter! And then they go off and talk, blah blah blah, and then they storm Miraz's castle. Seriously??!? OH MY GOODNESS. And Susan shoots Miraz's wife? (By the way, Miraz is excellent. They did him well.)I could go on and on and on...the humor is obviously forced, what is UP with Susan and Caspian, seriously, etc., etc., etc.Suffice to say, if you adore the books, don't watch the movie.Only redeeming quality: the cinematography had some brilliant moments. Battle between Peter and Miraz? Beautiful. Scenes with Aslan? Beautiful. However! That castle scene wasn't done nearly as well...Oh well.At this rate, Voyage of the Dawn Treader will be an epic sea battle.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
412,Idigforeignfilms,An excellent film with a variety of interesting characters,10,8 June 2008,"Much to my pleasant surprise, I actually found this movie to be better than the first. It did a good job at retaining its original magical fantasticness (awkward phrasing, I know), but also telling a different story to give the viewer ..I don't know.. more excitedness..? My facial expressions I'm sure would have been incredibly amusing to see as I watched the film. It kept me on the edge of my seat through pretty much the entire movie.Now for the characters. Lucie, adorable as always and since the first film has developed more of a character. Edmund, as you may remember from the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe as a prepubescent moody young boy trapped in the shadow of his older, more dashing brother as made a complete transformation into a funny, sexy teenager. Susan, who had what I found to be a somewhat forced romance with Prince Caspian, was nonetheless lovely and brilliant. Peter. where to begin? Still handsome and brave, seemed a bit more moody than the first film - and also a bit more effeminate. He seemed jealous of Prince Caspian through and through. Prince Caspian: I cannot stress enough how much every single still of him looked like an advertisement for mens' cologne or ..anything really.. An interesting character. Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian also brought about the entrance of a few new characters like a dwarf, a badger, a chivalrous mouse, and the evil uncle of Prince Caspian himself. There were two characters I could have done without, however. They both appeared in order to summon the White Witch. A cloaked parrot-skeleton and a cloaked dear bear-wolf entered the room out of absolutely nowhere to help Prince Caspian with his..troubles..shall we say.. Anyway, they just started chanting some nonsense and I didn't really think it fitted with everything else.An utterly swell film, Prince Caspian, in my opinion, was the best film of the summer...or spring.. whichever season we are in now. I recommend it very highly and I cannot wait to buy it.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
413,hg1027,Not what I expected,7,28 May 2008,"I'm not going to retell the entire story like most of these posters/amateur movie critics seem to enjoy doing. I was less impressed with the graphics in this than in the original BBC version. Seriously, we have kids being taken to a magical land where anything can happen. The available graphics technology is used primarily for what? A talking mouse. Enchanted did that and it was meant for little kids. I was hoping for graphics a little closer to LOTR/Harry Potter and this was closer to Emperors New Groove. I understand the desire to provide as life like an experience as possible, but by simply skipping the harder parts the movie loses a lot.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
414,eireinnlassie,Lewis would be sick,4,29 May 2008,"I was annoyed, when LOTR came out, at all the people who complained about the differences between the films and the books. In my opinion, Peter Jackson made the changes he did for excellent reasons. However, the changes made to the storyline of ""Prince Caspian"" were for obviously promotional reasons and they really took away from the original.The most annoying part of the film was the silly love story between too-much-eyeliner Susan (why is there eyeliner in Narnia?) and bad-accent Caspian, which was non-existent in the book. There was also the irritating part when the filmmakers decided to (almost) bring the White Witch back, which also was never in the book. It's not like Tilda Swinton won't have a chance to reprise her role; the White Witch returns in ""The Magician's Nephew"" for a substantial portion of the story. Then there were the parts about the battle at Miraz's castle, which never happens. The best part was the filmmakers' version of the transportation back into Narnia, which fulfilled all my expectations about how that journey began.As someone who's been reading the ""Narnia"" series for over twenty years, I was eager to see this film because the first one was pretty good. However, I think the filmmakers made silly choices to try and make an already-dramatic story more exciting and to draw preteens into the theatre, when they would have been better served to stay as true to the novel as the first film did.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
415,tankaiquan,The Best Story Adaptation Ever!,10,30 May 2008,"First off, DO NOT listen to the critics who have rated this sequel poorer than the first film. The film itself is stunning and magical- almost surreal. It is honestly one of the better story to film adaptations ever. Having read the whole Narnia series, i do not feel upset or left out as a fan. This film version of the book has not only done C.S Lewis' writing justice but has also managed to add substance and depth to both the characters and the plot. The acting was top class and was consistent throughout the cast. Further,contrary to critics, Georgie Henley's portrayal of Lucy was perfect in showing her innocence at a young age despite having physically outgrown the role. As a Harry Potter fan too, i found that this film showed the true artistry of Disney and Walten Media. Unlike the Potter film series, this film has managed to capture the true essence of the book and has successfully created movie magic through an excellent screenplay. I found myself just lost in the film and not noticing how closely the dialogue mirrored the book as the film progressed past the 15 minute mark. This is unlike Potter adaptations which i would find myself scrutinising the dialogue between actors throughout the film. Though the Narnia film version took some liberties on the plot, i found that again all the editions did not stick out or seem misplaced just for the sake of easier story flow. Again, plot changes were more noticeable and irksome in the Potter adaptations. Granted that Potter plot lines are far more complex than Narnia ones, i still feel that Walten Media and Disney managed to deliver a more rounded and complete version of the film than Warner Bros were able to with the Potter film adaptations. I know that i would be owning the DVD once it's out. So get out,ignore the critics and give Narnia a chance. You'll find it worthwhile!",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
416,holmesryan,An excellent sequel,10,1 June 2008,"""Prince Caspian"" was an excellent sequel to an amazing movie. Edmund had a more serious role and really made the story for me. It contained a lot of humorous remarks and had some of the best battle scenes i've seen in a while. It had a lot of action and when Aslan come back and Lucy sees him then he roars and all the trees come back to life. When the trees are fighting in the battle at Aslan's How it contained very good animation. Also I liked how the Minotaurs were good in this movie. The mouse was hilarious and without him it wouldn't have been the same with several funny remarks. Ben Barnes was a fine addition to the cast and nailed the role. I look forward to seeing ""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" and is sure to be a knockout.

I love Narnia and was very excited about the movie. It was extremely disappointing. The first film kept fairly well to the book and was at least relatively authentic to C.S. Lewis' characters. Prince Caspian the movie contained little of the book's plot and a great deal of plot apparently made up by the writer of the screen play, who apparently either never read the books or did not understand them. Very bad for those who actually read the Chronicles of Narnia and loved them. Reading the other comments it was obvious that those who really enjoyed the movie had never read the books or were unaware that the movie was based on a series of books written by CS Lewis written in the 1950's, which have been popular children's fiction for several generations.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
418,phohnstadt,A fantastic movie . . . if you never read the book.,2,6 June 2008,"Many of the people that I have talked to about this movie loved it. However, almost everyone I've seen that was amazed by the movie either had never read the book, or hadn't read it in years. Personally, I read the book within a week of seeing the movie, and I was abhorred at how much was altered from the original novel. The first Chronicles of Narnia movie, in my opinion, did a great job of sticking to the true spirit of Lewis' work. The second, however, really dropped the ball. Some changes were minor, and I would be able to ignore them if it weren't for the other huge changes. The restructuring of Caspian's escape, for example, I could deal with (until he blows the horn to escape those that are chasing him, which bugged me a lot). Maybe, just maybe, I could even live with the Caspian-Susan romance that was entirely absent from the book, if they hadn't insisted on changing parts of the plot to fit this development. The fact that Lucy sees the trees dancing during a dream in the movie, as opposed to in real life as it happened in the book, is also excusable. Major changes are what really made me angry though. I won't go through every change, it would take far too long, but there are a few I will touch on. In the book, Peter, Susan, Edward, and Lucy are on the island where they arrive for nearly half of the story. In the movie, they're hardly there at all. In the book, Peter is always on Caspian's side, and helps Caspian prepare for battle and make the decisions Caspian needs to make. In the movie he was entirely different, rising in opposition to Caspian's attempts to hold out in the How, and designing a completely moronic invasion of Miraz's castle. The movie also left out most of what happened with Lucy, Susan, and Aslan at the end of the book. The most ridiculous change was the invasion of Miraz's castle - completely absent in the book. It was entirely unnecessary, and clearly a step over the line as far as sticking to the books plot, showing that the producers are not as concerned as representing the books accurately as they should be.OVERALL: For entertainment value, Prince Caspian is very well done if you can ignore the drastic changes made from the original novel. As far as depicting Lewis's vision however, I feel the producers of this movie did a terrible job. If they wish to make a movie that bears the title of Lewis's extremely successful series, then they should be devoted to presenting Lewis's original vision, not changing the story to try and make it more profitable for themselves. The book Prince Caspian (as well as the rest of the series) is well written enough that the movie could have stuck exactly to the original plot, characterization, and theme and still had a wonderfully successful film on their hands. I can only hope that the upcoming Voyage o0f the Dawn Treader is much more representative of the book on which it is based and of Lewis's original intent.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

I think Andrew Adamson made a pretty good adaptation, because the book would be boring, if being adapted like it is written. But Narnia LWW was much better with the adaptation. The Pevensies were (again) the best characters in this movie. The actors were totally AWESOME!!! (especially Georgie Henley, who played Lucy Pevensie) Those young talents surely have a very bright future! Ben Barnes did disappoint me. He didn't really get the idea of playing his character and his acting isn't as good as William Moseley, Anna Popplewell, Skandar Keynes and Georgie Henley. He just wasn't the right person for Prince Caspian. His weird accent was just totally unnecessary and he seemed very inexpressive for me.The music is something very important and Harry Gregson-Williams did a nice job again. You can listen to the OST CD over and over again and the soundtracks are just beautiful masterpieces.I strongly recommend this movie to every Fantasy-lover.

That doesn't save the film, especially with horrific acting preformed by the title dude, Prince Caspian, who put coal in the audiences stockings, with wooden acting and terrible line delivery. The Pevensie siblings were just so so, the brightest one being Edmond for me, the one I disliked the most was Susan played by Anna Popplewell, who had gotten uglier since the first film, worst of all there was this awkward ""fling"" that went on between her and the prince (will some one give Caspian some glasses?). I know I'm going pretty hard on the film it has some good moments (covered in poop), but you can't ask for much it is the adaptation of the Worst book in the series in my opinion, plus one can't help but notice the Christian Over and Undertones. Hi I'm Jesus!....I mean Aslan. Aslan is certainly Christ inspired, seeing that he likes to not be there, and enjoys chaos before he returns... Aslan died for your...Sins?...Free Will?

422,petra-stahly,Fabulous Movie but Not for Small Children - should be 12 instead of PG,9,30 June 2008,"Fabulous movie! Although I think that the movie took a lot from Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and ""300"", I was very impressed and enjoyed the film experience tremendously. Visual effects, scenery etc. are stunning! well done! Also the acting was good in my eyes. I do pay attention to the details in the fighting scenes as I am learning Tai Chi Sword and therefore very interested( there was a lot of sword drawing in the film!) In addition, I marvel at the perfection gained to display these massive battle scenes with computer graphics - just as in ""300"" and Lord of the R. But - as a middle aged women - who was sitting next to an eleven year old boy and 80% of very young children - age 4, 5 etc..I would say the movie is not rated correctly with the PG label. To me it should be <12>. The boy (age 11) next to me was utterly frustrated to see mainly battle scenes,he had expected more of a fairy tale plot, the little girls kept running to the toilet. Quite bit of violence and scary characters - such as the in the witch scene - must give the little ones night mares.

423,WildHamster235,"The more you think about it, the worse it is",3,13 December 2008,"After seeing this, I don't know what to make of it. I start to think about this movie and it just keeps getting worse and worse every time I think about it. One example is the characters. Most of them are as bland as toast with nothing on it. Caspian seems to be in the film for almost no apparent reason whatsoever (By the time the film was over, it felt like he got the crown for nothing, really). Susan is so bad in this movie, I was glad she wasn't coming back to Narnia (Which makes me feel Narnia 3 will be a much better treat).The timing is also bad. One example is Aslan. I began to lose my patience waiting for Aslan to come back and by the time he did, all I could say to myself was ""what took you so long?"" The other reason the timing is bad is when the bad guy got killed. By the time the climax comes, there's no real bad guy in the film. It's just Narnians fighting against Telmarines because some guy was stupid enough to kill the bad guy off in the name of power.But the one thing I loathed the most was the screen writing itself. The lines are bad from start to finish (They don't even sound Narnian, for crying out loud) and there are moments in the film that are completely unnecessary. Take the scene with the white witch. I don't get why some people liked that moment. It was completely unnecessary and had nothing (Well, almost nothing) to do with the movie. But the screen writing is probably responsible for almost all the things I hated about the movie. That makes the script the worst part of this entire movie.The only good thing in this movie was Edmund. At least you liked him more in this one than you did in the last one. Besides that, he seemed like the smartest guy in the entire film! Unbelievable.What a shame. I hope that Narnia 3 disappoints me a whole lot less than this one did (And hopefully, considering that the crew is expected to be replaced by some other guys, it should be better).",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

The first one is a mixture between Harry Potter and Lord Of The Rings, saw I never thought the second could be possibly better, but it was...A girl who was sitting in front of me in the theater, said to her friends: I loved it, action when there had to be, a good story line and romance when there had to be. I didn't really liked the girl but she did make a good summary. There is something magic about this movie, you get dragged into it and before you know it, 3 hours have passed. The final scene was one of the most romantic kissing scenes I have ever seen, Ben Barnes wasn't he best performer but this scene he did very well, it was especially him who created the chemistry but I still haven't figured out how he did it. I did found it sad knowing that Peter and Susan will never come back, especially Susan while she and Caspian made such a cute couple.

I loved all of the battle scenes and as we all know good always triumphs over evil. My favourite character was Peter as I thought he had the makings of a leader . He proved that he was brave and beat the evil king in the end. The other characters were wicked and I even thought a bit of romance made it slightly better. I hated the queen and all the evil characters. In the end it was really good and I Would actually recommend it for children between the ages of 12-17 because it might be to scary for the younger children.10/10 though - it was better than I thought it would be!!!!!!!!",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
426,Ratiatum,Would have enjoyed it more if hadn't read the book,5,12 July 2008,"It's always a risk seeing films made of a favourite book. The adaptation of the first film took some poetic license but managed to bring to life the book's themes and characters extremely well.If I could judge Prince Caspian on its merits as a film alone I would have enjoyed it as a great piece of entertainment. But it strayed too far from the book for my liking. Peter comes across as a belligerent adolescent with an overly short fuse, and the rivalry between him and Caspian did not enhance the development of either character. The love interest between Susan and Caspian is corny and doesn't benefit the story in any way. I would love to have seen more of Doctor Cornelius, and a more gradual portrayal of Caspian's discovery that the legends of old Narnia were real, and of his self-discovery as heir to the throne of this ancient kingdom (and not just to that of Telmar). We see much more from the point of view of Miraz and his court in the film, which gives an interesting perspective, and the battle scenes are impressive. But these aspects occupy so much of the film that we lose the centrality of Caspian to the story, and the trials which ultimately prepare him for kingship.I loved the CG Trufflehunter and Reepicheep, and the dwarfs are just as you imagine them. The destruction of the bridge of Beruna is an outstanding piece of animation. We see Lucy and Edmund growing up in Caspian (great acting from Keynes and Henley!), and I look forward to seeing them ""come of age"" in Dawntreader. But overall, as much as I was delighted with the first film, I doubt that Caspian will become an addition to my DVD library. It's a great swashbuckler, but too light on character development in my view.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
427,johny151,I am not surprised,6,17 December 2008,"As i was disappointed of first movie so i am disappointed now. I found storyline of this movie a bit shallow with some senseless situations. For example, where the heck was Aslan all the time. Only appeared right on time to save all, with pathetic excuse, that nothing happens twice, or something like that. When narnians broke down the caves right on their own heads? Well, that truly wasn't a great idea in the last battle. I didn't read the books, but this movie is discouraging me to do that. On the other side environments were really nice, actors were doing well and some battles were well made. There was still something happening(I like the conspiracy as well), so at least it wasn't boring. My vote is 6, means only average movie. The other side: I was thinking about the another conspiracy of Doctor Cornelius. He was only a half human, so he wanted his revenge for his people and brought up prince Caspian for his own purposes. He planned Caspian will one day betray his people and help narnians rule the world again. It has to be noticed, that Caspian wanted the throne at all cost, even with aid of the evil witch. So, when Caspian wasn't able to become a king, because of his uncle, he decided to grab the throne with narnians and betray his people. It wasn't so clear as Cornelius wanted to, but it was successful. I believe Cornelius wanted a secret government of narnians, which could manipulate Caspian and rule. And Aslan? As I said, he didn't have a proper explanation, that he didn't show up earlier. He was just thinking, which side to choose regarding of Cornelius actions. So Aslan decided in the very last moment(Lucy's arrival was not a reason, he could act before, if he wanted to), watching all the earlier defeats and suffering. So he is not as good as he looks like, big fluffy conspirator. So he helped Caspian to reach the throne(probably because of death of his favourite Miraz) and Cornelius, as the man behind the curtain, won this time.

The reason why I have gave 7 stars to this movie is because the movie wasn't as good as first in the production matter, I think there were more mistakes in this one than the first one.

Lewis can stand of himself and mending him only spoiled things. and if you want to spoil other stories about Narnia the same way you better think again. people who love lewis want to see lewis in screen and not boring stamps which Hoolywud love so much. use yours brains dear Americans.

I have never been so hurt by a film adaptation of a novel. This is even worse than the recent butchering of Pride and Prejudice.I am not, I think, an unreasonable person. I can perfectly understand that there is no possible way that a book can be perfectly translated onto the screen, cuts must be made, so that we, the viewer don't have to sit through a 50 hour film. What i cannot understand, is why must such drastic cuts going to be made to the story, when the director, writers and production team are then going to add completely irrelevant battle scenes. I mean, I know it's a fantasy, but really! Brain Fart! I know, we're pressed for time, lets make up a 20 minute long random action packed scene, where we can get the stars all sweaty, and show off some of our super cool cgi! And what did they do to Peter? why? WHY? why make him something he never, ever was in the books? why is there such conflict between Peter and Caspian, who was nothing but deferential and willingly led by the High King? completely ignoring the disappointment that is Dr Corneius, the return of the WHite Witch, the destruction of Aslan, the complete misunderstanding of Trmpkin and Reepicheap, the conflict with Miraz.WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT ROMANCE ABOUT? Honestly, how could they do it? Did they think we wouldn't notice what they have done to what so many of us treasure?

If you loved the story of Prince Caspian as much as I did, you will be Disgusted by this pointless piece.The main characters are altered so that I was thinking, ""Is this some sort of satire of C.S.

Just avoid this.So there needs to be more said: Peter is portrayed as a petulant preteen brawler, Caspian is an adult, Susan and Caspian have a romantic thing going, the whole faith lesson about seeing and following Aslan is omitted, there are long drawn out battle scenes that have nothing to do with the story, Lucy and Susan are portrayed as warriors far outdoing Caspian and Peter, etc.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

You're going to be blown away by the impressiveness of Aslan's super-sonic roar-boom. And the musical score when what's-her-face (Phyllis?) kissed that Italian wanna-be was just Wuhan... I'll have it stuck in my head for months. There should have been more cheetahs. I mean, just because they're basically extinct in real life doesn't mean they can't be overpopulating Narnia. I think the density of the cheetah population should have been extreme... Like you couldn't take four steps without stepping on a cheetah. I also really liked Reepacheep. Not as much as my friend, though. She's gonna marry him, even though she has a boyfriend. I don't know how her boyfriend would feel about that - being dumped for a rodent. As for the ginger dwarf... That guy was seriously creeping me out. I would have gotten a restraining order against him for looking at me like that. It was so scary! I really liked the way he twirled his knife around like a baton in his hand as he ran toward the guards on horseback, though. It really showed how experienced he was in the art of war.

The BBC production of these titles were bang on the money, but these Disney productions are such pathetic and false re-tellings of the books it makes me sick! I'm sure that Narnia fans everywhere are thoroughly disappointed with the result of these productions.

434,gemre-1,Well Done and Best Wishes for the Next.,9,17 June 2009,"Fantastically well done.I honestly hadn't expected much from this film. The remake of the first film blew through essential scenes and rushed development of the characters. However, with the second film, the character development can be dropped and the sway of Narnian history can take focus.The film actually produced a more entertaining account than the book itself. You felt the failure of the siege and the dysfunction of a life divided between two worlds. While I wish a more thorough book to film transfer were possible, the Dr. Cornelius ""coming out"" as a narnian would have been especially poignant, I was overall very pleased.Just to recount some thoughts from the watching: - The reversal of humans and orcs was very clever as the Telemarines took over the role of earth defacers from Sauron's legions of LOTR. - Anna Popplewell = Next Angelina Jolie? Years will tell. - The tree opening as a door to the other world, very slick. - Aslan... gorgeous animation. Would love to be that lion's friend. However, the character is flawed... ""Nothing happens the same way twice""...ugh. I wish the writers had put a little more thought into his purpose and goals. He swoops in when Lucy accepts his call? I realize C.S. Lewis didn't do much better but this was a chance to repair a broken chain.Again compared to the last movie, this one was a masterpiece. Hope they can do justice to the Voyage of the Dawn Treader in turn. Good luck!",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
435,gardnersart,Prince Caspian stands by itself,10,19 August 2009,"I just wanted to comment on this movie because it's brought me so much enjoyment and I am so tired of hearing bad reviews about it. Prince Caspian is a remarkable adventure movie that stands by itself. Yes, its not the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe, and it couldn't be. You have children coming back to Narnia with a whole different outlook on life. You have a magical land that lost it's magic because it was invaded. And you have an orphaned Prince that is meant to somehow save Narnia, a land he secretly heard tales about and wanted to believe in. All of these things were very carefully considered in the making of this film and excellently accomplished. Peter who once was a man, and then a boy again, struggles for identity all the time wanting to hear from Aslan but has forgotten how. After a bout of temptation by the White Witch, Jardis, he finally proves himself faithful by offering to sacrifice his life in the battle with Miraz for his brother's and sisters and for the freedom of Narnia. Susan also offers herself a sacrifice by sending Lucy on to find Aslan while she takes on the soldiers alone in the woods. Lucy and Edmund both learn some important lessons about growing up. The five of our heroes in the end forget their personal conflicts to take on their enemy and in so doing find the real value in life, love and friendship. The ending song sums up all that it is about and always brings tears to my eyes. In C.S. Lewis' writings there's a emphasis on the longing for another world that all of us have, and even though that world brings conflict and struggles, the reward is more than we can imagine.I find the movie Prince Caspian an epic example and portrayal of all that the author meant it to be. There is deep philosophical meaning weaving harmoniously through this movie. I watch it over and over again. For those who criticize it harshly I can't help think that they've missed the whole point and I'm sorry for them.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
436,Jordy-Shute,As excellent as the first movie,10,20 October 2009,"I went to see this Prince Caspian with my family and some friends of ours. I was definitely impressed to find that Prince Caspian was just as wonderful as the first film. My family, although they liked it all right, they didn't like it nearly as much as I did, and our friends enjoyed it more than my family did, though not as much as I did. But I was surprised to read all of the negative comments complaining that Prince Caspian was not faithful enough to the book. Douglas Gresham, C.S.Lewis' stepson, who is very committed to being faithful to the books, agreed that there had to make some changes in order to adapt the story to film. He said {in his own words} that they had to amplify things a bit and what works in a book very often won't work on the screen and had to be a faster-moving and in some ways more exciting film than the first. He also said that he thought Lewis would be pleased if he saw the way both films were made.One of the negative comments was that the Pevensies meet up with Caspian much sooner than they do in the book; this was done because it would look odd on the screen if they only met Caspian towards the end of the movie. The reason why Peter and Susan's characters have changed is because of the difficult transition from being the rulers of Narnia to being ordinary children in our world and the effect it had on them. Some people complained that the battles should have been more bloody. This is ridiculous. Prince Caspian is family movie after all. The other idea that the film showed people killing each other, instead of developing character in the main roles, is not true. The film clearly shows all of the different qualities in each person or dwarf or talking beast in every scene in the movie.The romantic relationship between Susan and Caspian is not departing too much from the book, since Adamson and the other filmmakers do not make it one of the main points of the film. And anyways,it is perfectly natural that they should be attracted to each other - their personalities are rather similar in some ways. What would have been terrible is if they had Susan and Caspian MARRY one another. In the books, Susan sometimes doesn't seem to be given as much attention as the Pevensies are given. For example, there is not much indication in the books to show how she was always trying to be grown-up except for the The Last Battle, when she lost interest in Narnia and was only interested in ""nylons, lipstick and invitations"". So it is interesting how hints of these feelings are displayed in the movie. When I got the extended version of Prince Caspian, I enjoyed watching all but two of the deleted scenes {the nursery scene and the part where Glenstorm is explaining about Aslan's How}. The scene where it shows Caspian being surprised by Susan's expert archery skills is a similar scene in the book, except that it happens at Cair Paravel, instead of outside Aslan's How and it is Trumpkin that loses to Susan. It is also interesting that when Susan fires her arrow, a Telmarine spy notices and discovers the Narnians' hideout. The deleted scenes also includes the Bulgy Bear sucking his paw, one of my favourite parts in the book. The reason why Aslan didn't come rushing in to save the Narnians during the castle raid was simply because Aslan tells Lucy in the book that things never happen the same way twice and it has been hard for all of them in Narnia during their first visit.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
437,dforce420,What I Thought about Prince Caspian,5,21 December 2009,"Four children enter a far away land where animals ruled and talked just like humans. But there is a group of people who are getting in the way of Narnia being a peaceful place; they are the invaders. In this story these children will help out the animals to defeat the invaders; these children are kings and queens of Narnia and are greatly honored by the Narnians. The four kids end up helping the Narnians defeat the Telmarines in this epic battle.I thought that the actors fulfilled their role as their characters pretty well. I also liked how they had the actors and the animals interacting with one another. Also the computer graphic designers did a really good job on making the animals look almost real, and when they had the actors riding the animals they made it look pretty real.What I found most interesting was how the made the animals talk and fight just like humans. I never really saw that in a movie before and just found that to be really interesting. Also how they did the choreographing was pretty good too. I also liked where they had the movie take place; they picked a good place to make the movie. All in all I think that is was an alright movie.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

Very long battles scenes, ridiculous dialogue, horrendously bad acting, and holes all over the plot make this practically impossible to enjoy.Most of the time, I have the ability to turn a movie off and watch something else, but I thought I would stick it out because my wife enjoys the series. I looked over at her 20 minutes from the end and she was fast asleep.Thank-you for ruining (what I hear, I don't read much fiction) an incredible book series and what could have been a possibly great, fun, family movie.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

440,fox-eva,"cha-ching, cha-ching",4,18 May 2008,"When I read that Prince Caspian was going to have a darker, more serious tone with better characterization, it got my hopes up. I didn't especially like the first film; not saying I hated it, but it was just, ""meh,"" boring. If that bugged you about the first one as well, be glad to know that they had a bit more fun with this film. Too bad the people adding this ""fun"" don't know a thing about making a good movie! This film was just plain terrible; the pacing was slow the whole way through, the characters didn't seem to have any consistency, people had deus ex machina information dispensation when the ""writers"" (I would call them chimps, but that would be a disservice to Chim-Chim from the wonderfully entertaining Speed Racer) felt it would have a larger emotional impact. The humor is not funny; short jokes are not humorous, especially the 20th time said. So to sum it up, that anchor Adamson made another film where you don't care about anyone or anything going on in it, but in addition to that the movie can't even hold together the entertaining bits. I can't see myself watching another one of these cow-pie Narnia films unless they dump the writers and director, so hopefully those bums get canned and they bring in some real talent.DO NOT PAY TO SEE THIS MOVIE!",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
441,lexx_cat,What I truthfully thought..,3,17 May 2008,"I'll admit when someone asked me to see this movie, I really didn't want to. I had seen the first one, and thought it was an 'Okay' movie, but wasn't as amazing as most people had thought. But I decided I would give it a chance, because the first was good. I was disappointed... The four main kids acting wasn't the best, and wasn't believable. The whole time I was thinking it looks like they're trying to remember the next line. They weren't very together either, when they hugged or showed emotion toward each other, it looked awkward and unwanted. The special F-x were good, I'll admit that. They clearly had a whole load of cash to use on this movie, and used it as much as possible. The sets were amazing as well. The ""Narnians"" looked amazing and so believable, I loved it. When I went to the opening show at 10:30pm, there were 250 seats left. When I assumed people would be lining up for it, but I guess it's mostly a kids show, so they wouldn't bother seeing it at 10:30pm. Overall, this movie had exceeded my expectations in some ways, and disappointed me in others. I don't really recommend seeing this movie, unless your blind of mistakes, bad acting and non-explained story lines. And to be honest with you, I fell asleep through at least 2 to 3 scenes.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
442,kokoba,A solid sequel.,7,17 May 2008,"The film adaptations of _The Chronicles of Narnia_ have, so far, met with mixed reviews. To start off, I'm going to make it clear that I loved the books as a child (and even now), and that I also love (though not unreservedly) the movie interpretations of them.The first review complains about the movie having an hour's worth of material that drags well over the two hour mark. While I agree the movie has some pacing issues, the whole thing doesn't drag. As for the plot being confused, I had no problems with it. While I had re-read the book a few weeks before, the movie presented it very straightforwardly. The Telmarine intrigue is a bit subtle, perhaps, but nothing that a little thinking on behalf of the audience won't clear up.Lots of things were suggested or hinted at in the book but then never really taken up: tensions between Caspian and Peter over leadership roles, enlisting the help of the White Witch, and the realization that everyone they knew and loved from their first trip to Narnia is long dead. All of these were very brilliantly worked into the movie, and I applaud the filmmakers for that. The romantic tension between Susan and Caspian, while not in the book at all, was also well done and not too over the top.My own issues with the movie were relatively minor. First of all, the siege on Miraz's palace was rather unnecessary. It seemed to exist just to drive the point home that Peter can't rule Narnia all by himself, which could have been better accomplished with something more subtle. Related to that, while being High King of Narnia for years and years would probably make Peter a bit full of himself, he seems just a little bit too dick here than would be appropriate for his character.I should mention that Eddie Izzard is an absolute delight as the voice of Reepicheep. Seeing Warwick Davis (of _Willow_ fame) in the role of the black dwarf is also great fun. Fantasy buffs will probably notice small nods to movie precursors like LotR and Krull that pop up now and then like inside jokes.Overall, Caspian was great fun. If you didn't like the first movie, you probably won't like this one either--there are drastic changes to the story, and most of the time people seem to object to that, even when they're for the better (which is possible). But if you liked the first one, then you probably won't be disappointed.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

444,wgarizio,Awful,2,2 March 2021,"My daughter's caregiver put the movie in for her to watch. I would never choose to watch it for the following reasons. It is a terrible rendition of CS Lewis story. The characters in all of these modern versions are so snarky and contentious toward one another. Caspian acts like a petulant teenager, who instead of being in awe of and respectful to the ancient kings & queens, picks fights with Peter every chance he gets. In turn, this rendition of Peter is decidedly unkingly- he acts like a child playing at being grown up, thinking that being rude & bossy is how he is supposed to act. Susan has a perpetually snotty look on her face and is a G.I. Jane wannabe. Her character is supposed to be gracious and stately, and the romance angle is dumb, although it could be a tolerable Hollywoodization if the rest of the movie weren't so bad. The story itself is changed in many ways that don't make sense. I could add so much more but suffice it to say I agree with almost all of the other one & two star reviews and would suggest to everyone that they listen to the focus on the family radio theater versions of these wonderful stories. They are true to the stories and have done delightfully funny dialog.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
445,JaneRochester,Magical and beautifully filmed,8,20 June 2008,"WARNING *SPOILERS*While I enjoyed the first movie, I think that this one was the stronger of the two.""Caspian"" opens with a highly dramatic scene where Caspian is trying to escape from the castle. I enjoyed the drama and tension of the scene. It was very well done.I loved Georgie Henley as Lucy in this. The scene where she encounters Aslan in the forest is magical and beautiful. I thought Peter Dinklage's portrayal of Trumpkin was amazing. He provided not only comic relief but also made Trumpkin more flawed and believable. He also had a great rapport with the Pevensies. Also, Warwick Davis was outstanding as Nikabrik!! Nikabrik is a complicated character and he was able to show the nuances beautifully. I didn't even realize that it was Warwick Davis until the credits! I also liked Ben Barnes quite a bit. Ben Barnes I think did very well in creating an older, braver, Caspian. I liked that Caspian wasn't perfect, that he admitted that he was not ready to take on a kingdom on his own. He was an orphan and a bit sheltered from reality because his uncle hid so many things from him. Reepicheep - adorable and true to the books! He stole the show at many points. I would have liked to have seen more of the animals in general - one key scene was left out.Some complaints: Prof. Cornelius was hardly in the movie at all! He was one of my favorite characters from the book. He was seriously underused. The fact that Caspian's nurse was missing I thought made it necessary for Cornelius's character to be utilized more. I did think that the actor who played him was great in his limited screen time.I felt that the romance between Caspian and Susan was unnecessary and out of place. If they had developed the relationship more and gave the two actors more screen time together, it would make more sense. It felt a bit random.Overall: a visually stunning, well - crafted adaption.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
446,jazzloveselijah,"Good, but not as great as the first",7,27 June 2008,"As a huge fan of the first movie, I went to see this with high expectations. And the film doesn't disappoint, for the most part. The visuals and battle scenes are as stunning as always, the acting was solid from all four children, and from Ben Barnes, and the film will doubtlessly, and deservedly draw comparisons with 'The Lord of the Rings.' Unfortunately, the sub plots of the film let it down. Disney obviously felt the need to shoe horn in a romantic subtext between Susan and Caspian, cumulating in a kiss. Perhaps there could have been a more subtle way to show the way she is growing up. And lost is the Aslan storyline from the original book, where only Susan and Edmund can see him, as they are still young, and this is relegated to a few scenes. The film certainly does well in turning a sprawling, plot less story into a tight and enjoyable film, but unfortunately it just can't quite live up to the brilliance of its predecessor",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
447,tangerinefurball,"Great fantasy movie, but not for young kids.",8,30 May 2008,"So I overcame my misgivings and went and saw Prince Caspian. I'm glad I did. If I had just read a list of all the changes they made compared to the book, I would have assumed I'd hate it, but you know what? It worked. It was pretty great, in fact. Two thumbs up! My reasons to see this movie: 1. Eddie Izzard steals the entire movie as Reepicheep. Well, the voice of, technically. He wasn't on screen nearly enough, but they got him exactly right. Courtly, pompous, selflessly brave, swashbuckling and also tiny and cute. So perfect. I've been a fan of Reep' since the books, but seriously, they nailed it. He should get a spin off TV show or something.2. Anna Popplewell as Susan. First of all, how cute a name is that? Second, somebody (I assume the director) made sure she got lots of time on-screen being an action hero just like the boys. Seriously, she kicks righteous butt Legolas-style on several different occasions. She also had a bit of character development in the form of a not-quite-romance with the hunky twenty-something Prince Caspian (yeah, that's one of those changes I mentioned above) and I didn't hate it. I tensed up in dread when they started down that road, but they used such a light touch that by the end of the movie I was on board. It ended up just being another aspect of the ""Fantasy Kingdom"" motif: magic and talking animals for Lucy; excitement, adventure and respect for the boys; and a real live Prince Charming for Susan. It's just so great to see a role for a teenage girl in fantasy that's a well-rounded, competent, confident character, while still getting a few fairy-tale princess moments for fun.3. The song at the ending was by Regina Spektor. Now, I'm totally biased because I'm a huge fan of hers already, but even so, it's a great song. Somebody has good taste.4. Fantasy Violence is serious business. They really made the violence unpleasantly realistic, for all that it involved centaurs and whatnot. True to the book, it wasn't a children's story so much as a coming-of-age story, and the emotional impact of violence and death was a big part of that. I gather that this is one of the things angering parents who want another Harry Potter, but not treating a war with the gravity it deserves would have been unfair to the source material, and the point of the story.5. Eye candy. I know we've all gotten jaded by the state of the art of special effects -- seamlessly mixing cgi and real elements in the same shot and computer-animated characters that have souls of their own aren't exciting any more, but these people know their business, and the movie was a beautiful visual composition from start to finish.I didn't love everything about this movie. It seemed a little gratuitous for the bad guys to have vaguely Hispanic accents, and I don't agree with all the changes from the book. One thing they didn't change is the religious allegory, the moral of which seems to be ""Make the important decisions based on faith, not on what seems possible,"" which is a little troubling as well. I have to admit that it's very true to the original work, though, and the moral dimension is what gives the struggles of the characters so much weight, so I can't really object.Overall I recommend it for any kids over 10 or so who won't be scared by the violence, and any adults who can still appreciate a good fantasy adventure.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
448,A_Bob,Disappointing,6,18 May 2008,"Last warning for spoilers:After falling in love with ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,"" I was expecting an amazing sequel from the same people. ""Prince Caspian"" was a disappointment, however.The changes made from the book were so many and extreme that Adamson (the director) completely altered the theme of the story. The character of Peter was so changed that one questions what exactly he learned from Narnia that he will not be allowed to return. From the fighting at the beginning of the film in England because he is upset about being young again to the power struggles with Caspian, his title of ""The Magnificent"" was sullied.Caspian fared no better. In making him an adult and Miraz the Lord Regent, they made a crown Prince not even knowledgeable about the fact that the throne is his and that no other Lords who are suspicious of Miraz ever talking to Caspian about his birthright. That is unrealistic. Even worse, they turned Caspian into a vengeful man who jeopardized a mission to attempt to avenge his father's death.What was worse, however, was that Adamson chose action and battle scenes to character development. There were so many characters introduced but none of them were rounded out. It felt as if the characters were background to the action. They did what they did because they were supposed to rather than any meaningful reason due to their personality.As a Narnia book series fan, this was a major disappointment. It really felt like Adamson redid a mediocre medieval war movie adding Narnian characters for effect.Bob",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
449,trixiestomp,Disappointing,2,5 November 2016,"If you have read the book, the movie will be awful. If you have not, you may enjoy it. The movie left out many of the important elements from the story and changed many parts completely. Peter portrayed himself in such a different way in the book from the movie. The importance of the other children not seeing Aslan but still following Lucy the second time around was left out completely from the movie. The entire fight scene in Miraz's castle did not happen in the story and pitted Peter and Caspian against one another, another thing that was not in the original story. We were very disappointed throughout much of the movie. I understand the writers need to appeal to the masses, but the original story by C.S. Lewis would have done that on their own.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

Magnificent movie! The Pevensies come back not only to figure out that their magical land was attacked,but that they will have to fight some intruders. Some sequences are mild violence, but other wise, wonderful. Fun to watch for the whole family. People of all ages watch and love the Chronicles of Narnia series. I hope you enjoy it!",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
451,kovalbhatia,Pretty endearing,8,16 May 2008,"This movie isn't half as charming or eloquently magical as the first, but it engages nonetheless.There's something about the young actors chosen to play the four major roles- Peter, Edmund, Susan and Lucy. They badly make you wish you were in their shoes. The film in itself is often reminiscent of LOTR, but the major difference being in a childlike simplicity this one retains.Aslan, despite not having much of a role, manages to be the most striking character, and Lucy is as lovable as she was in the first film.The battle scenes are brilliant, as are the landscapes. The power politics and senselessness of violence are dealt with a lot maturely in this film as compared to the first installment. At some point you realize you want at least a dozen more films revolving around these four siblings, and to be able to access Narnia for ever.The only thing that ruins this film is this strange invasion of Hollywood-like romance as a very annoying little subplot, and the sudden intrusion of a ridiculous song at a climactic point.Apart from that, I am pretty sure any fantasy-hound would enjoy this film a lot, and especially so if you're a big Lewis fan.I know I am.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
452,crazy_guy_425,Better than the first.,9,20 May 2008,"M'Kay. We're back again, this time for even better fight scenes, better characters (and character development for that matter), and much better animation. The music was endearing, and matched the moods perfectly. The final song (The Call, by Regina Spektor) brought me to tears. One of many new characters, Prince Caspian (played by Ben Barnes) fit in with the other four children as if they'd always been together, as did most secondary characters. One that comes to mind is Reepicheep the mouse, voiced by Eddie Izzard, who stole the show with his antics. In two days, I've seen the movie twice, and will definitely go see it again.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
453,idobelieveinfairies297,"All in All, it's a great movie!",9,20 May 2008,"I enjoyed this film a lot, maybe more than I expected to. I was very excited about Prince Caspian, being a big fan of the books, and even more excited after all the hype and promotion of the movie. So, after seeing it today, I'd have to say overall I really liked it and would love to see it again, as well as buy the DVD. I won't go into a big in-depth review, however I will say I was satisfied with all the actor's performances and I think they can only get better as the movies go on and they gain more experience. The pevensie characters start out pretty stiff acting wise, but I'm happy to say they steadily improved as the movie progressed (or maybe the ""Narnian air"" is what changes the characters, making them a little braver than they are at the beginning ;). Ben Barnes is not just a pretty boy! Is he the exact match of the Caspian I had in mind? No. But, he is still likable and his performance was good enough and went well with the storyline (I don't feel the character is supposed to be completely dashing and valiant, since he still has a lot to learn). I thought Tilda Swinton's small scene was fabulous, one of the best parts of the film. Though not really included in the book, it works in the movie. Actually, there are a few places where the director took some creative license, but don't dwell on it because it helps the movie flow better. Although, as others have mentioned, this is not the same religious allegorical tale as LWW, I feel life lessons can still be taken from the movie and the book, though you'll probably only catch them if you're a little older. One last thing- I really liked the scenery, it was beautiful and I found myself wishing I could be there (wherever it is that they filmed). I would definitely recommend this movie to any Narnia/fantasy fans and I look forward to seeing Voyage of the Dawn Treader in a few years, because it seems these movies can only get better!!",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
454,mdvk,Simply wonderful,10,17 May 2008,"We took our children (8&12) to see Prince Caspian this morning and found it to be as exciting, enchanting and sublime as the first. It has been many years since I read the Chronicles, so I have to be honest and say the color of Caspian's hair wasn't an issue for me. I felt the entire film retained that wonderful balance of drama and comedy and told the story in a beautiful manner. I was actually surprised at how late it was when we left the theater! The CGI characters were amazing. Eddie Izzard was the perfect voice for the smallest of warriors.Well done Walden and Disney! Thank you for starting off the summer season with a family favorite!!",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
455,p_imdb-156,A disappointing and lifeless sequel,3,16 May 2008,"*Note: This was written by user Cornetto on the forum. It is so dead on to me and my wife that I would like to use his exact words.* I reasonably enjoyed 2005's The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch & The Wardrobe. It was nicely shot, with a deliciously evil and seductive villainess in Tilda Swinton's White Queen (Who shows up briefly in Caspian in a scene so awful it must be seen to be believed). She, and Liam Neeson's regal voicing of the Jesus-lion, Aslan, helped overcome some of the bumpy effects and often terrible acting from the four children at the heart of the story. It was like Lord Of The Rings-lite, engaging and amusing... And occasionally even terrific fun.Alas, there is nothing good to say about the new follow-up, the agonizingly dull and lifeless Prince Caspian. This time around, the young heroes Peter (William Moseley), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), Lucy (Georgie Henley) and Susan (Anna Popplewell) find themselves transported back to Narnia, and in direct confrontation with the evil King Miraz (Sergio Castellitto - made to look exactly like Gerard Butler in 300), who aims to wipe the mystical inhabitants of the land off the map. To further aid his plan, he has driven the true heir to the kingdom, the titular Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes) into exile. Soon the children must make an uneasy alliance with the Prince and, with the aid of the magical creatures of the forest, take back Narnia and restore it to its former glory.While in brief synopsis form the storyline of Caspian is far from wretched, the execution is never anything less than woefully inept. Director Andrew Adamson, who helmed the previous film, as well as the first two Shrek outings, shows absolutely zero flair for the material. His shots are lifeless and devoid of energy. As well, Prince Caspian is among the cruddiest looking blockbusters in recent memory. There is a prolonged castle siege that is so muddy and foggy looking that one begins to wonder if someone spilled ink onto the print. Similarly, the sweeping fields and hills of Narnia have no splendour or majesty. They're point-and-shoot travelogue shots.The battle scenes are particularly horrible. It's quite obvious that all of the stars are in desperate need of some extensive swordplay summer schooling, and thus every fight is a hack-and-slash edit job without grace or impact. There is a LOT of swash-buckling here, and not an iota of it looks even slightly competent. It's really pathetic when a major summer film like Narnia can't even provide a half-decent action scene.This brings us to the acting... Or lack thereof. The young leads are hopeless, delivering all their lines in disbelieving monotones. There's no passion or drive, and they seem to care little about the apparently massive stakes of the story. Sadly though, they still manage to blow Ben Barnes right off the screen and back into central casting. I cannot recall a more bland performance by a lead actor in many a moon. This mannequin makes Hayden Christensen's prequel performances look like the work of Orson Welles. Looking like Timothy Olyphant's emo brother, and displaying limited facial mobility, Barnes mumbles his witless lines through a bizarre Greek-sounding accent that seems calculated to irritate. As well, special notice must go to the award-winningly bland villainous turn by Castellitto, who would probably have been better off as Ray Liotta's sword-boy in In The Name Of The King.The script (HA!) for Prince Caspian, by director Adamson, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, makes sure to give each character only a single minor personality trait so as to prevent them all from congealing, in the viewer's mind, into a single mass of slithering blandness. I dare anyone to even attempt to care about a single character here! (The cute sword-slinging mouse not included). And therein lays the problem, for all the tortured (and often incomprehensible) revelations and twists in the plot, there is nothing to care about. Instead of watching a story unfold, we are subjected to simply counting off an endless amount of flat scenes until the underwhelming and plodding conclusion.Honestly, I can't imagine there being a worse major film this summer than Prince Caspian. It is an epic blunder that kills any chance of me paying to see the next chapter, as well as any chance for an even half-decent trilogy. It's cynical audience-manipulating dreck without a single ounce of cleverness or wonder, and among the longest 2.5 hours I've ever spent in a theatre. There are going to be a lot of disappointed and bored families walking out of this clunker, and more than likely a massive number of complaints about the far-over-PG level of violence and scariness. AT one point little Susan declares ""It feels like magic!"" No, Susie, Prince Caspian is where magic goes to die.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
456,defzoix,"Disney drops the ball, again...",2,17 May 2008,"As a huge fan of the chronicles, I was disappointed with the L,W,&W and didn't feel like it captured the book very well. This version of Prince Caspian was much more of a disappointment for me in that it did not follow the book very closely at all. The cinematography, sets and costumes were excellent, but there was no character development. The story was taken out of sequence, when it was followed, and the director took quite a bit of liberty in interpreting and ""improving"" the story. Too bad, since the book stands quite well on it's own. I am very surprised to see such positive reviews posted here and am curious how well it will do here in the states.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
457,florint-55758,Complete garbage,2,26 July 2018,"Two stars for the actors effort to work with the script. Completely shallow, no emotional attachment opportunities, just violence throughout. Definitely not what I consider a ""kids"" movie. The book provides so many opportunities to talk to your kids about life and people, none of that here. Feels like they extracted the action parts from the book, sprinkled a few uninspiring dialogs throughout and focused on the violence of war. So sad.
Hopefully somebody will do a remake someday to do these books justice.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian

I was not amazed in a sense that I cannot say wow. It was totally expected. The scenario was good but I can predict most of the outcomes. I believe that this sequel is great in terms of graphics, cinematography and direction BUT it lacked the creativity or twist. It is for the young and old and I can understand why it ended up like that.It is still a good movie but forgettable. I prefer watching 'Kung Fu Panda.' The actors and actresses were good. Character development was obvious and the setting was gorgeous.

459,monkeysteak-1,Wow is the only word needed.,10,16 May 2008,"I JUST now got home from the theater, and I must say...what an INCREDIBLE ride!All four children have really matured not only in age, but in acting ability. The battle scenes were beautifully executed and the visual effects were outstanding. The book itself definitely had one of the more boring plot lines, but Disney's re-creation had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. Not only did it stay true to Lewis's story, but in my opinion, Disney improved upon it. This film has everything: excellent visual effects, humor, romantic tension, battle scenes (for all you action buffs), bravery, heroism, and strong morals.If the rating scale went up to 10,000, that's what it would be in my book.",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
460,ray_gross33,get over yourselves!!!,9,18 May 2008,"OK, I understand some of you purists are upset about that kiss between Caspian and Susan. I myself am a huge C.S. Lewis fan, but I have the common sense to realize that 1) in any case, the movie is never as good as the book, and 2) ITS A MOVIE... of course Hollywood is gonna throw in a kiss scene. Get over yourselves!!! It's still a good movie- the allegorical references to faith and God are not lost, the cinematography is good, and the acting is pretty fair.It seems that some people (esp people of faith) are always focusing on the negative... do you really think any movie is EXACTLY PERFECT IN DETAIL as the book? When I saw that scene I simply rolled my eyes. Another reviewer said that she ""cried and was angry"". Are you kidding me?All in all, very good movie with good messages. Entertaining and encouraging.watch it",The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian
