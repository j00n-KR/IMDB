0,SnoopyStyle,icon adjacent,8,25 April 2019,"It's 1934. Bonnie Parker helps Clyde Barrow escape a Texas prison work gang. Governor Miriam ""Ma"" Ferguson (Kathy Bates) faces public pressure. Frank Hamer (Kevin Costner) is recruited to be a highwayman with orders to take down the rampaging fugitives. He and his partner Maney Gault (Woody Harrelson) are former Texas Rangers which was disbanded in those more civilized times. The duo tracks the fugitives to their ultimate ambush deaths in Louisiana.Netflix seems to be taking over these medium sized films. This one tackles Bonnie & Clyde but from the other side. It's fascinating that Bonnie & Clyde were and continue to be media sensations. There are countless versions of them on the small screen and the big screen. They are cultural icons. They're basically shorthand for criminal Romeo & Juliet. They are cool and hot. They are the excitement and the romantic. Almost nothing is given to those who hunted and killed them. So it's really fascinating to see these icons with the eyes of their pursuers. Whether it's Costner, the time period, or the criminal icons, this reminds me of a harsher and less glossy The Untouchables. Bonnie & Clyde are more like side characters. They are the shark in Jaws. This paints a heroic weary picture of Hamer and Gault. These are old gunslingers from the Ole West. The truth is a little muddier. The ambush is interesting which does something more than the usual. The production is pretty good although I was concerned about authenticity at the beginning. It is closer than most Hollywood production. These are great characters. Costner and Harrelson are well within their elements. This is an engaging movie as a companion piece to the countless Bonnie & Clyde movies.",The Highwaymen
1,Prismark10,The over the hill cops,5,8 April 2019,The Highwaymen is based on true facts but felt too fictionalised to me.Frank Hamer (Kevin Costner) and Manny Gault (Woody Harrelson) are two former Texas Rangers put out to grass by Governor Ma Ferguson (Kathy Bates) who disbanded them for being out of control.Now they have been brought back to active service to apprehend Bonnie and Clyde. The common people seem to treat them like folk heroes. To Hamer they are evil criminals who have killed 10 lawmen and 3 civilians.Hamer and Gault come across as two grumpy old men on the road. Gault feels guilty about their shared dark past. Director John Lee Hancock sets an image of rural America gripped with economic hardship and bank foreclosures. You can see why Bonnie and Clyde would be seen as two people trying to buck the system.The film is sluggish and really slows down in the middle. Hamer seems to have crime detecting abilities that shows up the new fangled FBI as clueless.The film cleverly deglamourises Bonnie and Clyde. We hardly see their faces and they do not have much dialogue.,The Highwaymen
2,nogodnomasters,Outlaws always go home,9,21 April 2019,"The film starts in Eastham, Texas 1934 with a prison break. Bonnie and Clyde are on the loose and the police are helpless to stop them. Only former Texas Rangers Frank Hamer (Kevin Costner) and Maney Gault (Woody Harrelson) can stop them...in Frank's wife's 85HP Ford with suicide doors that needs oil.This is the story of the hunt for the outlaws from the law enforcement point of view. Frank shows no mercy and takes no prisons. He is the type of guy that says, ""Hands up"" after the outlaws are dead.Entertaining story even with Costner playing a straight man for his side kick. They are the over-the-hill gang that uses their brains and out thinks the younger guys.",The Highwaymen
3,kosmasp,Sympathy for the devils (?),9,10 August 2019,"I'm not sure if I've ever seen Bonnie and Clyde from the 60s, but that aside the morality of it or rather the depiction of the title characters there is supposed to be rather sympathetic. Again don't nail me on what the movie does with it, have to really watch it, especially after seeing this. Because no matter what the other movie did, this is portraying the whole thing from another perspective - the law enforcement that went after them.And this does not care about mysticism or romanticizing what happened. While we stay mostly away from Bonnie and Clyde, what we see of them or rather the mayhem they leave behind is not anything any sane person would declare as good.A strange yet very enganging movie, with a great lead performance by Kevin Costner.",The Highwaymen
4,classicsoncall,"""People don't always know who they are..., until it's too late.""",8,16 June 2020,"This film probably won't achieve the iconic status of the 1967 feature ""Bonnie and Clyde"", but it's still a pretty good picture, taking an approach that almost leaves the infamous criminals out of the story, except to make them the object of a Western manhunt. What's striking in the story is how Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow were afforded the same notoriety and hero worship as outlaw Jesse James, all of whom took on a Robin Hood like persona by robbing from institutions that took advantage of their era's poverty. Kevin Costner and Woody Harrelson are effective as the newly reunited, and formerly retired Texas Rangers, recruited by the Texas governor's office to track down the murderous duo. Criss-crossing a handful of states, Frank Hamer (Costner) and Maney Gault (Harrelson) use their experience and knowledge of criminal behavior to eventually track their quarry to a country road in Louisiana. I did a quick sit up and take notice when the former Rangers drove their way over a bridge crossing from Texas into Oklahoma, with Maney remarking to his partner, ""It's open range now"", offering a nod to Costner's well regarded Western of the same name from 2003. Though the story is set in the 1930's, I couldn't help making a comparison to a couple of modern day pictures that deal with good guys and bad guys at a time that deals with the passing of an old guard and the ushering of the new. Similar themes are prevalent in the 2007 movie ""No Country for Old Men"", and the more recent ""Hell or High Water"" from 2016.",The Highwaymen
5,lee_eisenberg,the hunt is on,7,1 April 2019,"No doubt most cinephiles have heard of Bonnie and Clyde thanks to Arthur Penn's 1967 movie starring Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway.* But now we have a different look at the story. The Netflix movie ""The Highwaymen"" tells the story of the Texas Rangers who spent several weeks hunting down the duo. Kevin Costner and Woody Harrelson put their all into the roles of the men whose single goal is finding the criminals. There are all sorts of characters with whom they come in contact in the process, but they won't stop.It's an impressive movie. I will say that Ma Ferguson (Kathy Bates) wasn't sufficiently developed, but since she wasn't the focus, it probably doesn't matter. This is a look at its subject that you never imagined. Definitely worth seeing.*There was another movie about them: ""The Bonnie Parker Story"" in 1959, starring Dorothy Provine (Emmeline in ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"") in the title role.",The Highwaymen
6,CinemaSerf,Just a bit on the dry side....,6,13 May 2020,"This struck me very much as a labour of love; clearly a subject that was of huge interest to Kevin Costner and director John Lee Hancock. As such, there is a superb attention to the detail, chronology and - from what I have previously read about Bonnie & Clyde - a serious attempt to keep the truth and authenticity of the story front and centre. Governor ""Ma Ferguson"" (Kathy Bates) calls up two retired Rangers to chase down the popular, but havoc-causing robbers. The film follows their meticulous efforts in ruthlessly and cleverly fulfilling their task and - unfortunately - therein lay the problem for me. It is too detailed; the pace, though interesting in parts, is way too slow. There is a great deal of dialogue - and not a great deal of action. Woody Harrelson works with with Costner; whom I have never quite forgiven for his ""Robin Hood"" performance, and the almost adulatory way in which the general public treated this pair of brutal robbers is reflected spookily well towards the end. Certainly worth a watch, but maybe just a bit too docu-drama style for me.",The Highwaymen
7,zardoz-13,"The Flip Side of ""Bonnie & Clyde""",8,8 April 2019,"""Blind Side"" director John Lee Hancock's authentic, Depression Era, road-trip, manhunt thriller ""The Highwaymen,"" co-starring Oscar-winning actor Kevin Costner and Oscar-nominated Woody Harrelson, serves as the flip side of the classic Warner Brothers' gangster epic ""Bonnie & Clyde"" (1967), with Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty. Told from the perspective of the two seasoned manhunters who tracked down the bloodthirsty young Texas couple, ""The Highwaymen"" confines their quarry Bonnie & Clyde to the periphery of the mayhem, out-of-the-limelight, depicting them in either far-off shots or close-ups, so audiences cannot sympathize with these trigger-happy desperados who had gunned down policemen without a qualm. ""Young Guns"" scenarist John Fusco has provided far more history about this pugnacious pair in this Netflix movie than its celebrated theatrical predecessor. Often, when we see Bonnie, we are given only glimpses of her feet encased in ruby red shoes. She walks with a limp that she acquired after Clyde drove off a bridge under construction when he missed a detour. This mishap injured Bonnie so severely that she resorted to laudanum, a concoction of opium and alcohol, to relieve the agony until she died in May 1934 in a hail of gunfire from two former Texas Rangers--Frank Hamer and Manny Gault--along with a posse in Bienville Parish, Louisiana. Throughout this chronicle of their pursuit, Hamer and Gault were amazed by the relative lack of height of the two criminals in comparison to the media attention that transformed them into titanic celebrities during what was termed 'the Public Enemy era' between 1931 and 1934. In the final scene, Hancock gives us a lingering glance of the two felons, looking like two clean-scrubbed, fashionably attired cherubs, with an arsenal of firearms at their fingertips.As depicted in ""The Highwaymen,"" the beginning of the end for the notorious duo started with a prison breakout that Bonnie & Clyde orchestrated to free accomplices from the Texas-based Eastham Prison Farm in 1934. Warden Lee Simmons (John Carroll Lynch of ""Shutter Island"") of the Texas Department of Corrections got the green light from Governor Miriam ""Ma"" Ferguson (Kathy Bates of ""Primary Colors"") to hire Hamer to stop the crime spree of these two twentysomething renegades. Privately, Ferguson had nothing but contempt for the Texas Rangers, recently disbanded under a cloud of corruption, and warned her own duly appointed constabulary that they would face repercussions if the two former Rangers nabbed Bonnie & Clyde. Frank Hamer (Kevin Costner of ""Dances with Wolves"") comes out of retirement and accepts Simmons' offer despite the misgivings of his socialite wife. Hamer chooses an old friend and former Texas Ranger Benjamin Maney Gault (Woody Harrelson of ""Natural Born Killers"") to accompany him. Neither Hamer nor Gault is in good enough shape to chase a teenager around the block near Bonnie's mother's house. Hamer hasn't fired his revolver in such a long time that he cannot obliterate bottles with bullets. While immaculately dressed officers of the state of Texas as well as the FBI rely on the latest modern crime-fighting technology to pursue the elusive Bonnie & Clyde, Hamer counts on his frontier savvy about human nature and maps charting the couple's whereabouts to ferret them out. Comparatively, this evokes memories of the turn-of-the-century John Wayne western ""Big Jake"" (1971) where Wayne tracked down the dastards who kidnapped his grandson, while law enforcement handicapped by modern technology could do little despite their apparent advantages over him. Ultimately, Hamer and Gault put everybody, including FBI with their aerial searches, to shame. Essentially, our heroes qualify as underdogs who manage to triumph despite incredible odds to stop the Barrow gang.Mind you, ""The Highwaymen"" certainly isn't the most exciting manhunt melodrama. At times, the going is mighty slow because Hamer and Gault painstakingly gather clues and develop leads based on their bloodhound instincts. Although most of the action involves Hamer and Gault, they have few encounters with Bonnie & Clyde until the finale. The scene that highlights best what our heroes must contend with occurs when they tail Bonnie & Clyde out of a town and then lose them in the middle of nowhere. Clyde careens off the highway into a barren field and swerves in circles around Hamer and Gault. Clyde churns up a blinding dust storm and loses the two Texas Rangers. Eventually, after he learns that the felons are cruising off for 'greener pastures,' Hamer decides to pursue them into Louisiana where the authorities have issued no warrants for their arrest. During the manhunt, Gault agonizes about his ability to shoot a woman. Later, they learn Bonnie Parker has been as just as cold-blooded and homicidal as Clyde. This is a far cry from the vintage Warner Brothers movie. Hamer follows a lead involving one of Clyde's accomplices in Louisiana. He cuts a deal with the father of one of Clyde's cronies that culminates in the inevitable ambush of the twosome. The posse catch Bonnie & Clyde as they approach their accomplice's father who is seeking roadside assistance. Reportedly, in real life, the posse poured so many volleys of gunfire into the couple that the barrage deafened them.Clocking in at two hours and twelve minutes, ""The Highwaymen"" aims for the older demographic that loved ""Unforgiven."" Nevertheless, it ranks far above anything that Costner has made in many moons. Costner and Harrelson lend their considerable gravitas to Hancock's authentic looking film. The $49-million production does a commendable job of recreating the utter despair and destitution suffered by too many people during the Great Depression. Some critics and historians have accused Hamer of overstepping his authority after he shadowed Bonnie & Clyde into Louisiana, and he could have taken them alive. Hancock and Fusco show that Hamer was prepared to do whatever was necessary to kill the couple. Despite its impressive adherence to history, ""The Highwaymen"" will always lay in the shadow of the Oscar-winning Warner Brothers' classic, but it does provide greater insight into Bonnie & Clyde.",The Highwaymen
8,ferguson-6,the other side,6,29 March 2019,"Greetings again from the darkness. Setting one's film up to be compared to a long time classic can be quite challenging for a filmmaker, but that's precisely the situation director John Lee Hancock finds himself. Known for crowd-pleasers like THE FOUNDER, SAVING MR BANKS, and THE BLIND SIDE, Mr. Hancock delivers a Netflix film destined to face off against Arthur Penn's 1967 classic BONNIE AND CLYDE. Where the earlier film focused on the anti-hero celebrity (and beautiful faces) of the young outlaws, this latest film flips the lens and puts law enforcement (particularly grizzled veterans) front and center (Bonnie and Clyde are barely glimpsed until near the end).The film begins with a well-planned and deadly prison break in 1934 and then moves into a meeting where Lee Simmons (John Carroll Lynch) of the Department of Corrections is pitching Texas Governor ""Ma"" Ferguson (Kathy Bates) on his idea of reactivating the defunct Texas Rangers, and bringing legendary lawman Frank Hamer out of retirement. It's pretty simple - the FBI and its new-fangled forensics is failing miserably in tracking down Bonnie and Clyde, and the hope is that Hamer and his old-fashioned detective work will succeed.Kevin Costner plays Frank Hamer, and we first see him and his well-trained pet pig trying to enjoy a peaceful retirement at home with his wife Gladys (Kim Dickens). Not long after, he's joined by his old partner Maney Gault (Woody Harrelson), who is down on his luck, drinks too much, and is in desperate need of a purpose. Thus begins the buddy road trip featuring the no-nonsense Hamer and the quipster Gault. Not many play self-importance better than Costner, and few deliver wisecracks better than Woody.The screenplay comes from John Fusco, whose previous western projects include HIDALGO and YOUNG GUNS. Though this isn't a traditional western, it has most of the expected elements. Aging lawmen chasing colorful outlaws. Good versus evil. Right versus Wrong. While it's a relief the film doesn't romanticize the Barrow gang and their violent ways, it's a bit frustrating to see that the movie tries to make Hamer and Gault as famous and iconic as the outlaws they were chasing. Sure Bonnie's fashion influenced many women of the era, but that had to be nauseating for those lawmen in pursuit who were putting their lives on the line. In the 1967 film, Denver Pyle played Frank Hamer in a shamefully written role, and here Costner strikes so many hero poses and seems to invoke mystical ESP abilities in his police work, that we half expect Hamer to walk on water at some point.The best part of the film is watching Costner and Harrelson work together, with the latter really making this work on whatever level it does. Additionally, there is a scene with Hamer and Clyde's dad that features William Sadler in a cameo. I don't know if this meeting actually took place in real life, but it teases what the film could have been. As a fantasy for cinema aficionados, the project was originally intended to be a vehicle for Robert Redford and Paul Newman, but just never progressed. Combine that with BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID and THE STING, and you'd have an unmatched triumvirate of buddy greatness. Hancock's film certainly pales in comparison to the 1967 film, but it's a worthy story that deserves to be told.",The Highwaymen
9,bombersflyup,"Watchable, nothing more.",5,31 March 2019,"The Highwaymen is just an okay film, it's engaging but lacks grit and heart.Costner's solid in the lead, but it's kind of waste to never have the perspectives of Bonnie & Clyde. It shows how they're viewed by the public at the time and that Bonnie was a fashion icon, but other than that it doesn't offer anything new.",The Highwaymen
10,Wuchakk,Tracking down Bonnie & Clyde,8,13 April 2019,"Based on the real story, two renowned retired Texas Rangers (Kevin Costner & Woody Harrelson) are commissioned to track down and execute Bonnie & Clyde in 1934 after other authorities have failed.""The Highwaymen"" (1983) is a great counterbalance to the 1967 movie with Beatty & Dunaway, which painted the thugs more sympathetically, as well as the excellent ""Bonnie & Clyde: The True Story"" (1992).The filmmakers shoot for realism rather than the thrills of, say, James Bond or Batman. And by ""realism"" I don't mean exact historical accuracy; movies never are for many reasons. For instance, Frank Hamer never approached Bonnie & Clyde from the front of their vehicle. Hamer & co. just blew them to smithereens as soon as it was determined it was the rogue couple.The picture is a reverent period piece about life in the Great Depression and the pursuit & execution of the infamous duo by a couple of aged, but experienced men. The film has the confidence to take its time, unlike say ""Aquaman,"" which anxiously jumped to a wild action scene just when a dramatic part was getting interesting. If ""The Highwaymen"" is sometimes slow & boring it's because the actual pursuit was also slow and often boring. This is not a flick for people with ADHD who demand an explosion every 5-7 minutes. It's for people who favor period pieces like ""The Whole Wide World,"" ""Cross Creek,"" ""Of Mice and Men,"" ""The Cider House Rules,"" ""The Green Mile"" and ""Water for Elephants.""The movie runs 2 hours, 12 minutes.GRADE: B+/A-",The Highwaymen
11,trashgang,chemistry between Costner and Harrelson,8,18 June 2020,"Complete different take on teh Bonny and Clyde saga. This time not on the gangsters view but on the view of the two retired Texas Rangers.All based on true stories of course this is a slow builder. Here and there you will see a crime of Bonny and Clyde shooting police officers but overal it's about the two legends.The chemistty between the two main leads work, Costner and Harrelson, worked out fine.If you think this is an action flick you are wrong, it's all happening towards the end, we all know what happened in real life. The credits at the end are worth watchinh because the actors names are shown with the original photo of who they played.I liked it very much, but over two hours it isn't an easy one to sit through if you think it's going to be flashy and full of shoot-outs.Gore 1/5

12,siderite,A two man show,7,1 January 2020,"There is a pattern here: the movie with old actors that were famous once, showing the world that they still got it in a story about old people that still got it. As such, the film is spot on. Both Costner and Harrelson are great, the sets are nice and well done, the supporting actors do a good job. But there isn't much else. The Bonnie and Clyde angle is intentionally left in the background and the things you could learn about police investigations and man hunts are not really that relevant or many. If you remove the production and acting values of the film, the rest is a flimsy story that brings nothing new.Bottom line: completely predictable, both in plot and quality. I was hoping for, but not expecting any more.",The Highwaymen
13,Robert_duder,An Interesting take on history,8,27 April 2019,"The Highwaymen is well directed and well acted and gives a unique perspective on the Bonnie and Clyde story. It does nothing to romanticize the killer couple but still shows how they were romanticized by many. It also creates two solid main characters both portrayed with effortless expertise by Kevin Costner and Woody Harrelson. They have really good chemistry together and both play their ages well. This is an ideal role for someone like Costner who is up there in years but still has the charisma to take on a leading role. Despite most of the film being the search for the couple, it keeps it interesting and doesn't hold back any punches in the ""made for TV"" department. It's definitely R-Rated for a number of reasons. I really like that the director chose not to really show Bonnie and Clyde until the end so it built them up as these great nemesis to Costner and Harrelson until the very end and their end is brutally portrayed. Another very strong entry from Netflix and a great watch especially for Costner fans. 8.5/10",The Highwaymen
14,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Requires your patience, but is mostly successful",7,2 April 2019,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningDepression era 1930s, the American Mid-West. Bonnie and Clyde's trail of robbery and murder is dominating the headlines, and has authorities in a grip of fear, whilst the public, suffering through terrible economic hardship, holds them in a state of awed reverence. Under pressure to bring their crime-spree to an end, State Governor Ma Ferguson (Kathy Bates) enlists the services of Frank Hamer (Kevin Costner) and Maney Gault (Woody Harrelson), two old-school lawmen with an unconventional approach to delivering justice. As their partnership reactivates, old demons from the men's past must be confronted.Kevin Costner has always had a place featuring in true life crime dramas, in fact it's a field he made his name in (aside from one of Dreams!) In his younger days, he was dynamic most notably in Brian De Palma's classic The Untouchables, followed several years later by his sprawling three hour drama delving into the murder of JFK. Now, an older, more hard bitten Costner with more chiselled features headlines this depiction of the operation to bring down Bonnie and Clyde. Director John Lee Hancock certainly has no intention of delivering a more romanticized version of their events, of the sort that featured Warren Beatty, instead delivering an unflinching portrayal of the true extent of their ruthlessness, brutality and mendacity.The first half rolls by on a moody, lingering air, like that of an old western, with only Costner's gruff, grumbling old hack lawman persona really carrying anything. At the start of a film lasting more than two hours, this requires a bit of patience, of the sort a younger Netflix crowd may not have in droves. And indeed, it's him and his partnership with Harrelson's fellow lawman that truly fuels the dynamics of it all, his enforcer a hard line cop with a firm view of right and wrong, at odds with Harrelson's cohort, who thinks things aren't always so black and white. It's very much about their quest to bring them down, and not really about Bonnie and Clyde themselves at all, with the pair of them kept far in the background and only featuring during their crime scenes, with the only dialogue spoken by Bonnie, coldly taunting one of her victims before blowing him away.The most incredible depiction of the film is in revealing just how crippling the Depression of the 1930s was in rural America, with ordinary working people suffering terribly as a result of the actions of those far away from them, that these characters would come to be held in such Godlike regard, in spite of the barbarity and cruelty of their crimes. Uncomfortable parallels can certainly be drawn with the present day in this film that demands a bit of your patience, but pays off in a pleasingly satisfactory way in the end. ***",The Highwaymen
15,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,6,9 April 2019,"The HighwaymenRobbing banks during the depression was easy because everyone was wearing a bankruptcy barrel.Thankfully, the bandits in this drama made themselves easily identifiable by wearing normal clothing.As Bonnie and Clyde continue their crime spree across the mid-west, the Texas Governor (Kathy Bates) reinstates retired Texas Ranger Frank Hamer (Kevin Costner) to capture the star-crossed killers. Armed with an arsenal and partnered with ex-Ranger Maney Gault (Woody Harrelson), Hamer heads to the couple's hometown in hopes their kinfolk will rat them out.While there's no shortage of movies told from the twosome's point of view, this middling Netflix retelling is told from the law's perspective, which is more clinical in its assessment of the pair than most. The real highlight, however, is its frightening portrayal of the folk-heroes crazed fan base.Nevertheless, proponents of gender equality will be glad to know Bonnie was shot as many times as Clyde.

17,tabuno,"A Somber, Solid Crime Thriller about the Hunt for Bonnie and Clyde",8,8 April 2019,"Kevin Costner and Woody Harrelson star in this serious crime thriller about the hunt for Bonnie and Clyde, the notorious crime couple who along with their gang robbed banks, killing police officers during The Depression of the thirties. This thriller focuses on the lives of two former Texas Rangers, Frank Hamer and B.M. ""Maney"" Gault who endeavor to take Bonnie and Clyde down. With amazing shots of the flat landscapes of middle America, Texas, and Louisiana and the rural poverty and dilapidation of the Depression, this relatively low-key non-action oriented and deliberately under-dramatized version of Bonnie and Clyde is somber and strangely riveting for its unorthodox portrayal of crime fighting unlike the typical, mainstream popularized crime action movie, even Costner's own starring role in The Untouchables (1987).

19,eddie_baggins,A dull and uninspired event,4,7 April 2019,"You wouldn't think you'd say it, not when the film your referring to stars Kevin Costner and Woody Harrelson and is based around the true life story of the how criminal superstars Bonnie and Clyde were brought to justice after years on the run, but John Lee Hancock's The Highwaymen is often downright boring.A new Netflix production that's been highly promoted on the streaming service, Highwaymen on paper seems like a sure fire hit with the teaming up of long time Hollywood players Costner and Harrelson a great combo, director John Lee Hancock has runs on the board as a filmmaker with the likes of The Founder and The Blind Side, while a different look at the Bonnie and Clyde story that sees the focus shifted to the aging Texas Rangers that finally bought about an end to their rampage seems like a great way to tell this story but things only ever feel half-baked in this $50 million dollar production.Struggling to keep things moving through the rough start and stagnating middle-section, that features such important scenes as Costner's coming out of retirement Frank Hamer starring across a lake or smoking cigarettes, Hancock never quite nails the tension or thrills that would've been evident on the tail of such notorious figures, while curiously Costner and Harrelson as Hamer's long time offsider Maney Gault don't ever really click, not particularly the actors fault as what they have to work with thanks to screenwriter John Fusco isn't exactly world-class material.For such a high-profile streaming release and a film with a significant budget, it's a shame much of the potential is dwindled away scene by scene as our eyelids grow heavy waiting for a big moment to come, but its few and far between as the only thrills we get are through the well-staged Bonnie and Clyde scenes that expertly keep their profiles hidden adding to a mystic and terror that showcases these criminals as not some type of Robin Hood heroes, but genuine cold blooded killers with nothing but murder and self-gain on their minds.The other issue with this slow moving and often ponderous exercise is you can't help but escape the feeling things feels a little bit cheap and nasty.Sets feel amateurish, the wardrobe feels like it was borrowed from the leftovers of a TV show, while the films big chase scenes and gunfights all come and go with little pizzazz, it's never a good thing when the most exciting sequence in your film is Kevin Costner chasing a weird orange haired man-child or Woody Harrelson attacking a bunch of men in a bathroom, but that's exactly the type of problem Highwaymen faces.These type of problems should never have existed in a film in this space or with the talent involved, but sadly it's the case and becomes yet another example of Netflix's failures to turn potential into outcomes in the feature film department.Final Say -Thanks to being a true story there's still some good to be found here and it's always nice to see Costner and Harrelson in lead roles but overall The Highwaymen remains a rather lifeless, dull and tiresome telling of events that were the polar opposite.

Much of the movie is them driving cross country trying to pick up their scent; with a fragrance of blood. Shown completely through the eyes of the two men, Bonnie and Clyde are only shown from afar until their demise. Crazy to think those two were actually thought of as rock stars and some people loved them. There was ample character depth built in to the officers from their relationship; past and present.

30,peterp-450-298716,Excellent acting but it tends to get boring in this slow burner.,6,7 May 2019,"Bonnie and Clyde have been on the road for two years.
Cold-blooded killers who are more adored than movie stars.
This has to stop.Who doesn't know Bonnie and Clyde? In 1930, this pre-war couple had nothing better to do than go down the path of crime and leave a trail of death and destruction in the US. This young couple was hunted by the police for two years. Until they were killed in an ambush where their escape car was riddled with thousands of bullets (so they claimed). Their victims were mainly banks and gas stations. And among the murdered victims were also a few police officers. This all took place during the turbulent 1930s when the economic crisis hit hard and many led a poor life. Perhaps that's why both criminals were seen as heroes. Their outlaw life looked like an adventure after being romanticized. It appealed to everyone's imagination. And because they wanted to hit the established order financially, they were worshiped like true pop idols. Their story took on mythical proportions. But who knows the authorities who put an end to this duo and their criminal life? And that's what this film focuses on. The arm of the law from that time who, as old-fashioned bounty hunters, going after this gang.If this were the umpteenth Bonnie & Clyde film (a whole series has already been made with the most famous one with Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway) I would have skipped it. But the fact that the story is looked at from a different angle and also that Kevin Costner and (especially) Woody Harrelson play the two Texas Rangers here, made it obvious I had to watch this film. Man, it's always a pleasure to see an actor like Harrelson at work. Even though it's a deadly serious role this time, he always manages to make me smile. However, things don't get crackling in this film. But that is not due to the interpreters of the two main roles. The lack of action in this film (with the exception of a well-portrayed dusty pursuit and the ultimate ambush of course) will be a letdown for many.The fact that Bonnie and Clyde barely enter the picture and the motive to become such a murderous couple isn't explored in depth, may also be a disappointment for many. I think this was a conscious choice by director John Lee Hancock. He wanted to concentrate fully on the two Rangers who are chasing B&C. This way it felt as if nothing really happens during large parts of the film. For the most part, you'll just witness dialogues between the two retired Rangers. They look like two washed up troublemakers who went too far as Texas Rangers in the past. From the outset, you have the impression that these were out of control cowboys who hold the motto ""First shoot and then ask"" as of paramount importance. Not that you get to see anything. You can only conclude this from what is being said by the hastily convened committee of dignitaries who are reasonably fed up with the violent life of B&C. And the anecdotes those two veterans tell sporadically.So it isn't really action-packed and highly entertaining. In addition, you already know in advance how it will end. So you won't be nibbling your fingernails to the skin because of the tension. However, if you are an avid fan of the 30s and the whole atmosphere that exuded that era, then you will enjoy watching this. The film perfectly portrays this era. The vintage cars from that time and clothing. But especially the spirit of these days is constantly palpable. In those years, the industrial revolution and technical progress was ready to explode. It was a time where social life was average and easy. But also the less pleasant side from that period (due to the recession) is shown in a brilliant way. The poor, impoverished neighborhoods and camps scattered here and there were characteristic of that time.What remains is the acting of our two Texas Rangers. It goes without saying that the acting is of a high standard. What else did you expect from such star actors? If there's one thing I enjoyed the most while watching this movie, it's the interaction between them. The one is more grumpy and bitter than the other. And Woody struggles again with persistent alcohol addiction (just like in ""The glass castle""). These two seasoned Rangers provide the necessary vibrancy and entertainment. But unfortunately, this is not enough to take the boring and slow ""The Highwaymen"" to a higher level. Daily life was perhaps nerve-racking and exciting to Bonnie & Clyde. And I can imagine they led a restless life while fleeing from one place to another. As energetic as their life was, so boring it was for their pursuers. And that trend continued in this film. Are you naturally impatient or you are in the midst of a period that requires a lot of energy so that you are constantly fighting fatigue? Well, then this film is definitely not recommended.More reviews here: movie-freak.be",The Highwaymen
31,dierregi,Non-glorified gangsters don't rule this movie,7,4 August 2020,"I am usually not a fan of movies that glorify gangsters, especially real life ones who were brutal killers, but I know that in the States, during the economic turmoil of the Thirties, tabloids run all sorts of lurid stories glorifying criminals like Bonnie and Clyde and Dillinger.Even today, some people consider these criminals as 'rebels"" against an unjust society. We can debate endlessly about the fault of modern society, but murder in cold-blood and robberies are hardly a solution to fix problems.Therefore I was very pleased with this movie that tells the no-frills story of rangers Hamer and Gault, two expert veterans who get down to the business of finding the criminals and getting them - better dead than alive. Costner and Harrelson are very good as the unlikely duo of bad cop/good cop. The first being a silent, decisive type, the other a more talkative, sociable guy, but neither of them falling for the misplaced hype surrounding the Parker/Barrow criminal gang.We get to see the criminals only in brief glimpses, which is the same perspective the detectives would have had and it helps not to develop much empathy when they meet their demise .",The Highwaymen
32,TheFearmakers,"The Overrated Bunny and Clod Has Been Replaced, Finally",9,8 December 2019,"Arthur Penn's BONNIE AND CLYDE hasn't really aged all that well. Still entertaining, and reinstating Depression-set gangster films during the counter-culture, it's said to have borrowed the style of French New Wave... But all the phony-looking back-projected driving scenes resemble b-pictures from the time of the couple's reign.Well this isn't a review of that movie but a much better and more realistic one: THE HIGHWAYAMEN centers on the guy who took down that famous Depression-era bank-robbing couple, and Kevin Costner's Frank Hamer, unlike Denver Pyle in 1967, isn't an inept, vengeful dolt. How the former UNTOUCHABLES star portrays Hamer, you couldn't imagine him captured and humiliated by Warren Beatty's beanpole Barrow. Even the couple look more like they actually did...Until the familiar bullet-riddled climax, the short, pig-eyed punk and his frail, rabbit-faced dame are only shown in wide shots or are darkened closer up, almost like we're purposefully not seeing the anti-Beatty/Faye Dunaway actors on purpose. Or perhaps because it's not their ride...With Woody Harrelson as Hamer's more meek and talkative yet frail and bankrupt former partner Maney Gault... who in real life probably wasn't a sarcastic comic relief to Hamer like Harrelson does so naturally... most of the screen time has the veteran Texas Rangers riding long stretches of dusty-gray highway during an often brooding, reposeful journey, recalling the first season of TRUE DETECTIVE...But without curse words every second or tons of bloodshed catered to the post-Tarantino generation, it's an antique-green-coated, rural-widescreen, old fashion take on an old fashion story where the violence is built into the violent legend of these two men...Who were part of the Wild West's final-final days, and had their own reputation albeit nothing close to the white trash crooks they dogged: Only those in law enforcement really knew or cared of the daring exploits of the lawmen while the media played-up the criminal-killers as intrepid victims of circumstance (nothing much has changed), even publishing Bonnie's childish poetry as if she were a celebrity contributor... which in a way, she was... Because of the media!The best scenes involve whenever Costner's Hamer really concentrates on the investigation process after the ""I'm too old for this"" mantra wares out, juxtaposed by the usual pretentiously idiotic ""Feds"" with twice the manpower and technical abilities. One fantastic monologue has Costner's Hamer telling his own backstory to Clyde's father (a desperately sad William Sadler), which in itself could have developed into yet another movie altogether....And while Hamer and Gault: The Early Years would be great, it's the weathered, experienced, craggy-faced performances of Costner and Harrelson that really makes this tick, and one can't imagine CGI-facelifts like Martin Scorsese's abysmal THE IRISHMAN, also a Netflix Original but with ten times the budget and promotion. In comparison, THE HIGHWAYMEN, although literally/intentionally driving in circles, has an actual destination while hardly ever losing focus.",The Highwaymen

34,AudioFileZ,"Excellent ""Other Story"" of The Bonnie & Clyde Saga",8,30 March 2019,"Apparently the story of Bonnie & Clyde is so ingrained in American Folklore it is still viable for movie makers. It will probably continue to do so up to its centennial and beyond. There is a lot to work from. There's a time in America our current generation can hardly imagine could exist. There's the unusual fact that a woman turned into a violent killer as deadly as her mate. And it's a doomed love story which may be now as then the real hook.At least if we get another telling of B&C's story it's good to get another perspective making it fresh. We get that here with two retired lawmen coming out of retirement to track down the Barrow gang and eliminate B&C. Thankfully its a story worth telling and is done simple and well. Kevin Costner, reminiscent of his Elliott Ness roll with plenty more miles rises up to play a humble determined ex-Texas Ranger. It is interesting that the Texas Rangers were once dissolved because it was felt they dispensed law without impunity on their own black and white terms. Anyway his pairing with a former partner, played by Woody Harrellson, who didn't quite fair as well transitioning out of being a Ranger is a good twist plus its true to the actual story. This is a good story too. It shows the disjointed different law enforcement agencies scrambling to save face yet still not cooperating for the good of simply catching the criminal. Interesting this was still causing problems leading to 9-11. Anyway we get two determined lawmen whose sense of right and need to do what they do best one last time really works.I highly recommend The Highwaymen. It is very well done with a pretty good period recreation (there's a few faux pas if you take it to the mat but nothing too glaring). The cinematography is often striking in more than a few scene setups. And the story is 100% absent of Hollywood bombast. It's a great melding of a lot of real and gritty things, a little humor, and a story worth being paid homage to. This is one of those rare films I watched twice almost back to back which means it's better than good as far as I'm concerned.",The Highwaymen

37,PimpinAinttEasy,American filmakers have forgotten their roots,4,30 March 2019,Watched it. So disappointing. American filmmakers have forgotten that films need to be fun. This film was the opposite of fun. Too many dark discussions about killing. Uninteresting anecdotes rendered in a dull tone by uninspired actors. That same dark doomy music (what happened to some good old country music?). This was a $50 million production. They should have got MORRICONE to do the music. There is too much of a COEN BROTHERS vibe and not in a good way. It was about two old guys hunting down two criminals. A straightforward idea that should have created a rip roaring road movie thriller/western like TRUE GRIT or THE GETAWAY. But even the procedural aspects of hunting down Bonnie and Clyde were pretty boring. Apparently this was supposed to be a PAUL NEWMAN- ROBERT REDFORD collaboration. COSTNER and WOODY do a good job. But the script and direction/treatment are full of uninspired nonsense. I guess i'll have to wait for THE IRISHMAN now.

38,inspectors71,Promises are Hard Things to Keep,4,28 May 2019,"Watching the trailer for The Highwaymen on Netflix was the high point of the movie. It looked so promising. The trailer showed a crisp, gutty ""bug hunt"" with Kevin Costner and Woody Harrelson paunching and grizzling their way across the Depression-flattened Texas landscape in search of a highway gang led by two people Costner's character later describes as ""no longer human.""And when the film was done rolling for what seemed like 127 minute-and-a-half minutes, and the credits had crept, and my butt hurt, and my eyes stung from the toothpicks holding the lids up, I was mightily annoyed by John Lee Hancock's inability to do chest-compressions on his movie to keep it alive.The Highwaymen is a very significant disappointment because, when you pack that much star-power with the splendid East Texan skies, and you re-tell the can't-help-but-be-compelling story of Bonnie and Clyde, you had better make sure that the viewers are compelled.

42,one9eighty,There was a time when we put a pair of man killers on the trail and let them do their job. TEXAS RANGERS.,7,17 March 2021,"Distributed by Netflix this 2019 Casey Silver produced film is a period crime drama set in the 1930's which tells the story of two former Texas Rangers who are hired to track down the notorious criminals Bonnie & Clyde. Stuck in development hell for nearly 15 years, what was originally going to be a Universal Pictures film nearly did not get made until Netflix bought the project in 2018.Its 1934 and America is in 'the great depression'. Bonnie & Clyde have been on the run for two years, in which time they have broke some of their gang out of prison, and they have continued a spree of violence. Begrudgingly, former Texas Ranger Frank Hamer (Kevin Costner) is brought out of retirement to help authorities, and he seduces his former colleague Benjamin Maney Gault (Woody Harrelson) to the cause too. Using all the old tricks from their past, and learning some new tricks along the way, the senior rangers hunt for Bonnie Parker (Emily Brobst) and Clyde Barrow (Edward Bossert) to bring them to justice, or to give America freedom from their heinous crimes.Having seen different variations of the Bonnie and Clyde story, including the 1967 ""Bonnie and Clyde"" film, I expected this film to feature the notorious criminals more than it did. I was surprised but delighted that instead of just focusing on them, this film followed two of the lawmen that were trying to track them down. It was refreshing to see the story from the other side rather than glorifying the criminals like previous films and TV series have.Costner and Harrelson perform well as the former Texas Rangers. With the star power that the pair have it would be easy not to believe in their characters, but they feel authentic in the roles and deliver them with credibility.The cinematography on display is superb. The construction of the landscape and scenery is done well and looks gorgeous. At times, the sweat and the dirt in the scenes seems to ooze out of the screen and into the pores of the audience. There are apparently some historical inaccuracies compared to what has been written about the events being shown, but not enough for it to become a work of fiction. It treads the path of fact carefully, to the point that the director tried to work close to the actual Bonnie & Clyde trail as he could -filming in the same locations (or as close as possible) to where real crimes occurred.The pace of the film has been criticized in some of the reviews I have read. While it was not the quickest film, I did not personally have a problem with it. I think the film needed to be a slow burner to build up the story and the chase. The law seems to be two steps behind all the time, and there is a noticeable shift in the last act of the film where the law has for once got ahead of the criminals. To me, the pace of the film was reminiscent of some of the crime biopics of the 1980's and 1990's. It felt like the same kind of pacing as other films I have seen Costner in, like ""The Untouchables"" (1987), like ""JFK"" (1991). Perhaps the audience that did not enjoy the pace would have preferred something with more action in, and therefore a film from the lawman's side of the chase might not be the best choice.I enjoyed the film. I thought it was beautifully crafted and brought to life well by those in front of and behind the camera. It was entertaining to watch, and having seen previous versions of Bonnie & Clyde, I learned something new here, instead of just been romanticized by their folklore exploits of robbing the rich and giving to the poor. Some films are all-ages and can be watched by everyone, I would put this film in the grown-up film category and suggest it needs maturity and patience to enjoy it. It's a film that feels old fashioned, not just because to the 1930's period it depicts, but also in the way that this 2019 film unfolds. Real acting, simple story, basic plot with no rush and no CGI to get the audience to the end. Refreshing.",The Highwaymen

50,MrDHWong,An intriguing film that is often brought down by its frustratingly slow pace,6,11 April 2019,"The Highwaymen is a crime film directed by John Lee Hancock (The Founder, Saving Mr. Banks, The Blind Side) based on the capture of criminals Bonnie and Clyde. Starring Kevin Costner and Woody Harrelson, it is an intriguing film that is often brought down by its frustratingly slow pace.In 1934, the infamous criminal duo Bonnie and Clyde have successfully managed to elude the law throughout various American states for the past two years. After the duo assist in a prison breakout in Texas, Governor Ma Ferguson (Kathy Bates) decides to call ranger Frank Hamer (Kevin Costner) out of retirement to capture the two outlaws dead or alive. With assistance from his former partner Benjamin Maney Gault (Woody Harrelson), Hamer is able to closely follow behind thanks to some insider information from the FBI as well as testimony from the pair's family and friends.Even though the subject matter makes for great cinema, The Highwaymen unfortunately feels bogged down by its tedious pacing and mediocre screenplay. Mainly during the second act, the film drags on for what seems like forever, with an occasional interesting glimpse into the backstories of those involved in Bonnie and Clyde's capture. The audience is shown that despite the frequently glamorised reputation Bonnie and Clyde have achieved, they were still murderous criminals who killed and had others killed that attempted to stop them during their crime sprees. Both Kevin Costner and Woody Harrelson have solid chemistry with one another but it's a shame the script does not give the two much memorable dialogue to work with.

52,Alexander_Blanchett,Dynamic on-screen duo,7,7 April 2019,"Tolerable but a bit overlong cat hunts mouse story with a very dynamic on screen duo that should have been on screen before. Kevin Costner and Woody Harrelson share a fantastic on screen chemistry and it s a lot of fun to watch them doing their thing. Both are in my opinion also very ideally casted in their respective roles. Performance wise Costner even tops Harrelson here although you can say that both are doing equally good. The film had an interesting story, showing us the ""Bonnie & Clyde"" scenario out of another perspective which was interesting. The film itself could have been shorter for at least 20 - 30 minutes in my opinion. But it is nicely shot. John Lee Hancock was maybe not the ideal director but technically It was great with a fantastic score by Thomas Newman and great cinematography by John Schwartzman. The supporting cast was fine too. Glad to see Kathy Bates in a prominent role again and also John Caroll Lynch was very good.
Fine story, good actors and an interesting story. Not flawless but surely worth to see.",The Highwaymen

55,FilmFlaneur,A great duo in pursuit of a bad pair,7,2 April 2019,"In this latest Netflix offering, a paunchy Kevin Costner and a grizzled Woody Harrelson (the latter after a previous investigative two-hander in True Detective) play a couple of reinstated Texas Rangers at first doubtful as to their effectiveness away from their heyday, brought to hunt down Bonnie & Clyde and end a murderous rampage out of control. Unlike previous tellings of the these events, we see only glimpses of the criminals up until the final shootout, leaving the film concentrating on the changing, and often deprecating, relationship between old lawmen buddies: whether their time on the road, scornful of new developments in police procedures, or in hunting Bonnie & Clyde down. Fortunately the pairing is, as one might expect, a good one, with Costner and Harrelson enjoying a suitably world-weary rapport, renewing respect for each other, which makes any general longeurs incidental. Director John Lee Hancock, whose previous two efforts were Saving Mr Banks and The Founder, builds the period atmosphere and there's a good soundtrack by Thomas Newman. The overall story and its denouement maybe well known (certainly the climactic scenes can't quite escape the shadow of Arthur Penn's seminal work of decades back) but this is a fresh approach, the end result enjoyable.",The Highwaymen

59,FrenchEddieFelson,Yes!,8,29 March 2019,"We all saw the movie Bonnie and Clyde (1967) directed by Arthur Penn. In France, we all heard the eponymous song (Brigitte Bardot and Serge Gainsbourg, 1968). The Highwaymen is a mirror version with two retired Rangers in pursuit of the infamous outlaws Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker, considered as Robin Hood and his beloved wife by the plebs. A dead or alive hunt, in the 30's. Knowing that dead is a priori more practical, we suspect from the outset, even if we do not know the story, that it will probably be the chosen solution. In many aspects, I perceive the atmosphere of Unforgiven (1992) directed by Clint Eastwood, with its predictable and ineluctable ending, with cars and heavy machine guns instead of horses and Remingtons.The actors, the photography, the costumes, the cars, the atmosphere of the post-1929 Great Depression, the rhythm, the dialogues, the soundtrack, ...

61,PyroSikTh,There Are Worse Ways to Spend Your Time,7,2 April 2019,"The story of Bonnie and Clyde is a well-known one, told and retold time and time again. A young couple on the run leaving a violent wake behind them, but idolised by the population for their stick-it-to-the-man attitudes at a time when most could barely afford to eat. The Highwaymen takes this story and flips it on it's head, instead focussing on the two Texas Rangers who tracked them down and ultimately stopped their reign; Frank Hamer and Maney Gault.Rather than being an action-packed movie as is usually befitting for a Bonnie and Clyde story, The Highwaymen instead decides to keep its focus on the more mundane. We're immersed into an impoverished world, taking the time to soak in the difficult times of the great depression, and honing in on how our main characters adjust to such a world. It's a slow hunt, picking up clues as and when they appear, following hunches across the country. Run-ins are few and far between and are over quickly until the film's climax.But there's more to The Highwaymen than the simple Bonnie and Clyde chase. Keeping the focus solely on the two main characters, and avoiding Bonnie and Clyde as much as possible (we only ever see their feet or silhouettes until the very end), lends to a number of interesting themes that are just as relevant today as they were back then. The most immediate that stuck out to me was that of a world developing too fast. Both Hamer and Gault are well beyond their prime. Times have changed, and both men find themselves working in a world that has overtaken them. They're mocked by the young upstarts and their superior technology, they're shocked by the brutality enacted by two kids, and each of them has their own demons they're haunted by. In a way The Highwaymen feels a little like No Country for Old Men. Our introduction to Hamer is out in his garden by the river, with the peace and quiet interrupted by the bridge of busy traffic nearby, and Gault is routinely surprised by how hunting criminals has been modernised, from wire-taps to forensics.Another symptom of this new world these two old men find themselves in is that of celebrity. Bonnie and Clyde are adored by the local populations, hailed as modern day Robin Hoods, robbing the banks that screw over the poor. Both Hamer and Gault are appalled and confused by how everyone around them can celebrate violent murderers as if they're world-renowned movie stars. The couple are recognised in a small town, and their car is swamped by fans within seconds, a gas station clerk refuses to give any details because he thinks they stick up for the little man, and Gault has to carefully test the waters of local officials to make sure they're not crooked. The most poignant moment of the film is when Hamer is talking to Clyde's father, and the father fully acknowledges the evils his son has committed, but desperately wants Hamer to know he wasn't always like it.The writing is by far the film's strongest point though, as lacking in subtlety as it is. Everything else sits squarely in the realm of good enough. The acting has its moments, especially the aforementioned conversation between Costner's Hamer and William Sadler's Henry Barrow, and the pairing of Costner and Harrelson as grizzled veterans definitely has its moments of charm. On the whole though, the character work and subsequent acting performances are fairly average, neither worth praising nor criticising. Which is fine.Same can be said of the cinematography and musical score, as neither are particularly worth noting one way or the other. John Schwartzman does a good job of ensuring that Bonnie and Clyde are almost always concealed one way or another, whether it's having the camera track across the ground to follow their feet, close-ups from inside the car as if peering through the window from the outside, or placing Bonnie squarely in front of the sun so her face is cast in shadow. But beyond that the cinematography keeps things fairly vanilla and safe. The music by Thomas Newman uses a lot of more traditional sounding themes and instruments, putting the audience right in the depths of the 1930s southern states, riffing on country and folk music blended with more typically orchestral arrangements. But again it doesn't particularly try anything new or stand-out much from other similar scores.In all there are worse ways to spend your time than watching The Highwaymen. It is not a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination. It's competently made, very well-written, and Costner and Harrelson carry the movie as well as you'd expect them to by this point. But there's nothing particularly revolutionary about it beyond it's perspective on a tired story. Telling the tale of Bonnie and Clyde from the perspective of the men who put an end to them is one that has surprisingly never been done, and it's executed very well, making sure not to glorify the couple in anyway. Don't expect it to linger long in your consciousness though. I give The Highwaymen a respectable 7/10 - Good, but nothing special.",The Highwaymen

64,akcenat,Decent crime-drama,7,19 September 2019,"""The Highwaymen"" tries to tell the story of 'Bonnie & Clyde' through the eyes of the retired Texas Rangers who ended up killing them. Unfortunately, as a lot of movies with Costner in it, film was slow paced and way too long. In a surprisingly unsentimental performance, Costner lacks the excitement and spirit that would make the film much more engaging. On other hand, at least both Harrelson and Costner share a genuine chemistry. At the end, it feels like the footage of the 'death car' and scenes of crowd ogling the 'Bonnie & Clyde' automobile are far more effective than anything else that preceded it. Though it is a decent movie, nothing about it begs to be watched on the big screen.

66,stevenrotherforth,Netflix are on a roll. Yet another good movie offering.,7,3 April 2019,"The HighwaymenIt seems Netflix are on a bit of a role as of late.
Yet another decent movie offering to grace their streaming service.
The Highwaymen is based on true events that depict the apprehension of Bonnie and Clyde back in the 1930's by two former Texas Rangers played by Woody Harrelson and Kevin Costner.
Well I say apprehension but as you will witness the catching of the two infamous outlaws ended in a violent bloodbath.
This film focuses on the two rangers.
They're the unsung heroes that stopped the nations most notorious criminals who at the time where wrongly idolised by many.This film works mainly down to the two leads who have a wonderful and believable chemistry.
It's a film that doesn't devote time to the outlaws, instead it allows the audience to get to know Frank Hamer (Costner) and Maney Gault (Harrelson).
The Highwaymen is a slowly driven piece. Dialogue is prominent with action set pieces scattered throughout the movies runtime.
Production is of a high quality. This film is believable and beautifully crafted.
From set design to props and costumes every scene is supremely authentic.
The vintage automobiles sparkle as if they rolled off the factory floor only yesterday.
Director John Lee Hancock has helmed a film with masterful precision.
I was truly immersed and transported back to the 1930's.Presented in 4K HDR this film looks splendid.
With barely any film grain this movie has a crisp clean image packed with detail.
A particular car chase shows good use of High Dynamic Range. The yellow spare wheel on Clydes car almost pops out of the screen.
Detail on buildings and woodwork is very crisp.
Green moss can be seen growing up fences and grass is vibrant.
The texture of clothing is finely rendered and the wrinkles on the two lead actors face are more than prominent.
Ultra High Definition does aging stars no favours.
This is a great looking movie. Very rarely do black levels lose detail. Even in dark scenes the screen is still packed with visual information.The sound mix on the other hand is something of a mixed bag.
Dolby Atmos is sometimes impressive. Height channels are subtle but wildlife and weather can be heard frequently up top.
It's disappointing then that the prominent dialogue sometimes gets muddled and lost.
Costner and Harrelson's drawl is often unfathomable.
Sad as their constant bickering and banter is one of the movie's highlights.
Action set pieces are handled efficiently. Bass response does what's needed. Gunfire being deep and punchy.
In terms of musical score, there's nothing here to write home about however Thomas Newman has provided an effective soundtrack to accompany the onscreen drama.Highwaymen is a good time in front of the TV.
A film that could have benefited from a big screen theatrical release.
However if Netflix continue to churn out such quality I hope this doesn't harm
the cinema going experience.

This movie really stands out in that regard, which I think is part of the reason why it has received such good ratings so far. It just tells the story. And it really immerses you. The sets of 1930's America are beautifully designed and every scene looks like an old photograph come to life, the clothing, the streets, the buildings, the cars, the people themselves.
The story also does not glorify Bonnie and Clyde, but portraits them as what they really are. Insane, psychopathic animals that need to be put down.

75,DeBBss,A Good Depiction of Historical Events,7,6 April 2019,"Netflix has been pumping out a lot of Netflix originals lately; most of them are low-budget movies, or stupid TV-Shows. I think it's refreshing for them to make a realistic portrayal of real events. In my opinion, Netflix's best movies are the dramas and realistic ones. I think Netflix should start focusing more on realistic movies; even though it might cost more.The Highwaymen is based off of real events that happened in the 1930s. The movie shows how two Texas Rangers, Frank Hamer and Maney Gault took out Bonnie and Clyde during their killing spree. I like how the movie focuses also on the great depression, and shows how tough it was to live during that era. What I think is most impressive though, is how well they replicated everything and how they told this story so realistically.The movie does such a great job at making Bonnie and Clyde hateable. Too many movies do a terrible job at creating antagonists. There are few scenes in the movie where we get to see Bonnie and Clyde, all of those few scenes depict Bonnie and Clyde doing inhuman things. When we only see antagonists doing horrible things, and being quite anonymous, we tend to hate the character more. The Highwaymen uses that technique, and uses it perfectly.One issue I have with the movie is how we barely get to know our main characters. Yes, there are scenes where we get to know their history, but there so few scenes of that. One of the most memorable scenes is when Maney Gault explains Frank Hamer's past. That monologue was executed perfectly, but I just wish there was one for Maney Gault himself. It's actually quite ironic that we get to know more about Bonnie and Clyde the most, even though we barely see them.I liked John Lee Hancock's directing. There was some shots that were so memorable, like when Frank Hamer was on the hood of the car, while Maney Gault was below. The cinematography perfected the looks of the 30s; many landscape shots that focuses on the sky.The Highwaymen is definitely worth a watch. It depicts American history at an A+ level, and it keeps you hooked for the inevitable climax.",The Highwaymen

77,ginocox-206-336968,A bit slow,5,31 March 2019,"The Highwaymen (2019) has a documentary feel, but it isn't a docudrama. It has elements of a road trip, but isn't an allegory for self-discovery, maturation or coming of age. It has elements of a buddy picture, but the relationship between Frank Hamer (Kevin Costner) and Manny Gault (Woody Harrelson) doesn't seem to go anywhere. There are elements of a police procedural with underpinnings of political intrigue involving Governor Ma Ferguson (Kathy Bates) and family dramas, but they aren't really part of the through line.Antagonists Clyde Barrow (Edward Bossert) and Bonnie Parker (Emily Brobst) are seen sporadically, but generally in long shots or tight shots that do not show their faces. In Bonnie and Clyde (1967), the characters are played by charismatic Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway, glamourized and presented as complex sympathetic individuals. Bonnie memorably declared, ""We rob banks."" They aren't seen robbing any banks in The Highwaymen, but they do kill several policemen. Their celebrity is viewed derisively by Hamer and Gault, who also disabuse their image as contemporary Robin Hoods, robbing from the hated banks responsible for so many foreclosures during the Depression. They're contemptible and have lost their humanity, their souls, and their right to due process.The film is well made, with excellent performances and production values. The settings, costumes, vehicles and props all seem authentic. Yet, it seems a bit slow. At 139 minutes, it is a bit longer than it needed to be. There isn't much suspense, as we know how the story will end and none of the subplots are particularly intriguing.Part of the sluggishness may be due to the filmmakers indulging in the currently popular conceit of inserting political statements. Basically, a female Democratic governor tries to shore up her political career by giving two former members of the then disbanded Texas Rangers license to assassinate two notorious criminals who have become a political liability, but intimates she will disavow any knowledge of their activities if they are captured, killed or become a political liability. These two habitually exceed their authority, by tracking Bonnie and Clyde across nine states, and interfering with the investigation led by the FBI - at one point barging into a crime scene, trampling over tracks and superimposing fingerprints on a spent cartridge. But what do they care? Bonnie and Clyde will never stand trial. They're out to assassinate them.This is all ultra-rightwing material, and antithetical to prevailing Hollywood politics, which puts the filmmakers in an existential quandary, which they attempt to ameliorate by inserting scenes with underlying liberal themes. We see lingering shots of encampments of homeless families, victims of income disparity aggravated by unregulated financial institutions, and an extended scene where Hamer purchases nearly as many weapons and as much ammunition as Stephen Paddock, including fully-automatic rifles, without displaying any law-enforcement credentials or applying for a permit. When the shopkeeper asks why he needs all those weapons, he dodges the question. Talk about Chekhov's guns! He only uses a couple of the firearms. The audience doesn't need to know how he bought them or why he needs cases of ammunition and multiple magazines, for an ambush that was over before any of the six in the posse had time to reload.These sophomoric political statements bog down an otherwise polished film that meanders aimlessly toward a known conclusion.",The Highwaymen

The outcome is unoriginal and flat. The audience is led through one of the most boring pursuits ever. Some scenes are laughable, such as the one set in the dusty desert. Costner and Harrelson are quite silly in the shoes of retired men. Throughout the movie, they have several exchanges intended to add some emotion, humanity and depth, but irritatingly fail.Production is good, I mean settings, costumes, cars, casting and photography.

This movie is extremely well put together, perfect casting, great cinematography and the costumes just adds value to story which correlates with a lot of old Western flicks. The two actors have great chemistry as these two men who are disconnected with the current times and are using tactics to find the notorious couple. The tempo is slow at the beginning, but it slowly picks up until the finale. The camera helps us follow the perspective of Pancho and Manny where we see how they are trying to find patterns in order to establish a hunting party. The two actors have been casted perfectly as they work magic with their banter and deep conversations about their haunted pasts. The interplay of both actors just absorbs you to watch the screen whether it be holding Tommy Guns or just constant banter, where we have Costner playing an old-school stoic figure and Harrelson comes in as optimistic character with comic relief. Both play each other as a Ying to their Yang. It would've been great if we saw more of Bonnie and Clyde in order to be familiar with their story, understand their trauma and it seems the couple were popular in the likes of the Kardashians.

Day by day their fame in the media also increases and they become celebrity- like figures. After many attempts by the police to capture the pair, the law gets desperate and will try anything. A retired Texas Ranger, Frank, is approached and hired to do whatever it takes to kill Bonnie & Clyde once and for all-kill, not capture. Frank (Kevin Costner) picks up another Texas Ranger, Maney (Woody Harrelson), whom he used to partner with back in the day. Frank and Maney will travel from town to town looking for clues, trying to find those who may know Bonnie & Clyde's next move.As a story, I feel this is a good plot to put on the big screen. When the police fail to capture and kill, the world has no choice but to recruit the men with experience in both investigations and survival. I loved the setup of this film. Straight away this film highlighted the lead characters' skills and qualifications earned from their past.While at 1st glance I loved the casting here and the film's introduction, sadly our leads don't have much chemistry on screen. This was disappointing, considering how much both actors Kevin Costner and Woody Harrelson are in the film. Our two leads play characters who have apparently worked together for many years, but given what they display in this film, I struggled to believe in this ""strong friendship"". Both men appear to be more cranky and over it rather than supportive with one another or a tight partnership.As far as the pace goes, The Highwaymen does unfortunately drag from time to time. There are many moments which don't actually affect the story and I'm surprised certain scenes were left in the final cut. Our leads also go back and forth between the same characters or cities which makes the film feel like it's never getting close to the end. I'll be honest- I did check the film's remaining runtime twice and was surprised how much duration I had left considering what I had already seen.The ending is also predictable (even if you don't know the true history of the actual outcome). But before the film lets us get to what we know is around the corner, we are given character monologues, which again, don't really serve any purpose, nor are suitable for developing characters or moments. I'm not completely negative about the story or the cast, it's just there some elements that are really either ""too little"" or ""too much"", stopping the film from being filled with more heart and a gripping end result.Visuals for Netflix's newest film are incredible and I couldn't fault it. Those who own 4K panels with HDR technology will be rather impressed with visuals in particular to landscape shots.Overall, this is easily one of the better films currently showing on Netflix. The end result can feel unpolished as the film's duration can drag on and our leads unfortunately don't always have any major chemistry together. These are just some of the missing ingredients which could have made this a more gripping or solid film.5.8/10

playing legendary Texas Rangers Frank Hamer & Maney Gault.We see their search beyond Texas where they have no authority interspersed with several cameos from Parker & Barrow murdering their way across the same ground.The FBI was throwing everything at the gang but it was Hamer & Gault using old style Rangers techniques that eventually tracked down the pair and saw they had a fitting end.Superb performances from Costner & Harrelson and a lovely little cameo from William Sadler as Clyde's Dad.",The Highwaymen

Story, acting, and presentation not typical for how Bonnie and Clyde have been portrayed although from what I've read and heard most new research shows Bonnie was just along for the ride and the famous cigar picture was staged and that it's given a false impression. But like everything else now it's considered accurate until it's not. Also the arrogance by the FBI guys also goes against what has come out in recent years as even though the jurisdiction issues that help create the FBI was not as big an issue with this case because of the scope and violence of these two the focus was let's get them and worry about those issues later.

90,harrylosborne,An uninspired retelling with no character,5,15 April 2019,"The overriding feeling throughout The Highwaymen is a sense of confusion: why are the characters so wooden? Why is the script intent on simply ambling by? Why was this film even really made? By the end, I came to the conclusion that Netflix equated famous actors (Harrelson and Costner) plus Bonnie and Clyde to equal a worthwhile cinematic pursuit. This was entirely misjudged, and ultimately means this film falls entirely flat.Some appreciation is due for the set design and attention to detail, accurately emulating 1930s USA; bar this, not many positives can be given. Costner is remarkably flat throughout, and Harrelson resigns to a back seat role that doesn't require his full acting ability. Seeing as the premise relies on the prowess of this duo, all scenes from then on also fail to offer any substance.Overall, a case may be made for retelling the story of Bonnie and Clyde - doing this from the view of the Texas Rangers sent to capture them, however, was not a genius concept, and marks a missed opportunity for Netflix-funded films.",The Highwaymen

However I must say that this film was definitely a solid film all round, it was more enjoyable as the film progressed.Kevin Costner and Woody Harrelson have great chemistry throughout the film, as soon as they are paired up on screen you definitely get the sense that the two of them have some history. Just through their dialogue and mannerisms whilst in each others company earlier on in the film portrays their difficult relationship. However as the film progresses they start to become more familiar once again with each other, as if it was the old days, some great small uses of comedy thrown in. Both of them are good in there roles and carry film along at a decent pace.The film from start to finish is shot absolutely beautifully, its definitely one of the best looking films to be set in that era that I've seen. Credit has to go to John Lee Hancock who does a great job with this film. I have to say though that he is helped by the great locations that the film travels through and the fantastic production design. All of that together really immerses you in the time period and is one of the highlights of the film.Overall the film is 70% out of 100 or 7 out of 10, its a good, solid film with good core performances and interesting story...(how much of it is 100% true.....who knows.....doesn't bother me really)....with some great directing and fantastic production design.

93,cordenw,It's a dud,2,16 April 2019,"Costner, Harrelson and Carroll-Lynch together don't give off any more energy than a 20 watt bulb in this pedestrian production.

I might be exaggerating but the opening credits were still rolling (or was it the final credits?)
Either way it makes no difference because it was a tour- de- force of ham acting , chewing all that scenery from Texas to Missouri to Louisiana.
All that was left for me was tree stumps and the feeling that C,H and C should have stayed at home and let Bonnie and Clyde die of old age.
Somebody from the production team should have cottoned on that this was going nowhere very early on in the project, and pulled the plug.

I actually enjoyed the fact that it focused on the lawmen and Bonnie And Clyde did not actually have to much screen time. I also liked the fact that it did not romanticise or glorify them in any way. They were evil cold blooded killers and were in no way heroes as other productions have tried to interpret them as. The lawmen did have their flaws. They in reality were cold blooded killers too but justified their actions by the fact they were taking out the bad guys and protecting innocents. A flawed justification in many ways but at the same time pretty much true. Without their actions many more would have surely died. My only criticism of this movie was at times it was a complete mumble fest and you could not make out always what the leads were saying. A small criticism though. A really decent movie.,The Highwaymen
96,RhapsodyReviews,Could Have Been Better.,6,7 November 2019,"Review:
'The Highwaymen' is a crime-drama film directed by John Lee Hancock.
The hunt for Bonnie and Clyde, has been tried to be made or remade lots of times, from both sides, and this was the story from the Highwaymen's side.
In 1934, Frank Hamer (Kevin Costner) and Manny Gault (Woody Harrelson), two former Texas Rangers, are commissioned to put an end to the wave of vicious crimes perpetrated by Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow, a notorious duo of infamous robbers and cold-blooded killers who nevertheless are worshiped by the public.
The acting all around was good. I always enjoy Kevin Costner and Woody Harrelson, but I have never seen them in this type of role before.
I think this was a good but not brilliant storytelling. Its a bit shallow, lacks a good chronological timeline and a few parts are too slow to make it a memorable movie.
Overall, this movie is worth a watch for the performances alone. The story is entertained, but lackluster, and I personally would be going back anytime soon for another viewing.

100,fleck05-485-208981,A Couple Former Law Dogs Hunt Killers,8,1 April 2019,"Bonny and Clyde stories are usually told with them as protagonists, and former Texas Ranger Frank Hamer (Costner), as the antagonist. This telling is from Hamer's point of view and sees Bonnie and Clyde for what they were... killers. Not that he, and his former Texas Ranger cohort (Harrelson), always operated above board. They did whatever they felt needed to be done to enforce the law. Their tactics were seen by many, especially governor Ma Ferguson, as tactics for the 1800's wild west, not the modern, civilized 1930's.
The story isn't in a hurry to unfold and the pacing might be a little slow for viewers used to gun battles driving a story forward. But it seemed fitting for the Grapes Of Wrath era where people sat on their porches and listened to the radio to pass the time.
Costner and Harrelson are very good together as grizzled former Rangers dealing with the mental scars from their careers. Kathy Bates also delivers as the ball-buster first female Texas governor, Ma Ferguson. Lynch and Sadler are good as usual, as are the rest of the cast.
I feel like this will get some harsh reviews from viewers used to more PC tellings, but if you grew up watching movies a few decades ago, you're probably going to enjoy this movie a lot.",The Highwaymen

I really wasn't expecting much from a Netflix movie, but I was hooked by the story and the actors involved. Kevin Costner and Woody Harrelson are both indeed great actors and their performance of these biographic characters brought them to life on the big screen. This movie is a different take from the usual Bonnie and Clyde stories that I am used to seeing. The outlaws take on a secondary role in the movie while it focuses on the lawmen who hunted them down to. This movie kept bringing me back to Kevin Costner's 90's movie The Untouchables although this movie is nowhere near as good as that one it does remind me of that era. My only qualm with the movie is how they whitewashed the characters, but I understand that the writers needed the audience to be sympathetic to them.",The Highwaymen

108,intrepidami,"Very Good, however you have to like the true history to enjoy it",8,31 March 2019,"The movie is very slow paced. I get that, that is going to irritate people who want to be entertained, instead of educated. I read through the reviews and found the 1-5 stars were almost universally bored to death, and also can't spell above the 5th grade level.This is not a buddy cop movie. This is not Red Dragon. This is a true story about a couple of retired Rangers being enlisted to execute a couple of rampaging killers. The lead was a proto-profiler who spent a lot of time figuring out Clyde's next moves so he could get out ahead of him and set up a show down.Allow me to explain. There was this RIDICULOUS but popular movie back in the 60's that heavily glorified Bonny and Clyde. Those two were merciless killers. A pair of psychopaths on a rampage. Clyde was very smart, and was using superior firepower and wits to get out of jams. It literally was like the real life Joker and Harley Quinn running around without a Batman to stop them.The public at large did have sympathy for them. Very much like Claude Dallas who went into hiding after killing conservation officers and people were aiding him. The public often takes out their anger at the wrong people, just watch the people at a Walmart customer service berate and argue with the poor low paid employee, instead of getting mad and abusive with management or the owners. No they attack the nobodies. The guys just doing their job.In this movie they are trying TOO HARD to give the alternative take. That these tired, older, far superior ex law enforcement guys were enlisted by higher ups, who wanted to disavow them the whole time, but get the job done. Which, they did.All the other law enforcement are portrayed as more interested beating their own drums, their own agendas, than actually getting the job done. I think that might have been a little exaggerated. Also Bonnie was not known for taking the lead in killing people, as shown here. Other than those things, it is pretty accurate.Costner does a good job of acting here. His character was a man of few words. Stubborn and loyal.How do I feel about this portrayal? When like I said, the other one Hollywood romanticized a couple of monsters, so this was needed.",The Highwaymen
109,DennisBergkamp10,I would watch anything with Woody Harrelson in it.,7,17 June 2020,I envy those people who watch movies in only one language. I watch movies in 5 different languages and average about 5-7 movies a week. So it takes a while to get around to even the good ones. I have had The Highwaymen on me for quite a while but there were so many movies that were ahead in the queue.Finally got around to it yesterday and I can honestly say that I am not disappointed. I had heard of the infamous Bonnie & Clyde but not much other than that. To be honest a lot of people in the world would have heard of Bonnie & Clyde and how they were killed in a shoot-out with the police but not much other than that.When the crime spree of Bonnie & Clyde is at a peak and shows no signs of abating the Governor of Texas decides to bring back two retired Texas rangers to put an end to the menace. Its a chase movie from that point forward.This is not a movie for the 'chase-shootout-explosion' loving movie fans. This is good storytelling. It works at its own pace. There is no big climax. If you did not enjoy 'Dragged across concrete' chances are that you will not enjoy this one either.The acting is brilliant all around. Woody Harrelson is a living legend. Kevin Costner is no less. Kathy Bates is one of the finest actors of this generation.,The Highwaymen
110,jburtonprod-802-759029,A Good but Flawed Telling of 'The Laws' Side of Story,7,28 April 2019,"Generally, this is good telling of the Bonnie and Clyde story from the perspective of the police and Texas Rangers who hunted them down. Kevin Costner and Woody Harrelson are great as Frank Hamer and Manny Gault, respectively. There are a couple problems though. Director John Lee Hancock assumes everybody knows the map of Texas so he never gives you any visual clues, like an actual map, to show you Hamer and Gault's location relative to B&C. As a result, through most of movie it just seems they are wandering aimlessly across Texas and other states until they hear another crime has happened. Then they show up at it's aftermath. They have Woody Harrelson fiddling around with maps a lot. It would've been an easy segue to show a map on screen so we would know the relationship between the two.He also decided to never show us B&C clearly or much of what they were doing (committing crimes, lots and lots of crimes) until the end. While I understand why he did that, it never actually makes the case for why the law thought an ambush was the only way to take them downAs for the ambush...That is the HUGEST flaw of this film and if they had screened the movie for an audience in Texas, when Kevin Costner comes out of the blind and stands right in front of Bonnie and Clyde's car and says, 'Stick 'um Up.' they would've heard cackling laughter. It's a totally ridiculous 'Hollywood' scene and it takes you out of the movie at the time you should be most in it. Also, everybody knows that is not how it went down. Hamer and crew opened up on them as soon as they came to a halt. The bullet holes in the real car show NO BULLET holes from where they have Costner/Hamer standing. It's clear the only bullet holes in the windshield, which were on the passenger side only, came after Clyde's foot slipped of the clutch and the car drifted while the officers shot at Bonnie and Clyde's lifeless bodies.Given those flaws it was still a good and engaging movie and kept pretty close to the facts. It's good fun for lovers of True Crime.",The Highwaymen

A specific moment that stands out to me is the moment when Hamer is talking to Clyde's father at the gas station. What a deep sequence, I loved the whole moment from start to finish, you really learn the driving force behind Hamer and his need to distinguish right and wrong from the world.Costner and Harrelson both are fantastic in the film.

124,GavWaskett,Walker has nothing on these two!,7,4 October 2020,"It's not everyday that a film is able to tell a story about two of the most famous criminals in history without seeing their faces for 99.9% of the film, you see their car, the back of their heads, the carnage and horror they left behind, but not them. And that is perfect, as this film is about the Texas Rangers who set out to end their killing spree.Based on the accounts of the Texas Rangers and Officers who were there at the end, this manages to show trail of blood and loss left behind them and their gang, as well as the hero worship they enjoyed from the everyday folk who were suffering financially in America at the time, who saw them as an equivalent of Robin Hood, even though they were killing innocent people as well as innocent officers. It was one of the first cases of celebrity for no fricking reason!Kevin Costner plays Frank Hamer and Woody Harrelson is Maney Gault, two rangers who pursued and ended these criminals. And in these two actors you have two heavy weights who bring serious gravitas and power to these roles of two retired Rangers, who are trying to do what Police Forces around the country have failed to do.I honestly don't know how historically accurate the film is, I did read bits about the officers portrayed in this film and of the events that took place and to be honest, I'm not sure if we'll ever know exactly what went down on that road way. But what we do know is two serial killers were stopped and people went mad with thousands travelling to the small town to see the bodies and the car they were shot it. It's all a bit mad when you think about it, like the social media frenzy that people generate now but the thirties equivalent.I found this a powerful telling of this story with some amazing actors who with their stature gives this movie the serious nature that this subject matter deserves. Thomas Mann also stands out as Deputy Ted Hinton, an officer who knew the people he was chasing as they were growing up and was occasionally accused of letting that affect his judgement, he also refuted how they were lured to the ambush in a book published two years after his death, stating that the posse agreed for the truth to be told when they had all passed away, this has obviously been disputed and denied. Well probably never know what really happened but if this was today, we'd definitely have psychological profiles of B &C and how they got to be the way they were through trauma and they would have a following the like of which the Kardashians would cry over but we instead have a very good film telling the story of a few brave men.

126,jasontheterrible,Anti-Law Enforcement Pro-Criminal Garbage From Beginning to End,1,26 July 2020,"Both Karl Marx and Engels claimed criminals should be allowed to kick us in the head and commit their crimes without punishment because they were simply the victims of an oppressive society. But like all good socialists and communists, they only meant that to apply to your houses. Marx himself kicked his guest out of his own house for being a lazy, no-good scoundrel.This film is pure garbage with non-stop speeches from Woody Harrelson about too much bloodshed from the police. We're no better than the criminals because we try to kill them, Woody says. His lines are all worn out tropes.There is also a tearful speech by dear old daddy Barrow about how terrible it is they are trying to find and kill his son who got started stealing a chicken because they were all hungry and it was the Depression. So, of course, criminals should not be punished or pursued. They are just oppressed, poor, hungry victims no matter how many times they rob, kill or maim.None of what is verbalized in this film is true. None of it was actually said There were never any regretful, pitiful, weak cowardly cops unsure of right and wrong. It was wrong to murder innocent people. It was right to kill those murderers.The main law enforcement officer Purvis was said to have committed suicide but that is not what the coroner thought. Later it was determined that he was trying to remove a tracer bullet and accidentally lost his life when the gun fired. The movie wants you to think he could not stand the thought of enforcing the law by lethal means and killed himself. Total BS.Hey Woody and writer John Fusco, better hope the rapists cannot get into your gated communities, over your high walls, and past the armed security guarding your compounds. If they do I hope you can talk them into nice, peaceful crimes.No Karl, Woody and Hollywood, good people protect their homes and their families and their countries from killers using any means necessary.

This plays out mostly in the background the events of the film, but the presence of The Great Depression is almost another character of this movie.It also treats the villains as more like monsters in a horror movie than criminals. The film doesn't show their faces for a while, letting you know them through their horrific deeds then slowly revealing their appearance over time.

The well-written script, captivating story, good acting (especially Kevin Costner & Woody Harrelson), good set design, among other qualities. The story is well known and it is about the attempted capture of the Bonnie and Clyde gangsters in the 1930s by two former Texas Rangers. Being a biographical crime movie, it has a credible script, with logic and nexus. It is a film that resembles a little one in which Costner also acted, The Untouchables (1987).

132,makleen2,"A buddy cop tale with a historical twist, this nihilistic Netflix drama leans too heavily on worn-out cliches",7,8 April 2019,"The story of the men who took down Bonnie and Clyde is recounted in The Highwaymen (2019), written by John Fusco and directed by John Lee Hancock. This bleak Netflix production aims to de-glamorize the infamous outlaw lovers with a more nuanced perspective, but still can't help indulging in a few popular myths.When Bonnie Parker (Emily Brobst) and Clyde Barrow (Edward Bossert) mastermind a prison farm escape, Lee Simmons (John Carroll Lynch) convinces Texas Governor ""Ma"" Ferguson (Kathy Bates) to bring ex-Texas Ranger Frank Hamer (Kevin Costner) out of retirement. Hamer agrees, and after purchasing a small arsenal of weapons, he reluctantly teams up with Maney Gault (Woody Harrelson), another ex-Ranger past his prime.Despite being ""too old for this s--t"", Hamer and Gault use experience and gut instinct to show up a team of FBI agents utilizing the latest law enforcement techniques, led by Agent Kendale (Jason Davis). After a string of false leads and narrow misses, the elderly lawmen finally gripe, complain, and manipulate their way into locating the outlaw gang. A young deputy named Ted Hinton (Thomas Mann), who grew up with Bonnie Parker, is there to provide dark irony and identify the criminals' bullet-riddled bodies.Channeling Neo-Westerns like No Country for Old Men (2007) and Wind River (2017), and to some extent the TV series True Detective, The Highwaymen focuses on a life-or-death pursuit through an unforgiving and bleak environment, with characters the modern world has left behind. Unfortunately, and despite its original contribution to the Bonnie and Clyde filmography, it comes across as an unimaginative imitation of these other works.Historically, Clyde Barrow and his gang were petty criminals who robbed, kidnapped, and murdered their way across several states. By 1934, the gang was allegedly responsible for 13 murders, including nine police officers. History would probably have forgotten them if not for Clyde's lover, Bonnie Parker, a waifish thrill-seeker who accompanied the gang. The story of a good girl gone bad was irresistible to the American press and public, but Bonnie and Clyde's run ended in a hail of bullets when lawmen ambushed their car in rural Louisiana.Unlike other films about Bonnie and Clyde, The Highwaymen focuses on Frank Hamer and Maney Gault, the ex-lawmen who tracked them down and arranged the ambush. The filmmaker's attention to historical detail is admirable, even including Texas' first female governor, Miriam ""Ma"" Ferguson. But The Highwaymen falls into the same trap as all the other films by portraying Bonnie Parker as a submachine gun toting cold blooded killer. In really, there's no evidence she ever fired a shot.If you enjoy dreary, depressing, and monotone films that completely lack creativity, or if you're a fan of classic cars, you'll love The Highwaymen. But seriously, it's a competent film with a great lead cast and a different take on a familiar story. It just fails to do anything interesting with the genre. The filmmakers didn't take any risks.The Highwaymen was released on Netflix, so there are no box office returns, but it currently has a 53% positive critic rating and 78% audience rating on RottenTomatoes. Overall, I'd put my rating at somewhere between those two numbers.",The Highwaymen

But the sensitivity to the characters of the two Texas Rangers shines through, the way I know director John Lee Hancock intended. I spent time in college at meal times in cafeteria with this director-to-be, and realized in 1997 in his writing of the screenplay, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, how he had honed his sensitive caring nature into this great talent.

It's partly due to the script which is just cringe worthy in some moments, trying desperately to sound period authentic to the point that it seems like a parody.

I liked the dynamics between Woody Harrelson and Kevin Costner. The movie starts at the 'end' of Bonnie & Clyde's time of terror (the prison break they made happen is how the film starts). I also liked the fact that the director choose not to glorify the gangsters but instead the ones who try to stop them. However, the quite extreme choice of making both gangsters almost anonymous (you only see their faces a few times) and the conservative amount of violence shown prior to their deaths (which is very violent) leaves me wondering whether the movie would have been more interesting if we'd seen more of the deadly duo. What were their motives? Who were they?
Also the violent ending also makes the good guys look like monsters - the bad guys get brutally executed, even though the bad guys choose to grab their weapons when they realize it's over. I don't think that was the director's intend, or at least it feels ambiguous.",The Highwaymen

153,hamlet-16,A true classic...,8,10 April 2019,"The Highwaymen is a true cinema. It has pacing that requires concentration and attention. This not a film to watch whilst checking Facebook at the same time.This is a film to savour carefully. The dialogue and the details deserve that.Whilst some of the standard Hollywood buddy movie tropes are present, they are not excessive nor redundant to the plot.In terms of accuracy around the chase for the Barrow gang there are points of controversy about the shootout and the role of Methvin that are not settled and they are largely avoided by the film.And I can quibble with the treatment of state and federal police. After-all without the work of hundreds of police in multiple states Hamer would not have had the details he needed to crack the case.(Equally Ma Ferguson's administration was thoroughly corrupt ... or not depending on your point of view and her disbandment of the Rangers was or was not due to their refusal to work with her corrupt administration. History is rarely black and white But how many of us knew Texas had a female governor in 1934!.)But that said Hamer's skill in tracking down the murderous gangsters against a backdrop of public adoration and simultaneous repulsion for the Barrow gang and is really the core of the film.For me this is without doubt Costner's finest performance ever. His silence speaks volumes and his physical appearance resonates with weariness but also resolve.Woody Harrelson is marvellous as Gault. He and Costner are so believable as old buddies who have been through hell and back.Add to this mix a beautiful score by Thomas Newman ..with a touch of Copland and exquisite cinematography by John Schwartzman and amazing production design.The Highwaymen is classic, in the true sense of the word, and very classy cinema.

164,kckidjoseph-1,"Not What You Would Expect -- In a Very, Very Good Way",10,30 April 2019,"In development for many years and originally pitched by writer John Fusco as a possible vehicle for Paul Newman and Robert Redford, ""The Highwaymen,"" just out with Kevin Costner and Woody Harrelson in the leads, was well worth the wait. Directed by John Lee Hancock with a sure hand, it tells the story of two ex-Texas Rangers who try to track down the notorious Bonnie and Clyde.
Unlike the glammed-up, Technicolored 1967 theatrical release with Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway as two drop-dead gorgeous class clowns whose barbarism is wrapped in designer togs and hidden by BIG STAR TURNS, this is a tense, sparse, color-drained story with naturalistic, perfectly underplayed performances that captures the desperate chase to stop the rampage of two animalistic criminals at once feared and revered by the public in an America on the rebound in 1934.
Frank Hamer (Costner) and Many Gault (Harrelson) are the former Texas Ranger partners who come out of retirement to attempt the nearly impossible, not only trying to anticipate the next moves of Bonnie and Clyde but having to overcome both federal and local authorities either overzealous or sympathetic to the criminals while working their way through dirt-poor towns who consider the killers heroes who are hitting back at the establishment. Sometimes the towns are peopled by Bonnie and Clyde's family, or close friends of the pair.
The tension of whether Hamer and Gault will be done in before they get to the criminal couple is palpable.
To complicate matters, Hamer and Gault, while they trust and respect each other, are opposites. Hamer has a kill or be killed attitude, while Gault, who once had a drinking problem, wonders if the haven't become as bad as the people they're chasing. A telling scene when the two old lawmen find Bonnie and Clyde's hideaway illustrates how different the two men feel about the task at hand -- Gault tenderly fingers a hair brush of Bonnie's as though she's a wayward teen, noting by her dress size how small she is, while Hamer just considers it all a clue to be tucked away should they confront her.
Costner and Harrelson have never been better. Costner's Hamer is a tired, bitter lawmen who once led a near massacre of 54 bad guys, a man who once was close to becoming a pastor before fate viciously intervened, while Harrelson is his supportive if reluctant conscience, realizing what has to be done but hating every minute of it.
Harrelson has established himself as the heir apparent to Jack Nicholson as an actor who can do just about anything, and Costner has sharpened his Gary Cooper-ish naturalism to a fine point that utterly convinces you you're watching the real thing, not acting.
""The Highwaymen"" is not what you would expect, in a good way. It's a superb character study, a chronicle of the times, and a cracking good police procedural all rolled into one. Not a bit of it seems trite or predictable, and the end when the credits roll masterfully puts the whole thing in perspective.
It's easily a five-star out of five film.
While I come down on Steven Spielberg's side in the Oscar controversy being waged against Netflix, credit where credit's due. This Netflix production is tops, and well worth your time, even and especially if you think you're not into this kind of movie. It's that good.",The Highwaymen

The lead performances from Kevin Costner and Woody Harrleson were brilliant, the story is riveting (it's a bit of a slow burn so to be clear) and there's definitely an old fashioned feel that's aided by direction from John Lee Hancock (The Blind Side, Saving Mr. Banks).The writers do the commendable act of stripping away the romanticism around Bonnie and Clyde; showing the impressionable love for them by hundreds of young people from that era and contrast it with the horrific killings left by them in their path.The film gets redundant at times and a bit too long, but I was engaged from start to finish.

I blame the uninspired camera work (lots of fixed angles and shot-reverse-shot conversations) and an editor who doesn't seem to know how to let a scene breath for more than a nanosecond. For example, there's an innocuous thirty second scene where a woman gets out of a car, speaks to a man, then walks towards a house. I counted 27 edits. It's just insane.Technically, this thing is dreadful. Costume design is passable and the set design is uninteresting (as far as I can tell, the director doesn't seem very excited by anything in the frame). The acting is sombre (nobody had a sense of humour in the 20s, it seems, and everybody spoke with a thousand yard stare) and none of the actors 'bring it' to this production.Not terrible, but not very cinematic. It has the whiff of a TV movie about it. And a daytime one at that.",The Highwaymen

Why is there a scene where Clyde's father talks about what a good boy he was and there is no mention that there was a brother named Buck who was also a criminal? Buck Barrow gets mentioned only once and Blanche not at all, and even if the story begins after Buck's death there would have been a way to work that information into the narrative.

And Woody Harrelson proves again why he is one of the most durable actors around. These were the men that had been to Hell and back before PTSD was ever talked about..My first impression is that these roles are ""custom cut"" for these actors. Just watching them work together is a fine thing. They catch the spirit and catch the moves with skill...Good production values also. They didn't have to build expensive sets. What they needed still exists in Dixie.""Was you really Frank Hamer""? A kid asked. Apparently the Texas Rangers had been disbanded by then. But, crime was as vicious as ever. The authorities realize they need to break out of their political comfort zone and actually get men that can do the job. Politicians hate Hard Men...until they need them. Maybe this is a lesson for today. The Politicians got scared and called the ""Old School"" out of retirement. The criminal ""Hipsters"" were doomed from that moment.Filmed in the Louisiana ""Ark-La-Tex"" area where the real events happened is a plus. My understanding is that Costner was a major factor in starting movie production in Louisiana. You could get good quality cinema production work there done for twenty-five cents on the dollar compared to So. California . So California priced itself out of the 21st century in favor of ""Ol Louisiana"" and Canada.

184,mkm-hermanjnr,A realistic film that touches on the dark side of both crime and law enforcement,8,9 May 2019,"The Highwaymen tells the real life story of Bonnie and Clyde from the perspective of the two Texas Rangers (or rather, ex-Texas Rangers) sent in pursuit of the pair in order to stop their ruthless crime spree.The agents (Frank Hamer and Maney Gault) are played wonderfully by Costner and Harrelson, with just the right mix of humour, gruffness and sincere dialogue to sell them as the part without hitting cheesy notes or playing off the ""buddy cop"" cliche.It's fortunate that the actors do so well alongside one another as the entire movie plays off of their relationship and their joint investigation of Clyde and his gang.Perhaps my favourite aspect of the movie is it's approach to the couple. They are almost never seen until the end, and when they are seen it is usually frightening and fleeting. The ruthless and brutal murders they commit are shown for what they were, refreshingly without that awful temptation to glam things up and exaggerate like you get in most crime movies.In fact one of the central mysteries the film posits is why Bonnie and Clyde were perversely seen as cult anti-heroes in the first place, considering the appalling acts of violence they wantonly commit. The scenes of people mobbing their car, smiling and cheering are shown almost immediately after we see Bonnie blast a helpless man in the head. All kinds of interesting questions about human nature are raised in those two scenes alone.I also like that, in the opposite vein, the film goes onto the topic of the extreme (and often borderline unethical) actions inevitably required to stop criminals as violent as Clyde's gang. A fantastic monologue near the end of the film implies the agents live with both the satisfaction of stopping vicious brigands and also the guilt of having to employ utterly uncompromising and lethal methods to stop them. To an extent, they must adopt the same ruthlessness as their quarry in order to succeed in the hunt.This monologue comes right before the ending and compliments it perfectly. Bonnie and Clyde are ambushed and practically executed, but as we have seen throughout the film, this was the measure *required* to stop them. Does that make it good or bad? Ethical or unethical? Did they deserve any better than the innocent people they ambushed and murdered themselves?Perhaps my one criticism of the film is that it can drag and get a little same-y over the run time. Frankly there was no point that I did not enjoy, though, and I would prefer a slower paced realistic film over a zany exaggerated glamourised nonsense-salad of a crime movie so this one gets an 8/10 from me.",The Highwaymen

From what I remember, the movie glorified Bonnie and Clyde and made them into Folk Heroes. 'The Highwaymen' with Kevin Costner and Woody Harrelson (two of my favourite leading men) is a wonderful movie, telling the truth of it. Bonnie and Clyde were callous thrill killers. Watching this movie from the perspective of the Rangers and other Law Enforcement officers was enthralling for me and seeing the re-imagining of the time period of 1934, more than 20 years before I was born, was so interesting. Kevin Costner's wonderful character 'Poncho', in reality, died a few months before I was born. How the World and Law Enforcement has changed over this time period. See this movie and I hope like me, the time will pass way too quickly. I'll watch it many more times.",The Highwaymen
194,featheredsun,Ignore the Netflix Teaser - A Thoughtful Period Piece on the Nature of Crime and Justice,8,27 April 2019,"Some folks are prepared to shed blood.This film takes a sober look at this fact.Set in and around Texas in 1934, The action takes us into the furor of the hunt for Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow at the end of their murderous romance of crime and celebrity. Two ex-lawmen...Texas Rangers...Frank Hamer (Kevin Costner) and B.M. ""Maney"" Gault (Woody Harrelson) are called out of their retirement to hunt down the infamous couple to put an end to their criminal sprees and the folk legends they had cultivated.As the plot progresses, we see a panorama of lives gone wrong - the old yarn of country outlaws, always one step ahead of the hounds of Justice, but the film shows this from a different angle and takes care to portray the crushing, pervasive poverty that allows this sort of yarn, and the skeins of bloody death it leaves behind. While it's doubtless the pair had their own disfigured kind of romance, and that may be worth it's own view, this film focuses on the endless running, the hunted and haunted nature of pursuit, and the inevitable broken and mangled end.It's this grimness that sets apart this film. No glorification in the gunnery and gore - this story reminds us at every turn that real human lives are ending at every step.The significant insight of this film is that sometimes society will call for the hunters of monsters. And these hunters have their own savage wisdom. The Rangers were once disbanded because they became almost as feared as the ones they hunted. But it's that savage wisdom that made society call for them again when their methods were needed.Gault and Hamer were not hired to catch Bonnie and Clyde. They were hired to put them down. Costner and Harrelson perfectly portray these men who can sense their own savage nature, who are intimately familiar with it, yet who do not revel in it - men who want only in the end to use it for some greater good - to hunt these monsters, to buy a little more peace overall. They see the bloody bargain and know what they must do...and how serious it is.Frankly, we can debate that premise in real life. But in the context of this story, it is a very solid sociological context, and worthy of all the exploration this film gives it. I think that's what struck me - the solemnity and sadness with which this struggle is portrayed.Even in victory, the pair are simply glad to be done...glad the bloodshed is over once again. They want no more glory than a simple acknowledgement of doing a difficult and necessary job.So this is definitely worth a viewing if you like a more thoughtful version of the old-timey gangster story. And the elements of the film were all quite good. The setting was well captured by wonderful set production really capturing the period. The film's angles and character framing was well shot, as well as some very interesting cinematography during the pursuit scenes. And the acting was very well done. Harrelson was haunting and vulnerable even while being very charming, and Costner...damn...Costner was stone cold in this role - very gritty and hard as a coffin nail.And it's this last part that makes me very ANGRY with Netflix for framing this as some kind of smarmy buddy cop vehicle, like Grumpy Old Men meets Lethal Weapon, with some Texas twang sprinkled on top. The teaser actually made me NOT want to see it because I thought it'd be nothing but two old geezers trading stale humor. I'm glad the premise on its own sounded interesting enough for me to give it a try.",The Highwaymen

I suspect the target audience is people with a short attention span. That's unfortunate because if this movie was just a little more exquisite, it could have been great. The story, the production design, and the acting were all excellent. It had a classic feel that was cheapened by a modern day approach. What I disliked about this movie, as well as some other modern movies, is that we, the viewers, were subjected to an overdose of coverage. Constant cutting throughout. The actors can't say one line of dialogue without the editor cutting to a different angle. It was like a neck jerk. I suppose this is to hold a viewer's interest, but it's purposeless filmmaking and it doesn't allow us time to appreciate the performances or the cinematography. While the story was great, the writing was a little preachy at times which gave it the feel of a made for TV movie.

This version is darker and more compelling but is missing something. That something is the right actor to play Hamer. He is written in this screenplay as a hard assed, dedicated and determined tracker who feels no compunction about his willingness to kill. There is a scene where Hamer meets someone close to Clyde and this man understands that the life Clyde is living can come to no good end. He looks at Hamer and marks him as a killer. I just couldn't buy Costner as a man easy to mark as a killer. Imagine a middle aged Christopher Walken perhaps. Maybe Joaquin Phoenix. But other than that casting decision, it is a fine film. I enjoyed it and it is worth watching. A good performance from Costner nonetheless and Harrelson made a good sidekick.",The Highwaymen
200,screenotes,Adept as a police procedural drama but forgets to add jeopardy,6,3 May 2019,"The Highwaymen (2019), in which a pair of Texas Rangers come out of retirement to catch the infamous outlaws Bonnie and Clyde is not your typical buddy cop movie. Nor is it your standard Bonny & Clyde fare. In fact, there's a sense the film doesn't quite know what it is.It is at its best when it is essentially a police procedural with the Rangers relying on experience and instinct, methodically hunting down the ruthless killers. And their ruthlessness is laid bare here, juxtaposed unsubtly yet occasionally powerfully with evidence of their celebrity status.While this perspective is valid and indeed interesting, Highwaymen at times gets lost when seeking to justify excessive methods used by the authorities. In particular, the more exposition of the Rangers' violent backstories, the more it comes unstuck. Primarily, this is because the Rangers are never setup as anything other than the heroes of the piece.There are solid performances from Costner and Harrelson as the leads and the film is well-crafted from a technical standpoint yet in the end, The Highwaymen tries to do a bit too much with a relatively simple story and ends up feeling overlong.",The Highwaymen

A bit of a slow burn, but the tension builds up to a fantastic climax that completely reverses the premise of the famous 1967 film Bonnie and Clyde. There the murderous outlaws were portrayed as heroes, much put upon by a corrupt law enforcement system. Here it's reluctant old men drawn back into crime fighting to stop two vicious psychopaths on a killing spree.The movie builds slowly so as to establish Costner's and Harrelson's characters, basically two ex Texas Rangers past their prime, but persuaded to take one last job as a last resort to bring two elusive killers to justice. What I like about this version is that it focuses almost entirely on the protagonists, and keeps the psycho killers at a distance, a sort of menacing presence in the background. You see instead the careful way in which the lawmen go about their business and eventually corner the baddies and give em a taste of their own medicine.It's one of those old fashioned type movies that focuses on building suspense rather than graphic violence and action. It harks back to the old West when the line between good guys and bad guys was a little grey. To get the really bad guys you needed a couple of not so bad guys.",The Highwaymen

I'm not going to say anything specific about scenes as I don't want the spoiler block so I am just giving my observation of the film overall. Have people totally lost the sense of what a good movie is cause this definitely isn't that and if you want to watch a better movie along the same lines watch Natural Born Killers no one cares about the law enforcement stopping them and the same goes for this film I would rather have the focus be on Bonnie and Clyde's perspective not the law that stopped them.,The Highwaymen

Yes, people were stupid back then and sucked in cancer causing cigarette smoke. So yes, in a way that was realistic to the era. But only in a way. Not everyone smoked back then. The smoking rate was about 40 percent in reality. In this movie, the smoking rate for characters is far higher than it was in reality.
Why does this movie glorify smoking? How much did the tobacco industry pay for such excessive product placement and promotion?
To me, the smoking scenes ruined what could have been a decent movie but instead was just an extended commercial for smoking. I was waiting for the ""Winston's Taste Good Like a Cigarette Should"" theme to roll on....
I really wonder about the Netflix original movies and how much they must be funded by corporate tobacco lobbies.

209,katrinatiebel,Incredibly Well Done,9,11 April 2019,"Most people have watched Bonnie and Clyde movies that often romanticized the criminals that committed brutal crimes during their crime spree in the early 1930's. This film sets up the scene of the spree showing the tough times of the Great Depression and how many people viewed banks as the enemy as their properties were being seized and how Bonnie and Clyde emerged as a Robin Hood symbol to many who were suffering at that time. In fact, the couple had an almost Beatles fan-hysteria for that time and it should be noted that thousands of people attended both criminals' funerals. It introduces former Texas Rangers Frank Hamer and Mandy Gualt reluctantly called upon my Governor ""Ma"" Ferguson after persuasion from Texas Dept of Corrections Lee Simmons to capture or kill the fugitives due to the blatant failure of the FBI and numerous law makers to do so. It is important to note that at this time the Texas Rangers had been disbanded. Our protagonists, long retired, aged and out of practice track the criminals, while being sabatoged and disrespected by FBI members and ""Ma"" herself. It is a raw, honest depiction of two well-seasoned Rangers taking on one of the most difficult manhunts in American history. The acting by Costner and Harrelson is phenomenal, they show the true pain and frustration that past traumas and the reality of the world can press upon these veteran rangers on a case seemingly personal to them. The cinematography, costuming and sets are on point. Although long, it kept me engaged and interested and was peppered with some humor. Costner and Harrelson played off each other well.

I really enjoyed Costner's role. His cerebral acting brought a lot of seriousness to the movie, and Harrelson's more lighthearted character created a good foil. In addition to good acting, the shots of the South were beautiful and I thought the music worked really well.What didn't:
The movie moved pretty slowly throughout, almost to the point where I wanted to skip ahead.

The reason I wanted to watch this film was because of Kathy Bates and Woody Harrelson. Kathy is my goddess and I had the good fortune to have met her in person and I sat next to her during the screening of my friend's film in Los Angeles 25 years ago.
In ""The Highwaymen"", Kathy had a minuscule role. She must have been on the screen all of 5 seconds ( I am kidding of course). But Mama can still deliver the goods.
Woody Harrelson was superb as I had expected.
But the real gem was Kevin Costner. He rendered such a masterful performance, that he ought to be receiving some major awards.

It starts strong as the leads track down Bonnie and Clyde using good old fashioned detective work with a Western feel, and it's got some great 1930s gumshoe-esque stuff going on. The period notes are generally very good and only occasionally off the mark - such as a depression-era tent city with somehow all bleached-white tents.It stumbles toward the finish line. It just can't help but paint the two mains as these brooding, conflicted, melancholy-about-their-pasts-but-dutifully-doing-what-needs-to-be-done types. It's an anti-Western theme which has been done to death at this point and this one doesn't add anything new.

Two actors are really like and, they both performed without any disappointment. I'm becoming more of a Kevin Costner fan since he is playing some tough guy roles that John Wayne would play if he were alive. I've been watching Costner's Yellowstone show each week and really appreciate a show about modern cowboys. Too many western films have been made of ""cowboys"" who carry guns and shoot one another, rather than riding horses and roping cows and doing ranch work.True stories are my favorite genre and this was a interesting rendition of the Bonnie and Clyde fable.",The Highwaymen

I had allways had trouble putting a face on Hammer and the only other one I had was the Bonnie and Clyde movie with Warren Beatty.
The whole production was outstanding without once showing any actions of Bonnie and Clyde and concentrating on Hammers struggles with FBI and other law enforcement agencies. Cathy Bates role as Texas Governor was perfect. A movie that should not be missed",The Highwaymen

It doesn't glorify violence, but manages to show the brutality of B&C.
Our protagonists are old broken men who themselves are guilty of some shady stuff in the past, that's why they were hired.
I got a true detective vibe from their relationship. They spent the time to show them as believable characters.
The 'action' is sparse (it's not that kind of movie) but when the shooting starts it sounded authentic and beefy. These weapons were terrifying in the hands of B&C, and were not ignored in the telling of the story.
Loved the way you never quite get a proper glimpse of them until the end, and the reveal really worked.Nice to see Costner, always a pleasure to see Woody.Great stuff.",The Highwaymen

250,LaSaggezza,A New Take On An Old Plot,7,30 March 2019,"First off, Netflix is proving itself, more and more, that it can compete with the long established players in the media industry. The Highwaymen present top tier stars, Kevin Costner, Woody Harrelson and Kathy Bates as well as other familiar names in the industry. An indeed, the performances were really good. The dialogue and script were fine,It's also worth noting that it was technically excellent, bringing that long dead depression era back to life with a stark reality; the sets, clothing styles and cars really contribute to this period piece.As far as being historically accurate, well, I'm not a historian and I never view a drama based on fact as anything else but entertainment, which brings me to the downside. It's a bit slow. It has its exciting moments, but it's more of a detective story than exciting run-chase action drama.My one pet peeve is when the leading strong-silent type leading male mumbles with a gravelly voice. Costner's performance was great, but I turned on the English subtitles.",The Highwaymen

I thought Kevin Costner and Woody Harrelson were well cast and great in their respective rolls . The bad guys were in no way glorified which is a refreshing change. Captures the poverty and hardships of the time well. Good story , entertaining watch .",The Highwaymen
253,themfs,Very enjoyable and well done,8,14 April 2019,"In my opinion, this is a great movie. I liked the story and Costner and Harrelson are great together.

254,blackhawk5150,Incredible,9,31 March 2019,"I initially gave this movie an ""8"", but only because true crime is not my favorite genre. Having worked for nearly two decades as a ""lawman"" myself, I usually gravitate towards lighter plots. But in fairness, I had to change my rating to a ""9"". It is an exceptional movie. It rings true in every way, from the era, to the relationships, to the suspense. Harrelson and Costner are believable as tired but steady Texas Rangers, and they do the profession proud. I've hunted cop killers personally, and this movie nails it. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the genre.

255,m-fallon67,"Finally, the real story",8,2 April 2019,"Finally, a much more accurate account, of the take down of Bonnie and Clyde, from a more truthful, realistic point of view. The two retired Texas Rangers, Hamer and Gualt, were the real deal, played well by Kevin Costner, and Woody Harrelson. A little long, and tighter script, might of been better, however, the film does a great job of educating us, on the two lawman, what they were about, and some scenes where they shared their brief experiences, and some of the gray lines between black and white. Frank Hamer especially, in real life, was I believe, the greatest lawman in Texas, AND USA history. Bass Reeves, a famed U.S. Marshal, is second. His story needs telling too, but I digress. Hamer was a quiet unassuming man, who never wanted attention. I am glad Hollywood finally brought out a more realistic account. Bonnie and Clyde, in real life, nothing more than sociopathic murderers, who enjoyed their brief sadistic fame.",The Highwaymen

The scene between Costner and Sadler is the movie. There is a rationalization of both cop and robber. It pleased me to see Harrelson bate the Cajun sheriff into showing his fidelity to the law. Plenty of Dreddlike ""I am the law"" and enough ire from the poor in the movie to show how difficult it was to track Bonnie and Clyde through the Big XII. FBI planes flying over a rural area can hinder an investigation about as much as wiretaps can help. Costner and Harrelson make a good team, I'd like to see them play again.",The Highwaymen
260,dlaird8,One of Netflix's Best,8,7 April 2019,"First of all Costner and Harrelson still have it. Costner does his usual brooding tough guy, and Harrelson the slightly goofball but capable partner, very well.
This is, for the most part, a reasonably accurate historical telling of the 'attempt' to capture Bonnie and Clyde.
Very enjoyable throughout. Obviously has some added scenes for action and to try and provide background into the main characters. None of that however detracts from the story. If you're looking for a film that has good story, well acted, but doesn't try to be as high brow or media arts student essay like a Coen film, you'd be hard pressed to go past The Highwaymen.",The Highwaymen

It really does do all those spectacularly well shot shots spectacularly well. The performances also Quality; strong and solid - just as you'd expect from these two veteran lads. The story is mostly well paced and um, easy to follow. You wouldn't be wasting your time sitting down to watch this movie. Not at all. But (here it comes) it severely lacks SPARKLE. I'd have settled for sparkle in any form - a bit of irreverent humour, or any sort of humour actually, some surprise twists and turns in the narrative, some nuanced ambiguity on the moral compass, unexpected jigging with the timeline, quirks, mistakes - anything to lift it out of it's solid, conservative Quality traditionalism. The nearest it gets is to expose the true hideousness of it's usually ""heroic"" villains - so an extra point for that. I'm sure it fulfilled its Netflix brief.",The Highwaymen

But we see the perspective of the rangers, as they slowly chase their prey.The screenwriting and dialogue is exquisitely crafted. The sound choice, music, and sound quality are top notch. The directing and picture are high end. And the casting and performances all around are on point.Overall, I could hardly find a flaw in this movie and can't wait to watch it a second time.

This movie portrays them as what they were... Murderers.Instead the movie focuses on the two real heroes of the story, two dogged old former Texas Rangers, Frank Hamer (Kevin Costner) and B.M. ""Maney"" Gault (Woody Harrelson), who are reluctantly assigned to Hunt down the notorious couple by Miriam Amanda ""Ma"" Ferguson (Kathy Bates).Costner and Harrelson play off each other well, the banter between the two characters is well written, they make a perfect 'Old school buddy cop team'. Both men were alive during end of the wild west period and you can see them both struggle with 'modern' investigation techniques. (A scene where Hamer explains 'Phone Wire Tapping' to Gault, shows this perfectly) And two old style gunfighters adapting to 'how things are done these days'What is interesting is that you never see the faces of Bonnie Parker or Clyde Barrow until the end. The final ambush scene is brutal and not for the faint hearted.One of the best period pieces of American history brought to life through movie making I have ever seen.

There's enough background to make sense. Screenplay is mostly taut and the direction is good. But it is Harrelson and Costner that bring it all to mean much more than its mere sum. Both are excellent ... especially Costner who takes to westerns and baseball flicks like duck to water.

I am glad this movie serves neither.There is nothing to admire in Bonnie and Clyde. They were psychopaths who enjoyed killing and that's about the whole of their story.The story of the two rangers that tracked and stopped them is much more appealing than a story of psychos in love. We live in a culture where men of law are portrayed as cold-hearted killers and this sentiment hurts society. This movie presents a different case and for that it has my respect.Bonnie and Clyde should have never been idolized, and they will always be as such. It baffles me how people admire them.

But then... the color keying and mastering is so jumpy, it almost looks like the film was edited inserting untouched material in a final rushed run. Windshields not depolarized, no dust, no dirt, all just clean strait out of the package. Also the editing is so wishful, almost hysterical at times, it feels so cheap with this heavy topic. The sound is terrible. Shots and music just blast out super loud, unnecessary - unless this is supposed to be a retro gun advertisement while dialog mumbles away in poorly recorded mess of on-set-reverb.
I don't get it. It is a recipe with an almost fail-safe outcome and yet, the immersion is denied because the editing, post and also lots of the camera work are sloppy? Is this a message like ""that's what you get, when you turn away from big picture studio movies?"".
I sense a pretty decent fan-edit in there. This could have been a solid 7 with a bias towards a straight 8, if it had been done right.

I like the front-seat acting of the co-leads, Costner and Harrelson, the latter of whom gets a lot of space as the wing-man. Since Costner's part is written without a shred of humor, and the actor plays it with magnificent gravity, Woody gets to show off his comic chops and sideman skills. Over the years, he's gotten to be such a great character actor. It's funny how at the very end of the movie, Costner's character finally lets Harrelson's character drive--he's earned it!

Not disappointed.
90% filmed in Louisiana, where B&C's rampages finally concluded.
Cast beautifully, 'A list' in my view:
HARRELSON best actor material, Costner back to his best, Kathy Bates, Kim Dickson, plus support, ALL.Loved the deliberate detailed build up.
To some, it seemed a slow film, not I.
Character development scripted so well.
I'm fond of the 20's and dirty 30's style.
Fans of vintage cars will be enraptured. Costuming, outstanding.
Regional accents.
Dialogue.
Near perfect.
Really enjoyed the mood of this film.
Homeless people. Wealth. 80 plus years ago mirroring today's world.

Fast paced quick editing to convey the nervousness of our two main characters for taking on this job. But it felt like too much. If it was used in more moderation and not every scene I would've found an appreciation for it.
This movie does a great job of mistifying the infamous Bonnie and Clyde, while also shining light on those responsible for stopping them.

310,jens-andree,Surprisingly good film on every front!,9,6 April 2019,"Trying to make an ""as accurate as possible whilst trying to maintain artistic flair"" movie is never going to be easy and when you take on a story like Bonny and Clyde, where the murderous criminals are given a romantic cult status, it just became a lot harder...The story, or saga as some would call it, of Bonny and Clyde is something we all have heard in one shape or form. Some called them real Robin Hoods whereas those with open eyes saw them for the murderers they were, but in a time of financial hardships in the 1930's America people probably sought alternate heroes?This movie isn't about a romantic depiction of Bonny and Clyde - this is about the men who were sent to stop them, or more precisely kill them. It's their story - and it's being told very well!Casting Kevin Costner and Woody Harrelson as Frank Hamer and Maney Gault, and Kathy Bates as governor Ma Ferguson, were all great choices and they gave the movie a solid base of real character but the supporting cast were equally well picked and William Sadler as Henry Barrow, the father of Clyde Barrow, made a really strong, but short, insight into what it must have been to be torn between the family and the law.Historical dramas often gets stuck in love stories that takes away the focus and this was handled very well in The Highwaymen by reducing Bonny and Clyde to murderous subhumans and instead let the people affected by their fame and killing spree telling the story. This worked really well and both the script and the direction here was really well executed and when the 132 minutes was up and the end credits begun rolling I was only asking for more! Just a few minutes more...Regardless if you are into history or not this is a movie really worth watching - and proof that Netflix productions are on par with the rest of Hollywood, only faster to screen!",The Highwaymen

The laughable plot line that they capture Frank Hamer in the original was pure HollywoodThis iteration of Bonnie and Clyde tells the story from the law's point of view. Two retired Texas Rangers are tasked with stopping Bonnie and Clyde's rain of terror, and what follows is a tail of how they use their years of experience to track and kill Bonnie and Clyde. Costner and Harrelson are excellent in their portrayal of Hamer and Gault. It always amazes me how the truth of storys such as Bonnie and Clyde are always more satisfying than the fictional renderings we usually get.

The acting is phenomenal, Woody and Costner have a great chemistry and are phenomenal for the roles they were cast in. The movie has a super tight script, and it's easy to get lost in the film, which is so lacking in modern cinema. I never felt like the movie was being cliche, and I never felt like the movie was trying to manipulate my emotions through cheese. All of the emotions were conveyed super effectively.

316,Diogo_Verde,Interesting shift from the typical Bonnie and Clyde movie,6,1 April 2019,"Like I wrote in the title, it's a different prespective from the typical Bonnie and Clyde movie. This time, we follow the prespective of the policeman that were put in charge to hunt the couple down. This was one of those movies in which it looks good on paper but then the execution wasn't all that great in my opinion. Of course Costner and Harrelson were great as always but the story itself suffered from pacing issues, draggin on and on forever. The movie could have been cut short 20-30 minutes and it could be much better.Also, I know that this is supposed to be focused on the policeman that were on the tail of Bonnie and Clyde but I think they could have given a little bit more screen-time to the couple. In the end when things unfold I didn't care about them one bit because they were treated as complete strangers, characteres in the distance in which at no point you get to know what's going on their minds.In short: clever concept, boring one-sided movie.",The Highwaymen

If these same people had made a presence before their heroes death then maybe the banks would not have continued to take from the communities where hard working people tried to gain the fruits of their labor. Not long before this era of time trikes by workers were rampant, and most readers would have a hard time to grasp the turn out of those events. Child labor laws, the creation of the FDA to curtail how grotesque working conditions permitted over worked members of those businesses to loose fingers thus the need to list ingredients for products. It was, and has been a time for people to stand up to another when seen what that business owner would do for money. Today, the need for workers to stand up toothier neighbors who own businesses, the need for communities to stand up to the banks. It may very well be a point in time where not only did these citizens mourned Bonnies and Clydes death, but may mourned their lack of doing something themselves to alleviate these problems instead of moralize a select few who did stand up to these horrible forces. You see this in the movie, like a lost soul chasing the the very people who tried to inspire us to take a stand. Kevin Coster passed his partner's home at the start because he did not want him to be involved in this shoot and ask no real questions of what is really happening. Meanwhile gun makers I am sure have bragged about the caliber of their bullet used to take down Bonnie, along with the name of their brand. Police have put up on a pedestal the ranger's work here for others to follow with out question, and the town has continued to forget any continuity, forget any cause for them to be alarmed about the condition of their future, and continued calling which has been ignored and replaced by distractions, and alcohol instead of clear headedness to articulate their problem.

It was terrible how they have been glamorized over the years. They had no regard for human life and actually enjoyed what they did.According to most of what I have read regarding these murdering thieves, this movie was basically historically accurate. Although a few of the main players were not really given their due. There is only so much time allotted I suppose.This was a really great movie. I was glued to the screen. For a movie that is over 2 hours, it actually moved along quickly.Kostner and Harrelson were superb. Both of them were very sympathetic characters. Maybe Harrelson a bit more.Seeing how two men who had the same professional experiences were each affected so differently makes this movie worth watching.The supporting cast was top notch. You only see Bonnie and Clyde for a very few minutes.The cinematography was beautiful. Watching how law enforcement handled such a huge case in the 1930s was interesting.

The scenes of poverty, the migrant camp, reminded me of Grapes of Wrath. House and farm foreclosures were decimating a significant segment of the populace. No wonder that these bank robbers and killers were viewed as heroes by those feeling the worst effects of that era. As the gas station attendant says, ""they're just robbing the banks that have been robbing us poor folks.""I have always liked Costner, and he plays his part well a la Gary Cooper as the legendary Texas Ranger Frank Hamer. As for Harrelson, I've never taken to him since he left Cheers for the big screen.

But there's so much more to this movie: technically, one of the best made movies I've seen in a long time. Directing, scenography, cinematography, editing, camera, costumes, I dare you to find the weak spot in this movie from the technical point of view.
The screenplay is amazingly accurate, and it follows the true story to the tee, never falling into the trap of glamourizing either side, as the previous versions did. It's also remarkable in emphasizing our mad obsession with marginal characters whose only claim to fame was their notoriety, stupidity or both.
This is the movie that describes the best why I love this art form so much. Good movie, and a good book, when finished, leave you with the lingering feeling of involvement, the trace of dialog, scene, passage that refuses to be forgotten for a long time.

348,heddlu,interesting if a little slow,8,7 April 2019,"Watched it last week without knowing what it was beforehand. Great acting by Costner and Harrelson especially the former who really didn't see as 'its Kevin Costner'. Pace at at times was a little slow and of course few actual direct confrontations between the protagonists and their quarry. B and C are portrayed as more or less faceless ciphers which i understand in the context of the film as its not meant to be a sympathy contest between them and the cops..lol at some of the reviews where people appear to be expecting another B and C film. There is also i note the one joke review by the person who is angry with C and H for portraying roles that support the police. Silly billy..yes the 1930s were unequal but killing policemen is the way to protest...that 35000 people went to the funerals just shows that like the number of people who support Trump, there are plenty of silly people about then as now",The Highwaymen

350,MagicSlim,The Story from the Other Side,8,31 March 2019,"Why did no one ever think to bring these two actors together before? What a superb combination. Costner plays his grumpy old with the hardened skin and the sentimental interior, Woody is Woody. Partners from way back that tolerate each others annoying habits and behaviours they spend three months, seemingly living in cars tracking the two criminals who are only ever shown in fleeting half glimpses.
One has a real sense of time passing, the waiting , the staking out, the false leads, the incompetence of corrupted local police and public who saw them as heroes rising up against the machine that caused the great depression. All the while a pervading cloud of dirt and grinding Grapes of Wrath poverty.
Amazing attention to detail adds to the atmosphere.
This attracted poor initial reviews as my guess is that most were expecting what the trailer suggested; a shoot em up police procedural. Its a study of the time, culture and the grinding pursuit of two of America's high ranking public enemies",The Highwaymen

Sure, it's ok to embellish the story for entertainment sake but this movie almost puts you in the car with Frank Hamer as he chases Bonnie and Clyde.I truly appreciated the cinematography, cars, buildings, landscape and overall visual representation of this film. It just seemed to give you a really good feel what it was like to live in the early 30's, without the embellishment factor. It was a tough time to live, tough time to look for work, and a tough time to enjoy life. Bonnie and Clyde made a mockery of the time by taking their life on the run, but Frank Hamer and his partner Maney Gault take you on an epic journey throughout the Midwest in search for the most infamous couple of all time.",The Highwaymen

It makes me very suspicious.This movie takes two fantastic actors, a decent director and serves us up a very boring framed nothingness.Costner and Harrelson mumble their lines to the point that you can't understand them - why?What was the point in keeping Bonnie and Clyde from view virtually the whole movie, to the point that we're just not invested in the climactic scene of their demise.Kathy Bates is so underused its criminal - the standout performance.Netflix seem to think that gathering talent and throwing money at it, will make a good movie. It doesn't. Triple Frontier a case in point, another hot mess.There isn't any suspense build-up in a true story that should have ample opportunity to do so. A waste of a true story.The lines are completely forgettable and the set-ups make no sense.One ridiculous scene has our protagonists get the villains in their sights in a car chase, only for B&C to drives rings around heroes on a dry dusty patch of land, driving up so much dust that they get away in the dust cloud. Wtf!Don't believe the other reviews, this is at best a 3, but considering the cast and budget they should be deducted stars for ruining a great story. It's just damn slow and boring, without any payoff. Avoid.",The Highwaymen

363,StonedCrow,"Not BAD as such, but definitely an underwhelming slow-burn",5,19 May 2019,"This movie requires real involvement and will to stick-it-through and is not something one can relax somewhat brainlessly to on a lazy afternoon and expect to remain interested and entertained; even given the famous subject matter and simple plot.In terms of performances and costumes/sets etc. it is indeed evocative of the 30's depression era and the ""public enemy"" period, but choosing to be more of a character study of the old detectives as they pursue the outlaws actually slows the film to an almost interminable pace at times, and it honestly suffers as a result. The tedium sets in pretty early. Or at least it did for me.I simply cannot be sure how many of the 9's and 10's here are genuine; or, if they are real accounts, what criteria they actually use to rate a film, as in no conceivable world should this picture be scoring a 9 or even 10/10. No way.Unless you have a particular interest in the history and events of the period, and/or one of the two leads, there are far better films to while away the time with. This one was well-made and watchable, but was over-long and oh-so-slow at times.Average at best for me: 5/10",The Highwaymen

It was thoroughly entertaining watching them work together to hunt down two of the most infamous criminals. The handling of Bonney and Clyde was amazing, portraying them as seemingly immortal ghosts, just how people thought of them in real life, until the very end when we look them in the eye and see that they were very real human beings. It is a little long and has its dry moments but in the end, Costner and Harrelson deliver great performances and if you have Netflix, it's definitely worth the watch.",The Highwaymen

You never really get to see any of bonnie and Clyde until they're full of bullets (sorry about the spoiler). Watching a thriller without seeing the bad guys was like watching a football game when you only get to see one of the teams... the tension never really built, I was never really engaged. Surprisingly (to me at least) I didn't really find the combination of harrelson and Costner delivered much tho I did have a few flashbacks to Costner as Elliot Ness in the Untouchables which is a much much much better movie.

A refreshing alternative to the romanticizing classic from the 60s. The notorious couple were animals, psychopathic killers who murdered without prejudice and as such had given up their right to live. I absolutely love the character of Frank Hamer and Costner is so good at portraying the accounts of his real-life counterpart.The movie has faults; the chemistry between Costner and Harrelson's characters comes off as rather stilted and the truth is stretched a bit at the end. In reality, the accounts from the posse that brought the duo down heavily contradict eachother so some liberty had to be taken in the portrayal.

In contrast, the much hallowed Beatty-Dunaway Bonnie and Clyde version the critics compare The Highwaymen with ad nauseam, contains crass misrepresentations of the facts.

When Lee Simmons offers Hamer the job, he says it's to put Bonnie and Clyde ""on the spot."" In those days and in that context, that meant ""set them up to be killed."" So even if you didn't know what really happened, this would have told you.
Hamer's attitude toward them is shown in what I think is the best line in the movie, when he shows the Dallas deputy how Bonnie rolled the wounded copper over onto his back ""so he could see what was coming,"" then says, ""The kids you grew up with aren't human anymore."" The movie is really a study of the relationship between Frank Hamer and Maney Gault, and the two actors are fantastic. And the ending? Well, someone who knew the true story once said, ""Bonnie and Clyde were psychopathic pieces of ____, and the only bad thing about them getting killed was, it didn't happen soon enough."" (Oh wait, that was me that said that.)
I give it 9 stars, mainly for not glorifying the psychopaths. It would have 10, except that some of the things depicted (the dusty car chase, for one) didn't really happen.
(Another nice touch: Ma Ferguson (who in real life became governor when her husband died before he could be sent to prison) originally calling Hamer and Gault washed-up anachronisms, then telling the press she knew they would get the job done. ""That's why I chose them."" Typical politician.)",The Highwaymen

The atmosphere feels authentic and immersive and the pacing is great--the quiet periods add to the gravitas and suspense and the action is truly terrifying. So much about this slice of the Depression brings to mind the economic and political times of today--the unescapable misery of people without jobs or hope, the deluded idolization of heroes who are completely undeserving, the manipulation of public perception by the unscrupulous to advance an agenda. Last, but far from least, violence is not glorified here. The protagonists are expert at it and are survivors, but we are given an unflinching look at the toll it has taken on them.

The only reason people have any interest in this story is because of the two criminals everyone was after, yet almost no effort was made to attract the interest of the viewer, although they went out of their way to show how the two were cult heroes...

The story was true to its facts and it's a breath of fresh air to see things from a law perspective. Woody Harrelson has now played the roll of a cop and a modern day Clyde in ""Natural Born Killer"" in the story telling of ""Bonnie and Clyde"". To me it's impressive and shows his acting skills due to the fact that he did both so well. Apart from that, Kevin Costner did a remarkable job.

The scenes that were put in just to try and make it more interesting than factual were glaringly obvious. Some of the acting, from mainly the co stars, was wooden and poor. The film seemed to jump to scenarios without explaining why they were there. Why were they so grumpy and miserable at the end?...they knew what they had set out to do! They de-glamourised Bonnie and Clyde by not letting you see too much of them but also made it obvious that people idolised them.

So my expectations before starting to watch the Highwaymen were set quite low, although Woody and Kevin were listed as the leadroles. In this film we get to see the, until now, untold ""lawenforcing side"" of the Bonnie and Clyde drama until the very end. I was stunned from the very beginning by the details in the film and by how visually beautiful the film was(ie no arty farty director enforcing bleached colours or deviating aspect ratios just to get ""that special thirties feeling"".

Many of the shots and camera angles used were executed perfectly. Overall with Harrelson and Costner's performance, as well as a few unrealistic scenes strictly to make the movie interesting (such as the chase scene through the dirt and the car they were pursuing just vanishes), this movie is a must-watch for anyone looking for an amazing crime film from the perspective of law enforcement.",The Highwaymen
428,isaknordmanrid,suprisingly good!,7,19 July 2021,"When I first saw this movie in my netfllix feed I was seriously doubtful whether to watch it or not. Woody Harrelson as a tough cop, it felt like it had already been done before (just as Scorsese already had made great gangster movies before the Irishman). However this movie seriously suprised me with it's original approach and it's immacular approach.First off I have to give credit to the main protagonists. . Both characters have clear motivation for their actions. Hamer (Costner) takes the job as he feels that it is his duty to save the lives of the guards and policemen that intervene with the psychopathic Bonnie and Clyde. Gault (Harrelson) seeks purpose and dignity as he lives retired with his daughter. While Gault is humoristic and sympathic, Hamer is serious and violent (good cop bad cop yes I know). This creates an intersesting dynamic between the two of them which constantly makes the scenes interesting. In the middle of the film, further depth is added to the characters as Hamer starts to question what makes a man a man, while Gault is starting to doubt who decides what is right and wrong. At the end, we see that the carters have developed, but still being true to their former self. Hamer starts trusting his companion and Gault overcomes his inner dilemma. Both Costner and Harrelson act flawlessly, doing the roles they know best but with a twist.The second thing I loved about this movie is the themes it brings up, and the way they are presented. Most movies tend to shove one big theme up your face with a clear sensmoral. This movie however delicatly asks questions that eventually turn into the themes of the movie. Who decides what is right and what is wrong? What are you supposed to do when you feel that the world is running past you? Why do we become who we are? What gives a man the right to take someones life? None of these questions are really answered, but the movie presents us several possible answers and lets the viewer decide for himself.The third thing i liked about this movie was the cinematographic style. The whole movie is moving slowly. There are long cuts hardly feeding the viewer any plot or information, with just a car driving. However, this gives the movie a more realistic feeling. I can imagine that it is what a manhunt would've been; long hours in the car, eating and sleeping badly, no communication with the outside world. Also, there are hardly any action scenes in the movie. And in the action scenes, violenece isn't glorified but instead portrayed raw and brutal.With that being said the movie has some flaws. Sometimes it's hard to follow the hunt as we don't get enough insight into the mind of Hamer. We just don't know what his plan to catch the outlaw couple. Also, it can be hard to realize the situation and the challenge of catching Bonnie and Clyde if you are not familiar with the story. I just believe that they deserve just a little more introduction as they are who they are (although I loved that the movie din't accidently shift focus from the cops to the outlaws).Well, this review has become far too long, but I think it's safe to call this movie underrated.",The Highwaymen

With no supernatural mumbo jumbo the villians seems so powerful and frightening ,,even the Protagonists are shown very powerful and equipped but one feels a real sense of fright and uncertainity that normal fqolks would have experiecnced if this was a real situation for them.

Two aged, recommissioned(or, actually half-recommissioned) Texas Rangers take on Bonny and Clyde and hunt them in the end using same tactics that B&C used to kill lawmen. The tempo is slow at the beginning and builds up gradually until the climax. The sedate style of storytelling is intentional to give it a more realistic feel. The director Mr. Hancock achieves that masterfully! Set-design is excellent! Camerawork follows the happenings from the perspective of Pancho and Manny, and you get a clear idea of what they are facing while dealing with such criminals. There are some intense moments that will keep you on the edges of your seats!
Finally, the acting. Superb! A plus straightaway! The screen chemistry of Costner and Harrelson works like magic, and their banter wont let you feel that you are actually watching a hunting party involving some deep criminals.

While not in their prime physical condition and no real support from the powers that be, their characters' experience and tenacity would lead to a successful conclusion to their hunt for Bonnie and Clyde.Some may not like the slow pace of the movie, but it truly matched the time. They didn't have the resources that law enforcement has now. What these Rangers had was experience and instinct for the hunt.It is shocking how this crime duo had a fan club and I was truly horrified at the end as people threw themselves at the dead bodies of Bonnie and Clyde.

477,danmaltby,Basically the tale of Robin Hood told from the side of the Sherrif on Nottingham.,9,31 March 2019,"Kevin and Woody do a great job as Manny Gault and Frank Hammer, and Bonnie and Clyde look more like the real outlaws than any other movie . You can tell Kevin Costner researched the way Hammer smoked a cigarette and walked, and by the middle of the movie I was totally believing this was Frank Hammer Texas ranger and not Dances with Wolf guy, The 2 of them have chemistry together and are a good team.Ok so now what bothered me was watching the screenwriter do a TV interview about how he did all this research and bla bla bla . In the end at the ambush Frank Hammer and Manny Gault come out and say ""stick em up"", as giving Bonnie and Clyde a chance to surrender. I just don't know why they decided to drop the ball on what could of been a much more suspenseful scene. As the outlaw Ford V8 pulled up, there was incredible tension, Hammer did intend to give them a chance to surrender with a hands up. In the tension of the moment Bienville Parish Sherrif deputy Prentiss Oakley broke under the strain and suspense of having one the biggest outlaw in the country 20 feet away from him. Oakley stood up and fired a rapid 5 round burst with his Remington Model 8 .35 caliber hitting Clyde square in front of the left ear.Before the mass cacophony of the 150 bullets Clyde was already dead, and Bonnie was one second talking to Ivy Methvin and the next her lover and protector was gone in an instant, his head exploding. The other 5 officers started blasting , and Bonnie let out a scream like a wildcat. The movie did a good job showing how after all the Laws emptied their high power rifles and BAR's they ran after the car with shotgun blasts and their revolvers. Frank Hammer than walked right up to the passenger side of the car, leaned in and shot Bonnie right in the face. To me right there truth is so much cooler than fiction, and I can't believe there was no one to suggest this to the director and producer. Perhaps out of respect for the lawmen families the film portrays that the officers gave them a chance to give up. I dunno but it could of been a lot cooler to show that suspense of the moment, which the movie kind of does, but it could of been a lot cooler showing how Pretnis Oakley broke under the strain and stood up and shot Clyde square in side of his head, blowing the back fo his head off. To me it was almost comical watching Prentis Oakley delegated to using a Thompson .45, when in real life there wa no Thompson used, the low velocity .handgun cartridge .45 of the Thompson was not the tool for the job. Am I nitpicking ?In fact of you look at the actual death car pic, there are like 25 bulletholes in the windshield in front of Bonnie and only few in front of Clyde. I also could not understand why the movie said that Bonnie and Clyde shot a gas station attendant in the head for $1 worth of gas, it just didn't happen. Clyde did shoot a guy to attempt to steal his car on Christmas morning, he did it trying to get away. so I mean he was dirt bag, I just don't see the need to alter history when it's cooler than fiction.Finally one very cool thing about the movie that I did like was the films choice to focus the movie about the lawmen side of the tale we all know. It's basically the tale of Robinhood told from the side of the Sherrif on Nottingham.",The Highwaymen

The characterisation of Hamer and Gault (Costner and Harrelson) was superb. They play two deeply flawed individuals who have an unerring sense of purpose. The locations, understated score and the lack of glamourisation worked extremely well. It was the best acting from Costner I have seen. As for Harrelson he is a superb actor and produces a an equally excellent performance. I would recommend this film wholeheartedly. Bear in mind it's a slow burner.",The Highwaymen
479,swankliving,A Third Rate TV Re-Make,1,30 March 2019,First rate stars saddled with a third rate script and production not worth the time on the Hallmark Channel. It's a sad waste of talent by actors deserving of a far better vehicle.,The Highwaymen
480,redswanvintage,I thought honest movie making was dead!!,10,12 April 2019,"This is a very good, pretty fairly historically accurate film ( my husband is completely one of those folks that points out historical inaccuracies, and only did so twice). I really appreciated the fact that you never got a good look at Bonnie and Clyde. These people were sensationalized criminals, not heroes. Read up on hammer's life; that is a true American legend!",The Highwaymen
481,jchaddavis,Fun story,4,16 October 2019,"This is a fun movie. Unfortunately, it holds little correlation with the events it's supposed to represent and, even more unfortunately, it has the wooden-acting Costner playing a role of a man who was 20 years younger than he was during filming. This should be considered a completely fabricated story that happens to share some names with historical figures and not an attempt to portray historical events.",The Highwaymen
482,bran_clem,6.9 is definitely underrated!!,8,18 January 2020,"Using IMDB for over 5 years and this is my first movie review, I definitely think the only reason for the reviews being so low is beacause it's such a long slow burning film, Harrelson and Costner are a great pair and you truly believe they have had a long past together, you truly believe they are 2 horse riding cowboys in 1934, and the whole setting for the time period is spot on, feels similar to Hell or High Water with the Texas feel, this movie was better then I was expecting and definitely give it a solid 8!",The Highwaymen
483,brownhd,The untold story of Bonnie and Clyde,10,11 April 2019,"This movie is superb, with great acting and the recreation of the 1930s era. I had never heard the story of the 2 Texas Rangers that tracted down the duo and brought them to justice.",The Highwaymen
484,pharmalibra,Beautifully done.,9,8 April 2019,Every detail was done perfectly. The story might have dragged were it not for genius performances by Harrelson and Costner. I wouldn't change a thing.,The Highwaymen
485,vlpqpthyjx,"Very, very good movie with historical touches",10,17 April 2019,"I once went to the very spot where Bonnie and Clyde were killed. And though the road is now paved, what they showed in this movie was very accurate. Even drove to Dallas to see their graves. So if like me, you are interested in history, this is your movie. Excellent acting, great suspense, very well done by Woody and Kevin. Highly recommend.",The Highwaymen
