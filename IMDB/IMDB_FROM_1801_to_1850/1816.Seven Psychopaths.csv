0,TheLittleSongbird,Seven psychopaths that one doesn't want to mess with,7,14 February 2018,"With such a talented cast and being so impressed by 2008's 'In Bruges' and the recent 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri', hopes were high for 'Seven Psychopaths' despite its severely wanting marketing. A large part of me really enjoyed it on the whole, but there are a few misses and part of me was disappointed. It is director Martin McDonagh's weakest film of the three feature films he directed, but that is comparing it to 'In Bruges' and 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' and that it is still good if patchy is testament to how good (if also divisive and imperfect) those films are. It is very easy to see why people would be underwhelmed by 'Seven Psychopaths', not just for its unevenness but LAO for its unsubtle, very violent, very foul-mouthed nature and lack of political correctness, just as much as it is easy to see why others will enjoy it. 'Seven Psychopaths' has a good deal to like. It's very gritty and stylish visually, with the editing succinct and not choppy, perfect for the genre and what it's lampooning and challenging. The soundtrack is both catchy and atmospheric and McDonagh's direction is consistently assured. Much of the script hits more than it misses. Although lacking in the emotion of 'In Bruges' and especially 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri', the dark comedy often ranges from very funny to hilarious and there is also moral complexity, very clever and razor sharp wit, lampooning, lambasting and subversion of all the genre clichés and how the script should play out. The violence is unsettling but not too gratuitous and the story is deliberate yet gripping. There are memorable scenes, especially Sam Rockwell's dream shoot-out scene, a comedic delight if there ever was one. Regarding the performances, Rockwell is great fun, and seems to be having a whale of a time, and Christopher Walken oozes charisma. Woody Harrelson is also great. There are drawbacks here in 'Seven Psychopaths'. There are patchy parts in the script, where the wit slackens and the writing becomes too conventional and even for what it's poking fun at (the genre clichés) it does get too clichéd.Especially misfiring is how the female roles are written, although intended to mock how they're written and used is not very tasteful (can sort of see where the misogyny complaints come from) and they are so under-utilised that it gives the female cast very little to do.Colin Farrell is nowhere near as good as he was in 'In Bruges'. The character is very bland and uninteresting, and Farrell just doesn't have the charisma of Walken, the likeability of Harrelson or the comic timing of Rockwell to pull the character off or make much of him. The ending is both contrived and abrupt, very true of McDonagh's other two films as well and indicative that ideas had run out.Overall, good and enjoyable but uneven. 6.5/10 Bethany Cox",Seven Psychopaths
1,Leofwine_draca,Violent black comedy let down by unappealing characters,5,20 December 2015,"I'm not really a fan of this genre of film, which consists of horrible characters doing horrible things to each other, but SEVEN PSYCHOPATHS is worth a look due to the unusual aspects of the storyline. Given that the protagonist is a scriptwriter there's a whole lot of self-referencing going on here which gives it a very post-modern feel a la SCREAM.The story is complete nonsense of course, involving the hunt for a stolen shih tzu and the owner's increasingly desperate - not to mention deranged - attempts to get it back. The draw is that all of the main cast members are, you guessed it, psychopaths, although there's also a lot of shaggy dog storytelling going on too so you're never quite sure what's what.The main flaw of this film lies in the unlikeable characters. Colin Farrell's lead is a real bore and reminded me how I find it really easy to dislike Farrell when he's given the wrong role. Sam Rockwell spends the whole of the running time hamming things up, and it's left to Christopher Walken and Woody Harrelson in support to make the best of things. I've noticed that director Martin McDonagh is very good at shooting action and movement scenes (as with IN BRUGES and SIX SHOOTER) but as a writer he still needs to work on a few basics, such as crafting likable protagonists.",Seven Psychopaths
2,SnoopyStyle,"Crazy cast, Crazy story.... Kinda blah",6,8 September 2013,"Marty (Colin Farrell) is a struggling alcoholic screenwriter who's working on a book called Seven Psychopaths. His friend Billy (Sam Rockwell) is a professional dognapper and he desperately wants to help write Marty's book. His other friend Hans (Christopher Walken) has a deep dark secret. Billy's latest dognapping involve gangster kingpin Charlie (Woody Harrelson) which sets off a whole series of killings.It's a deliberately convoluted story. Colin Farrell oddly is playing the straight man. But considering the crazy cast, one can see he's actually the most normal. Sam Rockwell completely overwhelms with his manic energy. When Christopher Walken gets together with Colin and Sam, there are a couple of great exchanges. But those exchanges are fleeting and far apart. The fact is that this was way too convoluted to be compelling. And the ending really doesn't help it any.",Seven Psychopaths
3,Prismark10,Adaptation,5,4 September 2016,"From the opening scenes we know that we are in Tarantino territory. It is about low rent gangsters, hit-men, weirdos and a screenwriter. Up to a point it is smart, hip, funny and violent and then like some of recent Tarantino's works it is all talk as the director Martin McDonagh flips the movie as they get all meta and talk about adapting a film about psychopaths.Marty (Colin Farrell) is wannabee boozy filmmaker in LA. He spends his time with Billy (Sam Rockwell) a dog thief who alongside cravat wearing older criminal (Christopher Walken) steals dogs and returns them when the dog owner puts up a reward. However they all end up in trouble when the y steal a Shih Tzu owned by a gangster called Charlie (Woody Harrelson.) Billy is already making out with Charlie's estranged girlfriend and it all ends up with a messy shootout in the desert.In the meantime you hear stories of killers who go after serial killers, a man who stalked the killer of his daughter to hell and a strange Vietnamese priest.Farrell is the straight man among these swirl of strange characters. The women in the film are one note and bullet fodder which the movie itself notes but it gets lost in the second half and the film fizzles out.",Seven Psychopaths
4,claudio_carvalho,"Pretentious, Overrated and Boring, 27 April 2013",4,14 May 2013,"In Los Angeles, the alcoholic Irish screenplay writer Marty (Colin Farrell) lives with his girlfriend Kaya (Abbie Cornish) and is writing the screenplay of a story about seven psychopaths. His best friend Billy (Sam Rockwell), who helps Marty to develop the profile of psychopaths, kidnaps dogs for the veteran smalltime crook Hans (Christopher Walken) that returns the animal to the owner to receive the reward. When Billy kidnaps the beloved Shih Tzu that is the pride and joy of the powerful gangster Charlie (Woody Harrelson), he hunts Hans down and kills his wife Myra (Linda Bright Clay) in the hospital. Soon Marty learns that the psychopaths described by Billy are not fictional.""Seven Psychopaths"" pretentious, overrated and boring movie about an alcoholic Irish writer that is writing about psychopaths and finds that is surrounded by them. The plot was supposed to be a combination of comedy with crime, but it does not work well and I laughed only in a couple of scenes. Maybe with Guy Ritchie in the direction, ""Seven Psychopaths"" might have worked, but unfortunately Martin McDonagh does not repeat the good work of ""In Bruges"" and the movie sucks. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""Sete Psicopatas e um Shih Tzu"" (""Seven Psychopaths and one Shih Tzu"")",Seven Psychopaths
5,kosmasp,Comedy Psychopath Club,9,3 June 2013,"Though it's members do not have a membership card. It's not even about a mystery or two (I'm guessing most will see through one of the ""major"" twists), but about the performances. Great actors and great comedy melt together in a violent mix that will obviously not be to everyones taste of course. But if you like your comedy not to hold back punches and be as dark as it can be ... well look no further.Sam Rockwell, but also Colin Farell deliver great performances. Especially the latter seems at home playing more coy and shy than ever! Of course as mentioned there will be blood. And if you are not into watching that on screen, than you better stay clear. Everyone else should at least rent it. It's worth your money",Seven Psychopaths
6,classicsoncall,"""And what do you think we should do in real life?""",10,10 February 2013,"""Seven Psychopaths"" has a better ring to it, but shouldn't this have been called ""Six Psychopaths""? The Jack of Diamomds after all was just Billy with a red mask providing inspiration for Marty's screenplay, so he was double counted. I have a way around this though if you consider Billy's narration of the movie ending in which Marty joins the psychos to go up against Charlie Costello's gang in the imaginary shootout. Can you even believe I'm trying to analyze this? I have to say, I watched this three times in order to capture the full nuance of what was going on with the characters. Each time Sam Rockwell was more hilarious than the last as dog-napper in chief and Marty's best friend. The whole concept here was pretty far out there, but this kind of quirky stuff, if well done, will always get my attention.Now I'm not saying any of this was believable at all, but there was one sit up and take notice moment when the Vietnamese priest returned to his village after the war. For anyone born after the mid-Sixties with no knowledge of the Vietnam conflict, the scene won't carry any significance, so my intent by mentioning it is for you to go look it up. The historical reference to My Lai was an unusual inclusion for the story and had me going back in time to those days when the war was raging.You know what's kind of odd? I'm looking at the credits for the film here on the IMDb and Harry Dean Stanton is listed as the 'Man in hat'. Why not credit him as 'The Quaker'? Just wondering.Anyway, I thought the four main players were standout, with Rockwell the best as I mentioned. Harrelson has a knack of getting these wacko roles, and if Christopher Walken wasn't included in this bunch I would have wondered why. The one thing about Colin Farrell that distracted me though was his going in and out of the thick Irish brogue; I wonder why that was. Otherwise his conflicted writer character was a pretty good foil for Billy's witty sarcasms and generally insane observations. The only thing now as I think about Billy, the movie didn't really end his way after all.",Seven Psychopaths
7,Tweekums,A black comedy which some will find hilarious others will find offensive,8,14 April 2018,"As this film opens a couple of killers discuss a hit they are preparing for; then a man approaches from behind and shoots each of them before placing a Jack of Hearts on each body. We then cut to struggling screen writer Marty. He is working on a screenplay titled 'Seven Psychopaths' and his friend Billy is helping him by providing various anecdotes he might use... he also posts an advert in the paper inviting psychopaths to tell Marty their stories. That is the least of their worries though; Billy has stolen a dog belonging to psychotic gangster Charlie's beloved pet Shih Tzu. Charlie will do anything to get it back and that means killing anybody close to the person who took it. As the story continues it is clear that the things that happen will provide Marty with his story... assuming he can survive of course.This black comedy certainly won't be for everybody; it is violent, sometimes very violent and the language is stronger than I expected in a '15' certificate film. If you can get past this though it is very funny. The way the various anecdotes tie in to the main story is well done and not too obvious. The four main characters were a lot of fun; Colin Farrell impresses as Marty, a man clearly out of his depth; Sam Rockwell puts in a fine performance as Billy, a character who is more than a little disturbed and Christopher Walken is great as Hans, a peaceful character with a past. There is also a solid performance from Woody Harrelson as antagonist Charlie. There are plenty of laughs to be had but also some real shocks; especially in the scene where we learn the identity of the 'Jack of Diamonds' psychopath. Overall I enjoyed this although perhaps not quite as much as writer/director Martin McDonagh's 'In Bruges'... I'd certainly recommend it to anybody who enjoyed that film.",Seven Psychopaths
8,paul_haakonsen,Caught up in psychosis...,5,13 January 2013,"With an impressive cast as there was to this movie, I had definitely thought something more of this movie than it turned out to be. The movie was sort of boring at times and tended to drag on. But at the same time, there were some really great moments to it as well.The actors in the movie did good jobs with their given roles, and there was some pretty good names to the cast list. However, the story just didn't really sink in well with me and had that much appeal.""Seven Psychopaths"" is a movie unlike your average Hollywood movie, because it is quite unique, and its story does have a great many levels to it. So it is somewhat of an acquired taste. Personally, it just didn't work out that well for me.It is the type of movie that you need to really pay attention to the storyline, because it tend to jump around between storytelling and actual in-movie events. So keep your wits about you as you sit down to watch the movie. This movie turned out to be a rather blend and mediocre experience for me, despite its fantastic cast list.",Seven Psychopaths
9,LeonLouisRicci,Extremely Unsatisfying,4,17 April 2013,"What a cast! What a disappointment! This is another of those ultra-hip, ultra-violent, ultra-wacky, and ultimately unsatisfying attempt at Coolness that has had its day and is as unwelcome as another bad burger.Tarantino. There it is said. So many others seem to want to say it as though this is some sort of forced attachment to excellence. It doesn't fly. This is an all too familiar Film with such forced humor and a failed attempt at violent parody that it is rendered lifeless and unattractive to the...wait for it...Extreme.It is relentlessly confusing and frustrating in its layered lay out of characterization and subplots that it is completely lost before it is even aware that it is missing. The worst example being the Buddhist Monk bit that runs throughout and ends it all by running amok with a ridiculous explanation of how to include it in the fictional Screenplay after it is abandon in the ""real"" fictional Screenplay.After all, this is an overrated mess of meanderings and half-realized self parody that is a cold and impenetrable interplay of much ado about nothing that is engaging and ends up being a disconnected series of Players and events it tries so cleverly to connect that its break from reality is its own conceit.",Seven Psychopaths
10,zardoz-13,A Violent Art Movie About Homicide,5,18 July 2018,"Writer & director Martin McDonagh goes off on a tangent in his serio-comic thriller ""Seven Psychopaths,"" about an alcohol screenwriter who has difficulties penning a screenplay about killers. Colin Farrell plays Marty, a scribe suffering from writer's block and Marty's best friend Billy (Sam Rockwell of ""The Green Mile"") pleads with him to help write his screenplay. Billy takes out an advertisement in the newspaper for psychopaths to visit Marty and relate their sordid stories. Meantime, Rockwell's best friend Hans (Oscar winner Christopher Walken of ""The Deer Hunter"") have been kidnapping dogs and returning them to their owners after a few days. Typically, the canine owners are so gratified that they pay Hans. This doesn't turn out to be the case with Charlie (Woody Harrelson of ""Natural Born Killers"") who threatens to kill anybody that abducts his dog. Basically, Charlie spends his entire time searching for the dog kidnappers, while Marty struggles to complete his screenplay. ""Seven Psychopaths"" goes off on tangents, some rewarding and others not so rewarding. The story about the Quaker father of a butchered daughter is unforgettable. A killer reforms himself, proves to prison officials that he has been rehabilitated, and gets released from prison. This doesn't stop the revenge hungry Quaker from stalking him. The killer has converted to Catholicism and plans to slice his throat open with a cutthroat razor. Much to his chagrin, the killer watches as the Quaker brandishes his own cutthroat razor and slashes his own throat. Clearly an art film with its many weird characters and confrontations, ""Seven Psychopaths"" won't be everybody's cup of tea, despite its distinguished cast.",Seven Psychopaths
11,grantss,Silly and dull,4,4 December 2015,"Silly and dull. From the start it just goes nowhere. Writer and director Martin McDonagh tries too hard to be clever and quirky, and it just comes off as absurd.Casting demonstrates just how try-hard the production is. Every main character is played by an A-lister: Sam Rockwell, Colin Farrell, Woody Harrelson, Christopher Walken. Many of the minor characters are played by stars: Tom Waits, Olga Kurylenko, Michael Stuhlbarg, Michael Pitt, Abie Cornish, Harry Dean Stanton. None of them put a foot wrong, but are hamstrung by the plot (especially) and direction.",Seven Psychopaths
12,george.schmidt,Warped pitch black comedy ; A hoot and a holler definitely worth checking out,9,11 November 2012,"SEVEN PSYCHOPATHS (2012) *** 1/2 Colin Farrell, Sam Rockwell, Woody Harrelson, Christopher Walken, Tom Waits, Abbie Cornish, Linda Bright Clay, Harry Dean Stanton, Kevin Corrigan, Gabourey Sidibe, Zeljko Ivanek, Olga Kurylenko, Long Nguyen, Christine Marzano, Brendan Sexton III, Amanda Mason Warren, Michael Pitt, Michael Stuhlberg. Warped pitch black comedy about a struggling alcoholic LA screenwriter (Farrell playing the straight man) and his two odd friends/dognappers-by-day (Rockwell getting his ya-yas out and Walken well come on, he's the man!) who find themselves in the crosshairs of a wronged/crazed thug (Harrleson) when they kidnap his beloved Shih Tzu and suffer the consequences, while the trio attempt to cobble a screenplay about the titular criminal lunatics. Funny as hell and at times graphically violent mix ala Tarantino with game, lively acting by its principals each apparently outdoing one another in being off-beat (not an easy chore) including song man Waits as a killer-of-serial killers and bunny petter and a fun cameo by Stanton as a grave Quaker out for revenge. Written and directed by Martin McDonagh (who collaborated with Farrell on IN BRUGES) with tongue-thru- cheek gashed by a razor crassness. A hoot and a holler definitely worth checking out.",Seven Psychopaths
13,view_and_review,No Straight Jackets Needed,7,18 March 2016,"""Seven Psychopaths"" was a different kind of movie. It was a bit nutty and a bit cooky as can be expected from a movie called ""Seven Psychopaths"". I had one expectation and was given something else. Not bad, just different.With Woody Harrelson in it playing a gangster named Charlie and the title, I began thinking of ""Natural Born Killers."" I had thoughts of seven people doing insane things just because their minds work differently than everyone else. Well, there were seven psychopaths but they weren't what you'd expect.The title comes from a self-same project being written by the main character, Marty (Colin Farrell). He's working on the Seven Psychopaths screenplay and he's having a hard time even coming up with the seven psychopaths. He gets plenty of help from his conveniently nutso friend, Billy (Sam Rockwell) and Hans (Christopher Walken).The movie seems pretty random at first then it starts to gain focus. There's dognapping, killing of mobsters, screen writing and visiting a cancer patient. All of these events are part of a story that comes together in which the fictional world somewhat bleeds over to the real world.",Seven Psychopaths
14,neil-476,Enoyable in an odd sort of way,7,19 December 2012,"Would-be screenwriter Marty has a title - Seven Psychopaths - but nothing else. His friend Billy is taken with the idea and draws Marty into contact with a number of psychopaths via his interesting business of covert kidnapping dogs and returning them to their owners for reward having pretended to find them. However, you need to be careful not to kidnap the wrong person's dog.Writer/director Martin McDonagh, who gave us the brilliant violent and profane black comedy In Bruges, revisits violent, profane and black comedy, but in a story which is considerably dafter than his previous offering. To be frank, much of it is a bit of a mess and it certainly doesn't stand up to close examination. But for all that, I liked it quite a lot. Colin Farrell's Marty is something of an innocent abroad, and Sam Rockwell's Billy is suitably manic: these two drive the thing along nicely, aided by Woody Harrelson as a murderous dog owner and a wonderful turn from Christopher Walken, full of humour, light, edge and heart. I think you have to put your critical faculties to one side a bit, and just enjoy it for what it is - a daft, violent, rambling, funny romp.",Seven Psychopaths
15,ferguson-6,A Flare Gun at the Final Shootout,7,13 October 2012,"Greetings again from the darkness. When a writer/director sets a standard with a film like In Bruges, the anticipation for the follow-up is palpable. Martin McDonagh is a writer first, and a self-taught filmmaker second. He again shows his talent for interesting characters in unusual situations, and an extraordinary blend of black comedy, violence and personal struggles with morality.This film is a smart (but dark) comedy about characters who aren't nearly as smart as they see themselves. It's quite self-referential and at its best is a self-parody. Colin Farrell plays a writer who is blocked with the perfect title ... Seven Psychopaths. Sam Rockwell plays his best friend who runs a crafty little dog-napping business and feeds Farrell possible story lines. He even goes as far as to run an ad asking real life psychopaths to come tell their story. Yep, this plan is just running smoothly until Rockwell kidnaps the dog of a local gangster played by Woody Harrelson.What we quickly figure out is that we are watching Farrell's writing process unfold on screen. The bigger challenge is trying to figure out what is really happening and what is fantasy or part of the creative process. The writing and acting are very skillful. Christopher Walken plays Rockwell's partner and delivers what may be his best performance in years. It's very offbeat and irregular ... in other words, typical Walken.The script pokes fun at the weak female characters - Abbie Cornish as Farrell's girlfriend, and former Bond girl Olga Kurylenko as Harrelson's less-than-loyal girlfriend. The film also features some of my favorite character actors. In addition to Walken, we get the great Tom Waits as a bunny loving psychopath, Harry Dean Stanton as a Quaker, Zeljko Ivanek as a henchman, and an opening scene with Boardwalk Empire alums Michael Pitt and Michael Stuhlbarg.As wonderful a writer as McDonagh is, we can't help notice the influences of Quentin Tarantino and the spaghetti westerns - especially The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. His comedic tendencies wrapped in violent sequences really challenge us as viewers. Trying to find the good in those who aren't necessarily so good adds an element and complexity as the film throws violence in our face as the characters are confronting their deeper feelings on morality. McDonagh continues to be one of the most intriguing and talented filmmakers working, and even though this one is a tick below his last one, I anxiously await his next.",Seven Psychopaths
16,FlashCallahan,One eyed guy.....,7,24 January 2013,"A struggling screenwriter inadvertently becomes entangled in the Los Angeles criminal underworld after his oddball friends kidnap a gangster's beloved Shih Tzu....After the wonderful In Bruges, Martin McDonagh had something to contend with in his follow up. and while the movie is funny and very clever in some aspects, sometimes it's almost too clever for it's own good and becomes a little pretentious.Farrel again is amazing as the lead, and it proves that after a little absence from the big screen, he is still brilliant, despite the quality of the film he's in.And it's strange, because he's the most normal character in the film, and this is the other films weak point. The bizarreness of characters has become tiresome of late, and the novelty has worn off something rotten.Fifteen years ago, if this was released, the poster would have adorned every students wall, and the film would have become a cult icon, and lines would be quoted forever and a day.But it's 2013, and irony and referencing is an everyday thing, so Sam Rockwell screeching and Woody Harrelson crying about a dog, just doesn't cut it anymore.The script is good, and some of the sub characters really grip, Cornish and Waits are two prime examples, but are hardly in it.If you are expecting a Tarantino type movie, with blistering dialogue and conversation, this way over stretched the mark.But if you want to see something a little kooky that reminded you of being a student during the nineties, seek this out and enjoy the nostalgia.",Seven Psychopaths
17,gradyharp,'I don't have a drinking problem. I just like drinking.',10,22 December 2013,"Writer/director Martin McDonagh ('In Bruges') has done it again – created a comedy out of a tale about killing. He pulls this off with a smart script and with a cast of actors that simply could not be improved upon. Once it starts it doesn't stop - not even at the end of the film when the absurdities just keep flying.Chronically drunk Irish screenwriter Martin (Colin Farrell) has serious writer's block to the point that his drunken diatribes result in the loss of his girl Kaya (Abbie Cornish) and draws him closer to his best friend and wannabe writer Billy (Sam Rockwell – never better and in fact the true star of this film!). Martin is struggling to write a screenplay called 'Seven Psychopaths' and Billy helps him find the characters to reference: crazy old bunny carrying Zachariah (Tom Waits) who shares his youthful killing spree with his wife (Amanda Warren), Cop Charlie (Woody Harrelson) and his sidekick Paulo (Zeljko Ivanek) out looking for Charlie's kidnapped Shih Tzu blamed on an innocent Sharice (Gabourey Sidibe), but actually dognapped by Hans (Christopher Waken) to support his hospitalized wife (Linda Bright Clay – in a terrific cameo), a strange old man (Harry Dean Stanton) who slices his own throat, a loony Vietnamese priest (Long Nguyen) and other equally psychopathic characters. There is bona fide madness within and without every character and the manner in which McDonagh makes it all play out is a feat of cinematic genius. In the end Martin realizes that madness is reality and finishes his film - with a severe twist at the end.Carter Burwell is responsible for the imaginative musical score, even borrowing a supply gorgeous passage, 'Premiers transports que nui n'oblie' from Berlioz' Roméo et Juliette performed by The Monteverdi Choir & Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique with Catherine Robbin, Jean-Paul Fouchécourt & John Eliot Gardiner (for those curious as to which recording was borrowed!). Every aspect of this crazy, zany, madcap, hilarious adventure somehow works. Comedy is king in McDonagh's hands. Grady Harp, December 13",Seven Psychopaths

Colin Farrell plays a struggling screenwriter who gets caught up in his buddy, Sam Rockwell's, hair-brained dog-kidnapping scheme.

One of these dogs, a cute little shih-tzu named Bonnie, turns out to be mobster Woody Harrelson's beloved pet, and all three of the guys get marked for death. The screenplay is so far from conventional that you never know quite where it's going. Sure, it doesn't always work, but it's always hugely entertaining. Everyone's great in it, particularly Walken and Rockwell. As with In Bruges, the film was an enormous flop, but I suspect, also like In Bruges, it will win a following once it hits video.",Seven Psychopaths
19,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Seven Psychopaths,10,13 January 2013,"With Seven Psychopaths, writer-director Martin McDonagh proved to be no flash in the pan with his well received In Bruges, reuniting with lead actor Colin Farrell in movie that the trailer didn't manage to show off its brilliance. This is something that deserves to be watched, pronto, with fantastic stories to tell of its characters, and has drama, comedy and action all rolled into one, presented in a manner that perhaps even Tarantino would be hard pressed to follow.It's extremely self-referential and self-deprecating at times even, with McDonagh as the writer breathing life into one of three leading protagonists in Colin Farrell's Marty, a screenwriter facing a writer's block in trying to flesh out his latest idea revolving around seven psychopaths. Keen to help is best pal Billy (Sam Rockwell), an bit actor who's finding it more lucrative to be in the dog-kidnapping business together with their associate Hans (Christopher Walken), and provides Marty with directions and ideas to who the other titular psychopaths could be in his screenplay.Which allows McDonagh to run riot with the various fantastical elements involving gun- slinging, battles, revenge, religion, and just about every noir and exploitation elements that he can think of. These little episodes of flash backs, or references, proved to be hits in taking the audience out of the present, and embracing these episodes as exaggerated tales spun out of real world references in the lives of the story-teller, protagonists or antagonists. There's a Jack of Hearts serial Killer with a penchant of leaving behind his calling card, inspired by real world incidents, an Amish parish out for vengeance on the killer who did the unthinkable to his daughter, a violent Bonnie and Clyde styled tag-team, and a Viet Cong out to seek revenge in the soil of the US, involving explosives, a hooker, and some crazy communication jokes.All these centered around Billy dog-kidnapping Bonny, a shih tzu belonging to chief mobster Charlie (Woody Harrelson), and here's where all hell breaks loose. The violent nature of Charlie, usually involving shooting people without remorse so long as he can get his gun to work, trails the trio of Marty, Billy and Hans, inflicting personal damage as he gets closer to retrieving his dog. Here's where McDonagh's writing shines, in creating memorable characters put into memorable episodes with even more memorable dialogue to move the story forward. The conversations between characters are rapid fire, containing a wealth of information, anecdotes, and black comedy that will fly by extremely fast, making it well worth a second viewing.What more, McDonagh ups the ante by making this extremely self-referential, almost coming close to parodying itself toward the closing stages, primed with graphic star-gazing into what could have been a ridiculously hilarious gun-blazing finale that has to be seen to be believed. Colin Farrell clearly got outshone by his co-stars, probably also because their characters were more flamboyant compared to his relatively muted one. Sam Rockwell is fast becoming a character actor to sit up and take note of if you hadn't already, tackling what would be a multi-faceted role as Billy, playing off the charisma of Christopher Walken really well, with the latter's character adding some soul to the film, with more than one gripping scene in the movie when he stood up against those out to get him.What you can infer from the trailers and promotional material hardly scratched the surface of McDonagh's wonderful and brilliantly played out film, with its self-deprecating undertones and veiled criticisms, complete with sharp and snappy lines delivered by characters that you'd surprisingly care about, no matter how small their role are. Even McDonagh's own acknowledgment of his inability to craft strong female characters got a comical mention as well. A definite early shoo-in as one of the highlights of the year thus far, so whatever you do, don't miss this!",Seven Psychopaths
20,siderite,"Refreshing writing, good acting, a bit silly, but I liked it",8,4 October 2013,"Judging by the name and the trailer, I thought this was going to be a silly comedy with weird people that we are supposed to laugh about to make us feel superior. This almost made me not watch the film; that would have been a mistake. It is by no means a masterpiece, but the script is delicious and the acting great: it is refreshing and the comedy is truly amusing while based on serious situations.The biggest value of the movie is the plot, while its worst flaw is a tendency to have caricaturesque characters (Woody Harrelson comes to mind, as the ruthless gangster who only has affection for his dog and would do anything for it). It is good to see Colin Farrell in a movie with an actual story for a change, even if I didn't feel his character was very challenging. Or maybe it was that Farrell can easily play an alcoholic Irish writer :). OK, being unnecessarily mean. Sam Rockwell pretty much defined the movie.Another miss of the film is the complete lack of meaningful female roles. It is basically a tale of men that never got to grow up, girls have no place in it. That didn't bother me much and it was a movie about psychopaths, which are preponderantly male, but still, I find that stronger female roles usually complement the male ones and the story. As such, it all felt a little bit one sided and therefore slightly surreal.Bottom line is that I enjoyed watching the movie, even if I can't quite place the exact quality that made me feel that, other than the very imaginative script.

22,StevePulaski,Another title of piercing accuracy,8,14 October 2012,"Let's get the insane plot of Seven Psychopaths out of the way: Marty (Collin Farrell) is a struggling Irish screenwriter, who hopes to finish his screenplay for a film called ""Seven Psychopaths,"" while battling a case of writer's block and author-indecisiveness. His best friend is Billy (Sam Rockwell), a boisterous dog-thief, who usually winds up dictating Marty's life rather than helping him along in tough times. Hans (Christopher Walken) is Billy's best friend and partner in crime when it comes to dog-snatching. After both Hans and Billy steal an unpredictable crime boss's (Woody Harrelson) shih-ztu, it becomes a violent, relentless cat-and-mouse chase to get the pup back, and in the meantime, we get lengthy monologues between characters about the production of ""Seven Psychopaths"" and how Marty's inspiration begins to bubble when he starts considering the barrage of real psychopaths in his own life.There are several films that exist about the movie-making process and it is a very difficult genre to make effectively. Seven Psychopaths succeeds in balancing the art of characters and the art of plot coherency, and it doesn't cross the line of becoming too involved in the process and too concerned with ""in"" jokes that leave the audience lost. To put it simply; the actors look like they're having fun, but they make sure we are still amused and connected with the film.Right off the bat, the first thing one can commend about this entire experience are the rich performances by actors of all different career heights. Collin Farrell plays a wonderful straight-laced man victim to idiocy and unhelpful circumstances, and is only made better by Sam Rockwell's character's shameless belligerence. Woody Harrelson, giving us one of his many diverse roles in recent years, has the rare ability of rustling up a fierce moment of seriousness and delivering a devilishly funny laugh in the same breath. And who could forget supporting-role king Christopher Walken, who continuously borders the line of self-parody here in a memorably sophisticated role? At times, Seven Psychopaths is a witty riot and at other times, it can be monotonous and lengthy. For starters, the film looks and feels like a Quentin Tarantino film blended with the likes of Guy Ritchie. Shots have a very slim sense of narrative cohesion and many, many times are we left bewildered at what we just watched. It's also apparent that the film has a meta, self-aware tone that can be pleasantly charming, and sometimes cloying and overly-cheeky. To simply my feelings; after many sequences was I trying to comprehend what was just given to me and how was I supposed to digest the experience all together.I mentioned my feelings that the film seemed to drag and felt a little too long - specifically the final scene in the desert which is roughly twenty-five to thirty minutes. Perhaps if your interest is in cheeky comedies and self-aware humor, you won't mind at all. The film is certainly smarter and a lot brighter than some of the flyweight, narrow-minded comic exercises that have bestowed on the mainstream public in recent years. For once, it's refreshing to see a comedy pay close attention to its characters, its events, and its performance, never shortchanging anyone in the process.NOTE: There's also something very, very different about the cinematography of this picture, different from any kind of visual atmosphere I have seen this year. The southern California area seems to be captured through a grungy, saturated lens with colors appearing bright, humid, and very warm. This easily makes Seven Psychopaths one of the most visually calm pictures of the year.Starring: Colin Farrell, Sam Rockwell, Woody Harrelson, Christopher Walken, Tom Waits, Abbie Cornish, and Olga Kurylenko.

It centers in L.A. and it involves a screenwriter's plan to do a movie around the L.A. criminal underworld. This film features an all star cast of of well known folks like Sam Rockwell, Colin Farrell, Abbie Cornish, the veteran Christopher Walken, and the also wonderful Woody Harrelson the cast chemistry is well done as the film moves along just fine with it's violence and funny parts, and wild story of wanting to make a movie about the L.A. criminal underworld.

24,KineticSeoul,Not that funny but quirky and entertaining,8,3 November 2012,"So this movie is about a guy named Marty(Colin Farrell) trying to write a novel but isn't all that creative. So he starts by just coming up with a title for his novel which is ""Seven Psychopaths"" and things keeps getting added on from there from ideas to real life. Maybe that is how this movie was made, it's a possibility. And his two good friends Billy(Sam Rockwell) and Hans(Christoph Walkens) who are in a dog kidnapping business gets involved. Same Rockwell being the best and most entertaining psychopath in this movie, but Christoph Walkens is good as well...I mean it's Christoph Walkens. It's kinda clever how it makes ideas and what really happens intertwine in this and just about every character is coherent to the story. Also although some parts can be predictable but it goes it can go in a unexpected direction in a good way. I didn't think this movie was all that funny but it has some intriguing black humor and it's quirky. Overall the whole movie works and the whole cast works, although the direction isn't straightforward it works as well. The less you know about this movie the better. The trailer didn't really explain this movie and for good reasons. This is a quirky and entertaining movie that hardly has any moments that drag.8.3/10",Seven Psychopaths
25,Hellmant,Packed with offbeat characters and twistedly clever dialogue!,8,16 January 2013,"'SEVEN PSYCHOPATHS': Four Stars (Out of Five) Writer/Director Martin McDonagh's sophomore feature film effort (after 2008's excellent 'IN BRUGES'). Once again he teams with actor Colin Farrell and tells a darkly comedic and violent crime story. This one focuses on a screenwriter writing a feature called 'Seven Psychopaths' who becomes involved with real psychopaths and other criminals when his friend kidnaps a gangster's beloved dog. The movie co-stars Sam Rockwell, Christopher Walken, Woody Harrelson and Tom Waits and is once again packed with offbeat characters and twistedly clever dialogue. I'd say it's at least as impressive as 'IN BRUGES' and doesn't suffer at all from the sophomore jinx.Farrell plays a down on his luck screenwriter by the name of Marty Faranan. Rockwell plays a struggling actor by the name of Billy Bickle, who is also Marty's best friend and desperately wants to help him write his screenplay 'Seven Psychopaths'. Billy makes a living by kidnapping people's dogs and then returning them to collect the reward money. His dognapping partner is a religious man by the name of Hans Kieslowski (Walken). Hans has a secret past and a wife, named Myra (Linda Bright Clay), who's sick with cancer. When Billy steals the Shih Tzu of a ruthless gangster named Charlie Costello (Harrelson) he puts himself and his friends in a lot of danger from the psycho and his thugs. Things are also complicated by an add Charlie placed for real-life psychos to share their stories with Marty (as ideas for his film).The movie got rave reviews and there was even talk that McDonagh's genius screenplay would likely get an Oscar nomination. There was also hopes that Sam Rockwell's hilarious and brilliant performance would land him a supporting actor nod. Neither of those things happened but Rockwell and the script are that good. Rockwell probably is the scene stealer of the movie but the rest of the cast is all impressive as well (especially Walken). McDonagh's directing is stylish and quirky and perhaps not as cool as his writing but his Tarantino-esque filmmaking style (as a whole) definitely pays off.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE8W7gz6XHo",Seven Psychopaths
26,thesar-2,Unlucky Number Seven,4,11 May 2013,"While trying a little too hard to be Adaptation, Pulp Fiction, The Usual Suspects, True Romance, Very Bad Things, Lucky Number Slevin and Did I Leave Any Else Out?, Seven Psychopaths was a somewhat enjoyable piece that I wouldn't want to see again.Maybe it's because I'm not at all a fan of Sam Rockwell or maybe it's because the movie was all over the place and the direction of the film was unfocused enough that I found myself caring less and less about the main characters thrown around like Kino balls. Aside from my initial statement of all the movies it mimicked, it was somewhat original in its take on a writer's blocked screenplay creator and his wacky, well, psychotic friends. Butthat didn't make it highly enjoyable.Alcoholic Billy is struggling to write his next big screenplay and is using the stories of his pals far too closely to write ""Seven Psychopaths."" Along his journey of fleshing out the stated seven, he gets thrust into the incredibly bloody and cruel criminal world and the quest for retaining one's dog. (I would find that silly, but then the movie really isn't to be taken seriously, anyways.)The movie's funny at parts, I will admit, and mostly from Woody Harrelson's doofus of a leader role and from the sad and tired dreamer Christopher Walken plays. And though some scenes were literally laugh-out-loud, such as the imagination of how the movie should end by the campfire and the end credit scene, overall, I think it was trying too hard to be insider-Hollywood and be far too tongue-in-cheek for its own good.No doubt the movie was well shot, contained good cinematography and a decent, though forgettable, soundtrack and score. I can't comment on the predictability, for they told you – LITERALLY – how this will play out, so much so, it might as well been called ___ Dies at the End.I appreciate a movie so much more when it tries to be its own invention and not relying on so many movies (just a handful off the top of my head is in the first paragraph) to take after. And though this may be another Love-it or Hate-it feature to a lot of folks, I'm neither. My opinion: eh – could've been worse and a whole lot better.",Seven Psychopaths

28,Robert_duder,A comedy so dark that its black and feels like its lacking direction,5,17 February 2013,"Granted, I have never been a huge fan of this type of comedy. I've never seen Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, or Snatch or the like minded comedies like this one that people compare it to. I just know I saw a trailer, loved the diverse cast and it seemed like a quirky little comedy. It delivers on that front. It is quirky and it does have some very, very, very dark comedy. The cast is incredibly diverse and performances range from good to very good but the story sadly drags significantly in the middle. It feels like it has too many ideas all at once and then ambles along in each direction before reminding you of the other direction suddenly. Flashbacks, flash-forwards, day dreams...all make the story feel a little confusing at times. But I have no doubt that this film will find its niche with certain audiences. It is the type of movie that becomes a cult classic before it is even finished and not blatantly so. It doesn't feel like they're purposely trying to make it that type of movie which is good. The ridiculous Quentin Tarantino-esque violence only adds to the entire feel of the film. It is gritty and incredibly gratuitous in every way so it will find an audience in that respect too. The biggest issue is how much it drags getting to the point.It's hard to talk about everyone in this film so I'll keep it to the main characters. First of all Sam Rockwell is pretty near manically brilliant in his role. He is all over the place as a hyper disturbed psychopath. He speaks so quickly and is so vibrant in his role that he almost carries the movie. Colin Farrell also does a good job in a subtle quiet role for him. He's like the straight man to everyone's manic characters in the movie. Farrell and Rockwell play off of each other so well that they have the best chemistry in the film. Christopher Walken is...well Christopher Walken and I mean that in the best possible way. He is just out and out himself without being over the top or overly dramatic. He has some good lines and some great scenes and he is perfect in his part. Certainly some of the best scenes are those with the three of them together. Who better to play a raving insane madman mobster than Woody Harrelson? He does what he does very well. Considering how vital his character is and how obvious his involvement is to a movie aptly titled, they don't use him as much as I would have thought. The supporting cast are all very familiar faces for the most part and they do well enough in small roles.I can admit that the film has a distinctive artistic quality. I'm sure a film student could dissect this movie and list a dozen reasons why its ""brilliant."" It feels like that kind of movie. It is smart and its well written but I think poorly edited for the mainstream crowd. I don't consider myself an idiot and I love all types of movies...if you look at my reviews I think you will see I literally will watch just about anything but I really struggled with this. It has a style that I just don't think I completely understand. I won't tell anyone not to watch this or even that it was a bad film. Quite the opposite. It had some really good performances, and was a dark definitive gritty psychotic comedy that would appeal to some. For me, I thought it was far too long and too complex with too many story arcs that don't feel quite complete hence my rating. Bizarre at times, ambles along and perhaps too quirky for its own good. 5.5/10",Seven Psychopaths
29,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Just not up to the standard set by In Bruges, a big disappointment",4,19 May 2013,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningMarty (Colin Farrell) is a struggling screen writer, who can't seem to get his screenplay 'Seven Psychopaths' finished. He isn't getting much help from his dimwit friends Billy (Sam Rockwell) and Hans (Christopher Walken), who kidnap dogs, then return them to the owners to collect the reward. But things go haywire when they kidnap a mutt belonging to gangster Charlie (Woody Harrelson.)Five years on, In Bruges is still hailed as one of the great, cult comedy films of recent times, Martin McDonaugh's sharp, witty comedy caper earning him an undying recognition among film connoissuers, with it's sparkling dialogue and intelligent screenplay. So four years on, this reunion with lead star Colin Farrell would be best approached not with the hope of repeating that success, but hopefully just being a comic cracker all on it's own. McDonaugh has undoubtedly given himself a set up with enormous potential and the capability for things to work. Sadly, this time round he's gone and made a right pig's ear of it.Somehow, the film's tone and sense of cohesion feel wrong and it's lost your interest about half an hour in. McDonaugh displays the same disregard for political correctness and boundaries that he did in IB, perhaps even pushing the boat out even further here with shock value and dark, taboo subject matter, outrageously presented in a tongue in cheek style, but without a decent story to guide it, it fails to live up to the IB standard. I have said the film shouldn't be compared too much to that film and just be viewed in it's own right, but inevitably parallels will be drawn and they're not good. By the end, it's just become one long bore, that doesn't even have the decency (but certainly the self indulgence) to finish as the end credits roll.The cast aren't to blame, each respective player from Farrell to Walken doing their thing reliably enough, it's just the style and tone of the story, that maybe thinks too much of itself and tries to be too much while alienating it's target audience. It's just one big, sad disappointment, one I really wanted to love but just left me cold. **",Seven Psychopaths
30,bowmanblue,"A slow burner, but worth the wait",8,18 March 2015,"I deliberately didn't watch any trailers for Seven Psychopaths. I wanted to see it fresh, choosing to watch it on 'star-power' alone. I pretty much guessed that it was going to be a very black comedy, filled with more than one or two murders.I have to say that when I came to watch it, I was quite disappointed. It wasn't as funny as I thought it would be and it wasn't as violent. The first half seemed to jump around from one character to the next with little to no direction. I have to confess that my attention waned more than once. However, I persevered and I was actually glad I did.In the second half the story really seemed to come together. I won't go into too much detail as it does rather pride itself on deliberately not doing what some might call the 'classic Hollywood narrative.' Having finally got round to watching it, I would say that it wasn't the film that I thought it would be, but it's definitely one I'd watch again.Colin Farrell may be the star, but I'm afraid it's Sam Rockwell who steals the show when it comes to the 'psycho' element and Christopher Walken who is the 'heart' of the movie.",Seven Psychopaths
31,dromasca,the magic of 'seven' does not fully work,5,27 August 2016,"There is a magic about the number 'seven' in cinema among other places. Some say it started with Snow White, other will mention Kurosawa. Fact is that many successful films used this magic and succeeded, some of them succeeded great. So when we get this number in the title, when we see on the poster a cast that would make any blockbuster in Hollywood, and when we know that the script and directing belongs to the exquisite drama writer Martin McDonagh whose appearances as a film maker are scarce but special, and whose previous film In Bruges was smart and funny, the expectations for Seven Psychopaths run high.What we get is a 'film in film' formula of a special kind. A scriptwriter in Hollywood seeks inspiration for his next film in stories about psychopaths. He starts collecting them, and the stories start happening around him. His best friend is building a revenue stream from kidnapping dogs and returning them to their owners for happy dog reunion awards. Murders and horrors multiply in the script and around, and the border between real and fiction is never clear. The formula is not completely new, Hollywood loves stories about Hollywood, and screen heroes have more than once crossed the line of separation between screens and viewing halls (Woody Allen, Charlie Kaufman, etc.). The tone here is crazy, with reverence to the older and newer horror movies, but also to Tarantino.The execution is less fun that it could be. Martin McDonagh is a smart script writer, but as a director he seems to be too much in love with his own script. Something is missing, maybe the cynical look or the extremes that make Tarantino's violence on screen entertainment. Out of the good cast I especially liked the performance of Christopher Walken, while Colin Farrell, Sam Rockwell, and Woody Harrelson deliver as expected. Overall 'Seven Psychopaths' makes true only part of the promises of number 7.",Seven Psychopaths
32,g-bodyl,Brilliantly Funny!,9,27 March 2014,"Seven Psychopaths, the second feature film of Martin McDonaugh's In Bruges, is a brilliant and often witty film. It features many laughs and some gleeful, over-the-top violence. It has a great cast and undoubtedly, it's one of the greatest films of 2012. I liked how this film makes fun of Hollywood. Throughout the film, you can see the possible disdain the filmmakers have for this giant corporation.McDonaugh's film is about a struggling screenwriter named Marty and his best friend named Billy who is willing to help his friend. He and his partner-in-crime, Hans also steals dogs for a living. When they accidentally steal the dog of a violent gangster, things may possibly go down.This film has wonderful acting and everyone definitely had a good time with the film. Colin Farrell is supposed to have the lead role, but he actually is in the back seat compared to the performances of Sam Rockwell and Christopher Walken. Rockwell is gleefully over-the-top and Walken delivers his best show in years. Of course, I must mention Woody Harrelson because he also does one heck of a job.Overall, Seven Psychopaths is a brilliant film for many reasons. It's an entertaining and rather funny film. It's violent and not scared to show some blood. It pokes fun at Hollywood and films that do that always receive points in my book. Plus it's witty and original. One of the better films of 2012.

38,Rodrigo_Amaro,"Lost in translation, McDonagh loses in style and quality, rises with a great cast and gains with a morbid humor (off-putting at times). Good film but not great.",7,1 November 2013,"The talk of the town about this movie exaggerates everything about it. ""Seven Psychopaths"" is good but not great. It has a stellar cast, part of it delivering their usual good routines, others are breaking barriers and exceeding themselves and a minority is reduced to expendable scenes. But I heard amazing, genial, spectacular, original. Those rhapsodic feelings I didn't get but I find it funny, amusing, with peaks of inspiration and calculated dialogs that made this a wildly pleasurable movie, and a little something to remember. Story: the life of aspiring screenwriter Marty (Colin Farrell) is turned upside down when a touchy gangster (Woody Harrelson) starts to chase him after the disappearance of his beloved Shih Tzu, taken by one of Marty's friend, the problematic Billy (Sam Rockwell, perfect), who along with his partner (Christopher Walken) pretend to find missing dogs and receive money as reward. Parallel to those problems, Marty is writing an innovative script entitled ""Seven Psychopaths"", a movie that deals with those title characters and is surprisingly conceived to not feature any shootout at the ending. Confusion and deaths arise.Previous film from director Martin McDonagh was a small film that went big, the clever and hilarious ""In Bruges"", an outstanding movie with some of the same qualities present here but classier, less dark and different. It was something unique. Of course I have to compare with ""In Bruges""; if let alone it makes things even worse for this other movie which seems to use elements from Tarantino films but without knowing how to combine humor with violent scenes, and without referencing pop culture and/or more obscure references. Those who want to watch this because it's a comedy are gonna be disappointed. The humor is deeply hidden, in between cringe-worthy scenes, most of the time very effective and funny but it's more twisted than laughable. But there's smart moves in there: a right jab at the MPAA board members in the scene where Billy says ""you can't let animals die in a movie, only the women"", the director/writer response to those lunatics who found offensive that the original script included a bad ending for the dog but they didn't complain about the women being shot.Like some of Quentin's works, this one almost falls into vacuums. What's the point? Well, I saw a story about a friendship tested to crazy and absurd limits, almost a love story between Marty and Billy; and the unconditional love we have, whether the object of such is another person or a dog. In between, there's the killings, stories within another stories, like the one involving Tom Waits character's past - less would be more in that part, that excessive flashback almost destroyed the whole movie, which are not gonna be part of Marty's script. The cast, at least the ones who were decently cast, is great. Too bad we didn't have much of Michael Pitt and Michael Stuhlbarg; and the story was careless enough to not have one worthy female role, so Abbie Cornish and Olga Kurylenko are there for almost nothing. Farrell is far from the brilliant role he had in ""In Bruges""; but Rockwell and Walken always steal the show, and Harrelson was fine as well. At the end of the day it's awkwardly entertaining and has plenty of amusing moments, creative exchanges (""No shootout?"" or the Gandhi was wrong dialog) but it's not that spectacular as the crowd says it is. 7/10",Seven Psychopaths

True there are moments of sharp ""dark comedy"", but they cannot overcome the random storyline, which is of ""made up as you go along"" quality. Walken has the best lines, followed by Harrelson. Harry Dean Stanton is barely in the movie. Somehow the whole is much less than the parts, and it's a shame because if the movie had stuck more to the kidnapped dog, and less to trying to come up with a screenplay, the film would have benefited. - MERK",Seven Psychopaths
40,tomgillespie2002,Will likely leave you scratching your head,6,23 September 2015,"Even though I wasn't blown away by Irish playwright Martin McDonagh's directorial debut, In Bruges (2008), the film contained enough memorable one-liners and great performances to have me anticipating his next feature. In the four years that elapsed between In Bruges and his follow-up Seven Psychopaths, Martin's brother John Michael wrote and directed the offensively hilarious The Guard (2011), and in 2014 gave us Calvary, one of the truly great films of that year. Martin's limelight has been stolen somewhat, and Seven Psychopaths is a slight let-down. It's a movie about movies, or rather a movie within a movie, or even a movie without a movie - either way, it's a bit of a mess.Script-writer Marty (Colin Farrell) has writer's block. He knows what his next movie is going to be called - Seven Psychopaths - but the title is all he has. Struggling with alcoholism, he tries to keep his girlfriend Kaya (Abbie Cornish) happy while his unhinged best friend Billy (Sam Rockwell) tries to worm his way into a writing credit. Looking to avoid creating yet another movie glamorising violence, he wants his psychopaths to retain some humanity and have the message of his movie be about peace and love. Billy suggests he takes inspiration from the 'Jack of Diamonds' killer, who only kills high-ranking mobsters and is currently on a killing spree in Los Angeles, and they take an ad out in the local paper asking for real-life psychopaths to come and tell their story.Billy also kidnaps dogs from rich folk for a living along with his partner-in-crime Hans (Christopher Walken), but they have just stolen a Shih Tzu from the wrong man - gangster and madman Charlie (Woody Harrelson) - a man we first meet trying to fix his gun so he can shoot the young girl who had the dog in her care in the face. Marty has the vaguest of ideas about his other psychopaths - one being a Vietnamese war veteran (Long Nguyen) dressed as a priest looking to avenge his family's murder during the war, and another a quaker (Harry Dean Stanton) who stalks his daughter's killer for decades - but no way of connecting them and one story possibly accidentally stolen. With Charlie on their tail, Marty, Billy and Hans flee to the desert to contemplate their fate and finish the script once and for all.This is an odd film from start to finish. The opening scene depicts two gangster (Michael Stuhlbarg and Michael Pitt) discussing famous murders of people being shot through the eyeball, before being blown away themselves by the masked Jack of Diamonds killer, It's reminiscent of the Tarantino-inspired wave of self-aware crime flicks of the 1990's, where pop-culture references and quirky humour trumped anything dark and serious. The use of freeze-frames to introduce it's collection of psychopaths also reminded me of the 1990's, when Danny Boyle's Trainspotting (1996) opened the floodgates for countless inferior imitators in Britain to do the very same. Are these the kinds of movies McDonagh was offered in the wake of a successful debut and is now satirising them? Or did he just run out of ideas and resort to emulating a now-dated era?I found this the main problem with Seven Psychopaths, and I felt like I could never be sure if McDonagh was being smart, lazy, or both in an ironic clever-clever way. At the half-way point, the film begins to drag and meander as if McDonagh had genuine writer's block (there's a reason the main character is Irish and called Marty) but kept writing in the hope that it would eventually work itself out. But Seven Psychopaths does have moments of inspiration. As Hans, Christopher Walken makes the welcome return to the large roles that seem to have evaded him of late, and delivers a performance of real humanity. The dialogue too, is as quotable and vicious as you would expect from the man who penned In Bruges, with the humour providing a welcome distraction from the barrage of exhaustive violence - and maybe that's the point. But whatever the point, this will more likely leave you scratching your head trying to figure it out.",Seven Psychopaths
41,Thanos_Alfie,Interesting plot...,7,15 January 2019,"""Seven Psychopaths"" is a Crime - Comedy movie in which we watch a screenwriter trying his best in order to write his new story when he inadvertently chased by the worst gangster of Los Angeles after his friend kidnapped the gangster's beloved dog. In his fight of surviving he gets more new ideas about his new story and with the help of a new friend everything starting to seem more clear.I liked this movie very much because it had a very interesting plot with many plot twists and a very good direction. I also enjoyed very much the interpretation of Colin Farrell who played as Marty the struggling screenwriter and I believe that he was simply amazing at his role. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned was Sam Rockwell's who played as Billy and I believe that he was outstanding. Some other nice interpretations were Christopher Walken's who played as Hans and Woody Harrelson's who played as Charlie. Regarding the direction of this movie which was made by Martin McDonagh I have to say that it was very interesting and I liked very much how he connected some very serious events with his movie and the way he presented them.Finally, I would like to say that ""Seven Psychopaths"" is a very interesting movie with a very good plot and equally good direction. I recommend everyone to watch this movie because I am sure that you are going to enjoy it and that you are going to have a lot of fun. If you have already watched ""In Bruges"" and you liked it then this is the next movie you have to watch.",Seven Psychopaths
42,Floated2,A Story within a Story but rather bland,6,19 November 2013,"Considering a lot of praise this film has gotten since it's release, I've decided to see how I would fare for it. Having not watched the trailers since it's release, my memory wasn't the best but what I understood is that it was labeled as a dark comedy. However, on my viewing of Seven Psychopaths, I did not see too much what the fuss was about, and didn't find any of the jokes clever or anything much in it funny. The film has a creative edge and director Martin McDonagh is a gifted writer, but it didn't hit me as some others may felt. We get it, the idea of the movie within the movie becoming the movie we're watching.Going into the film I was expecting more of a psychological thriller with suspense and bits of comedy but it was rather bland and didn't provide the thrills I wanted or the laughs. Once you get in the story it becomes more clear what is to happen. Though it does provide some twists and turns along the way which were needed and some do surprise. The film seemed as if it didn't know if it wanted to be taken serious or silly thus given the audience not sure when to laugh. Either way, taken the film lightly, it wasn't funny (even for a dark comedy). Violence in films is great but I felt that a little much was unnecessary (cut throat scenes, flashback scenes, excessive blood on the walls).The acting is what makes the film passable in my opinion. The cast is solid. Colin Farrel is a steady lead portraying more of himself (not having to give an American accent). I found Sam Rockwell to be irritating and rather annoying. Christopher Walken and Woody Harrelson seal the show giving great performances. I didn't not enjoy too much the final parts as well as the closing ending (the ""Final shootout""). Found it to be rushed, not well executed and more campy than it needed to be. Perhaps this is one of those films that grows on you on multiple viewings.",Seven Psychopaths
43,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Psychotic, hysterical and brilliant in its own way, especially for cinephiles",9,9 October 2012,"In the marketing for ""Seven Psychopaths,"" CBS Films wants you to count  the film's seven stars, but the one real psychopath (and I mean that in  most positive and endearing way possible) that matters is writer and  director Martin McDonagh, whose sophomore film and follow-up to ""In  Bruges"" is a cockeyed stroke of genius.  Sticking with what the marketing tells us, this is a film about a  couple dognappers who steal a mob boss's Shih Tzu and get their friend  and girlfriends wrapped up in the mess. What it doesn't tell you is  that Colin Farrell's character is a screenwriter working on a script  called ""Seven Psychopaths"" and all he has so far is the title. Oh, and  Farrell's character is named Marty.  If you can't tell where this is going, let's just say that ""Seven  Psychopaths"" is one of those films that reserves a special place for  movie junkies and cinephiles. Everyone will find a great deal to laugh  at (especially Sam Rockwell), but only a certain percentage will have a  gleeful appreciation for the meta-narrative at work.  Luckily, you don't have to identify as a film nerd to enjoy ""Seven  Psychopaths."" The film is by no means exclusive or inaccessible, it  just reaches another level of storytelling and maniacal brilliance if  you can make those connections. Beyond that layer, the film offers a  potent combination of semi-gratuitous violence, loony antics and some  stirring poignancy. Throw the meta layer back in, and you have the  equivalent of if Charlie Kaufman's ""Adaptation"" had been directed by  Guy Ritchie.  The film begins with Marty, an alcoholic writer, looking for  inspiration for his seven psychopaths. His first psychopath is inspired  by the Jack of Diamonds Killer, a guy running around Los Angeles  killing off mid-to-high-ranking mob men. Funny then, that his nutty  friend Billy (Rockwell) should happen to steal Bonny, the precious Shih  Tzu belonging to Charlie (Woody Harrelson), a sensitive yet unforgiving  mob boss. Charlie is able to track down Billy's partner, Hans  (Christopher Walken), and the trio is forced to make themselves scarce.  If you're still using the poster to count, then you're probably  wondering about the other three ""psychopaths."" Well, one is a true  psychopath, and that's Zachariah (Tom Waits), who responds to an add  that Billy put in the paper to try and help Marty find more  inspiration. Zachariah has a fascinating story of little consequence to  the film, about how he and his wife decades ago went on a serial killer  killing spree, gorily offing renowned American killers including  Zodiac. His wife left him, however, for getting too soft.  As for the ladies, they have actually no bearing on the movie at all.  Abbie Cornish and Olga Kurylenko amount to wasted talents, which is  only bothersome because of the marketing (or, I suppose, if you're a  hardcore feminist).  The four main players, however, give some of the best turns of their  careers. Rockwell has never been funnier playing his cocky persona.  Billy is so blissfully and purposefully ignorant of reality and never  lacks for surprises. Harrelson, having played many an oddball and many  a hard-ass, effectively blends both in Charlie. But it's Walken who has  one of his best roles in ages. Hans has all his marbles; he's even a  sweetheart, he just plays it abnormally cool in certain situations.  Whereas Marty overreacts to the danger this wild premise brings, Hans  handles it as if he expected it. Consequently, his humorous lines and  moments really cut the tension.  Somehow, McDonagh makes ""Seven Psychopaths"" completely hysterical and  off-the-wall crazy without completely shattering its believability. The  characters, though psychopaths each in their own way, are carefully  grounded and humanized. McDonagh gives them each something we can  connect to emotionally, something we can identify with, in spite of  their irrational quirks. The film occasionally takes some sharp turns  into eye-opening dramatic territory, but it doesn't result in the  jarring tonal nightmare you would expect that to yield from lesser  auteurs.  And there's still this whole other stratosphere that the film enters in  the screenplay within a screenplay context. Marty sets out at the  beginning to write a film about peace and love that features  psychopaths and violence, or something completely oxymoronic to that  affect, and McDonagh finds a way (in his interpretation), to make that  happen.  ""Seven Psychopaths"" seems likely to face a fate similar to ""In Bruges""   not a whole lot of renown amongst the general public, but heaps of  praise from those who ingest films on a regular basis. This one  definitely has more appeal (more stars, set in Los Angeles, etc.), but  both films have similar sensibilities. McDonagh has a real knack for  playing around with clichés and expectations. He twists them around  into something delightfully unexpected that despite seemingly outwardly  silly, is quite meaningful, shocking and doubtlessly entertaining.  ~Steven C",Seven Psychopaths
44,Vartiainen,Off-beat crime comedy,5,31 July 2019,"Seven Psychopaths does not in fact contain seven psychopaths. Well, it does, but not really and it depends heavily on how you count them. Some of the characters are without a doubt psychopaths, while some are... just a bit morally flexible. It's a catchy title for a movie, don't get me wrong, which is why it was chosen, but I can still picture in my head that movie where all seven of the main characters are certified nutsos. Now that movie would have been glorious.Instead we get movie where they're trying to write a movie titled Seven Psychopaths. And if doesn't scream meta to you, I don't know what will. And while we're following this writer, played by Colin Farrell, we get introduced to the so called psychopaths. Some of whom are exactly that, some of whom are just a bit strange and one of whom is in fact Christopher Walken. Which is a whole different story.The style is fast and loose with the rules. There is a narrative, but because the story itself is so meta, it wanders around quite liberally. There are stories within stories, little sideplots that don't really go anywhere - except when they do - and all the characters seem to be in on the joke. Very Guy Ritchie, now that I think about it, especially his earlier films, but not quite as snappy.And while I had fun watching it, I really didn't think I got my money's worth. It's a bit too loose, a bit too scatterbrained. Some of the characters are also annoying and not in a fun way. Farrell is fine and I really liked both Walken and Woody Harrelson, but I also cringed whenever Sam Rockwell's character had a bigger scene. And I have no problem with Rockwell in general. It's just that his character didn't click with me.Not a great experience for me, but I can definitely see how most people would enjoy this particular brand of madness and laughs. I can safely say that if you've liked Guy Ritchie, you should at least give this film a chance.",Seven Psychopaths
45,jtindahouse,Hard to fault,7,25 December 2016,"This is the first Martin McDonagh film I've seen (to be fair he only has one other to date, 'In Bruges' which I now plan to see) and already I can tell that he has a distinctive style that is going to sit well with a lot of people. Much like a Guy Ritchie or a Quentin Tarantino, once he has more films under his belt I believe you will be able to watch a McDonagh movie and know it's his without even being told. Generally most actors thrive under these types of directors, and that is certainly the case here. The whole cast seems completely comfortable with the style of the film and make each and every character their own. Sam Rockwell, who is always a personal favourite of mine, is just in his element here. He's at his best when he's playing crazy, and he's certainly doing that here.The film is a big send up of itself. It never takes itself too seriously and is fully aware of what it is trying to achieve. There's a lot of violence, a lot of bad language and mostly a lot of fun. It's hard to really criticise this movie for anything, because it is so self-aware and so in control of everything. It very similar to a Tarantino movie in that way. It simply comes down to how much you like it. Some will like it more than others undoubtedly, but I think everyone will be able to appreciate it on some level.",Seven Psychopaths
46,Turfseer,McDonagh can't hide his love for hyper-violent action thrillers despite lame attempt at mockery,2,23 January 2013,"'Seven Psychopaths' is by Martin McDonagh, an alleged 'noted' playwright turned screenwriter. A better appellation for Mr. McDonagh, would simply be, 'hack'. One can surmise that McDonagh's 'psychopaths', is an attempt to write some kind of farce or 'black comedy', satirizing hyper-violent action movies. McDonagh fails to grasp the mechanics of farce, in which you're permitted the outrage, without the consequences.One lame example of this, is the exploding head sequence. As it's a scene that's part of a fantasy, the exploding head is outrageous, but without consequences. Hence, it qualifies (barely) as farce. Not so the entirely tasteless scene, where Charlie guns down Hans' cancer-stricken wife, Myra, in the hospital. It's a scene that is outrageous in its cruelty and with consequences--within the context of the story, we have no reason to feel this event is amusing in the least. Han's passive reaction to the murder of his wife is perhaps also supposed to be humorous (in a passive-aggressive way), but I found the entire sequence involving the shooting of Myra, to be completely inappropriate, and indicative of McDonagh's complete misunderstanding as to how to craft a successful satire.The ugliness of McDonagh's humor (reflected in the Myra sequence) is borne out by Mike LaSalle's review in the SF Chronicle. He writes: ""In the end, ""Seven Psychopaths"" is an immersion in ugliness and violence, barely relieved by wit. It's not a comment on an ugly, crazy world, nor is it a response to an ugly, crazy world. It's just ugly all on its own - and not nearly as crazy as it should be."" There's also a sense that McDonagh wants everything, 'both ways'. As much as he seeks to mock the hyper-violent action genre, he is also seduced by it. Kenneth Turan writing in the LA Times senses this: ""Like screen writing Marty, who wants to pen a violent psychopath tale that is also life-affirming, this film wants to deliver genre satisfactions while simultaneously subverting them. It's a difficult maneuver, and ""Seven Psychopaths"" doesn't quite pull it off."" Ann Hornaday in the Washington Post also echoes McDonagh's infatuation with violence: ""But the film also begins to feel like a case of a director getting to revel in the very thing he's reviling."" Kevin Jagernauth, writing in The Playlist, agrees with the 'both ways' theory: ""Boasting lots of gun-play, a big extended cast of stars willing to play along and a less witty, broader sense of humor, McDonagh tries to have it both ways by playing to the cheap seats while pointing out how absurd it is at the same time."" The 'Seven Psychopaths' plot revolves around Colin Farrell's character, Marty Faranan, an alcoholic screenwriter, who suffers from writer's block, and only has gotten as far as composing a title for his next work. Marty's best friend, the unemployed actor Billy Bickle (Sam Rockwell), suggests that he use the 'Jack of Diamonds' serial killer as his Psychopath #1 for the screenplay (it turns out later that Bickle is actually the Jack of Diamonds killer, a murderer who kills other killers). Not all the psychopaths are real life characters; Marty dreams up perhaps the only interesting character in his pantheon of killers--a Quaker who stalks his daughter's killer and in an O'Henry-like twist, drives the killer to suicide, and follows him to hell when he slits his own throat.McDonagh intentionally makes his characters as unlikeable as possible, including Bickle and Hans (Christopher Walken) who steal dogs from their unsuspecting owners, only to return them to collect the reward money. The break into Act II occurs, when Bickle and Hans steal a Shih Tzu that belongs to Charlie Costello (Woody Harrelson), a sadistic gangster, whose bent on retrieving the pooch at any cost.If this isn't enough, Marty's ad in the paper for more psychopaths, brings Zachariah Rigby, who used to go around the country with a girl, Maggie, who he saved after she was imprisoned in a serial killer's basement. In true Tarrantino fashion, the couple are seen in flashbacks, going around the country, hacking the hands off notable serial murderers, including the Zodiac Killer. Zachariah has Marty promise that he'll place a notice in the screen credits at the end of 'Seven Psychopaths', so he may re-unite with the long lost Maggie.The denouement of 'Seven Psychopaths' occurs when Marty, Hans and Bickle drive out to the desert. In a completely absurd scene, Charlie, drives out alone to meet them, carrying only a flare gun. When Bickle shoots Charlie in the back, it looks like it's curtains for him, but in a short amount of time, Charlie reveals it's only a 'flesh wound' and Marty attempts to save him by driving him back to town.I won't go into the ending since by this time, we've long lost caring for any of the characters. McDonagh's idea of humor is to stretch both his characters and situations to the maximum level of absurdity. This strategy backfires, as we soon come to realize that it's not enough to offset McDonagh's guilty pleasure: the love of violence!",Seven Psychopaths

That alone is enough to drawn in film fans and they all have excellent chemistry together. Many of them have excellent comedic timing. It was obvious the actors wanted to work with McDonagh because many of them only had one or two scenes in the film.McDonagh is a skilled wordsmith and Seven Psychopaths' best feature is its dialogue. Combined with the acting Seven Psychopaths has a zip and the banter naturally hilarious. McDonagh is a master at the dark comedy genre and he knows how to make it funny: something other filmmakers forget.Seven Psychopaths has a plot and a style that's similar to the films of Quentin Tarantino, Shane Black and to a lesser extent Guy Ritchie. It matches the tones, quick dialogue and comedy as well as the crime setting and ultra violence. Yet the big weakness of the film is its desire to be meta and self-referential due to Marty's profession. It does learn to fine scenes of violence and action but it does not serve a purpose to the main story.

The only person who realizes what this actor is up to is a Hollywood writer who accidentally gets caught up in the web that is being spun by the actor. As the story proceeds, the psychopathology of all the characters become increasingly apparent, with the actor being the maestro who provokes the others to act. What the actor wants is to go out in a blaze of gun fire. What is never discussed is why the actor is so intent on dying. He is portrayed by Sam Rockwell whose performance is astounding. One soon gets the sense that his character is completely devoid of consciousness and simply wants to meet his needs without the slightest concern for the consequences. To him, acting out is fun. The writer, played with much affect by Colin Farrell, is appalled but can do nothing to stop the actor except to observe and comment on the actor's outrageous behavior. Mr. Rockwell's performance is even more chilling in that he is also engagingly friendly, that is, he is not inherently mean spirited, just bent on acting out. His lack of malice is what makes the story even more interesting. But this comes as no surprise because it's a story about psychopaths, and psychopaths can be charming people too.",Seven Psychopaths
51,meeza,Definitely not on my hit list,5,23 March 2013,"I am all in favor of filmmakers taking an innovative approach to tell a story on film. However, when the result is a messy and uneven film, it makes me a bit cinematically psychotic realizing I will never get back those close to two hours of my life. And that is what exactly happened as I experienced Writer-Director Martin McDonagh's ""Seven Psychopaths"". Here are seven psychotic reactions I endured while watching this atrocious movie. Psychotic Reaction #1- I felt a bit madly unimpressed watching Colin Farrell star as Marty, a struggling screenwriter whose crave for the bottle made him look like the real Colin Farrell himself during his past spirits-fueled party days. Psychotic Reaction #2- Marty's best friend Billy, played modestly by Sam Rockwell, is a vivacious but disturbed dognapper who takes interest in assisting Marty with a screenplay he is writing up ironically called ""Seven Psychopaths"" by putting an ad in the paper to bring in real psychopaths in order to assist Marty with his writer's block. Consequently, this plays out as a tired and lazy concept which shot blanks in its delivery, and caused me to feel a bit quasi-psychotic. Psychotic Reaction #3- Christopher Walken's supporting performance as Billy's dognapper partner Hans was not in ""Walken"" distance compared to Christopher's past classic performances. Hans is portrayed as a mummy- like character who mumbles and spills constant gibberish throughout the movie. I felt a bit psychotic in realizing that the great Walken would hit this low. Psychotic Reaction #4- I am a big Woody Harrelson fan since his days in ""Cheers"", but I think Harrelson has recently had a case of character-stereotype entrapment in his acting by constantly portraying a heartless bastard, as he does here in ""Seven Psychopaths"" with his over-the-top performance as Charlie, the mafioso who is livid when his shih-tzu Bonny is kidnapped by Billy. By the way, this ""Bonny Situation"" does not have enough pulp to give it an enticing revenge storyline, and caused some psychotic reactions in my cinematic nervous system. Psychotic Reaction #5- I am a big fan of McDonagh's film ""In Bruges"", but his screenplay and direction of ""Seven Psychopaths"" tries to do too much and ends up as a unengaging narrative instead of a witty original piece; and yes, you guessed it, that caused a psychotic reaction in me of profound disappointment in McDonagh's work this time around. Psychotic Reaction #6- As I was watching the movie on DVD in my apartment, the lights went out do to a local blackout; this has nothing to do with the movie, but it did cause a psychotic reaction in me, as I could not see worth a.... Psychotic Reaction #7- The ending of this movie is one of the most unauthentic climaxes I have ever seen on film, and it just made me so mad & psychotic that I got up from my chair and yelled ""I am mad as hell and I am not going to take this anymore""; sorry that I got a bit Networkie there. OK, after reading this review, you must think that I am pun-induced psychopathic pseudo film critic. Yes that is true, and what also rings true is that ""Seven Psychopaths"" should be whacked from your ""movies to see"" list, if its in there already. ** Needs Improvement",Seven Psychopaths
52,drqshadow-reviews,"An Ambitious, If Flawed, Gala of Self-Critique",7,13 March 2014,"Gleefully dark comedy with a habitual tendency to go meta. That's actually a central point of the plot, which revolves around Colin Farrell's tail-chasing efforts to compose the film's screenplay whilst in the midst of it. We dance around this issue for a bit in the first hour, but once embraced it leads to a number of sharp, bitterly funny conversations and revelations that really help the film stand out as something different. Its jaded, desensitized approach to gruesome violence can be unsettling, but something tells me that's kind of the point. For that matter, so are the simple, shallow characters that pepper the perimeter and the story's rambling, uncertain climax. Farrell is constantly bookended by his cohorts, Sam Rockwell and Christopher Walken, who portray two glaringly colorful characters but don't really bring a lot of depth or flavor to the mix. They're each painted with a single stroke, which could again be construed as part of the film's message... but at some point it's natural to question how many times it can fall back on that ready-made excuse.

53,estebangonzalez10,A Seven for Seven Psychopaths,7,8 February 2013,"¨I'm sick of all these stereotypical Hollywood murderer scumbag type psychopath movies. I don't want it to be one more film about guys with guns in their hands.¨This is one weird, strange, unique, and messy movie as the title suggests. At times the film seems to be a masterpiece, at other it simply wonders off too much. I was a bit disappointed with how things turned out, but it was still a great ride. Martin McDonagh is perhaps one of the best contemporary playwriters; I had a blast with his film In Bruges and had huge expectations for this one considering the impressive ensemble cast, but I guess my expectations were set too high because this film didn't work as well as I would have liked. McDonagh does succeed in creating original characters as he plays around with movie clichés and has fun breaking the genre down and putting his spin on things. We've seen other movies about movies before, but not like this one; it never gets generic. This is one funny and quirky dark comedy written with very sharp dialogues and unique characters. You can see some influence from Quentin Tarantino and Martin Scorsese in McDonagh's work, but it still remains fresh and breaks with generic clichés in a way that it remains unique. This is the second time Colin Farrell works with director McDonagh after In Bruges, and in my opinion these are his best roles. We can only hope these two continue to work together. McDonagh couldn't have counted on a better ensemble cast than this one; everyone was terrific here.This dark comedy is about a screenwriter named Marty (Colin Farrell) who is trying to write a screenplay titled Seven Psychopaths. The only problem is that he has only come up with one psychopath so far, and can 't get inspired to write the story. His good friend, Billy (Sam Rockwell), a frustrated actor who makes a living by kidnapping dogs and collecting the ransom, tells him about another psychopath and begins throwing ideas for the script. Billy's associate in the dog kidnapping business is Hans (Christopher Walken) who is trying to make some extra money to help out his wife, Myra (Linda Bright Clay), who is in a clinic diagnosed with cancer. Billy and Hans end up kidnapping a shih tzu from a dangerous mob boss, Charlie (Woody Harrelson). They've messed with the wrong guy, because Charlie begins going all psycho on everyone in order to find his dog. Somehow Marty becomes entangled in this Los Angeles criminal underworld and in a way everyone seems to be pitching in ideas for his movie. The story begins taking some weird and unexpected turns everywhere as the action continues and some of Marty's characters begin to come to life as not everyone seems to be who we expect.This dark comedy has some wonderfully written dialogues with some great moments of humor, but at other times I felt the movie was drifting away by trying to break with generic barriers. It is still a fun movie and one I recommend thanks to an excellent and cleverly written script, and a brilliant ensemble cast. Farrell is always great working alongside McDonagh; Sam Rockwell gives another masterful and quirky performance, Woody Harrelson was made for these types of role, and Christopher Walken is just spectacular with his deadpan acting. It is not difficult to give good performances when you have such a great screenwriter creating some memorable and funny dialogues. I had a pleasant time with this film although my expectations were set much higher considering McDonagh's previous film was much better. I was a huge fan of In Bruges, but Seven Psychopaths didn't really surprise me as much. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Seven Psychopaths
54,jimbo-53-186511,"Great Concept, but sub par execution (pun intended)",6,13 July 2013,"I went in with fairly high expectations for Seven Psychopaths. The trailer looked good and I quite liked the original concept behind the film. Unfortunately, it didn't turn out quite as good as I expected.The good news is that it's not all bad and I would like to say that Sam Rockwell (as Billy - Psychopath number 7) was absolutely brilliant. Every time he appeared on screen I found myself laughing and I just felt that not only was his character well written, but also that his acting was excellent. I felt that both him and Colin Farrell had great on screen chemistry. All other performances were good, but I felt that Woody Harrelson was a bit too safe a choice (his performance in this was very similar to his performance as Mickey Knox in Natural Born Killers - again not a bad thing, but as I said just too safe). I also liked the way it poked fun at the gangster genre as a whole. Charlie - played by Woody Harrelson has a gun that only works when it feels like it, but he won't part with it because he likes its handle. Also the whole concept of a mob boss pursuing people for his lost dog was totally absurd, but somehow it was still funny - Charlie crying as well each time his dog was threatened was absolutely priceless. Whilst I don't mind absurdity in films, it does annoy me when absurd things happen that go against logic or that just aren't believable.There is one scene where Charlie walks into a hospital and shoots Hans (Christopher Walken's) wife in a hospital without any consequence - seemingly there is no-one in the vicinity that heard the gunshot and therefore no-one there to raise the alarm. Really? This seemed totally implausible and unrealistic. Secondly, if you are being pursued by a mad man who is intent on finding you, would you really carry his dog everywhere you went - a bit of a giveaway if he doesn't know who he is looking for. I also felt that the sub plot was more interesting than the main plot - why couldn't we see more of Charlie pursuing the guys that took his dog. I personally feel that this would have made for a much better film and would have given a real 'cat and mouse' feel to it and certainly would have made it more exciting. I felt the main plot of Marty (Colin Farrell) a struggling writer finally managing to complete his story through life experiences i.e (the 7 psychopaths) who all contributed either physically or through narrative form whilst moderately interesting just dragged on for too long and became rather boring. The final problem is that it is a billed as a 'Crime' 'Comedy' and 'Thriller' and sadly, for the most part I felt it only achieved 1 of those 3 'Crime'.Perhaps I'm being too harsh on Seven Psychopaths, but it just angers me in a way that a film with so much potential could be so poorly executed. There are a couple of fairly good twists in the film and I must admit I loved the irony of Billy shooting Charlie next to a 'no shooting sign'. It's worth watching if only for Sam Rockwell's performance.",Seven Psychopaths
55,NateWatchesCoolMovies,"A deft, cheeky poke at screen writing, and a blast of pure fun",10,21 November 2015,"How Martin Mcdonough's savagely brilliant script for Seven Psychopaths was overlooked in the awards circle is beyond me, and a testament to what an elitist farce they have become. It's a movie for screenwriters, about screenwriters, and with a few valuable lessons for screenwriters, wrapped up in a hilarious story about a bunch of whackos (I say a bunch instead of Seven because the movie muddled up who is actually the Seven Psychopaths, and doesn't even seem sure itself which is which, adding to the mayhem) all colliding in the Los Angeles area. Marty (Colin Farrell, the most sane, which isn't saying much) plays Marty, a frumpy alcoholic script writer who's struggling with his newest creation, titled, you guessed it, Seven Psychopaths. His pal Billy (Sam Rockwell) is a hyperactive weirdo determined to help him beat the writer's block any way he can. Rockwell never, ever disappoints and this is my favourite work ever from him, nailing every bizarre, darkly comic beat and chomping down on every syllable of McDonough's script that he can lay his hands on, a sarcastic, profane, ultimately lovable nutjob and an absolute delight to be in the presence of. Billy, along with his pal Hans (an introverted Christopher Walken, in one of the strangest characters he's ever played, and not in his usual sense), are dognappers, snatching pooches of the Venice Beach boardwalk and returning them to their owners for the ill gotten reward money. Things go swimmingly until they unknowingly take a little Pomeranian that happens to belong to volatile gangster Costello (a priceless Woody Harrelson, replacing Mickey Rourke). They're forced to go on the run from Costello and his vicious main man (Zelijko Ivanek, even funnier here than he was in Mcdonough's In Bruges), deciding to take a meandering detour to remote Joshua Tree for some... philosophizing, substance abuse and roundtable discussions on Marty's script. It's an interesting deviation for a lively crime comedy to take, one that mirrors Marty's intentions for his script in a way that reflects Mcdonough's viewpoint on where most movies take us, and where they could take us, given a bit of freedom and intuition. There's plenty of graphic violence as well, as people get shot, stabbed, bludgeoned, maimed, slashed to ribbons and all sorts of other vivid bodily harm. It's all lighthearted though, and even being a black comedy, we never get a bitter or mean spirited aftertaste, which is the beauty of McDonough's stories, really. He's so meticulous and determined to get his characters right, that all the other nastiness is balanced nicely by their interaction and we never feel overwhelmed by any of it. There ain't much in the way of female characters (also a sly running joke), but Olga Kurylenko, Gabourey Sidibe and Abbie Cornish do show up briefly, as well as memorable work from Michael Stuhlberg, Michael Pitt, Kevin Corrigan, Harry Dean Stanton and Tom Waits in an unforgettable appearance as a machete wielding maniac who carries around a bunny rabbit. It all feels familiar at first, but Mcdonough turns every convention inside out and yanks the rug right out from under us with his stinging, subtly condemning and altogether enjoyable tale within a tale. Not the masterpiece that In Brues is (I'm working up to reviewing that one), but one of the top three films of 2012, and unforgettable in its challenging and hilarious sense of breaking every storytelling rule in the book, and just being a damned entertaining piece of pulpy fun.",Seven Psychopaths

It combines blood and gore at a near slasher level with the almost bizarre hunt for the kidnapped dog and a hunt for psychopaths. In the middle of it is Marty, trying to write a script for a movie, almost like an independent observer.It is witty and fun, and makes you cringe sometimes. And, as one of the characters says, it got layers with Marty commenting how a movie with psychopaths should evolve and being in one at the same time. It gives the movie an edge with insider jokes. In all this is a movie that pushes at the boundaries, it is definitely not a mainstream movie. But if you want an experience that is, for a lack of a better word, different, this is one you want to try out.As a bonus it got some good casting. Roles like these are a perfect fit for both Harrelson (even if, according to trivia, he wasn't the first choice) and especially Walken. And they perform perfectly. Farell has gone under the radar, at least mine, in recent years but does well too.I can't really decide if I should rate this higher or not. Some moments it feels like a great movie, others are more average. But it will definitely stay with me for a while. And that says something, doesn't it?7/10",Seven Psychopaths
58,Spondonman,I really really wanted it not to die,7,13 January 2013,"One reason the excess violence in In Bruges didn't bother me was that it only happened to people who deserved it, I'm not a fan of shooting up the innocent bystander movies. I think only people who deserved it got it in Seven Psychopaths, but I'd have to watch it again to check and this time round it's delivered with a lot less absurdity, less panache and a lot more self-congratulation.Script writer with mental block William Holden, sorry, alcoholic Colin Farrell is trying to piece together stories containing crackpots into an incoherent whole, while his barmy friend is involved in a dognapping business with a sinister old man in a cravat with a wife dying of cancer in hospital. Shih-tzu is stolen from gangster leading to mayhem either in so-called reality or so-called fiction. It's well made and well presented in every department, except the plot tries to be too different and ends up being familiar and predictable. However it was the ending that was just not good enough, in fact a mega anti-climax which indicated to me how superficial and flimsy the whole story had been. If you're led into looking at things differently for 90 minutes you can't help but want a different kind of punchline. And there's no one you care enough about to worry or be glad about being shot, not even Farrell or the dog. There's amusing witticisms galore, but none to In Bruges standard - and even one excruciating directionless bit when Christopher Walken refuses to obey the gunpoint Hands Up order – didn't Monty Python do that one?It's a clever movie that knows it and I fairly enjoyed it, but whereas I can marvel at In Bruges bloodthirsty artistry again and again I doubt I'll be back for second helpings of this even to double check its probable adherence to a moral code.",Seven Psychopaths
59,dalydj-918-255175,Seven Pyschopaths is a 90's film for modern times,8,7 December 2012,"""The great crime films of the 90's have always included a lot of comedy and Pschopaths maybe a return to the format in a best way"" When Goodfellas was released right at the beginning of the 90's showing how crime films can mix in comedy. All throughout that decade some directors tried their own versions of the genre including the best example being Quentin Tarantino doing Pulp Fiction which this film seems to take it's influence from. Starting with an unconnected opening scene moving onto a drunken screenwriter Marty Faranan (Colin Farrel). We are then introduced to the people in his life including his crazy dog kidnapper friend Billy Bickle (Sam Rockwell) and his partner in crime Hans Kieslowski (Christopher Walken). The group of three get involved with crime boss Charlie Costello (Woody Harrelson) when they steal his dog leading to a journey of writing a movie and trying to stay alive when a psychopathic gangster leader is after you.Martin McDonagh has an Oscar under his belt and he last film was very well received. However I believe that out of his films this is his best one to date because it mixes in humour of scriptwriting and how these writers come up with their crazy ideas for these scripts. The film is very well influenced by the previous films of it's genre from it's opening scene which really has nothing to do with the rest of the film but just puts you into the atmosphere of conversation and violence on the screen. The characters are very out there and they sometimes do not see how their actions come off to the people around them. The film also makes fun at one stage that the female characters are wasted and with only two really main there did not appear in it for much but still they were not well written as they could be and did not need to be in the film.Colin Farrel plays the lead of Marty and he is just OK but I believe that he is the least interesting character because unlike the other characters he is given not much to do except being drunk which has almost been done to death. Sam Rockwell is very underrated I believe as an actor and in this film he gets to completely blow everyone away with his mix of comedy and thunderers craziness. He starts of as a man we think as strange and off beat then taking a surprising turn where he becomes the true crazy one who never really knew how he came off especially when he came to his final conclusion where he knew he had lost. Christopher Walken does his best impression of his normal persona playing the cool and calm Hans who does start off strong but once he goes through a tragedy he seems to start to lose it leading to his departure.The film overall is very funny especially when able to make fun off the struggle to write a film. Some of the quick appearances especially from Tom Waits who is not on screen for long but his story was a great addition to the film but it did not really need to be there as much. The ensemble had great cast and McDonagh shows that he is building a strong resume also getting the most decent performances out of Colin Farrel.MOVIE GRADE: B+ (MVP: Sam Rockwell)",Seven Psychopaths
60,robertemerald,Interesting Hollywood...,8,4 February 2019,"I wondered what to compare this movie to, and I came up with Twin Peaks without the parallel universe (the latest series). It's very Hollywood, with big stars given a script to which they can perform. There is much more talk than action, the plot being a tale about a man writing a tale which in turn is about tales. Essentially it's a buddy movie, which is where it leaves its message, which rests on various levels of morality. There is some random killing, but not as much as the title might suggest. For me, only a few scenes generated atmosphere out of menace, and I think comparisons to Tarantino are false because of this. I also thought it lacked punch, and held back from shocking the audience with more graphic violence. Serious characters often don't come across as serious. It's whacky, almost a comedy. But it's fun, rolling along with good surprises here and there, a rich literary landscape, great views of California, and well worth a look.",Seven Psychopaths
61,jadepietro,Stir Crazy,7,18 October 2012,"This film is mildly recommended.Just how crazy is crazy? This film-within-a-film tries to answer that issue as it presents seven ( or more ) genuine nut cases who somehow cross each other's path in the independent film, Seven Psychopaths. This dark comedy follows an alcoholic screenwriter named Marty ( Colin Farrell ) who is suffering from an extreme case of writer's block while trying to write a script coincidently called Seven Psychopaths too. His eccentric and loyal friend Billy (Sam Rockwell ) decides to intervene and takes Marty on a strange journey of self-enlightenment with his dognapping business partner, Hans ( a typecast Christopher Walken ) in tow. ( Yes, I grant you it doesn't make much sense, but the frantic plot does thicken and sicken as the film's violence escalates amid the laughs. )Unfortunately, this time Billy has stolen a gangster's pet Shih Tzu. This leads to an unhinged Charlie ( Woody Harrelson ), the owner of the aforementioned stolen property. Along the way, the movie-going audience also meets other lunatics like Zachariah ( Tom Waits ), a serial killer who kills serial killers, a vengeful Vietnamese priest ( Long Nguyen ), and Harry Dean Stanton as the mysterious Man in the Hat. All crazies, please step to the right and pick a number!But the head cases don't stop there. Everyone in this film, down to the smallest of roles, is slightly off center including two hit men named Tommy (Michael Stuhlbarg ) and Larry ( Michael Pitt ) and yet another gangster, Paulo ( Zeljko Ivanek ), Charlie's right-hand man. Also on hand are Kaya ( Abbie Cornish ), Angela ( Olga Kurylenko ), and Myra ( Linda Bright Clay ), companions of Marty, Billy, and Hans, whose peripheral inclusion in the plot is a misuse of gender, beauty, and talent.Seven Psychopaths is a wry farce, a send-up of the genre that celebrates the bizarre with a definite Pulp Fiction attitude. It doesn't always succeed in its outlandish ways, but the film does toy with its audience and their own liberal notions of crime and punishment.Written and directed by Martin McDonagh, the talented Irish author whose plays ( The Beauty Queen of Leenane, The Lieutenant of Inishmore, The Pillowman ) and his last film, In Bruges, have continually tackled grim subjects with a sardonic and quirky edge. Seven Psychopaths is more of the same. The film shares an abundance of clever lines throughout, but the plot is ho-hum and becomes repetitive, with some scenes borderline nasty. Dysfunction may be thine middle name, Mr. McDonagh, but this film wallows in it. There's an underlying unpleasantness to the antics seen on the screen and the film never quite recovers from the gratuitous violence and a script that rarely stays focused.The cast sets the right tone and take on their comic roles seriously, which needs to be the case with this type of bloody farce. McDonagh directs his actors well, although he allows Walken to overplay his standard sicko shtick without much distinction from his previous roles. However, the director does get particularly strong performances from Farrell, Harrelson, Waits, and an especially delightful turn by Rockwell as the wayward buddy, who not only steals canines, but also this movie. As for the actresses, Clay shows a believable vulnerability and dignity in her small part, probably the only redeeming character in the entire film, but both Cornish and Kurylenko are wasted in their showy but underwritten roles.Seven Psychopaths is mostly at odds with itself and its audience. As the film progresses to its violent conclusion, the story unravels more and more as do its the wound-up characters, leading to more absurdist situations and a higher than average body count to satisfy the gore ratio. It's the type of film that will be thoroughly enjoyed by the Tarantino crowd and probably nobody else. But like it or not, this derisive film stays true to its own demons and rarely takes an easy way out of its deepening troubles. Overall, I did like and admire Seven Psychopaths, but I don't think most average moviegoers will. That may sound crazy, but not as crazed and deranged as this film experience would want you to believe. GRADE: B-NOTE: The artistically ""damaged"" lime-green movie poster is a wonderful example of graphic art, but it is totally misleading. It sets the right tone of the film, but unfortunately mislabels the actual seven psychopaths.

And unlike Tarantino's works, this movie doesn't really have those uber long scenes. The acting is just nice. I like to see so many stars in it, just like a typical Tarantino movie. Colin Farrell did okay in portraying the friend caught in the middle of real life psychos. CHristopher Walken acted out the crazy dog kidnapper nicely. Sam Rockwell acted out the crazy careless part nicely here.

63,p-stepien,Step aside for the new Peckinpah,9,21 January 2013,"A subversively brilliant meta-film with some intellectual panache seeping through the bloody exterior. When Hollywood scriptwriter Marty (Colin Farrell) finds himself struggling to write his new screenplay, for now only figuring as a plot less title ""Seven Psychopaths"", his best mate Billy (Sam Rockwell), whose day job is stealing rich people's dogs together with his partner Hans (Christopher Walken) and then returning them to their owners to collect a finder's fee, decides to aide him in his efforts. Apart from throwing in an occasional story about multi-layered psychotic individuals, he also runs an ad for psychos to call in and tell their life stories, collects articles about a serial killer whacking off mobsters as well as brings Marty into close contact with a maniacal crime-lord Charlie (Woody Harrelson), who is obsessively devoted to his shih-tzu. When Billy steals the minuscule dog he initiates a bloody spiral cat-and-dog chase, which culminates into an unexpected fashion. In the meantime Marty is delivered first hand access to a plethora of psychopaths with both Hans and Billy chipping in to the creative process with their ideas...After the breakthrough ""In Bruges"", Martin McDonagh proved himself to have a wickedly vast grasp of filmmaking, subtly able to convert the cliché in a genre into a interloping commentary on both society and violence. ""Seven Psychopaths"" has him steadfastly venture straight into Hollywood and ingeniously structuring a meta-film about filmmaking, scriptwriting woven in a web worthy of the Coen Brothers, albeit with his own distinct touch. McDonagh treads down the path many early fans expected Quentin Tarantino and Guy Ritchie to venture, before the first sidelined himself as the film world 'class clown', while the second apparently spent his entire creative force on the first few pictures.Surprisingly ""Seven Psychopaths"" has received nowhere near the interest and focus as ""Pulp Fiction"", not to mention that of the intellectually inferior ""Django Unchained"", whereas one could expect a similar level of praise and furore given just how consequential and delightfully satisfying a picture this is. And Tarantino is probably the best person to compare McDonagh too. Both are incessantly drawn to violence in cinema, but whereas the American film aficionado uses it to create full length feature movie jokes, homaging various genres to the glee of likewise minded freaks, McDonagh manages to use the inherent flaws, expectations within a given type of movie to pose questions and draw attention to various issues. Whereas dialogue overflows in the work of both men, McDonagh's actually has a point of reference, an underlying goal, not just talk for talk's purpose. For example, an essential discussion occurs when Marty, Billy and Hans are driving to escape the wrath of Billy. Here Marty confides about the real movie he would like to make, where the initial violence introduced to the movie in the guise of psychopaths would peter out having the later half of the story focus on the protagonists idly sitting, waiting and holding philosophical disputes in the middle of the desert. And this is exactly what transpires for most of the remainder of the movie (enhanced by calm, brightly saturated lensing), albeit Billy is intent on a more explosive ending with an epic stand off as the denouement, thus doing his best to guarantee that the plot isn't mired down into a bunch of guys sitting around a fire and talking.Billy is the audience, the target group, whose expectations inadvertently influence the writer's decisions, thus mindlessly choosing to sabotage any chance for a contemplative ending. Hans brings a certain balance (the thoughtful viewer?) suggesting content with meaning, where his concept of a psychopath has ulterior motives and goals, making his actions almost sacrificial in nature, accepting that necessity requires blood, but it need not be senseless violence, such as that proposed by the more Tarantinesque belligerent Billy, whose focus is primarily on the bloody shoot out and its effectiveness, not at the reasons or consequences.Built around a story with surprising coherency and not overly diverting away to meta-analysis, McDonagh manages to fuse together the more contemplative side with some stark entertainment and wry dark humour. Fronted by a phenomenally well-rounded cast, who manage to keep within their character boundaries, despite the self-referential filmmaking contextualisation (especially in regards to Christopher Walken who treads a fine line between auto-parody and delivering the most substantial impact on the story).",Seven Psychopaths

65,brando647,An Absolute Blast with Hilarious Dark Humor,9,3 April 2013,"Martin McDonagh's SEVEN PSYCHOPATHS is one of the better movies I've seen this year. I've heard a lot of good things about his previous movie, IN BRUGES (also starring Colin Farrell), but I haven't had a chance to see it. All of the positive buzz around IN BRUGES would have been enough to get me interested in SEVEN PSYCHOPATHS, but it was the hilarious trailer that won me over. Dark comedies are the best comedies, and this movie has some pretty bleak humor. Not to mention, the cast can't be beat. The movie didn't seem to get much of a national release, and most people I ask don't seem to know much (if anything) about it. It's sort of frustrating, knowing that this movie is receiving limited attention while movies like BATTLESHIP are getting massive ad campaigns and a major release. All I can do is spread the word and help my friends discover this little gem. SEVEN PSYCHOPATHS is about a screenwriter in Los Angeles, Marty (Farrell), struggling to write his new screenplay of the same name. His friend Billy (Sam Rockwell) is a strange dude, spending his days kidnapping dogs with his partner Hans (Christopher Walken) and returning them to their owners for a reward. One of their exploits finds them kidnapping the Shih Tzu of psychotic local crime boss Charlie, putting them on the run. Marty's search for inspiration is about to hit him with more than he bargained when his life is suddenly overrun by lunatics.Let me start with this: Sam Rockwell, as he so often manages to do, totally steals the show. In a movie that advertises seven psychopaths, Rockwell is the king of the mountain. Billy is a total trip and more than he appears. Rockwell can do crazy better than most, and the best part is that the movie leaves you doubting that he's as insane as he puts on. Billy is determined to help Marty write his script and, as off-the-wall as his ideas might be, he really turns into the guiding force of this movie. As Rockwell's partner in crime, Hans is Walken's best role in a good while. Hans is much more subtle psychopath; one might not even except him to fit the bill. Hans is a soft-spoken, God-fearing man who uses the money he raises from the dog-napping scheme to pay for his wife's cancer treatments. Just as with Billy, Hans has some pretty dark secrets of his own. Walken is a great fit for this movie and it's cool seeing him in something of quality again. Farrell is great as the alcoholic screenwriter caught in the middle of the whole ordeal, acting as the straight-man to all of the insanity going on around him. I don't see much of Farrell anymore and his teaming with director McDonagh here has got me even more curious to watch IN BRUGES. I understand it has the same dark humor as SEVEN PSYCHOPATHS, so it's got to be as fun as this.The supporting cast is worth mentioning, as it's pretty heavily advertised in the trailers. Olga Kurylenko and Abbie Cornish are really nothing more than bit parts as love interests for Charlie and Marty. Tom Waits has a fun little part as a psychopath responding to an ad in the newspaper seeking real-life psychos for inspiration in Marty's script. He's hasn't got more than two scenes in the movie but they're memorable. And then there's Woody Harrelson as crime boss Charlie Costello. Anyone who's seen Harrelson's other movies knows the man can do crazy (e.g. NATURAL BORN KILLERS) and it's fun to see him go from cold-blooded murderer to sobbing over Bonnie, his lost Shih Tzu. The whole movie is saturated in that sort of humor, finding the funny in the dark nature of these characters. There's some pretty gnarly violence in the movie, so people who are sensitive to bloody gun violence should be warned. But it's more than bloody murders and bizarre humor; SEVEN PSYCHOPATHS has more layers than that. In the movie, Marty wants his script to be focused on these seven psychopaths but ultimately about love. This theme sort of plays out in the movie itself: every bit of violence in the movie is done (in one way or another) in the name of love. Charlie desperately wants to save his beloved dog, Hans (anti-violence himself, though directly involved in the chaos) is helping his wife, Tom Waits' serial-killer killer Zachariah is searching for his lost love, and Billy's actions are all driven by a desire to help his friend succeed. So, in a way, Marty found his SEVEN PSYCHOPATHS. This movie is a total blast and I highly recommend giving it a shot.",Seven Psychopaths

It starts out a poor man's Tarantino but ends up unique, funny and sad.The big flaw is that Farrell is not a convincing actor. But he's surrounded by American genius - the performances by Walken, Harrelson and Rockwell are wonderful.The story tends toward writer's navel-gazing and drags for about an hour, but the last half hour is truly funny - although impossible to explain: uuuh, kinda like a meta-Spaghetti Western.I guess a lot of the material could have been cut from a rambling introduction, but the story really comes together as the characters turn into the storytellers. In the end your sympathy is with three philosophical murderers. The best bit is Walken's monologue into the dictaphone.Good sound and music.I may be too generous, but it really got me in the end.

Marty (Colin Farrell) - Billy's friend - is writing a novel called Seven Psychopaths and is an innocent bystander in the dog-napping venture. Here's the thing. There are many big stars in here who try too hard to be funny and fail at every turn. You will see numerous indiscriminate shootings/killings that produce a lot of bloody gore; you will hear the N-Word, the C-Word and there will be some nudity in the beginning. There are no good one-liners. The acting is okay for what the script gives them, but the script needed a lot of work. It was released too soon. I take back the okay acting comment: Sam Rockwell's Billy is annoying most of the time. Later in the desert he becomes way too animated/crazy and you will want to shut this down and you will wonder why you watched it this far. Billy tries to get Marty to stop drinking and concentrate on his novel as he wants a hand in writing the screenplay for the movie. To be fair, the only actors who are watchable - but not funny - with this very weak script are Colin Farrell, Christopher Walken, and Woody Harrelson.

Where In Bruges was intelligent, quietly paced and relatively realistic. Seven Psychopaths is on-the-nose, messy and beyond belief. It's also ridiculously entertaining. It's like if Kaufman's Adaptation had a Guy Ritchie kick but with extra unpredictable twists and turns and star cameos. It's a real wild ride, and works best if you turn your brain off as the satire of these types of movies tries to come off as clever but they're obvious observations. Although in the first act, character interactions come off as awkward, which is especially surprising given that was one of In Bruges' strengths, it's full of unbridled energy for stories and story convention. It's clear that this is just Martin McDonagh venting about his Hollywood experience post-Bruges, with the main character called Martin and him being a screenwriter, it feels as though to break free from those expectations, he created this bombastic film with everything he could think of in it. Although the one thing I expected to love, Sam Rockwell, was actually pretty irritating, the other side characters were more than enough to redeem. It's a really funny film that's difficult to absorb but it's all purely fun.7/10",Seven Psychopaths
69,tomsview,A star per psychopath,7,1 May 2014,"Amazingly, this crazy movie actually works.The film is set in Los Angeles, and has a great cast. Will Farrell is his personable self as Marty Faranan, a screenwriter who is working on a script about psychopaths – seven in total. Marty is also about the most normal person in the story. He is helped, or over-helped, by his friend, Billy Bickle (Sam Rockwell). As they explore scenarios, the stories they imagine play out on the screen, and their research also uncovers some real psychopaths – occasionally it's hard to tell which is which.Along the way, they become involved with Hans Kieslowski (Christopher Walken) who steals dogs and then collects the reward for finding them. As well as dogs, Christopher Walken steals the movie; his offbeat screen persona is perfect for this film.The movie goes into hyper-drive when Billy Bickle kidnaps the pet Shih Tzu belonging to gangster, Charlie Costello, played by Woody Harrelson – also terrific as the stressed out gangster. In the end, the search for the dog becomes entangled with the real and the imagined psychopaths. The film also has a clever sequence after the end credits.Sound a little bewildering? It is; the film even works in a sub plot about the My Lai massacre. The best thing to do with ""Seven Psychopaths"" is just sit back and enjoy the ride.I have little criticism of the film; it is what it is. However, I was surprised that Abbie Cornish and Olga Kurylenko had such small roles – both are easy to watch – it's a pity they didn't hang around longer.Over the years, movies and television have trained audiences to accept movies that break away from a linear approach to storytelling, and we see plenty of movies these days that do that – David Lynch's films for starters. Just think how an audience in 1956 would have reacted to ""Seven Psychopaths""? They probably would have thrown things at the screen thinking that the projectionist had mixed up the reels.Instead of just a compilation soundtrack of existing music, British writer/director Martin McDonagh went for an original score by Carter Burwell – for the most part anyway. Burwell's score works well with this movie, and he has such a distinctive sound that once you know his work you can always pick it out.I certainly wouldn't want all my films to be like this, but every now and then it's good that a movie really stretches the boundaries without becoming totally unwatchable.",Seven Psychopaths

As a result, a reflexive, self-aware tone pervades the movie.The cast of assorted psychopaths and other odd personages is well stocked with acting talent. In this ensemble piece, the interestingly varied trio of Colin Farrell, Sam Rockwell & Christopher Walken feature most prominently. In support, Woody Harrelson contributes a memorable performance and so does Tom Waits. Other recognizable actors manage to make a mark in smaller roles, including Harry Dean Stanton, Michael Pitt, Michael Stuhlbarg & Gabourey Sidibe.Martin McDonagh's direction is well handled throughout the picture. The visuals are attractive and stylish without crossing the line into overindulgence. Interesting use is made of music as well. The soundtrack choices, which are mostly unfamiliar and often atypical of this type of film, include apt uses of P.P. Arnold's rendition of ""The First Cut is the Deepest"" and the Stone Poneys' ""Different Drum"".However, what separates ""Seven Psychopaths"" from most films of its ilk is its surprising depth. Despite approaching the criminal activities from a blackly humorous angle, McDonagh still managed to instill his screenplay with an overarching theme of love. I'm not sure that his execution was an unqualified success but he deserves credit for breaking the mold. Even the Tarantino-esque opening scene shows a flair that goes beyond mere imitation.Ultimately, ""Seven Psychopaths"" is a difficult movie to categorize. As a comedic crime movie it satisfies in terms of undemanding entertainment but the dramatic elements serve to elevate it to another level. With this mix, some may find the movie too serious while others may find it too flippant. All I can say is that I found it to be a rewarding watch and an improvement upon the promise shown by McDonagh's debut, ""In Bruges"".",Seven Psychopaths

72,napierslogs,"Finding the middle ground between comedy, violence and psychopaths",8,28 January 2013,"Depending on how you count, there really are seven psychopaths. Also depending on how you count, there could be more, which is a good thing because Marty – the lead character played by Colin Farrell not the screenwriter Martin McDonagh – can use as many as he can find. Marty (Colin Farrell) is an alcoholic Irish screenwriter suffering from writer's block since Hollywood's needs and his ideals do not match up at all.""Seven Pyschopaths"" the rather ingenious, well-written, violent, hilarious, crime drama comedy does manage to find a happy medium between what Hollywood wants and what romantic idealist Marty wants. If you can imagine how hard it would be to find that happy medium, then you can probably imagine how easy it would be to find detractors for this film. They complain about the senseless violence, the meandering story lines and the shifts in tone. But the brilliance in the screenplay and the ensemble cast can allow many to ignore all that.Marty wants to write a character study, a meaningful one where he finds significant life events to reflect upon to find love and happiness. Hollywood wants an action film. One with shoot-outs with as many characters and as many violent deaths as could possibly be included. Marty is a gentle spirit even if he is neurotic, has a bad taste in friends and indulges in unhealthy habits, he does want to find that happy place in life. He relies on the chaotic, crazy and cruel world around him, and also his chaotic, crazy and cruel friends, to provide inspiration for his screenplay.Independent Spirit Award nominee Sam Rockwell plays Billy a manic, ne'er-do-well who kidnaps dogs and then returns them for the reward. His compatriot, Hans (Christopher Walken), is a philosophical old soul who takes all the violence and craziness in stride. Their criminal actions could catch up to them sooner rather than later when psychopath Charlie (Woody Harrelson) has his dog stolen and he has no problem killing everybody in his path to retrieve his precious Shih Tzu.As these great actors and psychopathic characters all come together they provide ""Seven Psychopaths"" with exactly what was needed: unrestrained shoot-outs and philosophical musings on life, love and death. I would prefer just comedy but the script, the great actors and the psychopathic characters provided that as well.",Seven Psychopaths

74,sharky_55,Worst final shootout ever,5,23 May 2016,"The opening scene of Seven Psychopaths sees two mob killers engaged in an irrelevant conversation whilst waiting for their target to show up. Inexplicably, these empty words hold our attention enough to render the presence of another killer striding right up to and shooting both in the head invisible enough until it has already happened. It is meaningless and shocking, but what are we to make of this? It is barely connected to the main plot. The violence is senseless and matter-of-fact; we are given little time to even orientate ourselves before McDonagh starts off with a literal and figurative bang. Is this a homage to Tarantino, or sly mockery? This is the problem with McDonagh's second feature after the brilliant In Bruges; we can place the intention to subvert quite easily when it cuts to a new scene. But to what extent is subversion for its own sake just empty sentiment? Viewers who have experienced a nice thick dosage of pop culture, especially in film, will nod in agreement to many of Seven Psychopaths' twists and turns. But is there anything underneath?Crime films have led us to believe that the prototype villain is ruthless and cold. They talk in bullets and explosions, and grunts when they need to. They certainly don't have a strong fixation for adorable little Shih Tzus. So McDonagh is twisting our expectations, to a degree. The flaw in this type of thinking is needing to overturn cliché so deliberately that you inevitably start to become self-indulgent in your own characterisations. The criminals in Seven Psychopaths are not just removed from your average, stock-standard baddie. They have to have tons and tons of attitude and personality. They have to be the direct opposite of the hyper-masculine, insensitive and cold-blooded killers that we are so used to. The profanity stays of course. This is empty personality, but it does keep McDonagh from straying too far. And so does the graphic violence. The great irony in these conventional criminals is that they are cruel and ruthless, but also need to appeal to a younger crowd, so the violence is only hinted at. McDonagh, without this restriction, has gone a tad overboard, splattering walls with exaggerated streaks of blood in a way that is more indulgent than Tarantino could ever do so (a sentence I thought I would never write). What this equates to is that the violence is never truly subversive, but rather submits to its own mockery. In one fantasy scene Rockwell narrates his ideal final shootout that has everything single element and cliché and blood-spray crammed into it. What McDonagh is blind to is that the rest of the movie is exactly the same thing, only without the crude, faux-humorous meta commentary. Barf. And for what cause? The film's plot is wrapped up within a story in a story structure, preying on the writer's block of Marty as a treasure trove for the most ludicrous and zany sequences that are bound by no conventional rules. It seems that these are less well-integrated ideas into the narrative and more cool stories that McDonagh just wanted to chuck in there for the hell of it. The film tries to tread the fine line between parody and self-parody; thank goodness that these chapters of Marty's book are not taken completely seriously, else the story turn into a complete farce. And still the characters can't help but wink heavily at the camera as they flip the tropes on their heads, as they remark on the absurdity of such a lame final shootout, as they break the established conduct under gunpoint, as they utter lines such as: ""I know you think dream sequences are for fags but I think it can work."" These lines have no other function other than to be a self- congratulatory wink, and reek of indulgence, yet they turn up again and again. Instead of giving us a delicate or even engaging narrative, McDonagh has taken the opportunity to blast into our faces how awesome and spontaneous there pop bubble-gum criminals are. It subverts, pats itself on the back for being so clever and insightful, and then ignores its own rules anyhow. See how the film treats its women; as nothing but empty vessels to be exploited and beaten down. McDonagh then acknowledges this concern by turning a dumb blonde prostitute into a sophisticated worldly peer, but he hasn't actually done anything but add to the problem (and highlight and underline it several times).",Seven Psychopaths
75,aciessi,8 for Seven,8,17 September 2020,"Compared to In Bruges and Three Billboards, Seven Psychopaths comes up short. Which says a lot, because Seven Psychopaths is a pretty good movie. As a crime thriller and a dark comedy, it's snappy and properly twisted. It pushes all the right buttons. The gallows humor here is funny and I laughed. That's pretty important with a film like this. I thought that the recurring theme of the screenplay didn't mesh as well with the main conflict of the story as well as I think the film thought it did. It feels choppy and unfocused. But it almost doesn't matter. You just go with the flow. McDonagh is a master at directing actors and here, the performances are fire. Sam Rockwell is the standout as the top psychopath. That's without mentioning and excellent performance by Colin Farrell and the ever amazing and unpredictable Christopher Walken. It all works.",Seven Psychopaths

Maybe it's constructed too artfully for my liking, or perhaps it tries SO HARD to be off the wall it seems a little desperate. Whatever... I enjoyed it while it was on... but I can't see myself viewing it again unless my entire collection of DVDs got destroyed in a fire, minus this one. Stranger things have happened...Racking my brains, I can remember a laid-back Christopher Walken giving a touching performance... he was my favourite. And Woody Harrelson also scored as a mob boss with an unhealthy infatuation around his dog ( VERY unhealthy for the ones who try to kidnap it).

Sadly, the work gets sorta lost at about the half-way mark. There's a wholesale tone shift. The first half is a scintillating succession of tour-de-force redemptive spins to stories of psychopaths. Then the writer warns of the impending tone shift, as though that's all it'll take for the writer to redeem that aesthetic decision. And the last half would, if it could, live up to the first; but I'm sorry to say it didn't work for me.Now, the good stuff: Great writing, directing, acting, cinematography, editing, much great story management with artful flashbacks. Real edge-of-the-seat type stuff!In the end, and in spite of the stated remonstrances, I have to say it was very, very well worth watching, if only for the first half, and with a proviso that the second half does arguably have its subdued place.You'll find lovely layering in the flick; meta-statements abound, generally pointing toward the role of the unhinged/unfeeling/amoral in the working out of destiny.",Seven Psychopaths

80,griffolyon12,Nonsensical and Psychotic,5,4 December 2012,"Seven Psychopaths is a film that requires an acquired taste. If you like films in the vein of Quentin Tarrantino, or loved Psychopaths' director, Martin McDonagh's previous film, In Bruges, then you'll love this film, and if you don't, you're left scratching your head for the entirety of this film at all of the senseless violence and pointless obscenities.In the film, Sam Rockwell, Colin Farrell, and Christopher Walken, kidnap a gangster's Shih Tzu, and this leads to all of the crazy, bizarre antics of the entire film. That's all you need to know about Seven Psychopaths. It's psychotic and the character's psychosis make very little sense in a realistic fashion. It's over-the-top, and glorifies itself for being as such. However, whenever you have the likes of Rockwell, Walken, and Woody Harrelson, sharing the screen together, there will be laughs, even if they're laughs entirely in darkly comedic circumstances. Seven Psychopaths is just for a small niche audience, and I've just accepted that I am not one of that audience. I can see how someone would love this nonsensical film, I'm just not a fan.I give Seven Psychopaths a 5 out of 10!",Seven Psychopaths

82,SquigglyCrunch,A Fun Dark Comedy with Character,7,30 May 2016,"Seven Psychopaths follows a writer as he attempts to write a script for a movie titled 'Seven Psychopaths' (thus the title) and ultimately gets himself involved with a bunch of other psychopaths, one of which wants his stolen dog returned, and will stop at nothing to get it back. The plot of this movie is a joke in itself. It's pretty over-the-top and goofy, but I never laughed about this at any point considering how serious it did often take itself. There were a handful of scenes throughout the movie that were genuinely hilarious, though. The characters were pretty good. The movie tried to make the audience care about them while making you laugh at them, and it managed to do that for the most part. While there were a handful of very funny moments, most of it wasn't really. It treated itself pretty seriously most of the time, and it tried too hard to make the characters good instead of the humor good. The characters were lacking a little too, so it's sacrifice of comedy really wasn't for a great cause. The last act of this movie ended up being a little predictable. The main character mentioned his plan for his script, including the ending, and I immediately realized that the movie was going to end like that. While this isn't necessarily a bad thing, it just could have been better executed in my opinion. One other smaller thing that bothered me were the psychopaths themselves. Most of them weren't very important. One of them didn't actually exist in the movie's reality at all, and I wasn't really sure why he was in it in the first place. It was like some of the psychopaths existed simply so that the title of the movie could be alliteration.When I finished the movie I immediately thought of 'In Bruges', Martin McDonagh's other dark comedy, which came out a few years before this one. In Bruges, to me, was just a better version of this movie. It was like McDonagh tried to make it again, but couldn't quite get it. He couldn't balance humor and characters as well as he did in his previous movie. Overall Seven Psychopaths is still good. There are a handful of genuine laughs scattered throughout as well as some good characters, but it just couldn't balance itself between humor and character as well as it could have. In the end, I'd still recommend this movie. If you like dark humor, it'll be a fun time.",Seven Psychopaths
83,ronakkotian,Fun to watch but didn't stick with me,7,9 February 2021,"I really love Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri and so I was excited to see another Martin McDonagh film. Whilst I did enjoy it, I wasn't amazed by it.Seven Psychopaths follows Marty, a struggling screenwriter who unintentionally gets involved in the underworld after his friend kidnaps a gangster's beloved dog.The story is very odd and so is the film. It reminded me of Burn After Reading with its quirkiness and dark humour. The film puts these characters in unusual situations and acts as a parody in some way. The script is strong as it has some quippy dialogues which were genuinely funny and I loved the unpredictable aspect of the film. The film went directions I didn't expect which kept me guessing how it was going to end. The meta aspect of the film was fun and seeing how it blurred the line between the real world and the fictional world was interesting.The performances by this ensemble cast were terrific. Colin Farrell does a very good job as usual. Sam Rockwell was easily one of the highlights of the film. His way of delivering jokes and expressions made for some hilarious moments. I was very surprised by how good Christopher Walken was in this film. He was very offbeat but I loved every second of it and that's why I think it's the best performance he's given in years. Woody Harrelson was also good and the rest of the cast did act well.Despite all this, I wasn't particularly amazed by Seven Psychopaths.

The dialogues sound hollow and rough for the most part.Finally, the cast, that seemed pretty good on paper, delivers a performance in relation to their mediocre characters.Wanting to be too original and quirky, you forget the fundamentals.",Seven Psychopaths
85,TheSquiss,Both funny and clever but not as funny or clever as it thinks it is.,6,31 December 2012,"Seven Psychopaths is a movie that needs to be seen at least twice. Thus far, I've managed only the once but I strongly suspect it'll be even better second time around. The trailers are an absolute delight and prompted in me the immediate reaction 'I must see it!', not least of all because writer/director Martin McDonagh penned and bellowed on the superb In Bruges and exec produced the superior, in my humble opinion, The Guard.Regrettably, Seven Psychopaths has neither the charm nor the laugh-out-loud humour of either, perhaps in part due to the very obviously missing ingredient, Brendan Gleeson.Struggling screenwriter, Marty (Colin Farrell), is battling with the task of turning his great idea into a workable script entitled Seven Psychopaths. The title works, now all he needs to do is work out how it flows and who those seven might be. Meanwhile he becomes sucked into the LA criminal underworld by his oddball friends, Hans (Christopher Walken) and Billy (Sam Rockwell) who discover that kidnapping Beverly Hills' dogs and returning them to their owners delivers easy rewards. Then they kidnap the worst possible dog: the beloved shih tzu of big, bad, angry gangster, Charlie (Woody Harrelson).This has one of the finest indie ensemble casts this year when you add Gabourey Sidibe (Oscar nominated star of Precious) as the shih tzu's doomed dog-sitter, Michael Pitt (Boardwalk Empire), Abbie Cornish and Tom Waits in a scene-stealing deadpan performance as Zachariah, a nutjob quietly on the edge of all-out murderous insanity. It should work as a film, and it does, but more than that, with such talent on either side of the camera it should absolutely blow us out of the water. It doesn't.The principal issue is that it thinks it's cleverer than it is. Both In Bruges and The Guard just quietly got on with being brilliant, whereas Seven Psychopaths goes to great lengths to show us quite how inventive, quirky and marvelous it is, but forgets to actually be inventive, quirky and marvelous. Throughout the film 'clever' remarks are made about the screenplay within the screenplay (to wit: ""Women don't come off well in your screenplay"") or provide clues for what may come (""That's a good place for a final showdown""), though there is no great mystery for us to solve and I've not spoiled the plot because it's far, far too obvious. It references itself too frequently and to noticeably to work every time.The performances are fine. There's nothing surprising on display but that doesn't matter providing the actors service the film and deliver the characters to make our two-hour investment worthwhile. They do and, largely, it is.And actually, much of the script is clever and funny; just not enough. The funniest moments are, as is all too common, in the trailer (the 'put your hands up' sequence and the 'an eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind' conversation) and though the cinema rattled with light chuckles, I expected it to rock with thunderous belly laughs as with The Guard.There is great pleasure to be taken from the steady body count, not just in the quantity but in the manner in which some expire, and one is never quite sure who will be permitted to live. That alone is refreshing.Oh, if I ever meet McDonagh, he's in serious trouble. Though entertaining, the dialogue of the opening scene is particularly painful for a reviewer with ommetaphobia.Come January I'll procure the DVD and give it another viewing and maybe I'll consider upgrading Seven Psychopaths to eight stars, but for now it rattles around with the many other slightly above average films of 2012. It's a comedy for those who like to think about their humour and resent being spoon fed or told when to laugh but it falls a long way short of this year's blackest comedy, Sightseers.For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.ukLike the Facebook page: http://on.fb.me/RpitOG",Seven Psychopaths
86,andrewroy-04316,Seven Psychopaths is an incoherent series of darkly comedic action satire scenes,4,11 August 2020,"Seven Psychopaths does feel similar to In Bruges, though it is a bit less comedic and less sensible. McDonagh definitely enjoys dark comedy and satire of traditional movie tropes, and he dials that up to an 11 here, with many scenes explicitly discussing the dramatic movie story being told in the plot. There are definitely some funny moments, and overall the comedic elements are one of the stronger parts of the film. The big saving grace of the film was Sam Rockwell, as he is just fantastic in a role that if it had been a mediocre performance, I would've hated this movie. He sells the twist of the movie effectively and balances the aggressive and loyal sides of his character brilliantly, and provides the best humor in the movie. Outside of Rockwell, this was a big disappointment for me. The plot is not interesting and doesn't even make much sense, and the satire just doesn't do anything for me. The script has good one liners and moments, but none of the scenes cohere to form anything interesting or even sensible. I was also really disappointed by Harrelson's performance, as I didn't buy him for a second as a tough guy or in his emotional scenes. The writing doesn't do him any favors, but from the start his intimidating presence is important and his poor performance held back the movie. Clearly these types of meta satirical humor movies just aren't my cup of tea, but it's truly hard to understand what makes people watch Seven Psychopaths and find it an engaging, interesting holistic product.",Seven Psychopaths

Marty's been struggling to get something on paper, and his next project titled SEVEN PSYCHOPATHS seems to be writing itself.This crime/comedy, channeling Quentin Tarantino, Elmore Leonard and The Coen Brothers at every turn, deals with only a few crazy people and the rest are in Marty's imagination. Scenes involving bogus situations are never distracting from the basic plot: a really bad dude (Woody Harrelson) wants his dog back, which had been kidnapped by Billy without Han's knowledge.Much of the film takes place in Los Angeles as the characters weave in an out of violent (some humorous, some not) situations – leading to a mellow stretch in the Joshua Tree desert where the three leads get unpretentiously philosophical.Farrell does a decent job in a thankless role as the main protagonist; Christopher Walken is sympathetic and, during moments of high tension, mesmerizing with his usual halting tone; while all the tasty dialog belongs to Sam Rockwell, who at times is too good a thing.But that's the underlying theme here – real loonies are a lot easier to take on paper.

89,dfle3,Very violent. Very funny. Funny violence. A lot of fun.,9,11 December 2012,"If you watch this movie based on the title alone, you might be severely disappointed. It's not a 'serious' horror movie or thriller. It's one of those self-aware movies which is aware of the genre's conventions and subverts them. Movies in this style include the great Heath Ledger work ""Two hands"" and stuff like ""Scream"" as well as the work of Quentin Tarantino and Guy Ritchie. This movie is up to or surpasses those highly entertaining and fun movies. The story concerns a script writer (Marty Faranan, played by Colin Farrell) working on an idea for a movie...called ""Seven psychopaths"", but he's not making much progress (oh, should have mentioned the great movie ""Barton Fink"" which also has story elements in common with this). Marty gets inspiration for his characters from those around him. Scenes or imagined scenes from Marty's movie are shown and sometimes the distinction between Marty's world and the world of his script disappear. Maybe the ending of the movie collapsed that distinction even more that I thought it did, but it's not like I can watch the movie again to decipher it at the time of writing.Some of the violence in this movie is extreme...like you'd see in a R rated horror movie or such like. It's not pleasant. But sometimes this violence is very funny in itself...it depends on the context. It can be absurd at times. Beyond absurd. And that's why it's often so funny. Other things which made me laugh in the movie were when Marty's friends or acquaintances (Billy, played by Sam Rockwell and Hans, played by Christopher Walken) make suggestions to Marty on how his movie should be written. Hans' suggestion started off making me laugh but then it became something more, which was a nice touch, in an otherwise jocular movie.It seems that this movie may be paradoxical (I got that impression at the end) and it also glibly pokes fun at the possibility of a 'serious' movie in Hollywood...one about seven psychopaths. It's highly amusing nonetheless. If you like absurd movies, you should love this, so long as graphic violence doesn't turn you off. If you like absurd movies within absurd movies, then you are really getting great ""two for the price of one"" value, aren't you?Recommendations:Barton Fink (for writer's block...and so much more) Two hands (whimsical thriller) Scream (for self-aware horror/thriller) The cabin in the woods (see above) Reservoir dogs/Pulp fiction (Quentin Tarantino) Lock, stock and two smoking barrels/Snatch (Guy Ritchie)",Seven Psychopaths
90,ethanbresnett,"Such a neat film, the more I think about it the more I love it!",9,17 August 2020,"Seven Psychopaths is such a great concept, almost like the love child of a Tarantino and a Coen Brothers film. It would be hard to pin down the plot in a succinct and spoiler free way, so I'll simply say its deliciously ludicrous. The film oozes character and charisma, with so much dark comedy, farce and triumphant bravado.Before going any further I have to praise the performance of Sam Rockwell. He is such a fantastic actor, and really steals the show here. He plays such an unpredictable and intriguing character, and I couldn't think of a better actor to bring him to life. Rockwell truly shines in every scene, and if for no other reason you should watch this film purely for Sam. Colin Farrell and Christopher Walken are also exquisite, as is Woody Harrelson. It really is a powerhouse of a cast, with each of them bringing their A-game.What allows these performers to shine is the razor sharp script, which is so tight and intelligent. With this, In Bruges and Three Billboards under his belt, Martin McDonagh is a certified genius in my book. This film has so many elements to it, all of which knit together neatly and compliment each other perfectly. It's such a treat to watch it unfolding.I could go on a while longer praising Seven Psychopaths, but I'll restrain myself and stop here.

Sam Rockwell (he plays crazy very well), Colin Farrell and Christopher Walken gave brilliant performances, as did Woody Harrelson and of course Bonny (the cute little Shih Tzu). Convoluted and well written, told through various dream sequences and flash-backs, and live story, it follows the writing process of Marty (Farrell) who is attempting a screenplay called ""Seven Psychopaths"" so is almost (or possibly) a story within a story. Or is it? Whilst very funny, the humour waters down the violence - this is a very bloody film; shockingly violent in places. It has nudity too but it's the language that I took exception to and I don't normally. I felt some of the language was unnecessary and didn't add anything to the story or the humour and frankly annoyed me after a while. I really enjoyed this and laughed a lot. I would recommend it but only to people I knew who were comfortable with the violence and the language as both were quite extreme and excessive for a 15 film. Brilliantly intriguing and certainly one you could see again, this really was great viewing and a fantastic hoot with intelligent humour.",Seven Psychopaths
95,nickmesafilms,Seven Psychopaths (2012) - A Tarantino Homage! Not a Tarantino Rip-Off!,10,3 November 2012,"""Seven Psychopaths"" is one of those films that succeeds with the ""Quentin Tarantino"" formula of great performances, witty story, and incredible well-written dialouge. But although the director's chair is not taken by Tarantino this time, Martin McDonagh, director of the overlooked ""In Bruges"", helps pay tribute to this formula, and Tarantino himself, as he both writes and directs this ridiculously enjoyable romp. Similar to the works of Tarantino, ""Seven Psychopaths"" is a collection of well-developed stories that involve incredibly well-written conversations between characters, and they talk about ""nothing"". But, don't worry, there's actually a story involved. In the film, Colin Farrell plays an Irish playwright who's struggling to start writing his newest screenplay called ""Seven Psychopaths"", hence the title of the film. But as he meets certain people in his life, he starts getting ideas for some characters, or psychopaths, to be in his script. Meanwhile, a few friends of the playwright, Sam Rockwell and Christopher Walken play this group of guys who kidnap dogs for a living, and they return them back to their owner, so they can win the reward money. But now, Farrell is stuck in a sticky situation in the criminal underworld, after both Rockwell and Walken accidentally steal the wrong dog, a shih-tzu, whose owner is a violent mob-gangster, played by Woody Harrelson, who will do anything to get his dog back, even if it means killing people. ""Seven Psychopaths"", although it has a few moments of disappoint, is still one of this year's unlikely better films. Writer-director Martin McDonagh brings out some fresh British comic humor, intense moments of gore, and one of the most well-written scripts of the whole year, and puts it all together into one motion picture. Throughout the film, I was consistently laughing my butt off, from start to finish. As for the acting, you cannot go wrong with any of these talented actors. Colin Farrell does great as always, delivering one of his memorable performances. Woody Harrelson is also terrific as the gangster with a deep love for his stolen shih-tzu. But the two stand-out performances come from Sam Rockwell as a psychopath who tries to make a reality out of his buddy's script, and the one and only Christopher Walken as the ""non-violent"" psychopath with a haunting past. The rest of the supporting cast also includes familiar names from Harry Dean Stanton, Olga Kurylenko, Abbie Cornish, and Tom Waits. There are some times when the gore disturbed me a little bit, and it's a little disappointing how some characters are introduced and then suddenly gone afterwards, and the 110-minute running time does drag a little. But does are luckily minor issues I have with this psychopathic flick. Although I was expecting to officially praise the film, I did end up really liking it, though! This movie does a perfectly good job of keeping tribute to the work of Tarantino, without it being a rip-off to Tarantino. The acting is phenomenal, the writing is incredible, the humor is hilarious, and the tone is surprisingly dark. ""Seven Psychopaths"" is definitely worth the time and money. ""Seven Psychopaths"", in my review, ""genuine writing and acting, a dark and gritty Tarantino tribute"".",Seven Psychopaths
96,DuskShadow,P poor attempt at a cult film,6,27 January 2016,"Well once again we are subjected to an utter lack of interest tale by the same terrible director whom did In Bruges...with lame Colin Ferrell...again.For some reason I have noticed too, that over the last 40 years, the films that Chris W. is cast in as a main character, instead of a quick bit character, are trash most of the time. Why? HEs awesome. Yet the facts stand that too much Walken, does not Chris, an inspiring, performer...make. I have seen some movies about the deranged, and known em, but this was too wannabe and the wrong kinda tongue and cheek for it. I don't know if the director was just trying to splash bits of In Bruges, Pulp fiction, Big Lebowski and something along the lines of True Romance meets Almost famous, but barf.Some things of course were sort of amusing. Such is the thinking of modern people in the US and other 1st world countries; we are all a little out there ourselves to identify with anything in a movie such as this one. Firstly to truly identify with someone whose not of "" a right mindset"", you have to have been through some things yourself. At the very least if you yourself are sane, yet have known some folks whom are more than just a little odd, you can tell this film tried too hard with the crazy ha ha. Not so funny, nah nah. Still a 6/10 is obviously not the worst rating for a film or tale in any form or format, but really, its less than bronze. Ciao kiddies.P.S. Wow IMDb...Way to not allow the word for a normal bodily function, that starts with the letter p and involves going number one.

As a captive of cult-film enthusiasts one evening after dinner last week, I was forced to watch it through to the end. All I liked about it was the backdrop of downtown L.A., a small dog, and the vintage cars employed here and there. The best I can say about the concept is that it reminded me of what a much better written parody of a Quentin Tarantino production might convey,albeit with a skilled cast.Farrell, Walken, and Harrelson have all appeared in films that did not rely on their stock personae as much as here, propped up in this turkey.

It walked the line on tone and was reminiscent of Tarantino. But better than Tarantino. He never seems to have a point in his films or fully functional characters. This movie did.Characters were quickly and clearly established with their wants and needs. There were parallel stories that were interesting and urgent. The filmmaking was a bit pedestrian.

100,squirrel_burst,Sharply written and memorable,8,12 April 2015,"""Seven Psychopaths"" offers good performances and a slew of memorable and original characters in a smart, sharply written and intelligent script. Marty (Colin Farrell) is a struggling writer who is working on a screenplay titled ""Seven Psychopaths"". His friend Billy (Sam Rockwell) decides to help Marty by having him meet real-life psychopaths through classified ads. As the two characters get wrapped up in a story where Billy and his criminal partner Hans (Christopher Walken) mess with the wrong dog in their dogknapping scheme, we meet one psychopath after another.What I liked about the movie Is that this is a truly original story that blends the fictional in-film ""Seven Psychopaths"" screenplay, the characters of the film and the film itself into a twisted, violent and funny tale. It's a black comedy so there are some moments where it gets violent and people get killed. I found myself shocked more than once as the plot took another turn or another psychopath reared his ugly head just when I thought I had the story figured out. There's a lot to like here and even if a dark comedy isn't necessarily the kind of thing you jump at, you'll have a good time with this.

If so many reviewers hadn't 'told me' this was supposed to be a comedy I never would have believed it. I wouldn't even have clocked that is was a parody of a bad gangster movie. It does alright in terms of plot development which is why it is such a dog to review. Get-it! Seriously folks, don't waste your time on this miss-hit. No, in fact it is almost quite snarky in its conceit. I left the cinema feeling like I'd been robbed and had my valuables thrown back at me because they weren't good enough.

102,akash_sebastian,Wickedly-Funny Energetic Psycho-Killer Comedy!,8,10 January 2013,"The screenplay is brilliant; it has well-written stories nicely etched together, packed with necessary violence, humour and philosophy. The writer's point-of-view narration has an effective impact in the storytelling style. A few characters could have been given more depth, but overall, it has enough depth to sustain your interest throughout the movie. The movie talks about friendship, retribution, revenge and peace.The intriguing & lovable characters, and the quick & hilarious dialogues, together make a wickedly-funny energetic psycho-killer comedy. It's not just a comedy; the stories told in between have real and different moods, with quite surreal overtones.The casting is perfect; it couldn't have been better. Sam Rockwell is the soul the movie, with his lovable oddball character saying and doing crazy things. Christopher Walken is remarkable as the brokenhearted, cravat-wearing Hans. Incredible actors like Colin Farell and Woody Harrelson support them brilliantly. (Good to see Farell in this, after the disastrous 'Total Recall' remake.) The guest appearances by Gabourey Sidibe, Michael Stuhlburg, Michael Pitt, Olga Kurylenko and Tom Waits are delightful and amusing.The concluding story of the Vietnamese guy (Psychopath No.4) was so greatly moving and awe-inspiring. It somehow touched me in a deep way; I couldn't have asked for a better ending.",Seven Psychopaths
103,williampsamuel,"Shocking, Deranged, and Hilarious",8,15 January 2015,"Watching Seven Psychopaths, I couldn't help thinking about Quinton Terantino. I don't mean this movie is filled with pop culture references or that the scenes are out of order. It doesn't have endless conversations, although the opening scene is highly reminiscent of the Cheeseburger dialog from Pulp Fiction. There is plenty of extreme violence, but that's not the main thing that creates the connection in my mind. No, Seven Psychopaths reminds me of Terantino because it's just plain nuts.How nuts? Well Christopher Walken plays Hans, an elderly pacifist who kidnaps dogs and returns them to their owners for a reward so he can pay for his wife's cancer treatments. His partner in crime is Billy, an aspiring actor with serious anger management issues and a complete lack of manners, tact, or common sense. Billy's best friend is Marty (Collin Ferrell) an alcoholic writer struggling with a screenplay called- wait for it- Seven Psychopaths. And when it turns out that Hans and Billy's latest acquisition belongs to a murderous gangster, all three find themselves in mortal danger. But it's not all bad. At least Marty will get lots of material.But none of that even begins to describe how crazy this movie and the people in it are. The people surrounding Marty are true psychopaths. Most of them aren't total Gary Busy style mad dogs, but they do and say things that make no sense, and have thought processes that no normal person has. In every situation Billy unwaveringly does the exact opposite of what common sense dictates, usually while telling anyone who objects to calm down and stop being a pussy. Harrelson's gangster is utterly ruthless and extremely violent, and will break down and cry at the thought of living without his dog. And don't even get me started on Zachariah's tale of tale of love found and lostThis whole movie has a wonderful combination of over the top violence and uproarious comedy, with the former often producing the latter. The violence is often so shocking and so unexpected, and the reactions so out of place that you can't hold back the laughter. But there are also times when it achieves just as much with deadpan humor and understatement, best embodied in the sheer drollness of Hans. And it's so unpredictable. Just when you're expecting another shootout you get dubious life's wisdom and peyote trips. There's simply no way you'll guess the ending, because it is simply insane beyond belief.What really makes this movie stand out though is its structure. With many scenes taking place entirely within Marty's script or other characters minds the filmmakers are able to introduce subplots that otherwise wouldn't fit anywhere in the story, walk through multiple possible endings, and include scenes that are beyond even this movie's logic. This movie is just nuts. And between the acting, the cast of psychopaths, and the utterly ridiculous plot, the whole experience is smart, shocking, hilarious and delightfully offbeat. Seven Psychopaths is a hell of a movie.",Seven Psychopaths
104,ghost_dog86,50 Shades of Psychopath,5,19 October 2012,"Where 2008's ""In Bruges"" saw the perfect marriage of heavy drama and rather hilarious dialogue, writer/director Martin McDonagh's newest venture ""Seven Psychopaths"" shows how easily a plot containing heavy drama and rather hilarious dialogue can all but fall apart if not perfectly structured. Starring the likes of Colin Farrell, Sam Rockwell, Woody Harrelson, Christopher Walken, Tom Waits and Abbie Cornish, the actual plot itself is kind of difficult to explain. It follows the story of a dog napping business (lead by Rockwell and Walken) a screenplay writer (played by Farrell) who has writers block, a man (also played by Walken) attempting to deal with his wife's impending death, a masked psycho killer who leaves playing cards on his victim's bodies, a Quaker who seeks out revenge on the killer of his daughter, a mafia boss (played by Harrelson) on a psychopathic quest to find his beloved Shih Tzu, a man who calls himself a serial killer of serial killers and a Vietnamese priest (no, this is not the storyline of ""Kill Bill 3""). While this synopsis may come off as overwhelming, the fact that it is riddled with such interesting characters would lead one to believe that ""Seven Psychopaths"" is peppered with immensely intriguing story lines. But one would be wrong, because instead what McDonagh has done here is preformed the cardinal sin of storytelling, by creating a plethora of story lines with characters that by the third act, nobody cares about.I cannot deny that there are more than a few laugh out loud moments here, mostly in the first act which plays out like a very clever but understated comedy. But the rest of the film, with its hyper-eccentric (but purposeless) storyline and its meandering ways, is all sorts of disappointing. So, I guess the real issue with ""Seven Psychopaths"" is that tonally it's too all over the place. During its momentary lapses of quippy-ness, the movie is very funny, and works the way it is intended. But when McDonagh attempts to create a dark atmosphere, he doesn't hold back; slicing throats, shooting people in the back of the head, burning people alive, etc. In other words, if one scene resembles an episode of ""The Odd Couple"" (very timely reference, I know) then the very next scene contains gruesome Tarantino-esque violence (but without the coolness factor) that appears to come out of a different movie entirely. And while I could say that this movie may have worked better (on every level) in the hands of a filmmaker like Quentin Tarantino, that only reinforces that fact that McDonagh is no Tarantino, and shouldn't try to be.The Star Studded Cast: Every one of the actors here is rather good in their roles, chewing every bit of scenery they can get their hands on; especially Rockwell, who is given the best lines of the film. And since a large majority of American audiences never saw ""In Bruges"", this film is sure to garner Colin Ferrell some attention from audiences who are not used to seeing him play such a neurotic character. Furthermore, the chemistry the cast has with one another (especially Farrell and Rockwell) is very watchable, and gets no complaints from me. As for Chris Walken, every critic is likely to try and say that his is the stand out performance here, as he recites diatribes in his infamous speech pattern, but in this reviewer's opinion, his character/performance in ""Seven Psychopaths"" is nothing more than a peculiar, if not rather forgettable one.Final Thought: ""Seven Psychopaths"" is the type of film that seems confused about what it wants to be, beginning as a flat out comedy (filled with witty back and forth) then quickly transforming into an ultra-violent revenge story (filled with some of the most graphic sequences I've seen outside of the horror genre in quite a while). So, while ""Seven Psychopaths"" does display moments of smart comedic brilliance, which include some of the best lines and observations of any film of 2012, far too much of this movie is a mishmash of extensive and tonally odd brutality, and men sitting around speaking in absurd non-sequiturs. And all of this is topped off by McDonagh's script, which takes an entertaining plot and careens it into a semi-nonsensical/semi-shrug inducing ending. In short, because ""Seven Psychopaths"" teeters so carelessly on the fence of self-awareness without choosing any particular side, it is sure to become (be it, rather slowly) tiresome to some audiences who were expecting to see a straight forward, crude adult comedy. Truly this is like the Coen brother movie that the Coen brothers never wanted to makebut hey, Spoiler Alert: at least there is no dog killing (just in case you were wondering after watching the commercials).Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

105,asifahsankhan,"""I don't have a drinking problem. I just like drinking.""",9,2 April 2018,"What makes Seven Psychopaths entertaining is that it does not take itself seriously in any way, and once you make your peace with that, you will definitely enjoy the film much more. Perfectly blending humour and violence.At its core, this violent crime comedy is about friendship. Marty (Colin Farrell), with a drinking problem, and Billy (Sam Rockwell and by the way this movie ends his way), drive each other crazy throughout most of the film and are complete opposites but they really do love each other like brothers. Hans (Christopher Walken), although a little weird, fits right in and the three of them bond over Marty's script, which they all take very seriously, despite the fact that an enraged gangster Charlie Costello (Woody Harrelson) is hunting them down.However, this crime comedy is not all about one-liners and outrageous moments. Those opting for a more dramatic cinematic experience will appreciate the story-telling ability of Martin McDonagh and how beautifully captivating the stories of The Quaker, The Viet Cong and The Serial Killer Killers are. These powerful stories all tell tales of revenge and retribution. It is good to sometimes put the humour aside for a moment and make your audience feel and resonate with psychopathic killers who are ultimately human.While Seven Psychopaths is not as serious as The Godfather it is definitely entertaining. The dialogue is very well-written and all the actors pull out top performances, even Tom Waits as Zachariah the creepy bunny guy. Those who enjoy crime comedies with lots of witty dialogue and gruesome violence will really enjoy this film.",Seven Psychopaths
106,mistoppi,Definitely in my Top 5 favourite movies.,10,9 May 2016,"This movie has so many strengths it seems unreal. The writing (meaning all three: the story, the characters and the dialogue), the cast, the music... Everything in this film seems to be excellent. This film is such a pleasure to watch each time. Firstly, that beginning. The dialogue is amazing, and it's extremely catching. The dialogue chosen has its risks: it might alienate the audience, but that doesn't happen. The audience watches with anticipation. The only ""bad"" thing about the beginning is these two fellows are never heard from again, so it might be deceiving the audience, but still, it's a very cool start for a film. The dialogue has some amazing qualities, some of which are tiny and basically have no meaning, but they still make the dialogue stand out. One of those little details is how whenever Sam Rockwell's character Billy repeats something he or someone else says he says it exactly the same. Yeah, that detail is tiny, but the thing is, if you have to repeat yourself, you don't always say it exactly the same, you change a few words and leave out those you don't need. I'm not exactly sure why but this fascinates me every time I see this film.The characters of this film are a strength, because every single character is interesting in their way: not just the main characters and the, what, antagonists: even those who aren't real and are actually just in Marty's movie. I want to know more about everyone, but the beautiful thing about this movie is I don't get to know anymore. I don't need that information, and all of that which isn't told is left for our imaginations. Any kind of sequel or prequel would kind of ruin that. And what makes the characters even better is that the cast is so perfect. Everyone is absolutely perfect for their roles, and no one could do that role any better. Rockwell shines as Billy, being a somewhat quirky geek with a killer intent. Farrell is absolutely perfect as Marty, and no one could do the ""scary"" gangster with a precious Shih Tzu better than Woody Harrelson!Also one of the best things about this film is how Marty is writing the film at the same time. We don't get to see Marty's film, we have no idea what kind of movie that ends up to be, apart from those few scenes given us, like the serial killer killings and the Vietnamese priest. Is the movie in this movie exactly the same? Is the film we just saw the film Marty made, or was it different? Also all the little notes on making films were amazing. I've glanced at the script of this film, and my favourite part might be when Billy reads his scene out loud and we can see that scene. In the script it was even better, considering the stuff Billy said was said twice. Also it never ceases to amaze me how when Marty says the movie's going to be violent revenge flick, but then all of a sudden it becomes just people talking, and that's what actually happens in the movie - until the final shoot down which Billy is so excited about.The most touching scene in this film that isn't actually that touching is when Hans comes up with what happens to the Vietnamese guy. It's incredible touching while it's completely separated from everything else. It's not real, not even in the sense Marty and Billy are real, that scene just is there. It's astonishing.This movie is definitely in my top 5 favourite films, alongside there with treasures such as Kill Bill, Fight Club and Pulp Fiction. Seven Psychopaths is a simple story, but it has several layers, it has ""real life"" and film. Everything about this film just seems to click. I wouldn't call it perfect - is any movie actually perfect? - but it is excellent, and if you haven't seen this one already, do yourself a favour and watch it! If you have seen it, however, watch it again, especially if it has been a while.",Seven Psychopaths
107,nesfilmreviews,"A lot of bloody fun, then falls flat",7,20 January 2013,"McDonagh's latest film, ""Seven Psychopaths,"" looks to be another over those satirical and incredibly violent action movies on the surface, but underneath it all is a surprisingly moving story about friendship. Some will say that using violence to tell a story like this is utterly hypocritical, but they are clearly not aware of McDonagh's plays, and they probably haven't even seen his previous movie, ""In Bruges."" All those works do have a high level of blood and violence in them, but they are not simply designed to shock people. McDonagh instead uses those elements to get at a deeper truth about life and the people closest to us, and this is not always apparent to those who view his work from a distance. An alcoholic writer with limited imagination, Marty (Colin Farrell) spends more time slumming with hyper pal Billy (Sam Rockwell) than he does tending to his own professional woes. Stuck trying to pen a screenplay called ""Seven Psychopaths"", Marty finds himself caught up in Billy's mess, when the latter and his associate Hans (Christopher Walken) are fingered for kidnapping the dog of ruthless mobster Charlie (Woody Harrelson). Forced to flee with the pooch in tow, Marty finds a surprising amount of inspiration in being hunted, especially given that his company, Hans and Billy, may themselves also be psychopaths. The entire film is centered around the kidnapping of Bonny, a shih tzu belonging to chief mobster Charlie (Woody Harrelson), and here's where all hell breaks loose. The violent nature of Charlie, usually involving shooting anyone he encounters without remorse trails the trio of Marty, Billy and Hans, inflicting collateral damage as he gets closer to retrieving his dog. The conversations between characters are in rapid fire, containing a wealth of information, anecdotes, and heavy on black comedy. The cast is rich in recognisable names, and that transfers smoothly into the quality of acting. This time Colin Farrell is the straight man for McDonagh (he was the opposite in ""In Bruges"") and it's just the performance the Irishman needed to deliver after the summer's lethargic ""Total Recall"" rehash. Rockwell and Walken are of tremendous value as the canine thieves, Walken bringing his turn down to a Zen whisper, while Rockwell is entertaining as hyperactively playful, despite his murderous tendencies lying just below the surface. Where "" Seven Psychopaths"" begins to unravel and lose it's way is in the third act. For the first two acts, the film is wild, exhilarating and just plain fun. The last act slows down and the tone of the film is thrown off entirely, and rather suddenly, the film ventures out of dark comedy and into the realm of something else entirely. Sure, some of the dry wit still remains - but that is about it. It irrevocably changes the film, and ultimately turns what could have been a great film into ""provides some laughs and worth checking out"". Shortly after the film begins and Farrell begins working on the screenplay, and it becomes very clear that almost every line will refer to a later theme or event. It is ingenious at first, much like most satires are. But its amusement wears thin about halfway into the film, and by the third act my interest and attention diminishes as it stumbles into a finale that feels unsatisfying. Great cast, worth checking out and entertaining enough if one can stomach the relentless carnage.",Seven Psychopaths

Pretty soon I was thinking about other things and just hoping for the end to come. Maybe something really great happened but I wasn't looking at the screen by then.

109,paudie,Less than the sum of its parts,7,8 January 2013,"Michael McDonagh's first movie as a director was the universally acclaimed ""In Bruges"" so I was looking forward to ""Seven Psychopaths"". Along with McDonagh's reputation as a writer and director the movie has an excellent cast including Colin Farrell, Christopher Walken and Sam Rockwell.However I was slightly disappointed. The movie starts slowly and I kept expecting it to ""get going"" but it never really did.Colin Farrell plays a Hollywood screenwriter who is struggling to turn an idea, a movie about seven psychopaths, into a finished script. This may be because he spends a lot of time drinking with his deadbeat friend, Sam Rockwell. Rockwell is an actor between roles and wants to help Farrell's character finish the script but makes a living by kidnapping dogs and getting rewards from their owners when they are returned. Christopher Walken plays his partner in this ""business"". In the background we hear of a series of criminals being murdered by a vigilante type killer.The dog kidnappers get in way over their heads after kidnapping the beloved dog of a mobster, played by Woody Harrelson.From here the movie switches between comedy, violence and thoughtful ruminations on friendship and the creative process but doesn't deal with any of them in a completely satisfactory way.

112,jaxbubba,Dementedly Delightful!!!!,7,17 January 2013,"An absolutely delightful sick and twisted dark comedy from the demented mind of writer, director, and producer Martin McDonagh (In Bruges). This film works on every level as its story lines span the gamut of the obtuse and the surreal, and easily rivals the warped imagination of Quentin Tarantino. The film features an all-star cast which includes Colin Farrell, Woody Harrelson, Sam Rockwell, Christopher Walken, Tom Waits, and Abbie Cornish; where multiple vignettes culminate towards the film's titillating conclusion.The film opens with Marty (Colin Farrell), a Hollywood screenwriter, suffering a serious case of writer's block. Marty has only been able to successfully come up with the title of his next project, ""Seven Psychopaths"". Marty's best friend is Billy (played by Sam Rockwell), and possibly the best thing that this film has going for it Billy makes a living stealing dogs with his partner in crime Hans (Christopher Walken), who actually returns the dogs to their rightful owners, once a reward for the lost family pet is posted. When Billy steals his girlfriend's lover's Shih Tzu, all hell breaks loose. As it turns out, the Shih Tzu belongs to a real life psychopath, Charlie (played wonderfully by Woody Harrelson). Charlie, however, is so in love with his Shih Tzu that he would go to any extreme for its return, to include killing people in order to expedite his dog's return.While the above storyline is being played out, Billy (Marty's best friend) has decided to help inspire Marty's writing by running an ad in the LA Times calling for any and all psychopaths living in the Los Angeles area wanting to have their story told on the big screen to contact Marty, at Marty's home address, which he listed in the advertisement. Also there seems to be another real life vigilante roaming the streets of Los Angeles targeting mob hit men and leaving the Jack of Diamonds as his calling card at the scene of the crimes.When Marty, Billy, and Hans flee Los Angeles in order to escape the wrath of Charlie (Harrelson); its psychopath Billy (Rockwell) who wants the film's ending to play out in a fabulous gun blaring, bullets flying, death toll rising, shoot out!!!! This film is wickedly scrumptious!!! It's fresh, exciting, vibrant, and exhilarating, and I just loved every minute of it!! It's also totally twisted, deceptively deranged, and undeniably maniacal I highly recommend this film; however, rest assured this film is not palatable to everyone's tastes. If you are a fan of the Tarantino-like film genre, then by all means take a chance on this film.

Basically the only movie I disliked more than this movie was ""Machete."" I did not find it the least bit funny, and I like Sam Peckinpah movies so I have a strong stomach for violence, and harsh language, provided of course, there is a reason for it, such as ""Running Scared"", ""2 Days In The Valley"" or ""True Romance"" Naturally, the worst part of the movie (spoilers ahead), is the ending where the cops just let Marty (Colin Farrell), retrieve a tape recorder from the murdered, Hans (Christopher Walken) because he was a friend. Give me a break, anyone ever hear of a crime scene? Not to mention how does the dog end up with him? The worst is that stupid killer with the rabbit, who calls Marty at the end and goes away? What was the entire point? Without question ZERO Stars.",Seven Psychopaths
114,jonnyfendi,Roller Coaster Storyline and Interesting Characters,7,6 February 2013,"""A person suffering from chronic mental disorder with abnormal or violent social behaviour."" That's the definition of the word of psychopath from Oxford Dictionary. Thiz movie comes from the Directors of ""In Bruges"" (2008) Martin McDonagh. McDonagh is the kind of Director who can make an effective black comedy with roller coaster storyline and interesting characters. He also shows promising signs of becoming one of the cult movie Directors. The story revolves around a psychopathic screenwriter (Colin Farrell) whose seemingly nice girlfriend is a psychopath (Abbie Cornish), makes friends with a psychopathic dog kidnapper (Sam Rockwell) and his psychopathic assistant (Christopher Walken) who unfortunately stole a shih tzu which belongs to a psychopathic gangster (Woody Harrelson) whose unfaithful girlfriend is also a psychopath (Olga Kurylenko). Meanwhile it's also about a mysterious psychopath (Tom Waits) who carries a white bunny all the time. Well, I just used the word ""psychopath"" so many times. If you feel confused, it may be true. The first 30 minutes of the movie will probably make you confused. If you feel it's kind of weird, yes, the movie is very weird and comedic as well. The dialogue is interesting and alive. Everything just flows to the right direction. And I almost feel like there is a time when thiz movie criticizes itself. The three main characters are amazing. Let's start with Colin Farrell. Farrell depicts an alcoholic screenwriter who looks like a peace lover but sometimes looks more like a coward in many situations. It's great to see Colin Farrell can bring a different kind of character. And the next one is Sam Rockwell who rocks pretty well. Rockwell's character is the one who sets fire in thiz field of gasoline. He looks confident and believable. People can hate his character but surely will love his performance. Personally, Sam Rockwell's performance is the best performance in thiz movie. Last but not least, it's Christopher Walken. Walken goes back to his roots, bringing an eccentric character, it simply reminds me what he is good at, just like the old times when he triumphed in ""True Romance"" (1993), ""Last Man Standing"" (1996) or ""Kill the Irishman"" (2011). Thiz movie just made me realize that all thiz time, most of my favorite movies has psychopathic characters in them, such as ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994), ""Fight Club"" (1999), ""Trainspotting"" (1996), ""True Romance"" (1993), ""Natural Born Killers"" (1994) and many more.

115,DanLives1980,The perfect crime comedy,10,24 April 2013,"I don't often use the word perfect, but when I do, it's necessary! I've been following this film for some time now and spreading the word, trying to get as many of my friends to watch it when they get the chance and, low and behold, they are raving in approval.'In Bruges' writer and director Martin McDonagh returns with possibly the most perfectly written, directed, filmed and acted movie that I have had the pleasure of watching in years. I say this even though I cannot compare it to the last allegedly perfect movie I saw, because goddamn it, it can't be compared. It is in a league of its own and as a true original.Marty (Colin Farrell) is an Irish scriptwriter in LA, constantly hung over, treading on eggshells around his girlfriend and hanging around with his neurotic dog-kidnapping best friend Billy. Unable to find the inspiration he needs to start his new script, aptly titled the same as the film, he is thrust into a deadly situation of unbelievable magnitude.Billy (Sam Rockwell) and his elderly friend Hans (Christopher Walken) have kidnapped the cute cuddly Shih Tzu of psycho gangster Charlie (Woody Harrelson), who will have his dog back at all costs. At the same time, saving Marty and Hans' lives before a pair of mob goons can find out the whereabout of the dog, vigilante mafia boss killer 'The Jack of Diamonds' executes the gansgters and spares the two men, who decide to grab Billy and head for the hills.But never mind wondering what he's going to do when Charlie comes back for his dog, Marty has yet to find the inspiration for his script closer to home than he has been looking as both Billy and Hans turn out to be two completely different breeds of psychopath.Without spoiling it, this film is not your run of the mill loony comedy. That's just a consistently underlying theme throughout the entire movie. What it's really about is the importance and meaning of life to many individuals and what separates the psychopaths from the seemingly ordinary folk.What was most fascinating about Seven Psychopaths is that there is more wisdom, emotional longing, vulnerability and personality in each psychopath than there is in the presumably mentally stable characters. We know they're crazy and dangerous almost from the offset but at the same time, we - and also Marty - cannot help but feel endeared towards them.So what we really have is a crime drama that is up to its ears in hilarious comedy, tragedy and deep meaning, and this to me is perfect enough before the style and the powerhouse acting takes it graciously towards the end credits.This film boasts a genius example of ideal ensemble casting which also includes an awesome turn by music legend and actor Tom Waits as Zachariah. It's also nice to see Abbie Cornish, Kevin Corrigan and Harry Dean Stanton supporting.But OH MY GOD, Christopher Walken's best in years, Sam Rockwell's best in years and Woody Harrelson's best in years. You can thank the amazing writing and cinematography but the leads do so well with their own individual and collective roles that I was captivated from beginning to end and had to watch it twice within a few short days.Excellent, through and through, go own it on DVD and never let go!",Seven Psychopaths
116,btm1,On the same high level of Pulp Fiction,10,28 January 2014,"I was drawn to this movie because I loved ""In Bruge,"" also written and directed by Martin McDonagh. It also featured Colin Farrell. (Originally, I watched ""In Bruges"" because I had visited that city not long before and climbed the bell tower where a large part of the film was shot. But ""In Bruges"" is a great film, not merely a travelogue.) In ""Seven Psychopaths"" Farrell plays a script writer who is Irish, drinks to excess, and has a germ of an idea for a film title, ""Seven Psychopaths,"" but no characters or storyline yet.""Seven Psychopaths"" was listed as a comedy; I was in the mood for a comedy. I also wanted to see Woody Harrelson's performance (he plays a psychopathic mob boss who is obsessed with his pet Shih Tzu). I first saw Harrelson merely as a comic actor in the great ""Cheers"" TV sitcom, I've since learned to respect him as a serious actor who (like Jodie Foster) seems to accept roles only in films with very good scripts. In fact, the entire ensemble consists of notable performers, including the inimical Christopher Walken as a small-time con man who collects rewards for ""finding"" and returning ""lost"" dogs to their owners. The dogs are lost because they have been kidnapped by an accomplice played by Sam Rockwell. Sam Rockwell's character, a psychopath and friend of the script writer, turns out to be the juiciest part and Rockwell plays it perfectly. Perhaps it is his performance that made me think it was the best part, but maybe not. His mannerisms brought to mind Robert Blake as Tony Baretta in the popular1970's television series ""Baretta."" Quentin Tarantino's violent comedy ""Pulp Fiction"" is one of my favorite films. ""Seven Psychopaths"" is of the same genre and, in my view, of comparable quality.",Seven Psychopaths
117,seanhmoss6,"Imagine a Tarantino movie, but more clever and entertaining",9,14 August 2019,"This is NOT a knock on Quentin Tarantino films. But this movie adjusts some Tarantino hallmarks. I can't say it ""lightens"" the mood. Rather it maintains it's mischievous dark comedic tone with lines that you could expect from a collaboration of Tarantino and MST3K. Christopher Walken, Woody Harrelson, and Sam Rockwell deliver their usual, even standard, wonderful jousting when paired with equally gifted actors. Colin Farrell gives my favorite performance of his career. As for Tom Waits, as always. he embraces and portrays the character as though it's more of an interview than an acting role. Lastly, and most importantly, writer/director Martin McDonagh sat, not in front of a typewriter or in a director's chair, but at a loom. He wove every thread, sometimes deftly, sometimes harshly, until he created the fabric that he envisioned and EVERYONE should watch.",Seven Psychopaths
118,Filmdokter,Darkly funny but not McDonagh's best,7,29 January 2021,"Martin McDonagh is a terrific scriptwriter. He combines darkly funny dialogue with highly original stories that strangely enough also gut punch you on an emotional level. Both In Bruges and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri are great examples of his talents. And although Seven Psychopaths is full of funny and morbid dialogue, it lacks a strong narrative and emotional impact. Still an entertaining movie, just not as good as the other two mentioned above",Seven Psychopaths
119,rebecca-ry,Psychotic writing,7,23 December 2012,"'Seven Psychopaths' tells the strange tale of script-writer Marty (Colin Farrell) who has writers block on his latest script which only consists of the title 'Seven Psychopaths'. With the help of his actor friend Billy (Sam Rockwell) he becomes embroiled in a dangerous adventure after Billy steals the dog of a ruthless gangster (Woody Harrelson). This is director Martin McDonagh's follow up to 'In Bruges' and has been a bit of a disappointment for some people who loved his previous film also starring Colin Farrell. Having not seen 'In Bruges', I couldn't possibly compare it with 'Seven Psychopaths' however, I was still disappointed. I was looking forward to an intelligent action comedy starring some of my favourite actors. I did laugh but not as much as expected. The film thought it was clever but it clearly wasn't. McDonagh includes funny, inward looking jokes about sloppy film writing but then thinks that it is acceptable to include these features in the film. I.e. Rockwell's character notes that female characters in films are typically treated horribly and are given no proper character – this is how all female characters in the film are treated. It does move very quickly and efficiently but the character development is all over the place; one minute you have a pair of slightly eccentric and weird men, the next they're both lunatics!Actors are outstanding in this film; Colin Farrell is great and does have really funny moments but it would have been better if his character was one of the psychopaths and not one of the normal ones. Sam Rockwell is just brilliant and he should be in films like this a lot more often – his character is hilarious, the best scene is with his reading of his suggested version of Marty's script, and this is definitely the best scene in the film and had me in tears of laughter. Christopher Walken is also great here; I've never really been a fan of his work bar his cameo in 'Pulp Fiction' but he was fantastic here as well as hilarious. There's a little cameo by none other than Harry Dean Stanton which is just excellent despite him only being on screen for ten minutes, he deserves a mention here though because it was such a surprise seeing him. Woody Harrelson was a bit of a disappointment; I think despite being the antagonist he didn't have enough screen-time – when he was on screen he was really funny but having seen him in other comedic roles such as in 'Zombieland', I was just a bit disappointed. Overall, this film is good but I was just hoping for something funnier and cleverer. Actors deserve so much credit here because their performances and hard work are what makes 'Seven Psychopaths' worthy of watching.",Seven Psychopaths

121,mdnobles19,"Smart, different but not a complete success",7,2 February 2013,"Seven Psychopaths was a fast paced, constantly entertaining, bloody, and cleverly written comedy. The film follows a screenwriter from Hollywood named Marty who is struggling to start his screenplay named Seven Psychopaths. Marty then gets inadvertently stuck in the middle of criminal shenanigans when his friend Billy and a accomplice named Hans kidnap a gangster's beloved Shih Tzu. To be honest there wasn't much point to the story and in the end you really have no food for thought. The film was a fun, witty and sometimes brilliant watch, with a great cast at their A-game.The performances were hysterical! Colin Farrell plays Marty and even if his character isn't the most dynamic of all of them, he still brings his magnetic charm, making the role not weary and dull. I got a few chuckles from watching his anti-gun character get caught up in the mess. Sam Rockwell plays Billy; an actor turned con man that messes with the wrong person. His performance is the most entertaining one of the ensembles and has the most memorable scenes. Christopher Walken is at his best here as Hans, a man taking care of his beloved wife who is dying of cancer, he helps Billy steal dogs on the side only to return them to their owner to get a cash reward to help towards medical payments. He gives a funny and touching performance. The rest of the cast are great as well such as Woody Harrelson as Charlie, a criminal gangster who is livid over the kidnapping of his beloved Shih Tzu. He gives an entertaining and cool performance as always.Director and writer, Martin McDonagh is such on a roll here and in my eyes he could be the next Quentin Tarantino, the vibes just seem similar to me. The writing was sharp, inspired, witty and wildly entertaining. The filming style was vibrant and the locations great, most notably the desert in the final shootout climax. There was a few plot holes that didn't get filled and as a whole it wasn't that balanced or had a strong point to all of the high concept mayhem that unfolded. This was clearly made for pure entertainment value and at that it worked, the whole crew seem to have a blast making this film.Overall, this was a bloody fun time. The cast was great, the writing solid, the filming slick and stylized, with a phat and entertaining soundtrack. Seven Psychopaths isn't flawless but definitely more ingenious than most comedies that Hollywood throws at us ever year.",Seven Psychopaths
122,he88,Trailer Shock,7,24 December 2013,"I think that some of those with really bad reviews about this movie probably watched the trailer and went to it basically expecting the very kind of move it was spoofing. The kind of movie with loads of senseless violence because of some made up right and wrong story. The kind of story you've seen thousands of times that will get you rooting for the side of righteousness to just blow away the bad guys. Although that was in the story it was layered as a story to show just how foolish those kind of stories really are.I thought the story was interesting and funny at times. Not a great story, but really entertaining. Some of these psychopaths like Woody Harrelson really don't need to step into character too much to play the part. They just be themselves and collect a pay check.All in all it was good acting, interesting storyline, good writing, and a step away from the same tired out stories we generally get in this genre. I think that might have more to do with the negative reviews more than anything else. Like some other reviewer stated...""It's definitely not for everyones taste""",Seven Psychopaths

124,cattjones,Reminds me of Pulp Fiction (in a way),8,18 October 2012,"I think that director Martin McDonagh may have gotten a little bit of Quentin Tarantino fever with Seven Psychopaths. This film is sure to be a cult favorite. This film is basically about a screenwriter who is struggling with coming up with material for a new film about psychopaths when he gets caught up in the violent elements of Los Angeles. The reason that they get caught up in the mess is one of the stupidest reasons ever. It is so absurd, that it makes this film very comical. With that being said this is a film within a film, so just sit back and watch the madness happen. There are some disturbing images in the film and it is peppered with retro-vision, but I have to say that I really had a great time. This film also contains future-vision which was refreshing and added some really weird humor to the film. Marty (Colin Farrell) is the struggling screenwriter who has to drag himself out of the bottle in order to get anything done. His girlfriend Kaya (Abbie Cornish) has the daunting task of having to put up with his drunkenness. Marty's best friend Bill (Sam Rockwell) is in cahoots with Hans (Christopher Walken) and these two are pretty much responsible for dragging Marty into this very strange set of circumstances. Along comes Charlie (Woody Harrelson) who is the driving force behind most of the craziness and violence. This film is mostly centered on the fellows, with the exception of Myra (Linda Bright Clay) who plays Hans' wife. She plays a major role in the ever so slight shift in the film. I have to say that I am not real fond of most violent films, but this one was so twisted that I was thoroughly entertained. There is a lot to keep track of in this film, but it is not a tough thing to do. Also, this is one of those films that when the credits start rolling, you should not want to get up too quickly. I really wish that this film was better advertised because a lot of folks are going to miss out on some exceptional movie-making. If you do not get a chance to get to the theater to see this quirky film, then definitely check it out when it comes out on DVD. I am giving this film a glaring surreal green light.",Seven Psychopaths
125,jacklmauro,Who's Counting?,3,11 March 2013,"Like so many others, I was expecting dark humor. I got a little, but mostly what I got was a self-indulgent mess where, in various scenes, you can FEEL the writer and director giving up. I was fine with the first 45 minutes because there was at least an energy and a promise of a hundred crazy loose ends coming together. It was typical modern black comedy, but that was all right. Then. It dies, going into the desert to do so. Suddenly, the extraordinary coincidences and links are randomized and abandoned (as in, how and why did Harrelson's henchman know Walken was the Quaker?). The movie becomes desperate to ride off of Rockwell's nuttiness, but it isn't nearly enough to carry us through. It isn't that you no longer know what's real or not; the characters don't seem to either, in that they alternately obey or disregard vital roles for no reason. The film seeks to get away with 'tension' in a shoot-out, but it has destroyed that possibility by presenting too much unreality, as in Harrelson showing up unarmed, or his men killing Walken in front of some very slow-moving cops. 7!! You can't have it both ways and expect your viewer to be pulled in when you'd like him to be! Sad, really. The only decent thread was the bizarre humor of the many psychos berating Marty's alcoholism. But you leave this film, ultimately, absolutely knowing that the writer got tired of trying.",Seven Psychopaths

I love seeing Woody Harrelson as a villain. Even as a villain he's always hilarious.

127,KyleLicht,Big Lebowski Meets Snatch,10,16 August 2020,"I wonder if I'll ever stop saying ""You'll never see a movie like this again"". Finishing the Martin McDonagh trilogy, this film has been on my list for a very long time. *In Bruges *was a favorite of mine in high school and sits at 51 in my Top 100 Movies list. *Three Billboards* is another recent favorite, having watched it four or five times since it came out (twice in a row when I first watched it), and sitting as my third favorite movie of all time. With my great interest in serial killer movies, I've been wanting to watch *Seven Psychopaths *for a very long time. After a recent movie bracket with my friends, I had the deciding vote of choosing *Seven Psychopaths *over *Trainspotting** (*which I've seen before). I voted for *Seven Psychopaths* for the sole reason of feeling like it's probably better, even though I hadn't seen it at the time.
Well anyway, I felt morally obligated to watch it and I've wanted to for a while now. So I watched it and stand by my choice. This is just my kind of movie. I love how meta the story is, how it revolves around psychopaths and killers, the star-studded cast, and that it's a unique movie that you never typically see. The movie is postmodern. Although it's fairly linear, it takes an unconventional story approach where a screenwriter allegorically and accidentally writes about what's happening in his own life. There's a line between what's a narrative, what's real life, and what's exaggerated, but it's not very clear. And that's what I love. Being a writer, I always incorporate myself into my work somehow. Whether I intend it or not, my beliefs and style and experiences end up formulating the story. Whether it's because I consider myself an auteur or not, I'm a human and stories aren't factory-made for me. I don't have a formula or conveyor belt. They're emotional, deep, and human in themselves. The same goes for this story. It's got the satirical elements of typical action movies but a very deep human element that questions life and morality and forces characters to look inward.
I see Martin McDonagh and the Coen Brothers in the same kind of lens. They're very similar auteurs with similar styles. They have their own ensemble, work with Carter Burwell as a composer, write about comedy crime, probe the audience with questions and deep themes, write unique postmodern stories, and are masterful in their craft. I would say McDonagh leans more into the satirical comedy aspect of reevaluating life and the Coen Brothers lean more into the confusion and chaos of the world. Overall, this film has a completely jarring and complex plot, tremendous performances, and a look into the meaning of life and dichotomy of good vs. bad.",Seven Psychopaths

131,hkauteur,HK Auteur Review - Seven Psychopaths,7,17 November 2013,"Seven Psychopaths takes its central gag similar to Spike Jonze's Adaptation in that it's about an author struggling trying to write the ideal original story, trying to avoid clichés and climatic gunfights but then at the end the author picks up a gun and shoots his way out of his problems, ironically juxtaposing the exact situations he's trying to creatively avoid. It simultaneously addresses and pokes fun at the author's eternal struggle to balance his own personal voice and the necessary components of what makes a story entertaining. So, does Seven Psychopaths bring insight to the craft of storytelling? Not exactly. Is it funny? Yes.Colin Farrell plays a good straight man and Woody Harrelson makes a hilarious villain. Sam Rockwell and Christopher Walken both balance the movie's post-modern aesthetic by adding humanity to the story. With all the post-modern cutaways, witty dialogue and crazy titles stopping the film to identify each psychopath, the movie titters on being self-indulgent but it does not because we believe their characters and care about them. The tone is balanced very well as a result and we are able to both laugh and take things seriously at the same time. Sam Rockwell steals the movie. The humanity he's able to insert into his character is impressive. Even in his craziness, we understand how his mind works and believe that he is genuinely trying to help his friend. In the hands of a lesser actor, the movie would have collapsed.Seven Psychopaths is Martin McDonagh's second feature and it shows. It's a film where the director is enjoying a bigger cast, bigger budget and more free reign. I don't have a problem with that. However, In Bruges is still the superior film. It was a deeper film about guilt and redemption and even had a metaphysical layer that explored the idea of purgatory. I still read it occasionally as a screenplay. Seven Psychopaths is a good piece of fluff and flirts with the suggestion of deeper ideas ironically to get laughs. It's really good fluff, but fluff nonetheless.For more reviews, please visit my film blog @ http://hkauteur.wordpress.com",Seven Psychopaths

If you can deal with a dark, violent film that's equal parts social satire, comedy, and near-fourth-wall breaking commentary on filmmaking/screenwriting, then this film certainly is worth a watch.The film has a creative plot and manages to pull off a twist without sacrificing rewatchability. The writing often is quite good and at times is hilarious.

But there is something really gut-level disgusting about the way human beings are treated in this film. Pointless bullet-penetrated skulls and spilled blood all over the floor is cute and funny, the way some brain-dead little boys think slicing the family cat open is cute and funny.Colin Ferrel manages to pick some of the shittiest work in mainstream Hollywood, it's like a curse that follows him.

The director Martin McDonagh, born in 1970, a successful British playwright, in his second feature film, brilliantly packs a narrative architecture of pure metacinema. The result is really interesting thanks to an impeccable screenplay written by the director himself and the choice of actors in a state of grace: Walken / Hans whose intimacy excites; Rockwell / Billy believable in his friendly madness; Farrell / Marty, screenwriter with autobiographical connotations, in search of a normal and impossible serenity; Harrelson / Charlie always perfect ""Natural Born Killer""; Waits / Zachariah already psycho of him!

135,octopusluke,Self righteous exploration of Tarantino's notebook,5,28 December 2012,"I'm in the minority who just didn't 'get' Martin McDonagh's In Bruges. The Beckettian sparse comedy fell flat, the boozed up Colin Farrell was whiny and annoying, and an otherwise reliable Brendan Gleeson stood on looking exasperated; most shocking of all was the austere Ralph Fiennes stealing the limelight as loose canon henchman Harry. Such lack of enthusiasm meant that I had little to no expectation for McDonagh's follow-up movie Seven Psychopaths. Replacing the dry British humour with crude genre parody, the acclaimed theatre playwright's second feature sees him being so nakedly reflexive about the nature of filmmaking, matched with a off-kilter genre irreverence which comes right out of the Tarantino handbook.It's the story within a story tale of Marty (Colin Farrell) a budding screenwriter with a pen in one hand, and a bottle in the other. He spends his days boozed up, slaving over a new movie project, but only able to come up with a name, 'Seven Psychopaths'. Thrown out by his discerning girlfriend (Abbie Cornish), he moves in with best friend Billy Bickle, a wisecracking punk who, along with the cravat adorning cool dude Hans (Walken), makes a living stealing dogs and returning them to distraught LA pet lovers for a hefty reward sum.Their business backfires after they wind up a Shih Tzu named Bonnie, owned by a gun toting, dangerously unstable mafioso Charlie (Harrelson). A final showdown is in order, but not before a Waiting For Godot desert hideout, a few more clichéd flashbacks and the trio bouncing around script ideas.Without trying to labour the point, Tarantino, Tarantino f'ing Tarantino. It may sound like a sweeping generalisation, but I just couldn't get his far superior films out of my head whilst watching this. It's nothing about the genre or narrative, rather the priggish, postmodernist exercise in style – mixing black comedy with bloodied violence and atypical gangster misogyny; the last of which McDonagh awkwardly tries to redeem with a knowing wink to the audience when Hans criticises Marty's script for mistreating the pointless female characters.Like Charlie Kaufman's Adaptation the reflexive screenwriter is a fantastic premise, and could have been well served within the irreverent snapshot of LA gang culture. Unfortunately, Seven Psychopaths is inflated with too many half-wit ideas, quips, stylistic nodes and, most crucially, too many damn psychopaths that the kernel of a good movie gets lost.Even still, Seven Psychopaths is still worth a look, even just for that rare glimpse of Tom Waits performing as a bunny wielding ""killer of killers"", and Christopher Walken in his total element as a dog mapper with a dark history.More reviews at www.366movies.com",Seven Psychopaths
136,Rogermex,WAY better than whatever you expect,10,1 February 2013,"I've seen a gazillion movies. Watch 'em all, except for RomComs & other assorted *hit.Seven Psychopaths is one of the best movies of the past fifty years. Trust me, it'll be on all those ""lists."" Best wacko ""blow your brains out"" cult movie since ""The Big Lebowski."" Know ""Django Unchained""? I LOVE ""Django Unchained."" It's a ""meta"" movie, extremely cleverly done. It's hilariously funny, and violent when it has to be. It's a stoner movie, in the best sense. I swear I'd pick up a lot more if I was high as a kite.One of Christopher Walken's all-time GREATEST roles! (What else do you need?) The script is SO hilarious and witty, I think I laughed at that almost more than what's on the screen.It's kind to women. It's even more kind to animals. PETA would approve.Any psychopaths out there? HELLO? Any PSYCHOPATHS out there??? This has you down, dude. A character says at one point, something along the lines of ""ya know, they're not very interesting."" Yes, the god-dam movie is FULL of psychopaths, and they're all into each other's heads, all not caring about what the next one does, all predictable and insane, all weak-kneed in the worst possible ways. I mean, if I was a PSYCHOPATH, I think this movie would FRIGHTEN me! like looking in a mirror.It's also all about the ""movie"" head-trip, like Tarantino's stuff. Just as good. You know what? MAYBE better.Recently watched ""In Bruges"" again, and it's now one at the top of my personal list. This is better.At the end, you get a scene, about one of the ""magnificent seven"" psychopaths, which places the whole thing, Buddha-like, on a whole other plane. (Yes, ""I been on lots of planes""!) This movie's a mo-fog'in trip.",Seven Psychopaths
137,Bigweight66,"It's not great, but it's not terrible.",6,6 February 2021,"Seven Psychopaths is a dark comedy revolving around a crime story. There are two stories taking place, one about a hollow screenplay and the other about a stolen dog, the stories intersect each other. There are 3 lead characters who are quite different to each other. Marty (Colin Farrell) is a writer who is having trouble with his screenplay as in he can't develop the characters or the story. Marty appears to be the most sane out of the 3 acquaintance, however he is an alcoholic. Billy (Sam Rockwell) is a loose cannon, annoying and erratic. Billy likes to try and help his friend Marty with his screenplay. Hans (Christopher Walken) is Billy's partner in crime in their crooked business of stealing peoples dogs, and then returning the dogs to the owners to collect the reward. Christopher Walken is great and the stand out performer as the stony-faced old crim. Billy and Hans steal a dog that causes them much grief. The film starts off well and is fast paced, the dialog is good, and really good in some parts. The movie gets a bit slow around the middle when the trio hit the desert, but it moves up a gear near the end. This movie try's too hard to be a weird and quirky, which takes something away from it. At times the story appears a little disjointed, but its mostly fun and interesting. The overall story is unusual and the lead characters are all interesting, and Woody Harrison is a bonus as crazed gangster.",Seven Psychopaths
138,Pzachlen,Tom Waits is the glue,10,9 April 2021,"I think that the last scene with Tom Waits informs us that what we just watched is the film of the title and that the actual end of the film is hardly the end. The Colin Farrell character will soon be dead. I've seen it quite a few times now and am amazed by the mind of this playwright and director. So many people are comparing him to Tarrentino, which I can understand but disagree. Tarrentinos films scream,""SEE HOW COOL I AM"". Everyone sounds the same as if it was penned by the same person in their dialogue.",Seven Psychopaths
139,moby1974,Gore action and funny as hell,9,11 January 2013,"Not often one of these films turn up and they normally get overlooked as its a bit of all sorts. Straight away I would say this film fits movie fans (lots of in jokes to how movies normally pan out) or to those who like a sort of....dare I say it Quentin Tarantino style movie. Its not PC, it does not hold back anything, they seem to have freedom on what went into the film and it stayed on the big screen, I mean normally they would tone it down a little with soooo many big names in a film. It does feel like a film the actors wanted to be in for the right reasons, and this seems more apparent by the budget of just $15mil, which to me is amazing seeing who is in it. The story can be brutal at times and then very funny a moment later, and all acted out brilliantly by the cast. Script/story wise I was impressed at how neat it was, the main story and the chats between the characters is both interesting/funny and at times touching. The film also falls into a strange scoring zone for me, I give it a 9 but its not a film I would buy, the reason been you get what you need from it on one showing maybe two or three tops, and though that sounds bad its not, its just I got all I needed from it and really enjoyed it. I would say go see it or rent it when it comes out, it really is a film worth seeing at least once in ya life should you be into these kind of films.",Seven Psychopaths
140,LBarlane24,Talk about a misleading poster,4,19 September 2019,"Written and directed by Martin McDonagh, Seven Psychopaths stars Colin Farrell, Sam Rockwell, Woody Harrelson, and Christopher Walken. The film revolves around Marty, a struggling screenwriter who is close friends with Billy, a secretly homicidal maniac, who, along with Hans (played by Walken), profits off of stealing dogs and returning them to their rightful owners. The trio soon hit a dead end after Billy steals a Shih Tzu that just so happens to belong to a crime-boss (played by Harrelson) named Charlie.The stuff that I liked about the film were Rockwell and Harrelson, I also loved the pitch meeting with Rockwell, Farrell, and Walken during the campfire scene in the desert; the climactic scene wasn't half bad either. Now that I've talked about my likes, it's now onto the dislikes. I'm obviously in the minority, but I found the writing in the direction in this film incredibly mediocre.My biggest gripe with the film is its treatment of the women. Now, you can argue that Walken's character does bring this up with Farrell in one scene. The thing is though, they do barely anything to improve upon this. I mean, come on, two of the actress were featured on the theatrical poster with the main cast. They were even numbered as one of the psychopaths in which the title had implyed. Having watched the movie twice though, I now know that that is in no way the case; hardley either of the actress were even in the movie. I can only describe it as false advertising.The acting itself is honestly hit or miss. Tom Waits (I can't recall what occupant his character was) spends the majority of the film whisper-mumbling, Christopher Walken looked like he was half-asleep for the most part, and Colin Farrell ... I really don't know what to make of his performance in this.Overall, Seven Psychopaths is a film that is not as funny, nor as well written, as it's been made out to be, so I'm giving it 4.7/10 stars.",Seven Psychopaths
141,jan_kalina,"""CALLING ALL PSYCHOPATHS! Are you MENTAL or DERANGED? Maybe you have been recently hospitalised but are now Okay? Or perhaps the world just doesn't understand you?""",10,31 December 2012,"That is the beginning of an ad in LA weekly placed by Billy Bickle, the best friend of the main protagonist Marty, who is a screenwriter with writer's block. He only has a title for his next movie. That title is ""Seven Psychopaths"". Billy Bickle is an unemployed actor who with another friend Hans kidnaps dogs and returns them and collects the reward. Unfirtunately, Billy kidnaps a wrong dog, a dog belonging to a gangster Charlie who loves his dog more than anything in the world and he wants him back no matter how many dead bodies he will leave behind. Billy also wants to help his friend Marty to write the screenplay by any means necessary. This all sets in motion a series of unfortunates events which are so otherworldly dark humored, violent and very funny. The director and screenwriter Martin McDonagh, is the true psychopath here. His genius seamlessly combined violence and humor in a way you have never seen. I was laughing at things I would not believe I would ever laugh at for example exploding heads and other messy stuff. This is actually a very self-aware comedy. It toys with conventions of the crime and action genres, such as the typical ""final shoot-out"" that comprises the third act of most crime and action films. Although Marty doesn't want his film to be the typical film with ""guys and guns and blood"". He wants it to be something more meaningful - about life. He instead decides his characters will drive out into the desert and have ""real, human conversations."" In the film itself, the characters decide to do exactly that – Marty, Billy and Hans drive out into the desert, and they talk. But not that all the fun would stop in the desert, that's where it all begins. Script is written in such a way that it makes fun of itself, one of the characters says something along the lines that the female characters in Marty's screenplay are horrible and not very developed, in the film itself women have very little screen time and are very quickly disposed of. Martin McDonagh assembled quite a glorious cast: Colin Farrell gives one of his best performances in previous McDonagh's film In Bruges and he does that again. Farrell just gives amazing performances when working with a fellow Irishman. Sam Rockwell simply steals the film for himself. He is just brilliant, he is just indescribably awesome. Please just give him all the awards you can for this film. Christopher Walken... well he is playing Christopher Walken, but he is one of the few men on Earth who can make audience laugh just by simply being on screen. Woody Harrelson has proved before that he can be terrifying or funny and oddball character. Here he equally mixes all these ingredients into one amazing character. Throughout the film Marty says he doesn't want typical Hollywood film with shooting, blood and exploding heads. He wants a film about life. A film which makes you laugh and at the end it makes you cry. Unexpectedly he accomplishes this almost unattainable goal and brings us the best film of 2012 and one of the best film of all time. Thank you very much for this fun film experience, Martin McDonagh.",Seven Psychopaths
142,januaryman-1,Cleverly crafted but ruined by excess,5,30 August 2013,"Is Seven Psychopaths a poorly written movie disguised as a movie about a poorly written movie or something more? The movie has an all-star cast who interact well. I thought at first that the characters were shallow, but they really aren't. Each has entertaining quirks. Most of the dialog is clever.What bothers me most about Seven Psychopaths is the incredible amount of gore and the prevalence of profanity. Gore and profanity should be used to add spice to a film. Seven Psychopaths bathes in both and the excess detracts from the film when a very reasonable amount of restraint would not have detracted from the finished product at all. The gore was at such levels that I began to wonder if the movie was some sort of pseudo-fetish snuff film. Probably just a director with poor self control indulging himself. Witness a couple of scenes with an American flag that, for some reason, annoys a character. The flag is shown later burned. This attempt at political commentary adds nothing to the movie. Even the Walken soliloquy near the end seems like political preaching about the Vietnam War. You know, the one that ended 40 years ago.The final act of Seven Psychopaths contains all manner of improbable occurrences. A character leaves a secluded desert location without drawing the attention (or even being seen) by arriving police. So many of the characters who were relentlessly developed as unredeemable sociopaths are painted with a sentimental brush complete with sappy music and photographic mugging in the films wrap-up. A main character is held up as an anti-gun hero at the end despite the movie being non-stop violence from the beginning to that point. This half-assed moralizing at the end takes on the character of one of those tiny font disclaimers. This one says, We just glorified and stylized gun violence for the past 100 minutes, but guns are really bad and even psychopaths have their good points...but guns don't.A different director, some work on the ending, and a lot less gore would have made this a much better movie. The actors and a mostly clever plot were there. What we got was less than satisfying.",Seven Psychopaths
143,aequus314,Seven Psychopaths toils with too much intellectual tripe,4,16 January 2013,"With the release of this film; Hollywood has claimed its latest casualty in Martin McDonagh—writer and director of award winning British comedy, In Bruges.Seven Psychopaths is a parody of McDonagh's life as a screenwriter; tasked to develop content for a new movie titled (no prize for guessing) ""Seven Psychopaths"". It begins with handsome alcoholic; Marty Faranon (Colin Farrell) living in his cosy, sunlit property overlooking the coast of Santa Monica. But all is not fine and dandy in Marty's life--writer's block. With a looming deadline; best friend and unemployed actor Billy Bickle (Sam Rockwell) steps in to help, hoping to provide inspiring material for Marty's research. And it is this desire to produce compelling drama for the script, that predates a string of crass and horrifying murders that Billy orchestrates for the rest of this film.As if bizarre motivation for a killing spree; the twists and turns that follow aren't ridiculous enough to throw us in for a vapid loop... enter Billy's involvement in a crime syndicate that kidnaps doggies for cash rewards. To complicate things EVEN further; Billy abducts Bonny The Shih Tzu-- prized possession of psychopathic mobster Charlie Costello (Woody Harrelson), who subsequently vows revenge.It would have been possible to examine the merits of this film's originality; and McDonagh's attempt to infuse a dose of situational parody without comparisons to metafilm, Adaptation. But awkward smugness involved in Seven Psychopath's jibes (at Hollywood's political correctness about animal cruelty and misogyny) border on too much intellectual tripe for it to work. The witty verisimilitude required to pull off such a stunt, is sorely missing.Seven Psychopaths also toils for slacker-stoner hyperbole with baffling results.

144,patomartinezfgo,A Great Script,8,30 May 2017,"Seven Psychopaths is the story of a writer who is struggling to find characters for his movie. He starts creating his characters based on the people he meets.This movie has one of the best scripts of 2012. The characters are very rounded and hilarious. And you are entertained by them just talking. It s very weird because nothing really happens in the story, it is just a series of unfortunate events (no pun intended). But they all seem very realistic and actually feel like something that could happen, even though it is completely crazy.I loved the direction of this movie. It feels like a Quentin Tarantino movie (my favourite director). And you can tell that the director is having fun with his shots.The cast is great. Everyone gives a great performances and I couldn't imagine any other person playing their character.I also love the fourth wall-breaking aspect of the film. The script in the movie kind of makes up the movie. I don't know how to explain it, but you feel like you are actually watching the script that this guy wrote, although they never actually show what he wrote.I also have some thoughts on how the portrayed the psychopaths. I am a person who is very interested in psychopathy and have studied it quite a bit. I was happy to see that the characters portrayed some characteristics of a real psychopath. But the only character I would definitely categorize as a psychopath would be ""Psychopath No.1"". He is the only that shows all of the characteristics of a psychopath and really behaves like one. I guess that doesn't bother all of the people, but I got a little bothered when someone was categorized as a psychopath just because they are killers or whatever.",Seven Psychopaths
145,mephotography2001,I Expected More Humor (Thanks to the Trailer),6,19 January 2014,"It's probably cliché to say a movie of this title is odd, but that's kind of how I felt watching it. I was looking forward to seeing Christopher Walken, Sam Rockwell and Woody Harrelson be psychopaths, and they were. Walken was fun, Woody was great and Rockwell was....psycho. Truly I didn't know what to make of his character, which makes me feel good that apparently I'm not psychopathic enough to understand him. This is really a 2 story film: the overarching tale of a writer working on a screenplay called ""Seven Psychopaths"", and a subplot about nutjobs who steal dogs in order to make money off the rewards for returning them (and dognapping the wrong psycho's dog). As the seven are introduced, sometimes it's not entirely clear if they are people in the author's world or are just figments from the screenplay. It was okay, some funny parts, some screwed-up characters, a fair amount of language and some nekkid boobage. Unfortunately the funniest part was shown in the trailer, with Walken having an exchange with an armed gunman who told him to put his hands up and he refused because ""I don't want to.""",Seven Psychopaths
146,amit_imt2002,A good follow up to In Burges!,6,14 January 2013,"I used to love psychopaths. In movies that is, until they became so commonplace that they started popping up in real life, all around me, my boss, my best friends wife, my neighbours kid.Then Hollywood solved the problem by creating sociopaths. They were what psychopaths aspired to be, so insanely sane that after hacking people in the most creative way possible they were quite likely to be declared insane.Now I love sociopaths, for example Chigurh from No Country for Old Men, that guy can give anybody the heebie jeebies.And my love affair with Hannibal Lector continues, I prefer gentlemen like him to many normal folks I have around me.Being eaten be him would be an interesting way to die, far better than passing away in a hospital, a sticky bed pan under your bum.Now I would have thought Seven Psychopaths would still not add up to one genuine socio but the director Martin McDonagh has other ideas.He directed the outstanding In Burges about two hit men holed up in a Belgian tourist town after a botched job.He returns this time with a film about an ensemble of crazy guys that is more of a satire on the entire process by which Hollywood tries to keep jaded cine-goer's from suffering a fatal psycho fatigue.Colin Farrel is ""Marty""( an obvious wink to Scorsese who has given us so many memorable ones) trying to write a script.All he has is a title, ""Seven Psychopaths"", in Hollywood that's enough to sustain the dreams of many wannabe writers for years.His friend Billy (Sam Rockwell) is a dog kidnapper who aspires to co-write with him(another Hollywood fantasy), and whose friend in turn is Christopher Walken, his dog kidnapping accomplice. The ""mcguffin "" here is a dog stolen from bad guy Woody Harrelson who is Hollywood's most dependable psychopath. Harrelson says he was cast by Oliver Stone in the cult film Natural Born Killers because Stone saw the violence inside him.Woody Harrelson can appear on the edge even when he is playing a romantic school teacher.That's how unhinged he is.But this is a Sam Rockwell show all the way.We know from the trailer already that the dog will be the bone of contention.I have a bone to pick with trailers but that's another psycho story.And so round and round it goes till we lose count of the psychos on screen, even though Mr. McDonagh has a counter running on-screen.The ride is full of in-jokes on Hollywood, you can totally see the director having fun while writing this. This is a kind of anti-Tarantino film, written with a sense of reversing the balance between humour and violence.It's also pretty self-conscious in a positive way, the characters behave as if they are in a movie.When I was growing up (and I still am), I used to hear it being said that everyone has one book in them.In todays world everyone feels they have at least one film in them, some may even feel that they have one film of each genre each in them, at least this is what appears to be the case in Hollywood.And that idea that you heard between drinks from a stranger in a bar and used in your script can come back to hound you as a copyright issue or much worse a psycho stalker.There is a Vietnamese monk in this film, who looses his marbles in the Vietnam War and comes to America to avenge the massacre of his family. He is dressed as a priest sitting in a motel room with a half naked hooker.Its an interesting image.He has been thought up by Marty and goes through many rewrites each one more inventive and improbable than the other.The Zodiac killer makes an appearance too, David Fincher tried to find him in all his seriousness in his film Zodiac, here he meets his end at the hands of a pair of Bonnie and Clyde type vigilante ""serial killer"" killers.He has a Mahatma Gandhi portrait hanging in his living room, and when he burns to death Gandhi is still smiling benignly.Billy tells Marty, ""Gandhi was wrong,""an eye for an eye"" does not make the world blind, there will still be one guy left with one eye, and then how will the blind guy take out his last eye, the fella with one eye will just have to scurry behind a bush and save himself"".Now thats the kind of demented thinking that makes this film a crazy riot. See it at your own peril, the rewards are as varied as the seven psychopaths on show here.",Seven Psychopaths
147,Davidon80,Mind blowing,6,5 February 2013,"On paper this movie had so much going for it: follow up to In Bruges by director McDonagh, a cast to die for in Farrell, Walken, Rockwell, Waits, Harrelson and to top it all it had a title like Seven Psychopaths, how could this go wrong? Well lets start with the plot. A dog knapper kidnaps a gangster's dog and said gangster tries to hunt him down. Also there is a sub plot which becomes the main story about a writer writing a script about Seven Psychopaths and also there is a serial killer loose who kills gangsters and mob types. Whilst this is all happening the movie shifts in and out of narrative strands as we see the story within the story unfold along with the cleverer story about the story. Oh and there is a satirical jab at genre conventions in Hollywood movies and a third plot strand involving a Vietnamese monk. Confused?? It's not that confusing is it?? What the movie in it's entirety is trying to achieve is the writer's fiction genre with guns. Think of movies like Get Shorty or Adaptation whereby we have movie and story of the movie merging into one and you get a good idea at what McDonagh was trying here. The sad fact is, like many movies in this genre (bar the movies already mentioned) they often fail to hit the right notes with audiences because they become entwined in their own convoluted plot structure. Which is the net result of Seven Psychopaths. A movie which tries to be so many things it ends up failing at all of them. While a part of me want to applaud McDonagh for being original and having the wit to challenge audiences, another part feels that everything that McDonagh is trying to say in this movie seems to contradict what he puts on the screen. Why have a smart movie about Hollywood conventions when your movie and the characters in your movie aspire to classic dumb Hollywood clichés? Why have a two subplots pertaining to higher aspirations of art and existentialism when your main story is about a gangster looking for a dog? Overall a decent movie to past the time with but one which will leave you unfulfilled.",Seven Psychopaths

150,benkitching13,"Ruthlessly entertaining, exceeded expectations.",8,9 December 2017,"8.5/10 for clarification.Seven Psychopaths is a gloriously dark, often uproariously laughable crime thriller/comedy that exceeds both the critical and public receptions by considerable margins.It is worth initially noting that Psychopaths is not a picture for the faint of heart, and serves as one of the most apologetically violent and gruesome films I have ever seen. However, the spouts of bloodshed (largely presented in a darkly comedic context)are accomplished and render Psychopaths such a remarkably enthralling experience.Other users of the site have commented glowing endorsements on the performances of the lead roles, and whilst I am (to some extent) inclined to agree with that feedback, I can't dilute my feeling that the performances were trivially lacking.For the vast majority of it's run time, Psychopaths consistently delivers a commendably high quality experience, riddled with enticingly dark humour and quotable dialogue. Despite this, the final chapter pertains to being a little more hollow than it's accompanying section and minutely diminishes the quality of the film as a whole.Without a shadow of a doubt; Psychopaths deserves praise for it's non linear structure which consists of a plethora of plot twists, flashbacks and deviations into the backstories of the numerous ""Psychopaths"".The picture has on numerous occasions been compared to the films of Quentin Tarantino, and accurately so as both revel in their extended sequences of dialogue, graphic depictions of violence and non linear storytelling elements. I believe it's appropriate to say that the quality of Psychopaths is equivalent to that of Inglorious Basterds and Django Unchained (and edges towards Pulp Fiction), though it falls short of the impeccable bar raised by Reservoir Dogs.",Seven Psychopaths

Unfortunately this is a movie that thinks it's much more clever than it really is. It's like Adaptation with a dash of Tarantino but written poorly. They try to have events in the movie blend with a movie script Colin Farrell's character is trying to write, and it just ends up a mess. Also, from the very beginning you can't help but feel like this is a Tarantino wanna be, with violence mixed in with humor. It just doesn't take though. Farrell, Walken, and Rockwell are all fine but aren't really asked to do anything special. Woody Harrelson is kind of quirky but other than that the characters are pretty flat. Near the end the script just becomes absurd and the movie feels like it's 30 minutes too long even though it's under two hours. Take a pass on this one. It undervalues the actors performing in it and the writer isn't as creative as he'd have you believe.

That's up to us Movie lovers and professional/-non professional critics.Plot: guy with writer's block turns haywire in pursuit of a worthy story by involving his friends with the screenplay and his friends not being who he thought they were made the Writing process hazardous, add to that a sentimental crook whose dog is being ransomed by one of the writer's friends.Yeah, everybody turns Quentin these Days. Not everyone succeeds, but McDonagh does. So what is a Tarantino Movie? Well, the base is great dialog and quirky carachters, and the use of one or two present day screen stars and a whole bunch of peripheral, half forgotten but excellent ones.See this one if you like Tarantinoesque Movies, although it does stand on its own too.I give it 8 out of 10 because it is not a see-several-times-over kind of Movie.",Seven Psychopaths
159,richcarter1962,This Is Not for Everyone,8,29 January 2013,"There is little doubt that this movie is not for everyone. If don't believe it just look at some of the reviews, lot's of 1's and lot's of 10's, me I am somewhere in the middle, (towards the 10 end). It is not for everyone because it is QUIRKY and I do mean quirky, with lesser talented actors I could well be one of the people giving it 1 star, however the acting was excellent. I have been big fan of Sam Rockwells, since the Green Mile and in Seven he is hilarious. Colin Farrell, was great and as usual Christopher Walken was superb. Mickey Rourke was originally cast in the Woody Harrelson part, and while he did a good job, I think the character might have been better suited to Mickey Roarke. There something about Woody playing a character that is way over the top, that feels like he's playing it way over the top, none the less he was still funny.This movie was full of hilarious one liners, and some very smart dialog, the plot was at the same time funny and ridiculous. I read a few of the reviewers that slammed this movie and most of them were bashing the plot or the lack thereof, this is not a great who done it, and I will agree the plot was paper thin, at best.If you see this movie you need to see it for the acting and a fun way to spend 110 minutes.

160,anthony-burton4,Pulp Fiction without Quentin Tarantino,4,3 October 2013,"From the first scene, it was clear that this movie was trying to emulate Pulp Fiction - initially I thought it might stand a chance at being at least an entertaining clone, but it became quickly apparent that in lieu of a clever plot and a wonderful script, they were going to entertain the audience with shock tactics and gore. I quickly revised my expectations to put it into the same sort of category as the last Die Hard... then the boredom set in.... this movie is SLOW.Basically it can't make it's mind up what it wants to be - I'm guessing the script writers and producers felt they were producing a Pulp Fiction clone, and nobody along the way pointed out their limitations. There is not one single memorable line or scene. Not a single character in this movie was believable - they were each clearly very contrived characters rather than exaggerated stereotypes (which is where PF succeeded). I suspect that it will appeal to people who find movies like Due Date funny, but if you're expecting a clever film, think again. If you were to equate Pulp Fiction with From Dusk Till Dawn, then this movie would sit alongside From Dusk Till Dawn 2.",Seven Psychopaths

162,alexdelliott,"""It's got layers""",8,6 November 2012,"I really have to praise the film industry for giving me this film. I saw it at the cinema during my trip to the US last week and and after seeing the trailer I was expecting to be let down by a poor attempt to copy old school Tarantino films. What I got instead was a hilarious original film which (to quote Hans) has layers. STORYIt centres around a guy trying to write a screenplay about seven psychopaths and how he takes inspiration from real characters he meets on the way. This is the main story line but there are many sub-plots that continuously come into play. Not much can be said about the story without spoiling the actual events but believe me when I say that nothing in here is generic or has been done before. The developers went for a more intelligent style of film and it really played out well. It never becomes generic for a second without something wild happening to keep it all fresh. It becomes a parody of Hollywood films and clichés in all genres which is what makes it so unique and a great film. 5/5EXECUTIONWith a good cast the film is acted exceptionally well from start to finish with even the lesser characters really showing their skills. Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell definitely stole their scenes. This film is really dialogue heavy which will not be for you if you like to see lots of action with cars exploding and epic battles. Those are all things the film attempts to parody and pulls off so well. The use of long takes by the director are great at achieving the atmosphere the film looks for. Again everything about the film's style is completely original and so the developers are to be commended for their efforts to do something new. 5/5VERDICTAs I said I saw this film in the US, my only complaint is that I have to wait until December before I can actually talk about it with people here in the UK. Anyway, I would say this is a film for both critics and also for people looking for a more intellectual film and are tired of films just being dull copies of successful titles. If you want a film about a ""tough guy"" who ""lets his gun do the talking"" taking on hoards of enemies with slow motion and CGI effects then seriously don't see this film. But if, like me you are just fed up with that then see this film it manages to parody all the things you hate in film and is completely original and free of any clichés. Thank you film industry for finally giving me what I want without screwing it up. 5/5 + 5/5 = 10/10",Seven Psychopaths

Unfortunately for people like me (and evidently we're in the minority here), it was over-the-top saturated with bloody violent scenes!I love the line-up of stars, whose performances were flawless! ... Colin Ferrell plays the lone anchor in a sea of psychos. Christopher Walken, always a quirky character, is both entertaining and endearing as the heart of the group, and more troubled than psychopathic. Sam Rockwell does a great psychopath on a mission, with remorseless, yet boyish, joie de vivre. And of course, Woody Harrelson has ""crazy"" down to a fine art, exhibiting a true psychopathic charisma that has you vacillating between hating him and liking him. The writing is brilliant. There is never a dull moment. Normally, that would be enough for me to rave about a movie to everyone I know. But the film left me feeling rather like I had gone through a gauntlet.

So i thought , OK he has a good taste , and its going to be an original and funny ""little"" gem. Unfortunately i was wrong. It simply doesn't have ""it"" , the pulse , the magnet to grab its audience , it doesn't have it... You just watch it and its a mediocre experience , no comments to make , no interest to show in its characters or anything. To tell you the truth i have kind of an obsession and before watching a film i have to check its IMDb rating , and thats precisely what i did with this movie. I saw 8/10 , and i thought OK , a good director , a perfect cast and a good IMDb rating!! no lose case. But no it was less than what i expected . Not a good film , not a bad , and not a good cinema choice . In other words you better not pay a cinema ticket to go watch it.

Seven Psychopaths is very character-driven, so while each of the actors do their bit it never comes together. Perhaps it's a problem with the direction or editing, but the movie relies too heavily on being quirky. As such it just becomes a muddled mess where all you have to rely on is the very absurdity of the various roles.

It had some of the same dark humor and general psychopathic behavior of course, but outside of that they weren't very similar. In Bruges was so much better just because it was so much better balanced. It balanced comedy, absurdity, drama, emotion, and action. Seven Psychopaths was just basically balls to the wall madness. Tons of violence, non sensical dialogue, and general chaos. I was amused at parts but ultimately found it all too much and over the top to enjoy. The best comparison would be a lesser Snatch from Guy Ritchie. This was definitely closer to things like Snatch or Rock n Rolla then anything from the Coen brothers. But even Snatch and Rock n Rolla managed to pace themselves better and be more focused than Seven Psychopaths. I really liked Snatch and Rock n Rolla and I only mildly enjoyed Seven Psychopaths.

But the poor editing and stupid screenplay gave Walken et al not much to do but mug. There is so much grimacing, so many exaggerated facial tics - perhaps McDonagh thinks this is the fastest way to say ""crazy"" - that the characters feel more like the Three Stooges with heavy weapons than real lunatics. Walken, always the more clever actor and a master at stealing a scene, chooses to mostly stare straight ahead while Farrell and Rockwell, who appear to be competing at The Jim Carrey Make-A-Face Festival, are making fools of themselves - and steals the entire movie. And what is the point of the brutal treatment and heavy-handed objectifying of the women? What's with the extremely offensive scene with Gabourey Sidibe?

As the screenplay progresses, Marty gets tangled in all sorts of weird events that make him find the psychopaths around him.Colin Farrell shows a different spectrum of acting in this dark comedy piece, presenting himself as an everyday man that gets tangled in mysterious events rather than the action heavy roles he is known for and even though the action revolves around him, he observers, almost as if he is the one with the audience watching the film, the only normal person there. Marty and his friends even predict what is going to happen by figuring out a good story of the script, in a way the script becomes reality right before our eyes.Although the film uses dark humour, the comedy is seen throughout no matter how graphic or brutal some of it may be, therefore the film works as a good, yet predictable dark comedy, with a fair point to it.

This immediately put too high an onus on all involved as I consider it difficult for a film using this plot device to succeed.Also as the film continually jumped in and out of events in the story and the steadily progressing screenplay it was often difficult to follow and this problem was exacerbated by large portions of the plot dragging for interminable periods of time.Most parts were played well by their respective actors but after stellar reviews I expected more.,Seven Psychopaths
176,david_hokey_16,Had so much potential,4,31 August 2017,"I get where this movie is coming from. It has witty dialogue and is meant to be campy and nonsensical but while retaining a driven story. I've seen films do this and succeed. This film, with its various characters and their intertwining stories, had a lot of potential. But it failed. I'm not too surprised to see so many people lauding it as brilliant. It can be fun at times and as I said it has some witty dialogue but other than that it's just a failed repeat of what I've seen in better films. Yeah, the movie is self-aware - it knows it's a movie hence the camp - but none of it really culminates into a worthwhile story. The actors do a decent job but there's nothing special in their performances. Farrell and Rockwell are supposed to drive the film but they lack chemistry which could be purposeful as it's one seemingly normal man realizing his friend is deranged. But it doesn't come off as organic and let me say this - a movie can be campy and nonsensical and flashy and still have its characters come off as organic. This film failed. I'd say it's just an average film with nothing particularly outstanding about it. However, after the introduction of the, ahem, six psychopaths it gets really boring as absolutely nothing happens until the end of the film. And we don't have characters who are likable enough to provide us with the entertainment we need during this large portion of the film so, ultimately, in my eyes this means it isn't just an average film - it's a bad film. Maybe so because it had so much potential that others somehow saw come to life yet all I saw was a lack of such great development which left feeling gypped.",Seven Psychopaths
177,Kings_Requiem,The genius of McDonagh,9,23 March 2015,"For those that haven't seen it yet... Don't let this get lost in the shuffle. Yes, Argo is great and Sinister is whatever, but Seven Psychopaths deserves a lot of love too. The cast is excellent, the screenplay is fantastic, and its hilarious. Rockwell and Walken are the standouts, but most of the key players get their time to shine. Martin McDonagh definitely knows how to handle dark comedy. He's 2 for 2 in that department, first with In Bruges and now with Seven Psychopaths. His movies have a pretty melancholic feel to them, almost like there's some higher force at work here. Despite all the violence and shitty people there are definitely a lot of underlying themes. Now these are bad people, but they have layers to them. They may be psychopaths but each one has feelings and purpose. Marty (Farrell) just wants to write his screenplay without having to show all the violence, Billy (Rockwell) just wants to see that shootout, Hans (Walken) just wants to be with his wife, Zachariah (Waits) just wants his name in the credits of Martin's movie, and Charlie (Harrelson) just wants his f**king dog back. So they're just people like everyone else...they all may be a little crazy and some may resort to violence, but it's all for the greater good and its never without reason. Anyone who was a fan of In Bruges will definitely find a lot to like about Seven Psychopaths. All the violence and melancholy is intact, but I would say that this one is the funnier picture. Don't put too much stock in the trailers for this one as they are pretty misleading, just as the ones for In Bruges were. So definitely make plans to see it...you won't be disappointed.",Seven Psychopaths
178,Thomasamills,Cruella DeVille Has Nothing On These Dog Nappers,8,12 December 2012,"Just how do you follow up such a cult hit as big as 'In Bruges'? This was the question for writer/director Martin McDonagn who has not released a film since earning his Oscar for the brilliant 'In Bruges'. His answer to this question involves his former 'In Bruges' college Colin Farrell along with an all star cast, lots of funny one liners, plenty of violence and one missing Shih Tzu.'Seven Psychopaths' revolves around a struggling screenwriter called Marty (Farrell) and his involvement with his sort of best friend Billy (Sam Rockwell). Billy and his friend Hans (Christopher Walken) are in the dog napping business. They steal dogs in the park, and then claim the reward from the owner. Between the two of them, they just about have everything under control. This is until one of the dogs stolen belongs to a gangster called Charlie (Woody Harrelson), who wants his Shih Tzu back by any means necessary. These events drag Marty into a world of crime, violence and death, that he had only before wrote about on paper.The thing that works wonderfully with 'Seven Psychopaths' are the characters and how the script focuses on them as individuals and doesn't drop them into the story. It's very easy for a film to have a great plot and just drop in an action hero and a villain, but McDonagn cares about these characters and everything that happens during the film is because of the their actions and personalities. The way the film was played out reminded me of 'Killing Them Softly', which was not a film about gangsters and hit men killing each other, but about the actual people themselves.Just like 'In Bruges', McDonagn has added plenty of dark humour and brilliantly funny one-liners into the script. The opening scene involves two gangsters discussing if John Dillinger was shot in the eye or not. This instantly reminded me of the conversations between Ray and Ken from 'In Bruges' or Vincent and Jules from 'Pulp Fiction'. The dialogue throughout is wonderfully engaging and full of memorable quotes.Whilst Farrell and Harrelson are on top form, it's Rockwell and Walken who steal the show. Everybody loves watching Christopher Walken and this is by far his best performance in years. He provides most the films laughs and also gains the audiences sympathy, without changing his character too much. Anyone who has seen 'Moon' from 2009 will know that Rockwell should have been nominated for best actor at the Oscars, but it never happened. Surely he will receive a best supporting actor nomination for his performance in 'Seven Psychopaths'. He portrays one the smartest idiots I think I've ever seen on film, and emerges into the role so well.One Problem with the film is the amount of characters. With 'In Bruges', McDonagn was able to give the two lead characters lots of depth as we spent the whole film with them. Whilst all the characters are well laid out in 'Seven Psychopaths', I couldn't help but feel that some were more interesting then others, and that I would have been interested to know more about minor characters. In particular Charlies girlfriend played by Ola Kurylenko. However, McDoaghn backs himself up with a speech by Marty in which he explains the lack of women in films today and how they are used for either sex or to be killed.'Seven Psychopaths' is ludicrously entertaining from start to finish, smartly written and directed and full of great performances. Whilst I may prefer 'In Bruges, McDonagn proves that he is not just a one trick pony and I can't wait to see what he does next.",Seven Psychopaths

I mean I did not want to see this movie, in fact I passed this one up to see Rise Of The Guardians at one stage. Why? well an apparent dark and twisted comedy just didn't look that funny. I have been wrong before, and I am yet again.Seven psychopaths tells the story of a struggling screen writer who through-out the mundane events in life has lacked the activity of the pen. Based in Los Angeles, Marty (Colin Farrell) is mind-set on creating a love story, with a touch of violence. The movie? seven psychopaths. Although a writers block refrains him from lifting off, it seems a designated plot comes round when friends Billy (Sam Rockwell) and Hans (Christopher Walken) steal a Shih-Tzu from the wrong guy.Running a corruption business that involves a rob and return routine, the guys are unaware of the gangster reputation behind Charlie (Woody Harrelson). Marty gets caught up inadvertently, leaving a mess that he Billy and Hans must clean up (to stay alive).The introduction to McDonagh's four year return immediately describes the sheer madness to come. Seven psychopaths is hilariously gory and extremely unpredictable. Marty is an alcoholic character who is centred as the main character and carries a storyline that could have done without his presence; maybe it was the Irish accent I couldn't take to? I have seen Colin in some decent flicks, but his original-self didn't blend so well with the other characters.The characters of both Walken and Sam Rockwell give this movie the psychotic premise the critics are labelling it as. The comedic performance from Rockwell is the highlight of a movie narrated so well by Farrell, but I simply didn't fancy is performance. The bloody graphics and Harrelson's bipolar villain is enough to convince you.This might sound crazy but the movie appeared made up the longer it went on. I felt that way because it was that crazy. The wonderful concept is yet again the dark and twisted humor, offering some cracking dialog between certain characters, particularly Hans who, behind his criminal lifestyle cares for his cancer stricken wife.Overall: Seven Psychopaths is one of the most surprisingly enjoyable movies of 2012. With quite an original concept, and a fine cast of veterans, it is a nice send off to what was a fantastic year at the movies.8/10 For more of my reviews visit - http://gerrysreviewsforthosecurious.blogspot.ie/",Seven Psychopaths
185,payupyou,Don't take yourself so seriously----,8,24 December 2019,"----no one else does--- one of my favorite things to tell the haters.Trying not to give away any spoilers -- you have to watch this with an open mind looking to be entertained and not educated. Huge cast all the way to Tom Waites (who by the way, can do no wrong).
The characters fit together and interact well. Although it's not the script of the decade, it is ""playful"".
If I get into the characters and their roles I'll spill the beans. But I have to comment about Tom Waites (did I mention he can do no wrong?). He had an integral role in this film which I doubt many viewers really recognized and was flawlessly executed with the rhythm of an accomplished musician.So take these two things from my review and relate them not just to this film but film in general - and even life;

He wants that it wouldn't be about just usual shootouts (to which his friend Billy disagrees). He needs inspiration and apparently it is not so easy to find it as psychopaths are not so common in his life. OK, WASN'T so common in his life. It's kind of like movieception because Seven Psycopaths is about a guy trying to write a script for a movie called Seven Psycopaths. Maybe the writer also had some of this experience? I have to get a look at it.Is this a usual Hollywood movie? I think so. It is a crime comedy I could say. About some of the most dangerous people on Earth - psychopaths. But the topic is carried out lightly and you can see that most of the psychopaths become this way because of good wishes - somebody wants to help somebody, somebody kills just bad guys. Of course, even in good causes murder is not the solution.This movie had some surprises that I didn't expect and I like to be surprised in movies (I hate it when they are predictable).

189,seangores,Bland but Introspective,5,10 November 2013,"I watched this movie expecting a psychological thriller, but Seven Psychopaths was nothing close. It's a movie about writing a movie, a very ""meta"" topic. But don't get your hopes up; Seven Psychopaths fails to meet expectations. The movie is packed with unnecessary violence, gore, and even some nudity. The scenes are uneventful for the most part; the scenes that do further the story are packed with gruesome violence and only make you feel more confused.The plot is complicated, but the order of events they are shown to us is even more confusing. The idea is great in concept: psychopaths contributing to the screenplay of an upcoming movie. A movie about a movie. But we are ""shown"" the script, with the characters of the main story playing those characters in the script, as the characters in the (real) movie ""discover"" the ideas. If this sounds a lot like ""flashback"" confusion -- or the dreaded ""Man of Steel"" effect, you're not too far off.To be honest, I watched this movie with my family because my mom liked all the actors. But though the acting was ""sub-par"", the screen-writing was boring and uneventful. My family all agreed that the movie was ""strange"", and not in a good way.I would caution viewers to reconsider watching this movie; alternatively, viewers may wish to ""gloss by"" the boring parts or the blood and nudity. Five loaded flare guns out of ten.",Seven Psychopaths

Well, luckily this movie had 'em both, in a quite good balance!""Seven Psychopaths"" might not be easy for a girl to watch or for someone who has been addicted to typical Hollywood comedies. Without a doubt the film's strongest advantage is its razor sharp script and of course the cast. I really cannot imagine a film with such a story without Sam Rockwell. Farrell, Walken and Harrelson also performed amazingly. The cinematography was good, too.Perhaps the blood and all the killings in the movie are a little bit exaggerated. However, their comic tone adds a lot to the final result. And the result is an original, entertaining piece. In my humble opinion, one of the best recent comedies.",Seven Psychopaths
191,jdneukom,Bonny the Shih Tzu for Best Supporting Dog,9,13 February 2013,"It is unclear to me why people feel compelled to compare this to a Tarantino flick, as if it being a closer match should garner it a higher rating. Frankly, this is better than anything Tarantino has done in quite some time. The script and dialogue for SEVEN PSYCHOPATHS can hold it's own against anything Tarantino has ever directed, PULP FICTION included.I'm struggling to think of a single part of the movie that I didn't enjoy--still struggling--struggling--OK, well maybe they carried on a bit too long at the Joshua Tree National Park? That's really all I can come up with.Christopher Walken was Amazing and this is one of his best performances in that last 20 years. He gives all you'd expect and more from a movie with psychopaths in the title. He plays his patented strangely and powerfully occult role with aplomb. I was momentarily taken back to THE DEER HUNTER as Walken's Hans sat across from Woody Harrelson's Charlie in the cravat scene. The way Walken ""out-aggressived"" the aggressor really provided for a fantastic scene.Sam Rockwell is also excellent as really the co-lead actor here. Collin Farrell was fine as the lead, but I'm glad his role was the more passive type as to yield Rockwell and Walken (along with a game Woody Harrelson) near full control of a screenplay that cuts like a knife.To be this entertaining (not really a dull moment), this unpredictable, with this witty of a dialogue, this humorous and grotesque all at once, while offering a scathing satire about the Hollywood experience (the meta-Hollywood satire involving women--either they are scantily clad or minimized, and the satire involving violence and clichéd screen writing) in a single film is simply a tour de force. Throw in great acting and a really solid, yet simple soundtrack that supports the film but never overwhelms...and you have a complete picture.Trying to recall some of the funny, interesting, and fresh moments...-obviously the opening scene-the fact that there is an organized dog-abduction ring just to get reward money-the sight of what you think might be a Buddhist monk, until you see the vestment and the random topless, white babe in the scene (who happens to be perfectly fluent in Vietnamese)-nearly any of Walken's lines-the Buddhist, no Amish, no Quaker psychopath!-Bonny's collar-the clichéd, yet fresh stories of the Quaker and the killer and also the serial killer killers (the lady removing one inmate's head at the neck via hacksaw was so over-the-top gruesome yet fantastically funny and non-offensive somehow)TL;DR: Bottom line is, if you want to watch something different and quirky where the story may not be all that serious, but it's at least witty and unpredictable, then you will LOVE this film. Great laughs, lots of comedic gore, plenty of white rabbits (no, really), and a role that Christopher Walken was born to play makes me give this movie thumbs way up.",Seven Psychopaths
192,mistramicizia,Better than I expected it would be,9,7 July 2018,"Previously having mixed opinions on this film before I watched, I've got to say it surprised me with its originality and fun characters. This movie quite certainly proves Martin McDonagh is one of the best directors out there, and whenever he makes a film (which is not so often), he does it in style. Unique and somewhat strange storytelling, mixed with great performances from Colin Farell, Sam Rockwell, Woody Harrelson and Christopher Walken, is what makes this one of the best British (by a British director) movies. Although, if you're asking me, it felt different than Three Billboards and In Bruges (which is in a good way, and empshasizing McDonagh's wide range of ideas and expressions). Underrated and not much discussed, I would definitely recommend this movie, which pretty much has a little bit of everything.DISCLAIMER : Everything stated in this review is entirely matter of personal opinion and doesn't have to coincide with the opinions of other reviewers",Seven Psychopaths
193,jodenband21,About seven times more fun!,9,9 January 2013,"""Seven Psychopaths"" is another crime-cum-comedy film bolstered with great cast ensemble that develops a strange connection on one another. It is a movie within a movie; it's strange that we can't see another film like this anytime soon. I'm giving it a praise for it is an exercise of lifestyle and self-awareness that whatever you do must rely on things that are motivating.Colin Farrell is Marty Faranan, a screenwriter who suffers in writer's block. He needs an idea, maybe an inspiration for his screenplay, which is also titled Seven Psychopaths. He has some ideas, but only occurs as a dream sequence. His friend Billy Bickle (Sam Rockwell) is an unemployed actor and part-time dognapper, eagers to help him with his screenplay. Both of this guys is very funny, in a weird way. Billy's friend Hans Kieslowski (Christopher Walken) is a Jesus-freak man who aids him to kidnap dogs and earn the money as a reward for bringing it back. The reason for this is that his Negroe wife Myra (Linda Bright Clay) is a cancer patient. Whether it's a gimmick crime or for the benefit of his wife, the business is good.Not for long, a cold-blooded gangster named Charlie (Woody Harrelson) lost his beloved Shih Tzu named Billy. Charlie suspects that it is Hans who stole the dog because he's the man who's returning a kidnapped dog back to the owners. The goose-chase initiates after a suspected Jack the Diamond serial killer executes Charlie's men, and the trio hides somewhere in the Saharan desert where the film will rest for the action. A quite concern is that viewers may find this dull and long.Here's a film that harness such serious craftsmanship. Any film, which is also about a film takes a good patient and ample timing to deliver the actual goods. In this case, the film is self-aware and knows that it is a movie. Other supporting actors includes Abbie Cornish as Kaya, Tom Waits as Zachariah Rigby, and Olga Kurylenko as Angela. There's no good and bad with their performance. Although, it could've been enjoyable enough for us to get to know them better, especially Olga's role as Charlie's girlfriend.It takes long time for the film to reveal its true purpose for the characters. But the director, Martin McDonagh knows how to develop certain slow-burn and whimsy dialogues and gruesome moments for us to enjoy the film enough. However, some may get bored within the second and third act. Just think of it as a Tarantino film, the script is patient but the payoff is irresistible.",Seven Psychopaths

196,stuartkpark,"Great, but not as expected",9,28 December 2012,"Marty is trying to write a screenplay called 'Seven Psychopaths'. He is helped by his 'friends' who turn out to be actual psychopaths which Marty slowly discovers as the film progresses. Each character has their own ideas on how the screenplay should read, to the point of acting out the scenes to make their point. Some of his psychopath friends kidnap dogs and return them a few days later for the reward, unfortunately one of the kidnapped dogs happens to belong to Charlie (yet another psychopath) who is prepared to do anything to get back his beloved Shih Tzu.The film is essentially a comedy crime caper, but it avoids the stereotypes and doesn't play out quite as expected. I imagined some over-the-top-ness similar to Zombieland, but this was more toned down (apart from a few scenes) to the point of almost being reserved. This is no bad thing as it allowed room for the characters to develop and interact. This also gave more emphasis to the script which was sharp, dark and truly funny.The cast featured some big names such as Colin Farrell, Sam Rockwell, Christopher Walken and Woody Harrelson, amongst others. No one character was elevated into the spotlight and all seemed happy to bounce off each other. All the cast put in a great performance, but Sam Rockwell probably had the most fun character and it showed, a very close second was Woody Harrelson who plays a no-nonsense tough guy very well (Natural Born Killers, Zomblieland).My only criticism would be the flow, some bits were quite jumpy without a natural order or progression. However, this is only Martin McDonagh's second film so I'll let him off! That said his first film was 'In Bruges', which is also superb. Certainly a writer and director to watch for in the future. Seven Psychopaths will certainly be in my top ten for 2012.",Seven Psychopaths
197,davidnhewko,"I was thinking more like 8.5, that's just not an option.",8,14 March 2013,"Mindset before movie: What a cast! Sam Rockell! Christopher Walken! Woody Harrelson! That other guy, oh, Farrell. Never been a huge fan of Farrell, except ""Horrible Bosses"", he just seemed to fit that character so perfectly... As soon as I heard about ""Seven Psychopaths"" and its cast I decided I wanted this movie to be one of those ones where I avoid previews and reviews because I don't want to know what to expect. I just want to maintain my blind faith and hope for the best. Expectations were high but relatively reserved.Mindset after movie: Wow. I definitely didn't think it was gonna be THAT good. This movie is a great example of why I like these actors. I felt they all did what they do best; act like a bunch of psychopaths! Walken, Harrelson and Rockwell hit all levels of batpoop crazy. I fell in love with these actors all over again...except Farrell(I think it's the eyebrows, they're suspicious). This movie had it all; I laughed, I cried, I cheered and I was kinda caught off guard by how amazing and innovative the writing was. I was so sucked into this movie, I didn't get up once and those 2 hours went by very fast. I want you to know this is only my opinion. I seriously believe whats going through your head before and during the movie directly affects your viewing experience. For me I kept my hopes reserved low which usually leads me to being blown away by any movie, it's kind of like what happened to me with ""Blade 2"" (the last time I watched it, I couldn't remember why I liked it so much when it first came out...oh yeah, the first Blade). But every which way I re-analyze what I watched it was awesome.If you're like me, a man with common sense and a little bit of psychopathness mixed in, you will love this movie. The acting was great (it's really easy to look beyond all the Colin Farrell), the story was surprising and there was some sweet action mixed in there. What else do you need? Guys: Will probably like this if they have half a brain.Girls: Will also like it if THEY have half a brain.

However I think the film really starts to decline from there as the movie tries to something different by subverting what you'd expect in a movie like this but in the end is let down by basically everything in the film from the acting to the writing and even just the plot really. 6 might be a bit harsh and is probably marking my disappointment for a movie from a director who made one of my favourite films but a 6/10 isn't really that bad, it's still a decent flick.

However the film is quite predictable, and so that reactions of the characters and not be so funny. I'm not saying that the whole movie boring and predictable, there are parts that will you laugh. What I still did not like in the movie is that it is Woody Harrelson could better play its role. He definitely fits the role of a gangster psychopaths which is only concerned with their dog, which is not a problem to kill anyone who gets in his way, if something happens to him.

Like In Bruges it mixes (cynical) humour and introspection well, but the script flutters into many directions. This is the point of course, with the story involving a script writer trying to find his story. But in watching the movie there is also a slight loss of focus. The cast is great, with wonderful (big and small) roles by Christopher Walken, Harry Dean Stanton, Tom Waits, Woody Harrelson. Also worth noting is that Martin McDonagh seems to get the best out of Colin Farrell, who both here and in In Bruges is better than in some of his other roles.",Seven Psychopaths
205,seanhimdb,"Disappointing in a Cat Stevens ""Foreigner"" kind of way",2,3 February 2013,"So disappointing.As another reviewer put it: ""a half-assed Guy Ritchie version of Adaptation."" Novels about writers, movies about movie people, must seem Terribly Interesting to those creating them, or perhaps to those bankrolling them. Otherwise, why do they do them? Once upon a time it happened to novelists. The first novel, a gritty and realistic drama set in the poverty of the working class environment of the writer's background, is a great success, and propels the author to fame and a little fortune. He moves to a comfortable estate in the Home Counties (if England - not sure what's the US equivalent) and his second novel is a boring diatribe about being a moderately successful writer living in comfortable circumstances and suffering from Writer's Block while trying to start/complete his second novel. And of course, it flops.Now we have a film maker who creates a highly original and entertaining indie movie, and gets the backing to move to Hollywood and do one for the big studios. And he lounges in the way too bright California sunshine and drinks way too much and struggles to complete the screenplay by the studio's deadline.Seemingly the same thing can befall successful recording artists: I'm reminded of Cat Steven's album ""Foreigner"", recorded in Jamaica, following several very successful studio albums recorded in England.At the time, I concluded that he must have had a lovely time in Jamaica spending the studio's advance, then woke up one day realizing that he'd run out of time and money and still hadn't recorded anything, so rushed into the studio and dashed off whatever he could.Seven Psychopaths is a Cat Stevens ""Foreigner"" kind of movie.",Seven Psychopaths

Both Six Shooter and In Bruges are very unusual and creative additions to the genre. Unfortunately, I was left slightly disappointed by Seven Psychopaths. Although the film is very original and undoubtedly enjoyable it left me feeling a little let down by Martin McDonagh. The film lacked the character development of McDonagh's previous work. Which is a crime when the film has cast with actors of the calibre of Colin Farrell, Christopher Walken and Woody Harrelson. The film is one of the most original of the year. But in my opinion could have and perhaps should have been one of the best films of the year.

This was such a ridiculous and entertaining film that I'm almost cracking up just recalling lines and scenes from it. One thing that amazed me was how strong the comedic dialog was I think I will be quoting this film for a long time to come.The whole plot, if you can call it that, is that Sam Rockwell kidnaps Woody Harrelson's dog, up till now him and his partner Christopher Walken have been using this to hold the dogs for a while and then get rewards when they return them. Unfortunately they weren't aware of the fact that the dog was owned by Pyschopathic Woody Harrelson which could put them in a world of trouble, Colin Farrell, Sam's screenwriter pal finds himself caught in the middle of all this of which he isn't particularly excited about. And they wind up having some crazy hijinks. One thing I admire about the film is it tries to be different it goes so far as to have the characters blatantly telegraph the ending of the film a while before it happens. The film is trying to be different than your average mass market crime film, and it is.The only thing I don't like about this film is it has a weird disjointed nature to it. It seemed like sometimes the characters would be sitting around in a scene with nothing to do for a few minutes before we finally got the plot, thats really my only complaint everything else can be forgiven by the uniqueness of the film.""Seven Pyschopaths"" manages to have a great cast, with obvious sight gags, shockingly dark humor, witty subtle humor, it has that sort of ""Napoleon Dynamite"" factor where when you watch it you think ""well this is different"" of course ""Seven Pyschopaths"" is a million times more violent and obscene than Dynamite ever got, but nonetheless Psychopaths manages to be funny, epic, serious, and even a little enigmatic and dare I say it ""Life affirming"" ""Seven Pyschopaths"" is a trip off the beaten path and I highly recommend it.",Seven Psychopaths
209,gt-thereelword,A Mixed Bag,6,22 November 2012,"McDonagh's comedy/thriller is a kaleidoscope of ideas and themes wrapped around a simple story. This won't be a film for everyone. The humor is extremely dark and at times quite disturbing. If you can laugh at a woman sawing a man's head off whilst he is still alive then this might be for you. Admittedly, nothing in this film is meant to be taken too seriously. The script has some pretty funny moments and some great one-liners that you'll want to write down and quote to your friends.The main problem is McDonagh's scattershot approach. The script is so full of stories, sketches, ideas and existential discussions that it doesn't give you time to focus on or care about anything in particular. McDonagh's lucky to have such a talented cast here. Colin Farrell, Sam Rockwell, Christopher Walken and Woody Harrelson are all fantastic. They are a pleasure to watch and make even the most self-reverential scene still entertaining.The movie's a little too smart for it's own good. It's one of those screenwriter-makes-a-movie-about-how-he-can't-write-a-movie movies that was done much better in Charlie Kaufman's Adaptation. This review may be sounding a little too harsh. The truth is there are many good factors to be enjoyed here and Seven Psychopaths will no doubt gather itself a huge following.

210,jorn-truyen,Hilarious and original,7,18 May 2014,"Hilarious! that's the first word that popped to mind when watching 'Seven Psychopaths' again. Martin McDonagh's dark comedy didn't really convince me the first time, but the second view was rewarding. Marty (Colin Farrell) is a booze-addled screenwriter, struggling with his new script called 'Seven Psychopaths'. He doesn't want it to be another ultraviolent thriller, but rather a film about peace. His friend Billy, portrayed by Sam Rockwell, is a dog-kidnapper who turns about to be a psychopath himself (Jack O' Diamonds). The same goes for his partner in crime, Hans (Christopher Walken). They infuriate a gangster (Woody Harrelson) by kidnapping his Shih-Tzu. As the film develops, the situation hurdles towards a violent climax, exactly what Marty didn't want for his script. A great aspect of the film is its playing with mise en abyme and metafiction. While Marty is writing, the characters in the movie influence his script so that the movie we are watching changes. It isn't the first time that metafiction has been explored but McDonagh's approach is certainly original to some extent.Similar to 'In Bruges', a second view makes you aware of funny details and remarks which you missed the first time. McDonagh clearly has a feel for comedic timing and dialogues are once again memorable, which is of course largely due to the excellent cast. Especially Sam Rockwell adeptly plays a creepy killer and at the same time a likable character.There are two aspects of the film that I found disturbing to some extent. Firstly, its lack of (noteworthy) female characters, and secondly the ending, which is in a way similar to the ending of Spike Jonze's 'Adapation'. However, these remarks are negligible in comparison to the overall excellent story. All in all, it is an interesting film which will perhaps be recognised as a cult-hit in the recent future.",Seven Psychopaths
211,frenchjuice,Shootouts + Ghandi + VD = hilarious,8,10 June 2015,"The Seven Psycopaths, directed by criminally underrated Martin McDonagh, stars Collin Ferrell, Christopher Walken, Sam Rcokwell (my favourite) and Woody Harrelson. The story of the Seven Psycopaths follows Collin Ferrell as he tries to write a screenplay called ""Seven Psychopaths."" It's gory, it's clever and most importantly it is very very funny. The tone of the movie sets immediately from the very first scene where two guys talk about getting shot in the eye. From there the story crescendos and slowly introduces to us to the Seven Psycopaths. One of the more clever part of the movie comes from it's phenomenal writing. Line after line, hilariocity ensues, and almost every line in this movie is memorable. As well it sets up and pays off very nicely and foreshadows when you least expect it, to truly see the genius of the writing, a second viewing is a necessity.This movie also feels like every single character steals the scene, Woody Harrelson, the one who plays a mafia boss is very good at interchanges from a psycopath that could psyco-kill you to a shi-Zhou lover in a blink of an eye. Christopher Walken is great as always as he once again creates a character that you wonder if it was purely made for him, However, to me it's Sam Rockwell's character, the dangerous, violent and yet kind- hearted Billy Bickle, that stays on my mind the most. Every actor dons his character perfectly, and we as the audience can clearly enjoy it. Seven Psycopaths is one of my favourite movies, but it does saddens me that nobody I know has watched it.

212,noahlenzi,One of the most underrated films ever,9,12 September 2017,"Seven Psychopaths is one of the most misunderstood poorly marked brilliant films ever made. With a trailer that resembles more of an Ocean's 11 movie, it pulled the entirely wrong audience. This movie will resonate primarily with storytellers and writers but its a dark comedy full of meta humor and commentary on what Hollywood continues crapping out today. As a beginning screenwriter in college I found the plot based around the Seven Psychopaths screenplay to be hilariously relatable in an odd way. The script for the film itself is full of hilarious character moments and clever dialogue. I can only dream of writing something this good.The performances are all top notch with each actor clearly understanding the tone in which the director was going for. Sam Rockwell is the stand out though, this is my personal favorite role of his. He's like the part of us that just wants a film to be fun and demented while Colin Farrell's character struggles to make a thoughtful and meaningful story. The story is almost like the characters' struggle to figure out what kind of film they're in. An author meeting his own characters only to realize he's one of them as well. Its super meta and really fun if you're open to the careful pacing it takes. This is not an action movie. Its more of a dark comedy/drama. Do not, I repeat, do not watch the trailer for this film. Its a completely misleading attempt to market the film as an action comedy. This film spends time with its characters and completely earns every moment that have.Seven Psychopaths is one of my favorite films and should be viewed by more people who love everything about movies. This movie is a fun time and feels very inclusive to its audience. Its really the best written comedy just ahead of The Big Lebowski. Please give it a watch whenever you can.",Seven Psychopaths

After seeing enough spurting blood scenes to turn my stomach and sicken me, I turned it off. I won't subject myself to vile visuals in hopes that it is going to turn around and improve and end up being a masterpiece. It was filled with well known actors, so I would have had hopes that it had some redeeming merit, but I certainly didn't see any hopes of it. Maybe someone's cup of tea, but not mine.

That's not it at all! In fact ""Seven Psychopaths"" is beautiful! Yup you read right. This movie was a beautiful work of art and was extremely well made. It was made with pure taste and poetry. It has a little bit of violence, comedy, heart and a whole lot of WTF! This is a fun ride!Jack ""The Film Lover"" says... At first I saw the trailer and I thought, oh great another ""Snatch"" or ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""Big Trouble"" what's that? Oh you don't know about ""Big Trouble""? It stars Tim Allen. It's a funny little flick. So when I went in to watch ""Seven Psychopaths"" I went in with a certain expectation and thankfully I was wrong. The movie is a poem. It goes up and down, and it has a nice flow and balance. This is a fun and realistic ride.There are parts in it that you laugh out loud and then you think to yourself ""Was that supposed to be funny? Am I the Eighth Psychopath?"" You are in it with them.Jack ""The Filmmaker"" says Let's talk about writing. You need a story, characters and dialogue. Now throw all that away and start fresh. Put in characters that have nothing to do with the story. Create stories that have nothing to do with the characters or at least make the audience think that. Because when you unveil the truths and show that everything ties together in a nice neat and perfect ending you've got yourself a work of art. You might even call it poetry on screen.Now let's talk about actors. Actors that have fun playing their roles make it easy to have fun watching them. I have never felt that way about Colin Farrell before. I actually had no feelings about him until this movie and he nailed it. Christopher Walken always brings his best and Woody Harrelson who is one of the most underrated actors of our time was scary good. Who did I forget? Oh yeah Wild Bill himself Mr. Sam Rockwell, who I never really liked because every time I saw him I saw the character he played in ""The Green Mile"". (If you haven't seen that film you have not lived.) But Sam stole the show in this. This team did a great job! It did have some weirdness about the editing and pace of some scenes and a lot of the environments and wide shots took away from the main points of what was happening at some points. Jack ""The Parent"" says No kids PERIOD! Teens are good because they will get some jokes and laugh at the violence but no kids In fact don't even have them be in the house while you are watching it. No it's not that bad with the violence. Or is it?",Seven Psychopaths

Is not the funniest film I watched but it definitely have some good parts, it was entertaining. I didn't want to see this movie because when I first listen the plot about 7 crazy people that steal dogs and blah blah I was expecting a stupid film and it is (-_-) but it has a cool story, more than one but they mixed very well all of them and make something good here, the performances are really good and believable with a good screenplay.www.facebook.com/elementarytips",Seven Psychopaths

218,JP_Shay,Unfunny Unoriginal Miscast Mess,2,1 August 2016,"Martin McDonagh's ""Seven Psychopaths"" is literally one of the weirdest films I have ever seen. I can't say that I liked it. I thought the use of black humour was unnecessary and unoriginal. It seemed like it borrowed a lot from Tarantino, and its never good when a ""Tarantino-esque"" film fails to deliver. I actually liked McDonagh's previous film ""In Bruges"". The script was one of the best I ever read and movie was genuinely funny and seemed original ""Seven Psychopaths"" lacked so much. It is one of the most horribly miscast films I have ever seen - how am I supposed to NOT like Woody Harrelson? The actors were not right for the roles. Colin Farrell absolutely sucked as the lead. He is an actor I like in most things, but his performance in this was just terrible. Christopher Walken had some funny moments but even he couldn't save the film. Sam Rockwell was too over-the-top but the scene where he is describing his idea for a movie shootout is hilarious and my favorite part of the film. But mostly he was just annoying. ""Seven Psychopaths"" had its moments but falls very short for me. Some of the minor cast were good but it could have been better with more convincing lead cast and better writing. I will not be watching it again. Errr, the annoying soundtrack is still playing in my head!",Seven Psychopaths
219,workingclasshero,Pulp Fiction for the very poor,2,16 December 2012,"At times like this, when I see a movie like 7 psychos rated almost 8 at IMDb, a deep sense of despair overcomes me. Are people really that easy to entertain and to fool? Is that really all people want? The first scene says it all: two strange guys talking strange things, apparently they are killers. Pulp fiction, here we come. It's gonna be great. The next 30 minutes, you are faced with a string of senseless dialog and some weirdos doing weird stuff. OK, it's gonna be hilarious soon, you think. The all-explaining twist is only seconds away, when all will make sense and the ultimate wittiness of it all becomes obvious.But it never comes. It just goes on with one pointless scene after the next. Some people get killed in a disturbing way. And because it's disturbing and doesn't make sense, it must be funny *somehow*, mustn't it? No, it must not. Bad movies are just bad movies, no matter what the authors intentions were. There's not a single character in the movie that deserves any emotional consideration whatsoever (not even the dog). I feel kind of bad writing this review. Usually when people say only negative things about a movie, they didn't really understand it and are just expressing their frustration with a hate review. But I understand quite well what the movie was trying to be, and I would have really wanted it to succeed, just like Pulp Fiction did in a strange but great way, or like the weird but always well thought-through stuff Charlie Kaufmann writes. But the simple truth here is: the author had no real idea for a movie, so they went for a movie about movie making, threw in seven psychos, and a few murders, and some weird talking that could be mistaken for some sort of philosophical pondering, and hoped for an audience that doesn't make the mistake of bringing a brain with them. Apparently, at least in the latter they succeeded.",Seven Psychopaths
220,nick.johnson,No redeeming qualities,4,22 October 2012,"This movie is kind of a mess from the beginning. Sometimes it's clear when a scene is a flashback or someone telling a story, but other times it's not. The lines are definitely blurred enough that it's hard to follow what you're seeing. That might have been OK if there were some redeeming qualities in it, but I couldn't really find any. To be honest I walked out after about an hour, so it's possible that the ending was much better, but it's hard to imagine how the ending could have made up for the hour I did see.In addition to the silly plot, the violence in this movie is somehow cartoonish and extremely graphic at the same time. To call it gratuitous would be an understatement. There are so many gory deaths (even just in the first hour!) that I lost count. There was hardly any character development and very little reasons were given to care about anyone on the screen. It seemed that the primary reason for the violence was to prove that these people were psychopaths.I enjoyed this writer/director's last movie ""In Bruges"". This one isn't even in the same league.",Seven Psychopaths

The characters were all given enough amount of screen time as they deserved. The plot was very well handled considering it had so much story and so many characters. I never felt something was missing. I cannot elaborate on the story because you HAVE TO see it to know it. It's just one of those movies. I can just tell you, you won't regret it. The ending made perfect sense to me and so did the entire movie, but I did read a few IMDb reviews where people are not, I guess satisfied or maybe the trailer showed it as a spoof movie, which it is so not. This is a genuinely well thought out crime movie with dark humor. For me though it was a perfect 10.",Seven Psychopaths

How wrong I was! Sure, I was tired when I started to watch it, and rapidly getting more tired as the movie (did not) progress. I really don't get this movie, had it not been for the gore, I think an audience of 10 y.o. would be appropriate. Come on! Is this where it has come to?Meaningless, stupid & silly...

224,i-rispin,Profoundly Disappointing,2,2 November 2013,"The film's one real coherence is in its cinematic depiction of writer's block. For that achievement I award a star. You know that something's going to be rubbish when it's about someone trying to write something.The second star goes to Christopher Walken for being watchable here, as he is everywhere else.The plot is all over the place and the attempts at humour do not really hit the mark. The whole film reeks of someone scrabbling about for an idea and never really finding one. This lack of substance should have been picked up in pre- production and the project called off for want of a story. The sad thing is that I have been blown away by the two other pieces that I have seen written by Martin McDonough, The Beauty Queen of Leenane (play) and In Bruges.",Seven Psychopaths
225,Coolaj56,An unusual erratic mess,6,11 March 2019,"Writer/director Martin McDonagh had a few good ideas, that he then tried to pack with other random stuff to fill out a movie. It gets heavily self-referential and satirical, but ultimately so much of this film feels half-baked. The main characters are each fairly interesting, and their backstories are as well, but the backstories don't make sense for the characters. So they each feel more like characters on a page, than like real people. I suppose the perils of a satire is that you can't take anything seriously. And McDonagh just goes with that and doesn't want you take anything seriously...until things do get serious.
There are several pieces of this movie that are excellent, such as the interview with Zachariah (Tom Waits), and the scene in the hospital room near the end. Those were great serious moments that didn't fit into the rest of the movie, but worked well on their own. The final product feels like a season of a TV show, where some of the episodes are great, others are mediocre, and each attempt to pull it all together just falls flat.
Some people may contend that the random plot and tonal inconsistencies are all intentional, which may be so. But just because something was intentional, doesn't mean it was a good decision. And this film has a lot of bad decisions mixed in with some great ideas.",Seven Psychopaths
226,withloveandviol,What a script!,9,5 May 2020,"You get a good idea right away of what kind of film you're about to watch when an unknown character walks up and point-blank range shoots two people.When reviewing/watching films like this, it's really difficult not be biased when you already really like some of the actors. Sam Rockwell is a personal favourite, and I've seen most of his stuff and cannot fault any of it. The casting of him against Christopher Walken, Colin Farrell and Woody Harrelson in this is absolutely perfect and given that Farrell and McDonagh have already worked together on In Bruges (2008) it's easy to see why he was cast again in a similar role.The script, and those who deliver it, is so flawless a lot of the film seems ad-libbed. A scene in the desert when Rockwell is explaining the potential ending to Farrell's book seems so natural, that even after researching online, there is no mention that this isn't fully scripted.One of my personal favourite aspects is the interlinking historically 'accurate' short stories throughout the main plot, which in themselves are well thought out and well written. One references the Zodiac killer (who was prominent between 1968-1969, killing up to 37 victims and who to this day remains unidentified). McDonagh goes deeper and presents the double-edged plot of the Vietnamese monk, who served under the Viet Cong who returns to his village of My Lai (which was home to one of the most horrific incidents of violence against unarmed civilians during the Vietnam War where a company of American soldiers brutally killed most of the people in 1968) to eventually portraying the monk as Thích Quang Duc (who was the first Buddhist monk to perform self-immolation in Saigon to protest the persecution of Buddhists by the South Vietnamese government led by Ngo Dình Diem.)For a black comedy, such as Seven Psychopaths to reference such prominent historical events truly shows the intelligence of the writer/director, which has since been proven by the creation - and subsequent awards - for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri in 2017.I've watched this film a number of times already and will continue to do so, enjoying it just as much as the first time around.",Seven Psychopaths
227,bugandlolly,Absolutely brilliant!,10,24 July 2014,"This is absolutely one of my favorite films ever! That said I should add that it is certainly not for everyone. It is extremely violent and the violence is graphic and in several cases, disturbing. I am not a fan of violence in films, in fact quite the opposite, but ""Seven Psychopaths"" is such an unusual story, told in such an unusual way, that it did not bother me. And the performances! WOW! Sam Rockwell is one of my favorite actors and his portrayal of Billy is just electric. It has ""layers"". He manages to take what truly could be a reprehensible character and give him loads of charm and pathos. I was in Billy's corner the whole way through. And Christopher Walken! I mean really, come on, CHRISTOPHER WALKEN! He is just so good, so funny, so perfect. Walken and Rockwell together, it doesn't get better than that! The story is convoluted, intricate and completely hysterical. This film could easily have been a mess and in less capable hands it probably would have been but ""Seven Psychopaths"" shines. It is utterly unique and absolutely brilliant. Did I mention I loved it?",Seven Psychopaths
228,brendanfoy,I want to like it more than I did,5,13 February 2013,"Seven Psychopaths is a black comedy, and comedy is highly subjective with black comedy even more so. I was loving this movie as a throwback to the violent yet humorous crime thrillers of the 1990s, most of which were written or directly inspired by Tarantino.Seven Psychopaths plays out like a true homage to those classic Tarantino style flicks with witty dialogue, quick and sudden acts of violence, and colorful characters you just can't help but like despite their severe problems. Sam Rockwell is fabulous, Colin Farrell nails it, and both Woody Harrelson and Christopher Walken are at the top of their game and combined with a strong first act the movie takes off from start like a rocket. About halfway through the film, just as everything seems like it's coming together, the true nature of the script reveals itself and in my opinion falls apart. What was a fantastic recreation of a classic genre turned into a parody of the genre, and as the movie progressed it became increasingly self aware until it was a parody of itself. The plot and characters became increasingly ridiculous and over the top, but since the movie is now a comedy you're supposed to be OK with that. I wasn't, but I wanted to be; I just wasn't feeling the shift in direction.There aren't seven psychopaths whose stories intertwine to serve a greater narrative, there are actually only six, with one being a dream (and boring), the other a marginal character who I would have liked to have seen more of, and yet another only seen briefly. It's really a story about 3 psychopaths, and the Colin Farrell screenwriter character becomes the focus, but he got duller the more I got to know him. Once the movie slipped into self parody territory, where the characters joked about genre clichés such as final shoot outs, graphic violence, and how women are depicted yet did all these things anyway I found myself bored. I was disappointed for a similar reason I was disappointed with Charlie Kaufman's Adaptation, where the script was clearly self aware of filmmaking clichés, so it joked about them only to end up doing them anyway. I would have preferred Seven Psychopaths been more sincere to the genre and actually tried to do something different, or didn't and just further developed its plot and characters while providing the laughs through witty dialogue and clever staged violence. I laugh much more watching True Romance and Pulp Fiction. Perhaps the best joke towards the end of this film was that reading Noam Chomsky would provide for intelligent conversation.My mixed feelings on this movie remind me of No Country for Old Men, where I was absolutely glued to the screen for the first half, but completely turned off by the second half where it became a completely different movie. I understand that Seven Psychopaths, Adaptation, and No Country for Old Men are all critical darlings, and I do recommend you check out this film for what it is, but I'm writing this review for those who are of like mind - you're not alone.",Seven Psychopaths

230,erdenerenerdem,Christopher Walken is brilliant,10,3 February 2013,"I watched this movie last week and I am still returning to re watch because it contains some of the most fascinating scenes I have ever watched. I think the casting was very good. Sam Rockwell, who had already pulled off a slowly degrading and paranoid character living in moon alone, really succeeds in bearing the weight of the story. He is essentially causes almost all the progress single handedly and the parts really fit together.Colin Farrell, who is a favorite of the director is another good flavor but I didn't really get impressed with his acting or his character. Because his character has almost no impact, he is dragged along to different situations and usually has no bearing in the movie. Maybe it supposed to represent the director in some level but it is very interesting to see the story teller who doesn't even realize how little control he has on his own story.But I am mainly reviewing this title to praise Christopher Walken. Every one of is scenes are perfect, he is just brilliant. I have always liked him but I could never imagine that I would be impressed this much with his acting. I think the character is very interesting, his dialogs really fit the atmosphere and in general it was a very essential part of a good story.",Seven Psychopaths
231,melina-m-gunnett,Good writing and good acting - violence throughout.,8,9 October 2012,"After watching the trailer, I expected Seven Psychopaths to be about the zany antics of a group of dog nappers as they are pursued by the psychopaths they stole their dogs from. While dogs were napped and antics did ensue, that was only part of the plot.The real story is that of Marty (Colin Farrell), a writer, struggling to finish his screen play which is, not coincidentally, titled ""Seven Psychopaths. Billy (Sam Rockwell), Marty's dog-napping best friend, wants to help. Unfortunately, his help just might get Marty killed.Seven Psychopaths was written and directed by Martin McDonagh (In Bruges, Six Shooter). The films style reminded me of Quintin Tarantino's movies, especially in McDonagh's use of the aestheticization of violence throughout, and I would not be surprised to see McDonagh list him as one of his influences.The characters in the movie balance between the uncaring psychopathic ruthlessness and devoted dedication to the things they have decided to love and McDonagh has gathered an all star ensemble (Colin Farrell, Sam Rockwell, Woody Harrelson, Christopher Walken, Tom Waits, Abbie Cornish and Olga Kurylenko) to portray them. Harrelson is at his psychotic best and Walken's dead pan performance was ideal for the role of Hans, Billy's dog-napping partner.Seven Psychopaths is the story of the story being written and it is done well. McDonagh allows Marty's life to become a mockery of the script he is trying to write without turning the film into a complete farce. Each psychopath has their own tale and they are all brought together in, sometimes, unexpected ways. While the movie is filled with chaos, all the pieces are also brought together and somehow, it all works and works well.I enjoyed Seven Psychopaths and suspect this film will be finding a place on my video rack when it comes out on DVD.",Seven Psychopaths

Very clever and the dialogue is as good as it gets. If you're a Quentin Tarantino fan you'll love this movie, as it's got all the quirks and wacky people you'd expect, with the added bonus being that each character has his/her own style and distinct personality (one of my problems with with QT is everyone seems to talk the same way).It's such a clever ploy making the writer also the central character. I don't think it's been done before. He's often the foil for the other actors who are constantly jabbing him about his lack of initiative and, especially his drinking. I also love the way this movie critiques itself on the fly.

237,glen2010,"Interesting, charming and full of character",8,3 September 2013,"Seven Psychopaths is one of those films you may wish to watch more than once to truly appreciate the wit and intelligence of the plot. Before viewing the film I had expected an average tongue-in-cheek crime-thriller, so I was pleasantly surprised by its unique personality which, by today's standards, could be said to be rather original. McDonagh's writing certainly must be given credit, he seamlessly creates characters who, initially, seem like your typical crime-flick heroes and villains and then moulds them into new, fresh personalities.The film is extremely self-aware, using the script that the main character, Marty, is writing to almost criticise and laugh at the film's own plot (which cleverly intertwines with Marty's own script). Some may be put off by the fact that some scenes are simply portrayals of Marty's script and therefore 'not real' but McDonagh connects the two plots in a style that, for me, was nothing but entertaining and enjoyable. The humour is smart and not over-used, so much so that I found it to be funnier than some films that focus solely on comedy itself. The cast, of course, did an amazing job, bringing life to the characters and giving solid performances throughout. They were energetic and interesting and even, at times, relatable. Overall, I recommend Seven Psychopaths to anyone that can appreciate an intelligent film and would like something a little different to what they may normally be accustomed to.

Should have done a review for that one I should imagine. So, back to 7. Yeah I really liked it. Ultra violent, and with lengthy Raising Arizona pauses. Irreverent, as it ought to be with Samuel J.

Written and directed by Martin McDonagh (In Bruges), this movie is a one-two knock out with entertainment around every corner. The movie stars Colin Farrell, Sam Rockwell, Christopher Walken, and Woody Harrelson. Colin Farrell plays a writer struggling with a screen play called ""Seven Psychopaths."" His friend (Rockwell) is desperate to help write the screenplay. In the midst of all of this however, Rockwell also has a business on the side with Christopher Walken where they steal dogs, return them, and collect the reward money. Unfortunately, Rockwell and Walken make the mistake of stealing Woody Harrelson's dog; a psychopath who will stop at nothing to get his Shiatsu back.This script for this film is one of the most original I've ever seen. There are a lot of twists in this movie plot-wise and genre-wise making it a fantastic, unpredictable adventure. Many would think that a movie that jumps around through different genres would be a bad thing, but this movie is so fluid and every plot point connects so well, that you aren't bothered in the slightest about deciding what the genre is of this film. A film with the title Seven Psychopaths promises intense violence and you will get that, but not just that. This is not a mindless movie that uses just blood as entertainment. This is a smart movie that has plot and meaning. Yes, it's violent but there is also drama and a surprising amount of comedy. This is without a doubt, the funniest movie I have seen this year. The dialog in this film is perfect. All of the characters have a certain wit to them, delivering lines that are beyond hilarious.The acting is superb. Christopher Walken is the best he's been in years. This could very well be one of my favorite performances from him. I liked Woody Harrelson in this movie more than I liked him in Zombie Land. I applaud Sam Rockwell for being in this movie. He is just so funny in this role and plays it perfectly. There couldn't have been a better cast for this film. Everyone was flawless.If you enjoy creative writing, talented acting, and movies that are all-around completely original, then I encourage you to see this movie.

The humor and satire, although very clever and funny at times, overall fell flat. There were a few lines that when you caught them made you laugh out loud.. but not enough of them and not not written in a cohesive enough style to work.The high point was Sam Rockwell's performance which was powerful, convincing and funny, but otherwise it kinda sucked.",Seven Psychopaths
243,Ari97,A beautiful black comedy!,8,19 August 2013,"Well, I don't normally watch black comedies, so this one caught me by surprise. I admit that in the beginning I rented the film for Colin Farrell, who is an actor I really enjoy watching, and I was really eager to see what he would do with his character.The movie itself did not disappoint me at all. Firstly, the story was smart and original. I am of the opinion that this is what many films are lacking, so I was delighted to see Seven Psychopaths. Humour was intelligent and special.The constant murders and blood all over the place was something that makes the movie not alright to watch with kids, but also a surprising aspect that will get you at the edge of your seat.Another reason why the film was a pleasure is the cast. The lead actors did the best they could with their characters, and brought the -already good- script to a whole awesome level.I give a well- deserved 8 out of 10 and suggest that everyone watches it. It will make you love black comedy!",Seven Psychopaths

I am sitting here in shock, expecting much but never being close to imagining it would be this great. McDonagh has truly outdone himself. However spectacular In Bruges was, this is better. It is, in my opinion, truly one of the best gangster movies ever made - on par with e.g. Pulp Fiction. Moreover, the extremely cleverly written script often had me gasping for air because it was so g.d. funny. The cast is furthermore amazing. Christopher Walken is as brilliant as ever and Sam Rockwell possibly delivers the performance of his career.Watch it!BTW, How does it not have a higher rating than 7.5???",Seven Psychopaths

But, as much as I should dislike it, I can't help but absolutely love it.

247,nathanialwest,An intricate film with genuine laughs centered around a solid script,10,15 October 2012,"When I was driving to the theater, I was doubting my choice in Seven Psychopaths, because the trailer made it seem like so many films I'd seen before that looked edgy and wry, and showed so much promise in the previews yet fell short because of flat characters and muddled plots. This one, however, did not let me down.I suggest that you see this film purely because it tries to do more with a movie than anything you've seen in a while, and it manages to actually succeeds on all levels, while dangerously romancing the clichés of toying with clichés, movies about writing movies, and gangsters with a soft side. Every time the story started to get even a little generic, wild cards came firing in from all sides.The actors played their parts well, but Rockwell gave the best performance. I was impressed by Woody and Walken's abilities to shed their skins and get deeper into character than I've seen them be in years. This is a writer's film--the subplots (really, borderline vignettes) about the various psychopaths that Marty encounters are well done, their back stories unfold at different paces, and their details that connect them to the central plot are creatively deployed, while the momentum of the film clearly hinges in the here and now and does not make the mistake of merely chaining together several subplots to produce one ""dog"" of a story.I enjoyed almost everything about Seven Psychopaths. 10/10 to offset the 2 that someone without a brain will rate this.",Seven Psychopaths

250,robearbarrett,"Hilarious in Places, Worth a Watch",7,9 December 2012,"Much excitement was due when Seven Psychopaths was released, I was a big fan of In Bruges, which was McDonagh' previous big screen creation and was hoping for similar quality.There is plenty to admire from 7 Psychopaths, in particular the character creation and the quality of acting performances. The cast is a main reason to watch the film everyone brings something unique to the table. Sam Rockwell delivers some of the best comedy moments in the film and lifts the atmosphere when on screen. 7 Psychopaths shares similarities with In Bruges, in terms of Character exploration and humour with Colin Farrell's characters seeming almost identical.It's hard to explain the film without giving too much away, there are plenty of twists, Tarantino-esque violence and wit all combined in a far-fetched storyline. Despite in general being a good film, it does take a while to get going and the real humour doesn't arrive until later on.Overall 7 Psychopaths provides some really funny moments with a bizarre but certainly unique storyline........oh and a shi-tzu.",Seven Psychopaths
251,mackminute,Crazy About Shih Tzus,8,13 January 2013,"Seven Psychopaths is a dark and violent ""comedy"" that is very reminiscent of classic Coen Brothers movies. While writer/director Martin McDonagh doesn't quite reach their level of deftness and whit in his script, he has created several entertaining psychopaths for his actors to inhabit. Woody Harrelson channels just enough Mickey Knox into his portrayal of his unstable Shih Tzu loving mobster to make him my favorite loon in this flock. Colin Farrell adeptly plays the straight man role of the dysfunctional drunk writer around which this story rages. Playing the common man acting as the lens through which the audience can relate is one of the roles that Farrell has the most success in playing. It's when he is called on to carry too much dramatic weight that wheels tend to fall off his performances. Christopher Walken doesn't phone it in and brings a dollop of his low key genius to the screen. The absurdity of the characters goes hand in hand with the appropriately disjointed plot. You can't expect a story about the misadventures of a couple crazy dog kidnappers, a drunken screen writer and his semi-fictional psychopaths to walk a straight line can you? While the soundtrack and cinematography are nothing to write home about they don't detract from the film. Those yearning for a return of a Fargo / Barton Fink era Coen Brothers sensibility wrapped in enough violence and gun play to keep even a psychopath happy, with a side of Shih Tzu, look no further you've found your fix. and this has been The Mack Minute.

252,imho-612-934154,Disappointment,4,19 February 2013,"With Colin Farrell, Woody Harrelson and Christopher Walken in leading roles, and with a story about seven psychopaths, I had high expectations of this movie. I am a big fan of Quentin Tarantino and some of the reviews talks about that if you like Quentins movies you will like this one. That is not the fact. There is gore, surprises, shootings, some cool characters and as usual Christoper Walken is superb. These are some good things about the movie but then you can sense that director and writer Martin McDonagh wanted to do a twisted, smart movie with a cool dialog but, in my opinion, missed the goal by far. Though the intrigue is kind of smart it falls flat like a pancake. There is something missing all the way that makes it boring and uninteresting. For me it's a movie for ""direct to DVD"" that soon will be forgotten.",Seven Psychopaths
253,edm-the_red,Good Movie,9,30 October 2013,"Wow. This movie was surprisingly good. I was intrigued by the theatrical trailers, which had marketed it as a crazy comedy caper about a bunch of dog-kidnappers and their hilarious misadventures. The movie itself, however, cannot be summed up so simply or easily. The cast is excellent. Even the minor/cameo roles are done skillfully and are integral to the way the story plays out. The character development is awesome, as the story really is about seven ""psychopaths."" Each is certainly ""crazy"", but retains redeeming qualities. As the story unfolds, you begin to understand the characters reasons for their behavior(s), even if you don't understand them. In particular, my favorites were Sam Rockwell & Christopher Walken, but no one's performance is lacking in any way. Also, Woody Harrelson does a great job as what is arguably the film's villain. The plot develops in a manner that will shock you with the unexpected, and humor is constantly present to lighten the tone. The ending is very satisfying & almost alarmingly deep. Overall, very interesting and entertaining, & make sure to catch the final epilogue twist after the first round of credits.",Seven Psychopaths
254,virtuallyBRAINdead,Martin's Punch: Witty one-liners and awesome acting,7,5 February 2013,"While Martin McDonagh shocked us all with his directorial debut In Bruges, he takes us a few steps further with a dark comedy: Seven Psychopaths. The movie has several story lines sewn together by death, fear and guilt and boasts of a number of well played characters. The storyline is clever and builds up subtly as characters get to know each other closely. The Hollywood dream and its effects on the people who end up being mere puppets of life is a part of the theme and its witty one- liners will make you go Ho-Ho-Ho. Friendships are tested and relationships are ruined, a drunkard and a dog live while dog-kidnappers and psychopaths die; it makes for a near-perfect dark comedy. Some of the scenes are very engaging and are eccentrically comical. Psychopaths in this movie are not your usual demons, they have emotions and in some way you can connect to them. The script and the characters are original and delightfully entertaining. Screenplay is well-paced and crisp which will engage you continuously. In Bruges was definitely a better crowd puller but this movie will end up being a cult and was probably made for the same.",Seven Psychopaths

There are several themes that ultimately have no bearing on the story, It felt like the screenwriter was unsuccessfully trying too much to write a crazy script, that is cool and young and fresh and full of riddles and funny ridiculous characters. But ultimately it is a boring movie where we do not care about the characters, or the story.

I set about this film with an open mind I wasn't about to try and take it seriously but what I was expecting was a decent dark comedy. What I got was a mildly amusing mess. Within 45 minutes id more or less lost interest in the plot and just found myself waiting for the next brief chuckle or the next scene of violence which were few and far between.

However as soon as i saw that this was a Film4 movie my expectations were raised. From the word go this movie delivers, the characters are well thought out, the dialogue is exceptional (on a par with Tarantino), and the narrative is close to perfect. Although Colin Farrell play an Irish alcoholic with isn't a real stretch for him i feel that he puts in a solid performance and has definitely gone up in my estimations. Christopher Walken is his usual awesome bad guy self (he could order a McDonald's and still be menacing)however the real star performance comes from Sam Rockwell who plays Billy.

And this is why.,1,14 November 2014,"Firstly, and I am far from being the first (nor the last, for that matter) to find that the plot was absolutely dismal. Not only does it feel like it was written by an ill-inspired 11 year old, it also does not hold together. Secondly, the cinematography is poor. No interesting POV shots, no different use of lighting or anything what so ever. From the lack of originality to the botched up scenes where objects disappear from one shot to the other, this movie is an insult to the art of cinematography by and large. Thirdly, the dialogues are perhaps the stupidest, most basic exchanges one could possible think of: ""Put your hands up!"" ""No"" Why not? I have a gun"". The substandard interchanges of the movie will leave you with a cringe.I was deeply disappointed by this movie, and only wished I had consulted IMDb before watching it.

At times the first watch feels one too much already.I saw In Bruges by the same director and I liked it. This one I didn't. So I wanted to write a review to say don't watch it. But then I changed my mind. Indeed, the movie reminds me of the joke with the man selling a horse at the market. A customer stops, looks at the horse, and a dialogue ensues: it looks so skinny... yes it's quite weak. and, it does not have teeth... no it doesn't... the twit!it also looks like it's not seeing well...yeah, it is blind; such an old piece of turd! then why bring it to the market? well, i just want to ridicule the bastard.For a comedy I found the movie a bit like the horse in the story. A bit skinny (the humor is diluted by a dramatic atmosphere, a meta-text which also yearns to be critique of Hollywood clichés into which the film falls nevertheless), without teeth (that would be the plot, or any kind of character development), and blind (the movie starts with a discussion about shooting people in the eye and goes downhill towards scenes worthy of horror movies).But ""comedy"" is in the eye of the beholder after all, so go and see it...",Seven Psychopaths

Isn't IT?!!!! the writing was NOT witty or intelligent, it was at sitcom level. quoting a line from near the end of the movie, ""...i don't think fags like to be called that anymore, i think they prefer homos...."" cue laugh track hahahahahaha. no... just no. funny how that line could have most likely been taken straight from the sitcom two broke girls.the action scenes were more of an after thought and just a necessity to fulfill the psycho premise and to once again drum the idea that THIS IS AN AMAZINGLY CLEVER CONCEPT.

Though Martin McDonagh does offer hints of Ritchie but he establishes his forte with a panache, a kick-ass one. But once it puts on its burners, oh its fun all the way... Its not a regular run-of-the-mill gangster movie with loads of blood and low on substance. It has mystery, mastery on characterization,wit, charm, and ""layers"". The movie starts slightly direction-less, but as it progresses and characters develop, especially Sam Rockwell's, oh the charm...oh the charisma...!!! Colin Ferrell, who seems to be a favorite of Mr. Martin, looks flawless in his role. His slightly blurred acting skills (the ones he used in In Bruges as well)looks ravishing in this role of an alcoholic writer who is looking for motivation. The deranged friendship between Colin and Sam also hooks your interest. However, it turns chilly as the movie progresses.The best part about this movie is its climax.

One thing I'll say is that it is amazingly acted. Everyone is great. The music is great as well. The problems with the movie are not with the movie itself per se' but with me. The movie is very surreal and strange. I am not one who digs the crazy shizzle that goes on in movie like this a lot. The scene's in which certain cut away events take place are odd but engaging. The movie is also very Tarantinoisc. The dialogue is tight and engaging. The ending is very spaghetti western as well. I feel the marketing team did not know how to market this movie though. It was marketed as a quirky comedy on TV. This is not what you'll get. The movie is very funny...at times, but it is a very select type of humor. It is a very dark comedy and gets very serious at times. But the ending is really the best part. All in all a pretty great movie and I got more than I expected.

The film was very satisfying to me personally, weaving an original story around rich characters. Story is something that I take into great consideration when viewing a film as it has lost a foothold in many films today. In terms of presentation, I felt this movie to be a combination of Guy Richie, Quentin Tarantino, and The Coen Brothers. It's hilarious, dark, gripping, precise, quirky, demented, gory, and British. The frequent narration and character introduction of the movie gives it a constantly evolving lure and makes you feel like you're sitting by a camp fire listening to something unfold. Even though their is a thick layer of narration and Peckinpah darkness, it's fun as hell, with the acting a huge aspect of that; if you want to experience a great story, that discovers a point to the whole mess these characters undertake, and have a blast at the same time, then go see this awesome movie!",Seven Psychopaths

There's a sequence with an ex- Vietnam soldier (I won't describe it further) and a man with a rabbit, both of which are top-notch.

281,LawyerTom,A Serious Attempt That Went To The Dogs,3,14 February 2013,"When one thinks of dark satire, one pictures The Hospital, Last Man Standing, or Se7en. Seven Psychopaths strives to enter this rarefied kingdom, leavened with a touch of humor. With an incredible cast like this, the movie should have hit it out of the park. But the characters are shallow and not even two dimensional. It may be best to think of the story line as the alcoholic delusions of Marty (Colin Farrell), a struggling writer trying to create a screenplay. But even his delusions are flat and unimaginative.The one obvious exception was Linda Bright Clay, who shines with depth and dimension. But she alone cannot save this failed silly farce. Were she only given more screen time. For a male stoner teenage audience the storyline might be funny, but otherwise it is a waste of time. To be fair, I must give the brief opening sequence an A+; brilliantly unexpected and hilarious. After that, Seven Psychopaths crashes and burns. Don't waste your time.",Seven Psychopaths

283,cbergman-newvirtue,lower your expectations first.,6,18 July 2013,"Most of my low rating is due to the directing which from one other review i skimmed it seems you need to be a fan of in order to like this. (personally i do not see why any movie should have such a high requirement in order to enjoy it but, whatever. i guess its my fault for not researching a movie before watching it.) I generally have low expectations of movies i know little about so it is hard for me to get disappointed. usually. This movie, however, does a really good job of building disappointment.What i mean by that is that this movie actually shows you a taste of what excitement is like, than it never comes back to it. it actually ""blueballs"" its own audience. For example, some of the back stories of the psychopaths are so intriguing that i have to wonder, ""Why didn't they just make a movie about the psychopaths?"" but instead they made a movie about the guy making a story about the psychopaths. this thing disappoints me in a lot of other aspects (like the false realities) but this to me is a huge flaw as it actually generates its own disappointment.I feel like i understand the route that the story tried to go. the semi-classic, ""writer gets written into the story""/""story comes to life"" plot/theme/whatever, and on paper the whole thing seems like it would make a good story. in fact this would probably make a great book if it isn't one already. In the end though, i just found watching the movie boring and, like i said before, disappointing. constantly waiting for it to get better but better never comes.As i said before, it looks good on paper, and i cannot really blame the actors for my sadness so i think its probably the director which from other reviewers i gather is an ""acquired taste."" I would not recommend this movie to anyone.",Seven Psychopaths

This is not a funny film. This is not even a film to be honest. This piece of bull should be watched only as an anthropological analysis of the artistic abyss that some good actors descend in oder to earn some extra dollars. I am so surprised that this thing was actually aired and not shelved, as it represents the ultimate disgrace for anyone involved. I really mean this review - This is really AWFUL!

In my opinion, it starts with one of the best opening scenes I have ever watched, following up with great actors and a well-written screenplay. Seven Psychopaths is what it says: Seven psychopaths, brought together to solve problems for almost two hours, leaving behind smiles, happiness and a gorgeous little Shih Tzu.Once again; Not the greatest movie of all time, but mark my words; 7.2 on IMDb.com is underrated, it is way much better.

If you're a fan of Tarantino or Guy Ritchie, as I am, this film would seem interesting. However, it falls short of any film from that genre.There was much potential with the plot and good quirky characters, but it seemed the writing and direction fell off the rails about half way through the film. Killing some of the likable characters in the film starts to take away from the funnier scenes in the movie. As the movie progressed, it just felt like the writers were running out of good material and were desperate for an ending. Too bad, it could have been a real gem if properly done.

A novelist (Farrell) constantly imagining through scenes starring the rest of the cast the words he's putting to paper. The film means to show humor through unnecessary violence, but unlike Quentin Tarantino, this director can't pull it off here - it's just rarely funny, but almost always bloody. It's not that the director can't write and shoot good films with violence, see his 2008 film In Bruges with Daniel Bruhl. In Seven Psychopaths, I was constantly asking (aside from the money) what were these fine actors doing in this mess of a film. At best, the only reason you'd want to watch this movie was if one of your favorite actors appears in it, and you'd like to watch everything they've done.",Seven Psychopaths

I like to watch movies again to get the whole pictures meaning and view etc. Seven Psychopath's is not that kind of a movie. The gore is just gross and the herd of rabbits makes for an intended ""bad dream"" movie. The woman who saws people's heads off and slashes people is just stupid and a hit woman added to the movie. The actors are good it's just the gore and bunnies and the shoot'em up gore sessions that make for a dumb movie. Didn't go with the plot of the movie. A Next Day return and a wasted week of waiting for the next movie to get here. Choose a better movie. This is not listed as blood and gore movie either. It Ruined the movie.",Seven Psychopaths

And cute dogs and bunnies are a nice touch but they too do not a make it good movie. Writer- director – co-produce Martin McDonagh must think he is the next Quentin Tarantino at black comedies. I will give him some credit for originality. He, however, writes at the TV sitcom level constantly insulting your intelligence. I thought it was too far off, even for a psychopath, when Billy kills his girlfriend for no reason. And whose idea was it to make Sam Rockwell look like Phil Keoghan, the excellent host of ""The Amazing Race""? At the premier last night in Westwood, some of the audience laughed, but we couldn't wait until it was over. It may not be quite the worst movie of the year but it was not worth the free price of admission.",Seven Psychopaths
290,lhhanson-55536,Hilarious in the best way,9,9 August 2021,"This is the best kind of comedy, used in a very effective way. I would 100% suggest this film to anyone with a good sense of humor.So many movies get the whole ""dark-comedy"" idea wrong. They too often lean on shock factor to potentiate their finger-lift of a joke, but this movie uses its cynical and abrasive style with purpose. Character and plot development is masterfully intertwined with joke-telling, plus, it's actually funny. Wonderful storytelling with a twist I didn't see coming and genuinely impactful moments.The acting in this movie is fantastic! Sam Rockwell in particular stood out to me. I've never seen him in anything before and I was very pleasantly surprised. His character is absolutely hysterical and he feels so real, as does every character in this film.One thing I will say is lacking a bit is it's bizarre logic. While it's a worthy sacrifice to support the style of the movie, it wouldn't be honest to say it doesn't detract a bit. But I don't know, I'm a bit slow... maybe some things just went over my head. But yea overall, this movie rocks.",Seven Psychopaths

292,zeyadsalem,what seemed to be a great scenario,5,21 January 2013,"This movie started great; surprisingly violent with moments of hilarious accidents and coincidences. From the beginning, you can see that you're watching what seemed like a clever witty scenario with a well- written characters and decent performances from Collin Farrel and Sam Rockwell, which gave a great supporting role as the wacky Billy Bickle, and deserved a recognition. But the movie went through periods of boring meaningless dialogues and events (almost half of the movie dedicated to the pursuit of a helpless dog belonged to a crime boss who appeared ruthless but when his dog's taken, he's transformed into a babbling crying boy), and when we reach the end, we lose touch with the story and wonders, ""what is going on? what happened to the promising plot and outset?"". When you reach the end, you may tell yourself that the director intended the movie to come out like this, but did he or he just let things flow as they are?? i can't tell for sure but Director Martin McDonagh tried to add his own different vision of psychopaths which is the main theme of the movie (it was stated by one of the movie characters that he doesn't want to see the regular Hollywood scumbag murderous psychopaths, instead, he wants a psychopathic movie about love and peace!!) and thus the characters came out comical pale version of the ""psychopaths"" who lacked the solid motive behind their actions through the entire movie which made the output void and pointless.",Seven Psychopaths
293,badpritt,flat pulp fiction rip-off,3,18 December 2012,"Want to make a ""cult"" film? Here's how. Just stir together the following five flat ingredients.1. Show a s*load of explicit violence. Use as much blood as possible. Result: Audience will be thrilled by their own primal prurience for cut throats and heads blasted off. 2. Drag the display of cheap violence into absurdity by adding a quirky-lovely character trait to each killer. If you run out of such traits, a funny hat will do. Add the usual really funny dialogue (well, one or two lines actually are in fact) with incorrect language and jokes about women, homosexuals, Blacks, Asians. Result: Audience can find a way to deal with the self-embarrassment about their own prurience and feel good: Hey, it's not real, it's just a funny black comedy!3. Pour in the odd shot (attention! there is a pun!) of a character looking into the sunset, and let them have an oh so thought-provoking, oh so meaningful moment of reflection on guns, racism, homophobia, feminism and all that stuff. Result: Audience can justify their own prurience: Hey, all that throat cutting is actually a meaningful metaphor on life itself! Deep!4. Plotwise, use a ton of flash backs, insert random subplots, films within the film... no matter, the only thing you'll want to make sure is the actual plot is interrupted as much as possible. Result: Audience will finally understand how sophisticated, multi-layered that film is, and you are. That's independent, that's art-house baby!5. A special flavour you will get by scattering citations of pop culture-defining films all over the place. Film geeks, this is for you!And wham! Ready is your clap-trapping pop art crap stew. Come on.To be fair, the actors who have to play in this rubbish are quite good, (Harrelson a bit too much over the top for my taste, but Walken giving a very fine, laid-back performance). And you can't deny that those ingredients are stirred together quite expertly. Which makes it even worse: Does a director with that skillset and imagination really need to fish for compliments in such a cheesy way?",Seven Psychopaths
294,scotsmist1,Seven Psychopaths,3,3 February 2013,"From the opening Scene it tried and failed to play out as a classical Tarantino sketch, I mean come on even the girl jogger managed to surprise and scare the crap out of them these professional killers where unqualified to kill time.Billy (Sam Rockwell) plays a small time crook who makes a living by dog- napping with another ageing petty crook (Christopher Walken)where they would wait for reward notices to go up so that they could eventually sell the dogs back for the reward money. Marty (Colin Farrell) plays a talentless alcoholic screenwriter, (perhaps if truth be known the film would have been a damn sight better if he had.) Story starts (I mean fails to start) when Billy steals 'Mad Charlie's mutt and instead of returning it to him decides to keep it for himself..... A film about men, guns & little dogs should have at least given me a clue into what I was about to step into, this film was a waste of good actors who may I add did an OK job with the arse-wipe of a script, a script which had more holes in it than a 'Tetley Tebag'. This will go down bad for Farrell who by now should be putting together some fine acting yet instead has fallen into the 'Hugh Grant Syndrome' by making a couple of so-so's and then melting into a comfortable stereotype of nothingness. Woody & Rockwell are both great actors with a long list of crowd pleaser's between them so this will end up being real turkeys for them, I mean with their professionalism one would have thought that they would have smelt a turd of this magnitude way off and have avoided it like an Oprah Winfrey interview. Anyway Pandora box has now been kicked well and truly open and so we have another pox to contend with but don't take it from me if you have 110 minutes of your life that you want to throw away then go ahead otherwise spend it with your spouse, your kids, family even your bloody Shih Tzu!Don't say I didn't warn you.",Seven Psychopaths
295,bennyboy_360,A bit too twisted for me..,6,10 December 2012,"Gore, gore, gore.I usually like my fair share of gore in a movie, however in this movie I found it was too much. I've watched Reservoir Dogs and In Bruges and have thoroughly enjoyed these movies. Seven Psychopaths was funny in places however, I found myself feeling awkward; whether I was meant to laugh or not in certain moments during the film.Despite its negatives, the movie had a superb cast, fine acting and dialogue throughout. In particular, Sam Rockwell displays a fine ""psychopathic"" performance, which is both hilarious and shocking in places.As most of characters portrayed were psychopaths, maybe the fact that I found the film was too much proved that I was not a psychopath, which I suppose is a good thing.Overall, my initial reaction was that it was too torturous and blood orientated when perhaps it didn't need to be. But potentially on a second viewing my opinion might change and upon this my rating and review will change.Rating: 6/10",Seven Psychopaths
296,MovieFan62855,Coulda Been Better,5,23 February 2013,"Seven Psychopaths was mildly amusing and the acting was good. However, it wasn't the home run I was hoping for given the strong cast. The script was where it fell short for me....not many big laughs, not too much excitement and no wow or ah-ha moments. Most of the characters were unique and interesting and that's the strength of Seven Psychopaths. Woody Harrelson once again delivers another great performance and continues to prove what a great actor he is. Christopher Walken is probably the most amusing character as Hans, and Sam Rockwell is excellent. Colin Farrell is also good as a writer who's decided to write a movie script entitled Seven Psychopaths, but other than that really doesn't have much of an idea as to what it will be about or who the seven psychopaths are. I'm not likely to see Seven Psychopaths again but I'm glad I saw it...I would say its worth the two hours, but not good enough to spend much on a rental.",Seven Psychopaths

BRILLIANT!!!There are several films that are all about the movie-making process, but this is a ""Dense"" genre to make work. Seven Psychopaths has success in ironing out the art of each individual character and the dexterity of plot coherency, it doesn't cross that lonely road of becoming too indulgent in the process and too concerned with ""favored"" quirks that lead the audience to self-harm.

Lots of CGI effects , lots of running, lots of destroying etc. This movie is pure, it is like, old school movie, when story was important and not effects. What is most interesting is that all characters in this movie are equally presented, it is like there are no main character.Colin Farrell so far I could not see in a comedy, I was pleasantly surprised. Woody and Christopher were, as always up to the task. Sam Rockwell is hilarious. Every move that Mr. Rockwell made ​​in the film brought me to tears. I think that Mr. Rockwell should decide to act only in comedies. I will say only this, why this screenplay was not offered to Mr. Quentin Tarantino.

I for one, quite liked the movie. It challenged the horrid clichés that I hate to see in movies, E.g the epic shootout, and supplemented these scenes with quirky and hilarious dialogue. The acting is on point, but then again there was no question that it wouldn't be. I mean, look at that cast list. Examples of clichés used with a humorous twist: the gangster with a softer side, the struggling writer and the vigilante with loose morals or the anti hero.

It is a film without wit, heart, soul .. just a total mess, from the incoherent plot to the wasted, poorly directed cast. The ""10 out of 10"" reviews on this site convince me that studio paid movie reviewers are at work to salvage the reputation of this disastrous effort to reproduce the energy and spice of Pulp Fiction etc. Seven Psychopaths is a total dog that contaminates everyone involved - from audience, to actors, to the projectionist - the latter ill-fated to see this thing more than once.

There is shooting and some action stuff involved, but that isn't where the main kick of the film is, it's the character development and their honest sense of humour which makes In Bruges a great watch. Seven Psychopaths has, more or less, done the same thing. Of course Martin McDonagh has written and directed both of these films. Even though Seven Psychopaths has the same formulae as In Bruges, it is a very different film. It's more graphic, where I suppose more budget means you can have more heads shot to pieces. The message itself from this film seems so clear to me, every character in Seven Psychopaths is likable, when watching the film you really do relate to these different characters and you kind of want both of the oppositions to succeed.It is thoughtful, the dialogue is fantastic and Sam Rockwell was by far my favourite performance of the film, even though Colin Farrell, Woody Harrelson and Christopher Walken were also obviously great performances.

I'm continually impressed with what is being created (acting wise), but remain disappointed when it comes to the associated screenplays/plot lines. At the end of this film, I had the same, perpetual feeling that no one out there making ensemble films gets the message: without a good story, you don't have a really good film. Seven Psychopaths hearkens me back to the director last movie I would have thought he, at least, would appreciate the need for a good story to match the tone of the film.

The 7 people listed in the film aren't even the psychopaths... who ever cut and produced the trailer obviously just wanted the simplest trailer going for the widest of audiences.Now... *MILD SPOILERS* Two of the 7 psychos aren't very useful to the plot and they also lead to the most graphic levels of violence in the movie, we're talking, Ichy and Scratchy from the Simpsons acted out with real people basically. It was OK but lets say my girlfriend was very unhappy at this point (I'm surprised she didn't walk) and even I couldn't look at these points. I assumed the couple would be apart of the plot later on and they weren't so it kind of annoyed me that I had to go through that for no pay off at all, just an intro of two characters and a good 10 minutes wasted. It also became quite clear after that the film was fine until they would cut to a 'dream' sequence part where it was going to be in some way bloody. I'm still quite surprised at how this passed as a 15 considering just how full on the gore was.The funny thing is, despite the dark scenes, my girlfriend laughed pretty good and quite frequently a long the way, I don't think she'll ever watch it again but it's still a testament to the quality of the humor it has to offer.In the end it makes me wonder if the violence had been more suggested than graphic we'd have a film that left us talking more about how great the characters are compared to just how disturbing some of the images were. Still if you like sharp humor and don't get too bothered about seeing people dismembered in multiple ways I think you'll have a hard time not having a positive outlook over this movie.",Seven Psychopaths

It is more dramatic and you do feel for some of the characters. The movie does have some faults like some predictable plot points and the humor fails at some parts, but this shouldn't discourage you from watching the film. It is worth the price of the ticket.

With that being said, this movie is GREAT. I would say a must see for anyone who likes a good laugh. Funny scenes and lines are patched in throughout. I found myself laughing very often (I am not an easy laugher). I didn't know what to expect going into this film. I had heard it's similar to In Bruges, but I have never had a chance to see that. Just the opening scene is hilarious. Collin Farrell plays his role beautifully. He plays a seemingly washed up writer trying to figure out his next screenplay. His friend Billy starts feeding him ideas. His friend and another wonderfully talented actor Christopher Waken (who also does a impeccable job in this movie) run a dog-kidnapping business.

Farrell's eyebrows and frowns are a sight behold but it is Walken, with an understated but thoughtful performance that steals the show, even in his twilight years.Photography is par for the course and nothing too special.

I will say that within the first 3 minutes of seeing brains blown out, my initial reaction was to just get up and go home to catch up on a few of my DVR shows, but I did not drive and my movie partner was quite intrigued. It was annoying because though there are several folks in the movie ads that you assume are going to be integral parts of the movie end up with their brains blown out before you can stand it. I suppose that they wanted to go for the star appeal of dropping names, but if you are a fan of the majority of the characters, you will never get a chance to see them unless seeing them splat on the screen is your idea of fun.My most pressing question that nearly made me refuse to leave the theater is...

I won't spoil it here, but the casting and story are fantastic. Everything about this movie is fantastic. If you're a fan of Tarantino or movies with great dialogue and humor you should check this movie out. Definitely in my top 5 favorite movies of all time, and I've seen A lot of movies.

However, what most of them won't tell you is that this movie is actually better than that. Seven Psychopaths is like a Tarantino movie on Steroids. To call this movie witty is to not give it enough credit. Wit only goes so far. This movie is down right brilliant. Everything said or done has a reason to it, and when it all comes together at the end you'll be left completely satisfied. Watching Seven Psychopaths is like seeing an abstract painting slowly evolve into a chaotic mess of pure beauty. If you were thinking to yourself, ""Gee I wish there were a movie without any meaningless moral clichés that still conveys a relevant message"" then I'd ask you if have a fairy god parent because this is that movie. I give you a 99% guarantee that you will not be disappointed with Seven Psychopaths. I've tried to think of some type of person that wouldn't like this movie, and I just can't think of any.

But boy was I ever disappointed. I don't know why some people compare this to Pulp Fiction. This is not even close. Pulp Fiction's plot made sense, had interesting characters, and was easy to follow. But Seven Psychopaths' plot was very confusing, meaningless, and pointless. I couldn't make sense of the plot, what was real and what was not. And I couldn't care less about the characters.

SEVEN PSYCHOPATHS accomplished both, and I simply had a good time viewing it. Some of the best actors in the business are involved and their performances are perfect for their characters. McDonagh's writing and directing is superb, the cinematography is wonderful, and if you're ""of age"" you'll catch all the subtle references inserted throughout much of the movie.I always refer to this kind of picture as 'comedy with a sense of humor', because they're usually high quality and don't insult your own intelligence (as so many movies do, unfortunately). Think ""Fargo"", or ""Pulp Fiction"", or ""From Dusk Till Dawn"", etc., and you'll know what I mean. The language and violence is pervasive, but it's obviously necessary for the story and the type of characters and plot involved...not gratuitous. If you can get past that, you can't help but love and enjoy this one. Not for young people regardless, but it's an excellent, dark comedy that's recommended for any adult that appreciates this type of intelligent film-making...and worth seeing any way you can view it!",Seven Psychopaths

Characters appearing initially in vision burst into the primary narrative, at-times by subsuming character identity (à la possession or, given the religious overtones, Transfiguration). All of this takes place intra-psychically - the film is the dream of the Writer-Director (with one exception - the Shih-Tzu Bonny, who plays herself, even as our protagonist shares the Director's name).The creative process is explored and, while mapped onto Tarrantino-esque bloody business, the humor element is yet not allowed to metastasize into the absurd (unlike ""Pulp Fiction""), the narrative pulls back from the nihilistic edge and, at the denouements (which number at least three), actually Says Something. The most memorable moments elicit tears.Credit sequence with tampered film stock is a now-familiar signaling of fourth wall breaking: Some ""psychopaths"" may in fact be capable of deploying empathy, love and even mercy.",Seven Psychopaths

Martin McDonagh, is a good work on the verge of dark-comedy and life drama, with a hell of a cast.The storyline is pretty simple and straight, no unexpected twists or trying to play mindgames. Plot is about people and that fact, that we are all at some point psycopaths. They are not hiding under masks and they are not ""living myths"". Every psychopath in this movie, is just a person with a mental problems or even mental traumas, which can't be defeated or controled. The only person, who is really changes and has his own arc is the main character, the screenwriter. He is trying to sort out the problems of other psychopaths that led them to this. But after the dramatic finale of the story of his friends, he comes to the fact that he himself becomes a kind of psychopath. He is no longer afraid of death, since he has seen and heard something worse.Talking about a main character. Cast and acting is one of the best sides of this movie. With this film,
Colin Farrell aproved that he still have some skills, and with a good screenplay, he can do the show. And obviously, speaking from nowadays, I can say, that this film started Sam Rockwell's Hollywood career, because all the comedy here is depends on him and his incredibly moving play.To sum up, this is one of the best comedies i ever saw.

There are some good laughs along the way, but these are very inconsistent. The main character of this film is a screenplay writer and as the story progresses it becomes meta-fictional, this aspect of the film is very weak and superficial and attempts to add depth to the film. This is absolutely unnecessary and slightly weakens the plot as it begins to become borderline pretentious towards the end. The acting is slightly frustrating at times especially Colin's. Colin tries to bring out the same style of acting as he did in In Bruges but it is madly inappropriate given the context of the film. The films is definitely not for kids or the squeamish as there is a decent amount of violence that, despite often being used for comedic effect, is mildly unsettling. The only really standout feature of this film is Sam Rockwell. His character is consistently funny and saves this film from being a complete borefest. Nevertheless, Seven Psychopaths is an enjoyable and funny film that, despite its attempts at being more than a crime-comedy, is nothing more than a simple crime-comedy. If you plan on watching this film do not watch In Bruges first, it will make this film a very mediocre experience at best.",Seven Psychopaths

Having not enjoyed ""In Bruges"" in the least, I was not expecting much from this title. I was however quite surprised to find myself enjoying this movie. Now to be completely fair I can see a lot of high brow critical types who like either artsy, touching, hippie flicks, or straight up action, no thinking required flicks, to hate this movie. And in their defense the trailer does not portray the movie for what it is. It is gross, violent, and a little chatty. I would compare it to the original clerks, with more violence. It is carried by the dialog with blood and guts thrown in just for funsies. I think it was well acted if not a little over directed. However my goal going into a movie is to be entertained. For 90+- minutes I want to escape reality and real life problems and just have fun. I usually check my morals at the door. So if you want a good ride then you should check this film out, however if you actually listen to critics and agree with them , or if you refuse to see a movie that will not earn a Oscar nod then please save us all from your over critical highbrow review and stay your ass at home.

And if you can't find it in you to wade through so much literature in order to understand what the subject at hand will be once you enter the theater, then you can safely assume that this film isn't for you. Finally, if you make the choice to watch this movie after more-than-fair warning given by the title, please don't annoy the rest of us with your silly reviews in which you discuss how shocked you are at the violence and how perplexed you are over the strange characters. ""Seven Psychopaths."" Not one, or three or four, but seven. I'm assuming you know the definition of the word seven, so here's a short definition of the second word, psychopath: ""a person affected with antisocial personality disorder."" That doesn't tell you much, does it? Maybe this excerpt from ""Scientific American"" magazine will help:""Superficially charming, psychopaths tend to make a good first impression on others and often strike observers as remarkably normal. Yet they are self-centered, dishonest and undependable, and at times they engage in irresponsible behavior for no apparent reason other than the sheer fun of it. Largely devoid of guilt, empathy and love, they have casual and callous interpersonal and romantic relationships. Psychopaths routinely offer excuses for their reckless and often outrageous actions, placing blame on others instead. They rarely learn from their mistakes or benefit from negative feedback, and they have difficulty inhibiting their impulses.""This should help those of you who took a wrong turn on your way to relax and laugh your way through ""Wreck It Ralph,"" as well as those of you who were looking forward to sitting through and even enjoying the formulated romantic schlock that invokes a gag reflex in those of us who don't believe ""Cinderella"" was a documentary. ""Seven Psychopaths"" is a movie about a frightening subject: psychopathy. It's well-written, superbly acted, engaging, provocative, and above all else, funny. Is it perfect? Nope. Lots of loose ends. Maybe one or two psychopaths too many to follow for the duration, but I guess ""Seven Psychopaths"" sounds better than ""Six."" Plot-wise, the movie in places is as loosely stitched as most (all?) of the Coen brother's films, although nowhere near as annoyingly scattered. And if you actually liked ""Barton Fink,"" as one of ""Seven Psychopaths"" reviewers proudly claimed, then you might not be ready for something so much more cerebrally challenging. True, this ain't the product of Tom Stoppard or even Aaron Sorkin. But it is a movie that invites you to examine our absurd fantasies about any perceived noble link between violence and justice. It's an exercise in the reality of ambiguity, the kind of movie that would make Clint Eastwood turn over in his grave – if he was all the way dead. Here's one more clue as to whether or not you would enjoy ""Seven Psychopaths."" Do the previews of most movies shown in theaters these days make you squirm with embarrassment? Yeah, me too.

I certainly did not laugh once during this film and in fact I sat with my eyes shut for some of the time because I became sickened from all the very frequent and dreadful scenes of blood and carnage. This film involved lots of people being shot or worse and lying dead in pools of blood. There was blood all over the murderers, floors and walls. Dead bodies lying in pools of blood. People dying in extreme agony. Even had a poor child who had been attacked, tortured and murdered and was covered in blood. I would call this film an out and out horror film.

The film is a random collection of shock value gross out violence strung together by a flimsy writer struggling to write thread of a plot. Each violent episode is aimed to eclipse the last in grossness and volume of blood and splatter. I'm not usually turned away by violence if it moves a plot. (I'm a huge Breaking Bad fan.) Here though, they are pointless (they're psychopaths, get it? The violence doesn't have to make sense then.) This is a pathetic effort of story telling that actually had a chance to be clever, but the writing is lame, the plot ""devices"" strained and the violence overwhelming. They seem to want to catch that 14 to 17 year old male gross out fan. I can only hope the film dies as quickly as the first two characters.

The problem for me was the actual story line, it had no fluidity to it and kept going of in different directions, one second they would be running from a gangster and the next talking about a Vietnamese priest trying to get vengeance. It didn't make any sense what so ever; some one on here said it was very Tarantino/Esq but I disagree as Tarantino would never put his name to this crappy production! As for calling it a comedy that is a true understatement, I laughed once and that was at the guy sat in from of me for spilling his drink! The whole crowd at the cinema sat in silence through out!Overall Marks Acting a solid 8 as they were excellent actors!Story-line a 1 and only because I'm feeling generous!Comedy value again a 1 as its nearly Christmas and it would be mean to give a 0!Well that's the end of my review and I hope it saves someone the 2 hours of your life you will never get back sat in the cinema watching this, at a push watch it on DVD but definitely don't waste money on this film!",Seven Psychopaths
345,tompr-585-465401,Shambolic and not funny. Just don't watch it.,1,21 January 2013,"Not often do I log in just to leave a bad review. Not often do I turn the movie off 10 minutes before it ends. Not often does a movie make me angry. I had no expectations whatsoever towards this movie, and watched it purely judging by the great cast and the good IMDb score what's happened to you IMDb by the way? You are usually spot on. The rating for this particular movie is way of the mark, though.Shambolic, trivial, daft, silly Those words come to mind when trying to think of the plot here. I love W. Harelson and C. Walken, but even such class actors could not rescue the movie from being one of the worst films in the cinematographic historyThe acting was wooden and the characters didn't convince me for a second. Especially Billy. Rockwell, regardless of his other semi-good performances, should be banned from acting. What a bad execution, what a poorly written character You are just an idiot in the movie. Not a psychipatic character... just a cretin. I could go on forever here, especially regarding the plot - confusing, stupid and boring. I was struggling to keep up with this mess, thinking, hoping, praying it would get better... No, it didn't. I turned this crap off 10 minutess before it ended and hoped to forget it asap for it really made me angry. I just can't believe something as bad is actually released, marketed and being sold to the public as a witty, black humour, gory comedy... Cretinism, mess, boredom and confusion. This is the legacy of the movie. I'm not new to this genre. I love Tarantino, Rodriguez etc this is however so bad it doesn't deserve any attention at all. DO NO WATCH!!!",Seven Psychopaths
346,alexstupak,Stupid waste of talent,2,5 August 2013,"It started out so well, the opening scene (no spoilers) and I thought it was going to go in an interesting direction. Nope. It became silly rather than funny, and a torturous waste of such talented actors. I didn't laugh at all, instead I gritted my teeth and hoped it would be over soon (I watched it at a friend's house and couldn't for politeness sake, leave before it was finished as birthday cake was coming out when it was over). I like all these actors, and I didn't mind In Bruges, but this was a thin extension on the ideas in that already thin vein. This movie just seemed like the producers had the financing in place before they had a script and they had enough money and connections to hire appealing actors. I wanted to like it, but it was just awful.",Seven Psychopaths
347,brittneydtarpley,Sad about the hours of my life I wasted,2,29 January 2013,"I had been super excited to see this movie since it was out in theaters. I am SO relieved that I did not actually pay movie theater price to see this piece of crap. It had the potential to be great considering the cast however, it is not. The best part of the movie is the cutaways to the cute dog! Very disappointed and regretful I spent $1.31 at Redbox. Don't waste your money. I generally love any film Chris Walken in in, but this is just a long, tedious, violent piece of junk. The main character is obnoxious and annoying, his friend Martin is a pushover wimp and Walken's character seems just kind of thrown in as an afterthought.",Seven Psychopaths
348,michilllie,I Felt Obligated to Register for IMDb Just to Review this Movie,1,8 February 2013,"It was truly awful. I figured with such a high score of 7.4 (I have enjoyed movies with much lower scores)and great actors, that I was in for a treat. It was more like a trick. This is in no way Tarantino-esque. Don't be fooled by the other reviewers who have said that it is. They lie. :)The first scene was by far the best. After that the story just gets convoluted and purposeless. I'm not giving any spoilers. I figure if you are really into self inflicted torture, you will want to see this. Otherwise, don't bother.On a positive note...the acting was great. Walken was wonderful as always. Sam Rockwell did a pretty good job. Woody Harrelson was a much better cast for this role than the original choice of Mickey Roarke would have been...but even with such great actors doing their job well, there was no saving this mess.",Seven Psychopaths
349,Lcain361,"Rude crude with horrific violence. Turned off, graphic and disturbing",1,9 February 2013,From the beginning The cursing started and didn't let up. The gruesome and graphic violence was over the top. I thought this was supposed to be funny but i didn't find anything funny at all.it was so stupid. A complete waste of time. If there was a lot less cursing and less graphic violence maybe it could have been a movie to watch if you want something completely without anything morally uplifting in any way. I don't see that this is a movie for a woman even if you can enjoy a movie with violence and offensive language. This was more than any one should watch. If this is what people are enjoying its no surprise that people are as sick and violent as they are in this world. We turned it off after about 20 minutes. Very upsetting!,Seven Psychopaths
350,matias-flaco,Just great,10,20 February 2013,"I am not going to say much... I just loved it... I don't think 10 is the right rate for this movie, but there are some bloody idiots without any idea about movies that give this really good movie rates below 4... so, I give it a ten just to make it even... yet, this deserves at least an 8... The work Sam Rockwell does in this movie is simply amazing... And guys, there is also Crispin Glover! The different psychopaths are also very nice... I mean, they all have their own features and you somehow relate to them and understand them, and maybe you can accept what they are doing because of their background... I laughed my ass out in some scenes... The monk story is just beautiful... Highly recommended...",Seven Psychopaths
351,jack-brophy-00,school movie review,9,2 April 2013,"To be perfectly honest if someone were to ask me what exactly seven psychopaths was about, saying seven psychopaths would be as far as I got before I was completely lost for words.There would have to be a reward for anyone who understood the entire film, pretty much all the characters have some sort of mental problem or issues and if they don't have that they're an extremely alcoholic Irish writer trying to write a psychopathic And lovey dovey movie.Not for the faint of heart seven psychopaths features plenty of violence, guns, murder and more violence with a side of mental obscurity. The brilliant cast execute a believable performance making a well-rounded although somewhat confusing at times violent comedy that will quench your blood lust.",Seven Psychopaths
352,jamessoggee,Brilliant!,10,27 March 2013,"In short to what everyone else has said,This film is cold realization of just how heartless situations can be.My sense of humor more often than not sickens my friends and this film put me in absolute stitches! it's things you shouldn't laugh at, however the concept of what is being talked about and the way the characters respond to them down to the pitch of voice, how casual it is, and even when nothing is said but expressions are seen, with some legendary quotes and brilliant scenes it also puts a flip on films previously made and does what it complains about on purpose.This film now belongs on my shelf up by other cult classics, I will not forget this movie, EVER.+ watch it a week later and you'll pick up on so much said early in the film.(this is my first ever review on IMDb, been here for ages but never felt so compelled to write a review.)",Seven Psychopaths
353,hollyfrost0,The seven psychopaths is a good film overall,7,15 April 2013,"The movie 'The seven psychopaths' was not a bad movie it was pretty good actually. I didn't understand much of the storyline. I liked Marty he was good at making up story's, i think Charlie loved his dog a little too much but it was pretty funny how they all wanted the same dog. I would watch this movie again. By just looking at the cover makes it look like an interesting film and it didn't let me down was a good movie. There are several films that exist about the movie-making process and it is a very difficult genre to make effectively. Seven Psychopaths succeeds in balancing the art of characters and the art of plot coherency, and it doesn't cross the line of becoming too involved in the process and too concerned with ""in"" jokes that leave the audience lost. To put it simply; the actors look like they're having fun, but they make sure we are still amused and connected with the film.",Seven Psychopaths
354,liam-thompson-00,good movie,7,15 April 2013,i personally really enjoyed seven psychopaths it took me a second time to actually understand it about how Marty was actually writing a movie and it all falls in to place right in front of him and he didn't really know it until the end at the final shootout the characters were really good billy Marty Hans and chuck played there parts really well and all the psychopaths were really good and made the movie rather interesting personally my favorite part of the movie was the final shootout it makes no sense but is still funny the movie is set in a great place ( Hollywood ) and gives the movie a great setting the desert at the end is a good setting as well for the final shootout overall seven psychopaths was a great movie,Seven Psychopaths
355,hellorickhill,Brilliant...for it's intended audience,10,3 June 2013,"This movie is not for everyone. In general, women or anybody of conventional PC sensitivities will not appreciate it...in fact they will hate it. It's for men who are iconoclastic, college educated and of independent thought. It scores poorly from the general population because it tramples all over conventional sensibilities. But it is easily the most playful, dark cult movie created in the last 10 years. Revelling in being sick, twisted and dark; it out ""Tarantinos"" Tarantino.It's heartening that a creative movie oriented to such a select audience can still be produced in this day and age of political correctness. In some respects, Ken Kesey, and the merry pranksters of the sixties still live! Best movie since ""Breaking Bad"" or the original ""Werewolves of London""...Warren Zevon would be proud!",Seven Psychopaths
356,danielpeskett-749-205584,violent and sadistic,1,27 July 2013,i would recommend this film to anyone of a sadistic or horrifying outlook on life a great cast is used disappointingly by the director to try and shock the audience with stupid disgusting images i would encourage anyone who enjoyed this film to seek medical and psychiatric help as this is a very disturbing and deranged film how you can try and turn massacre murder and torture into a comedy and then slap a 15 year old age range on the front is in my opinion disgusting an insane and would not even be slightly interested in meeting or even discussing with the director martin mcdonagh as if he believes this is acceptable viewing then we obviously would not get on well,Seven Psychopaths
357,gavbeinggreen,Complete waste of time,1,6 October 2013,"It's not very often that I use the term ""complete waste of time"" to describe a movie, but where other movies failed this movie succeeded in leaving me with nothing but a wish for my 90 minutes back. All the introspective plot needed was for the main character to wake up at the end, realizing it had all been a dream, for this plot to read completely like it was written by a high schooler.The fact that the movie is intentionally unbelievable just makes the violence annoying, not funny. Spoiler: watch for the guy with a bullet in his head at the end of the movie as he jokes to the dog. Just dumb.Then there was the happy, up-beat song at the end to remind you that the movie was supposed to have been a comedy. You know, in case you'd forgotten, which I had.",Seven Psychopaths

360,Nollie_West,A Hidden Comedic Gem,10,11 June 2017,"I've seen many movies in my day, but for some reason, this one has always stood out as my favorite. To me, this seems to be a very underrated film. Aside from it's crude and dark humor, the movie is much more intelligent than it's letting on. That makes it good for both the fart joke types of people, and the dry humor types of people. 7 Psychopaths also stands out to me because of it's terrific pacing of the plot. It does a great job of knowing the perfect points for a dark one liner, or a brain rattling plot twist. Finally, the casting of this movie was tremendous! Almost every actor in it is one of my personal favorites, and they all fit their characters perfectly. To put it simply, this film is a hidden comedic gem, and I would recommend it to just about anyone. 10/10",Seven Psychopaths
