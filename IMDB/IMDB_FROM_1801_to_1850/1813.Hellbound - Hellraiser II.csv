0,TheLittleSongbird,Hellish tearing of souls,7,25 October 2018,"Despite appreciating horror very much (with a lot of classic ones out there, such as 'Halloween', 'Nightmare on Elm Street', 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', 'Night of the Living Dead' and 'The Exorcist', plus the best of Hammer House of Horror), even if not my favourite genre, it took me a while to get round to watching the 'Hellraiser' franchise. Due to having so much to watch and review, and the list keeps getting longer and longer.The film that started the franchise off is not only for me by far the best of the 'Hellraiser' films it also for me, and quite a few others it seems, is one of the stronger horror films of the 80s, though not quite of all time. What is meant by being by far the best of the 'Hellraiser' films is that it is the only one to be above very good, the nine sequels were very variable (leaning towards the disappointing) and the latter films particularly are suggestive of the franchise having run its course.While the original 'Hellraiser' will always be the best of the series, its first sequel 'Hellbound: Hellraiser II' is one of its better sequels. Would go as far to say from personal opinion it's the best. Not as good as the original and understandably polarising, but it doesn't disgrace it. In some ways it is somewhat of a retread in terms of story except with more gore and less clarity of storytelling, though the imagination and ambition remains.'Hellbound: Hellraiser II' has its problems. The script is not as vivid and thought-provoking this time round, numerous times being cheesy and muddled. Will Hope is very bland in an underwritten role.Coming off worst for me was the ending, the Cenobites did deserve a much better defeat than the slapdash and silly one that is here while the staging of the ending itself is more like an incomprehensible parody complete with a terrible, unintentionally silly looking Channard.On the other hand, the production values mostly were fine. It's very atmospherically shot and the hellish imagery is disturbingly vivid. Apart from Channard, the effects are hardly schlocky and while prominent they are not overused or abused. The music score is an improvement here, more fitting with the atmosphere and very haunting music on its own. Tony Randel does more than competently when it comes to the direction, staying loyal to the spirit of the original. The script is patchy but still intrigues.Same goes for the story, regardless of whether sense is a strong suit or not (it isn't), which is most notable for Pinhead's very intriguing back-story and more of the Cenobites. Do prefer the mysteriousness they had in the original from being catalysts rather than being heavily focused on, but they are genuinely frightening, still look good and seeing more of and to them made them more interesting. While the ending disappoints, the twist is a clever one. Like the original, 'Hellbound: Hellraiser II' is genuinely disturbing while having tension, suspense and dread, the creativity of the set-pieces and deaths still remaining. The inmate skin flaying especially will be embedded in my mind forever. The gore is more in quantity and more graphic, but it didn't feel that pointless to me even if some parts serve more purpose to the story than others.Characters have personality and don't do anything that makes one infuriated by them, the detail to characterisation that was present in the original is here too. Cannot say anything bad about the performances, apart from Hope. Imogen Boorman brings nuance to a role not easy to pull off, while Clare Higgins and especially Kenneth Cranham are deliciously evil. Ashley Laurence is appealing and Doug Bradley shows why Pinhead is justifiably a horror icon.To conclude, worthy sequel. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
1,Leofwine_draca,Creative sequel,8,26 July 2016,"HELLBOUND: HELLRAISER II is the horror film that shows such nasty horrors that other late '80s horror films can only dare to hint at, and to boot it's a film made at Pinewood Studios. I have a feeling that this was the last horror film made in Britain (not counting amateur productions of course) to really offer up graphic, depraved horror, the stuff of nightmares, and we've never seen its like since. This is in some ways a superior sequel to the first film and I would rate the two almost equally as horror classics of the 1980s; it's merely that HELLRAISER came first with a delightful and raw simplicity that gives it the edge. HELLBOUND: HELLRAISER II takes the basic premise of the first film, only to expand upon it, explore the mythology created, and deliver an even bigger and better adventure.The gore and violence certainly hasn't been toned down, and in some ways it's even nastier than before. There are skinless people, hooks ripping flesh and, in a moment of pure evil, a man who hallucinates that his body is covered with grubs is given a straight-razor with which he proceeds to slash himself before a living corpse comes out of the mattress he is sitting on and devours him - if that isn't spine-chilling then I don't know what is. This is a very visual movie which is one of the few to offer up a depiction of hell; the resulting images are both creepy and highly disturbing. The hell displayed here is a labyrinthine maze of ancient corridors, populated by the weird figures of giant babies with their mouths sewn shut, undulating bloodstained bodies, and a clown who juggles his own eyeballs. Then we get skinless corpses writing ""I AM IN HELL HELP ME"" on walls with their own blood and one of the scariest mental asylums I've seen on film (you know, the 'maintenance' level).The special effects are varied and entertaining, aside from the huge spinning demonic shape in the sky at the end which is a little bit rough around the edges. The makeup is gruesome and the cenobites are as disgustingly awful as ever. Even some cool stop motion animation pops up at the end of the movie to menace our heroes. The music is evocative, the pacing excellent and Tony Randel's direction top-notch - compare this to a pitiful mess like DREAM DEMON and you'll see what I mean. The film also benefits from a high calibre of acting from most of the cast, some of whom return from the first film.First up is Ashley Laurence reprising her role to good effect as the feisty Kirsty, although Imogen Boorman stands out more as the strangely beautiful mute girl who has a way with jigsaws. Clare Higgins is back and even more deadly-but-beautiful than ever. However, the film is commanded by Kenneth Cranham playing the fiendishly perverse Dr. Channard who eventually ends up becoming a new, even more horrific Cenobite (one with plenty of comedic one-liners too). Cranham's initially decent doctor soon turns out to be a sweaty bastard as the cracks start to show and it's another excellent performance from the underrated actor. Watch out for William Hope playing a young male doctor, Kyle, who helps Kirsty in her quest.Doug Bradley is perfect as Pinhead although largely underused here, what with all the other sub-plots going on. HELLBOUND: HELLRAISER II is an imaginative piece of work with a truly unique visionary style, a masterpiece of the macabre and not for weak stomachs - this comes highly recommended. Unfortunately it marked the end of quality in the series which, with the arrival of HELLRAISER III : HELL ON EARTH, turned into just another US horror franchise, albeit one with a little more class than most.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
2,SnoopyStyle,love the Cenobites,6,18 January 2016,"After the first movie, Kirsty Cotton is admitted to a psychiatric hospital under the care of Dr. Philip Channard and his assistant Kyle MacRae. The police has recovered the mattress where her stepmother Julia died on. She urges everybody to destroy the mattress but she doesn't know that Channard has been searching for the Cenobites. Tiffany is a mute patient obsessed with puzzles. Using the mattress and a patient, Channard is to retrieve a skinless Julia. MacRae witnesses the horrific scene and tells Kirsty.Clive Barker's disturbing ideas continue to be my favorite part of the franchise. The other world looks interesting. The human characters and the actors playing them continue to be my least favorite. I would be perfectly happy to have all new people. It would also mean that the flashbacks and recalls are not necessary. That's a good thing. This movie refers a lot to the first movie.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
3,gavin6942,"Some Powerful Scenes, But Overall Rather Weak",7,28 December 2008,"Kirsty Cotton (Ashley Laurence) survived the first attack from Hell in ""Hellraiser"", but her troubles are far from over. She is now locked up in a mental ward run by an occult-obsessed doctor (how appropriate) and her evil stepmother, Julia (Clare Higgins) refuses to stay dead.This film is incredibly polarizing, I fear, because it has such strong qualities of both good and bad. The bad include special effects that really date the movie (though are still superior to much of today's work) and the introduction of a certain level of silliness that pervades the later films. The doctor as a cenobite is a bit strange in form, and opens the door for the even more bizarre creatures in part three.There are some plot and continuity issues, such as wondering where Kirsty's boyfriend from part one went. And while the film seems to try to explain loose ends from the first film, it creates a whole lot more... the maze (presumably hell) is not adequately explained, nor is the role of the giant puzzle box. While some of this is addressed in later films, it seems that what we learn later tends to contradict what we see here.But let us say some good things about this one. First and foremost, the Julia without skin looks incredible. It is hard to say they topped Frank without skin (from the original) but I think they did. The way she comes crawling up out of the bed... her blood-soaked flesh. Beautiful. ""Right to Die"" owes a huge debt to the work in this film, the same way that this film owes a debt to ""Bride of Frankenstein"" with its use of thunder and bandages...We also have to give the gore creators some credit, because the insane man with the knife was pretty intense... actually, all the asylum inmates are well-played. For all the flaws this film may have, they more than made up for it with a couple of memorable scenes. While my favorite in the series is ""Bloodline"" (I believe I am in the minority on this), I think part two may have been the last great addition. Sequels were not necessary, and obviously everything after part four just gives the franchise a bad name.Anchor Bay has released a twentieth anniversary edition, and I would strongly recommend it. Older features, such as an audio commentary from 2001, are available, as well as a few new featurettes. ""The Soul Patrol"" features new interviews with Barbie Wilde, Simon Bamford and Nicholas Vince. ""Outside the Box"" features a new interview with director Tony Randel and ""The Doctor is In"" features a new interview with Kenneth Cranham. As someone who has met Ashley Laurence, Doug Bradley, Clive Barker and each of the cenobites, I have a strong personal interest in this film. I can say that the Anchor Bay edition is easily the best to date and any ""Hellraiser"" fan would be making a mistake in getting an older, inferior edition.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
4,jboothmillard,Hellbound: Hellraiser II,4,21 April 2013,"The first film was a big hit, and in this first sequel and all following the leading villain became an icon of the genre, even though I had heard low reviews for this second film I did still want to watch it. Basically in the early 1920's or 1930's Captain Elliot Spencer (Doug Bradley) was one of the few people to solve the puzzle box, and besides opening up the gates of Hell, for him the consequences were much worse, he was forced into the cube to be chained and have nails hammered in his head, so he was transformed into Cenobite leader Pinhead. It forwards to the present day, where Kirsty Cotton (Ashley Laurence) who survived the events of the last film, her father and twisted stepmother killed, and she has woken in a psychiatric hospital. Of course no-one believes her stories about what happened to the people in her house, so she is kept in the institute to try and rest and at some point be studied by strange psychiatrist Dr. Philip Channard (Kenneth Cranham), who has been secretly studying the occult dimensions himself for years. One day hiding in his office, Channard's assistant Kyle MacRae (William Hope) witnesses the doctor leading an innocent mentally ill patient to the blood covered bed sheet that Kirsty warned could bring her stepmother Julia Cotton (Clare Higgins) back to life, and sure enough she is skinless and seeking more flesh to nourish herself. Kyle now believes Kirsty and plans to help her get out of the institute, but she knows the doctor will also plan to somehow bring back the Cenobites, and indeed he does this using innocent young semi-catatonic patient Tiffany (Imogen Boorman) who has a gift and incredible skill for solving puzzles, so she opens the puzzle box. Pinhead and the Cenobites, Chatterer (Nicholas Vince), The Female (Barbie Wilde) and Butterball (Simon Bamford) do not harm Tiffany because they know she was forced into releasing them, and Channard and Julia meanwhile travel through the passageways in the other dimension inside the cube, he is shown all sadomasochistic pleasures that await, before being turned into a Cenobite himself. Kirsty meanwhile also wanders through the maze to find her father, who she believes has been contacting her from beyond the grave from the Hell world, but in fact she discovers it was her uncle Frank Cotton (Sean Chapman), and at that moment Julia arrives to kill him in revenge, by ripping his heart out. Kirsty and Tiffany manage to get out of Hell world Leviathon, but they realise the dark realm has begun to crossover with the real world, so they return to close the box from the inside, and transformed Channard wanting to seize control of everything tries to stop both them and the other Cenobites. In the fight the Cenobites are all killed and revert to their true human forms, and Julia returns momentarily to interfere, but the cube is closed, and Julia is revealed to be Kirsty wearing her skin, and they escape back to the hospital before the portal closes, of course in the end while they walk away free a final event occurs with the bloody mattress that will lead to events continuing in the next film. Also starring Oliver Smith as Mr. Browning and Deborah Joel as Skinless Julia. The monsters are just about as interesting as the previous film, especially Pinhead of course who we see the origin of and has all the philosophical dialogue, Laurence isn't quite as convincing as the heroine like she was before, the special effects to create the bloody torture and deaths is still worth watching, but the story is muddled, it is obviously more about the blood and body count, so while fans will be happy enough it is a slightly disappointing horror. Okay!",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
5,Tweekums,A gory sequel that takes us to the realm of the Cenobytes,8,17 December 2018,"After the events of the first film Kirsty has survived but is in a psychiatric institution under the supervision of Doctor Channard. She tells the police that the bloody mattress found in the house must be destroyed but Channard has it taken to his house; he then takes a lunatic there and gives him a razor which he uses to kill himself. The blood soaks into the mattress and Kirsty's step-mother, Julia, returns from the dead... minus her skin. It is clear that Channard has been studying the Cenobytes and has several of their puzzle boxes. He gets another patient, a mute girl named Tiffany for has a penchant for puzzle solving to open the box. Soon we are taken into the realm of the Cenobytes as Kirsty searches for her father and Channard wishes to explore its more extreme elements.The original film featured some fairly gory moments; this is more of the same. It opens with a series of 'highlights' from the original before setting up the continuing story. The story is effective in delivering new terrors as well as building on the old ones. It also manages to tell us more about the Cenobytes and how they came to be. There are some weaknesses; most obviously the way the apparently unstoppable Cenobytes are apparently defeated by a new Cenobyte. It was good to see Ashley Laurence return as Kirsty and Clare Higgins as her undead step mother; there were also some good new characters; most obviously Kenneth Cranham as the sinister Dr Channard and young Imogen Boorman as Tiffany. The physical special effects are impressive in their goriness. Overall I'd say this is an effective sequel which fans of the original are sure to like and those that didn't almost certainly won't.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
6,BA_Harrison,What the hell?,6,21 December 2008,"It had been a long time since my initial viewing of Hellbound, but I remember not enjoying it very much. However, wishing to add a comment about the film here on IMDb for the sake of completeness (I had already reviewed the original and part 3, and intend to watch the further instalments in the future), I decided to refresh my memory whilst also giving it another chance to impress me.And besides, it also seemed like a good excuse for me to get another fix of the lovely Ashley Laurence!Directed by Tony Randel, Hellbound follows on immediately from the events in Hellraiser, with a traumatised Kirsty (Laurence) recovering in a mental institution. In the first of several rather contrived plot developments, the head of the institute, Dr. Channard (Kenneth Cranham), turns out to be a student of all things 'Cenobite' and, upon hearing Kirsty ranting about demons and boxes, decides to seize his opportunity to experience Hell first-hand.After acquiring the blood-soaked mattress on which Kirsty's step-mother Julia (Clare Higgins) died, the nasty doctor takes one of his institute's more extreme nutters, who believes that he is covered in maggots, and hands the poor fellow an open cut-throat razor. The seriously disturbed lunatic slashes at the imaginary creepy-crawlies on his flesh, cutting himself to ribbons in the process (definitely not a scene for the squeamish!). The flow of blood revives Julia who, in one of the films most shocking and disturbing sequences, crawls from the mattress to feed.The twisted Dr. Channard then forms a bizarre relationship with the semi-rejuvenated Julia, bringing her more sustenance (and indulging with her in the occasional spot of slap 'n' tickle) until she is fully revived. In return for helping her, Julia (who thankfully no longer sports that horrible hairdo she had in Hellraiser) shows Channard the key to unlocking the doorway to hell: Tiffany, another of his patients, who is adept at solving all manner of puzzles (another convenient coincidence, methinks!).Meanwhile, Kirsty has seen a bloody vision of her father pleading to be released from his suffering in Hell, and also seeks a way into the world of the Cenobites...Whilst I am sure all of this twisted sado-masochistic, occult-based nonsense makes perfect sense to creator Clive Barker, who obviously views this world (and beyond) in ways I cannot (or do not) want to imagine, it appears to me that Hellbound's director Randel and screenwriter Peter Atkins were not quite so clear about the author's vision when making this film (and who can blame them?).Hellbound begins well enough, but gradually becomes more and more confusing, until the totally incomprehensible finale which takes place in a labyrinthine version of hell consisting of dodgy matte paintings and cheap visual effects. Although there is undeniably loads of inventive imagery and gruesome gore to ensure that the film is never boring, it is way too messy (and I'm not talking about the blood and guts) and incoherent to be a satisfying experience.Throw in a silly cenobite version of Channard that makes wise-cracks ala Freddy Krueger, and a twist ending in which Kirsty wears Julia's skin to win her battle against evil, and you have a film that, although not quite as bad as I had remembered, is a long way from the quality of the original.5.5 out of 10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
7,Coventry,Evil grows on to its path ...,10,10 October 2003,"Hellbound is the fascinating and almost excellent sequel to the greatest horror story ever written: Hellraiser by Clive Barker. This movie is a must see if you enjoyed the first one ( and I can't imagine you haven't ). Hellbound is a logical continuing of the saga and begins almost immediately where the first one left off. Like its predecessor, it's a tale of pure terror. Like no other movies, the Hellraiser films create this nightmare world you sure don't want to be a part of...I didn't think it would be possible but Hellbound creates and even more morbid and dark atmosphere than Hellraiser. Images of pure horror are showed here and it certainly ain't a pretty sight from time to time. Gruesome make-up effects and clearly showed violence make this motion picture the prototype of pure horror. Add a powerful plot and some terrifying characters to that you got yourself a pure horrorfest and even a damn good movie in general. Doug Bradley returns as the most charismatic horror icon ever created. Pinhead, the lead cenobite. Also the very beautiful Ashley Laurence is back to take up her role again as Kirsty. Too bad these movies were the only highlights in her career. I would have wanted to see a lot more of her. Hellbound takes place in hell for a large part, and it's shown as an endless labyrinth filled with deadly traps, unpleasant surprises and nightmarish visions. Actually, just like you fear it to be...SPOILERS...the story begins a few hours after the first film finished. Kirsty still is in shock and she's brought to a mental institution. Over there, Dr. Channard is in charge and he happens to be totally obsessed by the mysterious box. He manages to bring Julia (who died in part one ) back to life but in return for that he asks Julia to show him what Hell is really like. In the meantime, Kirsty still is convinced that she can bring back her father and, along with a mute girl called Tiffany, she faces the Cenobites again. Pinhead and his fellow Cenobites don't want to show any mercy no more but Kirsty has a plan to survive...END SPOILERS !!!In my point of view, Hellbound is the perfect horror. I admit there are some flaws to it ( and even a few mistakes ) but it's the ideal movie if you want to be scared, intrigued and fascinated by the more macabre aspects of cinema. I know Robert Ebert doesn't like it very much but what the HELL does he know about it ?!?Favorite ""rewind""-scene : So many to choose from, but I'll certainly go for an early scene in the movie. Through a pan, the attic of Dr.Channard is shown. This attic contains all the victims Julia needed to become her old self again. Horrific, cruel and brute...but oh so beautiful",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
8,Theo Robertson,For Gorehounds Only,5,23 May 2002,"I admit to not being much of a fan of horror films , I can take them or leave them , but that doesn`t stop me from knowing what a good horror film should be. Horror films should be about irony , protestant ethics and above all - fun . That`s why HELLRAISER is my all time favourite horror film . I`m not a fan of sequels either so I wasn`t really expecting much with HELLBOUND which is just as well because this a poor film with some disturbing scenes that are just plain cruelThe script is really bad with confusing continuity with the first film . Why is Kirsty confined to a hospital ? She looked relatively well in the final scene of HELLRAISER , but no explanation is forthcoming . And - unlike stomach churning blood letting - explanations are a scarce commidity in this film , we see a woman which I take it is Tiffany`s mother pleading for someone to help her daughter then a hand clamping over her mouth . What`s that about then ? It`s got nothing do with the plot because HELLBOUND has no plot , everyone runs back and forth through corridors like a bad episode of DOCTOR WHO. Another irritant is the fact that everyone states the obvious "" It`s coming ....it certainly is ..... Weird . F****** weird "" and the all time classic howler "" It was horrible . She had no skin "" Maybe HELLBOUND was originally written for radio ? Oh and watch out for the cop out ending where Kirsty saves TiffanyClare Higgins and Kenneth Cranham do the best they can with the script and they give the best performances of the film which isn`t saying much. Ashley Laurence is a very attractive young woman but being drop dead gorgeous is no substitute for acting talent and it comes as no surprise she didn`t win an oscar for HELLBOUND , but the worst performance award goes to William Hope as Kyle though perhaps I shouldn`t be so critical since he gets landed with the worst lines and Sir Alec Guinness would be hard pressed to make something of the laughable dialogue Kyle has to speakTony Randell  seems to have taken the script too literally :"" It`s a dire script so this calls for dire directing "" Watch out for the umpteen revealing mistakes that can be spotted and also look out for the atrocious editing especially at the end where Channard menaces Tiffany . Tiffany has a terrified look on her face then when the camera cuts to another angle she has an entirely different expression ! This happens just before Kirsty saves the day . I know I`ve mentioned that  before , but I`ll mention it again because I couldn`t  believe the cop out ending, what an insult. Tony Randell also seems to think horror films are all about blood and boy do we get it by the bucket load . Most infamous scene as everyone has pointed out is the lunatic with razor blade which is just sickHELLBOUND does have one thing that makes it worth watching and that`s the music . Christopher Young deserved at the very least an oscar nomination for the haunting score , but it`s a shame we got saddled with such a poor unpleasant film",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
9,Theo Robertson,Review Of The Unrated Version,5,15 December 2002,"****** CONTAINS SPOILERS ******I`ve noticed many of the reviewers on this page have seen the unrated version of HELLBOUND . How they managed to see it was of little interest to me , what was of interest to me was that there was absolutely nothing of interest on the satellite channels at one in the morning . What on earth could I watch ? Oh HELLBOUND: HELLRAISER 2 a film I first saw eleven years ago on the same satillite station . Well there was nothing else on so I just decided to watch it because Ashley Laurence is very easy on the eyes while Christopher Young`s music is easy on the ears . The titles started and Elliot finds himself getting turned into a cenobite , except this was far more explicit than I remembered it . I realised I was watching the unrated version .I didn`t like the BBFC edited version much but found myself watching this version out of morbid curiousity . Boy is this one sick and twisted film . The maniac slashing himself with a razor vainly trying to get the maggots off him was bad enough in the edited print but here it just goes on and on and on as he slices himself apart , and that`s before Julia turns up to finish the job . And we get to see other loving close-ups of mutilation and maimings . Frank pulls his skin off , Channard has cheesewire penetrating his skin , a patient has his arm sliced off and Channard`s demise is more graphic than in the original version . I have no doubt this is the most gory British film ever made . It may not tear your soul apart but it will churn your stomach .It`s one thing cutting out all the blood and guts , but what about reinserting all the bits that would have helped the film make sense ? There is a segment in this version that has Kirsty entering her mother`s house but this adds nothing to the plot which is full of holes . Perhaps the most obvious plot hole is when Kirsty shows Pinhead a photo when he was human . We know the army officer and Pinhead are the same person because of the opening scene but there is no way Kirsty would know this",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
10,Hey_Sweden,Decent follow-up to Clive Barker's horror hit.,7,28 October 2012,"This film begins, appropriately, with sort of a highlight reel of memorable ""Hellraiser"" moments, and then we see what sort of boat Kirsty Cotton (Ashley Laurence) is in: confined to a mental institution, where the head of the place, Dr. Channard (Kenneth Cranham) is an occult-obsessed wacko who's collected himself various artifacts. Soon the bad doctor has managed to resurrect Kirsty's evil stepmom Julia (Clare Higgins) and the whole bunch of them end up in Hell where Kirsty desperately tries to find her late father. This series continues to be a good bet for horror fans with its accent on graphic mayhem, its assault of incredibly surreal horrors, of both the mental and the physical variety, and its articulate, intelligent villain Pinhead. Each character has their own Hell, of course, and we get a taste of each. Veteran New World employee Tony Randel makes his official directing debut (after doing some uncredited work on ""Def-Con 4"") and makes watching ""Hellbound: Hellraiser II"" an effective sensory experience, if not particularly strong in the narrative department. (Then again, this was partly due to the script requiring hasty rewrites after actor Andrew Robinson declined to reprise the role of Larry Cotton.) Still, it's good fun much of the time, and it gives us just a little background into the character of Pinhead (Doug Bradley) and gives him and his fellow Cenobites some more opposition than usual as Dr. Channard undergoes something of a rebirth. It also gives us a rather delicious antagonist as Julia is in full evil bitch mode (the sexy Higgins looks like she's having a great time) and Kirsty is once again an appealing young protagonist. Sean Chapman and Oliver Smith reprise their roles as Uncle Frank and his skinless version (respectively), Angus MacInnes plays the part of the suspicious homicide detective Ronson, and ""Aliens"" fans will be amused to see actor William Hope, who was the ineffective Lt. Gorman in that film, playing the helpful doctor Kyle here. Adding some punch are the entertaining visual and makeup effects, while the production designer, Michael Buchanan, and cinematographer, Robin Vidgeon, give this production a striking look. It's not in the same league as its predecessor, understandably, but is still very acceptable entertainment that does have some fine moments, and a nice twist near the end, on the way to its setting-up-the-next-sequel conclusion. Seven out of 10.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
11,poolandrews,"Gore drenched sequel, well worth watching.",9,27 October 2004,"The first and only decent sequel to Clive Barkers impressive original Hellraiser. Hellbound:Hellraiser 2 starts almost immediately after the event of the original. After a brief recap of Hellraiser up to this point featuring footage form the original, we see another unsuspecting victim, Captain Elliot Spencer (Doug Bradley without his Pinhead special make up effects applied) solve the mystery of the Chinese puzzle box and is impaled with hooks that tear his skin, razors cut lines in his head and an unseen thing inserts long pins into his scalp and thus creating Pinhead (Doug Bradley with the make up), the lead Cenobite from the Hellraiser films. Kirsty (Ashley Laurence again) is seen in a hospital room, the police have discovered rotting maggot infested corpses in Kirstys dads house, like the original in its uncut version this film is very gory and explicit. A detective named Ronson (Angus MacInnes) questions Kirsty, she doesn't make much sense to him, speaking of demons and that her dad is trapped in hell and still suffering. The detective doesn't believe it and hands her over to Dr Channard (Kenneth Cranham). Channard uses the information he gets from Kirsty to re-animate Julia (the returning Clare Higgins). He also uses a patient under his care named Tiffany (Imogen Boorman) to solve the puzzle of the box and reopen the door to hell, Pinhead and his Cenobite friends from the original, the Butterball Cenobite (Simon Bamford), the Chatterer Cenobite (Nicholas Vince) and the female Cenobite (Barbie Wilde, who I've met in real life by the way!) also make an appearance and join the fun. Kirsty discovers what Channard is doing and follows him into hell to try and save her dad. Frank Cotton (Sean Chapman another returning cast member from the original) also turns up and soon after loses his heart and skin at the hands of a vengeful Julia. Channard gets turned into a Cenobite and all hell starts to break lose. This time directed by Tony Randel, Hellbound is another impressive film, it recaptures the dark feel and hellish atmosphere of the original. Once again the special make up effects are explicit and well done, people slicing themselves up with straight razors in a very nasty scene, more skinless people and corpses, slit throats, hand amputations, brain surgery and all sorts of other bodily mutilation are presented for our viewing pleasure in the uncut version, which is the one I'm reviewing here. The script co-written by Barker keeps thing moving nicely, even though someone should tell them police officers don't carry guns in the UK, towards the start of the movie a police man while searching the house from the original gets scared by a corpse that falls out of a wardrobe and proceeds to shoot it several times, as I said the police in the UK don't carry guns, I know I've lived here all my life! A very minor complaint. This time the film is mostly set in Hell and we get lots of perverse imagery to convince us. I especially like the juggler who's using his own eyeballs to juggle with. After this the Hellraiser franchise went down hill, becoming too Americanized, part 3 for instance was set in an American city and featured Pinhead and his Cenobites killing lots of teenagers, just like countless other soulless unoriginal slasher films. Hellbound:Hellraiser 2 in my opinion is the only worthy sequel to the original, its dark and has the same perverse atmosphere, it features even more blood gore and mutilation and doesn't feature stupid teenagers been hacked up. A very entertaining horror film for those with the stomach. I liked this just as much as the original, high praise. The version I watched was the recent British special edition DVD from Anchor Bay UK, which is the uncut version, the only way to watch it as far as I'm concerned. Recommended.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
12,grantss,Quite disappointing after the first movie,3,9 August 2015,"Quite disappointing after the first movie.Hellraiser II picks up where the first movie left off. Kirsty (played bu Ashley Laurence) is in an institution after her experiences of the first movie. She is then visited by the gang of ghouls we previously met...The first movie was quite original for a horror movie. (Not that this says much, as most horror movies are incredibly formulaic and predictable). The plot was fairly solid too, with good direction and special effects.This, the second movie, is not anywhere near as good. Plot feels random, unoriginal and unengaging. The story just lurches from one contrived, inexplicable horror scene to another.Not worth watching - save your time.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
13,Boba_Fett1138,Simply a good movie and sequel.,7,11 January 2010,"Of course the most originality from the first movie is gone in this movie but they still did a more than great job with its story. The movie still manages to become an original sequel thanks to its story and it prevents the movie from becoming just a rehash of the first movie.It's a movie that picks different settings this time but still uses pretty much all of the characters from the first movie. Of course the movie also introduces some new characters and it explains more about the history and mystery of the cube and the its evil hellish characters, led by Pinhead. I love how some of the characters from the first movie suddenly and unexpectedly pop up and still serve a purpose within the movie as well.The movie takes us more into the labyrinth this time which makes the movie perhaps too different from the fist movie and a bit overlong toward its end but it also still helps to make the movie interesting and helps you want to watch the other sequels as well, to find out more about this world and characters. This time there is plenty of more gore, which no doubt was also due to the movie its higher budget this time. It's also pretty much really an effect loaded movie. You could perhaps say that this movie is more of a standard horror movie than the first one was but still not without loosing any of its own originality and creativity. The Hellraiser-series is one of those series that succeeded in creating a whole universe with followers, something that that many horror-series succeeded in. A great follow-up to the first movie.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Hellbound - Hellraiser II

Honestly, an ordeal like that is enough to make anyone crazy and/or suicidal. As luck would have it, she ends up in a hospital where the main doctor has a collection of hell cubes as well as the bloody mattress a bunch of people were killed on.That bloody mattress and the sick doctor were a path for Julia (Clare Higgins) to return. Once she did the old kill to rejuvenate thing she allowed the doctor to have one of his patients solve the hell cube and open up the gates to the Leviathan. That's when the real fun began, because that's when the Cinobites joined the fray.""Hellbound"" was a good sequel, but I only have one exception. How did Kirsty have time to dress herself in Julia's discarded skin? And she dressed herself in the skin OVER her clothes without the smallest seam, bump, or groove.

15,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Great follow-up to a classic,9,28 October 2014,"Having survived the Cenobites from before, Kirsty Cotton is confined to a mental hospital where she sparks the interest of the institute's head psychologist who unleashes the creatures once again.While some elements might not work for everyone, this is still quite an enjoyable effort. The biggest effort here is the increased blood and gore featured, as this one ups the violence over the first one so much more. Bypassing the traditional hook pulling apart a body, we do get a particularly gruesome scene where Pinhead is shown how he gets his name-sake that fits in the rest of the film as it features an on-screen transformation for a Cenobite, the appearance of skinless people, several mutilated dead bodies scattered throughout the film and particularly graphic kills that splatter all over the place. There is tons more blood throughout, including a retread of the skinless person idea from part one that works quite a bit better due to the extended time spent doing this. Also, the increased time overall with the Cenobites was greatly appreciated. With them being almost relegated to cameos in that one, here they become so relevant to the plot that it's a great joy to watch them all get plenty of screen time. As well, there's some nice ideas as the descent into Hell is handled well, the Cenobites are integrated into the story pretty believably, and the whole scheme of events plays out excitingly since this never becomes boring. The visuals are a big reason for that as it's a great-looking film with all the special effects and scenery which makes it a great film to get lost in. The film does have some moments where the plot doesn't know where it's going, jumping around between several different themes and motives quite often different one moment to the next. This is all the result of a haphazard final half that makes for a convoluted storyline, though there's still enough context to really make some sense of this one at times even if it requires a couple times to figure it out. Granted it's a little confusing, but this is still every bit as good as the original, and then a little more in certain areas.Rated UR/R: Extreme Graphic Violence, some Language, Brief Nudity, and a shadowy, blurry sex scene.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II

Obviously I wanted to see the other movies, so I saw the first one, hated it.Seeing the second one back then, I was blown away by the visuals and the haunting sound of the horn. On a second viewing nearly twenty years later, the visuals are all there, but it's just very, very boring.It's basically a little re-run of the first movie, but with the added back story, and when the makers have enough of that, they decide to literally send everyone to hell.Once Cranham turns into a cenobite, it goes beyond ridiculous almost into parody, and Pinhead is just, well I can't believe he has such a cult status.I understand why people love these movies, they are macabre and sadistic, and look sumptuous, but for me, it's just a little boring.I'd pick Nightbreed over this any day.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II

The tone was set, welcome to hell. Be aware to see the full uncut clocking in at 1 hour 39 minutes. A lot of versions are 4 minutes shorter some even clock in at 78 minutes!The story continues after what happened in part one, Kirsty's family is dead and she's in some kind of asylum. Sadly for her, the head of the institution, Dr Channard, is an occultist and resurrect the cenobites.If you haven't seen part one, there's enough of samples shown to understand it all. We also see how pinhead was created and who he was in real life. On part of the effects, just wait an 26 minutes into the flick and the gore comes already in. But once Channard is falling in love with Julia things go wrong and hell breaks lose but things also go wrong with this flick. The cenobites are destroyed as is pinhead and let that be the strength of part 1. Without pinhead you don't have a hellraiser flick. He's in it but not that much it's all about Dr. Channard and Jennifer, a child which can solve puzzles. So she will open hell.What annoyed me was also the fact that the effects used are outdated right now. The gore is in tact but the other effects are not, some are done in stop/motion and that's not exactly what we want to see even back in 1988.

21,Smells_Like_Cheese,Back to tear the soul apart!,7,11 February 2012,"The Cenobites are back to bring more hell on Earth! So a few years ago I rented Hellraiser, from the clips that I saw it seemed more than promising and it sure was a great horror movie. Clive Barker has the wildest imagination and goes deep into the nightmares that we have and puts them on screen. I give him a lot of credit for putting displeasing images on the big screen, as unsettling as the images are they made for a great horror movie and created a terrifying icon in Pinhead. I don't know why I waited so long to see the sequels, maybe I didn't have the opportunity but I did find them cheap at the store the other day and without hesitation bought them. So I watched Hellbound Hellraiser 2 and while it's definitely not strong in the plot like the first film was, the visuals are done with such love and imagination we get a horror movie that doesn't hold back on making you squirm.Kirsty wakes in the psychiatric hospital, where she is questioned about the events leading up to the destruction of her home, which involved her stepmother, Julia, and a bloody mattress. Kirsty tells the police that her uncle, Frank, opened a puzzle box to an alternate dimension populated by monsters named Cenobites who torture human quarry for sadomasochistic purposes. The story amazes the detectives, who are incredulous and take the bloody mattress as evidence. Kirsty is turned over to Dr. Channard and his assistant, Kyle, who instantly becomes smitten with Kirsty. That night, Kirsty befriends another patient, Tiffany, a semi-catatonic young girl with an incredible skill for solving puzzles. Later, in her room, Kirsty finds a message written in blood stating ""I AM IN HELL. HELP ME."" Believing it was sent by her father, Kirsty tells her story to Kyle, who encourages her to tell Channard about the Cenobites. Now with Kyle and Tiffany's help, Kirsty wants to get her father back from the sadistic Cenobites and must confront them once again.My main complaint about the film is that the plot isn't too well constructed. This was definitely meant more to upset the stomach than challenge the mind. That's the thing I admire about the first film, it was very gory but had a very strong plot and something that hadn't been done before. Why Kirsty is so quick to go back to the Cenobites was crazy to me, she thinks her father is in Hell, but believes it so fast. I would have questioned if I was her if it was due to my trauma or if this really was happening? Also SPOILER: when Tiffany thinks that Julia is helping her in the end, but she pulls the skin off and it reveals that it was Kirsty and she had gotten in Julia's skin in order to trick the bad guy, how did she get in that skin so quickly and so well? Movie magic as usual. Also that Kirsty shows Pinhead an old picture of what he used to look like as a human and we have an Oprah moment where he's touched, I don't like Pinhead to be touched, I want him to be bad! But Dr. Channard makes for a great villain, he's so evil that he destroys the other Cenobites within a snap! His make up was terrific as well and very haunting. The visuals were great and the story was still very spooky. I would recommend it over all, it's a film that doesn't hold up for the story but as a continuation from the first film, it's worth the look.7/10",Hellbound - Hellraiser II

Whatever the case, I thought it was a very decent sequel which took the story forward in a worthwhile way. It has some really crazy and perverse scenes and imagination on display. Funnily enough, the Cenobites are only utilized sparingly and are given a human side (which I wasn't entirely keen on). The budget probably doesn't quite match the ambition but on the whole this is definitely a good companion piece to the first movie.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II

24,KineticSeoul,Even more nightmarish this time around,6,30 May 2014,"This one seems to be the fan favorite so when it comes to the ""Hellraiser"" franchise. And this is a pretty freakish and creepy movie that delves into the dimensional world of Pinhead. I personally found this one to be more entertaining in a way, but not as scary or as creepy as the first one. It is however more freakish. This sequel actually does a really good job of connecting with the first ""Hellraiser"" movie and takes place just about right afterwards. I guess one of the reason why this one is most fan favorite is because of how it balances out the environments. Which takes place place in a asylum and some sort of dimensional hell. One of the factors that made this movie not as scary is how it shows the human side of Pinhead and his origin even if it's very slightly shown. The mystery behind Pinhead and his crew is what made him scary, like he is some sort of intelligent ancient being. This one seems to show Pinhead to be on the weaker side. Sure, sometimes villains should have some weaknesses. But the human side just takes away from a villain such as him. I don't know, but I just thought Pinhead would have been more effective horror icon if he was some sort of intelligent ancient being that has a certain code or rule that he abides by and thus can be reasoned with. This one does have more nightmarish elements though and seemed like a subliminal journey into the dark side of humanity and hell. This sequel really does indulges more into the creepy designs by Clive Barker. This is a entertaining flick that delves more into the Hellraiser universe and indulges more on Clive Barker's design and visuals. Oh and Brad Pitt also makes a appearance when he was a teenage girl.6.3/10",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
25,thesar-2,"Your suffering will be legendary, even in hell! – I've actually used that line",6,24 July 2010,"Freddy should be p*ssed. Pinhead's not only trying to take some of slasher shares, but pretty much just copied the superior (1987's) A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors. Let's compare, shall we?Both take place in an insane asylum. Both have a blank stare blonde. Both have a doctor who doesn't believe up front, but starts to both side and help the main star. Both have a heroine that strangely looks like Heather Langenkamp. Both also have a character named Kirsty (yeah, I realize she was named that originally, but it's still too close.) Both involve a labyrinth of one's darkest fears. Both have a wise-cracking villain, including a new baddie who has clay-mation snakes, with blades, no less, coming out of his hands. Both have bad lightening affects. Heck, both have mute inmates with powers integral to the plot.Wow, I didn't know it was that many. Probably more, but suffice to say, Pinhead's first sequel, the only one in the long-running series that's a really a direct continuation, Hellbound: Hellraiser II isn't as bad as I've portrayed it, but it's not up to #1's standards. They didn't even improve on the computer-generated ""flashes of light"" that causes more laughter than fear.Taking place seconds, then hours after the first one, Kirsty (Laurence) is magically in the aforementioned asylum being questioned for the deaths, including her father, in her late uncle's home. Quickly, the good doctor, Channard (Cranham) intervenes as he's a ""Brain Doc"" who knows how crazies work. It's obviously, up front, he's got ulterior motives for Kirsty, her next room over neighbor, the puzzle-solving mute, Tiffany (Boorman) and the objects in Kirsty's outlandish story of the Attack of the Cenobites.For plot's sake and the audience who may have not seen the original, Kirsty suddenly knows more than her character could possibly about the magical doorway opening box that calls upon the Cenobites and their motivesand what all happened at the house she just escaped when her family was wiped out in the first movie. Oh, and conveniently, not only is her love interest out of the picture, but she doesn't give him a second thought.So, let's see, she gets a message from her father, who's now in hell and it's not too difficult to tell that may not, in fact, be from her real father. Nevertheless, the first chance she gets, she dives headfirst into the labyrinth of Hades to rescue him. I thought most of those there just want a glass of iced water?Meanwhile, Doc Chan acquires the blood-soaked mattress where the Original's Diva Julia (Higgins) laid to rest. He knows (again, thanks convenient plot) enough to take ""nobodies"" or criminally insane patients of his, to that mattress, and allow them to kill themselves – in a really grotesque manner – to bring back Julia. Her transformation from the red mattress that's only fit for a Motel 6, into real flesh and blood kind of fast forward's the process that seemed to take a lot longer in #1.After the obvious parallel with The Bride of Frankenstein, or is that Bride of Re-Animator?, he willingly enters Hell's Maze to, I guess, learn more than his education allowed.There's a lot more, and I've only skimmed the surface. Suffice to say, all parties involved have fun in Pinhead's domain, each with their own agenda and a lot of plot holes surface – such as why there's no rules to Hell, then there are, then real is fake and real is real, etc, etc. (Not to give it away, but the ending's death to the new Cenobite and the spinning post had me shocked. A WTF shock, that is.)Pinhead finally shows up half way through, and he's been missed here, since I really did think I was watching Nightmare on Elm Street 3B. His lines were excellent: ""Time to play,"" ""Your suffering will be legendary, even in Hell"" and ""How can it send us back, child? We're already here"" are just a few of some of my all time favorite lines. The good-doc also has some good lines (""The Doctor is In,"") but unfortunately, they overlapped the score a bit too loud and it was troublesome to actually hear him at the most opportune times.It certainly up'd the ante in blood – even for today's standards, this is pretty gruesome, and they kept up with the complex plot with multiple characters and story lines. The actors were delicious, namely Bradley, Higgins and Cranham. Even Booran tried – she did have a good line herself: ""Shit!""It's a good compliment to the first movie, though inferior. So, it's recommended, even with its multiple flaws and outrageously hilarious special effects – even for 1988.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
26,gridoon,Matchlessly gory.,4,23 May 2002,"If you watch this one for the first time unprepared, you may actually feel sick to your stomach (I know I did). There is a self-mutilation scene, early on, that goes far beyond anything you've ever seen in, say, ""Day of the Dead"" or ""Maniac"". If you manage to sit through that, you'll probably be able to sit through the rest of the film, though it's not really worth it. The gore here is mostly gratuitous and the story pretty weak, making little sense and ending without a proper resolution. Many fans of the series were displeased with the introduction of ""the human side"" of the Cenobites, but frankly it's the one fresh angle the filmmakers managed to come up with, to give the film whatever reason for existence it has.

27,Robert_duder,Brilliant sequel that captures all that made the original so incredible,9,12 July 2011,"Sequels are hard. Sometimes they are done brilliantly well and sometimes they shame the original. Horror sequels are especially hard and when you have the brilliance of the original Hellraiser it would be hard to capture that same world again. But guess what? They did it and very well. It does not surpass the original, and it is lacking on some of the key qualities but regardless Hellraiser 2 raised the bar for this series. They knew what they were doing. More blood, more guts, more story, more of the original characters and they ran with it. Honestly the sequel starts out on shaky ground because it doesn't feel like it has the same strength of story but once the ball gets rolling it really does complement the original film. Best of all in the final moments of the film which takes place essentially inside 'hell' or inside the puzzle box, once again the special effects are absolutely outstanding. Not only that but instead of just having Pinhead return and the rest of the cennobites you have a new 'big bad' guy in the form of the head institution doctor whose obsession with the occult takes him into Pinhead's world and turns him into a beast of unspeakable terror. The blood and gore is probably twice that which was in the first film and that in itself is an impressive feat.Ashley Laurence returns as Kirsty Cotton, now institutionalized because of the events of the first film. While this isn't entirely a unique idea it is a solid staple into leading into a great horror film. Institutions always make great backdrops for horror flicks. Also returning in a superb manner is Clare Higgins who plays Kirsty's stepmother who has now been re-born much like her lover Frank was in the first film. Only now she wants vengeance on Kirsty. Higgins easily tops her original performance by becoming this monster, this twisted woman and creature and proves she is more than just a B-Movie actress which she sort of came off like in the first film. Higgins and Laurence have the perfect chemistry. Doug Bradley returns to his iconic role as Pinhead (again he is not called this in the film at all) and the best part of Hellraiser 2 is that we actually learn something about the man that 'Pinhead' was before he became the monster. This is of course explored in great depth later in the many, many sequels but it is delicately touched on in this film. Bradley is brilliant once again and manages to keep a lot of the mystery of his character which is a feat as well. Kenneth Cranham joins the cast as the head of the institution I mentioned earlier. He has a thirst for the occult and will stop at nothing to uncover the secret of the puzzle box. His doctor character is very campy but fits well in his scenes with Higgins but he truly flourishes as the latest cennobite that is blood thirsty and absolutely evil to the core. Imogen Boorman also joins the cast as a mute girl who is profoundly good at puzzles. The doctor is of course using her to try and solve the puzzle box. The problem with her character is that she starts out seeming almost autistic like there is something socially or mentally wrong with her but by the end of the film she seems to be fine other than she hadn't spoken since the death of her mother. Still she isn't in the film enough to make a huge impact.Tony Randel takes the helm from Clive Barker and I think that Barker must have had a significant hand in the film because it still has that distinct Barker quality and no offence to Mr. Randel but he doesn't exactly have an amazing career record especially at this time. The story falls short of what the original film was but that is bound to happen. Fortunately the characters and the incredible special effects and creatures win out again. The last half hour to 45 minutes of this film are terrifying, brilliantly filmed and breathtaking. A worthy follow up to the original film. And while as I said I don't believe it is as good as the original its too good to score it less than a solid 9/10.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
28,Pjtaylor-96-138044,What's your pleasure?,6,3 September 2021,"The best thing about 'Hellbound: Hellraiser II (1988)' is its music; Christopher Young's fantastic theme is still a stand-out in the genre. The second best things about it are the numerous flashback sequences (the picture begins with an abridged version of the prior title's finale and its key points are also recalled by the protagonist later in the film), which serve not only to refresh the audience's memory but also (quite accidentally, I'll add) to remind them how much better the first flick is than this one. The feature isn't bad but, as you can probably tell, it isn't a patch on its predecessor. That's primarily because, despite its arguably more ambitious plot and accompanying aesthetics, it's simply more straightforward and, thus, isn't as interesting. Where the first flick played on the duality between the different types of evil that its two antagonists (Frank and the Cenobites) represented, this one reduces all of its villainous players to almost cardboard cut-out versions of themselves and portrays them as these much more generic 'demons' than previously seen. This removal of nuance is one of the major reasons that the villains just aren't all that frightening. The one area in which they are developed actually reduces their enigmatic nature, in turn further reducing their scariness. At this point, the filmmakers still hadn't realised the potential that Pinhead (now credited as such) had to lead the franchise as its pinnacle of pain, so he and his Cenobite cronies have arguably even less screen time than they did in their previous outing. They're also, as I've mentioned, decidedly less disquieting. Their scenes, though atmospheric, lack any sense of menace and the fact that a large portion of the piece takes place in their domain without them present makes them seem far less important than they ought to. Other issues with the movie include a messy, even slightly repetitive plot and a couple of weak characters. Having said all that, it's not as though the experience is exactly bad or anything. Its positives include some decidedly disturbing, undeniably inventive visuals and a generally ambitious, otherworldly aesthetic that must have took some skill to pull off. It's visually interesting, that's for sure, and it has a few sequences which are quite entertaining in their own right. The picture is also well-paced and generally enjoyable, even if it isn't all that compelling. It isn't scary or thought-provoking, but it's a decent attempt at dark fantasy/horror that's as ambitious as it is uneven. 6/10.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
29,bowmanblue,One of the best horror sequels going,9,8 September 2017,"If you're considering watching 'Hellraiser 2: Hellbound' you should probably ask yourself if you're really into seeing skinless corpses ripping each other apart with hooks and chains. If this doesn't sound like something you'd observe over dinner then you should probably steer clear of any film with a man whose face is covered with pins is plastered all over the marketing. However, if you're one of those weirdos (and I include myself in that term!) who actually enjoyed the first 'Hellraiser' film and wants to explore that dark and depraved world a little more, then you can't go far wrong with the sequel.Yes, I know that sequels are usually inferior to the original and almost unheard of in horror terms for one to outdo its first incarnation. Now, I'm not saying that 'Part 2' is as shocking and original as 'Part 1,' simply because by definition it can't capture the shock value of witnessing the Cenobites for the first time. However, it does give more of what Hellraiser's audience wanted, plus it explores this terrible universe and expands on all the major themes from the original. And, for a sequel, that does kind of mean it ticks all boxes you'd want.Most of the original's cast return, we have the girl who survived the initial encounter with those flesh-hungry monsters, the Cenobites, Kirsty come back for more. Or rather she's been chucked in a mental institution due to repeated rants regarding how an escaped prisoner from hell seduced her stepmother into killing her father to satisfy demons who live in a puzzle box (to be fair, you can't blame the authorities for not believing her on that one!). And her torment isn't over, for, from the confines of her padded cell, she repeatedly sees images of her dead father, now trapped and skinless in hell and begging for help. However, it doesn't seem to just be her dad who's trying to get out of having their flesh torn from their body. Her wicked stepmother and sadistic doctor also have an interest in what secrets the puzzle box has in store. Enter the Cenobites.Again, 'Hellraiser 2: Hellbound' isn't for the faint-hearted. You need a strong stomach, as the film-makers seem to delight in coming up with new and varied ways to remove and violate body parts using a variety of sharp implements. I won't go into too much detail regarding the rest of the plot, but I will say that I actually prefer this one to the previous Hellraiser movie. This is because my one main criticism of the first film as that the Cenobites weren't in it enough. Here, however, they're back for good and in it for a much longer period of time – no bad thing when you see that practical make-up is a million times more disgusting than today's overused CGI gore. Overall, whether you prefer the first or the second, I think most horror-lovers will agree that this is at least a fair sequel to the original and they do go together well as a pair. The third instalment takes the franchise in a bit of a new direction and some felt that that was the point when it started to lose momentum. However, these two films go together well, so if you have a strong stomach, give them a go with the lights turned out.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
30,ericstevenson,Slightly better,7,26 December 2016,"It's hard to even qualify this as a slasher film seeing as how it's a lot more than just one character who does the killing. In fact, Pinhead barely directly kills anyone at all. It's more like a standard horror movie. Anyway, I was expecting to see more of Pinhead in this movie, but he may have had even less screen time than the original film. As far as slasher movies go, this wasn't bad at all. It has a bit too much exposition in the first half, but at the second half, it really does get better. We get our most creative parts here as we see Hell.I admit to not being the biggest fan of stop motion. I just think it sticks out pretty badly. The designs were still pretty creative with this. I like how it follows up directly with the first movie. You rarely see that in films like this. I do kind of like the characters and they get some fairly good development. It's still pretty confusing and too complicated. I wouldn't recommend this to someone who wasn't a fan of horror movies, but I would to someone who is. ***",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
31,CuriosityKilledShawn,The Harrowing of Hell,8,14 November 2017,"I don't know why it took me so long to invest in and review Hellraiser II. I've been a fan of Chris Young's score for years now but never actually seen the movie itself until now. Perhaps this is for the better, as I have a feeling that I would have misjudged this movie in my youth.Immediately after the events of the first movie Kirsty Cotton is institutionalised by the evil Dr. Channard. She's babbling about the Cenobites and the Lament Configuration and Channard not only believes her but has extensive research into the artefact and wants to see hell for himself. With the mattress that Julia died on in his possession he sacrifices one of his mentally ill patients to bring her back, albeit without her skin, in a brutally unpleasant scene that had me hiding behind the cushion. Soon, Julia is fully human again (and looking like a LOT like Emma Stone thanks to a far sexier haircut) and ready to grant him his morbid wish. Channard gives the Lament Configuration to Tiffany, a mute savant with a knack for solving puzzles. Pinhead and his cronies come forth, as expected, but allow Kirsty and Tiffany to run free in hell so they can stop Channard before he reaches the Leviathan, the unexplained (and probably inexplicable) God of Hell.While I did enjoy this movie a lot, it really does come across as an over-the-top mish-mash of The Dark Crystal, Labyrinth, and Dungeons and Dragons (all relatively new at the time). The script is a little hokier but still convincingly expands this mysterious universe. What I wasn't expecting, however, was how much I would like Pinhead.The image of this character is iconic and often used to sell, or perhaps oversell, the franchise. I didn't think I would be able to accept him a movie monster and it might be the reason why I kept this series at a distance for so long. But Pinhead is REALLY likable here. He's no hero, no villain, and nowhere in between, just an impartial observer who is as much a victim as the people he tears apart. Doug Bradley nails this character (haha) and his place in horror movie history is rightfully deserved.As I said, Chris Young's beautiful, operatic score is a leviathan in it's own right and some of his best work. I would argue that the first two Hellraiser movies have the best horror scores of all time and an absolute must-have for anyone who enjoys and appreciates good music.A sequel that falls short of the original in some ways but matches and exceeds it in others.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II

Hellbound is direct sequel to Hellraiser and, in my opinion, it's a bit better than the original. Opinions are divided about which one is better, but it is certain that the sequel is more complex, bloodier and, thanks to the success of the original, it had a much bigger budget. While in the first movie Cenobites introduced a hint of horror to our world, this time we join them on their field. Morbidly imaginative display of Hell that will forever be carved into your memory.

36,tomgillespie2002,A bit of a headache,4,22 December 2015,"Starting almost immediately after the climax of the first movie, Hellbound: Hellraiser II catches up with Kirsty Cotton (Ashley Lawrence), now being held in a mental institution after the horrors she witnessed. Her stories of a magical puzzle box and the gateway to hell are dismissed as fairy tales by her doctors and the police, all of whom believe her to be insane, apart from the shady Dr. Channard (Kenneth Cranham). Along with Channard's sympathetic assistant Kyle MacRae (William Hope), Kirsty discovers than Channard has be studying the world of the Cenobites for years, and is using a child in his institution with a skill for puzzles to open the Lament Configuration. Using the bloodied mattress stolen from the bloodbath at Kirsty's home, Channard inadvertently allows the re-birth of the demented Julia Cotton (Clare Higgins).Hellbound is a collection of decent ideas clumped together without much thought for coherency. The first Hellraiser had a sketchy mythology and left many things unexplained, but it compensated for this by conjuring a gripping and nightmarish tone throughout. Instead, Hellbound moves along at a frantic pace from one set-piece to another, without offering any kind of insight into just how a bloody mattress could work as a gateway through which Julia could escape the confines of hell, or why a child prodigy is required to open a box solves easily by Kirsty the first time around. With little character development or time to reflect on the events that occur, the film is a bit of a mess.Visually, it's quite stunning. We get to see more of the Cenobite world as Kirsty enters into hell and bumps into her old foe Uncle Frank (Sean Chapman), and although the sets occasionally appear a bit on the dodgy side, and with special effects and make-up encouraging more laughter than genuine terror, it manages to deliver some memorable imagery and wince-inducing gore when it is called for. Ultimately though, I found Hellbound to be a bit of a headache, and even the extended appearances of Pinhead (Doug Bradley) and his minions could not distract my attention enough to make me forgive the many narrative flaws. Perhaps it's because I love the first film so much, or maybe it's down to Clive Barker stepping out of the director's chair and being replaced by Tony Randel. Still, it's a damn masterpiece compared to the sequels that followed.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
37,Thanos_Alfie,Cenobites are back...,4,20 June 2020,"""Hellbound: Hellraiser II"" is a Thriller - Horror movie and the sequel of ""Hellraiser"", in which we watch Kirsty trying to understand what happened with his father and the death of her family while the Cenobites return once more.Since I had already watched the first movie I knew what I was about to watch and I had high expectations from this movie. I have to admit that ""Hellbound: Hellraiser II"" is a nice horror movie but not as good as the first movie because it did not have the same suspense or action with the first ""Hellraiser"". The direction which was made by Tony Randel was average and not as good as Clive Barker's who was the director of the first ""Hellraiser"" movie. Lastly, I have to say that the second ""Hellraiser"" movie is below average and I am sure that if you have already watched the first movie you will be disappointed by it.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
38,TheMovieDiorama,Hellbound: Hellraiser II recycles the same puzzling configurations whilst building upon its gory labyrinthine lore.,6,26 May 2020,"After commencing with an unnecessary brief recap of Kirsty's father's murder, an event that powered her motives in the original feature released just a year before this instalment, she is now admitted into a psychiatric hospital after continually reciting events of sadist Cenobites and their cultish leader Pinhead ""S&M-ing"" her house up with chains and blood. However, with Kirsty's father, uncle and stepmother all ripped apart, and the Lament Configuration missing, her only fear now is the freeing of a skinless Julia whose hardened blood still covers the mattress that she originally bled out on.Randel, with Barker as executive producer, merely replicate the exact same proceedings that occurred in the original film. An obsessed doctor brings home mentally ill patients so that Julia can stick her hand inside the back of their cranium and suck the juicy flesh right out of them. A predictable role reversal for her character, considering she was performing the same serial killer actions for her lover Frank. The doctor's assistant MacRae, a terrible performance from Hope who resembles a wet flannel, coincidentally sneaks into the house to witness the grotesque event before alarming Kirsty back at the hospital that everything is ""all true"". Anyway, moments later another patient, whom coincidentally adores solving puzzles, unlocks the Lament Configuration and the labyrinth-like world of the Cenobite dimension where the group encounter the God of hell, Leviathan.As a continuation of Barker's original feature, despite the fact that he himself wrote this story, it fails on almost every level. There's no narrative structure in place, but rather a series of gruesomely surreal deaths that hold minimal purpose to the grand outset of the Hellraiser lore. The regeneration of Julia, whom could've stayed trapped in hell, acting as a prime example of predictable plot replication to prevent Pinhead from being re-introduced too soon. In fact, the entire first half pandered to erratic expositional dialogue bolstered by deliciously cheesy acting that accumulated zero progression whatsoever.It's only when Tiffany unlocks the Lament Configuration, likening its unholy curse to Pandora's Box, that the story begins to interest. The Cenobite lore commences its intricate unraveling, adding indications to Pinhead's origin and Leviathan's transformative abilities, continuously excelling in detailed practical effects to depict this dimensional interpretation of hell. From robust wirework to stop-motion tentacle apparatus, the audacious deaths remain creative throughout and evoke the inner sadist within the viewer. Muscular skin suits draped in viscous blood provide inventive production and costume design, although closeup shots reveal the practicality of these suits, diminishing the ""movie magic"". Randel continually visits surreal imagery when Kirsty is navigating hell, supplying ominous dread whenever she precariously opens a door.Bold directorial choices, including the fate of Pinhead and his fellow chattering Cenobites, prove to incite uncertainty within the second half, bestowing much excitement and anticipation for the inevitable sequel. A sequel one hopes does not replicate the same plot structure again. However, overall, Hellraiser II remains an enjoyably bloody time that continues to pin its gory legacy on Pinhead himself. So, y'know, show me more of him next time!",Hellbound - Hellraiser II

Sadly, the Hellraiser, or should I say, the Pinhead franchise was spoiled by the contribution of a lot of bad to very bad movies.

40,Anonymous_Maxine,"Picking up almost exactly where part I left off, Hellraiser II, although also not a great movie in any respect, continues the unlikely but strangely fascinating story started by the original Hellraiser in 19",6,8 November 2000,"Hellraiser II, like the rest of the series, requires an extreme suspension of disbelief. Obviously, horror movies are not meant to portray reality, but there was not a single solitary piece of the real world presented here. Not for even one second of film time did anything resembling real life show up in the movie, and this took a lot away from the film's potential. Think about how much more effective the film would have been had Kirsty Cotton (Ashley Laurence, in her second ridiculous performance in this series alone) been kept in a psychiatric hospital that even remotely resembled even the most dismal hospital in the real world. I would have been much more interested had she been placed in an atmosphere of normality, beyond which she knows the hellish creatures that are the Cenobites lurk. I mean, a hospital that doesn't seem to have electricity, that has a violent ward that looks more like a medieval torture chamber, and that allows patients to roam the halls doesn't do justice to the film's personality. What this type of thing does is give the entire film a creepy mood, and takes away from the effectiveness of the parts of the film that are really meant to be scary. There just wasn't much creativity in the movie's presentation. Kirsty, a PATIENT in the hospital, wanders down the darkened hall one evening, and she comes upon the room of Tiffany who, as Kirsty's doctor explains to her after finding her (rather than taking her back to her own room), is a complete mystery because she never speaks. She just sits around and solves puzzles (like little wooden boxes!! Kirsty didn't seem bothered by that little detail). Also, did anybody ever figure out why the hell she touched the blood from her wall (`I am in Hell help me') to her LIPS?! Maybe she really does belong in the psych ward.Hellraiser II goes more in depth into some of the things that were presented in part I. For example, the film starts off with a quick scene showing Pinhead's creation, and the film also takes the audience into the world of the Cenobites. It gives an idea of where they come from and how they are made. It is this element of the film that saves it from absolute failure. The script was awful (`You have got to destroy that mattress! You have GOT to destroy that mattress!!' Or how about this, my favorite, `Kyle, when I think, I hurt.' That's brilliant, Kirsty), the atmosphere was entirely overdone, and the directing was unimaginative and routine. Kirsty and Kyle, her doctor,' momentarily develop a hint of a ridiculous romance, and the film was packed with careless mistakes (like the fact that, after Julia eats enough women to get her skin back, Dr. Channard cuts her bandages off and she has MAKEUP on. I guess it must have come with the skin). Then there were trivial things like when Ashley and Tiffany (whose real name we never learn), barely escape one of those Hell tunnels into a room and there are two beams of light showing on the wall, having come through the window. What's this, two suns? At any rate, the movie itself was clumsily put together, but luckily it went into detail about the things that made the equally poor original so successful. The Cenobites, ironically enough, are given a more human side, and even the thoroughly evil Pinhead shows a bit of compassion at the end of the film (a lot of good it does him). The best element of Hellraiser II, like part I, was the convincing makeup done on the skinless people. There were some intricate details there, and the desired gross-out reaction is pretty successfully attained. Some scenes were actually painful to watch (remember that poor nutcase who tried to get the maggots off himself with the straight razor?), which I think is a mark of at least limited success for this type of horror film. If you are a horror fan, the entire Hellraiser series is obviously mandatory viewing, but I think that other people, before you immediately dismiss the Hellraiser films as complete wastes of time, should realize that they are not meant to be mainstream films. These are made for people who are into this kind of splatter film, and as a splatter film it succeeds on many levels. It creates fascinating characters (the Cenobites, not the numbingly boring humans), tells an unlikely but interesting story about their interaction with the living world, and never fails to throw in buckets and buckets of blood and gore. I'm a pretty devoted horror fan myself, but even though I regard Pinhead as the best villain ever created in film, Hellraiser II (as well as the rest of them) was so flawed that I cannot hail this as a great or even a really good film. It's good horror and it's fun to watch, but it probably won't go down in history as a classic horror movie.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
41,videorama-759-859391,"Bloody funtastic hell, to raise your glass to",8,2 September 2015,"This is the bloodiest Hellraiser I've seen, where to me, this is an awesome sequel with a lot of blood spillages that are frequent throughout, where I recommend this one to any Hellraiser fan, especially if only viewing the original and loving it, where this one missed a cinema showing. I've seen 1, 3, and 5, but this one has a special place with me. To be honest, I don't find Pinhead one bit scary, but kind of annoying, played with such flawlessness by Doug Bradley. It's great when you have veteran actors, bring such nasty characters to life. We know them all, from the Freddy's, Jason's, Leatherfaces, oh yeah and Charlie from last years, Aussie shocker, Charlie's Farm. But also in this one, we have the two other evils return in the form of Julia and her such nasty half, Frank from the original Hellraiser. Continuing on, only hours from where the original ended, our poor lass Kirsty has awakened in a mental hospital, but taunted with the continual nightmare of yeah, HELL, thanks to that box, now in the hands of a young girl and mum patient, Tiffany, obsessed with it, if like a a rubix cube. Kirsty now is now seeing bloodshed, especially pools of it on mattresses. A young nice doctor, Kyle, who takes a warming to her, kind of believes Kirsty's story from the start, and when he's confronted by the evidence, the two team up to take the evil on themselves. Soon Julia, and last of all, Frank are back in the picture, with no love loss between them and Kirsty. Pinhead almost sides with Kirsty for a moment, and we so want this, as we learn Pinhead's real identity, and that wasn't born evil. It's really hard to see the point of the Hellraiser films, as if to just shock and entertain. But if this is really what HELL is like, when we die, not, god help us all.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
42,FiendishDramaturgy,"Beautiful, dark symphony of pain.",9,28 March 2004,"This is one of those rare occasions where the sequel is nearly as creative as the original. This one picks up where the first left off, seemingly seamlessly transporting us right back into the Realm of Pain, holding us by hooks embedded into our flesh, and forcing us to witness acts from which we normally would have turned and fled.This story is every bit as enjoyable as the first, and leaves us in fearful anticipation as for what is to come..The direction was inspired, the performances were realistic, the make-up artistry is a thing of pure art, the sets were believable, the characters were well developed and creatively constructed...all of which lends complete enjoyability to the finished product which is much more than the sum of its parts.Some critics have spoken lowly of these films, spewing forth the usual drivel concerning the over-use of blood, gore and mayhem. But I say that if that is all those critics see in these films, they are viewing them from behind their closed minds, rather than enlightened ones.There is dark substance, dire meaning and a hideous back-story behind these acts. They are not the senseless acts perpetrated in film after film of this time period in this genre. These films are constructed around a very solid premise.

43,dee.reid,"Horrifically beautiful, superior sequel to ""Hellraiser"" (1987)",9,19 January 2009,"""Hellbound: Hellraiser II,"" Tony Randel's superior blood-soaked follow-up to writer-director Clive Barker's 1987 ""Hellraiser,"" is by far one of the few cases in the horror genre of a sequel surpassing the original. I must admit that I wasn't looking forward to watching this movie initially, but I'm glad I did; I wasn't disappointed by this superior second installment.This second film in the ""Hellraiser"" series ups the ante in its blood-drenched delights and special effects, in addition to actually being quite scary. Most will make remarks about the extreme level of violence and gore in this film, but Randel is good in making sure it fits in with the relentlessly grim tone of the film and doesn't make it mindless schlock.The film takes place right after the events of ""Hellraiser"": young Kirsty Cotton (Ashley Laurence) was the sole survivor of that film (pre-credit flashbacks re-tell ""Hellraiser's"" story), and as ""Hellbound"" opens, Kirsty has been locked up inside a mental hospital and no one believes her claims about Juila (Clare Higgins), Frank (Sean Chapman), the Cenobites, and the puzzle box that opens up a gateway to a dimension of pain, suffering, and pleasure.An occult-obsessed doctor, Dr. Channard (Kenneth Cranham), believes her story and in his eternal desire for pleasure, he resurrects Julia and the two soon become lovers. However, Channard's naive young assistant Kyle (William Hope, of ""Aliens"") helps break Julia and a mute young girl named Tiffany (Imogen Boorman) out of the mental hospital. And in order to stop Channard, the newly resurrected Julia and the Cenobites, it's going to literally require a trip to the depths of Hell and back.""Hellbound: Hellraiser II"" doesn't play around in the gore department. Not even five minutes go by and we're treated to flesh being ripped apart by chains, hooks, and spikes. In these opening moments, we also learn of the horrific origins of Cenobite leader Pinhead (Doug Bradley). Like ""Hellraiser,"" the Cenobites are not your typical movie monsters. They are not your typical movie monsters because they are NOT the movie's main villains, and are only an element of the story (even though they figure much more prominently into this film's plot, and have greater depth, significance, and meaning in the story this time around). Like ""Hellraiser,"" Julia and Frank were the main villains in the film; here in ""Hellbound,"" Julia also returns as one primary antagonist, soon usurped by Dr. Channard.Even more amazingly, and unexpectedly, noteworthy of interest is the fact that here, the Cenobites become slight objects of sympathy, instead of horror - no longer the horrific creatures we've been led to believe that they actually are. Like Jeff Goldblum's character in ""The Fly"" (1986), the Cenobites are tragic beings because we come to see the men (and woman) they once were, although the effect works opposite because the emotional investments of pity and sympathy come AFTER they've torn someone's soul apart limb from limb.Author Clive Barker wrote the novel ""The Hellbound Heart"" from which these films are based. The man has a deeply rooted passion for blood, more blood, grisly horror, torture, razor-sharp objects, and just plain gruesome detail and excess. While I'm not sure exactly about his skills in writing dialogue, Randel does a good job of directing Peter Atkins's script while at the same time continuing Barker's first film, not repeating it, and he doesn't disappoint in terms of direction and horrific special effects (some of which was actually cut from the film so that it could be released with an ""R"" rating; an unrated version with all the violence and gore restored was recently released on DVD by Anchor Bay). The Atkins screenplay is confusing sometimes and tends to drag but once it gets going along, there's no turning back because your eyes are glued to the screen in absolute horror.Ashley Laurence remains the strong, courageous, and determined young heroine she created in ""Hellraiser"" as Kirsty Cotton. Certainly not your typical teenager ready to be torn apart limb from limb by some goon in a mask, she remains a steadfast and determined young woman who remains brave in the face of unspeakable evil. More remarkably, there's never a moment in this film when she just drops everything and strips for the males in the audience, even though she is involved in a nude-less shower sequence fairly early in the picture. Why hasn't she gotten more work as a result of her performance in this film, I ask?""Hellbound: Hellraiser II"" is a mostly superior second installment in a grisly franchise that quickly wore itself out with every subsequent sequel after this one.I'm glad I got the unrated DVD, with more skinless bodies, more ripped-apart flesh, and more ""suffering, sweet suffering.""9/10",Hellbound - Hellraiser II

45,Foreverisacastironmess123,Flesh for the inferno,10,22 October 2015,"In my view this is to Hellraiser what Aliens was to Alien. I think it's a sequel that's more than a classic in its own right and in scale at least, it outdoes the first film. It's also the sequel that is closest in tone and spirit to the original, which is something that seems to be unfairly disregarded about it. It has a very high amount of gore, with all the violence being shown directly rather than implied, which I reckon helps things immensely. It's very visually disturbing and graphic, with several great mad scenes and moments in it. The horrendous pit-like ""maintenence"" level of the asylum is a hell of man's own making, I find the rising pulse sound when Kirsty sees the apparition of what she believes is her dead father to be hair-raising, the scene of Julia's resurrection plays out like a little event that you don't really want to witness and is particularly full-on, the screams of the poor hallucinating mental patient bore right into you, and it's gotta be one of the most gruesome scenes in all horror cinema! There really is nothing more horrifying than watching human flesh be mutilated and damaged... I absolutely love the labyrinthine vision of hell, with its 'god' hovering over it in the form of an immense version of the puzzle, it's wondrously Gothic and foreboding. I like the idea of hell being a place that forces you to relive your darkest secrets and traumas, and scenes like the nightmare circus and when Kirsty sees the picture of her mother as well as the dark dimension beginning to spill over into the real world are strange and unsettling and it conveys the ominous feeling that good and evil, all of the characters are approaching the bottom of a descent into madness... Awesome chilling ending too, with the infernal pillar of souls and the face of the beast revealed. The locusts are a nice touch. Everyone in this does really well, Ashley Lawrence was great again as her beautiful feisty self, she and Imogen Boorman had good gal chemistry together and made for two great heroines. Boorman was fine, she was vital to the plot and all of that and had a lovely angelic quality of innocence to her that worked a lot more in her favour when she kept her gob shut.. The woman that played skinless Julia managed to give an eerily elegant and even alluring performance through her grotesquely amazing makeup effects. I never clicked on that it wasn't actually Claire Higgins, who was terrifically villainous in her role. Such a bitch, she was so good at making you despise her! Her trick of sucking the life out of unsuspecting victims with her fingernails was so vile. Great payoff for the character when she gets even with Frank by ripping out his still beating heart and holding it up to the fire! And what a legend of a character Hellraiser himself is, his every word is so commanding and magnetic, I'm totally compelled not to talk over any of his scenes! And even though they only contact with each other twice, I think it's enough that you get the feel of something between him and Kirsty, like a begrudging admiration of her spirit from him, as well as perhaps a desire for his soul to be set free? I love how the music swells so dramatically as he enters! Kenneth Cranham is excellent and quietly drives the events of the movie forward. When he's still just a man his coldblooded slaughter of human lives in his diabolical pursuit to know what lies beyond is horrific enough, but when he's transformed into an utterly insane cenobite who revels in his own viciousness and is constantly held aloft by a phallic thing and wields bizarre stigmata snakes that bloom into shifting instruments of murder, I just find the character to be terror incarnate and hideously creepy, I think he's one of the most genuinely nightmarish horror movie creations ever. I love all of his fun tacky medical-related punchlines! I think giving the guy a twisted sense of humour made him more scary. And he could only slaughter the cenobites like that because they were weak and expendable because of their newly awakened humanity. Disturbing, unsettling, scary and at times disgusting, this great horror film is always my pleasure, and I think this patient is finished!",Hellbound - Hellraiser II

If you think that's bad, her murdered father is in Hell, and signals to her that he needs her help. And if those two aren't bad enough, the psychiatrist assigned to her is, well, let's just say he has been dabbling in the black arts, and it isn't long before he brings the femme fatale from the previous film back to life, but as before, to make the full transition requires others to die.After this it all gets rather confusing, but if you like special effects and don't mind a bit of gore you might find it of some interest.

Director Tony Randel's sequel keeps up the terrifying atmosphere and genuinely infernal creepiness of its predecessor and is even considerably gorier than the (also very gruesome) original. This second entry to the ""Hellraiser"" franchise epitomizes pure Horror as its predecessor and takes the viewer on a terrifying journey into the pits of a Hell from the mind of Clive Barker.The film starts off pretty much where the first part ended. After the horrifying events that took place in part one, survivor Kristy Cotton (Ashley Laurence) awakes in a mental hospital. One might think that psychiatrists are not eager to believe stories about Cenobites, demons from a bizarre, sadomasochistic Hell. The head of the institution, Dr. Channard (Kenneth Cranham), however, is obsessed with occultism and has his own plans with his new cognitions about cenobites and resurrection from Hell...***Warning! BIG SPOILERS Ahead!*** Kristy's evil stepmother Julia (Clare Higgins) returns from Hell, and she is not the only one. So do the Cenobites. The cenobites, especially the iconic Lead Cenobite (commonly referred to as 'Pinhead', played by Doug Bradley) are some of the most terrifying creatures the World of Horror has ever brought forth. My only slight complaint about ""Hellbound"" is the manner of how the cenobites are humanized towards the end. It seems to be a common assumption among makers of Horror-sequels, that they somehow need to explain how monsters became monsters - which is not always a good idea, in my opinion. Ever since I first saw the first two Hellraiser parts many years ago, I have held the view that the Cenobites were most terrifying in the first part, when they were still utterly mysterious and their origin was not yet explained. This minor fault is not yet extreme in this second part, however, and it does not waste its status as a fascinating sequel. The visions of Hell are extremely creepy and terrifying and character actor Kenneth Channard brings in a new type of purely evil villain. The sequel is, once again, filmed excellently, the settings are sublime and the gore-effects are as gruesome as it gets. Overall, ""Hellbound"" is an extraordinary sequel that must not be missed by Horror fans. After this, the series spiraled downwards. My rating: 8.5/10",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
48,a_chinn,"Worthy sequel is not equal to the original film, but still well worth watching",6,1 August 2018,"Best of the many (and mostly bad) sequels to Clive Barker's original film. This was also the last of the Hellriaser films that Barker had a significant hand in the creative process, staying on to write the story as well as producing. I remember watching this film way back in the day when it first came out on VHS and the one scene that had burned itself into my memory was still as horrifying now as it was then. This sequel picks up right after the events of the first film, with Kristy being brought to a mental institution after the death of her dad and stepmom after encountering Pinhead and the Cenobites (not a boy band). Unbeknownst to Kristy, the head doctor of the hospital, an excellent Kenneth Cranham as Dr. Channard, is darkly interested in the occult and has been searching for the Lament Configuration for years. He listens to Kristy's account of what happened to her and instead of destroying the bloody mattress she's pleaded with him to destroy, he decides he wants to resurrect Kristy's evil stepmother, Julia. As with the first film, a resurrection requires massive amounts of blood for a body to reform, which brings us to the aforementioned horrific scenes that was burned into my teenage memory. In order to resurrect Julia, Dr. Channard takes one of his mentally ill patients who believes he has bugs crawling all over his body and who has to wear a straight-jacket at all times to prevent digging at himself, places the patient on the mattress, removes his straight-jacket, and hands him a straight razor to slice at his imagined bugs crawling over his skin. That scene was just as unsettling now as it was 30 years ago, which is saying something in a post Takashi Miike and ""Hostel"" horror film world. Beyond that one shocking scene, the story involves Channard seeking the Hellraiser puzzle box and Kristy tying to again escape Channard, Pinhead, the other Cenobites, and hell itself. Without spoiling anything, this film reveals more about the Cenobites history and origin, which is interesting and also feels canon since Barker was part of the story (more was told in the subsequent sequel, but Barker had little to no part in those films). Although his film lacks the interesting visual style Barker brought to the first film, with it's dichotomy of beauty and blood, director Tony Randal does and effective job of building suspense, horror, and a fair amount of visual style to the film. Similar to the first film, both good and bad, the gory practical special effects are top notch and wonderfully (and horrifically) executed, but the other special effects look like they were done with Magic Marker. The super imposed images of Hell are visually striking, but not even close to looking as if the characters are really in this location (it's super fakey looking). Despite those shortcomings and although ""Hellbound: Hellraiser II"" is not a classic horror film, it is a worthy sequel to the original Clive Barker classic. On a side note, rewatching this film mostly made me wish that Barker can somehow regain the film rights to his creating and have the opportunity to reboot the franchise, just as James Cameron is getting to do with his Terminator franchise.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
49,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Has what it needed to succeed but lost so much,6,28 May 2013,"Clive Barker's directional debut with his novel adapted film, Hellraiser (1987), became an instant classic to many. The story had significant depth, its characters felt real, thanks to great acting, the effects for its time were astounding and its music was hauntingly beautiful. So it is no surprise that when a sequel would be made to this favored horror film, fans would expect a product containing the same or better in magnitude. I am one of those fans, but unfortunately, that promise wasn't upheld to the highest degree. It is not to say that the movie is awful, but it had so much going for it and yet it failed to be anywhere close to its predecessor.What really misses the mark and is also the key component to making a good movie, is a story. The story, which was written by Barker and adapted to the film by Peter Atkins lacks a strong sense of story telling. The screenplay will attempt to bring up various subplots but never accesses them fully. For example, this installment provides viewers with the possibility of understanding the older characters better, and, being introduced to new characters. However both are never explained in a clear way or even resolved. It's actually hard to say what the plot was about and who the main villain was either.After seeing the murder of her whole family, Kirsty Cotton (Ashley Laurence) finds herself in a hospital with everyone against her. She tries to explain herself but nobody believes her. Little does she realize that she will prove herself right when the Doctor in charge of the hospital turns out to be as wicked as her evil stepmother Julia and Uncle Frank by unleashing the Cenobites from the lament configuration once again. To do this, the doctor will have a mute girl (Imogen Boorman) open the box because she has a knack for solving puzzles.However, this doesn't tell me anything. It is never completely explained to why Doctor Channard (Kenneth Cranham) wants to open the portal to hell. In the movie, viewers will learn he's been studying the lament configuration for years but it's never said what he was searching for. It is also never fully explained to why this girl is mute and what happened to her family. The mother of the girl is shown a few times but never bothers to show the end result of her. What gives? At least Atkins wrote a more decent back-story to the Cenobite characters (thanks to Barker's input). But the rest is never finished. It's frustrating.On the other hand, I do give credit to the casting department for bringing back majority of the cast. It's great to see Ashley Laurence again as well as Clare Higgins, Sean Chapman and of course Doug Bradley. I also enjoyed the set design to the labyrinth of hell. I for one would get lost very easily in such a place. The imagery was creepy and disturbing as always too. I still get goosebumps from a crying child; very unsettling. Adding to that was Christopher Young's film score (who also did the previous film) which made it more effective. Although I found Young's score from the previous film more compelling, I was happy to see that he stuck with his original theme and even built on a few other tunes. Lastly, the make-up department and special effects crew also did a great job. From the Cenobite transformations, gore, creature effects to the skinless characters is still an amazing feat for 1988. I'm just baffled to how incoherent the screenplay puts all these great things together into an almost unenjoyable mess.Peter Atkins' screenplay digs into some really interesting ideas and character arcs but never comes close to finishing a single one. It is even more frustrating because this sequel contains the majority of the previous cast, the same composer and the same gruesome imagery.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
50,p-stepien,Gore awoken,5,9 January 2010,"A sequel to the much lauded, albeit slightly overrated Hellraiser (1987). This second attempt to delve into the mythology of the Celobites is very much a hit and miss dash to make a movie trying to milk the success of the original. With what feels like a quick-made script you have the simple things done right - the look of the Celobite realm, the gore, the special effects are all incredible even after all these years. Unfortunately the weak point is the lore itself.The first part left wanting for more of the dark myths connected with Pinhead and his comrades. Hellbound adequately noted the need, but failed on delivery, as the world of the Celobites and the logic that rules it seems chaotic and at best patchy... basically whatever is needed for the storyline happens, so actions of both characters as well as demons are devoid of any serious thought on the side of the scriptwriter. Basically it lacks the thing that made i.e. Nightmare on Elm Street click so nicely - a rulebook for evil.In the end a mildly satisfying experience that leaves you wanting for some more substance that would help characterize the evil much better.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
51,lemon_magic,"Wildly uneven and almost incoherent sequel, but pulled together by haunting imagery and an intriguing back story",6,3 September 2005,"""Hellraiser IV: Bloodline"" has been playing in fairly heavy rotation on digital cable lately, and while I felt it was the weakest film or the franchise (not counting the direct-to-DVD sequels), something about it made me want to go back and look at the 2nd film in the series, ""Hellbound"". So I recently picked up a reissued DVD of it and sat down for a look, to see if it was as visceral and interesting as I remembered. I agree with Clive Barker's summary of this work (in a bonus featurette included with the DVD): Hellraiser II is an an uneven movie, but that it still has some very strong story and design elements, and some very effective acting and directing. It's not perfect, and it's not quite as well put together as the original, but there is plenty to like about it (if gruesome horror is your cuppa tea). Here's what I think is the strength of the franchise (or it was until the later filmmakers ran it into the ground and turned it into a kind of ""Twilight Zone with meat-hooks""): along with some striking character designs and some cool SFX, the Hellraiser story managed to maintain a unique emotional feel and theme. It re-imagined the sufferings of damnation and torment in a vivid, memorable way that replaced Hellfire with Impalement and Cutting. It started out as a tale of a severely dysfunctional family, became the tale of a dysfunctional family's entanglement with Hell (re-imagined in a very compelling way), and then turned into the story of the principle denizen of that Hell and his attempts to invade our world to inflict his visions on us...but all of these versions of the story have been powered by the visceral dread of and fascination with, the spectacle of impalement and cutting...and the emotional consequences of it. The most interesting part of ""H II"" to me was the actual glimpse of the 'underverse'/dimension/version of Hell that spawned Pinhead and the Cenobites and the further exploration of their natures and origins. Even after 15 years, this envisioning of hell as an endless Labyrinth still has the power to fascinate...even if the 'modern eye', grown sophisticated from hours of multi-million dollar CGI, can now easily see matte paintings and process shots. It is still interesting and evocative enough that it helps the viewer overlook some of the more overblown and badly told portions of the movie, and once more 'get into' the mood Barker was trying to convey in the original. At the same time, what is revealed to the viewer doesn't really hang together, and tends to offend his desire for a consistent, coherent chain of cause-and-effect. It leaves a LOT of questions unanswered, or answered unsatisfactorily (although it is entirely possible that some of these answers were lost due to editing decisions). For instance: Why doesn't Pinhead 'know' about Julia and Channard's entrance into Hell and Chennard's subsequent transformation? How does Channard get the power to so easily defeat the Cenobites? Why are some people turned into Cenobites (like the soldier who becomes Pinhead) and others are simply condemned to suffer (like Kristy's father and his brother Frank). Why does Julia's allegiance to ""Leviathan"" differ from Pinhead's (who seems to be the premier soldier of Hell?). Why isn't she working with him to accomplish Leviathan's aims? For that matter, why is Kristy in a sanitarium after the events of the first film, when her boyfriend is sent home with no ill effects after going through the same experiences? Etc. All these answers can be found by people willing to further investigate the back-story (such as www. cenobite.com), but they are not especially evident within the movie itself, and that feeling of incompleteness and information-glossed-over, weakens the film experience quite a bit. (By comparison, Star Wars IV, ""A New Hope"" has an enormous back-story, but you don't need to know it to understand the events of the film or the logic of the movie's plot). I feel there is really no need to get into the worth of the acting here - everyone here is at least perfectly adequate to the material, some of the actors are great, and everyone is as good as they need to be for a gruesome damage-fest like this. No one is here to win an Oscar - everyone is here for the paycheck. But they are all pros (even the oft maligned Ashley Laurence), and they get the job done. Everyone here is a pleasure to watch, in costume or out of it. So is it a 'classic' of modern horror? Hmmm. I'd say, no. But it IS a piece that holds up well, and still has a certain power and fascination to it even more than an decade after the fact. That's more than they will be able to say about ""Final Destination 2"" (which I actually liked), or ""Jeepers Creepers 2"", or the Jason or Freddy Kreuger series.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
52,vengeance20,Decent Sequel to the Decent Original,4,3 November 2016,"Remembered bits & pieces of this film from seeing it 3 years ago, though it wasn't iconic enough as there was parts I forgot about.The story continues where the daughter finds herself with the battle against the cenobites once again in this sequel to the original. This time round, the doctor, head of the asylum that the daughter is getting treated at resurrects the daughters mum Julie from the bloody mattress which she was killed & laid to rest on in the previous film. The doctor then begins to get her women to make her strong again! This time the daughter & another inmate called Tiffany help destroy her & the cenobites once again in this sequel. Just like the first, I liked the blood & gore effects, not to mention the visuals used as for a film of it's time in 1989, was decent, considering what they had to work with. Though also like the first, it was dated & just didn't have much meatiness in it for me to start watching again. Though the actress (the gorgeous one) done well in this film as with many of the others including Doug Bradley himself, I just felt this film dragged & had a bit of a samey story-line to the first, which didn't bother me but I felt it could've been shorter & a bit more with it. But it was decent overall.The story-line to be a sort of ""mirror image"" to the first wasn't so bad & I in fact found it easy to follow the second time as with the first but it does get confusing as to whats happening & why everything is what it is in the film.I overall would give this a 4.5/10 It says 4 but I give it 4.5, a half slashed rating of what I gave the first one which was a 5/10.

It is most unfortunate, however, the young puzzle solver ( Imogene Boorman ) is so awful in her role that it becomes distracting, not to mention that I spent most of her scenes wondering if the role was being played by a real girl, or an androgynous guy?Pinhead and his Cenobites are still gruesome and ghoulish, simultaneously frightening, and also what keeps most watching, but the depiction of Hell is only a mixed bag. Hell is shown here as a labyrinthine series of concrete hallways, dusty, seemingly endless, like we're just wandering through a castle. Some shots of it are convincing, and look good, while in other scenes, it's clearly just painted backdrops.Claire Higgins, as Julia, is an evil creature, cold and ruthless.

55,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Hellbound: Hellraiser II""- A curiously strong horror sequel.",8,1 December 2016,"On the whole, Clive Barker's ""Hellraiser"" has become one of the more head-scratching film franchises in recent memory, thanks to the wild and crazed range in quality of the films themselves. What once started as perhaps the most promising and rewarding new franchises quickly took a nose-dive in quality with the bizarrely dated and amusingly cheesy third and fourth entries. And since then, starting with the admittedly very decent fifth film, all future follow-ups skipped theaters and hit the shelves as direct-to-video releases... being plagued with lowered budgets and lowered expectations with each new chapter. But before it's all too soon downfall into near-oblivion, there was one very fascinating and completely fulfilling follow-up in the series that took audiences by storm and showed just what a properly-realized sequel was capable of. And that of course was ""Hellbound: Hellraiser II.""Directed by Tony Randall from a screenplay by Peter Atkins and a story treatment by series creator Barker, ""Hellbound"" is a curiously strong horror sequel that builds on the foundation of the original, further developing previously established characters and concepts in a near-ideal fashion and fleshing out the backstory in startling new ways. Barker's original, while relatively self-contained, did plant some questions in the backs of viewer's minds regarding the rules and history of the devilish world he built, and ""Hellbound"" expands on these in a wonderfully organic fashion. And though it may never quite match the ferocious originality of that first film, it comes darned close and stands tall as a very good sequel to an iconic original.Set almost immediately after the heart-stopping finale of ""Hellraiser"", we pick up with protagonist Kirsty Cotton (Ashley Laurence) as she is admitted into a mental institution due to the trauma she experienced. Soon haunted by visions of her father's skinned and agonized remains, she deduces that he is stuck in Hell, and that she must try and find a way to save him. At the same time, Dr. Channard (Kenneth Cranham), the devious head of the hospital has secretly acquired the mattress upon which Kirsty's step-mother Julia (Clare Higgins) died, and brings her back through a disturbing sacrifice of blood. Obsessed with the puzzle-box and the cenobites, Channard is seduced by Julia, who manipulates him into using one of his patients- the brilliant but mute puzzle-solver Tiffany (Imogen Boorman)- to open the gateway to Hell once again. And thus, the stage is set, as all of our characters enter Hell itself for their own reasons...The film is a bold exercise in atmosphere and pure dread, with wonderfully disturbing visual direction and some strong and well- established characters. Randel's direction is remarkable, and his keen eye for composition and flow helps create and ever- rising sense of tension and fear, which perfectly compliments the tight yet larger-scoped script by Atkins. From the dreaded return of the cenobites (lead of course by the brilliant Doug Bradley as ""Pinhead"") to the disturbing realization of Hell itself, the film is constantly upping the ante when it comes to pure horror. It's also even occasionally surprises with moments of true emotional and a few of the twists and turns it takes come completely unexpected in the best of ways.The cast is just wonderful. Ashley Laurence grows tremendously as a performer this time around and does a very decent job as a likable protagonist. Clare Higgins is as devious and deadly as ever, and seems to be having an absolute blast chewing the scenery in her villainous role. Kenneth Cranham and Imogen Boorman round out our human cast nicely in their supporting roles, both doing great jobs with the material. And as always, the cenobites are played to perfection. Doug Bradley is an absolute joy as the pure evil that is Pinhead, and it's nice to see him given an expanded role, especially one that even offers glimpses of the man Pinhead was before he journeyed into Hell.While the film does occasionally suffer a misstep here and there due to some problems with the wonky pacing and some questionable scenes that felt like they were thrown in without much thought or deliberation, I find ""Hellbound"" to be a completely entertaining, engrossing and atmospherically frightening follow-up in the best of ways. It's not a perfect film, and it can be a bit uneven, but it does a great job continuing the story so deliciously crafted by Barker in the original, and it emerges as one of my personal favorite horror sequels as a result.And so, I give ""Hellbound: Hellraiser II"" a very good 8 out of 10 as a fan of horror.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
56,udar55,"Goes to hell when they, uh, go to hell",6,8 February 2006,"Released just over a year after the original, HELLRAISER II picks up right where the last one ended. But with Clive Barker releasing a majority of creative control (he still receives a ""story by"" credit) to screenwriter friend Pete Atkins and first time director Tony Randel, the end result is a film that faithfully echoes Barker's earlier work yet also undermines it.The film's biggest problem is the script which relies too much on coincidence. For example, new character Dr. Channard has a deep and previously existing interest in the Lament Configuration. And Kirsty's neighbor in the mental ward just happens to be a mute girl who is really good at solving puzzles. Things like this exist solely to move the plot from point A to B and so on, something the original HELLRAISER lacked in its confined dysfunctional family storyline. To Atkin's credit, the script does effectively introduce the back story of Pinhead and features some appropriately bleak dialogue (including perhaps the series best line: ""Your suffering will be legendary, even in hell."").In their attempt to deliver something bigger and better than the original, the filmmakers further damage themselves when it comes to Kirsty's adversaries. The sequel has two great foes for Kirsty to battle  Julia and Pinhead  but the script makes them secondary and shifts the focus to the ridiculous Dr. Channard. While in human form he is a fearsome villain but once he becomes a Cenobite, all that goes out the window in favor of a guy who delivers one liners (""The Doctorisin!""). At this point in the series, even Pinhead hadn't sunk that low. On top of all that, Atkins actually has the Cenobite Channard dispatch the lead Cenobites in a battle that is so trivializing that it makes you wonder why anyone feared these guys in the first place.Tony Randel handles the film well visually with his two best sequences taking place in hell. One is when mute Tiffany experiences her own surreal vision of hell that includes everything from deranged clowns to a clever giallo tribute. The other is when Kirsty confronts her Uncle Frank in a fiery tomb housing floating slabs that carry moaning, bloody bodies. These visions of hell are certainly unique to the film world but ultimately the film doesn't have the budget to properly convey this. Instead of a sweeping landscape, we get characters traveling what seems to be the same tunnel over and over and a few MC Escher style matte paintings. Most disappointing is the unveiling of Leviathan as an amorphous black blur emitting from a large version of the box.Outside of those uneven effects, the rest of the film's effects work is really well done. Bob Keen and his crew return from the original film and deliver an abundant amount of blood, making sure that the standard of delivering cinematic images beyond belief continues. The bloody resurrection of Julia and the transformation of Dr. Channard are the film's FX highlights. Obviously the unrated version is the way to go. In addition to these striking images, HELLBOUND contains the world's first male/skinless female kiss.And for a film with such taboo images, it features some consistently great acting. Lead Ashley Laurence (was she really in her teens when this was filmed) is actually better than she was in the first film. New faces Kenneth Cranham and William Hope are both good as the bad doctor and good doctor respectively. Doug Bradley, graduating from ""Lead Cenobite"" to a full fledged Pinhead, maintains his wicked demeanor as a hell's no. 1 agent while projecting the right amount of emotion when reminded of his human form. However, if HELLRAISER II truly belongs to anyone, it is Claire Higgins as the evil stepmother Julia Cotton. With a cold manner dipped in extra bitchy-ness, Higgins is almost too good for the proceedings.New World's efforts for the low budget follow up paid off with the film earning just under ($12 million) what the original grossed ($14.5 million). Sadly, the next time Pinhead and his brethren appeared on screen, they were firmly in the claws of Miramx's Dimension line. This move resulted in a succession of sequels that, while passable, moved the series further away from Clive Barker's groundbreaking original.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II

59,Stephen_A_Abell,A Dark And Nasty Horror Fantasy...,7,7 March 2018,"One of the best things about this film is its continuation from the first. Dr Channard (Cranham) takes an interest in Kirsty (Laurence) after she's institutionalised after her family's slaughter. However, Dr Channard has darker ulterior motives as he also has an interest in the L'Merchant Configuration. Taking possession of the mattress where Julia (Higgins) was murdered, he begins to bring her back from her torture in hell. He also has a genius puzzle solver in his asylum... a mute girl called Tiffany...This is a horror film that verges on a dark fantasy, which is especially evident in the scene where Tiffany is opening the box. What with the musical score and the atmospheric colours pulsing, it gave the film a much different feel to other horror flicks of the time. There's more than a feel of Argento here. I think it's this reason we didn't really enjoy or appreciate it at the time. However, watching it again has been very enjoyable. There's a lot to like about this film. It's packed full of atmosphere, though it's not always horror or fear. There are lots of iconic shots, such as a newly reborn and skinless Julia in her white suit, smeared with blood... Dr Channard undergoing his transformation... and the labyrinth itself. Even the acting is stronger this time around, as Laurence, Higgins, and Chapman who resume their roles from the original film, appear more comfortable in their roles. Then there's Cranham, who is a wonderful actor, he can do nothing but add strength to the cast. Of course, there's Bradley who is Pinhead - there can be only one. He was the strongest actor in the original, and thanks to his delivery of the best lines in the script and his skill to be ominous and scary... just by being there, he still stands out in the sequel.There are some things that just don't work. One of which is the guardian of the labyrinth, the Leviathan. Which is just a revolving piece of metal that casts out a dark light over its dominion? We then learn that the end transformation of the L'Merchant cube is a miniature Leviathan... This may have worked better had the mini-L been able to create dark thoughts in peoples minds... or to create hellish scenes. But this and the subsequent ending is a little weak. It was nice though that they decided to reduce the number of light effects in this film, which made it a little stronger. I didn't even mind the energy bolts shooting through the labyrinth at the end. However, the stop-motion animation does look a little dated today, but what else were they supposed to do(?) The new Cenobite has some special skills and there was no CGI at that time which would do it justice.This is a big film with big ideas. Unfortunately, at that time they were really restricted by budget, means, and running time. This film should have been at least another half an hour longer... maybe an hour... to do the story justice and to help build up a couple of characters a little more, like Tiffany and Kyle (Hope), and to stretch out the ending as it feels rushed to fit the 90minute runtime, which most horror flicks of the '80's & '90's rigidly stuck too.That said, this is a superior horror flick to the majority of the fodder being created today. This kicks arse in imagination, story concept, scale, direction, and acting. So if you are wanting a classic horror to watch then the Hellraiser movies are worth a viewing or three.I would recommend this to all lovers of the dark and nasty.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II

The influence of gaming gets even worse in some of the later sequels. The front end of the film could have used more careful exposition, but it did move right along.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
61,hnt_dnl,Such randomness,1,1 November 2021,"During my binge watching of popular horror franchises in Halloween month, it was the Hellraiser movies' turn in my queue. I watched the first iconic film from 1987, really liked it, then read somewhere some people saying the second movie is even better. That couldn't be any further from the truth! LOL The second film HELLBOUND:HELLRAISER 2 (1988) is one of the most random nonsense horror movies I've ever watched. Barely anything made sense in this. The first movie is currently at 7.0 while this sequel is at 6.5 and even though it is rightfully ranked lower, that rating is still too high.The first strike against this movie is that NOTHING happens for the first 30 minutes. The first half hour is a literal recap of the events of the first film. The second problem is the return of Kirsty (dubiously played by Ashley Laurence), my least favorite part from the first film, as the protagonist. She was basically the cliche teen final girl in that one, then somehow even though this movie picks up immediately after the first movie left off, she looks way different and is all of a sudden in her late 20s, probably the actress' actual age. Laurence's acting is awful in these movies, shouting all her lines with zero emotion or inflection. A better actress could have made this character bearable.Next, there are so many head-scratching moments and plot holes. Why would Kirsty even believe that her Larry was in Hell to begin with? This man was a great father and loving husband to both his wives. And even still, if he's in Hell, then how does Kirsty think she can pull him out of there? He's dead, so he'd just come back like Frank did in the first movie as bloody skeletal demon without skin. While Julia (an even hotter looking Clare Higgins) makes a welcome return in this sequel, I didn't understand her motives. First, why didn't she just kill Kirsty when she had her dead to rights at the film's halfway mark? This is Julia's sworn enemy who is out to thwart her plans. Why leave her to cause more trouble? Also Uncle Frank returns and it's less welcome as for some reason this sicko is obsessed with eternally getting it on with his niece! How does Frank, who lured Kirsty into his lair, not have an actual plan? She just rolls in, throws some sheet over his belongings, then he reverts to a bloody skeleton again. Huh?Then there's the subplot of this Evil Doctor character who purposely revives Julia because he wants a guide to Hell and recruits the mute blonde patient Tiffany to unlock Pandora's box to open the portal. Since he WANTED to be there, why is Julia acting like she's double-crossing him? Why did the Doc and Julia just leave the girl behind with the box, which was yet again picked up by Kirsty, who they should have done away with anyway? How did Julia, who is basically a minion of Hell, equally susceptible in the dimension as the still human Kirsty and Tiffany? One minute, she's walking normally through the windstorm in the dimension, the next Kirsty does another plot armor trick and Julia needs to hang on just like the 2 human girls. Frank and Julia are on their home field and somehow the visiting team knows their turf better than them.Then there's Pinhead and his cohorts. I thought this character was supposed to be the cool antagonist, but he's barely in the first 2 movies. To get them on her side, Julia tells Pinhead and Company they used to be human and I was like so what? They should already KNOW this. Frank and Julia were human once and they still know of the world. Plus, they shouldn't even care anymore as they've accepted their fates. This Kirsty character is the definition of plot armor, just doing and saying random stuff that always magically thwarts the bad guys, yet none of it makes sense. No wonder I've never heard anyone talk about this girl in the lore of film final girls.Why did Tiffany decide to start speaking at the most odd, random moment? I was expecting a shock value moment to bring her out of her shell, but she just decides to start talking. Why is the Doctor getting distracted by Julia after for years he's planned this journey to open the gateway and control the hellidh dimension? Julia bats her eyelashes and he's hot all of a sudden when he was low-key repulsed by her before and only used her. Plus, it wasn't Julia of course but our plot-armored final girl Kirsty! This sequel is full of random scenes stitched together and the writers called it a movie.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
62,mattymatt4ever,"Horrible, and not in a good way",4,21 April 2003,"The original ""Hellraiser"" had its flaws, but overall it worked. ""Hellbound"" is an utter disaster, which may only appeal to the absolute biggest fans of the ""Hellrasier"" series.  The story is not the least bit interesting, and lost me about halfway through.  If this were a film I really cared about, I'd burn as many brain cells as possible to make sense of it, but this clunker wasn't worth the effort.  The savvy gore f/x are still there, but that alone can't save this wreck.  Sequels are supposed to shed more light on its predecessor, and this shed very little light.  So we see Pinhead out of his makeup, as a human being.  Big deal!  The script even resorts to such cliched characters as the crazy girl, who's locked away in an asylum, doesn't talk to anyone and possesses the one power that can save the characters from eternal damnation.  And as if this wasn't unpleasant enough to sit through, there's a disgustingly graphic scene in which a crazed mental patient scrapes maggots off his body with a razor blade, slicing himself left and right.  I'm pretty jaded when it comes to violence on film, but I don't have a strong enough stomach to endure a scene of that nature. I guess it's because I react most negatively to violence I can relate to. I would never know what it feels like to be decapitated with a chainsaw, but I know what it feels like to cut myself with a razor.  It's not something I do regularly, but I know the feeling.  As I said before, hardcore ""Hellraiser"" fans may find merit in this sequel, but as for others--BEWARE!!!My score:  4 (out of 10)",Hellbound - Hellraiser II

64,fmarkland32,Hell is a place on earth...,7,6 September 2006,"Minutes after the thrilling conclusion of Hellraiser we find Kirsty Cotton (Ashley Laurence) in a hospital where she is trying to live down the trauma that she had just faced. (One that includes not only having Andrew Robinson as a dad but also seeing her uncle wear his flesh and try to rape her, there is an ""Aristocrat joke"" in the making for that one) Anyway it seems that hell is all around us and her father is begging her to save him from the depths of hell. Kirsty tries to do so but this time she has to do battle with her evil stepmother (Clare Higgons) who labels herself as the wicked queen. This is all brought together in a plot that was hard to follow but remained interesting enough for me due to mood and tons of gore. Hellbound:Hellraiser II is one of those movies that leaves your brain numb after watching it. There are sequences of such nastiness that even I had to flinch a couple times (And I live and die by the genre of Horror) As usual it is the cast that provides interesting characters. Ashley Laurence was always an underrated talent and gives a great performance which centers the film. Clare Higgins works in the role but she lacks the edge she had in the first and her motivation seems rather random this time. Indeed that is the feeling through out. It is pure randomness that often times leaves the viewer unsure of what is going on at times. It makes enough sense that you get the gist of it but they're some loose ends which basically leave one scratching their heads. Where as I can't understand Roger Ebert's disdain for the original, I can see where he is coming from on the sequel as Hellbound:Hellraiser II has no real plot or story and it consists of only gore effects. The movie also has a sense of crowdedness as if Tony Randel is so busy with so many things at once he can't balance them all and in the end it becomes a flaw. Still as it goes, Hellbound:Hellraiser II is far superior to most slice and dice thrillers from the 80's.* * * out of 4-(Good)",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
65,meddlecore,Not-So Brazil - A Bad Trip...To Hell: The Katabasis Of Kristy & The Origin Of The Cenobites,7,12 October 2021,"Hellbound: Hellraiser 2 begins with Kirsty (Ashley Laurence) waking up in a hospital, after having survived the ordeal from the first film.The doctors believe she is suffering from ptsd, after witnessing her family being murdered...and don't give much credence to her claims...thinking she has lost her mind.The main doctor dismisses her calls to destroy the mattress that Julia died on...knowing that it will allow her to come back to life, like Frank (i'm pretty sure they say Ray in the film) did in the previous film.Her only hope to prove her sanity is a young doctor, who is intrigued by her story- and probably crushing on her a little.It's through his investigation that he discovers the doctor at the helm of the asylum is, himself, a sadistic madman- who, not only, encourages and enables his patients to torture themselves (as part of the ritual to revive those who've been taken to hell via the powers of the puzzle box)...but is also obsessed with the puzzle box Kirsty has been rambling on about...and seems to be sacrificing the mental patients to whatever it is he just spawned from hell.So he starts to think she might be telling the truth...The first 20-odd minutes of this film are essentially a re-cap of happenings from the first film (in the context of her telling her story to the police and doctors).And, the introductory torture/reincarnation scene is super cringeworthy...in the sense that it literally makes you cringe.From there, we watch as things go full on kinky, as the mad doctor forms a romantic relationship with his, now mummified, mistress from hell...whom he feeds other women that he keeps bound and naked in his home dungeon.Obviously, after witnessing what he does...the young doctor helps Kirsty break out.But he doesn't last too long...and she's, once again, left to fight Julia...and the mad doctor...on her own (at least at first).(Because) The mad doctor- driven by an obsession to obtain occult knowledge- plans to use a traumatized young patient- named Tiffany- who he has been training to solve the puzzle boxes he has in his possession- to open a portal to hell.When she does...their two worlds become one...as it enables Pinhead and his Cenobite minions to cross over into their dimension...while Kristy and Tiffany use the portal to enter Hell, with hopes they can free their parents from the confines of the labyrinth...which it is suggested, is the mind.Upon confronting Kristy, Pinhead poses the question: if, when you enter Hell, you are trapped within your own mind...is it even possible to free another person, who is trapped in their own personal hell?A very profound question, that requires psychological, mythological, and theological considerations to even begin to address.Though, one particularly applicable to the situation that Kristy finds herself in.Thus, in order to navigate her way through this mental prison, in which she has become trapped- and save her father- Kristy must confront her own trauma head on, and battle the demons that dwell within her own mind.Her katabasis.Though, I suppose it is also possible she really does traverse the dimensional boundaries into actual Hell...considering the young girl also goes through the experience, and all.Either way, this all acts as a metaphor for them being trapped in a mental asylum (while, arguably, not even being crazy...or guilty of anything).In this sense, the Cenobites become like the patients (whom Kristy is trying to free from the hell's of their own minds...by reminding them of who they were when they were humans); while the doctor/leviathan cenobite beast (who attempts to hold a coup in hell) is symbolic of the authoritarian level of control that the overseeing doctor has over the patients in an asylum.The whole narrative in this film seems to be derived from the story of Guanyin- a Chinese princess, who chose an aesthetic life, over one of a politically arranged marriage...before becoming a bodhisattva, and willingly going to hell, so that she could free the souls that have become trapped there.And I really like the introduction of the character of Tiffany.I'm hoping she maintains a leading role in the rest of the series, going forward.Despite the fact that Barker delegated the screenplay writing and directorial roles to others for the production of this feature...it is actually the better of the two films.Storywise, it's much more complex than the first film...and does much more for the worldbuilding of the series.While the setting and special effects continue to be badass.Having watched the first two films now, I still feel like the Hellraiser story is incomplete.You are just left with so many questions about the world and it's characters.That being said...it's a good way to keep you engaged with the series, as it continues.Looking forward to watching Hellraiser III!7 out 10.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
66,ivo-cobra8,A classic horror decent very solid Hellraiser worthy sequel!,10,20 March 2016,"Hellbound: Hellraiser II (1988) is very solid and decent horror flick and it is my third favorite horror film. I love this movie, it is far was betters sequel than any other movies are doing sequels today. A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge (1985) should have been a sequel like is this one film Hellbound: Hellraiser II which is very awesome and decent solid horror flick to Clive Barker's Original film Hellraiser (1987) that I absolutely love to death. I love this one a lot, it is my third favorite film in the franchise. Clare Higgins, Ashley Laurence, Sean Chapman and Doug Bradley did all return from the first film to star in the sequel that I absolutely love. I love the story ark, the characters and that it is completely different film from the first one and doesn't copy Clive Barker's Hellraiser.""Kirsty... you have surprisingly good taste in men. They didn't tell you, did they? They've changed the rules of the fairy tale. I'm no longer just the wicked stepmother. Now I'm the evil queen. So come on!"" Plot: Kirsty is brought to an institution after the death of her family, where the occult-obsessive head resurrects Julia and unleashes the Cenobites once again.This time we see the character Kirsty Cotton (Ashley Laurence) once again which is completely different now, than she was in the first one. She is now looked in Channard hospital institution and when she founds out, that the cops find out the bloody mattress and they bring it Dr. Philip Channard's (Kenneth Cranham) home, when he resurrects Julia (Clare Higgins) with her help he want's to open the door to a gates of hell. When Kirsty find's out about this, she has to fight once for survival important she has to go back to hell and find her father, because he is suffering in a hell. With the help of her new friend Kyle MacRae (William Hope) which later Julia kill's him and Tiffany (Imogen Boorman), Kirtsy must fight and find out the door out of the hell, she must close the portal when she is trapped with Tifanny in the labyrinth of hell. That is the main plot about this film and is definitely a worth of watch for any horror fan. This movie really brings you into the hell that pinhead and frank talk about in the first one its so good and we learn who the Cenobites were, and it was cool seeing Kirsty explaining to the Cenobites that they were human once. The acting in this movie is decent and everyone does an awesome job.What I love about this movie: Kirsty (Ashley Laurence) face off with Julia and Uncle Frank (Sean Chapman), I love how Kirsty set's up Frank on fire when he tried to attack her, she responded back by burning down the house, as well as Frank's flesh. I am happy that she helped Tiffany Kirsty later tricks Doctor Channard by donning the deceased Julia's skin, giving Tiffany the opportunity to finish the Lament Configuration puzzle, killing Doctor Channard and allowing them to return home and close the gate between the two worlds. That was really awesome, I am happy that Tiffany killed Julia while tearing her skin down. The characters and the horrors are decent, the movie is very creepy more than the first one. I still love the first one much more than this one, but I still love this one, It is fantasy between heaven and earth. I love that Kirsty explains to the Cenobites that they were once human a long time ago. Clive Barker's first movie never explained the origins of the Cenobites in this movie he does. I love that Kirsty and Tiffany does have a happy ending in the film and that they are free. Clare Higgins is more hotter than she was in the first movie and I absolutely love beautiful Imogen Boorman. I am wondering what happened to Imogen Boorman where did she went is beyond me.Overral: Hellbound: Hellraiser II is my third favorite film in the franchise and get's a solid 10 by me, that I absolutely love this film to death. It is great and imaginative fantasy horror film, I recommended to any horror fan. The acting in this film is fantastic, it is fast paced and very entertaining. This film comes to me like Aliens (1986) another flick that I love that film to dead. I love Ashley Laurence and Imogen Boorman in here, I love that they do have a happy ending.Hellbound: Hellraiser II is a 1988 British-American horror film directed by Tony Randel.

67,fernandoschiavi,"Repeat some situations, but the idea of increasing the franchise's mythology, adding the Labyrinth and Leviathan, for example, give strength to the script",6,14 August 2021,"Having earned fourteen times its budget at the box office, Hellraiser naturally ended up being classified as a great success, despite the many negative reviews the work had received at the time. That said, just over a year later their sequel, Hellraiser II - Reborn from the Dark, hit theaters, continuing the story of Kirsty (Ashley Laurence) and her accidental involvement with the cenobites.The plot takes place shortly after the events of the first film, in such a way that the feature film is already opened with a sequence that summarizes the events of the previous work. Then we see the emergence of the iconic Pinhead (Doug Bradley), who, to our surprise, was an ordinary person who had unlocked the secret of one of the cubes. The focus then shifts to Kirsty, now in a mental hospital, since, as in any good horror movie, no one believes her story - something that, in this case, we have to accept, after all, who would believe someone saying who had had his family killed by sadomasochists from Hell, summoned by a magic cube? What Kirsty didn't expect is that her story with the cenobites isn't over yet.Hellraiser was never a great movie, in fact, it can barely qualify as ""good"" as its many problems are hardly ignored. Even so, it is a work sustained almost exclusively by its look, which is worthy of going down in cinema history as one of the most frightening representations of the underworld. This is the factor that makes the first film something emblematic and much of this is due to the limited information provided by Clive Barker's script. In essence, all we know is that the mysterious cube summons these demonic creatures and nothing else. Such a question, of course, allows the atmosphere of horror to be established in an engaging way, leaving much to the viewer's imagination.Hellraiser II, in turn, often ignores this aspect of its predecessor, bringing us details that undermine the mythology created by Barker - details that we never ask to see. By showing how the iconic Pinhead arose, in addition to revealing that all the other cenobites, too, were once human, his mysterious figure loses much of its luster, as now, somehow, the relationship of the spectator with the villain is made possible. At certain points we see him as a victim, just as Kirsty is - his curiosity was his undoing, and our knowledge of it pushes limits on our imagination.And, albeit with some errors, Hellraiser II: Reborn of Darkness manages to improve and deepen the entire story about this Parallel Universe of pain and pleasure, as the story focuses especially on increasing that scope. The idea of the existence of several enigmas of the Configuration of Lamentations shows the vastness of this world. From the second act, practically the entire adventure takes place inside the Labyrinth, the Hell of the Cenobites. Here, the full appearance of the Order, of Pinhead and his minions also stands out. It could be a bad thing, since the antagonist's excessive use can discredit his image. However, that doesn't happen in this movie for the reason that its entrances get to be powerful, and of course with an atmosphere and a soundtrack that mark the presence of such creatures. Even the appearances of other characters from the previous film also create an idea of continuity.This great slip, however, does not make this continuation something totally execrable, even if it is inferior to the original, even though many of the problems of the previous work were corrected. Tony Randel, having this as his first feature film, proves to be a far superior director to Barker, using his decoupage to play with the viewer's perception, taking away our notion of space in the many sequences set in the world of the cenobites. The feeling of claustrophobia is created, as we find ourselves as lost in that place as the protagonist herself. Furthermore, it is necessary to note how the film does not sin in its changes of focus in the same way as the previous one, knowing how to work with parallel times more organically.Here, the use of practical effects here is even improved. With a bigger budget, which is visible in production, the Cenobites and producers could literally use rivers and rivers of blood. Not least, the scenes are effusively stained in red tones in practically every corner. The return of Julia Cotton, the previous character through a bloodied mattress, is one of the most emblematic scenes in the film, and it abuses this graphic violence. As for the special effects, focused especially from the second act, logically for the current advances they are extremely dated. However, even so, for the time they were used correctly, without taking the position of practical effects, which remain the highlight of Hellraiser, coupled with competent direction and a play of light and shadow that causes this feeling of repulsion, but at the same time of curiosity.However, although the more technical aspects were improved or remained constant, it is not possible to say the same about the story. Undoubtedly the main problem of Hellraiser II: Dark Reborn. First, as much as it is a continuation of the previous year's feature, it ends up getting lost in creating a safe bridge to continue its story. At the end of Reborn from Hell, the house was torched and, in theory, the mattress where Julia died was also. But he appears intact, with just the bloodstains. In addition, Kirsty ends up with her ""boyfriend"" throwing the Setting of Lamentations into a bonfire. And here, she finds herself alone inside a madhouse. Therefore, there are errors that come to be gross of continuity. However, even abstracting such situations and a better expansion of mythology, there are still other problems, the change in tone.If the 1987 Hellraiser had a dark, unearthly tone of danger but not a Friday the 13th-style card-carrying slasher in Hellraiser II: Reborn from Darkness, the situation begins to change. As the script places most of its activities in Hell, we have a game of cat and mouse in this region. Here, Hellraiser loses one of its biggest mechanics, the mystery, to then be more tied to the idea of an antagonist who is always after the main characters. Even the twist within the third act, in which Pinhead realizes he once had his humanity, is unconvincing, and in fact completely wastes the character. There is a gap here between the mythology, which is authentic in its creation, and the script, which is not that creative. If before there was an aura of mystery, now the debacle of running practically takes the spotlight of the film.Peter Atkins' script, too, has clear flaws, such as the entire construction and use of the character Tiffany (Imogen Boorman), which is presented early in the film, forgotten for a long time and then rescued by the text, offering lousy justifications for their involvement in the overall plot, none of them truly convincing us. The fact that Kirsty wasn't the least bit traumatized by everything she'd seen before, either, is hard to believe, an issue that only gets worse with the protagonist's little reluctance to return to that distorted dimension. The antagonist himself, who later becomes Doctor Channard (Kenneth Cranham) in a Cenobite version is completely devoid of the same energy as the original Cenobites. It is clear that the script tried to be different from the original, but it was completely lost.Hellbound: Hellraiser II has two significant differences from the original movie. It features much more violence and gory scenes, and it's heavily exaggerated in the fantasy of its story, with most of the script being set in the hell of the cenobites. Overall, it's a little inferior to the Clive Barker movie, but still quite entertaining, with some pretty disturbing scenes like Dr. Channard's visit to the underground psychiatric clinic, where his patients are held in individual cells, and a of them in particular he has the insane habit of mutilating his own body violently thinking he is being devoured alive by worms; or the sequence of Dr. Channard's own transformation into a hideous cenobite suspended over his head by an enormous tentacle, presenting an infinity of sharp objects in his hands, and which all the time makes ironic comments and medical and surgical puns; or the scene showing several decomposed corpses hanging from ropes in the attic of Dr. Channard's house, which were slowly rotting among the pestilential flies and worms after serving as food for Julia to regain skin and physical shape.Furthermore, without much different to tell this time, the film is limited to the process of repeating some situations from the previous one, something that, in the continuity of the franchise, would promote the characters from the hell dimension to the repetition status that involves tinkering with the box/cube, face the demons and send them to hell. Hellraiser II may not be as powerful as its predecessor, but it's still a continuation that retains the roots of its franchise. Firstly, it is obvious to denote that the use of the sadomasochistic atmosphere, with enviable amounts of blood and gore still continues. The construction of the skinless human body as well as the oppressive atmosphere of the Cenobites remains. The direction manages to maintain the standard, and increases the addiction of the grotesque and curious even more in relation to the first one. Furthermore, Pinhead remains in the same majesty as ever. In addition, the idea of increasing the franchise's mythology, adding the Labyrinth, as well as the Leviathan, for example, give strength to guide the script and the viewer in even greater curiosities in this world. Seeing other Lament Settings, as well as scenes of the Cenobites and Julia's return is without a doubt awe-inspiring.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II

The film gives us two hells to visit. The psycho ward hell with its screams and patients and the real hell with its maze, spooky imagery.To me this movie had a Nightmare On Elm Street feel to it, Kirsty reminds me of Nancy and Tiffany reminded me a bit of Kristan, although still great which never stops like running through endless hallways and the Channard Cenobite, floating around, hooked to a phallic symbol, spitting out medical related lines. Good fun! I loved the mental ward massacre and the hellish visions (Tiffany's hell is not pleasant). The film moves fast, looks great, has lots of gore, lots of kool effects (loved the Cenobite making machine) and a wonderful score. But what is all the noise about again? Why are these people even in hell? They should've stayed home and played with themselves instead of demonic puzzle boxes.Ashley Laurence (Kristy) is again fab giving an even better performance than in the first one, Tiffany (Imogen Boorman) looked the part and gave an believable performance, Claire Higgins is back as the wicked stepmother Julia and is again on top form, William Hope (Channard) is very convincing as the twisted Doc, Doug Bradley gets to stretch and he works both as Pin Head and the officer he once was.All in all much better than the first, better storyline better effects and twisted imaginary.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II

The story, acting, cinematography and atmosphere in the first movie was much better. But this movie still had something else. They should have hired Lucia Fulci to direct both the first and second films.Kirsty in the mental hospital. She's just an OK actor, nothing great. The mute girl puzzle solver – sucks as an actor. She finally speaks towards the end of the movie and it's just a cliché garbage. The Assistant doctor's acting sucks. His dialogue sucks. He breaks into the Doctors house, what the hell was that, besides to move the plot along. At least he was killed off fairly quickly. The Doctors acting was good, but it could have been great with some better dialogue. As a Cenobite he was intense, but then goes comical cliché. Towards the end when he starts killing his patients, it sucked. Julia was great and she was given some great dialogue, but it should have been more. Frank was underused, and burning down his part of hell, and killing him in hell was nonsense. Cenobites were good, but underused. And I did not like that they were killed.What was great was when the Doctor was turned into a Cenobite, and then he says ""to think I resisted"" – that was good. The fx Claymation sucked.They should have elaborated on the Leviathon, and the original cenobites, & Pinheads human background, of why he searched out the box, like Frank.I've seen this movie many times. Last time was Nov of 2015, and now again Nov 7, 2017. So, no more surprises. And for that it had a bigger impact at first. Watching it now, it loses the impact, and the plot holes come out, and all the stupid decisions made. The first film is much better. It is not a perfect movie. But it had better story, acting, atmosphere, and cinematography. The music is good in #2, the acting is decent, but not great, the visuals are better in #2, but the comic dialogue and clichés are there and that hurts it.In the past couple of weeks I have watched parts 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 1 and 2. 1 is the best. 2 follows 1. 3 is a joke cliché mess. 4 is a mess. 5 is interesting and could have been much better. 6 is full on garbage. 8 is full of cliché and could have been much better. What 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 have is decent horror scenes with Pinhead that is lacking in 1 and 2.Rating for #2 is a B for a B movie. 7 stars.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II

He discovers the bloody mattress where Julia (Clare Higgins) was murdered as he resurrects her to help Dr. Channard summon the forces of evil. However Pinhead (Doug Bradley) and his Cenobite minions have returned unhappy as they seek revenge with now Kirsty being the only one that can stop this evil madness once again even if she literally has to go to hell.A brilliant and macabre sequel to Clive Barker's 1987 cult horror fantasy masterpiece! Tony Randall does his directorial debut has done a splendid job of crafting this follow-up. Barker serves as executive producer and this sequel gives the goods just like the original with surreal stunning imagery, graphic gore, torture, S&M and good atmosphere. In fact, the film is so gory that back in 1988 it was threatened with an ""X"" rating but luckily the uncut unrated version got to see the light of day on video in 1989 and DVD now, the movie offers plot twists with really cool special effects and creature effects for it's time. This installment even offers the origin of Pinhead who is every horror fanboy's favorite nail-headed creature from the abyss of oblivion and Christopher Young's score is chilling as always.Here is a satisfying follow-up that won't disappoint.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II

76,baileycrawly,A Worthy Follow-Up,9,3 March 2020,"This isn't like most horror sequels.
This movie neither introduces a new set of characters to face off the evil or put the cast of the original through some peril a second time for the simple purpose of making a sequel out of it.
This movie overlaps with the end of its predecessor, leaving what can only be described as an epic seamless viewing experience. And, having already established the major character arcs, this film relies less on character development than its predecessor, instead giving way to a much more intense film.
Many Hellraiser fans like to view this film as a continuation of the first rather than a sequel (which makes perfect sense) and, if that were the case, this is definitely the superior act of the film. There's no wasted time; it jumps directly into the story and keeps the surprises and gore at a maximum until the very end.This isn't a film without its faults, however. The practical effects, though still a powerful and meaningful part of the film, are dated and serve to take the viewer out of the film, and there were a few moments nearing the end of the film where the writing takes a dip in quality as though the screenwriter was running low on ideas and had no good insights regarding the ending of the film.
As with the first one, Doug Bradley's scenes are absolute knockouts. The demystification of the beast hasn't truly begun to occur at this point. Pinhead was still a fairly menacing enigma of a villain when Hellbound: Hellraiser II came out.
Despite the flaws, this is a satisfying film to watch. The recurring characters' roles (and their actors) were well used, the new characters are engaging enough to hold my interest throughout, and the premise, while campy, was far from boring.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
77,domino1003,This One Has Some Serious Issues!,8,6 June 2005,"""Hellbound: Hellraiser 2,"" delves deeper than the original film. For starters, you find out the origin of Pinhead (Doug Bradley). Before he was Pinhead, he was Captain Spencer, a soldier during the first World War. Spencer wanted to go deeper into the human condition, and finds it in the form of a puzzle box. The same box as in the previous film. Once you play with it, you get hooked (Literally!), and Spencer soon ends up in the depths of Hell with a new identity: Pinhead.Flash forward years later. The aftermath of the events of the previous film. Kirsty (Ashley Laurence)is in a mental asylum, having witnessed the events of the previous film. She's a mess: Her father Larry is dead, killed by her Uncle Frank, who took his skin. Her stepmother Julia is also dead, drained by Frank and left for the Cenobites on a bloody mattress. Frank/Larry is dead, pulled to pieces by the Cenobites when they found out what he had done. No wonder she's in a nut-house! But she isn't insane, it's just that the police think she is.One person who believes her is Dr. Channard (Kenneth Cranham). And he has good reason to: For years he has been studying the origins of the puzzle box and has a bit of a dark side as well. He also has a young girl as a patient named Tiffany (Imogen Boorman), who doesn't speak, and spends all her time solving puzzles. When the ""good"" doctor hears about Kirsty's story about what happened and about the bloody mattress, Channard decides to use the mattress to bring Julia (Clare Higgins)back to life.With the help of a few bodies (Courtesy of the asylum inmates), Julia gets her skin back and helps Channard with his desire: to know about the secrets of the box. Tiffany's puzzle-solving skills opens up the doorway. Kirsty discovers that Julia is back, and that her father is calling out to her, begging her to rescue him from his torment.The film is a lot more graphic than the previous film, but it digs deeper than the previous film. Also, Pinhead has more depth than the previous film.Worth a look and a must have in your collection.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
78,Rautus,An excellent follow up.,10,12 May 2007,"The sequel Hellbound: Hellraiser II is a very good follow up to Clive Barker's classic Hellraiser. Peter Atkins who wrote Hellraiser III and IV did a good script and Tony Randel did a good job directing it. We get to know a little more of the Lead Cenobite now with his famous name Pinhead, we also get to see Julia forced to suck the blood from people to make her flesh return again just like Frank in the first film.Hellraiser II lets you see what is inside the Cenobites world with it's corridors that lead to different experiences and we get to the the heart of it all Leviathan. Ashley Laurence returns as Kirsty Cotton who teams up with mute girl Tiffany played by Imogen Boorman who is an expert at solving puzzles and Dr. Channard played by Kenneth Cranham uses her to open it.Hellbound: Hellraiser II is a sequel that's fun to watch.

79,emperor_bender,Just as good if not better than the original,8,25 January 2008,"Most people are automatically gonna give this one a low rating because it isn't the original. My question: so what? Many sequels have surpassed the originals, but the closed minded people who watch these like to bad mouth any sequels made. This movie was just as good, if not better than the original. There's a new storyline than the original, which makes it something fun and new. Many will cry and complain that it's new, but its important to try new things. And this film succeeds. We even get to learn a little about the shady cenobites, particularly Pinhead (Lead Cenobite). My only regret to this movie was that some of the characters were built up quite nicely, only to be killed off once we actually got to know and like them. Other characters should have died much earlier on or even in the original. But I will not let that ruin your viewing of this movie. Highly recommended for fans of the original.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
80,Gafke,Sweet Suffering,8,16 April 2004,"This sequel to the groundbreaking ""Hellraiser"" is every bit as innovative and gory (if not gorier) than the first. Picking up right where the first film ended, ""Hellbound"" finds Kirsty Cotton in a mental institution, being questioned by police who have just found the bloody ruin in her fathers house. Not believing her story of demons and puzzle boxes from Hell, Kirsty is left in the Channard Institute, dismissed as a shell shocked lunatic. Unfortunately for Kirsty, not only is she completely sane but Doctor Channard, head of the Institution, believes her story. It seems the good doctor has been searching for the Lament Configuration for a very long time. The blood is soon flowing as Channard releases Julia from hell (through a very bloody doorway in a stained mattress) and supplies her with an inexhaustible amount of nubile young women to feed upon. Meanwhile, Kirsty takes an interest in a mute girl, Tiffany, who has a convenient knack for solving puzzles. She also gets a surprise visitor in the middle of the night; a skinless horror who scrawls a plea for help in blood upon the wall (a message that fans of Trent Reznor will have no problem recognizing). Kirsty, convinced her dead father is trapped in Hell, strikes out to save his soul. But Channard and Julia have beaten her to the puzzle box, and force young and innocent Tiffany to open it for them. Pinhead, making a most majestic entrance amid lightening and smoke, is wonderful to watch as he regally roams the corridors of Hell like the King of Pain himself. A GREAT and stunning prologue also tells us the tale of Pinheads' beginning, and the end sees him come full circle as he uses his instruments of torture to save the lives and souls of Kirsty and Tiffany.This is a nice, bloody, nasty sequel with interesting new characters and some neat surprises. It manages to answer most of the questions posed in the first film and does it with as much blood, guts and torn skin as possible. The great setting of the mental institution sets just the right mood, as the screams of the violently insane echo up and down the corridors of the hospital, which are not so very different from the halls of Hell. Careful attention is paid here to light, shadow, music and movement, and it all pays off, giving us what is probably the strongest entry in the Hellraiser series. Definitely worth seeing, even if only once.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
81,skybrick736,Hellbound: Hellraiser II,4,21 December 2017,"Hellbound has absolutely one thing going for it and that is simply continuity. Bringing back two of the main characters from Hellraiser ultimately made the film more intriguing to see how these characters were going to progress or have their fate sealed. Aside from bringing back central characters, notably Kristy (Ashley Laurence), and the cenobites, there is little in terms of appeal to the start of the Hellraiser franchise. The CGI is horrendous throughout, the dialogue is insufferable and there can't be enough said about that horrible cliché ending. Just two films through, the Hellraiser franchise obviously requires a certain taste for the torture side of horror, which can be shallow and dull.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
82,Bogey Man,"The goriest in the series, but not the greatest",7,16 June 2002,"Hellraiser 2: Hellbound is directed by Tony Randell who has also made Ticks. Hellbound is written by Peter Atkins who wrote also Hellraiser 3 and 4 and many other horror movies. Hellraiser 2 is pretty noteworthy horror experience, but it relies too much on splatter (plenty) and the stylishness suffers a little. The film starts immediately where the first film ended and our heroine Kirsty (Ashley Laurence) is in mental hospital, because no one believes her story of cenobites and Hell. Soon Pinhead and pals come to terrorize that hospital, too, and then the gore filled mayhem is ready to start. The plot is nothing special and it seems to be there only to deliver the many scenes of blood and splatter. The atmosphere is pretty creepy and the visions of Hell are gorgeous, but still this is not as scary and brilliant as Clive Barker's Hellraiser, the original. But Hellbound is still pretty enjoyable film for horror fans and I think I begin to like this little more now as I'm writing about it. Fact is that the film relies too much on long scenes of mutilation and splatter, and that's pretty stupid at times. The overall look of the film is very dark and also surreal, so this is interesting to watch and enjoy the imagery of the nightmare. If Barker had directed this one, I think there would've been less gore and more terror and atmosphere. I think this first sequel is pretty equal with Hellraiser 3: Hell on Earth and these films work fine if one likes to watch all kind of horror films, sequels included. Hellraiser is a masterpiece of horror cinema, and these sequels try to come close to it. Hellbound is watchable sequel and works as a splattery horror film, and I'm very glad they concentrated a little on those stylish and atmospheric scenes, too. These cinematically more noteworthy scenes are the ones that make this film watchable for demanding horror fans, too. If you can't handle splatter effects, don't try to watch this as this is the goriest in the series. Couple of scenes are almost so over the top they become little laughable, and I think this was not the film makers' intention. Hellraiser 2 is not a masterpiece but an okay sequel effort for the ones who like these. The others stay away.7/10",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
83,bh_tafe3,Very Disappointing film,1,6 December 2008,"The Hellraiser guys really pulled a number on themselves here by following up arguably the best horror film of the 80s with one of the worst.This film just doesn't work, but in many ways it does exactly what a sequel should do, which is take what we've learnt in the first film and expand on it in over the top fashion. Unfortunately this film goes so over the top that it's nearly impossible to watch.In this one the audience is taken into hell, with Kirsty, sole survivor of the first film our tour guide. Again this is a terrific idea and they really go all out to make hell a surreal and horrifying place, but it just doesn't work. I mean Kirsty ends up befriending a young kid and wearing some fake human skin so she can save her life at movie's end and then we have a Disney soundtrack in the background and a feel good moment. Who's supposed to be watching this movie? Little kids? I won't complain too much because I'm not a whiner, but there is too much meaningless carnage, too much Pinhead and too little story for me to rate it as anything but a disappointment.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II

I have to say that the quality of practical effects is (almost) always top notch. The realism of some dead bodies, or the make up on Julia when she is summoned back to Earth, is extremely well done, so nothing to say here. Hell locations looks creepy, physical sets were nicely build, they really paid attention to details, including the lighting. Regarding digital effects, well I was expecting an improvement, but I cannot complain too much, considering the technical limitations of the time, and the budget on play.The real problem with this movie is the story itself. The first movie was way much more intriguing, and overall was scarier than this one, the acting was better, and the main villain was terrifying. Sean Chapman gave a wonderful performance. The whole production was undertone, and I did not feel any kind of anxiety or climax. I also want to point out how annoying and useless Kirsty is in the movie: she constantly needs help from other people in order to survive and she always take the wrong decision.

The story is better, and even the directing is better. The first Hellraiser is always looked at as the instant classic, but the truth is that Hellbound is better in every way.

The imagination of this film is awesome. The first one is also good but in the second story is replaced by sheer brilliancy in the details of horror imagery. Secondly, I want to say that this a movie all fans of horror would have to see. It is the spirit of Clive Barker's early vision. Although he seems to not be so involved in the project in fact he and his closest friends were very involved in making this movie.

Artistic and malevolent, Hellbound is an inspiring dance of death in the land of Hell, where Hell finally is a truly terrifying place.I have never been so terrified of a portrayal of cinema's Hell as I was in Hellraiser. What Dreams May Come, Constantine, all relatively tame in comparison. The only other film that depicted Hell so dark is perhaps Beyond the Limits. I'm sure there are others, but those spring to mind readily.The effects and character's subtle nuances, emotions, and personal perspectives are so detailed, so rich, as to be truly an art form. Capturing in archetypal detail, the intricacies of each person's experience, I loved the use of surrealism as expressed not only by Julia, but by the M C Escher prints thrown about the film. At one point we find ourselves at the Lord of Labyrinth, Leviathan, who exists in a sort of living M C Escher, where each soul plays out it's own personal hell, trading soul for perfect apathy.Ashley Laurence returns as the lovely Kirsty Cotton, seeking to free her father who she believes is an innocent prisoner in Hell.

90,rparham,Pointless exercise,6,4 October 2004,"Occasionally, one of those movies comes along and you ask yourself: Why? Hellbound: Hellraiser II is a brilliant example of that situation in action.A sequel to the 1987 horror sleeper hit Hellraiser, Hellbound exists simply to keep that business flowing. It has no other purpose.For legal reasons, Hellraiser director and screenwriter Clive Barker had to step down from direct creative control over the sequel, and screenwriter Peter Atkins and director Tony Randel stepped up to the plate to deliver a film that is actually more plot less, confusing and gore-filled than its predecessor. To describe Hellbound: Hellraiser II is an exercise in futility, but I will endeavor to explain it. Opening almost immediately after the conclusion of Hellraiser, Kirsty Cotton (Ashley Laurence), one of only two survivors of the first film, awakens in a psychiatric ward run by one Dr. Channard (Kenneth Cranham), a psychiatrist and surgeon who appears to have a side interest in the occult (how convenient). He discovers that an individual died on a mattress confiscated by police in Kirsty's father's house and determines that he must resurrect the individual on the mattress so he can get a better understanding of the afterlife, or another dimension, or something. So, he secures one of his more radical patients, takes him to his lavish home and proceeds to give him a straight razor to open himself up on the mattress, thus beginning the cycle of resurrection for Julia Cotton (Claire Higgins), who was Cenobite bait at the end of Hellraiser.Embued with flesh thanks to Channard's willingness to support her thirsty appetites for human blood and flesh, Julia agrees to show him everything he wants in Hell if he can only open the door. So, he recruits an autistic patient from his hospital, named Tiffany (Imogen Boorman), who has an amazing knack at solving puzzles, gives her one of the puzzle boxes that open the doors to Hell, and lets her rip. Meanwhile, Kirsty has had a vision of her father wallowing in Hell, and using a friendship with Channard's protégé, Kyle MacRae (William Hope) they brake into Channard's house to prevent Julia from being brought back from the dead, but they are two late, and end up watching as Channard lets Tiffany open the doors to Hell and then follow them in.To describe the rest of the film would be useless, because there isn't much point. The film has the barest thread of a plot, Kirsty's search for her father, but that is just an excuse for us to be witness to some of the goriest stuff ever put to screen. Hellbound: Hellraiser II is not an easy film to watch, and if you are even the slightest bit squeamish, just don't even bother. It is a constant stream of skinless bodies, people cutting themselves open, having themselves cut open, hearts ripped out, various torture implements stuck into skin, etc. There really are no characters to care about, everybody is thin as a sheet, and spend most of the film wandering around some dank, dark corridors running into various unsavory events and images. Randel isn't even trying to generate suspense, he is just letting the grotesqueries unfold on screen for all to see. We feel no tension or fear, no dread, just indifference. It also doesn't help that the film is wildly underexplained, as it's predecessor was. How is it that there apparently is somebody around every corner that has some strange interest in this puzzle box, and why has no one ever noticed that those who end up with it disappear never to return? I guess there is some message here about exploring the darker side of humanity, but it's buried underneath the gore. I must admit, when I was younger, I enjoyed this film, perhaps because the imagery was perverse enough to feed my need for rebellious youth, maybe I had a dark streak, who knows. But as time has progressed, I came to realize the Hellbound is nothing but an endless display of gory effects with no substance. I think we could all do better than this film for two hours of entertainment.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
91,Christopher_Reid,"Grotesque, horrific, entertaining if you're in the right mood",6,26 December 2020,"Maybe it wasn't the best time for me to watch this, as I had a boil near my elbow and an expanding infection around it. That probably enhanced this movie's ability to make you feel queasy and light-headed.I remember being fascinated by VHS covers as a kid at video stores. Horror especially got my attention. Hellbound seems to satisfy some of those morbid curiosities I'm sure we all carry to some degree. It doesn't have a rich or interesting story or characters, but it's imaginative in other ways.There are all kinds of messed up images and concepts. It's weird that we watch horror movies in the first place. Why do we want to be scared, disgusted or horrified? I guess there has to be some sense of humour, morality or commentary on human nature for it to be properly enjoyable. But Hellbound seems to be more of a pure horror movie. I think that's why Ebert hated it and its predecessor. They're too depressing and pointless, even if the special effects are good and it establishes an effective mood.It would be better if it explored the parallels between pleasure and pain more, which are only slightly alluded to. That seems to be a common theme in horror movies in general. It also could have showed us more about the origin and motivation of the Cenobites. And the doctor and girl's past could have been fleshed out more.Apparently, it shares the record (with Titanic) for the most times two characters call out to each-other. I didn't notice so maybe that's a good thing. I was probably distracted by the disturbing and other-worldly visuals, wondering where it was going.I think the original is probably better, but as horror sequels go, Hellbound is decent.

92,CMRKeyboadist,Best Horror Movie Ever,10,18 November 2005,"This movie is quite simply the best horror movie I have ever seen. The movie is flawless in every way as far as I'm concerned. I first saw this movie back in the theaters when I was just about nine (my parents got me into the theater) and I remember being blown away. This installment was not directed by Clive Barker like the first one was but directed by Tony Randell and starring much of the same cast from the first also. The film takes right off where Hellraiser 1 leaves off and throws you into a world of Gothic horror, self mutilation, betrayal, and at times, I think, has a Shakespearean undertone. The film moves at an interesting pace as the first half of the movie introduces some new characters and interesting plot twists. It really tends to pick up though during the last 45 minutes of the movie as the cenobites bring you into their own world which to this day still gives me nightmares. I think the most original thing about this movie is the Chanard character who in the second half of the movie is probably the most terrifying character to ever appear on the silver screen. I highly recommomend this film to anyone who likes any type of horror. You won't be disappointed.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
93,kingofdanerds,"Used to think that this was better than the original, now that is not the case",7,29 April 2021,"Hellraiser was a big success and sure enough, a second film was made and released the following year in 1988. But, a sequel was already greenlit when the first film was in post production. So it is safe to say that there is a lot that this film should bring to the table. Clive Barker (who was the author of the original book and wrote and directed the first film) stepped away from the director's chair this time and instead was a producer and this time Tony Randel (who did makeup effects on Escape from New York) is in the director's chair. Much of the original cast (and I say most) returned for this film with Ashley Laurence being the lead for this film. The film was still a modest success at the time of release, so much so that a third Hellraiser film was released in 1992.Kirsty is in a mental hospital run by Dr. Chanard. Police have found the dead bodies and want answers. Kirsty recieves a message from who she thinks is her father who is trapped in hell. It is up to Kirsty to help rescue her father and along the way she will meet an old friend...Hellbound: Hellraiser II was one of those films that when I first watched it, I liked it better than the original. Now, that is not so much the case. Hellbound: Hellraiser II retains much of the same style and tone of the original which makes this an easy double feature with the original film (much like the first two Halloween films). What Hellbound: Hellraiser II does is try to go bigger and bigger it goes with it's special effects. The special effects are just plain amazing and dare I say, better than the original though I do not think that I can argue that there is more gore in this film than previously. The acting is heavily improved this time around and here is something original. Apparently there was ADR used and what not. Anyways..... I find the acting to be improved. Gone is the hammy line deliveries. The Cenobites are in the film a little bit more and their role in the film is probably the best depiction of the Cenobites in any of the Hellraiser films (at least that I can recall). We even get a small bit of an origin story of Pinhead in the very beginning of the film. Now my big negative with this film is it's story which is a mess. Now I can largely watch this film without any problem with regards to the story. The story just does not work well with me. Gone is the eroticism of the first film and whatnot. The story brings up interesting points and then just does not expand upon them. Along the way, I find lots of inconsistancies with the film as well. There is alot and I mean A LOT. There is one big key point of the story (perhaps already mentioned) that I cannot go too deep into without spoiling the film. Let's just say that the story should have been rewritten. Some questions are raised about the amount of Lament Configuration boxes in existence as we before believed that there was one and to my knowledge there is only one (except in this film where multiple are shown but only one is in use). Location change from England to America (which slipped past me the first time I watched this film). Those are really the only ones that I can truly give out without spoiling the film.The question remains..... Is Hellbound: Hellraiser II a fun film? Yes, I think so. Hellbound: Hellraiser II is not any better than Hellraiser. It just isn't. By itself, it could be a great film. But as a sequel, it pales.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
94,jdring2007,"impressive grisly visuals and interesting, albeit underdeveloped story, satisfying ending but disappointing Cenobites",7,10 November 2021,"I've read and heard from many sources that this is considered as good if not better than the original. Can't say I agree. Almost as good, sure. Lacking from the first movie in this one was a level of shock factor, of course, as we've already seen much of the similar hotel before, or at least how it's done, but that said it's done very well for its time and very disturbingly, thanks to the brilliantly twisted mind of Clive Barker, my second favorite author or all time. That said I felt like his story and ideas were condensed into this movie, leaving it a little underdeveloped on the narrative side. The final Cenobites scene was painfully underwhelming and while in writing it might hold more evocation, in the movie the humanization was laughable for me. Meanwhile the main villain is a floating distribution of puns and quips, albeit a host of really cool and disturbing practical effects. Perhaps the most blasé thing about the movie for me were the skinless characters, that shock/gross element dissipated after the first scene and they lost their terror real quick. At least the gory effects and the very ending were the film's saving grace for me, and last but not least Ashley Laurence.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II

I was pretty excited to see this film after enjoying the first film. Well I got what I wanted to see, but that doesn't make it great, just decent. The characters were boring and very, very dumb, even by horror standards. I was actually yelling at the screen, which I never do. Sometimes I just had to laugh. The music fit with the film, but there was one brief song that sounded like it belonged in a Silent Hill movie or game, I liked it. The gore was much more graphic than any Friday the 13th film, that says a lot. The special effects were cool. Like the title says, this film is better than most horror sequels. The unique plot and Cenobites only make it better. Check it out if you want something different, just don't expect anything great.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II

98,extravaluejotter,From Cricklewood to Pinewood,7,28 August 2006,"Clive Barker's horror-fantasy story progresses well in ""Hellraiser II"". Despite handing over the screen writing to Peter Atkins and direction to some hack who went on to work with the Power Rangers, this tale of love, obsession and buckets of gore still bears the Barker stamp.Production values rise in this sequel. A lot of the film is shot on set at Pinewood Studios, rather than the less glamorous Cricklewood locations of the original ""Hellraiser"". The special effects are wonderfully inventive and have clearly had more money thrown at them. Despite the odd bit of shaky scenery, ""Hellraiser II"" is a glossier and more muscular beast than its predecessor.Pushed forward by a strong cast (featuring the wonderful Kenneth Cranham), the film is a creepy ghost-train ride which reveals more about the world of the Cenobites. Like the original film, ""Hellraiser II"" is as much about human emotion as it is about shocks and scares. It is a worthy successor to a horror classic.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
99,shaun98,"Hard to judge properly, but let me give it a shot...?",6,12 April 2002,"Looking back after nearly fifteen years, it's clear that ""Hellbound"" doesn't really hold up, especially when one compares it with it's semiclassic predecessor. The storyline and character motivations are muddled, to say the least, and there's little point to the affair. Truth be told, it was put together in a hurry to cash in on the original's success. From what I understand, the production was a stressful affair for all concerned. I suspect New World, on its last legs, was desperate for a hit.
Yet, if you just sit back and let it entertain you on its own terms, it actually has a certain weird appeal. It makes little sense by human standards of logic, but it's great to watch when you're drunk or stoned. (Preferably both) If nothing, it works on a visceral level. The most graphic portion of the film concerns an act of self-mutilation, and a subsequent resurrection of a character from the original...minus her skin. It still has the capacity to disturb. In keeping with giving credit where it's due, the performances are more than adequate given the circumstances. Kenneth Cranham is effective as an amoral psychologist, and his eventual transformation is a masterpiece of makeup technology. Doug Bradley seems more comfortable playing Pinhead, and Ashley Laurence likewise has a better grip on her role than she originally did.
Speaking of Pinhead, he receives more screen time than he did in part one, and his back story puts the Cenobites in a whole new light. One cannot discount the originality of Clive Barker's vision of Hell, although the time and budgetary constraints do hamper the effect to a degree. Nonetheless, the concept deserves credit for breaking away from the outmoded concept of sinners burning forever.**1/2 (out of ****)Released by New World Pictures",Hellbound - Hellraiser II

101,Minus_The_Beer,Into Hell Again.,8,25 August 2010,"Picking up where the original left off, ""Hellbound: Hellraiser II"" follows our unlikely hero from the first film, Kristy (Ashley Laurence), as she is plunged into the depths of Hell in search for her father. With her is a new friend she made in the mental ward, Tiffany (Imogen Boorman), a mute with convenient puzzle-solving skills. Hot on her trail is her arch-nemesis and step mother, Julia (Claire Higgins), who has seduced Kristy's doctor and turned him onto the wild side of life (read: Hellraising good times).While the film lacks the vision and focus of the original, it's certainly a worthy successor with more than a few creepy elements at play. First and foremost, the visions of Hell are unique and unlike anything seen in film before it. Also, there's plenty of bloodshed and elaborate special effects and make-up work to go around, making this one almost as visually unsettling and disgusting as its predecessor. Director Tony Randel doesn't work the same sort of magic behind the camera as Barker (it doesn't help that the script is a bit bloated) but is more than up to the task of delivering an intense and visually striking follow-up. It's also worth noting that the film lets us in on a bit on the origins of the lead cenobite from the first film, Pinhead, as portrayed by Doug Bradley, in one of the film's most imaginative and intense sequences.While it's certainly not a patch on the original, for what it's worth, ""Hellbound: Hellraiser II"" is miles above and beyond the myriad of sequels that would follow in its wake. Fans of the first will appreciate the fact that it attempts to take things one step further, and although it stumbles along the way, in the end, it's a gruesome and grueling experience that more than lives up to its name.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
102,ary,"Violent, shocking and brutal",9,5 October 1999,"This grotesque movie is a rare example of a sequence that is better than the original. With an interesting and brave storyline, that mixes such different elements, like pain and pleasure, excellent special effects (the ending is a visual show, with bombastic scenes, like the Leviathan), terrific performances (good part of the original cast is back, including talented English actress Clare Higgins as Julia, and Ashley Laurence) and a daring filmmaker, Tony Randel. The storyline places Kirsty into a psychiatric hospital, commanded by the equally brilliant and evil dr. Channard (Kenneth Cranham, excellent. His part is unique, and Cranham makes his character a Humphrey Bogart type. Everything in Channard resembles Bogart). Channard manages to bring Julia, the evil stepmother, back, through the mattress,and not only he brings Julia back, but he also unleashes the cenobites. Counting with the help of a mute girl named Tiffany and Kyle,a medical assistant who learns too much too late and who ends up suffering a lot inside julia's arms (William Hope makes his even small interpretation one of the best things in the film), Kirsty decides to put an end in the cenobites. What is so good about Randel's direction and Peter Atkin's script is that both are not afraid to shot this sick, but interesting, story in a realistic and cruel way.

Kirsty befriends a little girl, who happens to be a genius at solving puzzles and is the only way to stop Channard by solving a puzzle in hell.Although this sequel continued its graphic originality, it took the plot way to far once hell became a major setting. The graphics that were used were also extremely cheesy(even for the 80s). Although I must admit that this is by no means the worst movie ever made or even terrible for a sequel to a low-budget horror film. The beginning of the film possessed great potential and had classic written all over it, but quickly became incoherent and confusing. Hellbound takes a relatively unrealistic but accepted plot and takes it way too far. It takes it so far that it makes the movie too ridiculous to watch and enough to the point where it will be forgotten. Overall, the movie is by no means terrible but can easily be thrown in with other bad horror sequels.I do not recommend this movie.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
105,thelastblogontheleft,"Doesn't Match the Original, but Still Awesome",7,7 July 2017,"Clive Barker wrote the story but he didn't direct this one as he did the first — Tony Randel stepped in after editing the original, and Barker took the role of executive producer. From what I've read they got a little sloppy as far as using some stills from scenes that wound up being cut in their promos, and changing up the Chatterer cenobite (giving him eyes) to the chagrin of die-hard Hellraiser fans. I was also interested to read that Randel and the rest of the crew fully expected Julia to step in and sort of take over Pinhead's role as the pillar of the remaining movies, but when she declined to take part in any further sequels (and when they saw how massive of a hit Pinhead was in the first film), they kept him as the main villain.The sequel begins mere hours after the ending of the first — Kirsty is in a psychiatric hospital, still having visions of all the horrors she experienced. She meets Dr. Channard (the appropriately evil Kenneth Cranham) and his assistant Kyle (William Hope), and urges them to destroy the mattress that Julia had died on. It is soon revealed that Dr. Channard — a wicked man who is comfortable using others for his own sick experiments — is well aware of the power of that mattress and the Lament Configuration itself and he's eager to do his own research. He brings one of his psychiatric patients to his home and offers the manic, restlessly itching man a razorblade so his blood can resurrect Julia. Kyle has witnessed the whole thing after he became suspicious of Channard, but he is quickly sacrificed to complete Julia's physical form after him and Kirsty return together. It's then up to Kirsty and her new- found friend, Tiffany (Imogen Boorman) — a mute patient of Dr. Channard's who is particularly adept at puzzles — to defeat both Channard and Julia and escape the cenobites.I am a bit torn on how I feel about them showing the sort of ""background"" of Pinhead — also known as Captain Elliot Spencer — becoming what he is now. Part of his mystique, his larger than life personality, was not really knowing where he came from or how he found himself as the leader of these hellish demons. So to see him in the opening of the movie as just this nerdy looking guy was off putting. I think it adds to the sadness of the whole concept, which they explore more later on — the fact that all of these cenobites were once human — but it does put a dent in his horrifying armor.The scene where Dr. Channard has the psychiatric patient flaying himself open with a razor is more intense than I even remembered. It's just one of those scenes where you just stare open-mouthed in disbelief. And Channard's mix of disgust and morbid fascination is perfect.The bloody, muscley suit they have Julia in is BRILLIANT. The special effects team did an incredible job, truly. It's so glistening and REAL looking (I mean, I don't actually know what a person without skin would look like, but if I had to guess, that would be it.)The scene when the cenobites show up is, true to form, FANTASTIC. I just love the whole process — the wind starts gusting in, thunder starts booming, lightning flashes, glass shatters, and right when you think the chaos has settled the room literally just OPENS UP, stretching out old cobwebs and revealing this otherworldly glow. And then out they come, each more horrifying than the last, until we get to Pinhead himself who is just THE MOST EPIC VILLAIN EVER I AM NEVER OVER IT.They clearly set up Julia to be the new #1, even having her repeat some of Pinhead's classic lines like ""Come, I have such sights to show you"" as she escorts Dr. Channard around. She would have been a worthy rival, really.The maze that they are existing in is pretty awesome, partially for its sheer expansiveness they show it from above in one scene and it's just overwhelmingly massive. The star of the show is Leviathan, the ruling deity over the cenobites' home world — a monstrous, hovering octahedron that emits a horn-like noise that will haunt your dreams (composer Christopher Young even included the morse code for ""God"" in the sound) and an intense black beam that will force you to re-live past memories. Impressive, to say the least. I loved Channard being overwhelmed by its sheer enormity and uttering ""Oh, God"" and Julia responding with ""no, this is mine"".Dr. Channard being transformed into a cenobite himself is amazing, and his re- emergence — ""And to think I hesitated"" — is PERFECT. Chills. He has the creepiest laugh ever and he's sort of this maniacal, almost mischievous creature. He's straight up amused by the power he wields and completely uninhibited thanks to his utter lack of caring (not that he was ever held back by such a thing). What the other cenobites lack in enthusiasm he makes up for, without a doubt.And then comes one of the most disappointing scenes in all of my movie watching: Channard killing all of the cenobites, finishing with slashing Pinhead's throat. Again Pinhead is this omnipotent being, and he's not only reduced back to his human form but then killed off by this newbie cenobite's (admittedly awesome but stupid in this context) snake knives? COME ON NOW. Heartbreaking, honestly. But it's okay because Channard's head gets ripped in half not long after that and it's sweet, sweet revenge.Ultimately, I felt like it wasn't nearly as cohesive as the first film, but offered enough of the familiar awesomeness to be a worthwhile watch.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
106,alanmora,"""Your suffering will be legendary...Even in Hell!""",10,21 January 2008,"""Hellbound: Hellraiser 2"" is one of few sequels that actually matches, and in some instances surpasses, the original in terms of blood, guts and sheer terror. Bringing back nearly all of the actors from the original except for Andrew Robinson who played Larry in the original (his absence caused a great deal of chaos during filming which is obvious when you watch some of the final sequences that were originally supposed to include him) and Grace Kirby who played the female cenobite in the original (she is replaced here by the equally talented Barbie Wilde). The film picks right up where the original left of as it seems that no one believes the wild tale that Kirsty has to tell about her experiences so she is locked up in an asylum that is run by the diabolical Dr. Channard. The doctor's obsession with the occult and Hell leads him to conspire to bring Julia back to life. With the aid of a delusional patient from the hospital who tries to cut off bugs and maggots that aren't actually on his skin thus bleeding on the mattress where Julia died and bringing her back to life. In an interesting twist from the original plotine, Julia comes back in exactly the same condition as Frank was during the original and convinces the doctor to procure victims for her in order to help make her complete again. In exchange, Julia agrees to be the doctor's tour guide in Hell. The doctor's young apprentice befriends Kirsty and soon discovers the sinister plot between the doctor and Julia. Meanwhile, it seems that the doctor is also holding a mute young girl with a penchant for puzzles hostage and when she solves the puzzle box that opens the gates to Hell the cenobites are once again unleashed. With Hell now wide open Julia and the doctor enter as do Kirsty, the young mute and the doctor's apprentice. Kirsty is searching for her father and the others are just trying to escape. Meanwhile, Julia betrays the doctor and delivers him to her god Leviathan (in the form of an entity rather than a demon) and the doctor becomes an extremely powerful cenobite in his own right. In a strange plot twist Kirsty soon discovers that it's actually her Uncle Frank, and not her father, who has tricked her into coming to Hell in another attempt to entrap her. Meanwhile, the doctor goes on a bizarre rampage killing all of the cenobites after Kirsty reveals to them their true human nature. The end result is a strange and bizarre ending that has to be seen to be believed. Even though Clive Barker did not actually direct this film he was the Executive Producer and his influence is obvious. He had apparently intended, however, for the character of Julia to emerge as the lead villain of the series but the character of Pinhead became so unbelievably popular that it would be Pinhead, and the actor who played him Doug Bradley, who would emerge as the only actor ever to appear in all 8 films in the Hellraiser series. my advice to fans, however, is that if you only watch one of the sequels in the series, make it this one!",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
107,ryanpersaud-59415,"Could've Been a Great Sequel, It's Merely Good",6,29 October 2021,"The Good: The best aspects of Hellraiser II is its sense of style. Whereas the first film felt like a moody, erotic/psychological chamber drama, this one is a dark fantasy on steroids. When this movie is at its best, it's reminiscent of Pagemaster, The Neverending Story and (of course) Labryinth. (I was really getting that vibe as Tiffany was solving the puzzle and opened the door to hell, the music swells, the wind blows, the lighting and the smoke, cuts to Julia and the Doctor...)When we finally enter the gates of hell, the movie's visuals (boldly) lead into a world of terrifying surrealism. There are so many strange, disturbing, confusing visuals, you feel as if you're walking through a waking nightmare. The music is unbelievable here too; the dark circus theme is so effective at discombobulating the audience, the epic fantasy score is just perfect...when it comes to the aesthetics, this movie is absolutely incredible. But don't be fooled...Hellraiser II is BRUTAL. There are some extremely violent and gory scenes that snap you back into the reality of this most uncompromising of horror franchise. But unlike movies that would emerge later, the violence feels like there's a point to it.The Bad: Unfortunately, where this film falls flat is the substance. This movie has a terrible habit of things just...happening because the script demands it. It's a plot full of contrivances and inconsistencies; worst of all, Hellraiser II directly contradicts many elements from the first movie. The world building as it existed with the first one, seems to have been thrown out the window in the name of convenience. Not only that, but there are SO many plot holes. As a sample, I asked myself these questions through the movie:Why does Julia's transformation happen so quickly? Why does she seem excited to see the Box (wasn't Frank trying to avoid the Cenobites?) Why does Frank die? Why did the Doctor transform like that? How could he possibly kill the Cenobites? Why does he die? What are the Cenobites exactly and what control or role do they have re Hell?Lots of frustratingly unanswered questions. I was also somewhat disappointed by the lack of Cenobites in this movie. I mean, they're there, we learn *something* about them, but not much. In fact, if anything, this movie makes them appear like...losers who hang out in Hell, but have no control over anything. I guess that retroactively explains some stuff from the first...but it's a terrible idea for your marquis villains.The Ugly: Like many iconic 80s' horror franchises, this sequel is a solid entry and pretty essential to understand the franchise. However despite its creativity, ambition and excellent tone/style, this movie falls short because of bad writing. It's a shame, but I definitely still recommend it.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II

I only saw it because (shocker) I have only seen the first one, and an atrocious sequel that looks like it was made last year for about ten bucks.I really DIG the cenobites...and the visions of hell were very cool, but overall it's pretty forgettable.For the most part I only like the originals in horror franchises, and I am thinking Hellraiser is no exception to this general rule. I AM talking about the Australian R-rated version (99 mins) but according to reviewers there's no extra story in the unrated version, just some more gore. Well, again the gore was okay...some pretty vile and effective scenes...but i can't honestly say I'd like to see any MORE of it... (the scene with the guy cutting himself with a straight razor DID give me chills though).Pinhead has some cool lines in this, but ultimately I think I find the IDEA of the cenobites more frightening than the characters themselves. Pinhead's eerie ""We have such sights to show you..."" is really creepy if you pause for a moment to try to imagine what ""sights"" he is referring to.And that is what the first Hellraiser did so exceptionally well and this one fails to do: it left a lot to the imagination. I find the best horror flicks are ones that do just that. If you are going to see ONE of these movies...see the original. If you are going to see them all...good luck!

114,veganflimgeek,It hurts to think...,4,23 December 2003,"Spoilers for sure I have not seen any of the Hellraiser films past bloodline but I have yet to see a sequel that comes close to the original. While Hellbound has it's moments it ultimately fails. I read a old interview with Clive Barker right after it was released where he said `The screenplay and story Pete Atkins worked out made sense I am not sure what ended up on the screen'.
While I thought the whole story line with the doctor was awesome, Kirsty's involvement was not really needed. Indeed her being in the hospital was a little out of left field since she looked pretty ok at the end of the first film. Next why were the cops investigating the murder Americans? Duh correct me if I am wrong but didn't Hellraiser take place in England.Channard impressed me, as well as the scene where the man who thinks he is covered in maggots was cool. What was good about that scene is that I found myself squirming about it coming up. Ok the bad stuff. William hope as Kyle is so bad. The dialogue he speaks is painful. The wanna be arty stuff with Tiffany's delusions are so laughably bad I can't even believe it. The doll with the sewing needle and the sewn mouth. Come on! Also the box twisting out of the bed at the end, Oh god it looked so fake they should have just said no. Don't think though I didn't notice that one of the movers in the last scene was one of the movers at the house in the first film. Al this proves my theory that Kirsty was speaking for the director when she said the line of dialogue `When I think, I hurt'.

But I decided that I give one chance to I watch the sequel. And after that, I just finished watching ""Hellbound: Hellraiser II"" and I thought it was A LOT better than the original. Much better than I expected! Hellbound: Hellreaser II (1988) is one of the greatest sequel of 80s I've ever seen! They did a great job for the amazing special effects, the special makeup, the editing, the idea.. It was a little more disturbing, but in my opinion this movie got everything a little better than the first. I'm glad I enjoyed this one and I really hope I'll enjoy the third as well.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
117,StormSworder,If you like the original....,10,23 May 2005,"Hours after her family was torn apart by the Cenobites, Kirsty is in an institution, receives what appears to be a message for help from her dead father, who is apparently in hell. Before long, the head of the institution, with the help of the revived Julia and a puzzle-solving mute patient, is able to open the doorway to hell once again.This is a first-rate sequel to a great film. Once again, the story and the characters are great. Channard, whether in the form of the scheming, icy doctor or the snarling, bloodthirsty Leviathan, is a genuinely terrifying creation. The institution - a true place of the damned - and the labyrinth give the film a real dark fantasy feel.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
118,badfeelinganger,"like trying to compare ""Alien"" with ""Aliens"".",10,18 September 2014,"Hellbound: Hellraiser II could have been an unquestionably inferior sequel to the amazing first film if it had been placed into the hands of a director who had a conflicting visionary approach to material that had been strongly established by Clive Barker, but wouldn't you know it, director Tony Randel delivers one of those few follow ups that manages to stand on its own merits and follow suit to its predecessor. Perhaps the most fantastic aspect to the story is how the dimension of the Cenobites, Hell, is further explored as well as the customs of those who reside within it. This is a place built upon unspeakable, primal transgressive desires mixed with degenerative violence but at the same time, it possesses a strongly human element in the form of Pinhead and his Cenobite brothers and sisters. At one point, every inhabitant of this place of pain and ecstasy was a human being, not mere creations of will and Kirsty comes to realise that these so-called demons aren't necessarily evil despite their appearances. On that note, allow me to say I love the designs of Pinhead's brethren, my favourite possibly being the Chatterer.There really is nothing out there like the Cenobites they are utterly precious creations. This brings me to the further explanation of Pinhead himself and his relationship with Kirsty in this film and how I feel it is truly one of the best male/female relationships in the horror genre.There is no sexual tension to be found between the two and that is absolutely, unquestionably refreshing to me. So many interpersonal relations between a female hero and a male villain tends to automatically favour some type of erotic tension- not here. I mean sure, there is fan fiction out there that tries to imply there was of course, but the chemistry between Bradley and Laurence hinges more on an understand of each other than attraction. If Pinhead is intrigued by something of Kirsty's it is her intellect. You see, Kirsty has come to understand that Pinhead is a businessman and follows a code of conduct when it comes to hunting down errant souls of which he makes claim to.when she finds the fortitude and strength to make a deal with him, he is impressed and agrees to the mutual contract. At this moment, Pinhead realises that he isn't striking a bond with a frightened girl, but a tactical and logical mind which he thoroughly respects. I don't think I've seen a heroine take such a cerebral approach such as this and Laurence's strength and skill as an actress shines through as Kirsty begins adapts and starts to master an art that so many are unable to comprehend. Now, the question you may be asking yourself is, is it as good as the original? Its close. as part of the ongoing Hellraiser legacy, Hellbound is an excellent sequel",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
119,eldergod-1,Great ideas are wasted,5,18 March 2005,"""Hellbound"", the second part of the horror series ""Hellraiser"" is full with great ideas, which are, sadly, badly portrayed by the poor script. The movie is a direct sequel to the original and is telling the story of a nightmarish voyage in hell. The plot resembles the third movie in the rival ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" series because the action is set in a hospital and the main characters travel trough a disgusting netherworld. Although the cenobites are not as funny as Freddy Krueger, the movie vision of hell is very original, especially the evil Leviathan and the gruesome Channard. Sadly, the plot makes little sense and it is quite chaotic; also the film is needlessly gory and deserves an X-rating. SPOILER ALERT: The final of the film is also VERY stupid because it ruins the whole idea of cenobites getting back to humanity in their death - the scene in which Channard killed Pinhead and his band was surprisingly strong and almost touching, exceptionally when the Chattering cenobite was revealed as a teenage boy. All is ruined by the stupid closing scene, though, and - which is worse - more sequels are promised. In conclusion, I must say that the movie has its qualities, strong ideas and great, almost ""The Shining""-quality vision, but it is way too gory, very chaotic and with too many cheesy moments. In the hands of a better director, it might have been a classic. It is, however, a mediocre, although bizarre horror film.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
120,videodrome1234,Not better just bloodier,7,23 August 2014,"With HR 2 something interesting happened. The creators themselves broke apart the first one and made something almost completely new. HR 2 though only credits Barker as producer and co-writer, and Tony Randel was in the director's chair so he's not totally responsible for this newish scene. But it still is strange that he let the mythos he created to veer off in a new direction and for different things to be emphasized. Hellbound only starts a few hours after the first film and they started filming it a few weeks after they filmed the first one, it's still so different as the story allows despite the fact that it follows so closely on the heels of the first one. Of course that doesn't mean that the film is bad, in fact in a lot of ways it's really good. It's just that that original genius is lost and it sways to a whole different dimension. Doctor Channard is sent a new patient, a girl warning of the terrible creatures that have destroyed her family, Cenobites who offer the most intense sensations of pleasure and pain. But Channard has been searching for the doorway to Hell for years, and Kirsty must follow him to save her father and witness the power struggles among the newly damned. Peter Atkins with his first film and Barker didn't spend time on the script. A little bloodshed, a little chase and there you go the film is done. It's a typical sequel in the sense that it just needs to be more: more brutal in this case. But hey you can't complain when there is so much that can turn your stomach, blood is spilling, meat is tearing right? And when an insane guy goes ahead and tries to cut the bugs and creepy crawlies from his skin with a razor even the most tried and tested horror geeks have a second of feeling they would rather hide their eyes. But you won't and that's the beauty of it. And it must be said that a few of the effects really look good. Unfortunately along with the gory stuff there isn't time for the horror elements used in the first one, that means that the characters are less defined than the effects. Even if we get to see Julia deskined she still isn't as scary as in the first part with just a hammer. Tiffany is kind of a pointless character, Frank's short scene is that too. So only the quiet at first then scary as hell Dr. Channard carries the film. Kenneth Cranham is awesome. The demons of the first film that were scary when they just stood in one spot and stared at the camera get an origin story in this film. That's kind of a mistake with a character whose whole creepiness lies in the mystery surrounding them. And we meet a new Cenobite that wrecks the old ones in a minute. I thought they were scary, immoral, untouchable, unbeatable demons? What gives? The idea of them being defeated would have been laughable in the first film and even if they try to give all this a logical expanaition it doesn't change the result. Hell's depiction though is great for a while, but running around in the same darkened hallway and tunnel gets massively boring and repetitive in the end. Less would have been more. But the whole asylum's basement halls being a kind of hell is a great idea All in all Hellraiser's sequel has traces of the first part but looses what was so unique about it. But if you don't use the first as a jumping off point then this is a great film that horror fans will like. 7/10 https://www.youtube.com/user/Videodromeblog",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
121,TruPretender,Another artistic endeavor that continues to thrill all audiences alike-A classic follow up to a Classic.,8,29 October 2007,"After viewing the original ""Hellraiser"" and reviewing it, this film comes to mind as one of the more worthy follow ups to a classic. As all great films, with a subliminal message that doesn't need a sequel to follow it up, or explain more, ""Hellraiser"" was a film that encompassed the imagination with it's sheer and unsurpassed creativity and told a story with horrific, but beautiful tones. It was only inevitable that a sequel would come up sooner or later, to change the feel of the first film, and derail the novel ending. And as Hollywood driven as ""Hellbound: Hellraiser II"" is, it's a film that is full of surprises, and yet, keeps it traditional enough to match wits with the first film. Full of lavish production values, zenith class make-up and special effects, and gorgeous set design, and cinematography, this sequel did what only few sequels in film history have done: Take what the first film created and keep the original essence, while taking it to a new level. Thus, it's not a mere sequel, but a continuing. ""Hellraiser II"" gives you what the first film teased: Hell. We as the audience go to hell and back several times, while continuing a saga with the few surviving (in any way possible!) characters from the first film in the process. Kirsty, our heroin from the first film, has been put in a mental hospital, still convinced that the hellish crusade from the first film is not yet over, and direly believes her father to be in hell, awaiting her rescue, while Julia, our villainess from the first film, is back from the dead, and bringing a new depth of hell to earth, prominently fueled by a hellish God, Leviathan. The first of the films many surprises is the integrity from the first film is still intact. And that makes it a great sequel.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
122,Tophee,A Horror sequel not to be missed,8,11 January 1999,"Since most sequels are trash, cashing in on the success of their predecessors, I wasn't expecting this sequel to be anywhere near as good as the original Hellraiser.  How wrong could I be, Hellraiser II is every bit as good, continuing the original plot, maintaining the tension and exploring the characters, right upto the final ten minutes, where it all seems to fall apart for some reason.  Still, as far as sequels go, this is one of the best.  Watch it as part of a Hellraiser double-bill for twice the horror and a great evening.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
123,Waerdnotte,Don't bother with this absolute dross,1,9 April 2007,"Hellraiser was rather good if a little cheap and nasty, but the air of Britishness about it made it rather lovable. This however is of a quite different level. The script is almost non existent, and what there is is truly awful. There is little or no plot, and any kind of narrative is so poorly executed trying to understand the story is a fruitless exercise. The directing is truly pedestrian, the acting woeful, its only redeeming feature is the special effects.Maybe I'm expecting too much from this pathetic pile of tosh, but I have the feeling it was made for spotty, geeky teenage boys, with no life whatsoever, and no chance of ever getting a proper girlfriend. In those pre-internet days this was probably as good as it got for those rather sad little boys, no doubt they can find what they want on one of the many websites eager to give them a helping hand when it comes to a little bit of self-abuse these days.Like I say, don't bother with this rather pathetic 80's dross.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
124,blubb06,A lunch break in hell,6,5 August 2007,"To call this movie ""ingenious"" I'd have to watch it stoned, but it's not a total mess either. The true fans may have seen a really uncut ""uncut version"" that makes sense of the various ""horrible"" flashbacks of our hero(ine)s in the labyrinth, or of the labyrinth itself - the 1:39-DVD-version (PAL) does not.The first 40 minutes are very well worth watching. Starting off right where ""Hellraiser"" left off (and with some borrowed scenes) Kirsty, orphaned and traumatized survivor, is examined in a mental hospital while cops inspect the decaying corpses at her home. Dr. Chenard, her psychiatrist, is introduced on screen performing a lobotomy while holding a philosophic monologue, evoking creepy notions of the darkest side of ""psychiatry"" and instantly suggesting something is terribly wrong with him. Though apparently friendly and dedicated, albeit with a noticeable lack of affect, we suspect the guy slicing so coolly through living brain matter is capable of anything, and of course we're right. Chenard is a man of strange obsessions, a collector of macabre relics and explorer of occult-psychic phenomena. Intrigued by Kirsty's terrified ""ravings"" of demons and resurrection from hell through blood, he acquires the mattress her stepmother Julia died on, ready to test the theory with a little help from the incurable lunatics in his hospital's basement dungeon. So the inevitable blood feast starts, and Chenard gets what he is looking for - although in the end, of course, evil is defeated by the script.The Chenard character is very well drawn and acted by Kenneth Cranham, and his job description of course ideally chosen. Although he is ultimately just another human seduced by his desires, he is more complex than the sexy couple Frank & Julia or the arrow-straight Kirsty, or even the iconic Pinhead. When he is transformed into a cenobite, he becomes the mere extension of his operating tools - deprived of all his explorer's curiosity only the ""carnal"" pleasures of slashing into flesh remain.Chenard and the asylum are truly terrifying, psycho-horror assets of the movie. Right until after Julia is resurrected in a creepy-gory scene and Chenard displays his fleshly desires for her skinless ""mummified"" body, it's a real good hair-raiser. Then, the promising plot unravels into the obvious - and the inexplicable rest. Kirsty and Tiffany, a mute young girl obsessed with puzzles, run through an endless maze, run into the original cenobites (who let them go after pointless threats and teeth-clacking), meet them again, argue - Pinhead and his crew must really be starved for conversation - and in the end even sort of bond with them. The cenobites just needed a little reminder of their human origins. The cutest moment comes when they're annihilated and Pinhead is ""unmasked"" - greetings from Darth Vader. Dough Bradley is handsome (if no Adonis), but - oh, these skirts!, the nipple-clips! It's generally a bad idea to show Pinhead whole body (masked or unmasked) without a lot of smoke or chains. And when his eyes meet Kirsty's ... we KNOW HE HAS STILL GOOD (body parts) in him!!The cenobites are about as threatening as Grandma's false teeth. But there's the psychological horror we were hooked on from the start... er - ehm... we know (now) that Kirsty is not particularly blessed with forbidden desires. But Tiffany! She was in Chenard's claws for at least 6 weeks (months?), and has clearly experienced a severe trauma that made her mute. But - alas, we need to see the really uncut uncut version to find out what that was! We can only assume that Chenard physically messed with her brain and maybe did something to her mother. As for Chenard himself, I must have missed why he envisions the copulating couple in the hot bath. As for all the horrific visions - made flesh! - that hell must have sucked up during the ages, we can only imagine them. We came by at lunch break. Hell is infernally boring!Did I mention the special effects? I wonder why some say they're better than in the ""original"". The body make-up and atmosphere are believable enough, as they were in film one - it's all the animated stuff that nowadays looks crappy (the same applies to Hellraiser 3). The old VHS tapes leave much more to imagination - keep them! The only reason to buy the DVD is to enjoy more of the great score by Christopher Young - the Hellraiser theme is simply a classic.So - who messed it up? We just missed a great horror flick.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
125,Hellraiser-1,One of my favorites,7,25 September 2002,"Right, the original movie directed by Clive Barker was great but this sequel is for me one of the best second parts in horror cinema. The atmosphere of a nightmare is greatly created and the story is not so good as in the first movie but nevertheless it is never boring. As a gore-fest it is superb, special effects are very well made, characters are engaging, so...What more can you demand? I have seen this movie six or seven times and I still have it recorded in an video tape because I like to watch it again from time to time, the plot is not complicated at all but the reasons for watching it are the gore, special effects and its scary scenes, chiefly.

127,rickypeters-49138,Queen of Hell,9,22 July 2019,"For a sequel greenlit and shot within a year of the release of the first film, Hellbound: Hellraiser II is much more polished and thoughtful than it should be. The film follows traumatized Kirsty Cotten who's now in a mental hospital after the events of the first film (I guess her boyfriend was no help). She begins seeing visions of her skinned father, telling her to come find him in hell, but is that the smartest thing to do?Meanwhile, the demented head of this institution becomes obsessed with Kirsty's story and even manages to nab the mattress where Kirsty's evil stepmother, Julia, was killed. Before long, he's doing exactly what Julia did in the original film and supplying bodies to bring her back to life.There's also another patient in the hospital who doesn't speak, but who has a knack for solving puzzles.Hellbound is a busy, busy movie. There's so much going on that there's never a second to be bored or overthink anything going on in the film. It picks up exactly where the first film left off and is all the better for it, bringing back everyone except for Andrew Robinson. Ashley Lawrence makes for a terrific heroine once again and Claire Higgins steals the show as Julia once again - this time, wanting to be the queen of hell.The visuals and special effects are out of this world and even more impressive than the effects in the first film. The entire film is a feast for the eyes and ears (Christopher Young returns to score with even more bombast).",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
128,atomic_age57,One of the Goriest Horror Films of All Time,5,30 August 2007,"The Hellraiser series of horror films has always been one step ahead of its peers in the gore department, and Hellbound: Hellraiser II went all out to prove this in probably one of the goriest, nastiest, most disgusting scene ever filmed. I'm referring to, of course, the horrific scene of a mental patient slashing himself repeatedly with a straight razor to ""rid"" himself of the hallucination of being covered with bugs. The premise is that the mattress that Julia from the original film died on is possessed with her spirit, and that she needs blood to resurrect herself. Well, she gets plenty via the poor mental patient, who unloads buckets of it onto the mattress, thus bringing Julia screaming and dripping right out of the middle of it. It is a very difficult scene to watch; I have to give the director/producer credit for the sheer horror of it as is extremely effective. Definitely not for the squeamish!",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
129,davidkennedy-91087,Imaginative Sequel,9,7 October 2020,"Lime any good sequel, Hellbound: Hellraiser II catches up with the characters we loved from the original film, but expands upon the mythology and opens the film up a good deal. Everything is bigger, louder, nastier, and more expensive.Hellbound finds Kirsty, the heroine of the original film, locked in a mental asylum because she's been ranting and raving about demonic puzzle boxes and her dead uncle slipping into her father's skin. As it so happens, the head doctor of the asylum is interested in the occult and he ends up summoning Kirsty's homicidal stepmother, Julia, back through the mattress she died on in the last film.Much like Frank in the previous film, Julia needs sacrifices to grow her skin back and the insane doctor is only too happy to supply her with them with the hopes that she'll lead him to the underworld and answer all his questions about the other side. Kirsty wants to head to hell as well, because she has reason to believe her father is trapped there and needs her to bail him out.From the opening orchestral hits of Christopher Young's score, you know Hellbound is going to be bigger and more epic than the original, which was more of a small chamber piece about desperate people. This is a full blown dark fantasy for adults, almost like Labyrinth with much more gore, sex, and a large body count. Some of the story beats don't always work and some moments feel rushed, but it's such a great visceral and visual experience that you can tune those out.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II

132,saxon-7,Hellbound by definition,6,25 February 2006,"Hellbound is the first sequel to the great Hellraiser and unfortunately the worst of the first 4 movies but in no way all that bad because we get some background story on Pinhead and an unique look at a Hell dimension.It is set immediately after Hellraiser and continues the story of Kristy's ordeal. The story as such is good enough but it all seems a bit lacking, this can be due to the directing of Tony Randel who may have had a bit trouble getting his head around the 'bizaare' mind of Barker's universe, all in all he does a good enough job of it. What is great about this edition to the franchise apart from the fact that we learn more about Pinhead is the fact that we get to see how a Cenobite is made.The acting is all around okay but also seem a bit lacking or should we say confused: Clare Higgins does a better job here than she did in the first as Julia Cotton; the newly returned seductress. Ashley Laurence again does a good job portraying Kristy Cotton; now placed in a mental institution. Sean Chapman and Oliver Smith reprises their role as Frank Cotton/Skinless Frank with Smith also portraying Browning; another patient at the Mental institution, this they does in an equally good way as in the first. We of cause also have Doug Bradley in his cult role as Pinhead/Capt. Elliot Spencer; This time with the added background role of Pinheads former human self, This he does with high grades yet again (in fact there could be no other Pinhead). In smaller roles we have William Hope as Kyle MacRae; a doctor at the mental institution whom falls for Kristy, and Imorgen Boorman as Tiffany; a patient at the institution who solve various puzzles and never speaks. Both does a okay job of their respective characters. A small note will go to Kenneth Crantham who plays Dr. Channard with a smidge over the top affection for the Lament configuration.This is well worth the look if you haven't seen it, the look and feel of the hell dimension gives you an idea of how Hell can be even though it's not what we have come to expect from popular beliefs. If you're a Hellraiser fan then by all means see this, it is in fact a good addition to the story, perhaps more so than any of the others (well we have one more including Kristy, I think it's number 6, which also continues the story of the Cottons, but I haven't seen it at the time of writing this.).All in all I give this 6, which may not seem like that high a grade but is still a grade above where I question if this is a movie that should have a place in my collection or not. And this is definitive one in my collection (in fact it's part of the Hellraiser Puzzle Box collection released by Anchor Bay containing Hellraiser 1-3 plus a bonus disc containing two Shorts by Clive Barker).",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
133,bettybenzone,Visually Stunning Sequel,8,7 September 2021,"Clive Barker's Hellraiser was like a jolt of adrenaline shot into the horror genre's arm towards the end of the 80's when most of the big franchise were either dead or on their way to being dead. It seemed nearly impossible to make a sequel to a film so ferociously original, but Peter Atkins proves up to the task and delivers a great sequel that takes everything that worked about the original and multiplies it.Kirsty is now in a mental hospital after the events of the first film because no one will believe her. Her doctor, Dr. Channard, does and wants to open the portal of hell for himself to get answers to the afterlife. In doing this, he brings back Kirsty's wicked stepmother, Julia, and all hell literally breaks loose.In the visual sense, Hellbound looks much more expensive and expansive than the previous film. We get to see hell in all its labyrinthian glory and, at times, it feels more like a dark fantasy film than a straight up horror film. That is, until we get another close up of hooks or razor blades slicing into flesh to remind us that this is, in fact, a horror film. And a damn good one it is.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
134,brennenearl,My favorite,10,19 January 2019,I love the first movie and this one doesn't try to copy the first movie. Pinhead has more screentime in this one which is great. Kirsty adapts into the final girl. I like that this one goes for a different storyline. Julia's return is good I prefer her in this one then in the first one. So overall this is a perfect sequel,Hellbound - Hellraiser II
135,Django-21,Hmmmmm.............,6,10 March 2001,"Hellraiser was always going to be a hard act to follow (especially with Clive Barker handing over so much control to others).  This first sequel starts promisingly enough though, beginning on the same night as the original ended.  It features the return of Ashley Laurence's heroine Kirsty and the resurrection of wicked stepmom (no, really) Julia (Clare Higgins).  However about two thirds into the movie any attempt at story progression, character development or coherency goes out the window and instead the film throws up albeit interesting imagery and ideas seemingly at random.  That's not to say that Hellbound : Hellraiser 2 is a totally bad movie, it just seems like such a wasted opportunity.  If the next sequel would have followed on more directly (instead of going stateside and bringing in different characters) maybe the ideas about Hell and Leviathan could have been explored and developed more fully.  However without this safety blanket, much of Hellbound seems confused and half baked. Kenneth Cranham lends weight to the role of sinister Dr Channard but as soon as he's made into a cenobite the film goes into high camp and I wonder what happened to the sombre tone of the original.  Clare Higgins seems t be enjoying playing her return as Julia like a Hollywood bitch on drugs and it's interesting to find out something about the origin of the cenobites albeit briefly(and at least Pinhead's human origin is something that does get explored further in Hellraiser III).  If you like the first film, it's probably worth checking this one out and you may want t view it more than once to catch everything in it but just don't expect another Hellraiser like the original.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II

This is where it really starts to get good. I didn't care much for the first one but this one suprised me with how much i liked it. If you havent seen the Hellraiser series check it out. Just dont give up after the first one cause regardless of what a lot of people with tell you it only gets better.,Hellbound - Hellraiser II
137,patrick_bateman_90029,"Very sick, but a very beautiful follow-up",9,3 September 2003,"I first saw Hellbound in the fall of 2000 when I was re-introduced to Pinhead. At the time, I had only seen Hellraiser, Hell on Earth, Bloodline, and Inferno (which now, I wish I had not seen). I heard many things about it. Some said it was either as good as or better than the first. Some said that the film was full of enough gore to put the original to shame. And when I rented it, I was first appalled, then I was shocked, and finally, I was in awe.Taking over the director's reins from Clive Barker, Tony Randal, along with newcomer horror writer Peter Atkins (who would go on to do Hellraiser III and IV, as well as the first Wishmaster, not to mention cameoing as the Barbie Cenobite in III) create a film that manages to be a bit darker than the first, with a just as good cast.Starting right where the first ended, Kirsty is now in a mental hospital, run by Dr. Channard. He has frightening fascinations involving the puzzle box and the world of darkness within. So, he resurrects Julia, uses a mute patient to solve the box, and once again, Hell is brought to Earth. But this time, the viewer actually gets to see how Cenobites are created and explains more of the Hell that the Cenobites serve.I won't lie. When I first saw this, there were images in that film that stayed in my mind for a long time. Only finding the unrated version, I wasn't prepared for such sights as Skinless Julia, Hell's Labyrinth, and, especially, the Channard Cenobite. When I first saw him on-screen, I knew that he would be the one that would put Pinhead's seething darkness into shame.SPOILERSI was a little bit surprised, though, that the Channard Cenobite actually had the nerve within to kill the original Cenobites (sans Pinhead). I could already figure out that Female and Butterball would turn back into their normal human selves, but when the Chatterer changed back into a little kid, I was completely off guard. I was so shocked to see that the puzzle box would actually transform a little kid into a Cenobite.And the Channard Cenobite's death was a fitting death to such a creepy character. He was a monster as both human and a Cenobite. And it was also a pretty ironic way that he dies by the hand of Leviathan, who actually seemed to have chosen him as his new Dark Pope. Well, a fitting end to a frightening monster.END SPOILERSThe acting in this one has improved. Returning from the original are Clare Higgens (Julia), Ashley Lawrence (Kirsty), Sean Chapman (Frank), and Doug Bradley (Pinhead), who take their roles to a new level. New bloods Kenneth Cranham (Channard) and Imogen Boorman (Tiffany) help bring more life into the film, but what really makes it the best, besides Bob Keen's excellent skinless/Cenobite makeup, is Christopher Young's beautifully haunting score which gives the film its own emotion.So, the next time you go to your video store, don't get a Freddy, Jason, or Leatherface movie. Go to the ""H"" section and look for Hellbound: Hellraiser II, one of the 1980's best horror sequels.A+",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
138,kirkwuk,Outstanding adventure in horror,9,2 February 2009,"Hellraiser 2 is a startling film. Clive Barkers imagery of hell is profane, violent, and an oddly erotic movie from the off. The sequel continues the fantastic story, and builds on the characters we saw, whilst adding some new ones to the mix. As well as re-introducing the dead ones! As foul and degrading as newer gore porn flicks are today, Hellbound walks all over them with style and substance which has been unmatched ever since. For 1988, Hellraiser 2 is nothing short of breathtaking, and has not dated one bit. The storyline is intelligent and despite the incredible sights of hell and its inhabitants, Hellbound justifies the fantasy with thoughtful dialogue and logic and a powerful story. It also benefits that the cast in this film are mostly great actors who do a great job of suspending the viewers disbelief.Barker gives credibility to the monster in the movie. Every beast in this film has a human side and you may even feel warmed to them when they are faced with dilemmas and dramas which question even their beliefs. There is a powerful scene in which Pinhead and his minions learn of their own past from Kirsty, the heroin of the story who is pursued by the cenobites for opening the puzzle box. Pinhead even begins to look human at this point showing the ""bad guys"" in a different light. Before long the demons actually become the ""good guys"", and temporarily co-exist with Kirsty to counter the evil Doctor's hand over hell.The violence and gore offered by Hellbound is excessive and delivered to the viewer in such horrific, profane ways it has definitely had an impact on its viewing demographic. Barker made a great job of communicating to the director his view of the film from a novel and it's a gruesome one. So gruesome it will immediately turn away many within the opening minutes.I recommend this movie for anyone who's into horror or those who think the genre is just Hostel and Saw. Hellbound, as indeed the original, breathes new life into the horror movie and for every pint of spilled blood, brings intelligence and style in buckets.9/10",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
139,AndrewWalker747,Really good if you can stomach it! (SPOILERS),10,18 November 2001,"Ok, now this is not a bad movie at all, if you can stomach it and your not a soft person.  There was a lot of disturbing stuff that kinda backfired on the overall rating of the movie (ie. the mental patient cutting himself up-was that really necessary, couldnt Channard have just sat him on the mattress and Julia kill him?  Did he have to butcher himself like that?).However, some of the gore made the movie great, like watching what happened to Channard (Ive watched the movie many times, and I still cringe watching him getting turned into a cenobite!).  And the scene when Channard visits his patient is pretty scary and pretty graphic.Now as far as giving the cenobites a human side, I personally liked the idea.  It worked nicely with the fight scene with Channard and watching the cenobites die and going back to their human side.  Its the best scene in the movie if you ask me.Overall, I liked the movie.  True it was excessively gore, but if you dont get upset by that then this is a good movie.  The music is absoloutely great, their are a lot of scenes that make you cringe (the whole point of a horror flick), and the plot is simple yet enjoyable.  A must see if you like true horror and this great series.  8/10",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
140,severin72,Awful,2,26 October 2006,"The original is over-rated but this makes it look like Citizen Kane. With the possible exception of ""The Howling"" or ""The Exorcist"" this is the most precipitous drop-off in quality of a sequel ever. Good god, it's bad. Unpleasant imagery can be powerful if attached to a purpose and none is evident here. The film appears to have been edited together at random, and the story is incomprehensible. This has been blamed on Andrew Robinson's (well advised) refusal to participate necessitating frantic re-writes. As an excuse this is severely inadequate. Although the best portrayals of the devil tend to be minimalist (see the uncredited Dustin Hoffman in ""The Messenger"") depicting him (it?) as a giant black parallelogram is taking things a bit far. Pointless, even the effects have dated badly. The 2 rating is in recognition of the professionalism of Clare Higgins (who decides to have a pretty good go at creating a wicked stepmother for the ages) and the passable entertainment of counting how many times characters run up and down corridors yelling; ""Kirstie! Ashley!"".",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
141,LostHighway101,So-So Sequel,7,10 May 2008,"I'm lenient on horror sequels, and when you compare ""Hellbound"" to every other ""Hellraiser"" film, it's moderately enjoyable.The production design is good (the labyrinth looks great!) the creature and gore fx are top-notch, and the story tries its best to keep fresh (As much as I enjoyed the insight into Pinhead's past, I just wish it could have been elaborated on a little further.) The acting is bad, though, and the story isn't as tight a narrative as the first one. It also gets a little redundant considering the first film (the idea of Clare Higgins having to rejuvenate off of human bodies is oh-so-predictable).Overall though, it's a pretty gritty descent into hell. It may not invoke Dante, but it's still a chilling sequel. My favorite scene is Kirsty's reunion with Uncle Frank -- I wish the whole movie had that kind of Dante-esquire feeling of Hell's bizarre tortures. Unfortunately, the series was all downhill from here.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
142,donaldking,Repulsive but part-brilliant Eighties horror,6,19 March 2011,"Yes, it still seems repulsive and disgusting and 'not nice', but full of great flashes of style. The acting is pretty awful (with the exception of Kenneth Cranham - see below) and the scenes of girls running along dank grey corridors look rather like out-takes from 'The Crystal Maze.' The effects (especially those back shots of the psychiatric clinic) look rather cheap by today's standards, but this only adds to the attraction and style of the whole extraordinary ensemble, rather like those obviously fake Walt Disney castles and fields in Laurence Olivier's 'Henry the Fifth.' Shocking images flicker by at an exponential rate, and I felt rather like someone at a tawdry Soho peepshow - disgusted and shamed and appalled, but unable to stop looking.But not recommended... 1) for a cosy Saturday night watch with Grandma and the kids. 2) for psychiatric in-patients. 3) for easily offended Christians (this applies even more to the first film in the series). 4) those who've just eaten a big dinner.More seriously, is this kind of fare proof of the death-wish of Western culture? I'm not saying that merely watching it can turn perfectly sane people into sadomasochistic murderers, but doesn't its popularity go to prove (as if we really needed it) that we're all rather 'sick'? My cable provider is running the whole series of 'Hell', and announces them as 'The films that defined a generation.' Isn't that 'definition' rather worrying? Both for the generation concerned, and the ones to follow? I know many 21st century teenagers will just laugh their heads off at this film - which rather proves my point.P.S. Kenneth Cranham acts with incredible conviction (always rare to attain in horror films since the passing of the great Lugosi-Karloff and Cushing-Lee-Price days). Cranham looks the part of a slightly crazed doctor, and looks in genuine pain when he's floating in mid-air, like Kenneth Macmillan in David Lynch's 'Dune', with what looks like a giant condom growing from the top of his head.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II

That being said, it even surpassed my expectations. You'll have to see the first one in order to appreciate this one though. In this sequel a lot of things get explained, such as the origin of Pinhead, the lead Cynobite. Briefly but still interesting. Overall, it's an incoherent, messy, nightmarish acid trip that breaks all rules of reality as we literally enter hell, home of our bizarre yet huggable Cynobites. The make-up is as impressive as it was in the prequel and what it lacks in suspense, it makes up for with gore.

He brings us to a world where monsters have politics, the 5 senses rule, and we sometimes question whether our pre-notions of pain are as accurate as we think. The Hellraiser series is a lush, nightmarish, subliminal journey into human desire, masochism, mythos and madness. Pinhead is not so much the generic, evil antagtonist as he is a source of comfort and logic sometimes. Clive Barker has often toyed with our preconceptions that all ""monsters"" must be blindly destructive brutes, as opposed to the endearingly rational and decidedly intelligent Cenobites. Perhaps the fact that I have Cenobites tattooed makes me biased;) But it's still a unique piece with gorgeous imagery (to some.) Angels to some, demons to others...

This film is crucial in the sense that the audience now ventures into the ""nether region of experience"" and sees what it looks and feels like. Improvements from the first film include a faster storyline where we don't have to wait until the end to see Pinhead and his Cenobite friends. The film score is a greater representation of the hellish world and for once, it makes sense. The only thing I believe this film is lacking is more history and story in relation to ""Hell"" as shown in this film. More story based on Leviathan itself would also be a key improvement. In relation to the franchise, this is one of the go-to films.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II

Everyone thinks crazy old Kirsty Cotton is making up stories of demons from hell (which happened to be her attic), but we all know better, don't we?  She's now in a mental institution with a girl with a penchant for solving puzzles, under the guidance of a sadistic doctor with a penchant for a skinless Julia. Part of the story is just a re-hash of the first with different characters in similar situations.  This time around we go to hell and find that it's like an Escher painting with a giant ""Lament"" diamond spinning in the sky. Not as good as the first film, but pretty close--a bit gorier and disturbing (but after ""Hellraiser"", I was expecting this)  The acting is similar to the first film, but the special effects are a bit more elaborate this time around as the budget was bigger due to the success of it's predecessor.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
149,mattbowerbank-66872,"Bad then, bad now",3,14 September 2021,"This direct sequel to the first Hellraiser film, itself based on the Clive Barker novel ""Hellbound Heart"", really falls flat and fails to deliver anything worthwhile.The main issue is that the story is incredibly sloppy and merely a string of coincidences intended to push the plot forward in the needed angle. While the runtime is close to the original, it's a personal hell to get through as you'll be rolling your eyes over the cliches, cheesy one-liners and tropes used.What made the first Hellraiser good was that the Cenobites were mysterious with an unknown power and, while looking human, seemed to be otherworldly. In this installment, all that mystery is removed as Pinheads origin is revealed, as well as the other Cenobites, albeit in passing, and the concept of hell is added in. This is a big mistake; while the first was called Hellraiser, there wasn't actually any mention of a tactile hell, adding to the mystery of the Cenobites origin. Looking back at the original film where they refer to themselves as angels and demons, this sequel unquestionably pegs them as the latter, while not trying hard to explore the hedonistic sadomasochistic element of them.However, there are many problems with the film. Making the main antagonist a cenobite who retains his memories and emotions seems to break with the continuity of the first film, while delivering some lazy script. There are many other plot holes as well, such as Kirsty using the elevator in order to save Tiffany, the random nature of summoning a dead person through where they've been killed, why Kirsty is in a mental institute in the first place etc.If you liked the first, leave it as that. This film seems to be little more than a trip down memory lane for many people, but for first time viewers new to the series, it simply ruins what Clive Barker's excellent vision was.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II

I watched this solely based on the Amazon preview ""it remains the most brutally original sequel in horror film history"". I'm like damn ok bold statement. So I watched with no knowledge of the plot and therefore no expectations.It starts pretty slow and you're hoping it's not another terrible sequel (or like the 7th in a horror series) but the second half is really what the viewers came for. The production was obviously more advanced than the first but the gruesome scenes kept upping the previous ones. Great climax but you knew the ending is gonna lead to the next one, which I didnt plan on seeing but now I'm intrigued.TL;DR: I'm not a big horror fan but if you like shocking cinema, check this out especially if you liked the first.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
153,tonyband,"Hellbound is one of my all-time favorite horror films. Violence, fetishism, and perversion, Hellbound is a delicious feast.",10,2 February 2016,"In 1987, Clive Barker, the young master of literary horror, adapted his own novella, The Hellbound Heart, for the screen. In so doing, Hellraiser, which the writer also directed, became one of the seminal horror films of the 1980s and introduced the iconic Cenobites, leather and metal clad demons from Hell. These ""explorers in the further realms of experience"" come to earth only when they're called, when someone opens the mythical puzzle box known as the Lament Configuration. The Cenobites, led by Pinhead (Doug Bradley, Nightbreed), drag these willing souls into the depths to show them the limits of the flesh, pain and pleasure as one, from which there is no escape. One year after Hellraiser hit the screen, director Tony Randel (Fist of the North Star) took the reigns to helm the sequel, beginning right where the original left off.Hellbound: Hellraiser II also expands the franchise's central theme from carnal lust to general obsession, depicting Channard not as a lowly pervert but as a sociopath who'll stop at nothing to satisfy his intellectual curiosity. Take, for example, his passive reaction to Julia's femme fatale routine. The man clearly shows more interest in the woman's knowledge of hell than in her feminine wiles, which provides some justification for the extreme and often gratuitous violence in the movie.The term ""cenobite"" is not an invention of Clive Barker's. Cenobites, traditionally, are people who live by the precepts of religious monastic orders, and this gives the best signal to where Pinhead and his cohorts come from. Sure, they reside in Hell, but I've never seen them as evil. Pinhead is a demon of principle and a man of his word; giving people the extreme experiences they crave. As he tells the female Cenobite after Tiffany (Imogen Boorman), a mentally ill, puzzle obsessed girl, opens the box: ""It is not hands that call us, it is desire."" He knows that Dr. Channard forced her to solve the puzzle and he is uninterested in her. Channard wants to see Hell and Pinhead wants to fulfill Channard's desires. He's violent, but he's an agent; it's man that's the real evil.This sets the Hellraiser series apart from other horror movies.This Sequel ranks up there with the likes of The Godfather Part II (1974), The Empire Strikes Back (1980), and The Dark Knight (2008)",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
154,soralapio,A real letdown,4,29 June 2002,"Disclaimer: I loved the original Hellraiser. The characters were interesting, believable and above all human. That made it all the more terrifying. The Cenobites were mysterious and undeniably evil. I had high hopes for Hellraiser II.That being said, Hellbound: Hellraiser II is one of the biggest letdowns in movie history. Whereas in the original we had characters with believable motives (Julie was motivated by her lust for Frank, Frank was motivated by his obsession with pleasure and experiences etc...) in Hellraiser II we have bland caricatures. The bad guys are ridiculously evil, the good guys are pure and virtuous and nobody ever doubts anything. The original Hellraiser worked because we only saw glimpses of hell which allowed our imaginations to fill in the rest. There's nothing for the imagination to do here because the director felt like he should lay it all out for us. Tentacles, maggots, blades and blood galore. What's truly offensive is that the producers and director of the movie felt like they didn't need any of the basic elements used in movies and thought that the sheer amount of blood was enough to make a good movie. They were wrong. The further the movie goes, the worse it gets. By the time Kirsty and Tiffany are trampsing through hell, screaming each others' names, the movie itself has gone to hell. Seriously, we get all the clichés here. It's actually kind of admirable that they could fit it all in.Hellraiser II is a boring, confusing slideshow of gory images with nothing to link them together, nothing to push the story along and nothing to emotionally connect the viewer to the movie.

Cranham and Higgins deliver career defining performances.Hellbound: Hellraiser II, as far as I'm concerned, is a good sequel and remains probably the best entry in the series. It is more over the top, features more skin- swapping than any film I can think of and has Kenneth Cranham shouting about unnecessary surgical procedures: 'I recommend AMPUTATION!!' Brilliant. 'What was on today's agenda? Ah yes, EVISCERATION!'

Costume and makeup is an A+++ among horror movies!!! Dr. Channard, Pinhead and the Cenobites were made-up with great detail right down to their teeth. I can't figure out how some of the makeup was made. It looks so real including the lines in Pinhead and Dr. Channard's faces. Some of the movie was hoky like Julia losing skin, etc. The first half is intriguing because Channard brings Julia back to life and is sexually attracted to her. He had always had a special interest in the ""box"". Dr. Channard was the best actor in the film by far. The special effects, looking back now were primitive and laughable. That includes the animation of Dr. Channards protrusions from his arms. You can see the frame-by-frame motion of the animation which detracted from the realism. Don't let your mother or family members catch you watching this movie. They will try to pull you away from the TV set because of the gore and scare factor. Well done movie.

Luckily for fans of Pinhead and Co., Hellraiser creator Clive Barker, after the sequel was given the go-ahead, decided to expand on the ideas and characters of the first movie to ensure that Hellbound was more than just a case of 'more of the same.' Barker's plot outline and ideas were passed to writer Peter Atkins and Tony Randel was signed up to direct the sequel.Visually, Hellbound retains a similar look to the original movie with flashes of bright lighting and some strikingly macabre images - the sight of a skinless Julia, wrapped in pure white bandages is especially memorable. It's worth mentioning at this point that Hellbound is one of the most relentlessly gory films that this reviewer has ever seen, with hardly a minute passing without some kind of gore effect being splashed across the screen. The previously mentioned scene with the hospital inmate hacking away at himself with a razor will send even hardened gore hounds stomachs a-churning and splatter-fans will be delighted with the grue on display here.

162,searching-13860,Hellbound: Hellraiser II feels as much a fantasy picture as a horror film,10,22 January 2016,"Hellbound: Hellraiser II feels as much a fantasy picture as a horror film, and as such it works quite nicely. In terms of its representation of the practice of psychiatric medicine, the film has also got a strong anti-authoritarian stance, and it's certainly a very nicely photographed film. Through the character of Channard, and his reign over the mental hospital, Hellbound: Hellraiser II seems to offer an anti-psychiatry perspective to rival that of R D Laing. (This seems compounded in Barker's Nightbreed, 1990, the film that Barker loosened his grip on the reins of the Hellraiser sequel in order to direct.) The film's depiction of the mental hospital as a place of repression – where Kirsty is confined owing to the perception that her version of events cannot possibly be true and therefore must be suppressed – depicts psychiatry as having progressed little, if at all, since the Victorian era. This sense of psychiatry being stunted is partly communicated through the film's mise-en-scène and the depiction of Channard's psychiatric institution as existing within an old Nineteenth Century building. It's a depiction of a mental hospital that differs little from that of Mark Robson's Bedlam (1946).Channard is introduced performing invasive brain surgery on one of the patients at the hospital. He lords over the room, delivering a monologue as he drills into the patient's skull – an action which is mirrored later in the film when Leviathan, choosing to make a Cenobite of Channard, opts to have a device drill into Channard's skull and carry his body, thus allowing the Channard Cenobite to float above the ground. During the moment of brain surgery, Channard declares that 'The mind is a labyrinth, ladies and gentlemen; a puzzle. While the paths of the brain are plainly visible [] its destinations are unknown, its secrets still secret. And, if we are honest, it is the lure of the labyrinth that draws us to our chosen field, to unlock these secrets'. Channard's monologue ends by drawing fairly explicit comparisons between his rhetoric and that of the Nazis: Channard concludes by asserting that he and his colleagues must go further than their predecessors in the hope of finding 'ultimately, the final solution'. Channard's suggestion that the 'mind is a labyrinth' also implies that the journey into Leviathan's labyrinth later in the picture is, for the characters, also a journey into themselves.

Tony Randel directs this tale which follows Kirsty now living in a mental institution after the demise of her family - where, rather conveniently, the head Doctor (a wonderfully theatrical Kenneth Cranham) is a devoted occultist who resurrects Julia and unleashes the Cenobites once again.) Hellbound keeps things fresh by taking us to the Cenobite's labyrinthine world in its conclusion.

I thought they were almighty, and not letting some loony doctor slay them.So, other than ruining my own Hellraiser fantasy, it was a great movie. I' m only giving it five, because not staying true to Hellraiser #1. Remember its only my own opinion. >B=D~",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
165,murali00017,Boring dish with a lot of ugly sh#t!,2,24 May 2014,"First part was good because it had a plot and they stuck to it. Second part is a waste of time.In first part, Frank says to Kirsty, ""Come to daddy"". It was good because Frank's character was as such. He was addicted to sexual pleasures and a lot more. Copying that in second part, Julia says to Kirsty in one scene,""Come to mommy"". It looked so stupid and artificial.Julia's role was filled with holes and her acting was also like a hole. And there is Tiffany, who is supposed to be the mystery girl. The movie is not worth it to have this many puzzles or whatever the director may wanna call em' that is supposed to make the audience think. Come on! Seriously.. All that is in the movie is gore and some more gore clubbed with ugly s#it which has no connection to the plot.The reason original version of Hellraiser was good even with the gore and ugly sh#t was it was all included with the plot and nothing was unnecessary. But this isn't the case with the sequel. It looks like the movie itself was unnecessary and a waste of time. Forget the gore and the ugly sh#t!",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
166,waynerainy,The loneliest place anyone has been to,10,22 April 2006,"One of the best horror films i have seen. Watching this movie gave me the chills. It felt that it was the end of the world and hell is the only place left. The depiction of hell is really good in this movie. It is shown as a bleak, lonely place from which there is no escape. And the messengers from hell (Cenobites), headed by Pinhead are as good as ever plus you have The Doctor from (in) hell. One of the few sequels that has outdone the original movie. The last movie in the Hellraiser series worth watching. Pinhead (along with Freddy Kruger of Nightmare on Elm Street and Jason Voorhees of Friday, the 13th) is one of the best horror characters ever created. Definitely worth watching.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
167,natwebber,The strongest of all the sequels and the closest in spirit of the original.,10,30 January 2016,"There is a really good story in here and some really striking imagery.Tony Randel's positively dark attitude is one of the most prominent and uneasy characteristics of this sequel; the director claimed the film is so dark and bleak in tone as it reflected his state of mind at the time, and his outlook on the world. He utilises the same coldly forensic and unyielding approach to violence and suffering as Clive Barker did in the first film; only here it continues in a much more intensified manner. The film is rife with utterly disgusting , depressing and morbidly fascinating imagery.Dr Channard is an interesting enough character – there's potential in how we come to discover that he is just as obsessed in his own way as Frank Cotton was.The strongest of all the sequels and the closest in spirit of the original.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
168,judesmith-19067,This film is laughably awful,6,2 February 2020,"Not only half of the film complete nonsense, but the entire plot was basically a rehash of the first film, except after half way, everything gets infinitely worse and infinitely more stupid and nonsensical.Lastly, the only thing that was good about the first film, Pinhead and his merry gang of cenobytes, got completely destroyed by the most stupid looking horror villain I've ever seen. It was just laughably awful and stupid.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
169,forwardearth,Nothing about this holds up.,1,16 November 2019,"If you're thinking of revisiting this film in the 21st century, I strongly advise against it. The story is weaker than you remember, and the effects and production are worse than you can imagine.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
170,enfield-38978,Hellraiser II takes us to the greater depths of Madness,10,27 January 2016,"Hellraiser II takes us to the greater depths of Madness. All in all, this is another great film. Exciting, involving and relentless, it draws us into a world we wouldn't dare imagine, and leaves us loving it. Ashley Laurence (Kirsty) is a lot more watchable and charismatic than she was in Hellraiser, this time Kirsty is more assured. She wants to beat it. Another great actress is Imogen Boorman playing Tiffany, a damaged mute girl who obsesses over solving puzzles, she joins Laurence on this adventure.Claire Higgins returns as Julia even more evil , but the ultimate villain in this sequel is Kenneth Cranham as Dr. Channard, of course we get the return of Pinhead and his gash. Tony Randel surprises with this top-rate sequel, coming as close to understanding and recreating Clive Barker's nightmarish world as anyone ever has. Dark themes of obsession and human desire are ever present, expanding on the mythology behind the characters without betraying Barker's original intent. The labyrinthine sets a cold and empty vision of hell that is wrapped in personal torment rather than fire and brimstone. Christopher Young builds on his previous work with another eloquent score, adding a note of whimsical dark fantasy on top of the horror. One of the better Horror sequels",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
171,sanders-75286,We have eternity to know your flesh. Hellbound is an endless labyrinth of puzzles to be solved,10,4 February 2016,"Hellbound carries on immediately from the first Hellraiser and finds Kirsty in mental hospital where she attempts to reason with her doctors and encourage them that what she saw was indeed very real. Doctor MacRae (William Hope) seems to sympathise with Kirsty, while Doctor Channard (Kenneth Cranham) has his own ominous means for believing her.A highly interesting, deeply sadistic film that ties in nicely with its predecessor.What Hellbound does extremely well, is to build upon the world that was set out in the first film and gives the audience a sense that the events of Hellraiser had far more reach than first imagined.It continues the style and trend set by Clive Barker's original film. The S&M fetish remains, as does the high level of fantastical gore. Director Tony Randel even manages to create one scene, involving the bed which Hellraiser's Julia was murdered on, that is as horrifically brilliant and just as memorable as Frank's rebirth in the first film.Randel manages to pay respect to Barker's vision, while also moving the film into new territory, and shows us an impossible Hell, that has the demented vision of someone who views the world in an all too unkind light.Randel's vision of what the Cenobites call home is as brutal as one would expect, with a deliciously haunting atmosphere.The Film is an endless labyrinth of puzzles to be solved.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
172,chriswells-38016,A film that pushes the boundaries of its own depraved origins. In my opinion one of the best horror sequels ever made.,10,24 February 2016,"Making a horror sequel more often than not can produce something on par with and sometimes better than the original. The great thing with horror and fantasy is that you can go in fantastical directions and expand upon these limitless new dimensions. Such films as Dawn of the Dead, Evil Dead II and Aliens are prime examples of horror films that dared to be different and to many, are better and more original than the first films.Hellbound: Hellraiser II, the sequel to 1987's game changing original Hellraiser. A film that pushes the boundaries of its own depraved origins. In my opinion one of the best horror sequels ever made.The story takes place after the events of the first film.we see Kirsty (Ashley Laurence) committed to an asylum under the care of the classy yet perverse Dr Channard (played exquisitely by British stage actor Kenneth Cranham) who throughout the film establishes his character as one of the most twisted and memorable in horror cinema. Treat yourselves to this stunning version of a true horror classic. Arrow has given Hellbound a stunning 2K HD transfer. Another classic follow up to a masterpiece.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
173,mouth_michaels,twister? the wall?,5,15 July 2001,"Yuck yuck yuck!!!!  This movie screams of potential, but reeks of failure. There's way too much trying to be addressed in one movie, yet there's not enough to keep this movie interesting. I loved the special effects, and the concept was frikin' amazing but thats about it.  There's a lot of dialogue which sounds so damn important, but in the end - - - - NOPE.  This movie doesn't follow the rules of the original or Barker's ""The Hellbound Heart"" damn it!!! (that girl gets skin pretty quick) Don't bother with this movie unless you wanna see a bunch of amazing special effects. It's fun and cool, but ""fun and cool"" don't make a movie great!  If you wanna see a good Hellraiser story then rent ""Inferno"" instead.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
174,nightshade777,Pretty good sequel!,8,25 May 2006,"I was a big fan of the original Hellraiser and Pinhead to my opinion is one of the greatest (and coolest) characters in Horror history. So I was a little frightened that the sequel would be nothing but a mess. But I pretty enjoyed the film! It is strongly linked to the original, most of the main characters appear here too, something I really missed in Pt. 3, cause it adds to the atmosphere since you're somehow linked to Kirstey. I liked the idea that Pinhead's story is discovered here a bit, that you see who he was in his human days and how he came to become a big number in hell. It somehow makes him more ""sympathic"" if this word can be used here. The movie has a very dark and gripping atmosphere, and the characters are very good, especially the mad doctor and, of course, Pinhead. But the flick starts to get really great when Kirstey enters hell! The whole place is shot in fascinating, dark colors and the setting of the whole labyrinth is great! Like a dark masterpiece of architecture. The showdowns are also very well done, especially when Pinhead discovers his ""human"" side and helps Kirstey to escape the mad doctor. After all, a very good sequel, in some parts even better than Part 1 and definitely better than Part 3!",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
175,peterbaugh,Better than the original.,9,11 April 2017,"The first two Hell Raiser movies are my favorites. The music helps make the movie for me. Great music. Just a very cool movie. Scary enough for some I guess, I just like the acting and story line. Not gonna give any spoilers - just watch. A cousin told me about these movies a long time ago - I thought, whoa, is he messed up? But then I watched and paid attention... the more I watched, the more I liked these films. Give it a few tries and do not blink or you will miss part of the plot! Remember, it is ""only"" a movie... You will probably like the ending :-)",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
176,austinpwillcut,Make sure you watch the unrated cut!,9,16 June 2016,"Hellraiser 2 is a worthy sequel to Clive Barker's Hellraiser and will probably make you barf! Especially the unrated cut where you see a patient slice himself up in very graphic form and was cut drastically for the theatrical release back in '88. The R version is hard to find(thankfully!) so the unrated is easy to get and the only way to watch this sick and twisted horror classic! The MPAA are stupid and don't know the real art of filmmaking and could care less as long as they can sanitize real art and laugh about it! This movie we find out pinhead was a WW1 captain and the cenobites finally realize who they were in their past life before Leviathan. We see Frank and Julia again, the gore is much worse than the first and pushes boundaries, which makes this a good sequel and worth owning! Hellbound is a great follow up but just be sure to avoid the cut version because it is not the same movie as the uncut and the unrated version I consider one of the greatest horror films of all times! Your suffering will be legendary, even in Hell!",Hellbound - Hellraiser II

178,chameleoncrow,Incoherent Mess...,1,15 September 2004,""" A worthy sequel"", "" Better than the original"", ""A great horror movie""....To those people who share these sentiments, i'd like to ask you... WHAT MOVIE WERE YOU WATCHING AND WHAT DRUGS WERE YOU ON?This movie is an utter incoherent mess of a nightmare. I consider myself to be a person who is very generous with compliments especially when it comes to movies, and i especially like my horror movies with extra gore,and i loved the original Hellraiser. But this sequel is just terrible in every aspect.First of all, The direction of the film is horrible, with scenes and sequences that were just messily and illogically slabbed together, and illogical actions by the characters(even for a horror movie)is commonplace. The plot is as plain and simple as a blank piece of paper, which is only prolonged by the seemingly never ending wanderings of two poorly built characters with irrational motivation in the corridors of hell. It seems like the story is simply made up along the way as the movie progresses, With ""rules"" suddenly changing...a reflection of weak foundation.The special Effects were a significant step down from the original, even though they were more attempts at it in this sequel. The Effect with Dr. channard looked especially cheap even for the 80's. This movie totally destroys what i feel made the first Hellraiser successful, Which is the mystique and the Darkness of the Cenobites and the Box, by over-exposure of ""hell"" and by over-revealing the secrets of the cenobites(such as how one becomes a cenobite). This takes away the mysterious, menacing factor to them, and makes them almost vulnerable. What were once strong, menacing characters are now just confused children with amnesia.And then some scenes are just corny and lame, such as Kirsty wearing Julia's Skin, which is a weak attempt at a twist; and the lame attempt at a cool ending with the pointless rotating post scene. Whether you're a fan of The HellRaiser series or not, I can't seriously believe that a person could say that he/she think this movie is even close to being decent. Quite possibly the worst sequel of all time. This movie alone could decimate the entire Hellraiser franchise.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
179,morrisgreg28,I Thought This Film Was Downright Terrible,2,25 May 2013,"So, two seconds of history here: I enjoyed Hellraiser, love Clive Barker (and was aware that he did not direct this sequel, but was the Executive Producer) and was up for seeing the second installment of the series that according to a lot of reviews went downhill AFTER this film in the third chapter. I HATED THIS MOVIE! The entire film is just references to the first film and even has horrific elements that are ripped off the original . I felt the storyline was paper thin and completely divorced itself of the depth of The Hellbound Heart story on which the first film was based.An interview with Clive Barker about how excited he was with the release of this put me over the top in my decision to see it; well, that was a huge source of disappointment! Im sorry, but you just can't do what this film does. The only really original aspects of this piece are the gory special effects. Good job on those! Only hardcore genre fans will be able to walk away with any feeling of satisfaction, in my opinion, from seeing a little over an hour and a half of nonsense plot line that adds NOTHING to the original story, scenes of people being ripped apart and repeated plot twists from the first film. Maybe Tony Randel should take up smoking pot or something for ideas, because after this fiasco, I'm staying away from his other films for at least a minute.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
180,perit,Complete and utter waste of time!,2,27 December 2005,"Time has caught up with this movie, which really reeks. It's so worthless that it's hard to even describe. I hated every minute of it and i'm usually very positive to horror movies of the past like ""A nightmare on Elm street"" or ""Poltergeist"". But this had nothing. I think it sucked 1988 too, but maybe not as bad as it does if you see it today. I mean some of the effects used in this flick were a bit Star wars, but that has been done before and George Lucas did it much better in the 70's than Clive Barker would manage. Not even if he got private tutoring from Lucas himself. Really lame. Don't see it. Any other movie will do.",Hellbound - Hellraiser II
