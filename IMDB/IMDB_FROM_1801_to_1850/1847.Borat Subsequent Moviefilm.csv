0,kosmasp,To the point,7,28 October 2020,"As far as I remember, this seems more focused than the first Borat movie. Though I have to admit, I have to rewatch the previous entry in the Borat world. Some things almost seem improbable (like what did he tell people, that they would actually not just go along with some of th stuff but also say really despicably things?), others may seem devious to say the least.One of the biggest things of the movie is the Rudy Giuliani story. Tucking in your shirt becomes a whole new issue ... now whether you believe him or not (the whole thing should make you feel like a creepy voyeur), Rudy has been, said and done worse as what we actually see in the movie. But since Sascha Baron Cohen could not see exactly what was happening, he may have (coitus) interrupted a bit too quick - for those who are still not convinced what was going on ... or rather what was about to happen.Generally speaking you should not be easily offended. And while there are blows to almost everything and everyone, it is mostly the ridiculous Trump cult that will be outraged the most - snowflakes and all that. Of course if you are a fan of his, you already gave me a negative feedback - I can live with that. I hope I don't have to live with more Potus Trump any longer ...",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm
1,Sleepin_Dragon,We needed this.,9,25 October 2020,"Well done Sacha Baron Cohen, it's been many years since we last saw Borat torment all manner of people.I was keen to have a look what those in Kazakhstan thought of it, and it seems the reaction was a little different to the last movie. They perhaps realise now that this was perhaps a pop at an altogether more famous administration further West.Oh my days the Mike Pence speech, the rally, there were times when I was cringing, but you can't help laugh, the reactions are the best part. The scene with Rudy Giuliani is perhaps the moment where your jaw will drop to its lowest point.I thought Maria Bakalova was pretty terrific as Tutar.I've read some of the reviews, and I think people are missing the point, this is satire, we are absolutely crying out for satire, fun poked at everyone, particularly during this turbulent time.Shocking, but funny. 9/10.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm
2,classicsoncall,"""Wawaweewa, high five!""",1,9 April 2021,"If I could use four letter expletives to describe this movie I would, but then my review would never get posted. I'm trying to decide if the film was disgustingly stupid or stupidly disgusting, but either way works for me. Let me ask something, how is it that people like Sacha Baron Cohen never get called out for his exploitation of women and demonstrably misogynistic and juvenile behavior? Wait, wait, I already know the answer to that, it's pretty easy to understand and I'm sure you can figure it out. And I'm not even coming at this from a political angle, because for all the negative reviews on this board calling the picture an exercise in Trump bashing, he also got in some good shots against Obama and the Clintons, so at least he was an equal opportunity idiot here. The scene where Borat does the vagina dance, wait, excuse me, the 'vagine' dance with daughter Tutar (Maria Bakalova) sets about the lowest standard in humor that I can come up with, but then again, I generally stay away from what I like to describe as fodder for the lowest common denominator. I have a t-shirt that states 'Losing Faith in Humanity, One Person at a Time'. ""Borat Subsequent Moviefilm"" is one of the reasons why.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm
3,jboothmillard,Borat Subsequent Moviefilm,5,16 November 2020,"The original Borat is a hilarious mix of documentary and set-up prank comedy, but I had no idea until I saw the trailer that there was going to be a sequel, I just hoped it would be as funny. Basically, journalist Borat Sagdiyev (Golden Globe winning Sacha Baron Cohen, also writing and producing) has caused his home country of Kazakhstan humiliation with his film, Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan. He has spent the last fourteen years of a life sentence imprisoned in a forced-labour camp. But the country's Premier, Nursultan Nazarbayev (Dani Popescu), releases him, giving him the mission to deliver Kazakh Minister of Culture Johnny the Monkey to President Donald Trump to redeem the nation. But he cannot get close to Trump, so he instead opts to deliver the monkey to Vice President Mike Pence. Borat is transported in a cargo ship and arrives in Texas, but his celebrity status in America means he has disguise himself to maintain a low profile. He has no monkey to deliver however, when he discovers his teenage daughter Tutar (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Maria Bakalova), born during his time inprisoned, has smuggled herself into the animal's crate and it has been eaten alive. The plan is changed to deliver Tutar as a gift for Pence, or Borat will be executed. Tutar receives a makeover, and she and Borat learn about etiquette. They attend a debutante ball, where Tutan has her period, and her menstrual blood is prominently displayed during a father and daughter dance. Discovering that Pence is close, Borat disguises himself as Trump in an attempt to offer Tutar to him, but he is thrown out be security. Informing Nazarbayev of what has happened, he is ordered to return to Kazakhstan to face execution. But realising they can offer Tutar to someone else close to Trump, she suggests they go to find Rudy Giuliani (Razzie winner for Worst Supporting Actor), Trump's lawyer. Tutar contemplates surgery to have enlarged breasts and is left with professional babysitter Jeanise Jones. But Tutar realises many of Borat's teachings about American culture and views of women and femininity are wrong, seeing women driving cars, and masturbating for the first time. Tutar decides not to get the surgery and lashes out at Borat for keeping her oppressed her whole life. She also wrongly believes that the Holocaust did not happen and leaves her father in anger. Borat is devastated, but confirms that the Holocaust is true after meeting two Jewish survivors who treat him with kindness after he was suicidal. Overjoyed, Borat goes looking for Tutar, but finds the streets deserted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He quarantines with two men who have strong views on American politics. They help him find Tutar; she has become a reporter and will be covering a March for Our Rights rally in Olympia, Washington. At the rally, after Borat performs onstage in disguise, he and his daughter reconcile, and she agrees to meet Giuliani, arranging an interview, but without Borat joining her. Talking to the babysitter, Borat realises he loves his daughter too much, and intervenes during Tutar's interview with Giuliani which has proceeded to a bedroom. Borat decides to face execution in Kazakhstan and Tutar promises to go with him. Returning to his home country, Borat is shocked to find he will not be executed. Nazarbayev reveals he is was injected with with SARS-CoV-2 and went around America to spread the virus as retaliation against the USA for making Kazakhstan a laughingstock, making him patient zero of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Borat has recorded Nazarbayev's admission, he and Tutar blackmail him into giving Borat his job back and changing Kazakhstan's misogynistic laws. Three months later, Tutar and Borat are a reporting team. Also starring Tom Hanks as himself. Cohen returns to form as his outrageous and idiotic alter-ego and dons some terrific and handy disguises, including and Bakalova is an up-and-coming talent as his innocent daughter brought on the journey who is discovering herself. It is fair to say that some of the over-the-top jokes are similar in style and delivery to the first film, but you cannot help but find yourself laughing at most of them. It is perhaps not as well-written and thought-out as the original, and the themes of the Trump presidency and the necessary inclusion of the coronavirus are less interesting, but it is not a bad mocumentary comedy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay, it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy, and it won the Razzie for Worst Screen Combo for Rudy Giuliani and his pants zipper. Sacha Baron Cohen was number 8 for Ali G on The 100 Greatest TV Characters, Borat was number 24 on The 100 Greatest Funny moments, along with Bruno at number 77 and Ali G at number 6, Borat was number 17 on The World's Greatest Comedy Characters, with Ali G at number 6, and Sacha Baron Cohen (as Ali G) was number 12 on Britain's Favourite Comedian. Worth watching!",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm
4,BA_Harrison,He's still got it.,7,25 October 2020,"Comedy sequels that come long after the original have a history of being pants: Blues Brothers 2000, Dumb and Dumber To, Anchorman 2, Zoolander 2, Bill & Ted Face The Music, to name a few. This belated follow up to Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (2006) could easily have followed suit, the novelty of the character and the format having worn off over the years, but while it's not quite as brilliant as the first film, there are still plenty of genuinely inspired, laugh out loud moments that make it worth a watch.I defy anyone not to bust a gut at the father/daughter dance scene at the debutante's ball, or be amazed at the sight of New York mayor Rudy Giuliani behaving rather inappropriately in the company of Borat's pretty daughter Tutar (a winning performance by Maria Bakalova). These two scenes alone qualify Borat star Sascha Baron Cohen as one of the most daring and original comedy talents of this millennium. Some of the gags don't quite hit the mark, and more of the scenes feel staged than in the original (although the more I research it, the more I am amazed to find was for real), but the good definitely outweighs the bad, with plenty of cutting satire and bold swipes at the Trump administration. Other highlights include Borat searching for porn at an electronics store, the visit to a pro-life clinic, Tutar explaining how she touched her vagin without having her hand bitten off, and Borat dressed as a Jew to visit a synagogue.7/10. Time will tell whether this one has the staying power of the first film (which I still find funny after several viewings).",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm
5,paul_haakonsen,Was this a necessity to make?...,5,23 October 2020,"While ""Borat Subsequent Moviefilm: Delivery of Prodigious Bribe to American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"" is a watchable and at times funny movie, it was not really as entertaining as the 2006 ""Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"" movie.Granted, I am not much of a fan of Sacha Baron Cohen, but I was given the chance to sit down and watch the 2020 sequel movie, so of course I did so.I will say that there were a handful of scenes in the movie that were good for a laugh, and even also a couple of cringeworthy scenes, but the overall of the movie just doesn't stack up to compare to the first movie, which was way more funny and cringeworthy.This 2020 movie is definitely a movie that will be a win with fan of Sacha Baron Cohen, no doubt about that. But for the average movie viewer, I think the comedy and the movie as a whole will fall short.Personally I didn't really see the need for a sequel to the 2006 movie. But since we were given one, it was a shame that it wasn't much more of a stronger movie experience. I mean, it just felt sort of half-hearted most of the time, as if Sacha Baron Cohen was playing it safe and just running on auto-pilot.While the movie was watchable, it was not a movie that impressed me much. My rating of this 2020 sequel lands on a very mediocre five out of ten stars.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm
6,grantss,"Hilariously funny, in spells",7,24 October 2020,"It has been 14 years since journalist Borat Sagdiyev embarrassed the nation of Kazakhstan with his visit to America and resulting documentary. He has spent those 14 years in a gulag but is now being released. The Premier of Kazakhstan has an important task for him: return to America and bribe the US Vice President in order that Kazakhstan regain favour.The first Borat film, released in 2006, was brilliant. Spinning off Borat, a secondary character in the TV series Da Ali G Show, into his own movie, writer-actor Sacha Baron Cohen created a hilariously funny film that combined candid comedy with staged skits. The success of the candid scenes was almost entirely due to the off-the-charts chutzpah and nerve of Cohen. Not only funny, the movie also made some interesting social observations, especially in demonstrating the superficiality of modern society.This film is the first Borat movie or release of any kind since the 2006 film. The fact that Cohen even decided to make it is interesting as you would think you can only make a candid film about a particular character once: they're bound to get recognised the second time round (even after a 14-year break).This was my fear before watching this: surely Cohen can't get away with it a second time? However, I needn't have worried. Through disguises and picking on people who've never heard of Borat, Cohen manages to replicate the candidness and anonymity of the first movie. The other major positive is here he isn't working alone: Maria Bakalova does a great job in playing Borat's daughter Tutar, getting many of the candid scenes and taking the pressure off Cohen/Borat.The result is a film that is, in spells, as funny as the original. Some great laugh-out-loud moments.However, it isn't as consistently funny as the 2006 film, with some scenes that miss the mark. There are still some good social observations but they aren't as many or as profound as in the original.Overall, very entertaining and well worth the watch, especially if you enjoyed the 2006 film.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm
7,deloudelouvain,"Great movie, awesome humor, with like usual easy targets to play with.",9,5 November 2020,"I'm amazed by the pretty high score the movie gets. 6.9 isn't bad at all, as I was expecting Republicans being all over this trying to keep the score down. I guess at one point they just don't want to watch Borat's movies anymore as they just can't stand how ridicule they look. You can say it's all fake, which it isn't by the way, apart from one scene or two, but the truth is just that it's very easy to find Republicans to make fun of, they're just an easy target as their ideas and beliefs are just so dumb you would be a fool to not take advantage of that. Sacha Baron Cohen understands that like no other and proves it again with his second Borat movie. I loved the first one and I loved this one. It might be shocking to some but does it really matter when it's that funny? It shows some perverted Republicans like Giuliani, he can deny whatever he wants but the images speak for themselves. Sacha Baron Cohen as Borat is this time assisted by his daughter played by Maria Bakalova, both did a great job playing those characters. I guess his next mission will be making a third Borat movie, which will be difficult to fool those Republicans again, or is it that difficult to fool idiots?",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm
8,blanbrn,Far out funny parody from Mr. Borat!,5,25 February 2021,"Borat does it again as with his latest film he's on it trying to say something with his messages the best he can. It's like he's been chosen as the leader of his native Kazakhstan as visiting America he finds out about the culture and aspects from ways of life to it's politics. The scenes are blunt, outspoken, and just downright funny as his daughter is even on board yet all of this is at and during the COVID 19 pandemic! Overall watch this film it's different as it may not be everyone's cup of tea still it's a good push the envelope go against the grain kind of thing from the funny Borat(Sacha Baron Cohen).",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm
9,DKosty123,Political Sci-Fi Machine Gunned By The Mob?,2,3 December 2020,"There is nothing here laugh out loud funny. In fact, there are scenes which are kind of sad. If your nuts about Cohen (what kind of nuts they must be) you will love movie. If your intelligent, and see that both parties are literally lampooned and destroyed in a short time, you might understand this one. If you like seeing Borat in Trump suit, you might find it cute. If your from Eastern Europe, you will find it to be the second insult.This movie is all over the place. Maria Bakalova as daughter Tutar Sagdiyev is the anchor on this movie. 10 Writers including Cohen put together a movie that is really a random bunch of juvenile punch lines that lose meaning after a while. Without Tutar is fallas apart like cheap suit sent to wrong dry cleaner. The hard part is watching it in one sitting, so I broke it up into 2 parts. That because the first part bored me to sleep so I shut it off before I went into trance.Borat with all the costumes and disguises throughout becomes annoying more often then entertaining. Most of the entertainment comes from the people around him, but even that is strained at best. Some of the folks appear to play up to him deliberately like they know they are in movie and want to be famous. I will only spoil one political joke in a minute. If you want to see someone try and make fun of covid-19 which is not a laughing matter, the second half of this film is for you. The first half is nap time.Very near the end of the film, there is politically correct statement which if viewer is awake will shock them. I know it must have shocked any main stream media folks who stayed awake for it. I did 2 parts and it almost got by me because the message is so quick you have to look very hard for it. This message runs against the current ""Radical Activist"" message the main stream media tends to push at everyone and shows how random the movie is in targeting. I put message below and if you have watched it and missed this one, go back to late in movie and you will find it.""All Lives Matter""",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

11,cherold,Every bit as crazy and pointed as the original,8,28 November 2020,"Sacha Baron Cohen doesn't seem to have been in a rush to make a sequel to his hit 2006 movie, but when he got around to it he created a crazed masterpiece. Once again a Kazakhstan filmmaker comes to the United States and a very bizarre culture clash ensued. Once again the fictional story is furthered by people tricked into thinking they are involved in something other than a Cohen film.This time around Borat is joined by his daughter, Tutar, played by Maria Bakalova with the same mad, fearless verve as Cohen. They both start the movie believing that women are useless animals who should be kept in cages, but exposure to America gives Tutar an interesting story arc.

13,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Amazon revives Baron Cohen's comedy icon to great effect,9,9 November 2020,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningYears after he unwittingly caused his native country national humiliation, and was tortured by Premier Nazarbayev (Dani Popescu), Kazahkstani reporter Borat Sagdiyev (Sacha Baron Cohen) is handed the chance to redeem himself, when the Ministry of Tourism once again sends him to America, to deliver a famed pet monkey to President Trump to smooth relations. However, upon his arrival, he discovers his daughter Tutar (Maria Bakalava) stowed away, and has eaten the monkey to survive. Borat, in his wisdom, decides she must be offered in place of the monkey, only to be taken on a journey of discovery.Nearly fifteen years ago, the original Borat film became a massive cult hit, on the back of the hilarity derived from a dim witted foreigner's unbelievably ridiculous cultural lack of awareness. However, the events of the last four years, with the election of Trump and the present coronavirus pandemic, have created an environment more mad than anything Borat himself could cause, and so a typically (in this day and age) belated sequel to the original film was just begging to be made.While Baron Cohen may have been trying to branch out into more serious dramatic fare in recent times, he will always be mainly associated with the comedy characters that made his name, of which Borat may be the most successful. Although it may feel more timely and relevant this time, debut feature length director Jason Woliner still follows the same formula that made the original work quite so well, with an unrelenting assault of outrageous, boundary pushing belly laughs, that may not come together and work quite as well as the original, but is certainly not far off it.Mainly, in these dark and uncertain times, one thing we all need more than anything is some humour and light, and the hilariously unaware Kazahkstani madman fits that bill just fine (and might shed some more light on it all than you might have thought. ) ****",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm
14,ElMaruecan82,"A Biased Big Joke Whose Premeditated Punchline is ""Now Vote""...",5,13 January 2021,"In 2006, Borat Sagdyev was like a fresh wind sweeping over the dust of political correctness. Through his 'ignorant' stances, his grotesque displays of anti-semitism, his views on feminists and other horrific comments on society, his journey across America featured a patchwork of situations that invited us to laugh at serious matters or at least stop reading them too seriously. The film was gross, vulgar, trashy but in its twisted way, invited us to laugh at the things that made us angry. ""Borat Subsequent Moviefilm"" is different because it invites us to laugh at the people that make us angry. And that's a double mistake.It's a mistake because our world changed significantly in the span of 14 years: we've gotten more polarized and divided than ever, one couldn't criticize the policy of a certain president without being accused of social justice, one couldn't even acknowledge a few good things about him without being called a bigot. If anything, that obsessional need of labelling people, an ugly trait of our social-network-driven era, should have been the subject of Borat's mockery; instead, Sacha Baron Cohen takes sides and pretends us to teach us right from wrong.By doing that, I'm afraid his movie stops being a satire, it becomes a ""J'accuse"" that alienates him from half his potential viewership. I can hear the objections: why should Cohen be deprived from his right for bias? Spike Lee attacked the 'orange man' more or less frontally in his recent movies, so did Michael Moore with the Bush administration. And yes, comedy is a powerful tool. But think about that: Cohen had a character who was all about mocking the worst of human psyche: racism, bigotry, ignorance but never at the expense of people. So he stands up to a person, a party: Republicans, and a certain portion of American population that happens to believe in certain values. I'm no American but one thing I know is that foolishness is equally divided and the role of entertainment is not to lecture us about who's right or wrong.And I mean for its own sake. I wish I could laugh to each of Borat's insolent stunts, but some were so diluted in the political motive that they lost their charm, that little flavor that made the first film so irresistible. This is not a mockumentary, it's a hit-mission, a big joke of a film whose only punchline is ""now vote"". Cohen chose his side and he's entitled to, as are other viewers to feel insulted. 2020 was the year of a great ethnic divide to which even members of the Black community responded that all lives matered. But when Cohen replaced the infamous ""Running"" game with a caricature of a Yankee woman carrying that slogan in a WalMart T-shirt. The shortcut couldn't have been less obvious: it's evil to believe that all lives matter.The other problem is with Borat's arc. In the first film, he attacked women and Jews, and the sequel was his opportunity to make amends for his sins. There's a touching scene where he hugs a Holo caust survivor realizing that she was a normal human being after all. Was I moved? No, maybe my heart is made of stone or maybe it is that Borat was so ridiculous to begin with that turning him into a nice guy was like validating the very accusations pointed against the first film. The scene with the Jewish couple in ""Borat"" was enough, they were nice people who offered him a warm welcome and yet he was so scared he left the house. The point was made in a subtler way. But subtlety isn't exactly that film's strongest suit. It goes all the same with the feminist angle, and I also have a problem with the character of Tutar.Yes, it's a nice addition and Bulgarian actress Maria Bakalova is believable as the daughter of the Kazak journalist who grew up in a barn and suffered 15 years of anti-female brainwashing. That she evolves and discovers that it was all a lie and become a good journalist was an interesting start but did she need to look like a SNL star impersonating Hillary Clinton at the end? Didn't it occur to Cohen that her becoming blonde, sexy, attractive turned her into the kind of role model that's not necessarily every women's cup of tea?Maria Bakalova did a decent performance, I loved her cute smile with her face stuck on a shop window but I was sad that her character was only reduced to a feminist message and a couple of gross jokes that will please the macho guys who pretend women can only be funny when they mention their biological organs or their cycle (know what I mean). Much more, I regret she didn't realize she was being exploited to frame a politician, encouraging some young girls to deviate from saner ambitions and use sexiness as a tool to destroy careers, so much for the empowering message. Yes the film will certainly earn her accolades and even an Oscar nod, but I don't like the way Cohen her character was used, if not herself.There are a few good moments, the opening was hilarious, the nod to Azamat, the homage to ""The Usual Suspects"", the final twist rooted in our Covid-stricken reality. I'm pretty sure the film will be regarded as an era-defining one, but it's also governed by the ugly binary of our world and the rush to finish before elections. How ironic that a film about some propaganda journalist turns out to be a sort of propaganda by itself.Jonathan Miller once said that politicians have a responsibility in the way they use the charisma of their office to tell people what can be appropriate responses, it's called performative utterance. I'm afraid Cohen is guilty of that too, using his own comedic charisma. Not nice...",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

You would think, given the potential targets, (Trump, Covid), this could be the best Borat film yet and yet a lot of gags fall flat. Yes, i laughed and loudly every now and then but nowhere near as often as I thought I would. Still, ""Borat Subsequent Moviefilm"", to give it its short title, (and that title in itself reeks of desperation), is still worth seeing thanks to a brilliant, star-making turn from Maria Bakalova as Borat's daughter, Tutar.The very thin excuse for a plot has Borat revisiting America with said daughter in tow and a plan to offer her as a gift to VP Mike Pence, (yes, that's about as original as it gets). Needless to say, Pence isn't interested though his appearance does mark one of the film's few inspired moments so the sights are set on Rudy Giuliani who is either even dumber than we thought or a rather good sport for going along with it. The candid-camera style sequences still work but much of this looks rehearsed and the wonderful Miss Bakalova deserves better. Will she deserve the Oscar should she win?

I loved first Borat movie because it made fun of women and now when they praise women they are losing main point and attention...

17,Pjtaylor-96-138044,King in the castle; this time with princess.,6,21 February 2021,"'Borat Subsequent Moviefilm (2020)' is about as successful as the first flick, though it still suffers from similar issues. What mainly sets it apart from its predecessor is the fact that its characters are actually afforded some growth; not only are their backwards views satirised, they're actively challenged. As usual, the affair is at its best when it calls attention to - via poking fun at - the various political problems within that plague the USA. Shot on the sly, it manages to tell a remarkably cohesive and relevant story even in an ever-evolving political landscape. It's often funny (probably more consistently so than the first), with newcomer Bakalova holding her own against stalwart Cohen. There are also some real jaw-dropping moments, for better or worse, and a segment that actually gives some sickening insight into what happens behind certain locked doors. Plus, a final reveal brings everything together in an absurd yet almost side-splitting way. Of course, the film is basically just a series of skits. Its emotional drive, though surprisingly well-done, doesn't hold as much weight as you'd like it to (though you'll probably give it a bit of slack). Several of its skits are a little hazy as to whether they're punching up or down, too. Still, this is a shockingly good follow-up to a fifteen-year-old film. 6/10",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm
18,dromasca,Borat the Sequel,7,24 October 2020,"'Borat Subsequent Moviefilm' or for short 'Borat 2' directed by Jason Woliner is the most surprising production I've seen so far in this strange year, a proof that interesting films can appear despite or even due to the pandemic. The film is a sequel to the first 'Borat' made 14 years ago, resuming the American adventures of the pseudo-Kazakh character invented and played by Sacha Baron Cohen in the America of 2020. One of the things that happened during this time was was the series 'Who Is America' in which Cohen practiced and perfected scenarios in which the imaginary stereotypes of the characters meet real people, some stereotypically banal, others at the political or religious extremes of American society. The premises are farcical until the confrontations of characters and ideas make them seem painfully real. Satire is all the sharper as the characters Cohen / Borat encounters become more involved in their own roles, and those are the instances when comic effects are most successful and satire is devastating. However, the surprise effect is missing, not only that the formula is the same as in the original 'Borat', but also some of the comic effects (for example using 'exotic' languages) are repeated, and in almost any category the comparison with the original is unfavorable.'Borat 2' has about ten screenwriters (including Cohen), and that feels like it, because the film looks like a succession of scenes that can be viewed as separate comic clips. The film takes the risk of upsetting just about everyone and manages to do so in full, though probably unevenly, because the political orientation of the authors is clear. Almost anyone who wants or can't avoid feeling offended will find reasons to be so in this film, but especially adepts of political correctness and those who do not believe that political, social, character satire can afford saying anything or almost anything in a movie. The novelty introduced in the pretext of the film is the character of Borat's daughter played by the Bulgarian actress Maria Bakalova. The 15-year-old girl destined to be delivered as a 'gift' for bribing politicians offers the opportunity to expand satire in the #Me Too space, but the topic gets a Borat treatment here as well. The melodramatic line of action about the relationship between father and daughter, although a bit conventional, did not hurt I believe, on the contrary, it added a necessary emotional counterpoint in the succession of comic scenes. Sacha Baron Cohen also adopts a series of disguises justified by the fact that the character Borat has an already famous physiognomy created in the original film. Both Cohen and Bakalova immerse themselves with talent and courage in environments that risk becoming hostile at any time, especially if and when they understand that they have become the subject of a filmed satirical prank. They also do not avoid confrontations with the top of American politicians, and the results on the screen are interesting, debatable, but of a comic that cannot be denied.The disguises are not perfect, I had the impression that the mascara is almost always thick, the costumes are beyond credibility, and that these imperfections are intentional, as if to give an additional but unused chance to those involved to understand the context. Jokes of all kinds and to all tastes abound, including in the use of languages. 'Kazakhstan' is filmed on location in Romania and its inhabitants speak Romanian. Borat speaks Hebrew and his daughter answers in Bulgarian. The comic effect is inevitable, amplified if you understand these languages. Being a Romanian and Hebrew speaker, I was able to enjoy a large part of the 'foreign' dialogues. But not all gags work just as well, and some of them are complete misses. The unsuspecting heroes provide moments of comedy but also of unexpected emotion (like in the synagogue scene). At its best moments, the film manages to create a aggressive and substantial comedy. At others, however, the humor is tendentious, repetitive or simply flat. Sacha Baron Cohen did not invent the 'mockumentary' but with the first 'Borat' he achieved one of his greatest successes, perhaps the greatest so far in the history of the genre. 'Borat 2' is a sequel that tries to repeat this success but is not very successful.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm
19,Cineanalyst,Make Better But Still Stupid Moviefilm,3,2 November 2020,"This is better than the first ""Borat"" (2006) movie. Sacha Baron Cohen seems to have learned two important lessons from the first overrated prank video. One, critics seemed to expect the movie to be a satire or an actual coherent commentary on something, which the first ""Borat"" wasn't, but some seemed to think it was. ""Borat Subsequent Moviefilm"" picks a real target for its pranking, as opposed to a haphazard assemblage of spouting misogyny and racism with drunk frat boys, interfering with a local TV news station, destroying store merchandise, or randomly accosting people as before. He also defecated beside Trump Tower. From those humble beginnings, the exploitation of Trump politics this time around is far more concerted. The pandemic fits right in with this, too.Second, there seems to be less of Cohen humiliating, sexually harassing and chasing people. Indeed, some chase his Borat early on. Maybe there was less of him misleading and ambushing people, too, which may result in fewer lawsuits than followed in the wake of his first obnoxious tour. Filming a scene in what appears to be a public restroom, including one person's face being blurred out, indicating his lack of consent, is an exception and one instance of the series' continued toilet humor. I'm far less concerned over him interrupting a CPAC speech by Vice President Mike Pence or ambushing former New York mayor turned Russian-misinformation peddler Rudy Giuliani. One of my biggest complaints with the first movie was that he evidently included celebrity Pamela Anderson in on his joke--obviously, as he'd have gone to prison for that stunt otherwise--while he made fools of everyday people. Here, that's largely reversed, as President Trump's lackeys are heckled whereas at least some scenes with non-public figures are suspect of having been staged. Trump supporters, white supremacists and QAnon conspiracy theorists at one rally are an exception, but that does fit into the overall anti-Trump thesis.""Borat"" didn't work as satire or social commentary, either, due to Borat spouting more bigoted, homophobic, sexist and racist garbage than everyone else in the movie combined, and he did it in the disguise of an insulting characterization of someone from Kazakhstan. That's surely the reason the sequel includes some nauseating schmaltz regarding his relationship with his daughter. Borat learns to be not so anti-Semitic and hateful of women so as to punch harder at the right-wing political scene. Oh, it still hardly works, and the comedy remains juvenile, but it's an improvement.Hard to say it's a successful political takedown when Borat is lectured to by a supposed QAnon nut on sexual equality, or when he walks into a synagogue in an anti-Semitic costume. The Giuliani interview, the biggest coup of the picture, in particular, is a frustrating botched opportunity. I guess, at least, they get him to spout off about some conspiracy theory regarding the origins of the pandemic and, then, parody that and the QAnon junk rather humorously with the twist in the style of ""The Usual Suspects"" (1995). It's reminiscent of the better work ""The Daily Show"" and ""The Colbert Report,"" or Cohen himself, used to do by letting interviewees sink themselves. But, alas, that's short lived as Borat jumps out to scare Giuliani off. That many seem to focus on Giuliani with his hand in his pants instead of his ridiculous answers on the pandemic is quite indicative of the misplaced appreciation some seem to have for this series. Cohen sabotaged the key moment of his own movie. How asinine.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm
20,851222,The ending saved it,7,13 July 2021,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Borat Subsequent Moviefilm"" (2020) was a mixed bag for me for a most part, but ending was great and therefore it kinda saved this movie. I liked the first movie i think more eventually. That one was more original. And in this one many of the jokes can look bizarre and even tasteless, but if you liked first one, you still probably enjoy this one because its more or less the same stuff. I'm not a biggest fan of Sacha Baron Cohen's sense of humor, but he is a very good actor - a great one.Overall, the hilarious ending which i won't spoil kind of saved it for me. This movie is exactly what you can expect from Borat, although it was put together very well if you think about it. Stupid, but fun more or less and it has it's point.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm
21,ironhorse_iv,This comedy movie was mostly nice.,7,25 October 2020,"Jagshemash! This mockumentary once again centers around Kazakh reporter Borat Sagdiyev, a naïve misogynistic, racist, anti-Semitic stranger to American culture (Sacha Baron Cohen). While not as controversial shocking nor funny as the original. This Amazon Studios Video on Demand sequel directed by Jason Woliner deserved a high five for having more heart than the 2006 flick. While focusing on Borat's relationship with his daughter Tutar (Maria Bakalova) on her arranged marriage to a top US politician can get annoying at times especially with the actress use of a heavy Bulgarian accent loud over nagging voice. I found the chemistry between them generally moving. Good acting. Both individuals do grow more likeable as the film goes on and into better people. It's so unlike the first movie where the individuals mostly stay the same. Nevertheless, I didn't like what the filmmakers did with original supporting characters like Azamat (Ken Davitian) & Luenell (Luenell Campbell). I get that the performers had pay disputes, but their characters should be written off the film a little better than what we got. Still the sequel does a good job acknowledges its predecessor's success as well as the gap between movies, by explaining in universe that the first film made Kazakhstan into a laughing stock in the national stage. Thus, the government punish Borat for over a decade until he was given another chance with this sequel. Nevertheless, the guerrilla prank style filmmaking kinda has wine down since 2006; as the character's image has become way too popular. Cohen even had to retired Borat at one time due to being unable to fool unaware real people to gain access to their genuine' s reactions toward solecism for laughs. In order to make the movie work, Sacha had to put Borat under heavy makeup and new disguises or give comedic trolling the crowd scenarios to Tutar. Because of that, there is very few scenes of Borat dress in his traditional suit and acting like himself; which is a shame. To add onto that, the people that he does interacted with, seem more in with the joke than the other movie. I'm not saying that they were paid performers, but I doubt that conspiracy theorists Jerry Holleman and Jim Russell would allow a man with a filmmaking crew to stay with them for five whole days without noticing something odd during a pandemic. Bits like them going to find Tutar at a rally seem heavily rehearsed. The same can be said with Jeanise Jones who drives her to the clinic and gives a bizarre, but inspiriting semi long speech to Borat's daughter about womanhood. It's really hard to believe that these people didn't know that it was a work. The only confirm person that I can tell that was in with the joke was Holocaust survivor Judith Dim Evans. Her story was so charming that Cohen broke character. Sadly, the film's creators still got sued for fraud when her heirs brought the lawsuit alleging that Judith did not consent to the commercial use of her likeness despite otherwise. Surprisingly unlike the first movie that result in many legal actions by participants ranging from individuals to whole cities. This one had little. Still, as of this writing, it is too early to tell. After all politicians like Rudy Giuliani might sued over allegations of impropriety. The actress did kinda led him on. Regardless the country of Kazakhstan will probably continue to hate their backwater racism portrayal in these films. Some Kazakhstanis really wanted this film to be canceled. I doubt that they would be happy with the twist ending involving the coronavirus. Still it makes me wonder what was the original climax if the pandemic never did hit during the production of this movie. I can see it being much more grandeur. COVID-19 really did good a number on the flick as the banning of large gatherings meant less events for Borat to crash into. While Cohen was indeed lucky to gain access to one of the Republicans key conferences. He didn't get the reaction that he was looking for with Donald Trump like he got with Ali G with the ice cream glove business skit. It's a shame that the scenes with Trump got cut from the final version. As for the sequence with Mike Pence. That interaction wasn't as impressed in real life. Unlike the film with the long pause, Pence just continue his speech as if they weren't any disruption. Cohen was quickly escort out of the building. Unlike the first Borat flick, in which the actor was famously arrested nearly 100 times and follow by the FBI. He felt that he risked his livable more making this movie due to the harsh political unrest that came with the pandemic. Cohen even said there were two separate occasions in which he had to wear a bulletproof vest. It's safe to say that the rightwing rally where Borat sang an offensive song was probably one of them. While that song was somewhat catchy. It was still disturbing to see some people cheer him on. It reminds me so much of the 'Peace' episode of the Da Ali G Show when Borat sang a similar tune. While I do like that Cohen mocked their echo chamber attitude toward the coronavirus outbreak for all it's worth. I just wished they didn't recycle the same types of the pranks that you can see on one of his old show. It made some of the sequences somewhat tiresome. Meanwhile others felt disconnected and uncompleted like the random barbershop gag. Regardless, the humor in this is probably better than what Cohen plan in the unauthorized sequel called 'My Brother' starring Borat's mentally-challenged brother Bilo. The cringe factor in that version would be too much to handle. Overall: Dziekuje Cohen for making the right decision. In the end, while the movie is not as good as the original. It's still worth skipping sexy time to check out. A must watch.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm
22,nairtejas,"Outrageous, Funny In Parts, On-the-Point Satire / Grade C-",4,25 November 2020,"I struggled through Borat Subsequent Moviefilm not because it is as wild and ridiculous as the first part but because there's just too much that Sacha Baron Cohen stuffs into it, which made my viewing experience slightly unpleasant. Sure, there are LOL moments and absurd dialogues that make the film what it is, but after a while, the jokes aren't funny (not in a bad way, though). The critique on the Trump administration is spot-on, so maybe this is more targeted towards Americans. However, I have to admit that this sequel is more adventurous, mischievous, and courageous than the first part, which is all that matters sometimes. Grade C-.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm
23,The-Sarkologist,An Absolute Pearler,9,25 October 2020,"You really have to wonder how this film came together, especially with some of the scenes at the end. Mind you, I guess they really did roll with the times quite well, because I suspect that as things changed dramatically around March 2020 they had to completely rework the script at the last minute, but then again CoVid really did take the world by surprised (not that we didn't see anything like this coming, it is just that we basically live in our own little bubbles, and don't expect things that happen on the other side of the world to really affect us all that much).Look, I've never been a particularly big fan of Cohen, and I wasn't a particularly big fan of his first film, but a part of me wanted to see this film, even if it was because I was captivated by the trailer. It turned out to actually be pretty good, and surprisingly I found myself bursting out in laughter numerous times during the film. However, the thing that I thought was great was how the film simply seemed to roll with the times, especially since halfway through we have Borat wandering around the empty streets wandering where everybody has gone (and ends up shacking up with some conservatives for five days).Actually, that scene was pretty cool, because while on one hand there is the suggestion that he was mocking their beliefs, he was also demonstrating to us that they are actually nice guys. The fact that they let this guy stay with them for five days, and didn't get upset despite some of the really weird things that he was doing, and even went as far as to point out that his book was wrong, really does go to show that these people aren't actually the monsters that some people make them out to be.Mind you, the end scene is an absolute classic, and as Cohen indicates, we really should make up our mind as to what was really going on. It was quite funny though that the person that the joke was a target of thought that he had out played Cohen, without actually realising what was actually going on. Of course, once the film was released you can imagine that this person has immediately gone into damage control.I guess one of the problems with a film like this is that you aren't going to get the real reactions that you would if it wasn't being recorded, though I understand that Cohen does get into these things by pretending to be somebody completely different. However, the rather deadpan faces that you get with some of the scenes, such as in the family planning clinic and in the hardware store, as well as in the store with the fax machine, does suggest that while it was odd, it was not something that was really going to raise concerns (which no doubt would have had a completely different result if, say, they were using hidden cameras in the clinic).I tell you what though, Maria Bakalova was absolutely outstanding in this film, and she just falls into the role so well. The other thing is the way that they use language - like, I have no idea what they are speaking, and it certainly sounds as if they are communicating with each other, despite the fact that Bakalova is speaking Bulgarian, and Cohen is speaking Hebrew Gibberish (I'm not even sure if that is actually a language). Yet, they do it so well, and it comes across so authentic, despite the fact that it is all a put on.Yeah, this is actually a pretty cool film, and I must say that I really did enjoy it, even though it does make you feel uncomfortable in parts. Personally, I wouldn't necessarily call it eye opening, and I doubt that it is going to change the election all that much, but it was still a pretty good watch. Oh, and I did quite like the bit at the beginning where he actually played up the fact that he can't really walk around dressed as Borat anymore.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm
24,briancham1994,Almost as good as the original,7,24 October 2020,"Borat is back, and his second film does as much as can be done with the character in 2020. He is accompanied by his daughter Tutar who does a fine job of adding to the wacky comedy. The first half is still as great as the original but it declines as it's clear that their plans have fallen through and they have to desperately improvise. It is also let down by being too scripted.

This time around, Borat is accompanied by his 15 year old daughter. And she may have been the highlight as she steals her scenes, this is due to her cluelessness and likability.The reason as to why many people don't consider this film as good as the original is because the character of Borat, we have already seen. It is not fresh and new anymore and the shock value jokes aren't as great. Yet the daughter is a new character and many seem to be giving high praise for her. Including Sacha Baron Cohen who believes she deserves an Oscar nomination.Enjoyed this sequel but just as the original, it is for an acquired taste.

27,eddie_baggins,"A 2020 treat, even if its not on par with the original",6,1 November 2020,"2020 hasn't given us many surprises of the treat variety but one of the years nicest additions was the shock announcement that a new Borat film was on its way for our viewing needs and that it would be coming straight into our lounge-rooms for added Covid-related ease.The original 2006 outing of everyone's favorite Kazakhstan based journalist was a world-wide box office and critical smash and remains to this day some of the best work of its star Sacha Baron Cohen and its nice to know that while not as surprising or engaging this time around, Borat Subsequent Moviefilm (just one of the films many titles) is still at times just as offensive, funny, insightful and even oddly moving this time around.Understandably suffering from the fact these 14 years on from the first film have allowed many unsuspecting citizens to gain knowledge of who Borat is and who Cohen is in turn, Moviefilm doesn't have the same gold found in random encounters Borat has on his journey back to the USA to give a gift to a powerful politician with his daughter Tutar (played by game newcomer Maria Bakalova) in toe and the film does feel more staged and scripted than its more on the fly predecessor.It's not to say the film doesn't have some great moments that feel like they could never have been planned better (Borat's friendship with some Democrat hating citizens or appearance at a Mike Pence talk some such moments) but you can't escape the feeling that Moviefilm doesn't have the same natural charm as the 2006 original despite the engaging and committed central duo working wonders in their roles.Having lived as the character for various parts of his career, Cohen is an old-hat at such a Borat flavored outing and shines no matter the mask he dons or disguise he wears and much like Azamat Bagatov before her Tutar is a great new addition to the Borat cinematic world and Maria Bakalova gets some seriously funny moments to work her magic and even deliver a great message along the way as Tutar discovers that women can in fact drive cars and sleep outside of cages.Watching two such engaging performances ensures Movefilm is entertaining throughout, it doesn't help the films cause however of failing to live up to the legacy of the first Borat film and a sense that Cohen sometimes focuses on easy targets and even at times fails to bring out much comedic gold from his subjects despite his best efforts, ensures that this is a funny and watchable addition to the Borat cannon but not an overly memorable one.Final Say -In a year of disappointments its nice to know that Borat and his journalistic integrity is still intact and while Moviefilm isn't up too par with the beloved original, there's still enough laughs and insights to make this topical film worthwhile.3 cupcakes out of 5",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

Borat loves the idea, and before we know it, he is off to the US, not realizing that his 15 yr. Old daughter has come along, stowed away in the wooden crate that contains the gift...

Baron Cohen's observations are sharp, funny and utterly brilliant. Whereas the first Borat movie simply exists, ""Borat Subsequent Moviefilm"" comes wit an urgency that is timely and yes, political. Watch Borat infiltrate the 2020 CPAC conference (where Mike Pence proudly proclaims and boasts that ""we have COVID-19 completely under control"", yea he really said that). Watch Borat infiltrate the household of two guys who are so far down the rabbit hole of conspiracy theories, they literally don't know which side is up or down anymore. Watch Boris infiltrate and address a big MAGA crowd to bait them into even more explicit racism and bigotry. And of course to top it off, watch Rudy Giuliani get fleeced by his own desire and hunger for young women. And so on. I haven't laughed this much and this loud in a long time. Bottom line: ""Borat Subsequent Moviefilm"" is one of the year's best, period.""Borat Subsequent Moviefilm"" for unexplained reasons never got a theatrical release.

I absolutely love the original 'Borat' film from 2006. It would be very close to one of my favourite comedy films of all time. I hate it when a sequel to a film I love comes along and tarnishes its reputation. I'm pleased to say that even though 'Borat Subsequent Moviefilm' doesn't come close to recreating the magic the original found, it is still more than competent enough to do no damage whatsoever to the original.I was surprised how little difference there was in the 'Borat' character considering the 14 year gap between films. I remember when 'Dumb and Dumberer' came out I couldn't get over how different the characters looked and acted to their younger versions. That isn't the case here though. Sacha Baron Cohen clearly takes very good care of himself and I suspect he has also continued to practise the character over the years.I actually really liked the story they picked for this sequel. It worked really well and was always guiding the film without ever taking it over. There's also a nice little twist to look out for. The only thing letting the film down is basically memorable moments. The original had so many of them, whereas 'Borat Subsequent Moviefilm' feels more like a film that is fun to watch once, but will then be quickly forgotten.

Anyway, I was genuinely excited for that show, and it was brilliant at first, but then I bailed on it during one of the last episodes. Sacha Baron Cohen has obviously always been about the cringe comedy, and sometimes that crosses over into just plain cringe.I was scared that this Borat sequel - I can't be bothered typing out the whole name - would do the same.Of course, it does get into cringe material multiple times, but thankfully there were only one or two scenes that bordered on no-longer-funny territory.The thing is, the point of this character, going way back to the original ""Ali G Show"", was always to expose the prejudice and ignorance of real people, who relaxed and let their bigotry show when they met a character who was as offensive as them. He holds a mirror up to society, and it is not pretty, but he gets us laughing, at least some of the time.With ""society"" what it is right now at the time of the movie's release, after four years of Trump, QAnon, Proud Boys, conspiracy theories, riots in the streets, all topped off by a global pandemic, the result could hardly NOT make you cringe. But we need to laugh at how ridiculous things are as well. We need Borat more than ever.Funny, then, that Baron Cohen isn't the real stand-out of this, er, ""subsequent moviefilm"". That honour goes to the amazing newcomer Maria Bakalova, who plays his daughter, and could really be not only Borat Sagdiyev's real daughter, but also that of Baron Cohen, so perfectly does she nail the character AND the satire the character represents.

37,kevin_robbins,This isn't as good as the first film but was still fairly entertaining,7,30 July 2021,"Borat (2020) is a movie we watched on Amazon Prime as soon as it was released. The storyline follows our good friend Borat when he returns to to the United States, this time with his daughter, to uncover critical details about the pandemic, election and disgrace that is the United States society. This movie is directed by Jason Woliner (The Last Man on Earth) and stars Sacha Baron Cohen (Bruno), Maria Bakalova (Fleabag) and Tom Hanks (Forest Gump). The comedic content in this was inconsistent but had some great display of the people who vote for Trump, their thought process and how rationale they come across with their thought processes, including members of his actual presidential regime. It was a very accurate representation on a large percentage of our society. The daughter to me wasn't as natural as Cohen in her role, she felt very awkward throughout the film; however, the scene with Giuliani was gold. Overall this isn't as good as the first film but was still fairly entertaining. I'd score this a 6.5/10.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

39,st-shot,"Tasteless, hateful satire with a chuckle or two.",2,30 October 2020,"In his latest film Sach Cohen reprises his Borat character from a dozen years back in this crude smug comedy that will have one side cheering the other side ignoring. There is no denying its share of outrageously funny moments but minus the new target it is simply a stale dozen year old routine in which the mockery has taken on a more mean spirited tone than before.The plot revolves around getting Jimmy the Chimp to VP Mike Pence in the US. The disgraced Borat is chosen to deliver him but his daughter stows away eats the simian and creates other headaches for her father, enabling Borat to mock and humiliate (save for precious PCs) his usual suspects.Cohen returns to his career peak by reprising a character best dealt with in small doses and well past its prime. He does have tools to outrage comically and does so but the shock of it a dozen years back is not even a surprise now. The scatology, below the belt humor and endless dopey responses are about as fresh as a Beavis and Butthead re-run.Cohen, clearly playing to a target audience seems more venal this time around utilizing Trump for his own running of the Jews and more or less exposing his own slanderous tactics. Amazingly he does just that in the final scene before sentimentally signing off with a film dedication to Judith Dim Davis, a holocaust survivor featured in the films most (only?) touching and eloquent scene. She passed away before the film was released so we'll never know how she felt about sassy Sach being slugged in the groin or taking a dump in front of Trump Tower. A mean spirited, crass satire, sadly evocative of the people and the age. Now.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm
40,alindsay-al,A Good Outrageous Sequel,7,25 October 2020,"So last month a trailer came out of nowhere for Borat 2 and would be released on Amazon Prime and for fans of the first film that came out 14 years ago this was something to look forward to and now it is here with us and I have just watched it and here is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees Borat return to The United States to gain favour with Donald Trump for his home country of Kazakhstan.Main Character
In my opinion Sacha Baron Cohen's iconic role is that of Borat so seeing him return to the role all these years later is fantastic, he still has it and even after all these years he still is as outrageous as he was back then. It is nice to see that he can give a strong dramatic performance in Trial Of The Chicago 7 and then not long after switch it up and play this really funny off the wall character. Some of the things that come out of his mouth in this film are crazy and will make you laugh.Supporting Characters
Maria Bakalova is a new actress to me and she plays Borat's daughter in this film and she really shines here, she even manages to go punch for punch with Cohen in terms of outrageousness and craziness. This is an actress that will probably get more work after this and it will be great to see just where her acting career goes from here. Now this film is unique as pretty much everybody else are real people that weren't exactly sure they were in a movie and it mostly works as the reactions are genuine and it is funny throughout.Story
The story isn't the most important part of a film like this but I have to talk about it. There is actually more depth to this plot, the relationship between Borat and his daughter is quite sweet and is well done and just the stuff to do with politics is crazy and highly entertaining. But there were some elements of the plot that didn't work for me, there are just some unnecessary parts of the film that are there just to set up a specific joke which didn't work for me. Also there is a twist at the end of the film and even for a film as controversial as this one I am not sure now was an appropriate time for it and it felt a bit tasteless.Script
Now let's face it a film like this the most important thing is whether it is funny and the answer is yes it is funny, but not really funny. There are some really funny bits here, some of the things that are said are just really funny and really fit the tone of this film. Also the little bit of heart added here is nice to see. But there are some jokes that do fall flat, it is mostly the ones involving the less mad storylines, and when the other person to Borat doesn't really play along.Style
This film will go down as one of the mad styles ever, so basically Sasha Baron Cohen went around as Borat without people knowing they were being filmed. Obviously the now well known scenes with the politicians have been controversial but really feel unique and show the awfulness of politics, also this film does a great job of just insulting everybody. Though more then the first film, it feels like this is a really strong 1 hour special that had to force an extra 30 mins in order to qualify as a film which makes some parts of the film to feel much less funny.Overall
Overall, this is a funny film, not as good as the first film but a worthy sequel. Now even though I am going to give this a positive score, I must say that you have to know what you are getting into and I would say fans of the first film are really the ones who will enjoy this film and maybe avoid if you aren't.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

After serving a long prison sentence, Borat is sent on a mission to the US to give his daughter to Mike Pence thereby increasing Kazakhstan's standing.Much the same as the original with plenty to enjoy, albeit the originality has passed, hence not the shocker the first one was. That said there are many wonderful swipes at Trump and his supporters incl the NRA, inherent racism, the belief in buzzwords and theatre rather than facts and the handling of COVID. Rudy Giuliani loses a lot of credibility here coming across as quite a creep (irrespective of who you vote for) it must be said - funny though.So ultimately quite a few laughs, some misfires but worth catching for the messages it sends.

42,jimbo-53-186511,"Some parts of the film are genuinely hilarious, but sadly it is a little inconsisent overall",6,25 October 2020,"Borat is back and after upsetting practically everyone following the events of the 2006 original film he attempts to make amends by offering a prize to a senior US political figure. Naturally, things don't run smoothly and both Borat and his unwilling subject form an unlikely bond as the narrative progresses....I absolutely loved the original Borat and when I learned recently that a sequel was streaming on Amazon Prime I leapt at the chance and decided to watch it this evening. Whilst on the whole I enjoyed this sequel it's definitely missing something when compared to the original...It starts out well and there are several moments in the first 20 minutes or so that are very reminiscent of the original Borat film; there's the naivety and general sense of innocence with the character of Borat that we witnessed in the original film which were a big factor in making the original film work. However, in the sequel these aspects seem to be lost somewhere from 30 minutes onwards...Ok so the film is still fun and remains this way throughout, but the actual subtext to the story is extremely heavy-handed and somewhat unnecessary; somebody within the cast or production team is clearly heavily right-wing/republican and I did find that the serious political stance did take away from the film. This is offset at times by Borat and the republicans downplaying the virus (which does afford the film with some of its funnier moments), but what made the original film work so well is that you genuinely felt that you were watching an idiot go to America, make a fool of himself but with subtle winks to the camera.In this sequel the plot gets in the way far too much and the heavy-handed approach employed arguably takes away more than it adds (it's shamelessly right-wing and pro-Trump which for me regardless of your political allegiance) makes the film too self-aware and makes it less funny. Thankfully the film does get back on track from time to time (the idea that Borat has inadvertently injected himself with the virus and spread it around the world is where the film is strong and had the film focussed on this I think it would have been better - essentially seeing an idiot inadvertently creating a global pandemic)Still Sacha Baron Cohen is as brilliant as he always is and newcomer Maria Bakalova is also excellent (and her makeover transformation is incredible). Whilst the final scenes in the film were hilarious I found the heavy-handed politics a little too much at times. It almost felt like I was watching a lengthy pro-Republican/Anti-democratic broadcast (and the sheer number of Trump's cabinet that appeared in the film merely re-inforces this point making me think he either had a hand in bankrolling the film or somebody in the production crew was a big Republican).All that being said, this sequel to Borat made me laugh (a lot) and the ridiculous hyperbole surrounding the virus also resonated with me (I agree that it's all overhyped). This sequel is still good, but second time around things feel a little too serious and self-aware which tarnish the overall quality of this sequel.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm
43,r96sk,Better than they have any right to be - entirely thanks to Sacha Baron Cohen,7,1 November 2020,"These films are way better than they have any right to be - entirely thanks to Sacha Baron Cohen.I enjoyed 'Borat Subsequent Moviefilm' more than its predecessor from 2006, which relied too heavily on shock sex humour for my liking - though I did still like it all in all. This sequel is a little more creative with its jokes, whilst still having the necessary silliness and cringe.Cohen is excellent as he reprises the role of Borat. He made me laugh a number of times, any other actor in this role simply wouldn't be funny - he somehow makes it work expertly, his perfect delivery being crucial.In the first film, Cohen had Ken Davitian alongside him. Davitian doesn't return which is a shame, but he isn't missed to be honest. Maria Bakalova steps in very well, I feared her Tutar character was going to be irritating but she's anything but - Bakalova holds her own alongside Cohen.It's amusing, in ways that are indeed funny but also in ways that you know you shouldn't be laughing at - though that's critical to these films working.

47,aidanratesmovies,An Excellent Sequel,10,23 October 2020,"Incredibly enjoyable, hilarious, and very entertaining- the sequel to 2006's legendary comedy Borat somehow is able to not only hold up in this time and age, but also prove to be almost just as good as its predecessor. Being a huge fan of Sacha Baron Cohen, I enjoyed this film quite a lot. It was what I wanted it to be, not necessarily more, but it was satisfying to watch nevertheless. The film is a brilliant and well executed satire on values, our government today, and of course politics- and between these themes, ideas, and messages, it is also able to provide a surprisingly compelling story. I of course enjoyed Cohen's return as the outrageous titular character, as well as the continuation and expansion on many of the insane concepts from the first film. The biggest surprise of the film, however, is Maria Bakalova performance as Borat's daughter Tutar. She is not only able to keep up with Borat's outrageous situations, but also prove to be quite funny, moving, and fun to watch on screen. It's an insane film, with insane shoes to fill, but somehow this sequel from legendary comedian Sacha Baron Cohen is able to accomplish all of it, while proving to be more consistent and almost as funny as the original.

48,questl-18592,BS Moviefilm,5,3 April 2021,"I'm thinking Borat just isn't my thing. It's been a long time since I watched the original and I remember not caring for it. Worth the sequel, I'd say it's an improvement on what I remember but still not great. I just don't care for this character, this shtick and I really don't buy into this docu-comedy style.I'm not 100% on what it is either but I think part of it is the inherent cringe nature of it all. Throughout both films we watch Cohen do absurd things to get reactions out of people in an effort to show us the horrible nature of certain conservative values and, to an extent, human nature in general.Now, to be fair there are some moments where people shine, but for the most part it feels like such an effort to highlight the bigotry and ridiculousness of certain people as he goads them on and on and then edits in only the ""best"" reactions. There's something about the way it's put together that just makes it feel false to me in a lot of ways and then doesn't land.Don't get me wrong, these people exist and do and say and think some awful things at times, I'm not arguing that. There's just something about the way he goes about this that doesn't jive right with me and I just can't bring myself to connect with it or find the comedy.I feel like this is a love it or hate it kind of movie for the most part and while I don't love it, I'm trying to see the skill it's taking to pull something like this off in the first place. Especially for Bakalova who never breaks character even when she 100% has reason to.As for recommendations, I think I'd you liked the first one you'll like this. I think if you aren't in love with the first one, this one is better but I doubt it will change your mind on the whole thing.

50,valleyjohn,Borat exposing the Americans for the idiots they are !,7,26 October 2020,"Was dropped on the public on very short notice and In these Covid times when big movies aren't being released , it's definitely very welcome .
Sasha Baron Cohen was never going to be able to match the the first film for one simple reason and that is that everyone in America now recognised him.
The way he has got around the undercover stuff is to have his daughter do lots of the set pieces and it works quite well .
Maria Balakovo who plays Tutar the daughter , is really good .Cohen is again taking the piss out of the right wing American public and it seems an easy thing to do .
Their prejudices are always bubbling just underneath which makes it extremely easy to prize out - whether that be sexism , homophobia or racism .The whole film builds up to a quite remarkable interview with Rudy Giuliani .
It's an incredibly cringeworthy scene where you start of thinking what a nice man he is and then he stars to spew the lies we are at accustomed to hearing but that's not the worst of it . He is led into the hotel bedroom where he proceeds to be seduced by a Borats daughter . God knows what he would have done if it was allowed to carry on .This is obviously not as good as the first film because it's not a new format and it could do with more undercover scenes instead of the silly storyline sketches but I did laugh several times and that's rare for comedy film in the last few years .",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

52,jadepietro,A Fool Never Learns,8,24 October 2020,"GRADE: BTHIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Funny and biting satire about American values, handled adroitly by Mr. Cohen and company.JIM'S REVIEW: Borat Subsequent Moviefilm: Delivery of Prodigious Bribe to American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan is a long clumsy title for a long clumsy but very entertaining movie. This mockumentary is a comedy of errors with many of its naive targets being right-wing nuts or staunch conservatives. The liberal sanction of our nation are spared any criticism or folly. Were the film more balanced, the end result would have been more uproarious in its biting satire of this country's polarity and skewed American values. Let's face it, there are good fools on both sides!Once again, Sasha Baron Cohan revives his most famous personality, Borat Sagdiyev, a fictional newscaster who creates havoc wherever he goes. This time around, 14 years later, the plot is not so scattershot and crude. The sequel concentrates on a father-daughter relationship and has many sweet and humorous transitional scenes between Borat and his 15 year-old teenager, Tutar, a Bulgarian actress in her early 20's named Maria Bakalova. (More on her later.) The plot centers around his mission to gift his daughter to Vice President Mike Pence as a present from his country, Kazakhstan. Of course, there will be many detours and obstacles along the way.Some set pieces work better than others. There is a very funny segment at a Southern debutant's ball that can be be quite offensive depending on your level of humor as the hi-jinks may stretch the level of good taste for some moviegoers. (This reviewer found it laugh-out-loud hilarious.) A public sing-along at a Trump rally where supporters sing out bigoted remarks that reek of white supremacy and a visit to a woman's clinic also zings with its pious righteousness. Other pranks fall flat like a trip to a barber, a visit to a synagog questioning the reality of the Jewish Holocaust, an overnight sleepover with QAnon conspiracy theorists, and the aforementioned Mike Pence daughter giveaway at a CPAC rally.Perhaps the major set piece and most controversial section of the movie is a unpleasant scene involving Rudi Giuliani in an interview that leads to his hotel bedroom with the young Tutar. The politician is already spinning his story in his fall from grace, but the visuals more than prove his deviant intent in an interview gone terribly wrong. His hypocrisy and sexual demeanor remains highly questionable in his Candid Camera moment...one he cannot undo that easily.Still one continually questions the gullibility of many of the peoples' idiocy, but there it is front and center for all to see: A baker, supporting her First Amendment rights, casually writes her anti-Semitic message in the best of cursive icing. A wealthy father comments on the $500 price tag of sex trafficking with his own daughter in earshot range. A pastor decries an abortion even though he learns it may have occurred through incest. One questions the scandalous commonality of these encounters. Despite a camera and film crew and seeing Mr. Cohen's obvious outrageous disguises, these saps easily become pawns in his attempts to prank them. And, for the most part, Mr. Cohen succeeds in mocking their abhorrent behaviors. This movie thrives on its politically incorrectness and shock value as its original source did in 2006, although its humor is not as mean-spirited or sexually charged as before.Abetting Mr. Cohen's political showmanship is some deft direction by Jason Wollner in his film debut and a literate screenplay that boasts a beguiling comic relationship that is inane and lovable by its leads. Ms. Bakalova is charming as the Melania wannabe and the actress has some nice comic timing, not to mention, courage to be put in some of these awkward situations, She is a strong counterbalance to the buffoonish Borat, played to imperfection by Mr. Cohan. This comedian has created an iconic and zany Everyman and his farcical instincts are still spot-on. He is unafraid to tackle contemporary political issues ranging from the Coronavirus to America's fascination with hate rhetoric. This film is on par with the inventive hit-and-miss rapid-fire comedies that are reminiscent of the slapstick satires from long ago, films in the tradition of the Marx Brothers, Mel and Albert Brooks, Christopher Guest, and some early Woody Allen gems.Sometimes subtle in his indignation of our American way of life, but mostly shamelessly excessive in his political skewering, Mr. Cohen latest absurdist comedy, Borat Subsequent Moviefilm, delivers his message with real flair.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

57,arungeorge13,A hilariously over-the-top sequel that doesn't quite match up to the original! [+71%],7,24 October 2020,"Although better structured from a narrative standpoint, Borat Subsequent Moviefilm lacks the authenticity of the first. But oh boy, can Sacha Baron Cohen (who plays the titular character) and Maria Bakalova (who plays Tutar, Borat's 15-year-old daughter) make you laugh your guts out! While this is very much a movie about Borat's ridiculous antics (and disguises), its emotional core is centered around Tutar. Bakalova is sensational here, as the ""daughter-in-a-cage"" who accidentally smuggles herself to America (even getting a full-blown character arc).The political commentary here is spot on too, and it leaves you wondering how much of those scenes were actually prompted. It even packs in deliciously over-the-top cameos from Mike Pence (crashing his CPAC speech), Rudy Giuliani (in a career-killing, compromising scene), and Tom Hanks (in a totally wild COVID-19 moment!). The film unleashes the characters of Borat and Tutar onto the American streets, letting them evolve and have realizations gradually. Baron Cohen's ability to expose the xenophobia, bigotry, and misogyny of (certain sections of) Americans is par none; honestly, it doesn't intrigue you at all in 2020. In fact, he trolls everyone and everything from data-stealing Facebook to people's obsession with cosmetic surgeries, denial of climate change, the Saudi Arabian stand on women's rights, flat-Earthers, and more.The obvious difference between the original and the sequel is that while the former wasn't a flat-out activist film, the latter more or less is. It even has a closing card that says ""Now vote, or you will be execute"". The earlier portions of the film, however, has all the Borat shenanigans you need - like Borat acquainting himself with smartphones, sending messages on fax, meeting an Instagram influencer, a ""misunderstood abortion"" scene, and rolling out a wholesome WTF! moment at a debutante ball. Alongside the humor, what works is Tutar's journey to free herself from patriarchal chains while Borat discovers he is just a few notches below the American conservative.All said and done, Borat Subsequent Moviefilm will have a shorter shelf life owing to the current political climate (and the elections) as opposed to the forever-memorable first film. Even if it's just a film for 2020, I'll take it as it is. It's a 95-minute laughter fest and one that'll make you forget you're living in a world that's more worthless than Borat's.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm
58,Abdulxoxo,Fairly amusing,6,19 July 2021,"My feelings for this film are fairly similar to the last one. Some bits were funny, but much of it wasn't. The narrative structure of this film is there to begin with. It's ludicrous, but at least it's somewhat structured. It doesn't take too long however for the structure to begin to crack and the film to become mostly a collection of political and/or gross out skits. Obviously after the success of the first film Borat is a recognisable character. This is even brought up in the movie. For that reason Cohen has brought in Bakalova to play his daughter and sent her out to do most of the ballsy, cringe worthy stuff that he simply wouldn't be able to do anymore without people realising what was going on. I thought she stole this movie. She was involved in most of the funny scenes. One of the major issues I have when watching this, is what do they tell people about the cameras? There are some scenes where you can tell that we're watching real people reacting is real ways. There are some scenes that are obviously staged. There are also quite a few scenes though where we're meant to believe they are real, but I'm extremely sceptical. In those scenes I was slightly taken out of the movie as I was too busy trying to work out if the people were in on the joke, were they actors or were they just as stupid and gullible as they'd need to be to get genuinely pranked like this? When it comes to a film like this, it all comes down to taste. What somebody finds funny somebody else will find offensive. Sasha Baron Cohen, and Borat as a character, is all about pushing the boundaries. We all have a line. In the times where he stays on the right side for me there were a few laughs; but too often he goes over the line far enough for me to not find it funny.

I'll stand by it being a provocative, gross, yet undeniably clever and hilarious satirical masterpiece, so the idea of a sequel not living up to that standard is understandable.There's a good deal in America at the moment for someone like Sacha Baron Cohen to make fun of, and while this isn't quite as good as his recent series Who Is America, there are a number of very funny sequences sprinkled throughout, especially in the film's second half. This is when the film shows Borat dealing with COVID-19 and the response to it within the USA, and is both funny and genuinely interesting as one of the first major movies to deal with the still very recent issue.There were a few parts here and there that made me laugh pretty hard, and a few sections that didn't quite land. It's not super consistent, and the humour definitely isn't as fresh as it once was. Still, if you like Sacha Baron Cohen's style of humour, you'll probably find some things to like here, and if not, this certainly won't convert you to being a fan,It's a solid enough sequel- may not have the staying power of the first, but I mostly enjoyed it, and am ultimately glad it exists.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

I'm probably in the latter camp, mostly because I can appreciate how politically incorrect comedy can be ""safely"" created by introducing a cultural/language barrier. 14 years later, and I'm certain that the people who didn't find the original Borat funny won't find the humor in Borat Subsequent Moviefilm (2020).As an American, it's amusing to see our foibles pulled out as the butt of the joke in this film, especially after we've made fools of ourselves through the last decade of partisan politics and recent refusal of science and common sense. And while Borat Subsequent Moviefilm still relies on physical and sexual humor that is awkward to watch, there are moments of pure genius that I felt improved upon the original formula. Sure, there seemed to be less ""unscripted"" bits than before, but that's probably why this sequel works better.In fact, while the ""shock value"" is still there in moments of backward cultural standards, this actually allowed for some fantastic character development. Plus, if you want a movie that captures this unique slice in time that is 2020, Borat Subsequent Moviefilm is it. I don't want to give away too much, but the ending is absolutely perfect and navigating the political and pandemic landscape this smartly could only be done by Borat (Sacha Baron Cohen) himself. Future films may be forced to incorporate this peculiar scenario in human history, but Borat ran with it and hit a home run.A surprisingly effective mockumentary about 2020, I give Borat Subsequent Moviefilm 4.0 stars out of 5.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

66,bankofmarquis,Nice Try,5,19 April 2021,"I have to admit that I never watched the 2006 BORAT film, but when it's sequel BORAT SUBSEQUENT MOVIEFILM was nominated for 2 Oscars(!) - including Best Supporting Actress - I knew I would have to check this one out.I have heard the following words and phrases used to describe the BORAT films: daring, ingenious, hilarious, cringe-inducing, smart, dumb, original and important. I would add one other word to this list:Boring.Sitting on the screen for and hour and a half like a Saturday Night Live skit that is being stretched too long, BORAT SUBSEQUENT MOVIEFILM held my attention for about the first 15 minutes where I thought that it was kind of funny and clever. And then it went on...and on...and on...running the same ""sabotage"" joke into the ground, pulling unsuspecting innocents into the outrageous world of Borat (though, I have to admit that most of these ""unsuspecting innocents"" knew exactly what was going on and were playing along).Sasha Baron-Cohen is a smart filmmaker, writer and performer and he has earned the right to do whatever he feels like he wants to do. I prefer him in such movie fare as SWEENEY TODD, LES MISERABLES and the recent TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO SEVEN. But, if he feels like he wants to do things like Borat, who am I to argue. He certainly puts his all into the character, the scenarios and the guerilla film-making that is required, so good for him.Maria Bakalova is nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Oscar as she plays Borat's daughter who accompanies him on his journey across America. It is a ""fine"" performance and brings something that this film sorely needs - heart. But Oscar worthy? I don't think so.I must also give credit to the filmmakers for pivoting when the pandemic hit. They were in the middle of creating this (obviously) anti-Trump political farce of a film when Covid-19 forced them to pivot - and pivot they did, making this film as much about the virus than it is about politics.Ultimately, this is a case where I can admire the attempt, the art, the craftmanship and skill and talent needed to pull this movie off. But as a film, it just didn't go anywhere and I found myself looking at my watch wondering when this film would be over.And...no...I don't think I'll go back a ""catch-up"" on the first BORAT film.Letter Grade: C+5 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm
67,Ruskington,Soft-hitting and tedious,3,24 May 2021,"While the original Borat material is generally very good, this is nothing more than SBC feasting on the low-hanging comedy fruit that is mocking Trump and his supporters. Very few laughs, a boring plot and the usual political gags that do nothing more than increase the left-right friction.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm
68,agmoldham,Well worth a watch,6,25 October 2020,"It seems 2020 is going to be the year of watching movies at home, so this is my first 'home movie' review. One of the great things about comedies at the cinema is that you can hear what everyone else thinks of the movie. This is especially the case with a movie like Borat where some of the comedy is very subtle.Anyway overall the second Borat movie is an entertaining watch. At times you do wonder how politically correct some of the humour is, but comedy should push these boundaries. I suppose the stand out moment of the movie is the Rudy Giuliani scene which has got a lot of publicity. I'm sure this will have boosted the viewing figures and it doesn't look good. It seems his days of being regarded as one of the hero's of 9/11 are long behind.Whatever your thoughts are on the original Borat film you're pretty certain to feel the same way about this movie.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

70,bob-the-movie-man,Crude: check. Offensive: check. It's Borat... what do you expect?,6,20 November 2020,"Kazakh news-hound Borat Margaret Sagdiyev (Sacha Baron Cohen) is in trouble with his country's rulers after his first 'moviefilm' brought shame and disrepute to the country. Under threat of death he is sent on a mission to deliver Johnny - a monkey, but the most popular celebrity in Kazakhstan - as a gift to Donald Trump.All of this gets badly derailed when Johnny meets an untimely end during transportation. Fortunately all is not lost, since Borat's daughter Tutar (Maria Bakalova) has smuggled herself into the States. Borat determines to offer Tutar as a gift to US VP Mike Pence. But first, she must be made less feral and more acceptable to US society.Baron Cohen has made his primary career out of spoofing both celebrities and common-or-garden bigots, giving them the rope with which to hang themselves with their outrageous views. This is what he did so successfully in the first Borat film in 2006. An issue now is that, since that first movie made Borat such a pop icon, his appearance on the street in his usual garb generates unwelcome attention. As such he adopts a variety of different disguises to get closer to his ""victims"".Helpfully, his ""daughter"" (a brilliant Bulgarian actress Maria Bakalova) is an unknown face, and takes some of this strain on her own shoulders.So, I'm in no way a prude. And the antics in here generated a half dozen chuckles and a few genuine belly laughs. But some of the gags went just too far for me, and strayed into ""genuinely uncomfortable"" territory. A ""moonblood"" dance is just plain gross. And, notwithstanding Baron Cohen's Jewish roots, a gag involving the holocaust treads into territory that I don't think should be remotely approached for the purposes of comedy.Many of the (allegedly) unaware stars manage to crucify themselves - and presumably, in some cases, their careers - by coming out with the most appalling commentary that often beggars belief. A doctor - Charles Wallace - would surely be struck off if in the UK. Others just appear gullible and/or easily led. Rudy Giuliani's behaviour - although ambiguous - is at the very least lewdly suspicious. You just wish that the team would have let the action proceed a bit longer.As a saving grace, amongst all the crass and bigoted behaviour, there are individuals that shine out as warm and generous individuals. One is holocaust survivor Dim Evans, who sadly died earlier this year, holding out a hand of friendship to Borat when he appears in a synagogue obscenely and ridiculously dressed as a Jew.But the real star of the show is unemployed 'babysitter' Jeanise Jones who is genuinely taken in by the plight of Tutar. The warmth, concern and compassion she shows is genuinely heart-warming. The best news to come out of the whole movie is that a GoFundMe page, astutely created by her pastor, has so far raised more than $180,000 to help her out of poverty. This is on top of the $100,000 that Sacha Baron Cohen has donated to her Oklahoma City community.2020 has been a bizarre year in general, but no more so than with the election shenanigans in the US. It's really difficult for any comedy film to top that. 'Borat 2' gives it a go. And you can only be impressed by the bravado of Sacha Baron Cohen in putting him in those (potentially dangerous) situations. But ultimately this outing ends up feeling overly-scripted and 'forced' compared to the original. Borat fans will no doubt love it. I tolerated it, and was intermittently entertained. But I would have preferred more of the clever hilarious bits and less of the cringingly crude and offensive stuff.Oh... and if you're ever on ""Pointless"" and need a pointless Tom Hanks movie... don't forget this one!(For the full graphical review, please check out the bob the movie man web site or One Mann's Movies on Facebook.

73,vampire_hounddog,"Lacks the freshness of the original but needs to be seen even if to see Rudy Giuliani ""tucking in his shirt"".",4,6 November 2020,"Shamed former Kazakh TV presenter Borat Sagdiyev (Sacha Baron Cohen) is given a second chance by the President of Kazakhstan (Dano Popescu) and seek out President Trump in the US of A. His daughter, Tutar (Maria Bakalova) tags along in search of ""Princess"" Melania. His journey takes him across America on another odyssey.Given that this is a sequel to the original 2006 BORAT film which Baron Cohen had previously retired in 2007, it lacks any freshness and this second BORAT mockumentary feature feels a little dated and tired. That the Borat character is also so recognisable also means that he has to go in disguise for much of the film.Nevertheless that it was made in the year before the 2020 elections in America and at the time of the start of the Covid pandemic makes for interesting timing. However, it is the verve and energy of Bakalova as his partner in crime here that provides much of the foil for the laughs and some of the most jaw dropping moments on the film. Although the more gross out scenes are more of a turn off, there are a couple of outstanding scenes worthy of note, such as Baron Cohen dressed in a Trump fat suit crashing a Vice President Mike Pence speech at the CPAC 2020 conference and most sensationally of all pulling off the honey trap against Rudy Giuliani in a hotel room leading to former New York Mayor and Trump loyalist declaring after the film's release that he was only ""tucking in his shirt"".The film has more hisses than misses, but some of the mere chutzpah needs to be seen to be believed.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm
74,kjproulx,An Enjoyable Character in an Mediocre Sequel,6,25 October 2020,"Being a huge fan of Borat from 2006 and thinking it was a very clever film, given how uncomfortable certain scenes may have been to watch, I was eagerly awaiting the sequel that was secretly filmed earlier this year. Borat Subsequent Moviefilm (and the rest of the title that I'm not filling in for this review) may not be anywhere as funny or as original as its predecessor, but for the time being, there are a few very memorable moments. The first film was a satire on society but done so in a way that is sort of timeless. This sequel plays off of too many things happening in 2020 to really feel like it could be a long-lasting film. This film is all over the news and I'm sure it'll be popular for the next few weeks, but I simply can't see it being talked about ten years from now.Borat is a character played magnificently well by Sacha Baron Cohen and follows him on his journey through the United States, exposing the most disgusting aspects of it. This sequel is no different from that, except the plot of the film itself gets a little lost in translation at times. The film begins with Borat being given a mission to deliver a monkey to Vice President Michael Pence but then evolves into him having to connect with his daughter and possibly deliver her to him instead. Along the way, this film has some fun with the two of them wandering around, but I found this sequel to be far too heavy in terms of politics. All this film wanted to do was expose how corrupt the political scene is in the United States and I felt like it was too much at times.With all of that said, there are a couple of moments in particular where I found myself wondering how he didn't end up in jail for doing/filming such things, so props to him for pulling it all off. Sadly, I think even certain scenes took things too far and I wasn't exactly laughing, but feeling more uncomfortable, which is probably what their goal was. From incest jokes to luring older men into hotel rooms, this film just goes for it and doesn't hold back. Again, I give it all the props in the world for that, but I won't remember it for being as clever and unique as the first. This film deserves praise for pulling off a sequel in today's climate, but honestly not much more in my opinion.Sacha Baron Cohen is absolutely fantastic at playing this character and that's what makes these films so enjoyable; However, after seeing him in films like Hugo and more recently in The Trial of the Chicago 7, sure, his knack will always be in comedy, but I think he needs to broaden his horizons a little more. Even in Borat Subsequent Moviefilm, he shows off his dramatic talents as well, which makes me wish I could see him more dramatic films. Maria Bakalova plays his daughter Tutar in the film and I thought she actually did a great job portraying a character related to Borat, but I thought her character, although the heart of the movie itself, worn thin by the end. Their bond together worked for me, but it felt like a weird balance between sentimental and humourous and that just clashed for me.Overall, Borat Subsequent Moviefilm is far more controversial than the first in terms of the content, but also less funny and less shocking, so I'm not exactly sure I can give it a recommendation, especially if you didn't see the first film and at least enjoy watching it. These are films that are made for a specific audience and if you know it's not for you, I'd take that advice from yourself. I love the first Borat film and that's why I found this one mildly amusing, but I truly can't get myself to give it any high praise. I chuckled throughout the majority of it, but I felt like I was also forcing myself to a few times. It's not necessary to watch, but if you're already a fan then it's worth a watch. Borat Subsequent Moviefilm is now streaming on Prime Video.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm
75,tm-sheehan,Thumbs Down from me,4,3 March 2021,"My Review- Borat Subsequent MoviefilmMy Rating 4/10I didn't see the first Borat:Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan the trailer was enough to turn me off but since then Sacha Baron Cohen has impressed me in films like Les Misérables, Hugo, Sweeney Todd and a Best of career performance this year as Abbie Hoffman in ""The Trial of the Chicago 7 so I thought I'd give Mr Borat a go ,especially reading it was lampooning the ""Trump"" regime and its influence on American ""culture "".
I have in opinion a very broad sense of humour especially satire or dark humour if it's well written and has a point to it but Borat I find is a character that I find repulsive.I can't find humour in the character Borat's underage daughter Tutar (Maria Bakalova ) performing a raunchy folk dance at a debutante prom and lifting her skirts while she is menstruating and displaying the obvious visual evidence.Its not funny to me and also I think it's an insult to women that Borat is trying to market his underage daughter to Rudy Giuliani after she fails to impress Mike Pence.
I don't find it amusing whenI also don't find humour in Borat's shock horror when he reads fake news that the holocaust was a conspiracy and never occurred.
I know some will say I missed the point entirely it's a sendup but it's not clever just to be offensive.
I love clever well written comedy ,satire ,send up like Mel Brooks , John Waters and Randy Rainbow to name a few but Borat leaves me totally unimpressed.As for Sacha Baron Cohen's win at The Golden Globes this week for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy I think the Category itself is pointless as Musicals and Comedy are totally separate Categories.
When Lin Manuel Miranda looses to Sacha Baron Cohen after his performance and for creating the landmark musical ""Hamilton."" to a tasteless clown in a fat suit I had to find out why and how?The Golden Globes are under a shadow of a suspected corruption investigation and are undue influence from media tycoons and I hope recent changes to The Golden Globes diversity of its membership will improve selection and categories in the future.I can't recommend Borat but some may get a laugh out of if ,not me.....",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

Credit where it's due; She has gone toe to toe with Sacha, even overshadowed him in quite a few sequences!

This combined Sacha's hilarious wit and humour with a heartwarming story.Definitely the most ""2020"" film I have seen. It was refreshing to see the events captured in typical Borat fashion. It was impossible not to smile, laugh or cringe throughout.It doesn't take itself too seriously. In a time where everyone is offended by everything and taking themselves way too seriously - that is damn refreshing.As a non-American, I'm a bit exhausted from being exposed to American politics. Borat's unique take on it all was a breath of fresh air. I have no idea how much is staged, scripted or whatever, but there were numerous memorable lines regardless.Probably not a film I'll watch again (who wants to revisit 2020?!), but it entertained me nonetheless.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

81,MrDHWong,Once again offers a hilarious critique on modern American culture with that signature satirical edge only a character actor like Sacha Baron Cohen could ever bring,8,29 October 2020,"""Borat Subsequent Moviefilm"" is the sequel to the 2006 mockumentary ""Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"". Starring Sacha Baron Cohen in the lead role, it once again offers a hilarious critique on modern American culture with that signature satirical edge only a character actor like him could ever bring.After the worldwide release of his first documentary film, Borat Sagdiyev (Sacha Baron Cohen) returns home to Kazakhstan to discover that he has humiliated his entire country in the process and is sent to the gulag for a lifetime of punishment. Fourteen years later, Borat is released at the request of the country's leader and tasked with delivering a renowned monkey to US President Donald Trump in an attempt to fix Kazakhstan's reputation. Realising that it would be impossible for him to reach Trump due to his actions in the first film, Borat instead decides to gift the monkey to Vice President Mike Pence. At the fear of being executed, Borat sets off on his second trip to US and A with the monkey in a container, unaware that his previously unknown daughter Tutar (Maria Bakalova) has stowed away on board.The original ""Borat"" film still holds a special place in my heart as one of my all time favourite comedies. I still have fond memories of quoting it verbatim and reenacting some scenes with friends when it first came out. I even cited the film as an example of a ""Journey"" as part of my final high school English exam. So it should come as no surprise that I was quite excited to hear that there would be a follow-up, especially considering Sacha Baron Cohen had previously stated that he would be retiring the character permanently a long time ago. With that in mind, I can say that this is definitely a sequel that we have needed more than ever. Considering how much America, and indeed the whole world for that matter, has changed in the past fourteen years, a character like Borat making his humorous, outdated observations certainly brings the humour in thick and fast as one by one his victims fall prey. Viewers of Baron Cohen's previous work should know what to expect when watching this film, as it is littered with some highly politically incorrect jokes and the odd use of gross-out humour. If this type of comedy offended you the first time around, then I guarantee it will offend you here as well. You have been warned.Due to the success of the original, Borat has become an enduring figure of pop culture, even after more than a decade. This would naturally make it difficult for a sequel to be made without people recognising the character in the streets, as part of what made him funny in the first place was the unsuspecting public believing him to be a real journalist from Kazakhstan. To work around this issue, we see Borat wearing disguises and speaking in a different accent when talking with some interviewees. Most of these were as funny as ever, although some of the aliases felt very hit-and-miss. That's not to say they weren't any less amusing, it's just that I preferred to see Borat himself talking to people and not some random man in a fat suit sporting a fake nose and speaking in an exaggerated Texan accent. In this film, we see Borat tackling subjects such as advances in technology, the sharp political divide in America, and of course the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns affecting the world. It's hard for me to discuss in detail the funniest parts without spoiling them so you'll just have to see for yourself. All I will say is that most of them are near the end.Even though he said in the past he would never play the character again, Sacha Baron Cohen seamlessly brings the loveable Kazakh journalist back as if he never left to begin with. All of his trademark quirks and catchphrases are there for us to enjoy, and he still has the power to shock us with his raw look at how things are in America right now. It is truly a great showcase of what a comic genius this man is and how we need more daring comedians like him to make us laugh and think of the current state of affairs in the world. However, I must also bring attention to newcomer Maria Bakalova as Borat's daughter Tutar. I'll admit I was concerned at first that she would be another typical female version of a male character shoehorned in to attract a broader audience but to my surprise she actually ended up stealing the show in quite a few scenes. Tutar's curiosity about the world beyond her home country made for some nice moments between father and daughter, as the former warms towards her and accepts that she is capable of so much more than just the traditional values she had been taught since birth. This added an air of sweetness to the film, albeit, in the comedic style one would expect here, but sweetness is still sweetness regardless.Although I think the original was marginally better, ""Borat Subsequent Moviefilm"" still packs that same comedic punch that provides the right amount of laughs in these trying times. It comes as a breath of fresh air to see a film like this taking potshots at subjects that most modern comedians are either too scared to touch or have given up on entirely. I don't know if we will ever get a third Borat film in the future but I also never imagined we'd get a second one either, yet here we are. If we do, it would probably take another fourteen or so years to complete, but for now, this hilarious second entry is a great success. High five!I rate it 8/10",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm
82,cardsrock,Very nice!,7,25 October 2020,"Sacha Baron Cohen and the makers of this moviefilm deserve a ton of credit for actually filming most of the scenes included here. Some of them are so over the top and insane you won't believe they're real. Borat is often hilarious and had me chuckling throughout most of the film. I think the beginning is the strongest, however the ending is pretty good. The plot is better than you would expect and the movie pushes it along fairly well. This movie likely won't age as well as the first one though given how focused on current events it is.It's essentially a piece of propaganda for the upcoming election, but that doesn't mean it isn't funny.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm
83,CANpatbuck3664,Better Than You Would Think But Still Extremely Hit or Miss,8,4 September 2021,"Borat returns and his aim is quite clear. This movie is decidedly lampooning the American right wing and the political shift in the U. S. This was going to ruffle feathers of course, but so did the original. This movie does have some bite but Cohen ties the noose and leads people to the gallows but he lets them do the dirty work by just flapping their gums. This doesn't work every time and when Subsequent Moviefilm falls flat, there are giant awkward moments that drag on. But he walks the line of making fun without directly insulting, some people will be offended and if you feel that way after watching this film, you're entitled to that opinion. But Cohen's slant worked more for me than it didn't.One of the things that caught me off guard about Borat's second adventure was that there was more tact in the plotting of narrative. The movie acknowledges Borat's impact on pop culture and despite plenty of early insults towards Tutar for her gender, there's an undercurrent about feminism and equality. Its not expertly woven into the plot but I appreciated its inclusion and I tip my cap to the writers for not choosing to go for the low hanging fruit (at least some of the time).I think Cohen's a talented actor and comedian, he just doesn't function in any production or work with any type of material. He has more vigour in his own productions and while he doesn't land every shot he takes, he still makes contact more often than he doesn't. I also think he has good chemistry with Maria Bakalova who was quite the find as Borat's daughter Tutar. This is a breakout kind of performance, I'm not saying she's the next Emma Stone or Jennifer Lawrence but she somehow is able to keep up with Cohen and they make a consistently funny comedic team.Sacha Baron Cohen is a force of nature as this character. I don't know if he really knows what's tasteful or not, he just lumbers through the scene and like a wrecking ball, he knocks down everything. Its all up to what's funny for you and what's going to offend you. I was laughing hard during certain scenes of this movie and cringing at others. But I do believe this movie was better than it had any right to be, I was fearful that Baron Cohen was just finally cashing in on what was left of Borat's popularity. He proved me wrong though and he deserves credit for putting together a good sequel. I don't know if I'd recommend making a 3rd one, I'd let it lie here. Check this out if you enjoyed the first one or didn't get absolutely sick of Borat's schtick from the first one.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

87,ronakkotian,Nowhere near as good as its predecessor but still a good sequel,7,24 October 2020,"I love Borat. I remember seeing the first film and thinking it was the funniest film I've ever seen so naturally I was excited for the sequel. It's nowhere near as good as the first film but I still enjoyed it.Borat Subsequent Moviefilm shows Borat fourteen years later after the success of the first film where he has to gift his daughter to Vice President Mike Pence.It came as a shock to me when it was announced that Borat 2 has already been shot, edited and shown to various people. As a huge fan of Borat I got excited but knew deep inside that it wasn't gonna come close to the first film and I was correct. Borat Subsequent Moviefilm doesn't match the hilarity of its predecessor but at the same time I still laughed a pretty good amount during this film. There are still some very funny and shocking gags and, like the first film, there is a lot of political and social commentary that makes America seem really bad but what I didn't expect was how emotional the film was going to be. Aside from the jokes and commentary, this is really a father-daughter story which some people may not like if they're going into this movie expecting a ton of funny pranks. The father-daughter story does have its heartfelt moments and builds on both characters and creates arcs for them but the structure is really predictable and cliché.After viewing the trailer, I was really worried about the daughter character but I feel Maria Bakalova really stood out in this film. She really surprised me at how great she was and her ability to keep up with Cohen is commendable. Once again, Sacha Baron Cohen nails Borat and it feels VERY NICE to see him back in the role. Both of them have a strong dynamic with each other and that helped massively during the more heartfelt scenes.It's great how relevant this film is right now but if I were to see it again a few years down the line, the film may feel outdated. I don't think the film's topics like COVID-19 will hold up as well as it does now. What I loved about the first film was its timeless nature and that's why I'm still able to enjoy it no matter how many times I've seen it.I have my issues with Borat Subsequent Moviefilm but above all, I still had a great time watching it and I think it's one of the better sequels I've seen. It doesn't have as much replay value as its predecessor but I wouldn't mind seeing it again.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

89,andrewroy-04316,"Just like its predecessor, this is a funny and smart satire of American society",7,26 October 2020,"Borat Subsequent Moviefilm definitely has the same feel as the original, though it is certainly less of a broad exploration of American culture than a very pointed political satire aimed at the current election. It may be less timeless than the first due to its emphasis on Trump and the current political climate, but I also think the clarity works well for its purpose. We get the same style of jokes here - Borat meeting various types of people and seeing many of the flaws and prejudices held by Americans. Much of the film is spent with two Trump supporters and later parts of the film center on Giuliani, and the ending really drives home the message that even people from the backwards nation of Kazakhstan recognize the idiocy of the current administration and many of its racist supporters. I also thought the COVID-based twist in the film was funny and worked very well. The biggest star of the show, though, is actually Borat's daughter, played by Bakalova. She is absolutely fantastic, which I imagine is even harder to do when some of the characters weren't acting. There are a lot more jokes here centered on Kazakh backwardness, particularly regarding women (for example, I didn't find the jokes about the book to be that great), which are the ones I liked least about the first and feel the same here. Most of its scenes focused on satirizing modern America, however, are fantastic. The Trump supporters, the Giuliani and Pence scenes, and the ending all work really well. Also, while it wasn't really a political joke, the scene talking about getting the baby out of her was the funniest bit from either of the movies. Just like the first, it has its hits and its misses, but at the end of the day it's a comedy with lots of funny moments and plenty of interesting ideas and scenes.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm
90,mjsreg,Very funny,7,23 October 2020,"Sacha Baron Cohen's revival of our favourite Kazakh reporter is another stroke of genius, and Maria Bakalova adds to the fun as Borat's daughter, playing a brilliant role.Although not as racy as the first film (probably due to legal lessons learned) this is still typical Borat for the fans.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm
91,PyroSikTh,"Better Than ""Cultural Learnings for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan""",8,4 November 2020,"Subsequent Moviefilm follows the same basic premise as the first movie; Sacha Baron Cohen dresses up as an outlandish character and travels across America pranking real American citizens, and revealing the true nature of normal people, from the good to the bad. This time however, instead of chasing after Pamela Anderson, Borat has his daughter with him, and hopes to marry her off to one of Trump's political allies in order to earn a better reputation for glorious nation of Kazakhstan. This results in a much more interesting and engaging story, and gives us another character to get to know and really root for. Azamat, the producer in the first movie, was never given much attention as a character. He was just someone for Borat to feed off of. But Tutar is not treated the same way, and even has her own character arc and her own chances to prank people. Not to mention the twists and turns brought on by current events that were moulded into the story so effortlessly it's hard to believe they started filming this last year before everything hit the fan. Not only is the pandemic slotted in so seamlessly, but it manages to elevate the movie - from a narrative standpoint - far above anything else Baron Cohen has done.Of course Borat is all about the pranks, and while the tighter narrative of the movie does make the whole affair feel a lot more scripted, it's no less funnier for it (in fact it might debatably be funnier, but we'll get there in a minute). Definite highlights include Tutar's time with the Jeanise, the babysitter, who thought she was participating in a real documentary about teenage brides. What she puts up with from newcomer Maria Bakalova is astounding, and she comes across as the most effortlessly caring and wholesome person, doing what she can to change Tutar's worldview. She's also low-key hilarious by herself, such as her reaction to Tutar calling the Earth flat, or the way she points out that breast implants are not going to change much in Tutar's life. Another entirely wholesome highlight is Borat's 5-day stay with a couple of redneck guys who, while clearly misinformed themselves, do all they can to educate Borat. These are guys who think Coronavirus is fake, and avoid liberal people as much as they can, and yet they take a complete stranger into their home when he had nowhere to stay (at least to their knowledge), and offer assistance however they can. Baron Cohen dressed as Trump bursting in on a speech by Mike Pence, the constant back-and-forth with a poor postman and his fax machine, and the pair going to a pro-life health centre to remove a candy baby from Tutar are hilarious as well, while the Women's Club and Debutante scenes are prime cuts of cringe and embarrassment.Between all of that and the more traditional comedy moments between Borat and Tutar, I would argue Subsequent Movefilm is a far funnier movie than the first Borat. The first had its moments for sure, but Subsequent Moviefilm is almost relentless with its jokes. It not only aims higher, but hits higher as well. The more obviously scripted nature of the film is bound to turn off some die-hard fans, but for me it meant the jokes were really worked on and refined in order to be as funny as they could possibly be. The best example of this is the Disney-parody of Melania Trump, and her first meeting with Trump, all in Disney-style cartoon. And then was the song Borat performs really written by the rednecks? I doubt it; it has Baron Cohen all over it. But that didn't make his performance of it at the anti-mask rally any less hilarious to watch.
But of course being a Borat movie, there's more here than just the comedy. Beneath the jokes and pranks is more of a look at the highs and lows of American society. I've already mentioned how wholesome both the black babysitter and the rednecks were despite their political viewpoints, but it swings the other way as well. The pastor at the women's health centre barely bats an eye at the implication that Borat impregnated his daughter, and in light of those revelations, still refuses Tutar's right to an abortion. Not to mention the numerous occasions of unashamed creeps like the plastic surgeon who admits he would take advantage of Tutar was Borat not present, or Guiliani himself who did not come off in a particularly great light even before the moment of controversy. Then there's the frightening situations of mob mentality Borat encounters, such as his prank on Mike Pence being met with the crowd chanting ""four more years"", or his racist, misogynistic, and anti-Semitic song being welcomed and cheered on by a crowd of anti-maskers. Baron Cohen said himself that he was forced to wear a bulletproof vest on a couple of occasions, something he was never required to do for the first film.Some of this movie will not age well, most notably anything relating to coronavirus (which ended up being nearly half the movie), while other moments (again coronavirus related) have aged like a fine wine already. Baron Cohen appears so much more at home in the character of Borat than he ever was in the first movie, resulting in his pranks being so much more effective, as well his general acting making the whole affair a lot more convincing. Unfortunately for him, he discovered Maria Bakalova who is astonishing and gives it her all. There was not a single moment she wasted, and she committed one hundred percent to every gag and every prank, not only keeping up with Baron Cohen, but sometimes completely blowing him out of the water. Some people will hate the increased sense of script, while I feel the movie benefited greatly from it, and it's still chock full of candid improv moments to keep it as Borat as always. I enjoyed this a lot more than the first movie, like it's not even close. I could definitely see myself watching this again in the near future. I give it a very high 8/10 (so high I genuinely debated giving it a 9).",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm
92,sweidman-28016,Just As Funny As the First,7,11 November 2020,"""Finally the time had come to deliver my daughter to the vice p*ssy-grabber.""It wasn't till last week that I actually saw Borat. Those types of movies just never really interested me, but I thought it might be time to see what all the fuss was about. I guess I understand now. It's funny and all well done I just don't think it's as amazing as everyone else does. That being said, this one became necessary for me to see after the first. This must be the year for relevant movies. I'm honestly shocked at how many topics they covered. And they're all done well. With the addition of Maria Bakalova they could achieve so much more with not only topics but also recognition with acting. When I tell you she could actually go let an Oscar nomination I'm not joking in the slightest. I'm just as surprised as everyone else it. When I saw her name come in the top ten actress contenders I didn't understand why. But wow! She took her role to a whole new level. As good as Sacha Baron Cohen is as Borat, he's overshadowed by Bakalova.The first act really had me thinking this was better than the first. Again with the topics the covered, the execution is done so well. Whether it's a comical or serious situation there's wonderful recognition to each subject. At the halfway point it seemed they did all they could. The movie slumps down there into just an ok movie. Towards the end of the third act it does pick up but never to the level of greatness that is the first act. This is a pretty straightforward movie. It's absolutely hilarious and a great time. I don't have much else to say but I think this is a fun movie and would recommend it to anyone who can handle vulgar humor or just anyone who loves a good comedy.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm
93,ethanbresnett,"Underwhelming considering the hype, but worth watching",7,5 November 2020,"A little disappointing I must say. I watched the first Borat a long time ago, so my opinion of it may be inflated, but I didn't feel the sequel lived up to the first at all.Firstly though the positives. Sacha Baron Cohen is fantastic, and so watchable. He pours so much into the character of Borat, fully commits, and it's easily his best creation. Most of the laughs come from him as you'd expect, but the real surprise is from Maria Bakalova as Borat's daughter Tutar. How she managed to steal the show when she was across from Sacha, let alone being a debutant is incredible! She was the best part of the film for me. I think she brought so much life to the film, and was a genius move from Sacha to mix things up and bring a new element to the story, which was at risk or being a straightforward rehash of the first.Speaking of the story, it was decent. The underlying premise was pretty funny, and there were numerous moments throughout which were inspired. This is definitely more satirical than the first, and has more of a message, purpose and relevance I feel. It's a nice zippy screenplay which keeps you entertained. The humour is exactly what you'd expect if you've seen Borat. It's a mixture of crass toilet humour, intelligent humour and some solid political satire thrown in too as you'd expect given the circumstances surrounding this film. It was never as funny as the first in my opinion, although there were some great standout moments (the scene at the ball springs to mind).The negatives aren't really anything specific, it just didn't wow me and was never side splittingly funny.Borat 2 is very much a film for 2020, and if nothing else felt like a much needed tonic in these times. It's definitely worth watching, but doesn't reach the highs of its predecessor.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

Of course, Texas and Oklahoma feature prominently in this! It's also because I laughed quite a bit, mostly at the above stupid people. The addition of Borat's daughter works well! The only thing I noticed, for me, is that the shock value from the first movie wasn't in this one. I guess after 4 years of 45's racist, misogynist, anti-American tweets and mumblings, I've grown accustomed to that party's lies and rhetoric. Sad.As a side note, the Rudy Giuliani piece is horribly disturbing. Again, sadly not surprising, but horribly disgusting. I hope he, and his president, end up in jail.

100,ericrnolan,"A FEW QUICK WORDS ON ""BORAT SUBSEQUENT MOVIEFILM"" (2020)",10,28 October 2020,"If you want to debate the ethics of Sacha Baron Cohen's prank-driven comedy, maybe there's a conversation to be had. The people subjected to his ""Candid-Camera""-meets-""Jackass,"" politically charged, ambush-style comedy are typically very unhappy about it. And I realize that Cohen (like any one else) should not be immune to criticism.But the man's work is damned hilarious; you can't argue with that. Like 2006's ""Borat,"" this new film made me laugh out loud repeatedly (even if I cringed at times too). ""Borat Subsequent Moviefilm"" is simply a first-rate comedy; I'd rate it a 10 out of 10.This is due largely to Cohen's twofold genius. First, he succeeds in creating a truly funny fictional character that could easily make us laugh in a scripted TV sitcom, or a ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch. Second, Cohen again demonstrates his mind-boggling ability to gain the trust of his targets - and then manages to stay in character throughout the elaborate pranks. (If you think about it, it's probably tougher than we might realize. There can't be any second takes for what we see unfolding before us onscreen.)A movie like this easily might have suffered from the addition of a second comedian who isn't as funny as Cohen. But newcomer Maria Bakalova hits it out of the park. (She plays the fictional daughter of Cohen's titular bumbling foreigner.) She is nearly as funny (and just as good at keeping character) as he is. With Sacha Baron Cohen, that's saying a lot.Again, some of what you see in this film will be cringe-inducing. But it's damned funny stuff.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

This much anticipated sequel is more raw and honest than the first. I mention this because you might not laugh as hard as you did in 2006, but what SBC brings to viewers is his sharp insight to a misguided American culture. This sequel is less documentary and more of a firm storyline. SBC is without a a doubt a master of his craft and huge props to him for finding newcomer Maria Balakova, who plays his daughter. Balakova if anything, steals the film. She's hilarious and her antics are acute and unexpected. If you think the Giuliani incident is bad; that's just the tip of the iceberg. It's takes balls to make a film of this nature during a pandemic but only SBC could pull something like this off.

106,Med-Jasta,Heart was in the right place...,5,2 November 2020,But it was just okay. Not enough laughs and too much plot. The story was constantly shifting. At 20 minutes in I felt like I had seen a whole movie. And while I completely agree with the message it drove the story too much. And will probably be obsolete in like 2 years.If felt like they knew what message they wanted to say by didn't really have the right story or way to get it across. Or at least with all of their unscripted scenes they didn't really get what they were going for.The are a handful of good laughs in there but they're insurmountable compared to the first. Actually if this wasn't a sequel to one of the funniest movies ever I would have shut it off pretty early. I just kept waiting for great stuff and only got some.They were creative about how to disguise Borat. But ultimately I think this really took away from the movie. They didn't get the freedom to do what they did in the first movie and had to limit themselves. The comedy of disguised Borat goes away pretty quickly.It was pretty unsettling to actually see the heart of Trump America. Of course I know that these people are out there and have read stuff they say but to actually see it coming out of their mouths made me more afraid of the human race then I already am.

Maybe the only authentic scene was the one with Giuliani and Bakalova at the end of the movie, that is very controversial and so much discussed on the internet. A different approach to the script that I have personally appreciated. The movie is very actual, they managed to speak a little bit about the global pandemic and to make fun of conspiracy theories.

Well what can I say Borat 2 was bonkers and insane, but mostly brilliant, clever and had a lot more heart than the first film, so let's get started.First of all the movie was very funny, had great comedic performances and chemistry as well as a fun set up. This movie was absolutely hilarious, even more outrageously funny than the first film, there was so many funny comedy skits, highlighting and cleverly taking the mick out of a lot of republicans and how they have handled many things, it's humour was even more clever, and due to everything that's going on right now gave even more comedic opportunities and satire for Borat to be involved with. The comedic performance from Sacha Baron Cohen was also as expected fantastic, he bought the character of Borat back to life perfectly with fantastic dialogue and his form of comedy and his comedic timing was excellent here, but also Maria Bakalova was fantastic here as well, she held her own with Sacha and in some places was even more funny than him, they both had excellent chemistry with each other and watching there relationship develop was great. The set up for the movie was also very fun, having the view of Kazakhstan being the complete opposite and Borat being forced out of the country set up the main plot point and new characters well, and was a creative way to develop the story.My only negative for the movie would be that they went slightly too far with some of the comedy. I did feel like the movie went slightly over the line with certain skits and costumes that felt more offensive than funny for me in places, the movie usually does a great job at being controversial but still able to get away with it, but I definitely think they went slightly too far in a couple of places.My final few positives would be the themes, links to real people, costumes and heartwarming moments. The movie had really great themes of really showing you how extreme and horrible a lot of Trump supporters opinions are and was a shocking but needed insight into the political divide in America, the links to real life people like Melania Trump or the random name drops and cameos for comedic effect were excellent and cleverly executed. The costume designs for Borat were also excellent and funny, due to the success of the first film Sacha was being recognised more by the public, so hats off to the costume team for providing very convincing and often hilarious costumes for Borat to wear. Finally the movie had a lot more heartwarming moments than the first film, the themes of women being capable of anything and that everyone is human and not so different was handled really well, with some genuinely kind and caring people involved within the film that was very sweet to watch.Overall Borat 2 a subsequent movie film, despite going slightly too far in places, is just as clever, outrageous and hilarious as the first film with a great new member of the cast and more heart than the first film.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

The plot was intriguing eventhough It was crazy, but that's what made it intriguing. There were a few funny moments, but not as much as the first movie; it could be because people are more sensitive nowadays.

117,TheCorniestLemur,Great success,8,25 October 2020,"This was far better than I expected it to be. I had fears that this would be too self-referential, too unnecessary, too much like the first film...the list goes on. But somehow, after the character becoming an icon of the 2000's, and virtually everyone knowing who Borat is, the one and only Sacha Baron Cohen somehow managed to make another feature length display of idiots being duped.And that might be the most impressive thing about it. If you're worried this won't be as wacky or as revealing of American culture as the first Borat, worry not. And yet again, somehow...not a single time does Sacha break character. Somehow. And he's just as entertaining to watch as he was the first time around.And yet again, the only major characters who know exactly what they're in are just Borat and Tutar, who is an AMAZING addition. They play off each other really well, she's never annoying, and Maria Bakalova can easily hold her own in terms of craziness and complete lack of social awkwardness, even against Sacha. And I really wasn't expecting to care much about her and Borat's relationship, but they even managed to pull that off too.Admittedly, this doesn't have quite the same timelessness of the original film, nor is it as shocking, by its very nature, but it was certainly very welcome in the present, even if it might not be in the future.Oh, and who exactly is filming Borat this time?",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

120,TheVictoriousV,Borat picked precisely the right time to return,7,23 October 2020,"When Sacha Baron Cohen puts on his mask, he removes everyone else's. Often mistaken for mere racist caricatures, his stereotypical characters serve to confirm the biases of his unwitting documentary subjects (usually the voting American public and sometimes the very officials they've elected), effectively catfishing them into revealing even uglier sides of themselves.Unfortunately, his character of Borat is too well-known (and over-quoted) to make another pseudo-realist ""prank film"" without getting caught. That is, at least under the Borat Sagdiyev moniker (even as his latest film was produced pretty secretively). What if, oh I dunno... Borat himself was to put on disguises?As confirmed by 2018's Who is America, Cohen does still know how to dupe voters, celebs, and public figures into unleashing their worst selves, and this extra-layered bit of trickery is no exception. Following the early screenings, Cohen's latest prank was already making headlines, having caught ex-mayor and cybersecurity advisor Rudy Giuliani in the act of doing something not-much-better than that which he himself has attempted to ruin the Biden family for.In the movie, Borat's near-feral and supposedly underaged daughter, Tutar (Maria Bakalova), joins the Kazakhstani reporter on his second trek to the United States, meeting such figures as Mike Pence and the aforementioned Giuliani on the way. Thing is, since Giuliani is one of Cohen's victims, he is not a part of the film's fiction (the same way Borat and his daughter are) - thus, when taking Tutar's in-universe age as fact and nevertheless ""enjoying"" her in his sleeping quarters, he isn't acting. Even if you don't share Cohen's biases, Giuliani having this sort of kerfuffle is a gloriously poetic bit of comedy.I don't know that this boner (pun intended) will delegitimize criticisms of the Biden family, but I feel a great swell of pity for Giuliani, mainly because his top defenders include Mike Cernovich, ever selective with when he chooses to call out pedophilia (jokes on Twitter is usually what does it; not the actual act). In a defense of Giuliani, Cernovich asked why we don't investigate Cohen - who, in the same footage, also seemed to believe Bakalova was no more than 15 and still made it possible that Giuliani brought her to his bed (by writing it so that Tutar will do anything to become ""next Queen Melania"").First of all, the actress isn't actually 15. Second of all, Cohen was in-character as Borat, who does have a 15-year-old daughter in the form of the character portrayed by said actress. The only party who conceivably believed that Tutar was a real-life minor is the politician who tried to f-ck her, i.e. the person currently being defended by ""righteous, free-thinking reporters"".Basically, Cohen continues to stand out among contemporary comics. Matt Zoller Seitz summarized the film's mission as ""positioning its hero as a depraved, narcissistic fool whose flaws and excesses mirror his clueless targets' so closely that they don't realize they're being made fun of, even when Cohen stops just short of hauling out a sign that reads, 'YOU ARE THE JOKE'."" He also eloquently describes the film's ultimate point on America: ""For all its posturing as The Greatest Nation on Earth, the United States circa 2020 has more in common with a retrograde foreign backwater than its government or people like to admit.""Much of Cohen's Borat shtick has always been about how, on top of pretending to affirm the beliefs of bigots, the bogeyman said bigots like to rail against isn't that far removed from themselves (in terms of how they view gender roles or religion or whatever), which becomes especially obvious when they actually start BONDING with the Borat figure. Notice how I've gone this far without mentioning mankinis or goofy catchphrases (or the beautifully idiotic way in which Borat combats the Coronavirus). Just so the detractors (and certain fans) are clear that there's more to this IP than they realize.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm
121,jackgdemoss,Impressive execution and some crude laughs,8,24 October 2020,"Borat 2 was laugh out loud funny at times, but certainly not enough to warrant an 8/10. The story actually had some coherence rather than feeling like a prank show and even had some solid emotion, but that still can't account for its 8/10 status. What drove it up for me was how expertly executed these secret filmings must have been. Sure everyone has to sign a release to show their face in the film afterwards, but to corner some people to the point that they want/need to is mind boggling.

Even the character of Borat has become annoying and unfunny and the often hilarious, liberating bad taste of the original is replaced here with a depressingly sour tone and is more repulsive than amusing. Cohen has seemingly lost his appeal and comedic talent.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm
123,harrylosborne,"Less of a comedy, more of an examination",3,29 October 2020,"I didn't really think I was going to enjoy this Borat revival, but I was quietly optimistic, given the generally positive reviews circulating online. I have in hindsight realised that they were speaking well of this film not for the humour (which is crass and lazy for the most part), but for its political commentary on the current state of the USA. Despite this, Borat is still far from a good film, leaning on some terrible comedy and its reputation for commercial success.In a similar vein to its predecessor, Borat Subsequent Moviefilm is a film that mocks itself, belittling genders, races and personal beliefs over the meagre 1.5 hour runtime. I know this is the point, but it doesn't make watching any easier: particular jokes (one aimed at the Jewish community and another based around female puberty) were actually painful to witness, getting more of an embarrassed response than anything else. Behind these set pieces were some legitimately clever moments and even some properly written gags, but it wouldn't be worth sitting through the dreg to get to them.In spite of this, the clever aspect of Borat is in his unassuming nature. By being naive and clueless (and at times extremist in his views), he lulls Americans into a false sense of security, which allows some insightful moments. My personal favourites included managing to extricate a Nazi salute from a Republican voter, whilst another showed the brutally honest misogyny of a southern man at a Debutante Ball. There is technically a ""story"" to this film as well, but it's a stretch to call it worth paying attention to. Something that really irked me was the excessive green-screening used: clearly the budget did not extend to sending the cast and crew all over the globe, but not even having the energy to build a low-budget set on-site just looks careless to me.All in all, Borat was not good. It wasn't very clever, it wasn't very funny, but more than anything, it didn't tell me anything about the crazy parts of the USA I didn't already know. In reality, you'd be better off watching the Youtube channel ""All Gas No Brakes"" - political humour, whilst leaving the crass jokes at the door.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

133,hunter-friesen,"""Borat 2"" is a funny retread",6,20 November 2020,"Back in 2006, Sacha Baron Cohen shocked the world with his hilarious mockumentary called ""Borat."" Playing the titular fake news reporter from Kazakhstan, Cohen toured America interviewing people from all walks of life. Through the character of Borat, Cohen showed Americans what they truly look like to the outside world: a bunch of overconfident and arrogant snobs that are too dumb to know how dumb they are. The film was an enormous success critically and commercially, which fueled rumors of a sequel for over a decade.Now in 2020, Cohen is back as Borat Sagdiyev. ""Borat Subsequent Moviefilm"" or if you want to go by the official title ""Borat Subsequent Moviefilm: Delivery of Prodigious Bribe to American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan,"" picks up where the last one left off. Borat has just been released from the Kazakh gulags and is being sent back to America. Once there, he will deliver a special gift (it's best I don't tell you what it is) to Michael Pence to regain America's trust and loyalty towards Kazakhstan.What I just described to you is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the weirdness within this ""moviefilm."" Borat's mission is also just a shameless excuse for the character to return to America to do what he does best.But instead of being joined by his producer Azamat like in the first film, Borat is accompanied by his daughter Tutar, who knows next to nothing of the world outside her village and is accustomed to being told that women are not smart enough to read, have a job or drive a car. This is all played for laughs, but it also does mock the seemingly backward gender norms found in parts of the world. Similar to Borat in the first movie, Tutar's visit to the home of the brave will be quite the culture shock.Once there, Borat is quickly recognized by everyday citizens. Knowing that being an instantly recognizable star will jeopardize his mission, he must don an assortment of disguises as he makes his way across the states. He makes stops at the Conservative Political Action Conference, an anti-mask rally and even catches Rudy Guliani doing some questionable acts, for which he has had to defend in the previous weeks.""Borat Subsequent Moviefilm"" is a lot like the leftovers you take home after a good restaurant meal. It's still good, but it's not as good as it was before and the only thing you can think about while eating it is how much you enjoyed the first meal. Most of the ""pranks"" that Cohen pulls off as Borat seem to be much more scripted in this go around. Much of the fun of the first film came from the loose and improvised feel. This sequel is much more calculated in what it is trying to say and how it goes about doing it.This feeling of been-there-done-that isn't completely Cohen's fault. Unlike back in 2006, Americans have finally started to come around to the idea that we aren't so special after all. Maybe it's because of who we have (or had, depending on when this review is published in relation to the election) in the oval office or the idiotic way we are handling the pandemic. 2020 Americans don't need another reminder that this country kind of sucks. We see it in our news feeds every day as we try to navigate the broken social ladder.Despite being unneeded on a story level, ""Borat Subsequent Moviefilm"" is a needed reminder of just how talented Sacha Baron Cohen is as he does what he was put on this world to do. This is his brand of comedy that no one comes close to competing in. Whether he's dressed as Borat, a southern trucker, an extremely antisemitic portrayal of a Jewish man or Donald Trump himself, Cohen seamlessly slips into character and has you fooled instantaneously.However, the MVP of this movie is not Cohen, but Maria Bakalova, who plays Tutar. Bakalova follows the same trajectory as Cohen did in the first movie as she expertly pulls off the naivety of a sheltered girl in a lawless land. She also carries the emotional arc of the story as her relationship with her father flourishes with each subsequent hijink.""Borat Subsequent Moviefilm"" is a perverse and vulgar film that holds a mirror up to America. While the original was fresh and inventive, this follow-up is just more of the same with less luster. But, far worse movies have gotten far worse sequels, so we should count ourselves lucky that this sequel is redeemed by the comic genius of Sacha Baron Cohen and Maria Bakalova.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm
134,arabnikita,Doesn't come close to the original but still has its hilarious moments,6,24 October 2020,"Jagshemash! In this movie, Borat goes back to America to save his country, prevent his execution and discover how the world has changed in 14 years. While this sequel is above many of our modern comedies, it doesn't come remotely close to the original for two reasons. The movie's main plot is too heavily focused on Trump, his buddies and politics overall which makes it feel boring and dry. The segments outside of the ""main narrative"" are hilarious in all the right ways but most of them feel scripted and inorganic.It is a challenging task to follow up the success, freshness and openness of Borat 1, specially considering that now he is a known character who has to wear disguises. The sequel does have a few ""wild"" moments, but overall it feels toned down and scripted. The Borat of old had zero filter and would tell things as they are to anyone he met not caring if he would offend anyone. People around him would show genuine reactions without acting like caricatures. This is what fans liked about the original and while the spirit is partially there, it doesn't feel as strong.Nevertheless, I still found a lot to enjoy about the movie and would definitely recommend it if you have seen the original. The plot is just as moronic as before with Borat and his daughter doing a lot of crazy things. The film is tightly packed and has many hilarious moments; not to mention an unexpected twist in the end which makes everything even funnier. Despite the boring political focus, it tries to touch up on as many things as possible like technology, feminism and Corona.

136,MinistryofDoom,A fantastic way to mark the ridiculous state of US Politics,6,23 January 2021,"Borat 2 was a strange film. After doing the first one and being exposed for your hidden camera antics, how do you repeat that formula without everyone getting suspicious? Well, Somehow Sacha Baron Cohen was able to do just that because, as his sequel, ""Borat Subsequent Moviefilm....."" proves, there are just way too many gullible idiots in the world.Borat 2 (for short), is a ridiculous film. It takes the hidden camera antics of the first one and ratchets it up while focusing primarily on all the political insanity that hast permeated the US since 2016. Unfortunately, while the hidden camera sections are hilarious, the overarching narrative was utterly stupid. I would have enjoyed it more without the dumb story about Borat and his daughter, but I also understand that this sub-plot was the catalyst that launched the film and connected all little skits and bits together. Some of the hidden camera scenes were so outlandish and jaw dropping that I had a hard time believing that they were not scripted. I don't understand how in this day and age, some of the people would volunteer such thoughts and ideas aloud. In particular, the scenes involving celebrities should be insta-career killers. After you're featured in a Borat film, there's no going back from that. Sacha Baron Cohen goes to great lengths to avoid being discovered by relying on the use of his co-host, Maria Bakalova, who plays his daughter to capture them in hilarious ways. It shines a light on the ridiculous nature of US politics, especially when it pokes fun at Donald Trump, Mike Pence, and their administration. One stand out scene involves ""America's Mayor"" Rudy Giuliani. How he managed to survive the fallout of this film is beyond me.With the Pandemic still raging, the economy is tatters, and the state of Washington in total chaos, if you need a chance to let loose and laugh a little, or alot, Borat 2 is your film.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

143,EddyTheMartian007,Did Borat just save 2020?!,7,23 October 2020,"(No Spoilers) Borat Subsequent Moviefilm: Delivery of Prodigious Bride to American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (2020) is a sequel to the cultural phenomenon that was the first film, Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (2006). I think it's safe to say most of us never expected this movie to happen, let alone be secretly filmed and release just a couple of months after its announcement. I also think it is safe to assume that most of us didn't think a sequel would be as good as the original. It would just be impossible to recapture the shocking satirical mockumentary that was the first one, but it's almost as shocking a sequel would be made today with all the political correctness, cancel culture, etc. that has become so prevalent in today's media. While this movie is definitely not as good as the original and some of its charm is lost since it has been already done before, and replicated, it still remains hilarious yet important.Sacha Baron Cohen still owns the role perfectly being as believable as the current pandemic. There's times where Sacha is acting as Borat, acting as an American, and it's as impressive as it is hilarious. The surprise star is Maria Bakalova as Tutar, Borat's daughter. When I first saw her character I was apprehensive as she seemed like she could become annoying fast, but she never was, and is the heart of the film. The movie definitely goes in cliched and predictable routes, despite the unpredictable pranks they pull, but they somehow make it work. This is definitely one of those movies I can see being even more divisive than the first. While the first was mostly loved it created a lot of controversy for its depiction of Kazakhstan, gross scenes, and its dark/offensive humor. Now add current day American politics, and a criticism of multiple hot button issues today, it will definitely leave some people sour. Plus, not everyone will enjoy the father daughter story if they're mainly here for the funny pranks, but if you stick with the story it will be greatly rewarding.This movie relies on shock humor so I won't be spoiling anything here. A Borat sequel could've easily failed if it didn't do a few things differently, and I think this movie succeeded. With Borat's cultural impact we've already seen similar movies and even TV shows recreate it, most notably The Eric Andre Show (which is equally as hilarious in my opinion), so this movie makes the smart move of focusing a little more on the actual story and characters of the film. This allows for the movie to have more of an emotional impact, and even moments of tension. There's a particular part where I found it to be genuinely intense. Maria Bakalova deserves insane praise for what she was able to accomplish going so deep into her role to even expose a real politician. We've heard about politicians doing these things for years, but seeing it happen, it was just gut wrenching. While the first film shows a broader view of US&A, this movie examines on a wider variety of topics and effectively criticizes them.Borat, once again, and Tutar achieve much success giving us a powerful social commentary of our times, but it does have some issues. As I mentioned earlier the storyline and character arcs are cliched and predictable. Borat Subsequent Moviefilm: Delivery of Prodigious Bride to American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (2020) simply isn't as funny as the first film, Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (2006). While it still had me consistently laughing out loud throughout, there wasn't any moment where I was almost in tears from laughter like the first film. The social commentary works but isn't as effective like the first time around where it genuinely caught us off guard and made us pause to examine ourselves. All of these issues have already been heavily criticized and satirized, so it isn't as powerful as it could be. The first movie almost feels timeless, still applying to this day, but this movie focuses on issues (like COVID-19) right now that might not age well. There's a fantastic unpredictable twist near the end of the movie that really adds to the story, but I found the the actual ending to be a bit too silly even for Borat, using tired jokes that have been said by everyone already.Despite all these problems, I still had a great time. Did Borat 2 save 2020? No, I don't think anything can, but it is certainly one of the only gifts to come from this unbelievable and wretched year. Overall, Borat 2 very nice, deserves High Five! It is the still hilarious satirical dark humor we need today more than ever. It exposes our society, while still having a heart, and with 2 fantastic lead performances. Thank you for reading my review. I hope you like. Dziekuje!(7/10)",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

It's a hard thing to do and it's hard to follow an extremely well known film and even more so after such a long time gap.This film does try its best to complete and it does for the most part. It's still funny and still had this biting commentary on certain people in America. These people that it finds are truly nasty and the things they say are terrible and it finds away to get them to say these things on camera and expose them self to the world.It's always going to be funny watching people squirm when they are faced with uncomfortable situations so it has that but where it falters is the scripted parts with the two leads, they are just dead air.

All he ever does is dress up like some weird character and pretend to be dumb in the hope of tricking people into saying embarrassing things. What I really hate is that a lot of the people he tricks are just being nice and even trying to help him, but, he tries to frame it in such a way that they look like bad people. It is all just so his clique of liberal cosmopolitan elites can look down on Muslims and Christians. I will admit that Cohen is smart and capable of being funny, but, he is not as smart or funny as he thinks he is. I watched this with my family (who loved the first movie) and they did not laugh once during this film. It is all basically the same formula and really forced. I imagine this will get quite good reviews because he attacks Trump and most critics will love that, but, this is not a good movie.

153,theredsky,Borat Subsequent Moviefilm Review,7,26 October 2020,"A great sequel to an already excellent movie. Borat 2 is a great follow up to one of my favorite comedies of all time. Obviously, Sachs Baron Cohen is hilarious as Borat but I was surprised at how great of a job newcomer Maria Bakalova did as Borat's daughter. She is essentially the heart and soul of the film and did an excellent job playing off of Borat. The film's writing is once again excellent at showing off Cohen's comedic talents and showing the state of the United States in 2020. The film's story is excellent and I was incredibly impressed at how they incorporated the Covid-19 pandemic into the film. Quarantine started during the making of this film and they quickly rewrote the script and incredibly and expertly wove the pandemic into the story. It was seamless and felt like something they had planned from day 1. Something great that Borat 2 does is show the current state of the United States. They are a lot of jabs at the Trump administration which could/will turn some people off from the film but it's hilarious and thought provoking none the less. There is a moment towards the end of the film with a certain politician that's horrible. Not that the film is horrible but what he does is horrible. Since this is a sequel to Borat, it has to be funny and it was definitely funny. I found myself laughing at a lot of moments in the film although I prefer the first film's jokes over this one. I really didn't have a lot of issues other than the occasional slow bit here and there. Go check this out when you can but if you consider yourself right leaning, you might not get as much enjoyment out of it as others would.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

I am a big fan of the first movie and I think where this one falls apart for me is that it focuses too much on current events (that the movie will probably be irrelevant in a few years), focuses way too much on politics and on the plot with Borat's daughter. Many people are praising her performance here. I think she's fine, but I don't think the script is anything special here and it doesn't help the actors. The scenes I enjoyed the most are those with Borat doing his thing by himself, but a lot of it felt to me like attempting to recreate the mood of the original.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

Unfunny, pathetic stunts and pranks and unfunny dialogue. The period scene for example and saying to a doctor he put a baby inside his daughter....just not funny, and I'm no prudeIts a liberal propaganda film pathetically half disguised as a 'comedy' yet theres nothing funny in Borat 2.Borat 2 is worlds away from the very funny original Borat.

Very Nice...Not!",2,24 October 2020,"Right, you've seen my rating, and you think you know what my problems with Borat 2 are. You think I'm one of those right wingers who badmouths any lefty circle jerk on principle alone. You're mistaken. I love Borat. The original film was a daring, unique, and crucially, uproariously funny mockumentary. I suppose the political aims of both the 2006 film and this new Borat picture are about the same; to shine a mocking light on those fat, backwards Americans by way of a really backwards Kazakhstani TV reporter. There was a sparkle of genius to Borat's first big screen outing; a satirical sharpness to compliment one of the funniest characters I had ever seen.The sequel... it's embarrassing. And not just because it regurgitates the same hackneyed Trumps jokes that induced groans three years ago. Borat 2 is also shockingly unfunny in the traditional sense. Its worst offense is the introduction of Borat's daughter, and by extension, a sappy father daughter bonding storyline that neutralizes the risqué edge the first Borat carried so well. Maria Bakalova is a terrible comedic actress; annoying, shrill, and obviously floundering in her attempts to curb Cohen's off the cuff improv style. She can't hack it, but the entire character is a huge dud. Borat's daughter comes across as some kind of focus-grouped feminine appeal token from the Cousin Oliver Writing School for Hacks Trying to Mix Things Up. She's so overwritten and obvious, there's just no joy in watching her up there on the screen. And the story suffers heartily in her wake. This film feels so much more scripted than its predecessor, unfolding into a tidy, predictable three-act road movie with some mockumentary interludes in between.And perhaps most disappointing of all is Sacha Baron Cohen as Borat. He doesn't seem to have it anymore. The voice doesn't sound right, the well-meaning enthusiasm is gone, and those quiet, subtle bits of brilliance are flatly abandoned. He's louder and broader than ever. It doesn't work.The spark of inspiration that first brought us Borat is long dead. This Subsequent Moviefilm is a straining, tired ordeal. It dutifully checks off each and every cardinal sin of a comedy sequel: clumsily trudging up jokes that worked before, introducing ""fresh"" new characters, playing bigger, going more obvious. Not only is Borat 2 stale, it's rotten. The idealogues will clap and nod along, and pretend that this is just as funny as ever. I thank God I am not one of those people. I don't have the energy to twist myself in knots defending this sub-SNL level piece of shieet.25/100",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

That being said, I just couldn't get the laughs from this film that I got from the original. I admit I found the actress playing the daughter super cute and both the main characters were talented, but the film relied so heavily on the same old jokes that I was barely able to muster a chuckle. For me, the primary laughs came from how ridiculous some of our political views sound when spoken out loud. I'd imagine too many people across the world they sound as ridiculous as they came across on screen.
Maybe I'm just older or too analytical not but I couldn't find the pranks as plausible as I did during the original.

I think one of the main reasons for the downfall of this movie is that there was no Azamat as he was turned into a coach.

The character of Borat is outrageous both with his jokes and the audacity of his public stunts.

It is an incredibly funny movie. I was laughing out loud for most of the film and sometimes had a hard time believing what I was hearing. The thing that makes this film that much funnier (or perhaps scarier?), is that these are real people that Borat is interacting with.
Certainly, a lot of jokes are very dark, and if you don't like that kind of humour then steer clear of this movie. However, if you don't mind that, Borat Subsequent Moviefilm is hilarious.The story part of the movie, however, felt a little out of place. It's good that there was an underlying motive for the character to do what he did. However, I did feel like a lot of the more serious and contemplative scenes didn't add much to the film. Indeed, they ended up disrupting what was an endless barrage of jokes and made the movie feel longer than it was.Borat Subsequent Moviefilm is a great comedy.

2) Doesn't take a single shot at the opposite side of the political spectrum. The current hyperprogressive hysteria has limitless potential for effective satire and would have actually been contrarian/edgy but Mr Cohen is actually more Bruno than Borat in real life.
3) The infamous Rudy Guiliani scene has some weird repetitive cuts from diffferent angles to make it seem like it's gone on for longer than it does.

191,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,"Get Crazy With Borat, Again",7,24 October 2020,"Stream to Big Screeners, we're in the middle of Halloween season, but we had to take some time to get some laughter. This week Prime Video released Borat Subsequent Moviefilm. This is the sequel to Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan. Honestly, I got tricked and hassled by Trip Fontaine into watching this film. I am not a big fan of Sacha Baron Cohen, but I can suffer through it to review for our viewers. Let's see how crazy this gets.Needless to say, Borat is completely crazy and it follows that his daughter is just as insane. This film is full of satirical, political commentary and, sadly, also just the reality of parts of America. The jokes are crisp and clever. It is sad that people actually fell for this while being recorded - again. I feel like some of these bits are entirely scripted, but I know that much of it is too close to real. Sasha Baron Cohen and Maria Bakalova really do capture the political insanity that has consumed America throughout 2020. For me, some of this is just a bit too much but what is satire without great exaggeration? It's bad comedy. Here, we have comedy that ultimately works and highlights the culture in which we live. The only thing I want to highlight is thank goodness for the Jeanise Jones's of the world. She's my favorite part of this movie. I must also shoutout the idiots trying to explain to Borat what a conspiracy theory is in this movie. This scene became way too close to showing the depressing division in this current political climate we are stuck in. Honestly, we have to thank Sacha for putting idiot ideology on front street. I'm looking at you Rudy Guiliani.Long story short, I suffered through this comedy but I'll admit I did laugh some. Borat does Borat things. If you enjoyed it before, then you'll enjoy this too. There isn't a rush to watch this but any undecided voters should definitely grab a bowl of popcorn and watch this before election day.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm
192,RetroRick,Occasionally funny but mostly grimmer than grimsby,5,24 October 2020,"The original Borat was almost certainly the funniest thing Sacha Baron Cohen did. This film retreads similar ground in way that is quite difficult to distinguish from the original but it just doesn't have the same vibe.Cohen is no different as Borat but the appendage of a clear political agenda to this film simply changes the character of the movie. Right wing Americans, Trump supporters, po-faced Christians etc just seem like not so much easy targets but incredibly predictable ones. The whole movie, framed around attempts to give Borat's daughter away as some kind of sex gift, first to Pence and then Giuliani makes this film a piece of not remotely subtle political propaganda. In fact I almost hesitate to use the term because the kind of propaganda we encounter these days tries to disguise it's purpose. Borat 2 at least has the decency not to do that. Sacha Baron clearly has very real political / ethical concerns about the illiberal nature of the Trump led Republican party & this film is simply about trying to damage the enemy.I can respect that I guess, but it makes it hard to take it as comedy in any kind of pure sense, which is something which really alters the movie, for however much Sacha Baron Cohen may remain the same very funny guy, he has lost his capacity to portray Borat as genuinely innocent.We experience this as a greater distance from the character, & the lack of something which was so important in the original film - the sense that at any moment Borat might do something truly shocking but innocent, so outrageous that it is cringeworthy. The problem here is though the shocking language & scatology come thick & fast they don't have the same power to make us titter.The second main reason this is so is one the film addresses fairly early on: we know & Borat knows that most people already know all about him, that he's famous & the possibility of milking comedy out of people caught completely off their guard has largely vanished. What this means in practice is that while we suspect that a lot of the film is basically scripted & performed by paid actors pretending to not know what is going on, where we suspect Borat might actually have caught someone unawares, we are still not sure it is a 'real' encounter. It really isn't Cohen's fault that that is the case. He & the film-makers do their best to work around this but ultimately it is a huge weight round the film, even where the script is sound & the jokes are fairly objectively funny.In fact the only clearly unscripted events in the film are the gate-crashing of a Republican party convention where Pence is the guest speaker - the look on Pence's face is priceless - a mixture of sadness & anger - & the interview with Rudy Giuliani. Rudy clearly does get suckered a little bit by Tutar, Borat's much abused daughter, become journalist. It doesn't look like anything would have happened but Giuliani is clearly charmed & flattered by the over-awed attention of the pretty young blonde woman with a confidence problem, who needs defending from her overbearing camerman (father). In fact it's rather disconcerting how successfully they play Giuiliani in this way.There are some other funny bits. The beginning is quite funny. The absurdity doubling down on the calumies against Khazakstan as a nation are quite funny as is the idea that Khazakstanis are offended by holocaust-deniers because they are proud of their role in causing the holocaust (I'm fairly sure this is completely unfair to Khazakstan but who knows).But the jokes by and large are few & far between & mostly what we get - far more than in the original - is a story about Borat's mission (to gift his daughter to Pence/Giuiliani) & the evolution of his relationship to his daughter.It's here that something quite odd happens. While Borat seems slightly lame & stale, the daughter Tutar is actually really good. She has a genuine feel for the piss-take aspect of the Borat format, & seems a complete natural in the role, playing the almost savage caged downtrodden female (Borat's Khazakstan seems to have doubled down on ""evil patriarchy"" since the last movie) with relish & really getting into the - probably best scene in the movie - the joint dance at the debutante scene. I said earlier that we were never quite sure whether the people getting sent up or outraged were real or actors - well I'm fairly sure the society figures & debutantes were real - the look of shock & disgust was almost certainly geniune & the same probably is true for the christian ladies who Tutar speaks out to later on.This aside the film dragged alot, & I never cared much about what happened. Sacha Baron Cohen is enormously talented, but he's not quite as sympathetic as he used to be. Overall I preferred his Grimsby with Mark Strong over this by far.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

I also am a BIG fan of Sacha Baron-Cohen, he is a wonderfully nice person and witty, not to say genius, comedian. This is why it is heart-breaking for me to tell you the stone cold truth: this Subsequent moviefilm is one of his worst works, it's even worse than The Dictator that held that title up to this point.Now, if you are a fan of Borat, like me, and you have Amazon streaming, there is nothing in the world that will stop you from watching this (especially it being free) so I think it will get the views, there is not need for all these fanbois 10/10 reviews on this site. This is not a spoiler review, however if you have seen the trailer you have seen everything that this movie has to offer (in fact the trailer have some shots that are not even in the movie itself!) there is no 'uncovering of Americas underbelly' and the worse thing, it's not even funny. Crazy to notice there are 10 names listed as writers list for this thing on top of Cohen himself. Really? maybe just let the comedian do his job? maybe?For some reason, the combination of 'candid camera' action and bad scripted non-candid camera just doesn't work this time. It comes out as a cringe-worthy 90 minutes of overly-gross juvenile humor. Where are all the edgy scenes that we are used to seeing from Baron-Cohen? Just watch Who Is America for some good edgy Baron-Cohen humor. Even better, watch some of the serious work Cohen does in ""The Spy"" or ""The Chicago 7"" those are masterpieces who deserve the 8+ ratings they get. This one? neh-eh.Overall, this should be on the bottom of the things you should see from Baron-Cohen if you watched everything else already- sure sit down and watch a mediocre 90 minutes that can be covered in 2 minutes of a trailer. Exact score: 45 / 100",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm
205,blackoutH,"I thought Sacha had lost his touch, I was wrong Borat returns not as scandalous but with the same level of boldness",8,28 October 2020,"The first time I saw the original Borat, I was too young to understand the comedic genius that this man actually is, having seen sometimes since then there's no question of how brilliant the Borat phenomenon is. Sacha is a fantastic actor and that associated with an incredible control not to go out of character and of course an insane dosage of courage, they dictate the quality of comedy of the movies and TV shows that Borat has appeared. The most important aspect of Borat in my opinion is not the outrageous lengths that the character goes for the laughs, but rather the intelligent and defenetely not subtle criticism of all that is wrong in our society.
For those not familiar, Sacha has had several comedic characters throughout his career, they are usually exaggerated caricatures of individuals, and they have the goal of showing that not only these are indeed ridiculous stereotypes but also at the same time exposing the discrimination, racism and hypocrisy of the people that interact with him.Sacha has been doing this for a long time, and since gaining worldwide recognition with the first Borat movie he has been kind of in the shadows, except with his TV show ""Who is America"" who should have had way more recognition than it should, exposing the rotten that infects the American regime and government.
And now he makes the comeback 14 years later with another approach for the infamous journalist from Kazakhstan - I am not going to lie,I was hesitant when I first heard about it, because the first movie and the previous TV appearances were so good and sometimes you shouldn't mess with what was already a brilliant piece of work, but turns out that he still got it!I think that overall you get a similar approach and formula with some fresh perspective, this time Borat has his daughter with him ready to make you uncomfortable again with the typical blunt and outrageous ideas that we are now used to at this point. I believe that the movie might not be as scandalous as the previous movie or even at the level of the ""Who is America"" TV show, for which to this day I am still shocked, but maybe that feeling might be because I've seen how far he went on other occasions, so we still get some very sad and socking attitudes coming from America, and although this is a comedy you should look at it with a critical eye as well, this is the best ""it's funny because it's true"" type of scenario that you can get.

Would we sit comfortably with say an Iraqi comedian making fun of the Shtetl or God forbid The State of IsraelThere would probably be many suits very quickly; Anti-Defamation League etc etcBut that way round he is seemingly unconcerned about his ""choice""; as is almost everybody else in the West
Since we know little about this huge country ... we let it pass====OK that out of the way let us talk about Borat 2====Is it as funny as Borat 2006? NoIs is still better than most comedy outthere? Resoundingly yesHere there is more of a storyline than in 2006. You have to admire him pulling this off during Covid ... there must have been many practical impediments. The Bulgarian actress who plays his daughter is a perfect foil; in fact she is so good at what she did here that at times you pay more attention to her than to BoratSo excellent casting
As always in the Cohen's oeuvre you can watch this as a sniggering 14-year old or as an adult and yes you are allowed to switch back and forth as you watchNot much else to say really. The trailer promised more than the film delivered; so kudos and bit of a shameThe best thing that has happened in my town in 2020 is the erection for a weekend of a Golden Statue of Alan Partridge outside the main library; this is Borat 2 is the second best comedic event of the year thus far ....Thank you Mr Cohen; keep trucking' maybe some new characters .... must not flog a moribund horse ; although Borat probably would",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

I knew what to expect and not to expect. Still I was shocked at just how absolutely awful this film is. I wanted to like it. But I cant give credit where its not due. In my opinion he could of done much better. Could of been such a funny film in a critical time. When the world needs laughter. Not more disappointment! I mean there's so many people that dont get paid. That could of made this opportunity. Way more enjoyable. That's sad considering were discussing veteran writers, comedians, actors and more. But lacks the passion of your average youtube sketch. It didn't seem like his heart or mind was in this project. Maybe it was , who knows..... But personally I wouldn't recommend the 2nd Borat to anyone. The first had a large niche group. This movie was all over the place though. Most of the jokes. Are relying on shock value. Borat is well known now too. So he couldn't as easily interact with the public like before. Why he chose to put on the worst disguise and personality to evade that is beyond me. Wasn't funny , just annoyingly stupid. A 15minute group discussion could of came up with a million better ideas. Then the girl...... Ugh.... Another parlor trick that worked out horribly. Now he has to make a 3rd one to return any of Borat's integrity. Sigh..... I know this guy is smart too. I just dont get it..... Like zero pride in this film.

213,andrewburgereviews,With great success comes great responsibility,7,4 February 2021,"Aah, how times have changed. Nearly 15 years ago, Sacha Baron Cohen's Khazakh mysogynistic journalist Borat Sagdiyev was raving across the United States roasting every single person and ethnic group he could find. Perhaps he thought a movie like that would not spin in today's world--but if he really wanted it, he definitely could've done it.The reason is different.With 2020's significant historical events both natural and political, a character like Borat--who taunts politics and political correctness alike at every turn--hits close to home. So, there is a responsibility for Cohen to shift his character towards more just causes--from ""wear mask save live"" to realizing that women should actually not live in cages but be equal--shocking!--Borat is a changed man and only for the better even if that mean tossing aside that crude but effective humor that made him a household name.Borat starts hid misadventure in his home country of Khazakstan--where they speak Bulgarian, Romanian and Hebrew, go figure--and is on a mission to make amends with the US by delivering to those rich, white men the thing they desire the most--a young girl, possibly underage. This is where his daughter, Tutar, comes in. She is simply put feminine Borat--except she lives in a cage which she considers normality. Bulgarian Maria Bakalova, though, is a revelation. Her upstart performance rivals that of Cohen in both bluntness and brutishness. She was, in fact, so self-degrading that at times I felt bad for such a talented actress but that only goes to show what a fine job she was doing.But, of course, generational issues are not first-world countries specific, so soon enough both her and Borat learn valuable lessons about basic human rights. This is where the movie changes and does something that we would've never expected from a raunchy-comedy artist like Cohen--it tosses the humor aside. The fact that such basic civilized behavior and principles needed to be reminded makes this a sad year. Still, the fact that they come from someone like Borat Sagdiyev makes it even more ironic but also hopeful. It had to be done by him, the opportunity was obvious and the impact has huge potential.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

230,theshanecarr,Making fun in America,7,1 June 2021,"I love Borat in small doses. Used for a sketch Sacha Baron Cohen's caricature of regressive ideas could be hilarious, but I found the first feature film to be too much.A somewhat repetitive, but often hilarious, dive into the darker parts of the American psyche, it fell apart for me in the scripted parts which were ostensibly about Borat the character travelling across America to meet Pamela Anderson. When Baron Cohen gets in front of real life people, his ability to brazenly walk them into incriminating themselves is second to none but when devising the glue to hold those disparate scenes together, the film struggled mightily.So it came as a real surprise to me to find that the scripted scenes in ""Subsequent Moviefilm"" are among its most memorable material. It turns out necessity really is the mother of invention and the fact that Borat has become too well known forced Baron Cohen and crew into a new formulation that worked fantastically; the introduction of his daughter, Tutar, as played by Maria Bakalova.This does two things; it gives Baron Cohen a sparring partner who seems every bit his equal in terms of commitment to the bit and madcap energy, and it gives them both a chance to play an actual character arc as they re-evaluate the role of women in the world.The final portion of the movie forms jumps back to scripted action, and it stumbled a bit here for me, but there was enough surprise to keep me smiling.The interactions with real Americans are a mixed bag. Some are horrifying (the doctor recommending surgery to an underage Tutar), some are sweet (the older ladies at the synagogue (who kindly correct Borat on his holocaust denial), and some leave one unsure what to think (the men Borat quarantines with who genuinely believe some outrageous conspiracy theories but who also seem like nice guys who have been misled), but these all add up to a nice snapshot of America in 2020. Something I hope I can look back on many, many years from now and marvel at how much things have improved. (Fingers crossed!)That Baron Cohen had this out in the same year as he delivered a wonderful performance in ""The Trial of the Chicago Seven"" is impressive. That he brought this out in time for the then upcoming American election is brilliant.Dziekuje.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

232,don2507,"""Should I Go Have a Sexy Time?""",8,27 January 2021,"Borat 2020 is funny in many places, and trenchant in its satire, but frankly not as funny as Borat 2006 which was hilarious. Part of the problem is that Borat is such a recognizable character to many folks that we can't be sure how much of his interaction with others is unscripted. In addition, a few scenes, even for a viewer like me who doesn't like to put limits on humor, tested those limits with borderline bad taste, e.g., COVID-19, which has killed over 400,000 Americans, was initiated by ""gypsy tears""and spread by Borat. Nonetheless, there's brilliant comic moments in this film, and much sarcasm: the QAnon conspiracists are referred to as ""scientists."" If Borat seems likely to be retired, I will miss him very much.I must note that the reviews on this site depict many Republican-oriented viewers very much offended by Borat's satirical targets in Borat 2020, but who claim they enjoyed the more ""apolitical"" Borat 2006. They must have short memories; Borat's always found more, and easier, targets on the Right. Let's look at Borat 2006's satirical targets in order: feminism / misogyny, a gay pride parade, interacting with two right-wing Republican politicians, ""supporting"" the ""Republican"" Iraq war at the rodeo, anti-semitism, etiquette, Confederate ""heritage items,"" and a Pentecostal camp meeting complete with a Republican congressman. Now here are the main satirical targets in Borat 2020 in order: the goal is to give a girl to ""Vice Premiere"" Pence (whose religious sensibilities will not allow him to be alone with another woman), a debutante ball, a CPAC meeting, giving the same girl to Rudy Giuliani (who looks charmed by her but reportedly wanted to sue the producers for the ""set-up""), misogyny / sexism, Holocaust denial / anti-semitism, QAnon conspiracies, a ""liberation"" rally from COVID restrictions, and the destruction of a Dr. Fauci mascot by a needle administered by Trumpists. Get the point.....there's much overlap in the targets of Borat 2006 and 2020. If you're complaining about the ""politicization"" of Borat 2020, you forget much of Borat 2006, and your Republican sensitivities were presumably amplified by the nearness of the 2020 election.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

235,MackMonMay87,It's Always Harder When the Joke's on You,7,13 November 2020,"Some reviews mention that the latest Borat isn't as funny or doesn't hit the mark in the same way as the original. My guess would have to be that due to the political climate becoming more divided and angry than ever before, people don't find Borat and his roasting of American stupidity quite as funny anymore. Especially since so much of that particular brand of stupidity has become so mainstream and widely accepted.The original Borat, and this movie, both serve to satirize American culture and political events, and anyone who couldn't see that from the first movie either wasn't aware of that at the time or looking at the film from the present day with rose-colored nostalgia glasses on. Maybe they forgot how skewering the original was, because the sequel keeps the same uncomfortable, irreverent spirit, updating the material with deeply disturbing, cringe-worthy, yet hilarious pranks and scenes that expose many of the absolute morons and casual bigots who permit all kinds of offensive remarks in their presence.Sacha Baron Cohen uses a number of hilarious disguises and variations of his now infamous Borat character, and the gags shown are outstanding. His daughter, Tutar, played by actress Maria Bakalova is the new star here that truly shines as his accomplice. Having her being able to work with Borat opens up a whole new set of deeply uncomfortable gags that will have you rolling with laughter and groans at the same time.The message of this sequel and the people exposed in it are exactly what our country needed at this time.

It centers around Borat trying to get his daughter pretty to be able to marry someone. and that's basically the whole story. the reason I think this is a movie more than a documentary is because it focuses around Love and family, and how Borat finds true love for his daughter rather than needing to. there were a few funny things from this movie but there's no way that it could be funnier than the first one. If it were, there would actually be execution's towards them. the first film was way more racist and sexist. while this movie focused on being pretty much just sexist material because race is a harder thing nowadays.

At very least, I expected Baron Cohen to try pull 'something' (anything?) out of the bag, and make me laugh, despite myself......Sadly, not here.I'm fully aware, that Baron Cohen (and 'Borat' specifically) are quite well known to western audiences, so there's little anonymity to his 'schtick' this time around....but this movie still carried on as if it was all secretly filmed, on-the-hoof film-making (when it clearly wasn't)Everything here was staged (right down to briefest viginette) and all the (paid) actors and/or onlookers needn't have had to worry about 'corpsing' on camera....because the material here was (worryingly) dire. If this is the best they can do 'scripted', then perhaps Baron Cohen needs to look elsewhere in future?Nothing (at all) rang true (not even the so-called 'shocked-reactions') This was a stale, lazy and predictable 'hit-piece' and (apart from chuckling slightly at the 'period-gag') the only 'funny' thing about it was the 'agenda' behind it.Amazon have put this out just before the election (and it shows) The finished product, could have (conceivably) been written, rehearsed, performed, filmed and edited over a wet weekend (it's simply *that* lacking and allround 'meh')Whereas Baron Cohen once used his 'stereotypical' (albeit, incestuous, fish-out-of-water) foreigner, to (cleverly) prank his prey into revealing their own (real) cultural prejudices/eccentricities....he instead targets the individual (Trump) .....and to a lazier extent, Conservatives and Christianity (primarily, because it's a lot safer than mocking the polar opposite, I guess?)
There was a minefield of material Baron Cohen could/should have used, had he kept it on a level-playing field. Which is a crying shame, because I could envision the (publicity-thirsty) Democrats actually being a lot more susceptible to pranks of this nature....but of course, actual comedy and entertainment take a backseat here, over political bias (and the public are sick to death of celebrity opinions as it is.....even moreso, when it's supposed to be a comedy)The (oh-so) 'controversial' Rudy Guiliaini sequence was about as forced and staged as everything else beforehand. Employing doubles, inserts and dubbing to pad out the flimsiest of scenes of the former Mayor lying down on a bed to remove his microphone pack.
I hope Guiliaini sues both Amazon and Baron Cohen....which would produce the one genuine laugh from this deeply, unfunny mess (Rounded off by sickening self-advertising from Amazon and a smug Tom Hanks cameo) that'll likely help cement Donald Trump another four years in office.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm
244,picturetaker,Loved the first one. This one wasn't even close to the original.,1,11 November 2020,"I absolutely loved the original Borat. Must've saw it a hundred times in the 00's and quoted it with friends. It was funny and it was real satire. Where as this new Borat? Seems totally fake.How so? The most real scene is when he is instantly recognized by everyone on the street. That just shows how doomed this movie was from the beginning. From the Red Neck scene that plays out by what I can only assume were actors. To how few people Borat is able to interact with throughout this movie. Seriously is not even remotely close to the original! If there were a deleted scenes to this movie, I can only imagine how many times he was found out.The worst part of this movie wasn't the fact it actually felt fake though. It was how anti Republican it was. It was the main theme of this entire movie and was brutally obvious. While the original Borat did mix some anti George Bush politics into it, it was mostly a satire and about punking honest Americans with a strange foreign man and his accent. This? It wreaks of particionship! It was way too much and obvious. From the Mike Pence rally where he shows up as a clansman to the tricking of Rudy Giuliani into an interview and then Borats ""daughter"" untucks his shirt and they manipulate it to look like he is doing something wrong with a ""15 year old girl"" who is actually 24! To quote Joe Biden ""Common man!"" It was relentless and made the movie boring. Simply put there was way too much political nonsense added to this movie.So if you enjoy watching Democrat Propaganda disguised as comedy? This movie is for you. If you don't because either you're a Republican OR you don't care whatsoever about USA politics. This movie is extremely boring with a few chuckles here and there but ultimately not very good. Skip it and watch the original. Its still funny.I give this a 1 star simply because this won't age well and the rewatchability is non-existent. Unlike the original.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm
245,burnzyburns,A (slightly) different approach,7,26 October 2020,"When Borat came out many moons ago i highly considered to be one of my all time favourite comedies especially that of the crude nature. A movie like that I could never picture it having a sequel but in 2020 where this year and it's few previous that have been decimated by sequels, I wasn't too surprised to see this being made and realeased.Borat ""2"" still sticks with the same formula of being off the wall, no limits style comedy. Unlike the first movie that doesn't follow much of a script or story and instead throws us into these completely ridiculous scenarios that amount to absolutely nothing other then poking fun at old country USA, Borat 2 actually has a plot. It involves Borat having to succeed his mission to lend a monkey named Johnny to Trump to make Borats country redeem itself. Of course, things don't go to plan.Borat 2 surrounds itself around Trump and COVID. How fitting and a win win for a crude comedy, right? Sort of. Instead of the original sidekick Azamat, we have Borat's daughter. I must admit, I really liked her. She's brave in her role and she's very funny at times and rarely annoying. I wasn't at any point truly skeptical. Borat, himself, has his moments. You'll pick and choose your favourite scenes from him and I mean he's really funny at times but at other times a bit dry with his humour and forced. Naturally I thought he would be hilarious but his daughter seems to make him look good when they're in scenes together. It was surprising.The ending isn't a grand conclusion of any kind but it reflects on Borats time in America, including scenes from his first appearance. It was a decent ending.You'll laugh and enjoy yourself.

248,Q-Man,"Some very funny moments, but mostly not",6,14 November 2020,"I would have to say that, overall, Subsequent Moviefilm was a bit disappointing. It had some very funny moments, but most of the time it was not all that funny. I had trouble believing that the people being filmed weren't aware of what was happening. Why would these people allow cameras into their businesses? Would two Q-anon followers actually invite a stranger (and presumably a cameraman) to stay with them? What about the Reverend at the pregnancy clinic? Wouldn't he question the cameras? Other people, too, behaved too normally, without questioning anything. I have read that Jeanine Jones, the babysitter, thought she was in a documentary, so her part was not as unbelievable as the others. She came off as a very caring and sweet woman.
The movie was at it's best when skewering the Trump Administration and associates. That was where it got funny, and right on the mark. Giuliani was laughable in several ways. We have all heard of the ""shirt tucking"" scene, but his assertions on Trump's handling of COVID were absurd. Rudy has become a walking punchline, both with this movie and his press conference at the Four Seasons Complete Landscaping ( between the crematorium and the porn store).

The young actress who plays her has SBC's fearlessness, comic instincts and gift for improv. She's terrific. How she got through the debutante ball dance scene is beyond me. They just make a great pair and have wonderful chemistry as actors and partners in crime.It's more overtly topical than the first one, which I for one like. I'm a news and political junky so I like being able to laugh my head off over issues that usually give me a headache and angst.....sexism, authoritarianism, Qanon, etc. There is outrageous humor and gross-out moments and glorious punking, but there is also something of a storyline and even a character arc, which makes the movie more satisfying.The bit players who are unwittingly roped into the story all add to the fun and lessons learned, especially the babysitter he hires for his daughter, an unflappable shipping store employee and two women he meets at a synagogue while wearing an insane ""Jewish Disguise"" apparently based on Medieval caricatures. One of the women, a Holocaust survivor, died not long ago and he dedicates the movie to her.Borat 2 might not be as iconic as its predecessor or make as much money, but it's still SBC in top form and I'm grateful for it.

In theory it's interesting that you catch a politician in an awkward position and instead of just releasing a the clip, you make a whole film around it. But in practice, the whole film is a chore, full of cringe and not funny moments. Sacha is clearly just a leftist who is triggered by Trump, and while this isn't a problem in itself, it's quite clear he can't express this in a very creative way, probably the worse thing he has made to date. It also seems to me that unlike the original Borat, a much higher proportion of people in the film are actors, and this kills a lot of the humor.

The film really does feel like its trying to be 2 things, one moment he is with a Priest saying that he put a baby into his daughter, which felt like classic Borat, then on the next clip the film is back to being about politics which didn't make me laugh, there was clips & segments that very classic Borat but for the most part i did not laugh anywhere as much as i did in the first film, first film Borat went around exploring the US, meeting different people & cultures, this new film totally a different vibe.Most of the film is about his daughter that he plans to give away as a gift to the leaders, again its for politics, if it was for a different reason then it could have been executed much better.I really think that he should of done a new film before the Covid pandemic & the re election or waited until the Covid is over so he can fully be in the Borat role which we loved, by all means if he wants to make a film about the election & politics then make another film, don't label it with the Borat format behave a lot of us didn't really enjoy it, my friends & family have even said its mot that great as the first.Age - 26Cinema: Amazon Prime MoviesWatch, Avoid, Consider: Do watch for small bits of laugh but you will wish it was different.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

Borat
The Dictator
What We Do in the ShadowsThis review will feature minor spoiler; but only to portray how outrageous this film actually is.
This is the latest 2020 film from the comedian Sacha Baron Cohen. If you're familiar with ""The Dictator"" you know what to expect. It's a follow-up film to a 2006 ""Borat"", centering on the real-life adventures of a fictional Kazakh television journalist named Borat.
The plot of this film centers around Borat's attempt to blend in with the American public, during the Coronavirus pandemic, and just before the US elections; after he believes he became popular with the first film back in 2006 (btw, this is one of the first major film about the current pandemic). The film's objective isn't high-quality intelligent jokes, and it isn't really the stupid American-comedy fart jokes either. Sasha Baron Cohen makes ultra-realistic, unimaginably inappropriate satire; he and his crew travel around America pretending that they are filming an actual documentary, exposing the most misguided, or utterly repugnant, corners of American culture. It is funny right until it's scary. When you watch this, you think that there's absolutely no way that the film isn't staged, and that the people around Borat actually believe in the circus he pulls up. There is a way. Sasha is very convincing.
Some examples:
Sacha Baron Cohen sat nearly five hours in a toilet stall at the 2020 CPAC (Conservative Political Action Conference) until US Vice President Mike Pence was about to appear on stage. This is a REAL Vice President of the United States, and his REAL audience that he appears before in his Donald Trump disguise. Unbelievable.
Sacha spent five whole days with pro-conservatives Jerry Holleman and Jim Russell without breaking character as Borat. Those two Trump-supporter guys seem more fictional than Borat himself, and all the stuff they say isn't a script, they actually do believe it. Unbelievable.
The interview with Rudy Giuliani, ex-mayor of New-York and Trump's personal lawyer is absolutely real. With respect to his extremely inappropriate scene with Borat's daughter, his defense was by stating on Twitter that he was ""tucking in his shirt after taking off recording equipment."" Hmmmm.. Un-believable.
The only person that knew the whole thing was a joke was Judith Dim Evans; a Holocaust survivor seen at the synagogue scene; Cohan told her right after the scene was finished. She died shortly after filming, and the movie is dedicated to her.
This film makes you think how much we (at least in some countries) have achieved with the freedom of speech and human rights in general. Despite being outrageously inappropriate the whole way through, the film is actually surprisingly kind and sweet.
A pre-election call to get the American public to vote, and a very unusual, unparalleled comedy that deserves it's own genre.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

Sacha hasn't lost it and the lass playing his daughter (stunner btw) really fits into the character and seems to be able to ad-lib to further the hilarity whenever necessary.A LOT of people are gonna be annoyed by this film, but I'm English and I don't really have a political bias when it comes to America (or at all tbh) but if you're a Republican who CAN'T take a joke (or a snowflake as I think, the internet calls them), I really wouldn't watch.There were many other reasons to get offended (many of which, if I didn't enjoy taking the mick and having the same done to me and my views, religion or whatever it may be, I should not been offended by. But MAN UP, it's a film!!!) That I wont go into as I don't know how much has been released on trailers and talk shows.There's 1 major gross put moment which I'm sure a certain type of people might find liberating, (when you watch you'll understand the exact moment) that I found hilarious at the same time as disgusting, perfect combination...Just keep in mind this is Sacha Baron Cohen and this is what he does.

It constantly made me think which scenes were real and which ones were staged? I honestly believe most of the scenes were scripted this time. I think the people involved weren't actors, but most of the scenes must have been scripted. I mean you could basically just see it by the bad acting! Except probably for the public scenes during the 'anti-covid' rally, the CPAC conference and the interview with Guiliani. But this just made the story a bit weaker in my opinion.

I would howl with laughter and I was really looking forward to this- I just got back from London last night due to work and was bummed I didn't have time to watch it right when it came out. I had planned to watch it with my fiancee in London because I was excited to see her reaction, she is a equity partner in a law firm there and oddly enough is probably the funniest person I know. She'd had never seen Borat but knew a bit about Ali G and as a London born and bred lady she likes Ali G. Anyhow that never happened it would have been good to get her opinion.It made me feel old because as much as I loved Sacha when I was a young teen I watched this expected to howl with laughter but it all felt so tired and old. sort of like Abbott ad Castello but a bit too try hard. I don't want to get in to revealing detail but ultimately it is the same predictable stuff we laugh at when we are 13, 14, 15 because it seemed edgy or grown up or something back then now it is just kind of like a episode of the Jackass movies with a script. Same kind of goofy humor.Anyhow, didn't see to be fun or different or edgy just seemed a bit lazy because they know stoners and teens will often laugh at fart jokes. So now I feel almost like a grown up and soon I'll be telling kids to get out of my yard. I know Cohen can do better he is brilliant and this seems repetitive. I bet it does big numbers though! So I can't be one of those people who say it wasn't funny because I don't get to decide what is funny or not. To me it wasn't funny and mostly because it is so much like the first one same cringe moment stuff.Anyhow, I hope you enjoy it and aren't like me, where you watch it and it just reminded you of more simple times when a fart jokes would make you laugh. Growing up and becoming an adult has those moments - when you realize you can't go back. Come on Mr Cohen grow with us and do some stuff that is smart like we know you can do.

The premise alters from the first trip because he's daughter Tutar, with the amazing acting of Maria Bakalova, will change the trolling game in Yankee soil. Sacha Baron Cohen used well the new word social, political and health order, and the context of the pandemics and the American elections to continue the plot based in trolling and make innocent fun of random Americans, all in the name of the most original comedy. A modus operandi that blasts the world with ""great success"" with the first Borat movie.Now, the major difference is that the great nation of Kazakhstan doesn't need America's knowledge, only need Borat to give U.

A gift which was very well selected to bring an outstanding plot twist, with a very actual connection.The only negative point to me was the excessive use of sexual themes and references, even when is to comedy purposes.Overall, this film and subsequent comedy icon of the 21st century deserves a good 9 out of 10 points.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

That single set of six episodes was brilliant.However, continuations of the themes from this ""one trick"" show proved increasingly cringe-worthy. This includes the two-season U.S. version of the Ali G show/ various ""made for video"" films such as Ali G in the USAiii, as well as films like Borat and Brüno (all based on characters from the Ali G Show).Meanwhile Cohen's other roles in Hugo and Sweeney Todd did not convince. When stepping out of the role of luring people into a trap in order to open up about their actual thoughts ""The Dictator"" was enjoyable, yet forgettable.So, two decades after I saw truly inspiring Cohen ""content"", the Mrs. and I sat down, having watched two fairly terrible TV-show episodes (unrelated).

Very politically colored, biased to the far left. And this with Giuliani is the only thing that raised dust in this miserable piece of trash. But actually it is nothing interesting. It's all about Giuliani really adjusting his pants and microphones (the actress was helping him) and that was nothing indecent or shocking.

311,BlizzyFoxTF,"Time capsule of 2020 America, filled with jawdropping segments and seamless political commentary insertions, capped with an incredible ending",7,23 October 2020,"Who knew there is still so much gas left in Sacha Baron Cohen's tank 14 years into the future? And as Borat, no less.I have been a big fan of SBC's work for many years. Borat is a one of a kind classic. Ali G and Bruno are also testaments to not only his comedic genius, but his keen eye on social satire. I am not the biggest fan of ""Who is America?"". I think the series is inconsistent and relies too much on crude humor. No one expected SBC to pull his beloved old character from the dead in what I consider to be his most adventurous project yet, and yet he did.While some of those vulgar sex jokes from ""Who is America?"" still carry over to this film, it is its most salient flaw. This ""sequel"" took the retired character of Borat into the limelight and improved upon its predecessor not only in terms of its narrative flow, but also its characters and plot. The quality of the pranks get better as the film plays out, and what the film delivers in emotional beats, political commentary and entertainment value as it resolves is way beyond my original expectations. It feels like both an update on the American social and political climate and a love letter/beautiful resolution to the themes and ideas presented in the first Borat film. It justifies its existence in triumphant style. Given the circumstances surrounding the production, with the COVID-19 virus still prevalent throughout the film's production, this film is a rare gem that almost feels impossible to concoct given its sheer ambition and big risks. Not sure if I can credit it to a perfect storm of coincidences or just SBC's experience and genius.This film is an essential watch. I can understand how it may be unsuitable for certain audiences, especially parties that the film blatantly targets against and audiences who are turned away by Baron's typical hard R content. However, for those who ""gets it"" and appreciate what SBC has contributed to humanity over the last two decades, this is a fresh classic, almost a throwback to the old days of the Ali G show and Borat. For this, I and many others are elated. Ladies and folks, another Borat film to savour! What a memorable one at that!",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

Even though i wasn't sure anyone could match his spirit of character play which he takes it to extreme ways (which he did in this movie) she could do that too. In the recent interview sacha talked about choosing her from 500 candidates and she was given the script in UK and she has never been to US before yet did a mind-blowing job in the movie with her flawless acting and sacha was actually overshadowed by her performance which is crazy.

I enjoyed the first Borat film, but this one just feels too unrealistic to me. It's possible the bits were all with people who had no idea this was Sacha Baron Cohen, but i sincerely doubt it. The dialogue and things people say seem much more rehearsed than bits on Da Ali G Show.Sure, the social commentary is interesting, and I like that Cohen still doesn't shy away from any topic.

14 years after the events of the first film Borat is sent back to the United States, but this time with a different purpose and alongside his daughter.
We waited 14 years for a sequel to the first feature, and was it worth it?
the answer is yes! It was very worth it
Borat 2020 presents the same kind of humor as the first film which is great, again a very good performance by Sacha Baron Cohen and most importantly: extremely heavy criticisms of the American lifestyle and the Trump administration, which is undoubtedly the point highest in the film.
Perhaps anyone who is not fully familiar with current US policy will not understand one or the other joke, but you can have fun just the same.
At certain moments in the film you will find yourself asking: What is this? How hasn't Sacha Baron Cohen been arrested yet ??
And this is just amazing.
But obviously not everything in the film is wonderful, it presents some problems of the first film, as things are resolved very easily and happen very fast, for me the first Borat (2007) is still better, but the second feature manages to honor the first well.
Borad (2020) is a great film, even though it is not perfect and a little inferior than the first, it is a great sequel and a very funny comedy film, with heavy criticisms and pertinent to the USA",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

I was jealous of the Bulgarian girl and did not want her in the movie at first.. but they blended in so well..i watched it in 1 go.. i did not stop it start doing something else and return back to it etc like i normally do..Borat 1 is stronger..

If you had encountered such a person in real life, you'd wholeheartedly want to help him. And that's where the original's hijinks started.Subtle character differences in this one, though. The seemingly sweet veneer was gone at times. Rather than having some more or less harmless fun with the unknowing participants, he struck a harsher mocking tone.

So who the movie is aimed at is quite the mystery.The critics reviews are also perplexing as reading their reviews they talk about an average movie at best which gets good in the last half hour if you stick with it but its not as good as the first and yet they are still awarding it 4 or 4.5 star out of 5Its clear there is an agenda in the movie but it seems utterly lost in a what is a confusing movie. It shows a lot of shops selling things to Borat and his daughter and ignoring anything they say to make the sale, is that a dig at capitalism or just the greed of humanity?It shows a woman showing genuine concern for Borat's daughter and her proposed plastic surgery and her lack of understanding of her body.It shows the Russel family take in a foreigner during a national epidemic and tolerate his cultural differences, it also tries to highlight their 'southern prejudices' as they talk about Democrats drinking blood.It then shows Borat in disguise singing a song about injecting the virus and the crowd are singing along then the Russel family help to reunite Borat and his daughter.I wanted to turn the movie off after the first twenty minutes but having read the reviews I stuck with it to see the good last half hour but even then its just a slog.Honestly, the only shocking thing about this movie is the high reviews its been getting.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

Hence a lot of the so called 'real people' feel like actors or people who are just going along with the joke. Yes it certainly not the fault of Cohen that his film was so successful he can no longer get away with it, but perhaps it's a shortfall in thinking that it was worth going for a second shot. It just felt a little desperate and also rushed, too focussed on what they thought was a gigantic satirical opportunity, that being 2020, the year from hell.

Are you laughing with him, are you laughing at him, are you even laughing? I've been watching him since Ali-G first entered the house, and I've always felt uneasy whenever he is on-screen... You see, I'm not big on schadenfreude, I don't enjoy watching people being put on-the-spot, being made fun-of, squirming in their seats... In general it makes me feel sorry for them, and I feel a bit uneasy.
That being said, SBC takes the risks no one else seems to be willing to, and exposes the truths through satire that most people would prefer stayed hidden.
Is Borat 2, as I will call it for brevity's sake, better than Borat? In short no. It is a little less ""laugh-out-loud"" funny, it is also a little less vulgar (not saying that's a good thing), and a little less real feeling (probably a result of the first movie's success and SBC being way more recognized than before.)
However the addition of the lovely and talented Maria Bakalova (playing Borat's daughter, Tutar Sagdiyev), and the additional humanity, interactions, story-lines and character arcs that she brought with her performance helped to make up for all that.

363,benniegrezlik,Borat as a Mad Magazine movie,3,15 November 2020,"Borat would have been a perfect vehicle for Mad Magazine. I am a pretty old dude, so I remember with fondness Mad Magazine in the fifties satirizing such tropes as Superman, Batman, and numerous television shows. Realy, any form of entertainment that appealed to ""the masses"" was fair game because secretly, us kids knew mass media was BS.To a preteen in the fifties, Mad Magazine was the epitome of sophisticated satire. Borat would have been hilarious. But, I am well beyond my preteens and America is well beyond the fifties. The in-your-face humor of Borat is in the same genre as fart jokes and pulling a chair out from under someone who is about to sit down. The boys in the middle school cafeteria would laugh at this, but most of us have moved on.I agree with the politics of Borat, but not the methods of Republican exposure to ridicule. Really, one could pull these same ""jokes"" on any political group to make them look stupid. The said ""jokes"" are just embarrassing to any adult.Watch this if you want to remember the humor of your childhood, and to do that once in a while is okay.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

If I had to guess, it's partly because of the (ironically probably more thought through) script making it seem less genuine, relying too much on pure shock (ala Bruno), or simply being victim of measuring up to the past success of Borat.I think Sacha Baron Cohen's recent Who Is America is honestly a much better watch if you're interested in contemporary American politics and society. Borat: Subsquent Moviefilm simply doesn't manage to show us much that's worth remembering a week, a month, or a year from now (despite being linked to the election).

386,ryan-beauchesne,The Needed Evolution of Borat.. but with an Unfortunate (but Understandable) Lacking of Borat as Himself,8,24 October 2020,"This was the needed evolution of Borat in the sense that it was much more story-focused with many scenes purely for plot over laughs, and a moral to the ending. Especially with a strong supporting actress (Totar was actually the star I believe), it was expectantly a slightly different feel and resultantly also less hilarious overall than the original, but still very funny and very enjoyable. I am glad they did it this way, though, for if they just made a shallow, meandering series of gags like the first film, it would have felt repetitive and lacking anything new. So, I think they did the right thing.The reason I give it 8 stars is that there is just something lost in not being able to see Borat in his original character form. Of course it is understandable and nothing can be done about it, but part of what makes Borat so funny is his facial expressions and goofy looks. This is sorely lost with all the disguises and costumes, and at moments you could even confuse yourself wondering if this is the new Borat movie or just another 'Who is America?' series..As usual, silliness and jokes aside, Borat works to expose the ignorance of people's belief systems, and especially that of far right-wing conservatives and Trumpism, tackling such critical current issues as the rise of conspiracy theories into mainstream populism, misinformation, misogyny, and more. The negative reviews here are clearly the Trumpists griping about being called out through this film. One reviewer even complained Borat should have been more 'fair' by equally attacking left-wing figures. Well, perhaps there's some truth in that there was a missed opportunity or two to poke a little fun at the Left, but let's be clear, Trumpism and the far-right is so far gone in the embodiment of moral corruption and anti-intellectualism, it deserves all the criticism and ridicule it gets.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

389,juujuuuujj,"As a Bulgarian, watching this was an absolute blast.",10,29 October 2020,"First of all, this movie is such a pleasure to watch, all audiences with a robust sense of humor will enjoy it, and hordes of easily offended viewers will fume with outrage. But since half the dialogue was in Bulgarian, I thought I might shed some light on just how great and funny Maria Bakalova's performance was in this film. First, let start off with how difficult this was to film. There are many wild and provocative scenes, Rudy Giuliani's ""bed scene"" chief among them, that were an absolute feat to pull off. Everything was wrapped in a funny, surreal story about Premier Nazarbaev using Borat as a spy on American soil, and Borat reconnecting with his feral daughter whom he uses as a honey trap against US politicians.Hiding cameras in plain sight and nudging people to reach the limits of their own insanity is what Sacha Baron Cohen does best, and is a testament to his brilliance. He challenges conservative prudishness by flashing a mirror in front of it, and the result in outrageous, provocative and awakening.Going back to Maria Bakalova, she was the best support Sacha could have asked for in this movie. Her transformation from a crude feral child to a Westernized and emancipated woman was as absurd as it was genuinely moving. Every single phase by her was likely a riff, or half-improv, but it added so much comedic value to the story. It surely sounded like gibberish to the broader audience, especially when mixed with Sacha Baron Cohen's ""Kazakhstani"". ""You're a woman? Show me your p****!"", she demands of a bewildered caretaker who educates her about womanhood and self-respect. ""Daddy! I swallowed the baby"", she says with childish panic before going to a clinic and pushing the nuances of planned Parenthood. This film creates unlikely protagonists and has several layers of thoughtfulness beneath the crude jokes and provocation. Comedic gems spoken in Bulgarian will remain hidden like Easter eggs throughout the movie, and I hope even fans of this film will re-watch it with curiosity to find them.
Finally, and most importantly, Borat 2 is not offensive to Kazakhstanis, who took the joke and used it as a clever tourism ad for their beautiful and spectacular country.As an Eastern-European, I am not offended either. I hope Westerners will be just as robust in their humor and self-mockery.
Enjoy this film for what it is, and for the crazy time when was filmed. If you are still hesitating about seeing it, trust me, ""pochti niama da sajaliavate :)""...",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm
390,marulez,"Not family friendly at all, avoid it",1,6 June 2021,"It has some very funny moments here and there but over all it is very grotesque and definitely not something to watch with your family. I like the jokes where he plays dumb but then there are the sexual jokes which are simply out of place and unnecessary. The ""fertility dance"" was the most appalling thing I've ever seen in a movie. Then there's also too much politics in the movies which is also not a good thing as when you mix politics with comedy, obviousely you are going to distance a segment of the population and my logical question is, why do comedy only for 50% of Americans and customers?",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm
391,robertopoletti,Still a very good film. Great actress. Too politically biased.,8,4 December 2020,"The first Borat used to make fun of everybody. The second specifically targets Trump and his supporters, and it ends with an invitation to go to vote at the elections, implicitly but inequivocally in favour of Biden.
I am not a Trump supporter. (I am not a USA citizen). But I found the film too politically oriented, as if Baron Coehn were a Dem activist.This is not the only issue. it is also less funny than the first, which was so ingenious and fresh that no sequel could probably measure up to itHaving said that, Borat 2 remains an excellent film, defintely worth watching, and not just once (i have watched it 3-4 times).
The Covid theme is very well played. It was obviously not planned from the beginning, but it fits very well into the story.Maria Bakalova, of whom I have never heard before, is so good as to cast shadow on Baron Cohen himself in certain scenes. She is not as beautiful and sexy as Hollywood actresses, but her acting (in a very difficult role) is absolutely amazing, magnificent, 100 times better than Hollywood actresses",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm
392,juanquaglia,Borat lost his way,3,23 October 2020,"I was a huge fan of Sacha Baron Cohen until this point. I enjoyed Borat, Bruno and Who is America? a lot, and I considered him one of the greatest American comedians. But what he has done here left me deeply disappointed and even angry.
Borat Subsequent Moviefilm has a couple of great moments, but most of the film is scripted, with few real situations. So overall the film is less enjoyable than the previous one. It is understandable, though. Probably Borat's job is a bit more difficult now that he is recognised everywhere, so I imagine it's quite difficult to find unsuspecting victims.
It is also understandable that real scenes are edited in a way to make them look funnier than they really are. The Pence rally we saw in the trailer seemed very funny, but when checking raw filming from people who were actually there we soon realise nothing happened the way it's been shown. Again, I understand it's part of making a movie.
What I can't forgive is dishonest editing. The famous Rudy Giuliani scene that appeared everywhere as a news story and is supposed to be the highlight of the film is probably the most dishonest and misleading piece of cinematic narration I've ever watched. The editing goes crazy there, with several fragments that last 3 seconds. I'd love to see the raw material from that scene, because I have no doubts it has been presented in a very insidious way.
The other source of disappointment is that overall it seemed like an anti-Trump film more than a Borat film. The propaganda seems to take over the comedy. The timing of the release, so close to the election, also contributes to this interpretation.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

However....I have to deduct some stars here because this is blatant one-sided political propaganda. Not being a US citizen myself, it's shockingly obvious. It's almost as if someone funded Cohen to resurrect Borat and make this film. It's release timing - sponsored by Amazon no less - was to release it right before the US election in 2020. It even has the temerity to tell it's audience to go and vote before the credits roll - as if it has programmed you ahead of time on how to vote.Cohen likes to think that he's exposing people's subconscious biases by putting ordinary people into compromising situations and seeing how they react.
Most instances in this film involve shopkeepers who are only too happy to help Borat because they need the money and understand that the customer is always right - no matter how obnoxious. I didn't see people subscribe to Borat's twisted worldview. I saw ordinary people just hanging in there and playing along until Borat would go away.
Secondly, it's also hard to tell what is truly candid and what was staged - so it loses some power there too.There are some truly funny and cringeworthy moments if you subscribe to Cohen's warped worldview though. Unfortunately it's not quite as funny as the first film, and when the elections are done and dusted, I fear that the movie may not stand on it's own.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

This film had arrived in such an aproppiate time that is unbelieveable, makes fun of Trump, Coronavirus and much more on a unique way that only our lord Sacha Baron Cohen could handle, and shows in this film his extraordinary talent not only because of his comic power (And method acting) but for being the kind of activist that we need right now, not the stupid type of activism who focus on victimism, but a comic and funny activism who searches for showing us the true colors of American Society without any political correction.
Also Maria did an amazing job portraying Borat´s daughter, she steals the scenes a lot of time and i hope for her to have a great future on acting
Another thing i personally liked is the evolution of the plot, the first Borat film was just a road movie, this one instead is a complicated plot full of conflicts and problems and most of all the Cringe-Heartwarming evolution between Borat and his daughterUnfortunately unlike its predecessor, Borat Subsequent Moviefilm, just focus the main attack on the Republican Party a few months before elections, which is sad and dull because the first one makes fun about all types of North American, and what we really needed as an audience is variety of laughs and weird types of American people to make fun of.
Also another thing that i disliked (besides some weird montage) It´s probably how rushed the experience felt, i know this film was made in secret but even in that way I wanted more Borat, more Jokes more everything, but it felt really short like a synopsis of the film instead of the actual film.But even with those problems, a really wonderful film to watch and laugh, truly the film we needed during this times",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

More focus feels given to the fictional being of our Kazakh characters than it does actual reality. At times it comes off too in-your-face with the scriptedness or blatant editing, so the film never gives a chance for reality and its genuine characters to breath with same earnest reactions as the original film.While the film starts and finishes with a heavy-handed partisanship, it does work surprisingly well for the script and in today's political scene.

This new film proves this with alarming cringeworthyness.
The film is tired, over the top, politically biased and just not that funny. It aims to offend and shock but at the expense of entertainment. There is a Tom Greenish quality to the film where Baron Cohen indulges himself in his own opinions and beliefs where it ends up trying way too hard.
If you like the over the top and not especially funny shock factor in films like Freddy got fingered then this is for you.

Every sensitive issue that exists today, Cohen broke it with nothing more than the truth that is so much being concealed.
Even if the scenes are fake, he talked about subjects that no one really wanted to talk, and that's why this movie is going to get controversial and some people will obviously hate it. But that was its objective and it means Sacha Baron Cohen did an amazing job.

Just like the original, The Subsequent Moviefilm has a large handful of shocking and laugh-out-loud moments. Borat 2 also has many somewhat amusing jokes, and several gags that aren't that funny, but this is to be expected from nearly any comedy these days. My only real criticism of the sequel is that it feels very relevant to the current events of 2020, so it may not be nearly as funny in five years or so.

437,maxwelloreocookie,"Boring, unfunny, and way too much (bad)plot.",2,24 October 2020,"Love it or hate it, the first Borat movie is a modern classic. We may get annoyed by the bad impressions people constantly do of Borat, but I still find the first movie brilliant. Obviously it's very rare for sequel to be as good as the original, let alone better, so my expectations for this wasn't that high, but damn, I wasn't expecting this movie to be this bad.First of all, this movie is way too heavy on plot and light on laughs. I may have only chuckled 2 or 3 times in the whole movie. As for the actual skits, none were even close to funny as classic as to the ones in the first movie and show.Mockumentaries like this don't need to be heavy on plot. The first Borat was super light on actual plot. The plot is just him learning and gathering information from America, but the real plot is just him trying to get sexy time with Pamela Anderson, and that's what makes it funny. Then from that basic plot we get a bunch of cleverly woven sketches from that, and the movie never came to a screeching halt when that plot showed up. Unlike this second movie, the plot of this movie is way too in your face, and it's not even a good plot, it's super cliché, overly sappy, and predictable. I knew exactly what was gunna happen right after seeing the daughter for the first time. Hell, I even knew what was gunna happen when they showed the daughter in the trailer. If you seen any cliché family movie ever, you will know what happens.As for the daughter, I guess she did a good job for what she had to work with, but she was still annoying to me. I know that's kinda the point that she's supposed to be annoying, but it still doesn't change the fact she annoyed me most the time, and her plot was boring and unfunny. I miss Azamat.Obviously I support women's rights and always have. I still support that message, but it was just executed horribly, because it was super unfunny and boring. A comedy is supposed to be funny and entertaining. Having a good message in a movie doesn't automatically make it good, and doesn't automatically make someone a bad person for not liking the movie itself. So I 100% support the message of the movie, but never want to see this boring unfunny movie again.As for politics, I don't care what which side of politics anyone is or what this movie is on. All I care about is if the movie is funny and good, which it isn't. But this movie movie is super preachy with it's side on politics. Where did this even come from? The first movie was nothing like this and just fun. What happened? I wouldn't mind the preachy politics and bad plot if the movie was actually funny, but it isn't.This is Sascha's worst movie by far, and I seen them all except for Brothers Grimsby. Borat 2 makes Bruno look like a masterpiece. Sacha Baron Cohen has lost his magic. Maybe's he's just too old now, who knows? All I know is that Borat 2 was horrendous. I'm very hard to offend, and Sashca's style has literally never offended me for real. It has nothing to do with if it's offensive or not, I just find the movie super unfunny and boring. To the people thumbing me down, I highly doubt you want to rewatch this movie over and over with friends like the first one. Do you? You are just thumbing me down cuz the movie supports your political views.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

That felt much more like a documentary than a movie, in some parts. This movie did the reverse thing in having an in-movie storyline as a main thing, and the interactions with an unsuspecting public not the primary task of this movie. I can understand why with the ongoing pandemic. But this had the feeling and a presentation of a movie much more so than the first movie.My favourite scene was the fertility dance.

Sacha is his usual amazing self, always staying in character through situations that would quite frankly have me pissing my pants laughing. The real treat here is his daughter. I've never seen Maria Bakalova before, but she more than holds her own on the screen and even outshines in a lot of scenes. Equally as fearless and fun as Sacha and a great sport for putting herself in a potentially bad situation with a prominent American figure. Trump supporters will no doubt cry fake and throw stones, but without verging into spoiler territory I'd say it was pretty obvious what happened and I'll say no more, other than I doubt Sacha would compromise his artistic integrity by lying.

Well, as it happens, the truth is stranger than fiction, even if the concept of truth simply does not exist in this case. The continuation, of course, is more like a propaganda campaign for Biden, but it must be said that it took Cohen 14 years to get Borat back on the screens. Realizing that this character was a victim of his own success and could no longer fool people, the Kazakh reporter's sequel is exhumed with all possible cynicism: he has evolved in the right direction and is not a blind copy of the original; yet the sequel has added interesting, relevant ideas to the modern world.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

Is this belated sequel (one that I personally never thought would get made) any good???
HELL YES!!!! It's not as candid or as raw as the original film, but with Mr Baron Cohen not being able to dupe because he is recognised by so many now this film still has the power to make you fall off your seat laughing, cringe at what is happening and be shocked (in at least two scenes all of these at once)Thank you Sascha Baron for bringing back yoir most endearing character...

Borat's daughter really took the craziness level up a notch. She's totally uninhibited and basically insane, like her father. She really went ""there"" - held nothing back and as a result we got some pretty great scenes. The two of them - Borat and daughter - make a really compelling duo. I'd say the movie loses its steam around the last fourth. The pace is slower and my attention span waned. There were many great moments, notably the baby scene, the tech guru scene and the women's meeting. For some reason, and maybe because in general humour is a lot more crude these days, that the first Borat movie was more risque for its time and did a better job at depicting middle America.

461,danielladue,Social commentary disguised as comedy,8,26 October 2020,"The first Borat film had plenty to offer in social comedy, but most of it was for shock value, and just get people to see a cross section of Americans for who they are. None of it was meant to hurt anyone, or make any big statements, but instead to entertain.It became very obvious early on that this sequel is much more about social commentary, and the political atmosphere of the time. The year 2020 has been an absolute circus, and this film is only a reflection of what we have become. Many people have said that this version is not as funny as the original, but I would argue that is nearly impossible. The first Borat film had nothing to compare it to, and thus the shock value was higher. Now we already know what to expect with the added fact that nothing feels shocking in the year 2020. Overall, I'd say that this film is indeed not quite as funny, but it did more provide more substance (weird to say about a Borat film). Sacha Baron Cohen has even admitted that he felt in danger of his life a few times, and that is a bit different than last time around. Say whatever you want about that goofy weirdo, but he is highly intelligent, and figures out how to get people to show their true nature.Lastly, we all want to see and interpret the infamous scene with Rudy Giuliani. Unfortunately, the response from Americans has been just as divided as everything else, proving the point even further. Democrats see one thing, and the Conservatives see something else. In my opinion it was pretty bad, but not quite the pedeophile stretch it was reported as, but that's just my take. I will be honest, and tell anyone of the Trump persuasion that they probably won't enjoy this at all, but overall the film has a lot of insight to anyone who isn't emotionally tied to the current administration.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm
462,johnterrell-67238,Substandard At Best,4,3 April 2021,"Borat Subsequent Moviefilm or (Delivery of Prodigious Bribe to American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan) is the follow up film to the classic 2006 comedy mockumentary Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan. Yeah, the titles are pretty humorous in themselves. The first Borat movie has to one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It's hugely offensive yet rarely too in your face. It is also is able to pack a subtle yet effective message about how America (and other countries to be fair) treat people who come from different cultures. However, Borat (2006) is first and for most a comedy film. The joke-per-minute ratio of that movie is insane and the fact that most of the jokes land make it that much better. When I heard that a sequel to this movie was coming out, I was both excited and skeptical. Since the character of Borat is so well known, it was going to be much harder to prank unsuspecting people. Add that to the fact that everyone is used to being recorded and are more cautious of what they say on camera than they were in 2006. However, I was still anticipating the release. Unfortunately, my doubts were somewhat proved right when I watched the film. It's not the worst thing in the world or anything, but it is far from even getting close to living up to the original. I doubt I'll think about it too much in the future.Borat Subsequent Moviefilm suffers from many things that are almost unavoidable. To avoid everyone recognizing him, Borat is dressed in a disguise for a lot of the movie. This takes away a lot of magic from the iconic character. And as many suspected, the reactions just aren't as funny. The plot of the movie is also very poor. The reason for all of the events in the movie happening in the first place is very uninteresting. The movie, all in all, is just kind of unnecessary. It almost has no plot. It honestly feels more like a collection of skits tied together by a thin string rather than a concise narrative.The movie does include Borat's daughter which could be an interesting direction, but falls flat most of the time. While they do have their moments, there was an endless amount of cheesy, hammed fisted ""emotional"" scenes between the two that just get on your nerves at a certain point.Finally, let's talk about the jokes and the pranks. They are very hit or miss. There are definitely some funny jokes in this movie. I laughed during the film... but there was also a lot of sitting in silence. The jokes in this movie can be incredibly in your face. Sometimes it feels as if the filmmakers are on their knees and begging you to laugh. There are also too many jokes just meant to disgust you. I've personally never found that brand of humor funny, especially when those kind of jokes just go on too long as they do in this film. However, in no way am I saying that it is devoid of laughter, and anyone who watches it should get at least a few laughs.Now, I don't want it to sound like I hate this movie or anything. I was mildly entertained for most of it and there seemed to be stretches in the movie where it seemed like it was picking up the pace a bit. I also really enjoyed the reveal at the end of the movie... and once again it made me laugh. Sacha Baron Cohen is also just as just as great as Borat, even if the writing is a huge step down from the first film.My favorite part of the movie might the non-actor Jeanise Jones. A lot of my favorite parts within the movie were centered around her, and I think a lot of people are agreeing with me after seeing the overall positive reaction to her after the release. Also Cohen donated 100,000 dollars to her church. Very naiiiice!All in all, Borat: Subsequent Moviefilm is a very disappointing movie. Sadly, it's a movie with no subtlety, whether it be for it's themes or jokes. It's a movie that is messy, unfocused, inconsistent in quality, and has writing that can sometimes feel like the filmmakers just threw every idea at the wall and hoped that some of it stuck. However, it is a movie where some things do stick. That being said, Borat: Subsequent Moviefilm is not a complete disaster. It also has a nice heart to it. All this adds to a movie with some good stuff in it that might mildly entertain an audience for a short amount of time, but also too many blatant flaws to be considered anything but a somewhat disappointing return for such an iconic character. I just don't think Borat: Subsequent Moviefilm needed to be made and it never did nothing to convince me otherwise. Substandard at best.4.5 - 5.0.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm
463,wicj,We See What We Want To See,6,25 October 2020,"This is Borat 2. If you didn't get the humor of the first Borat movie you won't get it here either so don't bother watching or reviewing this. Like the first one, this movie had me laughing at the over-the-top portrayal of a backwards man from a backwards country with a lot of stupid sex jokes and shock-material. I also laughed at the all-to-real backwards Americans with the understanding that a lot of what we are seeing is very cleverly edited to make the dupes seem even more ridiculous. If you read interviews of the dupes from the first movie you realize that all is not as it seems. Hours worth of footage is presented as minute-long encounters in which people say really stupid things or appear to agree with Borat on some very risque subjects. So, TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT! I'm sure that we'll hear more stories of how Sasha Baron Cohen and his crew deceived or otherwise bamboozled the people in the movie to act as they did, but we will most likely also conclude that fancy editing aside, some of those people really did say some pretty offensive things. For example, it really doesn't matter how silly a song Borat was singing to the crowd of Texans to make them all look like imbecilic conspiracy theorists, the guy who throws a Nazi salute up is an over-the-top moron.
Like the first movie, this one had too many scenes that seem too contrived and a stretch of the imagination in order to shock or get laughs. Some of it just wasn't all that funny to me, but it had plenty of laughs otherwise. All-in-all, it was entertaining and I watched it for free thanks to Amazon Prime.
But wait -- there's more! I have to take issue with the way that the media, Cohen and the production company have portrayed Rudy Giuliani here. I admit that I was a Rudy fan when I lived in New York and was very impressed with the way he conducted himself on 9/11, but I think he's lost his mind with age and has become nothing short of a hand-puppet for the most (the hugist) imbecilic conspiracy theorist, McDonald Trump. That said, I felt manipulated by the footage of Rudy and had to rewind it several times to try to align what I saw with what I read in the press. CNN and the New York Times would have us believe that he was caught making sexy time (or trying to) with Borat's daughter. What I saw was him stupidly agreeing to finish the interview in the bedroom with an attractive, much younger woman and being a bit touchy-feely (patting her on her hip). What I also saw was a quick shot of him trying to get her hair or microphone or something out of a button or zipper on the top of her dress. It appears that we are missing the lead-up to this, like, perhaps, her asking for him to help her get unstuck) making it even more likely that it was edited to make it look like he was unbuttoning her to get her undressed. The press made a very big deal about him laying on the bed putting his hands down his pants ostensibly to touch his penis. What I saw was her taking his microphone unit from the waist of his pants (you can see it in her hand as she lifts her hands from his pants) and then he lays back to tuck his shirt back in; anyone else who is a bit overweight with a larger belly knows that this is an efficient way to get tucked back in. I understand that the Trump administration is a bunch of ass-clowns just asking to be made fun of, but let's at least show the real stupidity of these people without resorting to the very type of fakery that the conspiracy theorists point to as proof that the holocaust never occurred. And stop feeding the extreme left-wing nut-jobs at CNN and the New York Times.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

Very Cringe-worthy ( in a bad way ) .. bad acting and just not worth viewing.. the worst things are the staged reactions.. nothing is ' believable ' about this movie.. sad and annoying.. the actress who plays Borat's Daughter comes across as insincere, fake and unfunny... that is the one word that sticks out most..

465,jonnaharkenson,Plenty Of Hard Laughing & Jaw Dropping,10,26 July 2021,"This movie made me laugh hard, more than I usually do with comedy films, and my jaw dropped and I covered my mouth many times in disbelief of some of the outrageous scenes. This movie is very similar to to the movie, 'Bad Grandpa'... it has a scripted storyline with plenty of unscripted reality comedy, the reactions from people were 100% real and they had no idea it was going to be a movie! This kind of film is extremely difficult to make, it takes tremendous effort, bravery, and patience.. and they risk their lives to make this film (in the scene where Borat sings his new song, he had to wear body armor, and he was chased out by an angry mob which you can watch the behind the scenes video clip of this online). Both Sacha and Maria Bakalova only had one chance to film some of the scenes, and they never broke character.. so I give them tremendous props for their stellar performance. The storyline was a little generic and it wasn't that great, but the interactions with people was very good and funny.. you will see a variety of people in the movie, some are totally disgusting people, but some are very genuine.. Sacha is a genius in a way he gets people to show their true colors, he lets their guard down and make them comfortable (or uncomfortable) enough to act out their real selves.Overall, I never have laughed so hard with any other films besides reality comedy films from Sacha, there is just very interesting dynamic between the Borat character and everyday ordinary people he meets and interacts with. Sacha is just pointing the cameras at people, how they act and respond are totally 100% who they really are. It's a difficult movie to make and the two lead actors did an incredible job doing something that's very difficult and sometimes dangerous to do, and they did make millions of people laugh very hard, including myself!",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

470,user-415-133374,Make no Mistake - This Movie is about Human Trafficking,5,23 October 2020,"I really liked the first movie and I understand what Sacha Cohen is trying to do here. He had to top his first movie by making this one even more cruder and offensive than the first, and at that he succeeded. In the Borat style, the film is clever and some of his anecdotes are brilliant and hilarious (leading the viewer to think he is about to call Trump a bad President, for instance, only to then say Obama was the dictator and Trump was a Strongman Savior)With that said, there is also a very dark side of this film which essentially is that Sacha Cohen is making light and poking fun at human trafficking. The entire plot revolved around giving his daughter as a bride to a rich powerful man, and at several points Borat says he is ""selling her to her new owner"". She is made to live in a cage and at several points Borat says he has raped her simply because he wanted to and had gotten her pregnant as a result.Honestly, at least in my opinion, the film does go a little bit too far especially since the real Kazakhstan, as with many of the former Soviet republics, does have a very serious problem with human trafficking. I'm sure some people will say its only a movie, and they would be right, but what if there were scenes of the daughter getting beaten or raped by multiple men and forced into prostitution. That is the reality that this movie is essentially making fun of and it wouldn't be so funny then.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

I'm pretty centrist but I could tell how biased this movie is. They only went after republicans. I wish that he would have gone after Democrats and their supporters too.I was thinking maybe he would go after the other side but it never happened. He just mocked Trump supporters by finding the most extreme ones.

488,billiejoesmum,Prefer it to the first.,9,25 October 2020,"Warning: Spoilers!I actually think this is the better film/movie. It relies less on toilet & vulgar humour to embarrass unsuspecting victims, and on more (in comparison!) subtle commentary on human behaviour and attitudes to deceive people into exposing their own views and reactions.The 'moon blood dance' went wayyyy too far. Without being too frank, even a woman/girl from a poor country wouldn't allow herself to deliberately leak through to the point of spoiling an expensive dress that would be extremely special for her. It just isn't that messy unless you don't use protection.
I know it's for comedic effect, I just think it was more crass than funny and spoilt the tone of the film (even with all it's anoos jokes).The rest was pretty clever though.The pro-life pastor being more interested in saving the ""baby"" than Borat seemingly admitting to sexual assault, child abuse & incest; the plastic surgeon nodding along to his description of the 'jew nose' and happily telling Borat what he recommends doing to his daughter's body whilst not directing any of the consultation to her until she asks if he'd 'sex attack' her; the dress shop owner just laughing when he asks for a 'no means yes' dress; his hosts openly admitting that they think that the Clintons drink children's blood and that Democrats shouldn't have rights, then later claiming that the Holocaust is a hoax (!); his song at the rally with the audience all happily singing back that various people should be injected with 'Wuhan flu' (that 2s ago they sang was a hoax) or chopped up like Saudi's; and the whole Rudi interview... all set up some very shocking, but funny & clever ways of exposing some of the extreme beliefs and behaviours towards certain people that permeate through society.Only the Instagram influencer is listed in the credits, and they mention that they explained in advance to the elderly holocaust survivors (that would have been rather cruel), so I can only assume that the others were being themselves on camera.The timing was just right for this sequel, with Covid & the US election in 10d. I'm not sure if they jumped on the opportunity to use Covid as a plot line, or it was just a coincidence that they were already filming, but it was a great way of showcasing some of the crazy things going on.Baron Cohen has a great talent for taking a silly character & a silly story and using them to create a clever narrative on the things he gets to observe.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

The difference is the change to a screenwriting committee, different director and bringing in a female sidekick. When it comes to slapstick political satire comedy I'm pretty tolerant but this movie was mostly just annoying. I felt it was framed around two scenes with Mike Pence and Rudy Giuliani and the rest was a weak plot to get there. Of course there were some funny ridiculous scenes but they didn't add up to an enjoyable, cohesive film.

There was to much time spent between Borat and his daughter which isn't what borat should be about it's about him being funny and making people uncomfortable. I get it people recognized him and that can be difficult and with saying that then I'm sorry don't make another movie then. This looked like a crash grab and or a political hit job to just say what everyone already hears in movies now which is trump sucks, vote Democrat. Okay we get it now can we get back to making movies funny and good again. I'm not political and sometimes I just don't want to hear it all the time when I just wanna sit back and watch a movie. I'm saying that there where some funny moments like when he's stuck inside with those two men other then that everything felt like the people where told there was a camera and didn't make it authentic. It was just weird to see a sequel of a movie that was such a cultural phenomenon and then completely make it about politics I mean everything was and then also making it very staged. So, in conclusion it was okay some funny parts but overall if I was to tell you that another borat movie came out you would not expect this kinda movie at all. Also I'm kinda curious after this election how movies will be made if Biden wins because for the past five years we've heard and have seen the same jokes rehashed over and over so if he's not there anymore what will movies look like?

Furthermore the sense of deja vu is overwhelming as SBC recycled far too much from the original and it just does not work in 2020. Introducing a significantly new character is often a sign of desperation and the introduction of Borat's daughter Tutar is no exception. She's like Scrappy doo in Scooby doo or the sand snakes in Game of thrones. Tutar is another awful character but I understand why she was necessary as Borat is too well known in 2020 to trick people into an interview. It begs the question was this film necessary? I would say definitely not. For me it has soured the Borat character and taken some shine from the original film. SBC is a genius but I can only imagine that he was forced into making this film for political reasons.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm
517,mhuseman-20255,LOLOLOL,10,24 October 2020,I loved this movie! I watched by myself and literally laughed OUT LOUD at least every 5-10 minutes!. I love Sacha Baron Cohen and Maria Bakalova was excellent in her role. They had me in tears I was laughing so hard. I needed a great comedy to watch and it's hard to find one that keeps my attention; I will be watching again for a nonstop LOLfest! Thank you for making this for us especially at a time where we could all use cracking up in a good way!,Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

520,minxxy-36849,It's time for Borat to grow up,1,25 October 2020,"Like many of the people who have commented on here, I have enjoyed Cohen's previous work... but this is frankly appalling and I am not sure what film the people who have this anything over a 5 have been watching as it certainly wasn't the same one that I watched.Ok, the film is trying to expose the ridiculous politics and clash of cultures, but what really stuck out to me was a complete lack of respect for those who have lost people to COVID, or have suffered sexual abuse from Hollywood stars. These are all fairly raw subjects and I see no reason why this film needed to be released now. Why would amazon put money into this disgusting display is beyond me.Aside from the topical faux pas, this is the same old jokes and the same old gig of getting abhorrent people to get in to situations which make them look ridiculous, which, ok, can be amusing at times, but just watching this just left me feeling annoyed rather than the piece of escapism I was hoping for.Cohen has lost his way and probably should settle back for a life off camera now as the 90s is over and the world is moving in from childish satire.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

It's just masterful how Sacha was able to pull this off being that everyone knows him, there was a pandemic and shutdown. And the cherry on all of this was Rudy Giuliani who didn't know about his involvement to the film until the very week it was released. Also he made himself look extremely creepier than usual.

523,rzahrai,Far beyond a comedy: incredibly intelligent political satire,9,24 October 2020,"Far more politically exposing than the first, Borat 2 is a raw expose of US power and political relations far beyond slapstick humour. The inconsistencies in American right-wing factional thought, mysogynism and the moral laxity of an uninformed, conspiracy theory touting conservative base is brought to light with some intelligent humour and outright outrageous scenes.

524,linear-descent,So disappointing compared to the first,2,27 December 2020,"As a huge fan of the original Borat movie, I was so excited to watch the sequel.
The previews on Amazon Prime looked hilarious. Even the title for the sequel sounded hilarious. Sadly, the movie is a huge disappointment. Everything feels scripted. The reason the first movie was so great and funny was that everything looked candid and spontaneous, (even if it wasn't).This movie is absolutely inferior to the original, and relies way too much on crude humor instead of actual humor for laughs. And there really isn't that much to laugh at. True, the first movie also used a fair amount of shock-value scenes, but the laughs came from watching the reactions of Borat's unknowing targets on camera. With this sequel, it feels like the jokes are being done to shock the audience, and not the people in the movie, and the people on the movie all look like they're already in on the joke.A lot of the skits/scenes fall flat. Many of what Borat does is supposed to be offensive, and it's his innocent offensiveness that generates laughs, but in this sequel most of it is so unnecessarily over-the-top offensive that it's just cringe after cringe and devoid of humor. I laughed a few times, but it wasn't like the first where I felt I was laughing for most of the film.So disappointed. So, so disappointed.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

That being said, this movie is a solid comedy with plenty of chuckles and some great laugh-out-loud moments.

Cohen is like marmite, you either love him or hate him but I for one love everything he does.
Special shout out has to go to Maria Bakalova. She was amazing in her first role and was as funny as Sacha. They made an excellent team and I hope to see them together in future films.

The issue is though that everyone knows who Borat is now, compared to some weird dude causing chaos like back in the day. It just wasn't to be, Borat pulled a fan club almost everywhere he went and the subtlety of the gags in the places he wasn't recognised were pretty slim.The political agenda was disappointing as well. I wish everything wasn't about politics during the last presidency term, I'm so glad that nonsense is over. This film is another victim of that mania.Sure I had a few laughs, it wasn't a lost cause, but I won't be watching it again. I rate it mediocre at best.

Over all I'm pleasantly surprised by the sequal because usually the 2nd never equals the first movies but this time I can whole heartily say Borat 2 is amazing and everyone needs to see it.

It had more heart in it too. The relationship growth between Borat and his daughter Tutar was kind of sweet.I enjoyed being horrified by the extremely uncomfortable moments. All except the part regarding Rudy Giuliani. The Tutar character (Borat's daughter) poses as a reporter to interview ""America's Mayor"". She's nervous, awestruck, flirtatious, and the old man just ate that up. He kept reaching across to touch her hands to ""reassure"" her. He has no problem being led into a bedroom by her and even lays back on the bed to adjust something in his pants. Zero funny about that.Unlike all the other uncomfortable moments in the film, this part just angered and nauseated me. It wasn't rehearsed or fictional, and I guess that's the point. That was the Real Rudy. A creepy and lecherous monster. A definite skin-crawling scene.Seems like Sacha Baron Cohen has matured. He wrote a much better film that mixes the fictional characters with the real people in a more effective way. In the first Borat film, which I didn't hate, just wasn't keen on it, the character was obnoxious for obnoxiousness sake. This time around, there's a definite message.Oh yeah, and there are lots of gross-out moments, much to the amusement of the 13-year-old portion of my brain.

Whether this was because SBC is stuck for new material, money or is so desperate to push his own political agenda...it doesn't really matter, it should still be somewhat intelligent and entertaining. It's not, it's crass, crude, dumb toilet humour, fart jokes included.

Ultimately, I decided to take the movie as an original parody.The ""second"" Borat now is an imitation of the first Borat. The imitation of an imitation fails because it tries to maintain a form, while losing its substance. The new Borat loosely reminded me of the risqué jokes of the original Borat, but with barely any genuinely fresh fun and with practically no new message. I wish this Borat imitation by Borat didn't happen, so the first Borat remained a valuable original.I gave a point for bringing up the theme of the Holocaust and having it inadvertently recognized. Thank you!UPDATE:
The clown now thinks his movie has become reality, that he is above the legal institutions and law of the United States. He gives directions in current political events as if he is directing his movie. He thinks he is that important. The line between reality and movie has been crossed. Bad art now wants to become reality.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

I thought it would be a big let down but to my surprise it was on par with first one. While I do still like the first one a bit more. I liked the story and where they took Borat's character. Adding his daughter into the mix was hilarious and where they go with it I didn't see coming especially with Borat's character. Although a lot more this time around is scripted the non- scripted parts are still great but are no where near as close to the first. Although the moment with a political figure I don't see how that figure will comeback from this.

Contrived and lacking anything interesting bar a slightly creepy Rudy Guliiani - which seems to be the only selling point the media have latched on to (which is maybe a hint at how bad the rest of the content is for those bothered to watch to the end).For what it's worth, I'm from the UK, left leaning politically and very much anti Trump and his lackeys, which maybe makes the missed opportunity to do something clever and insightful, the biggest disappointment.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

I understand he wanted to do an anti-Trump movie, and release it before the elections, but this is Borat. This is not the Cohen TV show. Borat is a figure that we enjoyed world wide and was the sarcasm of the capitilistic West and the former Soviet, looking for a modern identity, wannabe capitalistic but still Soviet East.

It was a bold, unique concept of an exaggerated eastern-european stereotype that goes to the US and screws with people there REGARDLESS of ideology. The movie did not need a sequel, but it got one anyway. In this one, Sacha Baron Cohen seems less concerned with comedy and pulling off meaningfull and successfull pranks and more with making a political statement. You see, the magic of the first film is that the movie approached western society from a completely oblivious, ignorant standpoint, it did not choose right-wing people exclusively as targets. Don't get me wrong, I'm not bothered by Cohen's ""anti-Trump"" or whatever stance one bit, but by letting comedy suffer in favor of it.It occasionaly does contain funny one-liners and phrases outside of its sketches, and I also liked the opening of the film.

629,imdb-13900,Truly magnificent,10,25 October 2020,"Just when you thought it was impossible to represent the US Republican ""alt-right"" community as any more absurd prejudiced and irrational than they choose to present themselves, in comes Sasha Baron Cohen in a series of exquisitely crafted ""set up"" mock interviews with ""real life"" participants.
By using the twinned barrelled foils of flattery, and apparent ignorance, he skilfully manages to expose the irrationality and inconsistencies of the current Trump administration and their supporters.
A great deal of effort has been made to sandwich carefully written ""backstories"" along with exquisite editing to create a strangely compelling narrative, worthy of the best ""screwball"" comedies, yet remaining overwhelmingly unsettling because it features ""real words, from real talking heads""
On many occasions the transition from ""made up"" to ""real life"" clips is entirely seamless - situations are clearly taken out of context, and doubtless we only get to see the ""best bits"" but nonetheless it's genuinely funny, and on occasions, excruciatingly uncomfortable.
Make no mistake, Cohen doesn't pull any punches, there is no attempt at ""balancing"" his argument, clearly there are scenes where they use actors who are ""in on the joke"" from the start and at others, it's only apparent in retrospect this must have been the case. Nevertheless, he makes a point, and makes a point well, that people should always challenge accepted norms, and the first thing you should ask is ""exactly what does this person stand for, and why does that benefit us"".
One of the great joys of this movie is that it's ""bang up to the minute"" - not only does it reflect the current US political agenda, it has in many ways contributed to that discourse.
It's rude, bawdy, and on occasions, deliberately revolting. I very nearly pressed the >> button a couple of times, but was immediately glad I didn't.
I found it immensely enjoyable, if you don't, you should take a long hard look at yourself, and question whether you're precisely one of the people he tries to satirise.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

The laughter invariably came through gritted teeth, clenched fists and pure dread.There was plenty of the usual Borat gross-out stuff, coming in both physical and moral forms but what surprised was there was genuine heart of the film...Enter... Maria Bakalova. Wow. I fell in love with her character in the first five mins. Her intensity and commitment never lets up... Her performance is beyond words... hilarious, terrifying and heart-breakingly enchanting throughout.But what an all round team effort - putting this together would have been a logistical nightmare. Respect to Sacha Baron Cohen for noticing talent when he sees it and being generous enough to give over screen time to Bakalova.It's a really is a brilliant sweet movie.Enjoy.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm
657,hoohaa79,Oh dear!!!,1,2 November 2020,"What me and my girlfriend knew about SBC before watching this movie.Politically left leaning (like most of the Hollywood elite), has TDS.Made millions from his movies and tv by way of offending people, but ironically is a staunch supporter of increased censorship of the internet especially across all social media platforms.
Now we have no issue with comedians offending people, freedom of speech and expression is something we value a great deal.
But we do have an issue with his sheer hypocrisy.That said, we have both enjoyed his films over the years
While Borat wasn't our favourite, it was still edgy and cool.
This movie, is not edgy and cool.
It's way more scripted, and by the time we reached 35 minutes we had lost hope and interest.If you are not politically active we still don't think many who saw his first movie would find this anywhere near as good, in fact parts of it was absolute cringe...and not in a good way.
If you are politically active (Republican, Conservative) then you will quickly see that this film is a rushed hatchet job spewed out during the election campaign.First timers, particularly the younger generation might giggle a little (not much), but older viewers who know how funny he can be will just feel sheer disappointment.It's an abortion of a movie, just glad we didn't have to pay for it exclusively as we have Amazon Prime.If you are also left leaning then perhaps you will enjoy the digs at Trump, Pence and Giuliani, but they are just political digs and not that funny at all.
In doing so SBC alienated half of the politically active audience, but the movie isn't funny enough to fully engage the other half either.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

The exclusion of Azamat was sad as the dynamics of Borat and Azamat was missing. Borat 1 was fully focused on humor with a mild attempt at building a story which was infinitely better than trying to build a family oriented story with a splash of political humor. Maybe Sacha fears how the leftist will eat him up if he continues mocking Kazakhstan. If this continues Borat movies will eventually loose its charm and will pretty much become a traditional Hollywood movie which takes a jibe at American politics which the rest of the world doesn't care about. Maria has done a good job in her portrayal as Borats daughter but there is no replacing Azamat as Borat's true companion.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

Obviously it's from a liberal standpoint there's no attempt made to present both viewpoints, any more than there is in a Michael Moore movie. There are certainly funny moments but it's not nearly as outrageous as the original. And there is some hearts in this movie as a relationship between the two protagonists grows. The part with Rudolph Giuliani is way overblown. The only person I saw touching knees was her touching him. He pats her lightly on the back not the rear end and to me it looked much more fatherly than lecherous. She made every attempt in removing his sound equipment and coaxing him into the bedroom to make him look foolish and it failed. He was simply tucking in his pants. Much ado about nothing his treatment of her was fatherly not lecherous.

He didn't make any statements about America that are new or reveal anything we don't already know.

Now of course with this year in America being as insane as it is there's a lot of material to work with, and I like that Sacha Baron Cohen returned to this character after all this time with a clear purpose behind the offensiveness and shocking shenanigans. However, what was so great about the original was that the comedy and reactions were at the forefront, with the satire and hidden message behind the encounters much more subtle and cleverly hidden. This did result in a lot of claims of anti-semitism, racism and the like (it's easier to be offended than to think about jokes) but I liked how the film functioned in two different ways for everyone to enjoy - a hilarious Jackass-esque prank movie and a clever satire on the hidden prejudices and social problems of America.This time around it's still enjoyable, funny and even shocking in parts, but the comedy seems to be built to accommodate the message, and so sometimes comes off as forced or even preachy.

But was entertaining at times and the segment with ballroom was hysterical and very masterfully done.It all fell apart when the interview came along. Tutar completely fell out of character when she started using her actual real-world charms and gestures (that rub on his knee) as a lead in to get him into that bedroom. If she was in actual character, she would have pulled her pants down and showed him her bloody bush right there during the actual interview, asking him to marry her.

NOT!,2,1 September 2021,"Yes I'm a socially liberal, open minded person who thinks Trump is an existential threat to the world, but this moviefilm was not very good. Sorry, not sorry.The original Borat film was edgy with some funny bits, even if I found it to be more cringey, than anything. That's the point of the shtick, pushing the boundaries. I can respect art if there's a deeper meaning to it or something groundbreaking, willing to push boundaries. With that said, Borat 2 was a long cringefest. Where the first film blurred the lines between reality and satire, the second felt like a lazy, juvenile, overly scripted mess.Before laying it on thick, I will say that Borat 2 had a few things going for it. Some of Cohen's humor was delivered in a way that tries to warn of growing dangers in current-day America. From conspiracy theories going mainstream to the downright dangerous right-wing, Cohen does not hold back. Although a few moments brought these dangers to life, the sheer amount of stereotyping and middle school humor made the film downright unwatchable. Why are we so obsessed with genitalia?In this subsequent moviefilm, raw, candid ""interviews"" have been replaced by staged actors who are not very convincing. You can't tell if they're acting bad on purpose or if the crew just rushed to hire anyone who'd help get this film out prior to the election. The editing job is atrocious as well. Most of the scenes are polished and scripted, but other ""raw"" bits are seemingly slapped on at random, often in a misleading way. I won't give away spoilers, though.Maria Bakalova probably saved this from being a complete dumpster fire. Even though she babbles incoherently at times, there were glimpses of great acting and potential from a few of her scenes. Unfortunately, her character is written in such a way that it's unclear which way she is evolving. I'll blame the writers, because when she was able to deliver, she gave me reason to keep watching.Overall, I did not laugh out loud once in this film. I gave it a shot from start to finish, but there are only so many dick pics, ""vagine"" references and Jewish ""jokes"" I can take in one sitting.

Getting a fax machine employee to send stupid messages where the guy is clearly smirking at this was just not funny. The Trump hate was clearly in line with the host of late night talk shows and very mundane and repetitive. We get it the media hates him and would rather have you vote for anyone else.

For example, the dance scene at the ball was genuine, Michael Pence, the scene with Trump's lawyer, as well as the song at the rally.Some say the ending was rushed, but in my opinion, the ending tied the movie's plot VERY NICEly together. I had a hard time believing that Khazakhstan's president would send Borat on a mission as ridiculous as delivering a gift to Trump's second in line, just to get in the ""big boys club"".

They all come from a farm community and believe far out conspiracies. I wont mention the obsession that democrats have with the Russian conspiracies, because Sasha didn't.Worst of all about the movie is that the funniest parts about the first Borat movie was the interviews.

While still keeping it's comedy and mockumentary feel, it does so in a much smaller state, giving more attention to the dromedy aspect of the movie.It is great direct social commentary on many things, from the pandemic to anti-Semitism, but it doesn't shy away from comedic timing, even in it's most serious times. The breakout star Maria Bakalova and the return of Sacha Baron Cohen brings us a father-daughter duo with a chemistry never seen before. The rest of the ""cast"" brings us many different characters, from the plastic surgeon who admitted he would sexually assault a young woman to the babysitter who cared for Tutar enough to convince her to seek her own individuality.Being nominated for two Oscars and already winning a plethora of awards shows how much you can accomplish with great and impactful comedy, given the fact that this is Ms. Bakalova's first major role and Mr. Cohen's second movie of the past year, with both being nominated (the latter x2).10/10",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm
739,alexbozic-58933,Nobody will really like this for what it is.,3,26 October 2020,"The real truth about the Borat Subsequent Moviefilm is that nobody will like it or hate it for what it is.
The people who like this movie will like it because it has ridiculed the politics that they don't support, and therefore they'll find it amusing.
On the other hand, the people who don't like this movie won't like it because it ridicules the politics that they support, and therefore they'll be offended.
However, this was not the case with the first film, which was universally liked by all sides of political spectrum because it has ridiculed every political idea there is. That is not the case with this film, but it's also the least of it's issues.Borat Subsequent Moviefilm is a complete letdown (compared to the first one) on (almost) every single level. It's pacing is completely off, the humour feels faked and staged, acting is far worse than it's been in the last film, Cohen is lacking in charisma and the overall writing is sloppy. The film is an overall disappointment.
However, most people won't notice it (or will notice it but won't care), as they'll be too busy being amused or offended, but nobody will like this movie for what it is. The only reason to like this movie is not because of it's quality as a movie, but because of it's political message, and the only reason to hate this movie is not because of it's low quality as a movie, but because of it's political message.
Overall, Borat Subsequent Moviefilm (quality wise) won't be liked by anyone (not in a real sense at least) and it will stay a cinematic disappointment compared to the first movie.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

I was wrong. This is some of Sacha's best work, and the climax of the movie (no spoilers) is absolutely jaw dropping.I give it an 8-9 only because it didn't have as much of the narrative + real world blending, a lot more of it was scripted than the original. That isn't to say that this makes it boring, just that obviously Sacha is at his best during real world scenes. I must also acknowledge that many people have reviewed this quite low most likely because of political leanings, but even I, who consider myself more right leaning found this to be a completely transparent and truthful look at the sad state of America.Everyone has prime so I see no reason anyone shouldn't watch this.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

It is difficult to imagine a better, more hilarious, and yet terrifying take at today's United States. Until you reach the end, you cannot take your eyes off the screen, and as it comes to an end, you are left with one question, ""What the hell was that!!!"" Well, that was racist, that was sexist, offensive, that was bad, but none of that matters, because that was Borat! If you want to watch this subsequent moviefilm, first throw all your expectations and all your understanding about filmmaking out of the window. Only then you can grasp how in all its vulgarity, in all its pointlessness it exposes the terrifying reality. And yes, it is a terrifying reality indeed. The sequel is way more scripted then the original movie, which was surprising, but perhaps necessary. As Borat himself puts, ""People make recognize my face"". That scene with Rudy Giuliani -- I would not spoil anything but would just say that the world needs more filmmakers like Cohen and fewer politicians like Giuliani. Mara Bakalova is another awesome gift of this movie, hope to see her appearing in more challenging roles in the future.

The second one.
It just applies to Americans. Good thing I watched it through a trial and not on a subscription as it was not worth it at all.
There were exactly 4 times I laughed at this movie. The most at the Jewish part in the church(But also only the beginning) and the very end when they're reporting.
This was such an American propaganda it was painful for me to watch.

You guys should have just stuck to spoofing people instead of the ""orange man bad"" default crutch everyone falls back on when they run out of ideas. That is what made the original such a great film, little if any political agenda. This film just felt very lazy.

At first I was surprised that I was not liking the film at all, I asked myself, Have i changed? has he changed ? has the world changed? The ridiculous sex scenes, the obscene jokes, I began thinking that perhaps I just was not into it anymore,14 years had passed after all and in those days only my inner circle of friends managed to understand and love the film, it has always been a niche, the moment one character mentions the cellphones and how is everybody holding one was when it finally hit me how much time had really passed, 'oh yeah we really did use cellphones that much back then"" maybe I had grown old and grumpy and wouldn't like this movie at all. 30 minutes in and all my doubts had been removed.
THE CRINGE
That sensation that only this man knows how to produce in all its glory, luckily for me the online format allowed me to pause the film for moments to catch my breath, laugh a little and remember the good old days when this was fresh a new, many new things have appeared and therefore Borat needed adaptation, the interviews were out of the question for the simple fact that nobody would fall for that... so what can you do if you are Sacha Baron Cohen , when your main weapon is no longer usable? I give this rating based on the cleverness of the producers and writers to make this things work taking the circumstances into account, this film is better than the original, but it is not Fresh and fights with one hand tied to its back, in conclusion this film is not revolutionary like the first one, it is not timeless like the original, but it is true to its spirit and to the artist.

I never really laughed uncontrollably like a really funny normally will make me do... but I did chuckle out of amusement quite a bit and for that I enjoyed it regardless of whether it was genuinely funny or not. It also appeared to be quite scripted and the ending where his daughter turns Kazakhstan into a feminist country was a bit awkward and it wasn't until that moment I felt like there was some kind of political agenda behind this movie, despite it obviously pushing a female focused lead actress into the forefront in a movie about a woman finding her own power etc... it in a way, was done really well for the sort of social justice/feminist/leftist theme this movie was clearly trying to go for.All in all, if you just want to be entertained by a new Borat character that is every bit as worthy as Borat himself, you should watch this.

REAL REVIEW.,10,30 October 2020,"My husband loved SCB in all his incarnations (Ali G., Borat, Bruno, and that guy from Who is America). He'd quote parts of Bruno (""But first, more dancing with Bruno!"") as he'd dance around me in the kitchen. He'd quote parts of an interview SCB did with Dick Cheney, as I rolled my eyes. Every couple of years or so, he'd put on Bruno or Borat, and laugh, and laugh, while I just shook my head. In short, he reverted from a mature 35 year old man, into a a teen, because of this one comedian. I kind of hated it and really didn't see the appeal of Cohen's comedy which I found crude and sometimes downright offensive (i.e., ""In my country, they would go crazy for these two. That one, not so much.""). Until this Borat 2020 film, that is.Knowing he was such a fan, the evening of the day the film came out, I grilled him a porterhouse steak in bourbon and pecans, with a baked potato smothered in broccoli and cheese sauce, and relegated myself to sit through this new Borat without looking too bored or condescending.Two things happened.One, my husband, laughed several times, of course, but he did so less heartily than he had at most of SCB's prior work, and he never rewinded it to re-watch an especially funny part.Two, I loved it.This Borat film is hilarious!!! And not only is it both, in your face, and subtly hilarious, but it has sooo much heart, it nearly brought me to tears. Even the infinitely ill-informed guys he quarantined with, made me want to go out and hug a redneck.So, if you're here wondering whether you should watch it (although I don't think that's what anyone does anymore), I suggest you do so. The worst that can happen is that you'll laugh. Since when is that a bad thing? The best that can happen is that you'll laugh and cry at seeing the United States in such a dire and chaotic state, and so far from united, that you will walk away with a desire to one day make it united, as the greatest gift ever to ourselves and our kids.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

Still lots of laugh out loud moments and a couple of very potent cringe scenes.

I get it, there are parts of this country that don't share the same views as the coasts. Some are downright scary when looked at with an evolved sense of humanity. But, to search them out and use them as a representation of a whole party is just flat wrong. You can do this for any group. I wish this movie was more fair and less focused on our politics here.

I am a big fan of first Borat but this one ruined my good memories from the first movie.
The main reason was that, the story of some one strange with American culture was already spoiled with first Borat, in fact Borat 2 was a fade version of the first one.
Also I believe the character of Borat's daughter wasn't a cool partner for Borat. In first Borat his colleague (Azamat) was an ideal character to complete Borat's character while the lack of this supporting character was obvious in the second.

Irrespective he has largely subverted his views and let the comedy speak for itself. With the exception of a handful of laughs I found it depressingly obvious where he was headed. For all those not old enough to have watched Da Ali G Show on Channel 4 in the UK it was a surprising mix of both highbrow and lowbrow comedy loaded into a tightly spoken paraphrase. He didn't care who he made fun off it crossed all political and non political boundaries. Now unfortunately I think he is only happy to be politically incorrect when it validates his political correctness to left leaning audiences.

I honestly it holds up decently compared to the first one, sure it has a lot more scripted scene and the storyline is more coherent, but the fact that SBC can still get those kind of reactions out of people years after he reached worldwide fame is honestly jawdropping.

I'm sure the bad reviews here are from people that think their ideas are the supreme truth.

860,justino1996,"Wonderful setups, disappointing execution",5,25 October 2020,"The original Borat struck the world at the PERFECT time. A time when certain topics deserved to be questioned and satirized when they commonly weren't. Borat was a breath of fresh-woke-air. Sadly, 16 years later, Borat Subsequent Movie Film marginally fails to match the payoff of its culturally classic original. Every joke is based upon political/social satire, just like the original, but never once goes over the realm of being anything funnier than something you saw on College Humor or SNL four years ago. Every joke is there waiting to be told, but never attempts to be anything more than a ""that's funny"" comment. The film feels incredibly safe when it should have let itself let loose and stir the pot like it did almost two decades ago. A lot of this can be related to the lives we live now where politics have become hyper saturated and aggressive to the point where nothing makes us ""surprised"" anymore. I can't let that excuse the new Borat, but I think it may have been a roadblock that is impossible to to hurtle in this political climate. To more technical faults, the director clearly did not have a sense of classical comedic pacing; every joke is a mile a minute, not unlike a new episode of family guy. We never get the chance to examine Borat's reactions to the cultural divide that made his first outing so charming but realizing. This is a film that would have greatly, and I mean greatly, come to excellent realization as a multi-part series not unlike modern streaming-only documentaries. I feel this would have been the true home of the beloved Borat Sagdiyev.

American's unwavering commitment to be polite, to mind their own, to show respect to foreigners who they have a business transaction with... We want them to say, ""how dare you?"" or ""you can't do that!"", but they are set up to believe that the people being filmed are important to some foreign country, and they want to be respectful on camera, and make their money to get by... Even at the Republican Women's meeting, though some women were fuming, they were respectful and championed the daughter to have a voice, which was admirable, even if I disagree with their fundamental world view. This is then juxtaposed with the hate and misogyny: how abortion is wrong no matter what the circumstances, how men and women would sell off a woman or take advantage of a woman at any point, the hate for other people, other countries... but, everyone has rights, which they are disappointed in but stick by.
So, if one was to walk away from this and go, it's just an attack on Republicans or Americans et al, I would say they have missed that it's actually against hate for others and against the misogynistic treatment of women at all levels in society, and not just in America, but it's mostly fighting against men who have done the wrong thing by women and their country.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

Not to mention the whole idea is to comfort all those who feel ""lost"" in these uncertain and unfamiliar times. Borat, once again, reminds us that once we stop caring about the societies overwhelming idiosyncrasies, we can all live in social harmony. Yes, i will admit some of the themes felt...forced. Being where we are as a race, i still believe this is a very strong and relevant work of art. Absolutely hilarious.

874,datrax,"Not as funny as Borat, but worth a watch",6,25 October 2020,"Unfortunately nothing like the first film, aside from the central hi-jinks surrounding the Borat character, which is the main strong point that delivers the most laughs. Whereas the first centered around making the unwilling subjects react in stranger than fiction ways, here much of the ""docu-comedy"" action is or appears to be scripted, and there's a rather drawn out boring middle section weighed down by this, where you only really keep watching for the central ""plot"" and comedy of Borat's ""mission"". It's unavoidable that the character is now too well-known to get away with the stunts of the original Borat, but it nonetheless weighs the comedy down a fair bit and feels rather hollow at times. As does the ham-fisted hit-and-miss propaganda-comedy moments of.. dressing up in a ""Trumpsuit"" to crash a GOP Pence talk that falls rather flat, and a curious bit with Guiliani that is nothing like the headlines it garnered and seems designed more to sway votes than deliver comedy; without spoiling too much, as there's little to nothing to spoil; one of the characters pretends to be a reporter who tries to seduce Giuliani and appears to succeed, proving what would come as little shock to most, that most powerful people won't say no to sleeping with an attractive journalist if given the chance, but the whole entrapment joke is rather ruined when Borat burst in at the moment suprème to try and get some clickbait headlines out of the whole ordeal, ruining whatever slight comedic value it presented. And given Guiliani was actually re-iterating stuff in the interview I rather agree with without being a Republican, it all felt like a rather stunted political prank that was neither daring nor really that interesting, and rather begs the question if the whole film weren't commissioned by the Biden camp in some form. Which, aside from dialing down the comedic value yet some more, just doesn't deliver much in the way of Borat-style comedy we've seen so far. Nonetheless it's worth a watch, and the first 15 minutes are immediately very funny, I recommend to watch it for the SBC character comedy alone and not expect too much in the way of classic Borat semi-improvisational comedy, because I'm hard-pressed to remember any segment that either wasn't or didn't feel like it was entirely scripted with actors pretending to be clerks or barbershop customers or a plastic surgery clinic. Luckily it's somewhat made up for by the character comedy, but it only manages to reach the heights of the original, or The Dictator, on a few occasions. Still worth watching. 6/10",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

Knowing that, Cohen tries to make up for it by focusing on a few bigger scenarios involving people in power unknowingly starring in the movie.I personally had a blast watching the spectacle unfold with the Borat character along with how the story weaves in current events in hilarious ways. The movie also has a much harder political edge than the first movie, which will make it a hard sell for some. It's still more than worth the watch.

A product of its' time, the film takes what are now familiar themes of Sasha Baron Cohen and incorporates them into Borat's familiar idiom. He takes you on long journey that ends in the present day with stops along the way to embarrass people left and right. He shows how strange our country has become and yet, it's a familiar kind of strange. The plot is very clever. How he pulled such an amazing series of events together is baffling. They must have had to constantly adapt to new circumstances until they got the results that made the most sense. Oh, and it's easily the funniest movie I've seen in many years. Maybe since the first Borat. I recommend it for the laughs even if you don't agree with the sentiments. It's that funny ...",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

Its hard to fool people like Sacha and yet he still succeeds in many hilarious ways. Borats daughter Tutar is alot of fun, I laughed way to many times and her acting is brilliant. SHE FOOLED RUDY FFS AND almost got away with it. So it became ""extra"" brilliant to not just laugh at Sacha, but to her aswell with hilarious punch lines and good executed comments togheter with her father.I can't help it to feel bad for all the people in this movie tho. Im not from America so I can't comment on their political status (more than I've read from the news in Sweden). But still I guess they got what they deserved. For me watching the movie from another country without any knowledge about America was a joyfull but frightening experience. Especially the scenes with Judith the jew. I heard that she passed away (may she rest in piece) and that her daughter actually sued Sacha for making the film and was demanding that they removed the scene with her from the movie. I understand that to 100% but still. Probably the most beautiful part of the movie that Judith actually accepted Borat for being a jerk, giving him a hug and saying the word ""hope"".I truly think this is a masterpiece in all ways. You can seperate the scenes from reality and still stay very close to the content of this film. What an absolute blast it was but I must admit, many of the scenes where very very very immature. Like the sequence at the prom/ball with all the daughter and fathers. I wish I could see the aftermath from that building but it skipped to the next part directly. It portayed America and the Donald Trump followers like complete idiots but still with balls of still managed to live among them and speak to them as they respected Borat.GREAT ACTING - VERY VERY FUNNY - SACHA EXPOSED EVIL TO THE TRUTH - MADE AMERICA LOOK STUPID AGAIN*CHENGUI Sacha, I sincerelly hope that I will meet you someday.^thank you???",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

This movie feels more like watching an SNL member do a terrible impression of Borat than it feels like Borat himself. At least with the former there can be some humor residing in the satire of it all.

But now The Second one wasn't at least A Comedy ! I only liked to laugh at the first 20 mins and last 5 mins; The other parts was kind of Drama Or something like that. And also it wasn't like that Document-Style the first movie had. The Second movie had Some targets and some messages which wanted to give to The audience but those messages is kinda ""Too Much Bold"" and hadn't the cleverness of First Movie.
I liked it, But just For watch it only once. Of Course I won't recommend anyone to watch it and I would suggest They Make Their Love With The 2006's movie.

953,ignatdanilchuk,Borat is back,6,23 October 2020,"Sasha Baron Cohen returned to his beloved role of Borat Sagdiyev, once the already recognizable Kazakh journalist finds himself in the realities of the USA in 2020. Pandemic, rallies and the election race, all of this is somehow involved in the plot. This time Borat is not acting alone, his daughter Tutar (Maria Bakalova) helps him in this. Tutar Sagdieva is a fifteen-year-old girl who is an exact copy of her father, she knows neither morality nor mores. She perfectly complements Borat as a character and develops him.In comparison with the first film, the jokes did not become sharper, and the toilet humor did not diminish, but fourteen years have passed since the release of the first film about Borat. During this time, the world has changed, and we have changed after it. The film makes fun of feminism, anti-Semitism and the foundations of society. Considering today's tolerant society, Borat 2 looks very brave.
It's amazing to see how Baron Cohen comes closer and closer to the destruction of the fourth wall throughout the film and indicates his intentions in the material itself.Fourteen years after the release of the first Borat film, it was difficult to choose a better time for such a burning and important message. The film gives us new reasons to fear the world, but it also gives us the opportunity to laugh at them.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

I was thinking surely someone in such a powerful position can not be that dumb to be compromised by pranksters and get caught red handed.Some people are saying it's fake but even Rudy didn't deny it wasn't him.The only part that was scripted was when Borat was talking to holocaust survivors.,Borat Subsequent Moviefilm
966,dylanmoogatt-28263,Anybody in power should fear Sacha Baron Cohen,10,23 October 2020,"Let's start by saying that Cohen has been notorious for pointing out political and social problems in society with most of the films he has been attributed to.Borat Subsequent Moviefilm is no different.His penchant for trolling not only the general public but those in power in this movie is on a whole other level to anything he has done in the past.If you were a fan of the original 2006 Borat film, don't expect something exactly the same. This movie felt more refined with less filler and feels much more relevant to the things we are going through today from politics to COVID to human rights and equality.There will be those who say ""this is a stupid film"" based on face value. However, when you break it down to what Cohen tried to do all you can do afterwards is just picture how stupid some of the people in this movie are going to (and already do) feel *cough* Rudolph Giuliana *cough* and you'll understand exactly why nobody can match Sacha Baron Cohen in the art of making people look incredibly stupid.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm
967,nightcrawler-41342,Brilliant Movie!!,10,23 October 2020,I have never laughed so hard.Cohen went after them all: countries that see women as second hand citizens and who's only purpose is to obey. He portrayed Melania as a ''lucky one'' for living in a gold cage rather than in a normal one. I think Giuliani was under the impression he is going to get lucky. Kind of reminded me of ''The Limo '' episode in Seinfeld where George was close to getting lucky to a nazi simpathiser. The Facebook touch was also brilliant as more and more people believe stories on their Facebook feed which could really be written by anyone who wants to have a laugh at the expense of gullible people. If you don't allready have prime get it and watch this movie. Nobody portraits the tragic reality we live in better than Borat!,Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

969,IvankaDumpsalot,Wow. Some people don't understand what satire is.,10,23 October 2020,"Kind of disappointing to read conservatives' ratings just calling the film juvenile and not funny. Did they just not get it? This is satire, and since there appears to be confusion somehow: Cohen does not hate Jews or women, or even the Q Anon guys he lived with for 5 days. He said they were simply good, normal people who had just been fed a diet of lies. He's a good man and a funny one at that. Why are you so upset that bigotry and hate is being called out for what it is in this film?Just look no further than the current president if you want to criticize someone for being so morally bankrupt, a man who thinks he can grab women's crotches whenever he wants. It's a shame that any man would defend this twisted power trip.Giuliani is a creep, and it's on tape. Like the president, he loves women laughably younger than him, and cheating on their spouses is just second nature to them (hm... seems pretty common with politicians in general, though. Hi, Bill, hello Mr. Weiner).But I really can't understand defending this embarrassing president and trashing any movie that makes you feel like your supposed political sensibilities are offended. You know who's not offended by this film? People who don't identify as Nazis, and also people who understand what. satire. is. Borat is a character and does not reflect the actual views of Cohen... he is a vessel to expose anti-Semitism, racism, sexism, and so many things that hurt human beings.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

974,leisurefeature,Leisure Feature Review,8,23 October 2020,"Sasha Baron Cohen dusts off the grey suit for a second run as Borat Sagdiyev, fourteen years after the release of the first Borat film. If you saw the 2006 film you know what to expect, satire and social commentary turned up to 11. Cohen still employs his heavy-handed approach to making very nuanced comments on modern society, all wrapped in cringe-inducing humor. Seeing people agree with and feel emboldened by his use of stereotypes that create a safe space for bigotry and misogyny show the audience how prevalent hate still is in the world. Cohen again holds a mirror up to society and creates laughs for those already in on the truth.81/100",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

They then tried to say in interviews that only 1 scene was staged and the rest were real interactions, which makes you realise that most of the stuff they said was ""real"" in the movie was fake. It becomes the same one sided narrative we hear daily, and to poke fun of both sides is funny, but to poke fun of only one side is cowardice. Grow some stones and dare to create some proper 2 sided humour.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm
976,oliverloekke,What's needed for our time,9,23 October 2020,When I first saw the original Borat movie I thought it was amazing. This one is just equally good if not better at many points. Sascha Baron Cohen is a true artist when it comes to exsposing the true Nature of Modern society and he does it while maintaining a good and positive sense of humour. From the top politician to the well-manered family to the everyday delivery man who does not seem to be bothered by the fact that a human person is trapped within a box. He grabs the most essential problems today and showcases them in brutal but yet honest ways and he does not care. I'll guess that is what makes these movies so damn good.,Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

This guy is in a league of he's own. While a lot more of this Sequel is scripted, due to Borats high profile, these scenes are more for plot development and build up to the real scenes with the aim of people exposing themselves. For me, the three standout scenes that showcase this were; the abortion clinic, the final interview, and the ball. The daughters reaction to her father offering a large sum of money in exchange for Borat's daughter was priceless, and the fact it was so genuine made it 10x funnier.
The way the film ties in with current events but is also not constantly about covid is done extremely well and creates a great story line.
In my opinion this film is just as hillairous as the original, but just at a less frequently, but is made up for with the better plot and conclusion.A special mention to the supporting actress who seems relatively unknown, but gave an exceptional performance.

1018,kada-61986,Balkan culture: not worthy of mockery (ignorant appropriation),1,25 October 2020,"There are certain themes that the movie mocks openly and none of these are to blame for my disappointment. The Balkan culture appears in the movie on a few occasions and it seems that it is not even significant enough to be mocked at, but rather to be ignorantly used and appropriated.Starting with ""Ederlezi"", a song ingrained in Balkan traditions and usually associated with celebrations that mark the beginning of Spring, it seems that it is thrown in the opening scenes of the movie without any apparent reference to Balkan values or traditions.The second and main ignorant reference to the Balkan culture is the character portraying Borat's daughter. Throughout the whole movie, she is speaking in Bulgarian which is presented as Kazakh or Russian (not clear what their intentions were), and Borat seems to be replying mainly with some animal sounds. It would be understandable if a leitmotif in the story was the view of English-speaking countries on foreign languages, but from what I've gathered the insolent use of a language completely unrelated to the story did not seem worthy of mockery.With this movie, Sacha just shows a stand of a conformist who is only capable of joking with comfortable themes which in today's context are some really low hanging fruits.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

of the hyper-politicized atmosphere suffocating pretty much everything these days.Instead, he offers more of the same stale and thinly veiled leftist propaganda masquerading as comedy we can already find almost everywhere, somewhat akin to an R-rated Jimmy Kimmel.... yawn.At what point did this once brilliant artist cease being brave?Also, unlike his previous films, most everything in this is obviously staged with everyone on camera in on the joke, making it even less funny.Granted, Maria Bakalova added a lot to the film and there were one or two genuinely funny scenes.

1040,tdofeldt,A rushed big disappointment,2,27 October 2020,"I am a big fan of Sacha Baron Cohen's previous work as borat and Ali G. It was daring and hilarious because he exposed people in a clever way by pretending to be much dumber than he is.
However, borat 2 was not a ""great success"" according to me.As soon I saw the trailer, I was both excited but concerned about the casting of his female co star. She did not change my mind since she was came across as annoying and ruined most of the scenes she was in. Also, it seemed she aimed for the ideology, that weird faces and loud noises equals funny. Instead she made it cringe worhty and at times i even had to skip her bits talking in the movie.Sacha Baron Cohen did a better performance, although at many times, he seemed off character such as the rally gig. There were also other times like the mike pence scene where he acts completely different. Therefore, the idea of disguising a disguised person did not work out in this case. I laughed perhaps at 3 occasions throughout the movie which was only Sacha's single scenes.The scripted parts in the movie were terrible and Sacha should have focused on funny pranks instead of monotonous dialogues with Borat's daughter. At times, I felt like I was watching a movie aimed for kids. For example, the ending made was cringe worthy and the combination of vulgarity and childish script gave was terrible.Also, the one sided political aspect of this movie was disappointing. This movie will be irrelevant in five years since its main purpose seemed to focus on the election.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

1048,thedeadmanwalking-21623,Subsequent disappointment,5,30 October 2020,"The first Borat was a great film, that worked really well. The character of Borat as a cultural, zany yet ignorant foreigner, placed into an unscripted polar opposite society; provided a great springboard for the jokes and bits. The comedy had variety, with various comedic targets that allowed for differentiated hyperbolic, comedic interactions and misunderstandings from broad, timeless insights.This film disappointingly forgot all of that. Instead, choosing heavily scripted interactions and timestamped, 'safe' and predictable pop-cultural-political references. Politics has a place in comedy as it does in all art, but comedy pivots on insights and perspectives. Drawing them from a single - played out demographic like this film does, leaves you with a repetitive, flavorless and forgettable product. They obviously focused their writing efforts more on creating a narrative, but sadly it's mediocre at best (11 writer credits, btw).The overall comedy could have worked if the general interactions were less scripted and more genuine. There are a few big bits in the film that were genuine attempts, though they were failures with moderate deceptive editing to cover them up a little (and were spoiled by the trailer). The skits throughout the film relying on shock humor that play on Borat as a cultural outsider, likewise don't work because they're too scripted and chessily written; instead of feeling organic and unpredictable from improvisational comedy.Though disappointing, to produce and release a film during a global pandemic is an achievement nonetheless. Additional praise should also go to Maria Bakalova for a standout performance, which hopefully jumpstarts a more fruitful career for her. Overall, unless you're bored for an hour and a bit, watch something else.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm
1049,gionniblas,"Bold, hilarious and thought-provoking",10,8 November 2020,"Having watched all of Sacha's previous work, I knew exactly what to expect, yet this film still managed to surprise me from beginning to end.
It is absurdly funny. 15 minutes in, my whole body already hurt from laughter!This film takes a clear stand on political matters - much like the TV mini-series ""Who Is America?"" - which has angered many Conservative viewers. I suspect this to be the reason why the movie is being massively underrated. In my opinion, it was the boldest, most relevant move Cohen could have made in the current political climate, and he didn't disappoint.A brilliant addition to the second installment of ""Borat"" is actor Maria Bakalova, who incredibly matches Sacha in energy, acting skills and dedication to her part.
The unfair treatment of minority groups, right-wing political extremism and conspiracy theories are the main themes of discussion in Borat's Subsequent Moviefilm, all linked by a surprisingly emotional plot that dives into Borat's relationship with his daughter Tutar (played by Bakalova).In the midst of a pandemic, the creatives and crew involved managed to deliver us a heartfelt, politically critical, hilarious, poetic and well-executed piece with the power to make people question their behavior and challege authoritarian figures in real-life.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

I was disappointed in the humor quality and overall takeaway value of Borat 1-- I felt unsatisfied and like it didn't live up to the hype and its status as a cultural phenomenon. However, one of my coworkers raved about Borat 2 so I decided to give it a try.The humor and controversial/provocative gags are so much more refined, precise, and developed in the sequel. I laughed a handful of times during Borat 1, but Borat 2 elicited maybe 20x more laughs from me during its runtime. The satirical social commentary of Borat 2 has a palpable sharpness to it that feels duller in Borat 1. One gets the sense that Sacha Baron Cohen's early work in Borat 1 set the stage for him to really shine and accomplish his conceptual goals in Borat 2.Borat Subsequent Moviefilm absolutely reads as social performance art intended to expose hidden aspects of the public psyche. I am actually a little pissed that the movie is free on Amazon Prime because I want to give money to everyone who contributed their hard work to make this movie happen. I just created an IMDb account maybe 30 minutes ago for the sole purpose of giving this movie the rating and review that it deserves. I am sincerely beyond impressed, and the style and substance of Borat Subsequent Moviefilm absolutely has the potential to influence future cultural commentary in art and film, not least for its contemporary inclusion/discussion of Coronavirus.I can't recommend it enough. It is undeniable that everyone involved in its production had a heartfelt vision for the film, and it was incredibly successful in communicating its social message.

This was a lot more scripted than the other films, making it ultimately less memorable and impactful, but the line being blurred between fact and fiction - the notion that the world is truly stranger than fiction - is pretty effective. There were a lot of shoehorned callbacks to the first film that really didn't work for me, and the commentary is much less subtle, but overall, I enjoyed it. If this interests you, I suggest you watch it as soon as possible - I don't know how well this film is going to hold up in fourteen years.

The Borat characther is rushed and it lacks geninue social interactions and awkward situations. The jokes seem all scrippted and not witful.Sometimes they are plain vulgar, with no other substance.

1099,jonathanakcay,GREAT SUCCESS,9,25 October 2020,"Let's be honest, when the movie was first announced it was exciting to hear that Borat was returning on the big screen. The first movie was a near-perfect comedy that, to this day, has you laughing from beginning to end. How could a sequel even come close to that standard when damn near everyone knows who Borat the character is? After laughing my ass off for an hour and a half it's safe to say that Borat is back and better than ever. Cohen's ability as both an actor and a comedian shine brightest when he's exposing political and social climates. His ability to stay in character and push people's buttons to the max is remarkable, let alone the comedic elements of making fun of various groups. Look, I don't think anyone was expecting this movie to be nearly as funny as the first, that's why I have to give this movie a 9 if the original Borat is a 10 (in terms of sheer comedy).The first one is still funnier, maybe because I've grown up with it, but this movie is right behind it. Cohen deserves so much credit for making a movie this funny in the limited time it took them to film. In this day and age when genuinely funny comedies are as rare to find as gold this movie is a diamond. I can't remember the last comedy I watched that had me laughing like this throughout the movie. Yes, there are some ""just ok"" jokes, more-so than the original had, but I laughed just as hard during this movie as the original. If nothing else Borat related was ever released by Cohen after this I'd be completely satisfied.This movie surpassed expectations and Bulgarian actress Maria Bakalova deserves tremendous credit for her performance as Borat's daughter who has arguably funnier scenes than Borat does.Amazing movie, would be a 10/10 if the original Borat never existed.Chenqui",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

1104,vegard1989,"Dishonest, mean and yet boring movie",2,26 October 2020,"I think no one should stoop to such a low level of making a movie like this. It's a scripted and professionally filmed movie that supports a few scenes designed to shock you and 'uncover' something about others.
In reality, what happens is that Borat exploits other people's friendliness, openness and patience while insulting them with pubertal humor, having a camera crew in the bushes hoping for an improper reaction.
He does tricks from his older content, such as showing up and identifying with a group of people,appearing foreign and well-meaning, but then twisting the content more and more towards very inappropriate. It was funny back then, but this time around almost no one got fooled or reacted to any of his jokes, even though he tried harder and harder to shock. And when making something like a self proclaimed political commentary, with interviews of real people in a false context, I don't think this is an okay way of doing it. The 'shocking' scene at the end was a beautiful woman talking about how starstruck she was, flirting with that Rudy guy, then pulling him into a bedroom. Then Borat comes in yelling that she was 15, when in fact she was 24, playing a serious adult role of reporter, nothing like the more childish daughter role of earlier in the movie. Like some episode of how to catch a predator. There wasn't anything revealed there even. I don't know, I think it's tasteless and whatever story they are trying to serve it's viewers I think most would find it counter-productive to that.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

In the last movie I felt i comfy and shocked by the things people sad but I wasn't completely thrown aback. The faces we see and recognize in this wonderful concoction of modern fear are haunting. It's not just an innocent bystander. It's topical and it's brutally raw. Sadly it is a little one sided at points, which doesn't make for a thorough watch if you are looking to feel like everyone is getting it handed to them.

1128,jamesthompson2008,Great follow up to the first film!,10,23 October 2020,"Sequels never fare too well and beating the original without being too repetitive must have been a huge challenge but the addition to Borats story and the star of the show is the extremely likeable Daughter Tutar: Maria Bakalova is fantastic and she carrys the Sagdiyev baton and racing to the finish line with it.There are the usual staged pieces, plot devices and setups here, though surprisingly not as much as people might believe but this time the story is stronger than it was before and scenes don't feel too forced or dragged on for too long leaving to the inevitable cringe overload.The dedication to the Borat character is still real as ever and although its not always possible to have SBC in the Borat character - for example when he is in various disguises he did sometimes slip up and drop his accent in favour of a more American one - which for Borat shouldn't seem plausible or true to form but it never felt like it got in the way too much of the plot as long as it was for the sake of fooling the right people.The bits where he is in character though are fantastic and the scripting, editing and camera work feels more like a proper film this time round and ends up doing it even more justice so much that you often forget that it's candid. I often forgot all about the cameras which both amazes and stuns you when you do realise just how clever it was to setup and to produce.Some might find this less intense or filled with as many stunts as the original and with it being more plot driven, people might feel that it's taking time away from Borats usual escapades but the story is what makes the difference this time along with the little touches and shows of emotion.The mix of those and these little moments of crazyness of reality are what gel this film together as a well rounded if not slightly cut short SBC masterpiece.Oh and it's hilarious.

Its important to recognize that to a degree this was or attempted to be a political commentary and as one it fell flat. The 3 major spots it hit on were 1. the pence/cpac scene. Opening is funny but the disdane and disgust on the face of pence showed it was an inappropriate and mistimed joke. 2. on the list is the rights rally and it stands to say in my research i found that there is actually a very large amount from that scene that didnt make it in the film. And finally 3. guiliani (its spelled wrong) unfortunately this scene is not a satire scene. Telling, disheartening and most of all disgusting but belongs more as a scandal and catch a creep than in a satire film.Now the good stuff. Despite politics the movie actually gives a lot of hope in the people of this country. The biggest part for me was the synagogue scene with the old lady. To have such a genuinely nice lady like that. She took cohen's character at face value and was nothing but polite and nice and even fed him. The same sentiment was felt with the 2 men who took him in during quarantine. Political opinions aside the reality is they took him in of their own free will and volition and helped out a person who needed a place to stay.In short when the research is done on the film it is even more heart warming to see some of the things in the film.

But for every sequel that has hit... five others have flopped. Who could forget the cinematic travesties that were Jaws: The Revenge, Paul Blart Mall Cop 2, and Troll 2. This scared me.You see, I loved the original Borat. It was one of my favorite comedies growing up and still is to this day. I did not want to see this films legacy tarnished by a corporate cash grab! For surely that must be what this sequel was... right?Wrong. Borat Subsequent Moviefilm was the hardest I've laughed at a movie all year. It managed the difficult task of staying fresh and clever without straying too far from the intent of the original. The addition of Borat's daughter, Tutar Sagdiyev, as a prominent character helps put a new and interesting angle on the hilarious yet cringeworthy situations that Borat so regularly finds himself in.This movie only bolsters the legacy of Borat and Sacha Baron Cohen and avoids the pitfalls which other follow up films so frequently fall prey to.8/10 - one of the few good things to come from 2020",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

Borat and his daughter Tutar, played brilliantly by Bulgarian actor, Maria Baklova, travel around the US and I ached with laughter watching them.....especially during the Blood Moon Dance...it was a brilliant v's up at a ridiculous way of life that still seems to persist. The willingness of the fax machine man and Bakery lady to just ""do their job"", the people at their meetings and conventions, who seem unaware of a world outside their airless bubble.....yes the world is frighteningly flat here. A lifeline of hope was the black babysitter.....who's clarity changed the films direction beautifully. Cohen always addresses anti-semitism and again the synagogue visit eloquently did the job. I also like the fact that fluent Hebrew is used as Kazak(I think) The Guilliani scene is just icing on the baby cake. Thank you Mr Cohen, many a truth said in jest!",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

1173,JonnyJohnsonIII,"Funny moments ruined by ""real people""",4,23 October 2020,"I think the charm that borat was searching for was to display a hilariously offensive character in the world and political climate of 2020. They managed to create some pretty funny scenarios for Borats character to encounter with clever writing, and great improvisation from the actors. Where the film kind of fell apart for me, was that they were trying to portray many of the scenes as if they were raw reactions and takes with ""real people"". They had scenes in department stores, health clinics, and other every day locations. Although it becomes glaringly apparent that the people Borat talks to are actors, or at least playing a part. It gives the film a feeling of inauthenticity and detracts from what I believe they are trying to do. At times the film also blurs the lines between what is clever and funny, and what is just unsettling and gross. Given the timing of this film and the US elections, it feels uninspired and rushed. Entertaining at times, but falls flat",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

1181,edwardhughes-37431,Everyone should thank Trump to inspire Sacha Baron Cohen to do Borat again!,4,23 October 2020,"This movie has an obvious political agenda and ain't afraid to hide it. The show provides the viewers an illusion of honest interactions between Borat and (supposedly) average American Republicans who appears to be oblivious to the cameras. For a movie that tries to get authentic reactions felt like it missed the bar and paid. The only people I found authentic are the doctor at the pro life clinic, the Trump supporters at the rally and all of them who got their faces blurred at the concert. ***SPOILERS**** Besides that the only authentic reaction from a person that I believe is Rudy Giuliani where Borat's daughter took advantage of Giuliani's kindness (and naivety) by pretending to be a journalist and having an interview with him. After the interview has concluded you can see Borat's daughter setting up Giuliani by pretending to help him remove the wires from his clothes. Then Borat rushes into the room saying to take him instead of his daughter insinuating that Giuliani is a creep who is willing to get in bed with an underage girl (at least to the audience with heavy and nearly perfect editing).Sure the movie is funny at times and had some good cringe worthy scenes in there. But it ain't enough to redeem it especially when there is a decisive motive behind it. Like one scene in the movies insinuates black trump supporters complementing trump on twitter of Facebook are fake and made by spammers from a third world country.

1186,ninjadh-07756,Follow up falls flat,1,11 November 2020,"Perhaps my sense of humor has evolved since 2006. Or maybe I'm just exhausted by politics and the pandemic. Could be a combination of both. Who really knows? Nevertheless this one much like ""The Dictator"" & ""Brothers Grimsby"" was a flop. The scenes in the original Borat were too many to count when inducing laughs. From getting a congressman to eat cheese made from breastmilk. To getting dialect lessons from black teenagers in Atlanta. To trying to kiss strangers on a new york subway. It was amazing comedy from start to finish. And one of my top five of all time. This go around for me was sadly a sequel which should have just remained an idea. Anti-semitism, sexism, xenophobia, menstral cycles and incest just don't seem nearly as funny 14 years later. Look, if you hate the GOP and despise Trump and his supporters then you'll probably love this movie. As the piling on is incessant and theirs plenty of fuel for anyone who's rage against Donald Trump burns mightily. But if you're indifferent and want a break from the tumultuous atmosphere that is the chaos of the United States in 2020 you'll be sorely disappointed. If anything it amplifies this exhausting year. I am all for laughing at America in spite of itself. The Kazak national anthem at the Texas rodeo in the original is one of my favorite of all of SBC's sketches. But the ridiculing of right wing supporters were hollow this time around. Most importantly, the reactions (which imo made the first film as great as it was) were also extremely mild. It felt as if SBC and Maria Bakalova were overreaching a lot. And when each shock was delivered the unease and explosive tempers never surfaced.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm
