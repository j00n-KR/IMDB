0,MartinHafer,Very deliberately paced and lovely to watch.,8,2 January 2020,"The story begins in London in 1946. Now that the war is over, Juliet Ashton is a best-selling author and she should be happy now that she's become engaged to a rich and handsome American soldier. But she seems a bit lost despite her success. One thing that piques her interest is a letter she's received from Guernsey (one of the Channel Islands off the coast of France). It's from a man who is looking for a book and who is part of the The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society...a book club consisting of about a half dozen members. Instead of just sending the man the book, she decides to go to Guernsey and meet this book club. However, although they loved hosting her, there is some sort of secret about this group...a secret that Juliet is determined to find out for herself.The biggest praise in this film probably goes to the director, as the story is simple but Mike Newell manages to make the most of it. Some lovely performances, great pacing and a lovely script all work together to tell a story that really hook you...and if you like romances, you're sure to enjoy this movie.By the way, one of the best parts about story is its setting. Few Americans know anything about Guernsey and I enjoyed learning about the German occupation of the island during the war. Very interesting.",The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society
1,TheLittleSongbird,A nicely baked pie that isn't cooked all the way through but has enough filling to make it edible,7,23 April 2018,"Saw 'The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society' as a fan of period drama, as someone who is trying to watch as many films of the year as possible and who likes a lot of the actors in the cast. It's great enough seeing such talent on their own, and even more of a delight to have so much talent together. The idea for the story was also very interesting and it was nice to see a film based in a fairly under-explored period of wartime history. The title was not hugely appetising though. Seeing the film with my sister yesterday, found 'The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society' to be a pleasant and well done if falling short of great film. It is engrossing enough and should have enough to appeal to a reasonable sized audience, it may appeal more to older audiences but those who want to know more about this period of wartime history or want to gain some knowledge of it should get something out of it.Not a perfect film by all means. Will admit to having a good idea of, well actually knowing, how 'The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society' was going to end well before it ended, with the love-related aspect of the story being telegraphed a little too early. Didn't care for the character of Mark. Despite him serving some point to the story, with a crucial part of the plot being resolved with his involvement, he was rather one-dimensional and didn't have much personality or anything to make one endear to him (he also behaves like a jerk later on). Within the period, he seemed a little out of place. The same goes for how he is played. Matthew Goode's part was also on the underwritten side but he was much easier to like.Pacing at times could have been tighter, some draggy spots here and there.However, there is an awful lot to like about 'The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society'. The production values and cast are the biggest selling points. It's a beautifully shot film with very handsomely evocative production and costume design that does give one a real sense of period.Even better are the cast, with Lily James a charming and very rootable lead and Michiel Huisman cutting a handsome presence. Their chemistry is warm and tender. Tom Courtenay is understated and amusing, having one of the film's best lines near the end, while Penelope Wilton as the most rounded supporting character is heart-wrenching. Jessica Brown Findley is also strong. Mike Newell does solidly directing, not exceptional but he skilfully stops 'The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society' from being too frothy or too intense. The script is thought-provoking, with some tension and a lot of emotion. The end credits were a lovely touch. A good job is done showing what living in the period and before was like while not being too one-sided. There is genuine emotional power here, with a back-story and main conflict, centring around the consequences of significant loss, that provides a lot of poignancy and hope. One does feel the love and friendship between the characters and there are some nice revelations along the way in solving this intriguing story where one hopes for a happy outcome to the mystery/mission dominating it. The music, when used, is neither intrusive or too low-key.In summary, good, pleasant and engaging film that could have been even better. 7/10 Bethany Cox",The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society
2,SnoopyStyle,old fashion formulaic romance,8,18 August 2018,"In 1941, the British Isle of Guernsey in the English Channel is under Nazi occupation. The locals face starvation. Elizabeth McKenna, Eben Ramsey, Amelia Maugery, Dawsey Adams, and Isola Pribby are forced to fake a literary society to hide a roasted pig when they encounter German soldiers. It's 1946 and Juliet Ashton (Lily James) is uncertain about her new wealth from the success of her book. She is not very proud of the book and she is haunted by her losses in the war. She is leery of the celebratory mood and then she gets a letter from Dawsey. She is taken with the story of their literary society. Sidney Stark is her supportive publisher. Her rich American boyfriend Mark Reynolds proposes to her and she accepts out of obligation as she leaves for the island. There she finds secrets, romance, heart-break, and a story which she cannot write.This is a traditional romantic mystery. It's a tear-jerker. It's a little darker than I expected from the quirky British title. It has all the elements of an old fashion romance which is about sacrifice and nobility. The title is problematic but I doubt the movie can escape it. The other issue is Stark. Matthew Goode is injected as a third romantic possibility which doesn't help. It's an awkward fake-out and unnecessary. His character would be better as an older father figure for Juliet. A young man would more likely be sent to war unless I missed something about his character. I don't think he's injured either. It would be better to have an older actor. The romance itself is not surprising. It is following a familiar old formula which is perfectly good. It's also nice that none of the lead characters are villains in the tale. It's a feel-good old style romance.",The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society
3,Horst_In_Translation,A film as clumsy as its title,2,12 August 2018,"The novel-based ""The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society"" is the most recent work by BAFTA-winning filmmaker Mike Newell, who is in charge of directing here, and the adaptation is by several writers (you know where you find them) and it is always a bit shocking to see so many coming up with such a mess to be honest. Anyway, first things first: Main character is played by Lily James and while her other big film this year (Mamma Mia 2) is a contender for 2018's finest, this one here is the exact opposite. I would not really blame her or the other cast members too much (more known names here too) as the film's biggest problem is the script. Let me add that I am writing this review as somebody who has not read the novel this is based on, so not sure where the problem lies exactly, but it feels like another Rosamunde Pilcher film most of the time.The key story of her being so attracted by the book club in the title feels false and just not authentic most of time. Also there seems to be a great deal of filler material in these way too long over 2 hours in my opinion. There is not one scene that really impressed me. Even if the acting is decent, like when she breaks up with the American at the end, there are other deficits in exactly these scenes like that it really all feels just to please the audience and not to feel realistic or authentic. I hoped she would stay with him to deliver in this department finally at least one bit, but it just isn't happening. It's a massive problem. And don't even get me started on the wedding proposal eventually. There was virtually nothing between these two to be fair. Her reading was just as bad and how she is accepted by everybody all of a sudden afterwards after the initially critical reactions, especially by the older lady, and well her final comment about tearing up is hardly funny or likable at all. Same for the death of the other central female character who we only meet in flashbacks. Nothing feels right here. I literally never had the impression that I was watching actual people and not people pretending to be somebody else and yes like I said I would not blame the actors, but the weak writing, especially when it comes to dialogues. Also quite a shame to see a really talented actor like Matthew Goode wasted like this. What was with his gay-themed story line and him acting straight towards the main character anyway? Very weird.Going back to the beginning and the title, it needs to be said that the way it was created felt just as bizarre as these scenes with the actual potato peel pie and how everybody finds it funny how disgusting it is. Yeah well, I could be talking about a dozen other scenes as well now, but I think you are getting my approach by now already. I think you must really like cheesy films based on English literature to see any value in this one here. If you don't, then do yourself a favor and skip the watch. I also wish I could unsee it and I was really mostly wasting my time there. Huge disappointment this movie and I am baffled by the rating and reception. No good.",The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society

5,CinemaSerf,Mick Newell has something to be well proud of.,7,9 April 2020,"Well, it isn't a title you will ever forget, is it? Lily James (""Juliet"") had been writing to the eponymous society to find out about their island's experiences under Nazi occupation during WWII. She hits on the idea of writing a book about it so sets off from London to visit and dig deeper. The tale is delivered by way of letters and thus you are gradually drawn into a detailed, engaging and really charming story. It isn't so much about the wartime, though there are some very poignant threads to the film that are - it's about personalities; and pretty much the whole gamut of them at that. It's a bit of a love story - both between people and between ""Juliet"" and the islanders themselves; even the more curmudgeonly ones! The high quality of the production and dialogue reminded me a little of ""Quartet"" - Sir Tom Courtenay; Dame Penelope Wilton and Jessica Brown Findlay turn in excellent, but understated and delicate performances - as does Michael Huisman. Expect a few twists and turns but nothing to stem that feeling of warmth you are left with at the end.",The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society
6,writers_reign,Paella In The Cellar,6,20 April 2018,"Fairly painless romp confirming that there is still mileage to be extracted out of the second German war. Given the fact that they were invaded and occupied and their proximity to mainland Britain it's surprising that the Channel islands haven't featured to any great extent in war films and certainly not in dramatic storylines of world war two, in fact offhand I can think only of Appointment With Venus prior to this and that was definitely a comedy built around the eponymous Venus who happened to be a cow. Despite David Niven and Glyniis Johns it sank without trace and one wishes a better fate for the Guernsey Literacy Society.",The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society
7,neil-476,Satisfying,8,5 May 2018,"In 1946, newly successful author Juliet follows up correspondence to investigate the curiously named Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, created during the German occupation of the Channel Islands. But behind the story of the Society lies another story...Lily James plays Juliet in this gentle but thoughtful period drama. A well-rounded cast all play well, with Penelope Wilton excelling as a woman overflowing with a variety of hurts.I don't want to say more: rather I would encourage people to see a film which kept me wondering about the answers to questions raised as the film went on.It is beautifully filmed in locations which one would like to think are authentic, even though they are not.",The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society
8,malcolmgsw,Overlong drama,5,20 April 2018,Having been to Geurnsey only a few years ago I guessed that much of what was shown wasn't filmed there.This was a combination mystery and old fashioned transfer with an appropriate ending.Whilst not without its merits i felt that this was at least thirty minutes too long.That and the title is not likely to entice many people to watch it.Indeed i was just one of three people in the audience.,The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society
9,siderite,"A rather interesting premise, but something off in the presentation",7,15 August 2018,"A young Londoner writer finds an interesting set of people on the island of Guernsey who share some personal stories from the time of the German occupation. Somehow they are all linked by the pleasure of reading books, after they were inadvertently forced to create a book club to justify their meetings during the Nazi regime. But after the initial groan ""Oh, no, not another war movie"", it was clear that the action was happening right after the end of War World II. And it was interesting, in a literary way (especially since I had tried to watch Book Club just before and I gave it up) as well as a personal exploration of complex characters and it was generally well acted. However, there was always something slightly off: inadvertences, forced scenes, a romantic subplot that actually made no sense or brought any value to the film. So with much regret, I have to blame the director of the movie and a little bit the script. I don't think the lead actress was very good either, but I have to be picky to blame her for the feeling of uncanny valley while watching the film. If it weren't for this, I would have rated it a lot higher.",The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society

Not since the immaculate 84 Charing Cross Road has a film been so enamored w/the act of reading (you hear that you millennials!). During the reconstruction period in England after WWII, an up & coming writer receives a letter asking for a copy of a tome which a book club wants. We find out the club was formed when Nazis occupied the Isle of Guernsey & the inhabitants were under curfew so when a few are caught after hours the quick thinking members said they lost track of time due to their club's meeting running late. So enthralled w/the tale, the writer (played by Lily James) embarks on a mission to find out how & why this club was formed only to discover a bigger mystery in the offing.

15,jadepietro,Charming but Still Overbaked,7,5 September 2018,"GRADE: B- THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A romanticized view of WWII and British rural life.JIM'S REVIEW: The British love a good period romance story. Period.The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society fills the bill for those in need of a slightly charming tale of love and a whiff of mystery. Lots of picturesque cliffside views, fields of wildflowers and stone cottages, a bucolic setting which seems like a travelogue for a simpler way of life, the kind of rural village where Miss Marple would reside, minus the murders. There's plenty of quirky town-folks minding their manners and own business and keeping their little secrets and lies well hidden.The time is 1945, and author Juliet Ashton comes to hear of the literary group and begins to question their historic origins as inspiration for an upcoming article. This fascination leads her to the island of Guernsey where she meets the book club and its members including a handsome pig farmer in the group named Dawsey Adams. As Juliet investigates and researches her story which leads her to the German occupation five years earlier and its effect on the town, she discovers a direct correlation with the casualties of war and this reading circle of friends.Mike Newell directs his film straightforwardly, without much flair. He tends to sanitize the proceedings. Everything is a tad too clean and polished. (The pig farm seems to be spotless and idyllic; at times, I expected the cute piglets to start speaking aloud ala Babe.) In fact, nothing in the film has any period authenticity. It is all dress-up time in 40's era clothing and set design. The mystery subplot is quite predictable and vastly underplayed. The actions of some of the characters make no real sense except to advance the plot to its inevitable romantic outcome.However, he assemblies a fine cast of British actors, familiar faces from Masterpiece Theatre imports and independent British fare: Penelope Wilton (strong as always), Matthew Goode, Glen Powell, Jessica Brown Findley, Katherine Parkinson, and Tom Courtney, all good, even if the story is a trifle. Lily James and Michiel Huisman, both quite likable performers, play the misfit lovers, without much chemistry between them. (They share one of the least passionate kisses ever filmed.) Oddly, they are more convincing in their separate scenes with the other actors.Still, the film entertains throughout, although its conclusion is, pardon the pun, hogwash for the realists in us all. (Yet the romantics out there just might wallow in the film's cheap sentimentality.). While The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is never (sorry!) ""unappeeling"", it left this moviegoer expecting more. In all honesty, the title is more interesting than the film itself.",The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society
16,krocheav,Guernsey Literary & Potato Peel Pie Society - A Bygone Era,8,13 February 2019,"There's a children's book somewhere in this curious title, and as it was finished by the author's niece, Annie Barrows (who happend to be a writer of children's books) it makes me wonder if this was her Auntie's original title? Mary Ann Shaffer, sadly died before her book was published, and from comments made by those who have read her novel - the film adaption is disappointing. That said, it's highly likely those who read the book, after seeing the movie, may find the reverse. Books and screenplay adaptations can be, and are, a world apart. On its own merits, this is a highly enjoyable movie - offering fine performances, direction, wonderful locations, superior cinematography and a convincing recreation of a past era.Lead actress Lily James, is like a dream come true - she was the perfect 'Cinderella' in '15, it's easy to understand why she won that part and the accolades. This story is an account of Germany's brutal occupation of Guernsey from 1940-45, detailing its dramatic impact on a group of families and friends. It's both a sentimental romantic tale and an examination of the tragedies experienced by all individuals living under siege. From other reviewer's comments - it might seem certain modern viewers may have perhaps lost the ability to appreciate the effect these times had on long suffering participants - so some might tend to view certain aspects of this tale with a degree of cynicism. But generally, the majority of audiences should be pleased with the time they spend being entertained by this engaging story.",The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society

19,thekarmicnomad,A gentle 1940's romance,6,25 September 2018,"A female writer in the 1940's becomes fascinated by the story of a book club that was run during the German occupation of Guernsey.This is a well made film, with great engaging characters and an interesting story.The film is quite twee and reserved.
It looks at some wartime issues like collaboration, racism, loss and forgiveness.This film has to wander along a very fine line.
It is great that this story is told and not every film shot in the 1940's should be a competition of who suffered the most, but it is hard not to make comparisons and
Guernsey under the occupation cannot compare to the blood soaked streets of Stalingrad, Warsaw, Nanjing or Berlin.This is all about the characters and their experiences and their loses.
I just had trouble switching off the nagging voice in my head that prevented me sympathising with the characters' relatively quiet war.A very nice, gentle watch with some great performances.
The story is a little light but I am pleased it wasn't over sensationalised.

21,spookyrat1,Lily James Lights Up the Screen!,6,18 August 2020,"In Mike Newell's screen adaption of The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, Lily James plays author Juliet Ashton in this 1940s period drama, who exchanges letters with the residents of Guernsey, an island off the coast of Normandy that was German-occupied during World War II. To my way of thinking she is the primary reason for seeing the film. Buoyed by a reliably appealing star turn from James, this handsomely filmed production, whilst pleasant enough viewing, just seems to lack that comedic/dramatic/romantic edge to propel it further upwards towards a ""must see"" status.I haven't read the best selling novel of the same name by Mary Ann Shaffer and her niece Annie Barrows. So whilst oblivious to many of the usual complaints over what the movie should have included, or left out from the book, I will say that I feel the first act in London, appeared to drag on for too long. Well over a third of the film was done and dusted before Juliet had embarked upon her destiny-altering ferry-ride to the Channel island. And really, despite the excellent recreation of 1946 post-war London, that's where we wanted to see Juliet; on Guernsey interacting with the book club members, not spending 10 minutes waffling on at a London book launch.What we did see was really enjoyable, albeit somewhat abbreviated, much like the flashbacks involving the enigmatic Elizabeth McKenna. Call me greedy, but I wanted to see more of the charming book club meetings and renditions by its members and more of the story involving Elizabeth and the sympathetic German doctor Christian. To my way of thinking the narrative appeared unbalanced. The laughs were restrained, though the Germans occupiers never appeared onscreen, all that threatening. The developing slow-burning romance between Juliet and dishy pig farmer, Dawsey is handled well, with the scenes of Juliet, embracing farm life, with Dawsey and Kit, a highlight.The location cinematography with Devon substituting for Guernsey was exceptional (machine gun pill box and all), but it is disappointing that there was unable to be any filming done whatsoever on the island, for whatever reason. The costume and set design can only be described as first class. Watching the film really makes one feel, they're back there in the 1940's, trying to adjust back to a rustic lifestyle, interrupted for 4 years, by an occupying force.Mike Newell has directed some really fine films, on both sides of the Atlantic. Guernsey etc. whilst not up to the level of his outstanding work (Four Weddings etc. Harry Potter 4, Donnie Brasco ), is still very watchable and will appeal to those endeared to movies involving eccentric English men and women in a more serious vein than usual. It was my misfortune to see this film on commercial television, which disappointingly chose to edit out the post credits spirited book club discussion, with Tom Courtney's reading of Treasure Island, frequently cited as a highlight.",The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society
22,jrarichards,Develops from not much into a superbly-portrayed near-masterpiece,9,1 November 2019,"First a word of warning: my experience of the start of this film from British Director Mike Newell was of it looking rather trite and simplistic, even possibly as if made for children! It was surprisingly offputting, and I never expected that I would end up viewing the piece in such glowing terms. But I indeed did, and found myself both moved and elated by the quality of the work as it progressed towards its conclusion - so please stick with this, do not write it off, as your temporary forbearance will be rewarded!While the unfolding mystery plot is ultimately strong and compelling enough, my feeling would be that the movie develops as it does because of pretty-attractive filming, inspired acting giving us characters we quickly come to love; and the way it exposes a series of well-acted and meaningful relationships between people who mostly need each other because of the various traumas they have experienced and the yawning gaps that have been left in their lives as a result.The linchpin to that is the beautiful Lily James's character Juliet Ashton.However, the film is mainly 1946 Britain (and its recently liberated island of Guernsey just off the French coast), and a key - at times glaring - first contrast is between the Brits and a gung-ho, competent, well-off and keen-to-party American called Markham (Glen Powell), for whom the impressive WW2 victory is most tangible and least muted. The others (non-Americans) naturally have quieter celebrations, if any at all in the case of the specific Guernsey experience, but their needs and passions are greater.But, when Juliet gives up on her engagement with ""Mark"" - as she clearly requires something more complex and nuanced, less free of darker issues - Powell joins his fellow cast members in acting this just right, and indeed with almost painful authenticity.Writer Juliet has a superbly portrayed relationship with her gay publisher friend Sidney, and that's all credit to Matthew Goode, who is perhaps playing his ""usual role"" in some way, but who absolutely brings his warm and kindly character to life. Sidney's gay, but loves Juliet clearly and profoundly (as many of us on this side of the screen can fully understand!); and it's a touching and nuanced performance.Juliet's increasingly passionate interactions by letter and then in real life with Dawsey (Dutch actor Michiel Huisman) is also done well, with tangible chemistry on offer. But James also has a fine scene in bed (though not in THAT way) with newfound friend Isola (Katherine Parkinson); and this is also a tremendously well-acted and meaningful exchange based around strong sympathy staying just the right side of pity.It hardly needs saying that Tom Courtenay is great in his role - as postmaster and another member of the titular Society, while another beauty in the shape of Jessica Brown Findlay also does HER key (and tragic) character full justice.While I cannot claim to be a huge Penelope Wilton fan, I think it must also be said that she acts here as powerfully well as we have ever seen her do.And if all that wealth were not enough, there are also a couple of good roles for child actors, whose on-screen circumstances move us very readily indeed.Overall, the story is meaningful and strong emotionally, and the skill is first to have found a way to sum up so neatly (all aspects of) the trial the Channel Islands went through; and secondly to give us a simple cathartic medium (via books and poetry) that brings together and heals strong characters whose traumas run deep.A thought here would be that countries like Poland or even France would regard the stories on show as so entirely familiar (if still agoinising) that they come close to the typical. The skill with ""The Guernsey Society"" is the way we up the ante by this being that same kind of story within the British experience (not least because some Channel Islanders - children in particular - evacuated to Britain, while others did not). Our victory was a proud and moving one, our liberation of the chunk of our land that was occupied (inevitably, but in some sense to our shame) means yet more in that context.Ultimately, there should not be a dry eye in the house for both reasons of British patriotism, and because of the emtional reinterpretation of what the term ""family"" may come to mean, not least in the context of timeless British literary classics that shape who we are and bring us through hard times.A patriotic film them, moving, meaningful and quite beautifully portrayed.",The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society
23,Snootz,"Perhaps not the book, but...",8,7 May 2021,"This is perhaps not the book... but as I have not read the book I have nothing by which to compare. I do understand that some make movie comparisons to the book they dearly love. That is an almost guaranteed method of ruining enjoyment of a movie.A movie should be rated of its own merit, and leave the book out of it. If one enjoyed the book, so much better, for then you have both book and movie to remember. But if the movie is no more than an exact visual representation of a book, not only is it likely to be overly-long and tedious... how can a movie possibly equal or excel the power of imagination which books engage?No, movies are meant to be different, and to tell a tale of their own right. So while one may be disappointed a movie did not meet their expectations because of having prior read the book, to give it 1 or 2 stars because of that surely does injustice to a film that is by every other concept well-done. Had the book not already existed it is likely the very same people would give it high ratings for writing, directing, acting and production.When rating a movie, lay your memory of a book you have read to the side and rate the movie for a movie's sake. Does it tell a good story? Is it well-filmed and acted? Is it a *good movie*? We are not rating a book, we are rating a movie. So please, let it be rated as such, and enjoy the movie for what it has to offer. I have seen very few movies that lived up to the expectations of the book which preceded it. To expect it to do so is perhaps expecting too much from the very outset. Imagine reading a book and rating it, ""Not as good as the movie."" I don't doubt such has happened, but it does seem rather lame to compare apples and oranges.Now, if it is a bad movie by rights of a movie, by all means neg-rate away. Otherwise, rate it for what it is, not for what one wishes it would be. Or did we have nine hours to watch this movie rather than two? ; )",The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society

But they are even more powerful when you're invested in the characters.Mike Newell used only the flashback technique to unravel the story of the titular society, and there's no doubt he could have taken a riskier and more challenging way to do so. But the result is nothing short of impressive. I always wanted to know more and more about the members and their story, and I loved how I was getting minor details piece by piece like I was collecting a jigsaw puzzle. I cared about all the side characters. Thanks to the solid script, each one of these characters was so intriguing to know about.But I would that Juliet Ashton, our protagonist, is well-wrought character as much as the minor characters. Don't get me wrong, I cared about the character so much, and her romantic sub-plot and relationships in the story, but it's her background that I found unfulfilling and half-baked. We didn't get to know anything about her past, except from a very very short, and poorly-shot flashback at the beginning. But it's not just because the fact I felt it's unsatisfying that the main character lacks a well-established background, it's also because I did need that at some point in the movie. That being said, Lily James delivered a nice performance, and she was as charming as always.There are also some things that I think are a bit hard to swallow. Things like ""I don't know exactly how he, or she knew about that but let's go on anyway.""The movie looks gorgeous in general. It has a beautiful cinematography, a decent production design, and top-notch costume design that fits perfectly the movie's setting. Also, I loved the music, and it's also as traditional as the movie itself.(7.5/10)",The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society
25,tm-sheehan,"Interesting ,Entertaining and well Produced Cinema",9,31 August 2018,"IT's rare that we think of the unthinkable fact of what would have happened if Britain had been invaded by Germany in World War 2?.Well it's a fact that Guernsey was and this story tells with humour , pathos and sadness the plight of a group of citizens who become .friends under incredibly difficult circumstances, living under curfew and the barest of food to survive occupation and having to surrender to anything the Nazi occupiers wanted or face extreme punishment.The cast is fabulous with a knockout performance by Penelope Wilton, as much as I adore Dame Judy and Dame Maggie I'm so glad they didn't get the part of Amelia Maugery, a sad traumatised woman, who has lost more and sacrificed more than anyone should have to in that horrible war. We all know Penelope as Isobel Crawley in Downtown Abbey and this role is so far removed from that one .I've seen her in many other fine roles going way back to Alan Ayckbourn 's Norman Conquests in 1977 but I think this film is her finest hour.Lily James as Juliet Ashton the author who is drawn to Guernsey and the tales of these people also gives another lovely performance, for some reason she reminds me of Lyn Hathaway and I expect after her great roles in Cinderella, Darkest Hour and Guernsey that we will see her in many more movies.Everyone is good in this movie , special mention to veteran Tom Courtney, who pays an eccentric wistful character Eben Ramsey.No wonder this film works with a director like Mike Newell, who has directed great films like Four Weddings and a Funeral, Harry Potter Goblet of Fire and Donnie Brasco.If you enjoy a great story beautiful scenery and terrific acting please don't miss this Film a 9 out of 10 from this amateur film buff.",The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society
26,brankovranjkovic,The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society: Very British Drama,7,22 April 2018,"Fictional historical drama, based on the best-selling book of the same name. The reason for the extraordinarily long title is explained in the opening sequence.Set in 1940's Nazi occupied Guernsey, a small group of islanders regularly meet to discuss any books they can find, and this continues after the war. Stars Lily James as a successful author who receives a letter out of the blue from one of the literary society members, who gets her name and address from the sleeve of another book requesting she sends him more of the same. More letters are exchanged and she eventually decides to visit the society as research for her next book. At this point the film becomes a detective story and the author uncovers a tragic chain of events. This is a charming film about coping with loss and the value of community.

Stunning scenery and amazing cinematography. This film had a warmth to it that is often missing from films these days - except maybe Paddington.

Laughs and tears aplenty - it also features different flashbacks that are actually effective in telling the story (I'm usually not a fan of jumping around in time, but this is done well). Strong performance by Lily James in the lead, with an excellent supporting cast. The plot weaved around, slowly revealing layers and it kept my interest throughout - building into an enjoyably satisfying conclusion.Highly recommend if you're a fan of British cinema - especially if you enjoyed the likes of 'The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel', 'Paddington', and 'Their Finest'.",The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society

Lily James just may be the new Julie Andrews, always a joy to see. Michiel Huisman, who plays the farmer, is a new name to me (I haven't watched Game of Thrones), but he contributes a handsome central presence that reminded me of Alan Bates's Farmer Gabriel in the 1967 FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD. Tom Courtenay is solid as always. Penelope Wilton is outstanding as the widow drowning in the grief of two world wars.Slight and sentimental, yes, but very involving.

And some terrible instances of ham-fisted dialogue and crass, overt exposition and obvious plotting derail what is an honest affair.

32,bbewnylorac,Good but not great,7,8 May 2018,"This movie is a cinematographer's dream, and Zac Nicholson does a great job of capturing the beauty of an English Channel island under Nazi occupation during World War II. Director Mike Newell sets a crisp yet patient pace, and not a shot is wasted in moving the story forward. The scenery was lovely, so I was very disappointed to learn that this is the North Devon coast filling in for the island of Guernsey. The plot is interesting enough, with two heroines - the writer Juliet (Lily James) who visits in 1946 to find out more about the strange literary society, and the second heroine being Elizabeth (Jessica Brown Findlay), seen in flashback during the war on Guernsey who rebels agaiinst the Nazi invaders and helps shelter slave labourers, at the risk of her own safety. Elizabeth also has an affair with a Nazi doctor, Christian (Nicolo Pasetti) who turns out to be a nice man. The movie is much more watchable and substantial than some British period films such as Their Finest. It does have some good points to make about people in the war not being all black and white in their allegiances, about how books can be saviours to people in times of trouble, and how a motley crew of unrelated people can form strong bonds. I love the scene when the Society eats an illicit roast pig. Such a simple indulgence but they really savour it, as a shared, rare luxury, and as a simple victory against oppression. I feel that the movie focused too much on Juliet's love life, and her life in London. We don't see much about the Nazi peril to Guernsey natives. The invasion is given about 10 seconds of screen time. Yet too much time is given to filming Juliet gazing longingly at her love interest, the farmer Dawsey, or furiously scribbling research about the island. I don't think Lily James is a great actor - too many furiously wrinkled brows, and she's not a great kisser, but she tries hard. Huisman, as the farmer Dawsey, also isn't that great, but his role is a bit soppy. The film does seem to approve of very good looking people. If you are a little different looking (i.e. the actually beautiful Katherine Parkinson as Isola) you're dismissed as plain and lovelorn. 
Also the script's attitude to Chriistian, Elizabeth's Nazi lover, is confusing. In real life, you'd expect that the locals would regard Elizabeth's carousing with the enemy as a grave sin, that could endanger lives under occupation, a time when they rely on a united front against the enemy. But in the movie, the characters who disapprove of their relationship are painted as nasty. I guess the film is trying to say that love is love, and that not all Germans were bad.
Some reviewers didn't like the character of Juliet's American fiance, the wealthy officer Markham (Glen Powell), but I thought Powell did a great job, and even when he's rejected, he behaves understandably. 
Juliet's gay literary agent character, Sidney (Matthew Goode) was almost identical to Rupert Everett's hyper-supportive gay best friend character in My Best Friend's Wedding. Still, he's entertaining. 
I liked the ending, although I don't quite believe that Juliet would her give up her glamorous life in London to be a pig farmer's wife.
It is more picturesque, however.",The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society
33,CineMuseFilms,"a tale of friendship, romance, and love of literature",8,25 April 2018,"There are so many levels on which one can enjoy the curiously titled The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society (2018)that describing the film is a challenge. Like many British period dramas, it has an epic quality in how it reflects on the world as it was in the 1940s. Sumptuously filmed and beautifully acted, it blends historical insight into a finely-crafted tale of mystery and romance.Other than history buffs, most people would be unaware that German troops occupied the British Channel Islands of Guernsey and Jersey in 1940-45. Many Island children were evacuated to England just prior to the occupation and the invasion encountered virtually no military resistance. Under Nazi rule, many Islanders were sent to forced labour and concentration camps in Germany and all farm produce was confiscated for military use. The film opens with a group of Islanders out after curfew, having enjoyed an illicit roast pig and home-brewed gin even though strict food rationing was in place. Facing immediate arrest, they concoct an excuse about being members of The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society who have been enriching their minds while feeding on potato peels, as the Fuhrer would want. From this serendipitous moment, a local tradition is born.Switching to 1946, we meet Juliet Ashton (Lily James) a successful writer living comfortably in London and pondering ideas for her next book. Pursued by a wealthy American suitor, she enjoys the giddy glamour of a British high society that is rebuilding after the war. A letter from a member of the Guernsey Literary Society excites her interest and she soon travels to the Island to learn more. She becomes enchanted with its idyllic village life and rural tranquillity and how each member of the Society has their own wartime story to tell. There is also a new romance simmering where least expected, as well as guarded secrets and strong resistance to a book being written about them.This simple plotline understates the multiple sub-stories that are a montage of war-time Guernsey, including dark themes of Nazi collaboration, the trauma of children separated from families, and uplifting themes about how literature can bring people together across time and space. The original novel on which the film is based was framed around letters between Juliet and Society members, so the film's timeframes shift frequently but with seamless continuity. There are several charming exchanges about writers and novels that you would expect from lovers of literature. The filming aesthetic evokes the era with authenticity, while Lily James and the ensemble cast are superb.Some might say that this story is told through a soft-focus lens, mediated through the gentility of Juliet's privileged life and self-indulgent curiosity about the lives of others. That may be so, but her narrative perspective accentuates the world of difference between war-time London and Guernsey. Without such insights, the story would be just a warm-hearted melodrama. But the film offers much more than that. It is an engaging detective story, a study of survival under wartime occupation, and a tale of friendship, romance, and love of literature.",The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society
34,frukuk,Not a Jersey Royal,1,1 June 2020,"In the same way that, in a good film, the actors disappear while the characters remain, in this bad film it's the other way around. So it feels very much like actors acting, rather than characters behaving naturally.For example, there's a scene towards the end (around 100 minutes in), between Elizabeth McKenna (Jessica Brown Findlay) and Mark Reynolds (Glen Powell) which seems rushed and unreal.Something is clearly not right with this film, but I don't know if it's a poor screenplay, poor direction, poor acting, limited rehearsals or an unwillingness to reshoot scenes, that's at fault.Oh and Tom Courtenay is at his irritating worst; and Katherine Parkinson is at her hammiest: much closer to how she played the receptionist in Doc Martin than the head of department in The IT Crowd.",The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society

The Second Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society. This is a gripping story of one group of people on the Channel Island of Guernsey during the German occupation of world war 2. Sympathetically told, this story shares the horrors that this Island of people went through and how their compassion could lead to their downfall. Bringing together some wonderful actors, the film is set in 1946 with flashbacks to the war years. A writer called Juliet Ashton is drawn to the island by the chance encounter of a farmer and a book that once belonged to her. What follows is a tale of her struggle to discover their stories and the dilemma that faces her on whether to publish their very private experiences or not. It is also a story of love, and of survival. Beautifully shot with scenery well matched to the emotion, this film is a joy to watch.

If, however, you need your entertainment to convince and engage you this half-baked presentation will cause you nothing but irritation and exasperation. Lilly James as Juliet manages to pout and flounce like a four-year old dress-up princess. Her skills in acting are in repeating learned lines and nothing else. Other, better actors, in this presentation also put in poor performances. This perhaps suggests the actors' disengagement with the script and direction. They would certainly be aware of the glaring mistakes being made in depicting war-time occupied Guernsey. Not surprising when female authored work is converted into a vapid and stupid screenplay by ignorant men. This ignorance extends to some gross visual mistakes. Have you ever seen a rack of pork? No, you haven't and, more to the point, no farm boy or country bumpkin would make the mistake of cooking the whole part of a pig carcass that is usually made into bacon as a joint of meat.

39,patriciogl10,Do yourself a favor and watch this gorgeous film.,8,7 October 2018,"I honestly didn't know what to expect, the film's title certainly did enough to draw my attention and wonder what this movie was all about. I read its plot description and went in. I came across with a wonderful film, with amazing acting, very good dialogue and overall a compelling love story with a historical background which interested me greatly. When the first scene kicks in and we discover why the film is called The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society it all makes sense, and it's a rather funny scene, the way it develops, even though it takes place in an obscure context.The setting is just marvellous, it definitely adds to the film's structure. I thought it was interesting that the events take place after the Nazi occupation, although there are some flashbacks that refer back to the war. Lily James puts on an excellent performance, so do Michael Huisman (of Game of Thrones fame) and Penelope Wilton.
Really, I can't find something about this movie that I didn't like or enjoy. It is one of those films that entice you with the title and fully grab you with its fulfilling story.Another aspect that I find interesting is how they subtlety managed to blend the love interest between Juliet Ashton (James) and Dawsey Adams (Huisman) and the investigation Ashton was carrying out regarding Elizabeth McKenna's (Jessica Brown Findlay) disappearance by the hands of the Nazis, after helping someone in need in the midst of curfew. Neither one surpassed each other, and it had the added value of also be dealing with important pieces of literature, which along with tragedy, is what sustains this interesting group of people.This is a fine film, be sure to check it out!

There were underground hospitals, even an aborted railway system.... all built by slave labour .Simply having a few troops walk through the centre of town leaves a dearth of stories to be told.
How did they implement their takeover? How did they let the administration run the island? How did they treat the islanders?All of these plotline motherlodes were sacrificed for the love story
(which was quite well done, although telegraphed from the start).On reflection, the morning after viewing it, I would say that it's a typical U.K. picture, well acted with the usual overdoing it with kids and twanging of the heartstrings........ but not really my cup of tea.It still gets my back up after all these years, to see the way the class system was entrenched (and by all accounts it still is!)I would have preferred a bit more exploration of the Island culture itself and a bit more depth in the way they dealt with the occupation but....

41,msghall,Insipid British version of a Hallmark/Lifetime romantic melodrama.,4,20 August 2018,"All signs point to this being a stellar British film about post-WWII Guernsey. Reviews have been great, the acting is top-notch, the concept intriguing, the direction more than adequate. But under its guise as a post-wartime drama, this movie reeks of sentiment and romance at the expense of any revelations about this historical period of time. Feeling like a wasted opportunity, you never get to share the horrors and hardships endured by these people. The whole thing feels skin-deep, revealing neither the true nature of the characters nor the world in which they are desperately trying to restore amid the rubble.While the writing is at times sharp and revealing, the dialog most of the time is tepid and shows little imagination when it comes to encapsulating Guernsey as it recovers from the horrors of Nazi occupation. While the acting is mostly superb, the actors are somewhat blah, making one wonder why should we care about them? If you are into romantic tales full of lust and love, and if you find the major characters to be attractive and interesting, you many find this to be just the ticket.

Fans of old-fashioned romances need look no further. The thoroughly delightful cast, the handsome period design make also a good enough movie but the film is directed by Mike Newell, who made one of the greatest romantic movies, ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" so we expected even more.

Should you pit it against similar movies with similar themes, it's every bit as good if not better.I guess in this day and age, being given a steady diet of superhero dross and CGI blockbusters, a simple film with an expert cast that relies solely on a good story and the expertise and acting talents of the people involved to put it over, would seem alien to some, but for me it was a well crafted harkback to how films used to be made and indeed how they should still be made today if anybody had any sense.It was also nice (for once) to see a period piece told accurately without all the 21st century agendas one usually finds crammed in these days distorting the characters and plot,Lilly James, Matthew Goode, Jessica Brown Findlay and Dame Penelope Wilton make this a kind of Downton Abbey reunion of sorts as they head up an outstanding cast that also includes Sir Tom Courtenay, Michele Huisman, Glen Powell and Katherine Parkinson and it tells the story of a London author Juliet Ashton (James) who at wars end, becomes aware of and intrigued by the eponymous literary club that had been set up in Guernsey by a handful of beleaguered islanders during the Nazi occupation.Determined to find out more, she leaves her newly acquired American finance to venture to the recently liberated Island in order to meet its members, only to find beneath the rather jovial and tongue in cheek title, lies a tragic tale of loss and heartbreak and an inspirational story of hope, survival and sacrifice.The film is woven together well, striking a perfect balance between scenes involving the authors visit and the flashback scenes related to her by the people she meets.Plus we are presented with a conventional and touching love story that in my opinion is one of the most romantic I've ever seen on film. It all comes together flawlessly.There's a lot crammed into it's two hour run time but it never comes across as padded or bloated as director Mike Newell keeps it all together well.I heartily recommend this film to anyone.

44,ilovesaturdays,Has heart but is too simplistic,7,16 May 2020,"I love the novel because it's very witty & rich in character descriptions. Also, it's an epistolary novel, written as letters from various characters. This allowed the novel to carry the voices of all characters. Obviously, such a book is hard to adapt onscreen. Besides, books have an advantage of being descriptive. Sometimes what may be a single, yet important, paragraph in a book may take a few minutes on screen, so time becomes a limiting factor. The transition between the two different media is difficult and hence it's not very surprising that most (but not all) movies tend to be poorer representations of their original novels.A few crucial changes were made in the script & some characters from the novel were deleted especially Sophie & Remy. I think at least Sophie should've been retained because her absence makes it difficult to understand Sidney & Juliet's close association.However, putting all that aside, if I look at the movie in a more objective manner, then I'd say that the makers have done quite well. It comes off as a heart-warming tale depicting how literature & community spirit can play the role of a great buffer against the harshest conditions. The German occupation of Channel Islands made it necessary for these people to have each other to share their burdens. Lily James is good as Juliet Ashton, the sympathetic writer who wants to write their story.

But that aside, I really enjoyed it. The cast was stellar, the cinematography wonderful and the costumes beautiful especially Juliet's yellow dress. I am disappointed to read that it wasn't actually filmed on the island but it really didn't matter as I've never been there anyway.",The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society

Set after WW2 with flashbacks a couple of years earlier, to the German occupation of Guernsey (a British island in the English Channel, located closer to the French coastline than the English).

60,theshanecarr,Period Romance that would rather not engage with the period. But Romance!,3,10 May 2021,"I mean.... in most ways, this is exactly the film you think it is; a gentle, period, English romance in which a beautiful woman must determine who among her suitors is the right man.But in other ways it takes on material you don't at all expect - life under occupation, Nazi atrocities, questions of collaboration and guilt.The film, determined to play up the romance, and not alienate the viewers who want that, skates over horrific events that took place in occupied Guernsey (fictional events but based in brutal truth) and yet the tone never sat right with me for this reason.I love a feel-good movie. And I will cry at almost anything a movie wants me to. And finding love amidst the horror, or the aftermath of war, is something it is entirely possible to make a film about, but to do it in this jolly, whimsical, rom-com way seems disrespectful, and a bad choice. The victims, and in one misjudged case even a perpetrator, of these crimes are used as narrative macguffins to drive the action.The subsequent recriminations, guilt, and bitterness between those who collaborated and those who did not, in post-war Guernsey society are alluded to but never really explored despite one major plot point revolving around the ambiguity of what counts as collaboration, and whether the personal character of the enemy matters.But I feel like this review is making the film sound more interesting than it really is. It's fine. Lily James and Michel Huisman look terribly pretty. Katherine Parkinson is underused but fun. The landscape looks lovely. The costumes are stylish. And there's stuff in here about the value of reading, and how community can see us through adversity.If you're looking for a period romance that will warm the heart, you can find it here provided you're willing to join the film in looking away from the worst parts of humanity.",The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society
61,allstarrunner,Decent mindless fun,6,4 September 2018,"The movie starts off great, it really sucks you in right at the beginning and even manages to get the emotions flowing as you feel for the characters and the circumstances you find them in. The plot does really well until about half way through the movie and then it starts to muddle around and the pace slows down significantly and thus my emotional attachment to the characters. At the end of the day it is still a good film, just wish it was trimmed a bit and maybe remove about 15 minutes so it flows a bit better. The main love story is also about as cliche as it can possibly get, but I suppose that is somewhat expected with this genre.",The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society

Instead I was confronted to the umpteenth rehashing of a story that I feel like I've seen hundreds of times, and with a plot about as believable as a unicorn steak. The meddling protagonist is fairly insufferable, and of course lurve triumphs in the end, for she leaves a brilliant future with a dashing rich fiancee, to marry instead the incredibly well spoken and erudite pig farmer.

From start to finish you fall in love with each character, with the scenery, with books and in this case even a roasted pig. 
The back story of how the ""book club"" started is brilliant. Just people needing to connect during war. People that know each other yet really don't then finally become a family. They find companionship, love, strength, loss and family in this little group who all are just trying to survive during the most horrific existence .

71,postmortem-books,Decent enough fare for the silver-haired cinema-goers,6,23 April 2018,"If the title of this review seems a little condescending my only excuse is that I am one of those silver-haired cinema-goers and I quickly sussed out from the actors involved (Tom Courtney, Penelope Wilton) that we would be served up a variation on ""Quartet"" and ""Exotic Marigold Hotel"". And so it transpired. Nothing wrong with that I will be the first to admit but perhaps I was looking for something with a bit more bite. Guernsey was a Nazi occupied territory during the war and there is a story to be told but here we fall back into something that is more or less a romance/mystery story which telegraphs its ending way before the end of its two hours running time (cuts could have been made).There are plot holes, coincidences and events that may worry the more discerning of viewers and when one begins to wonder just how many changes of clothes the character played by Lily James can squeeze into a very small suitcase one realises that the incidentals are beginning to overtake the story.Not having read the book I cannot comment on any changes that might have been made.",The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society
72,mt-95256,"An Ideal Sunday Afternoon Film. Ultimately Unremarkable, But Perfectly Pleasant",6,23 April 2018,"TL;DRAbsolutely English and proud to be soEasy-going but enjoyable enough storyA little too long and the mystery can sometimes be a little underwhelmingPredictable plotHeart-warming characters and solid performancesUltimately unremarkable, but perfectly pleasant--------------------------There's a strange genre that seems to have been around for a few decades now. Some may call them comedy, drama, romance... though usually they incorporate genre tropes from all three. Yet the most common element that runs through them all is that they are 1.) sweet, 2.) able to be enjoyed universally and 3.) unequivocally English - with the crème-de-la-crème of British thespians and, quite often, set during WWII. The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society (no, the title doesn't get easier to say the more you try) absolutely fits alongside those types of films being lovely in every sense (though sometimes a bit too lovely) with a pleasant story and great cast. Still, there's nothing special or unique about the film itself that allows it go above and beyond the existing classics.It's an easy-going, yet interesting story that effortlessly commands an audience. On the other hand, however, it takes a while for the story to get going, eventually exacerbating the other issue of the film being too long for what it is (ideally a film such as this would run in between 90 to 105 minutes). On top of this, the plot is fairly predictable; it's not too challenging to guess the ending before even the half-way mark. Still, it balances the stories of Juliet's relationships with the hunt for Elizabeth well, making the film part mystery - although it is admittedly a shame that most revelations concerning Elizabeth's eventual disappearance rarely seem like ground-breaking discoveries. Still, it's an enjoyable story, but this is mainly down to the characters who make it up.The real joy of the characters is not only watching them open up to Juliet and slowly tell her the story of Elizabeth's disappearance piece by piece, but by getting to know them and seeing their personalities unfold before us. This is strengthened by solid performances of heart-warming, well-written characters. Even the more secondary characters aren't glossed over and make genuine contributions to the film. From Goode's the paternal publisher to the smarmy Powell's American boyfriend, able to carefully tread the line between being simultaneously charming and repulsive. The group of society members themselves are the ones at the very heart of the film itself. These characters are the highlight of the movie, each of them unique and individual, able to portray the connection between the characters in what they do and say. Lily James once again proves to be a wonderful lead, charismatic and lovely to watch. It's difficult to predict a Mike Newell film when he's so diverse; from directing the likes of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire to Four Weddings and a Funeral, there isn't anything specific we can expect from him, other than he has the ability to craft entertaining and enjoyable films - though nothing quite as iconic since Four Weddings. The story and writing are enjoyable and the cast really sell it; while it may be ultimately unremarkable, it's nevertheless perfectly pleasant. An ideal film to watch with your feet up on a lazy Sunday afternoon with the whole family.",The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society
73,tenyearreunion,Faultless.,10,24 August 2018,"I write this moments after the credits have rolled on this movie, though pausing after some dust got in my eye......honest guv.What a simply wonderful, delightful, well casted, acted, directed, scored piece of film making.I honestly kick myself for not seeing this at the cinema so I could soak in the scenery and fully engross myself in the tale of Lilly James peeling (pardon the pun) back the layers of the GLAPPS story. Though again, this film fell victim of a very short run time at my local cinema and I missed it.Every cast member is spot on with who their roles and the part they play in the story. Lily James, a favourite of mine since Cinderella, really excels in this character. Though I wish she would expand her repertoire a little, she does this type of young english lady so superbly well, why not play it again as the leading lady?The film plays out like a murder mystery, only better. I was enthralled and captivated by a well scripted and edited story. I saw no padding, felt no unnecessary pause, it was perfectly paced and even the slightly predictable ending was concise. I don't fault the ending, it could only end one way!I credit the Mayo and Kermode church for yet again drawing attention to this gem that more people need to seek out on streaming, blu ray or dvd. I was very tired and was going to watch a Harry Potter film for the umpteenth time but I am very glad I didn't.I don't give 10/10 to any film without thought. I can't recall the last I gave on this site. However, in this instance, I sit trying to think how I would change this film to make the last 2 hours be more enjoyable and I cannot think of any.

74,sq8188-162-458059,Nice Adaptation,7,23 November 2020,"American writer Mary Ann Shaffer penned the framework of The Guernsey novel which were completed by her niece Anne Barrows. Shaffer was inspired by the war time stories of the island when she visited there. Published mere months after Shaffer passed away the book became a NY Times Best Seller. Not surprisingly its depiction of human dignity and sustenance while going
through hardship and travail of enemy occupation captured the imagination of readers everywhere. Not agreeing with the flighty dismissal of one Roger Ebert Reviewer about the nazis in the movie being caricatured and his quick comparison of patriotic sympathesizers in recent Charlottville demonstration equate to true evil - a liberal jab ? No, these nazis were terrifying, like when a young work-camp boy escaped and aided by the courageous altrusistic
Elizabeth and later shot ranged out on the spot when he was caught, no, the fear is real. Also the same fear persisted even before that as Dawsy the pig farmer tried to persuade Elizabeth from coming to the aid of a fellow human because of threat of nazi barbarism. Then there were rays of hope as a german officer who was a doctor before the war came to help out local farmer in the a
calf delivery and befriended the farmer. Their friendship was genuine. There are many other things to like in this movie. It does tell a powerful story, and deserves a more somber treatment from an american stand point. But perhaps to its defense, the ""britishness"" of how they handle adversity with understated humor can explain this rendition. Lilly James heads the cast as the narrator who shown she grew with the story; Michael Hulsman hits the right note as the laconic farmer, and other cast members notably Penelope Wilton and Laura Findley Brown seems to have come straightly off the set of Downton Abbey and gorgeous cinematography completes the bill. Only thing ""off"" was the score was not quite suitable for this cogent human drama - too mild and without any punctuations like when Elizabeth's fate was finally revealed, a high point of the plot, the music was oddly silent !

77,vinnieboards,A Hidden Gem,9,8 February 2021,"During this awful pandemic, one of the few upsides has been the ability to catch up on movies I might have otherwise overlooked.I decided to give The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society a try, and when explaining the virtues of this film you may assume early doors that I think its a bit of a dud - I can assure you it isn't.The film follows a somewhat linear format. Girl gets marriage proposal, girl meets another gentleman she has been corresponding with by letter, girl falls in love with said gentleman, girl gets her man. A plot line that has been delivered countless times before. I guessed the climax of this film very early on - but it didn't matter.The journey the film takes you on, from a glamorous post war London to a pig farm on the Isle of Guernsey is enchanting. The character development is rich, the story is complex, intelligent and at certain times, moving. While the lead actors all put in an excellent shift, it is the supporting cast which elevate the film. Katherine Parkinson as the eccentric, gin boot legging singleton is superb as is Tom Courtney who offers a number of comic moments. Penelope Wilton is also brilliant as a mother stricken by grief and guilt.There is no CGI in this film, no explosions or showers of bullets. There are no A list actors either. This is good old fashioned story telling at it's best. It makes you sad, it makes you smile and it warms your heart.It would get a 10 but sadly it wasnt filmed in Guernsey (it was actually filmed in Devon). If it had been, I have no doubt if would have proved to be even more enchanting.Bravo.",The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society

Sure it does, it's the plot of a dime a dozen romance movies and this one's not really any difference.

81,SB100,Banal,5,3 May 2020,"Excessively sentimental film that really falls into the 'chickflick' category despite pretensions to something more meaningful. It totally fails to explore properly the tensions that arise in a society under military occupation, and is very simplistic in its view of good and bad.Lily James is adequate as the lead and looks very well in the 1940s fashions, but some of the other characters are more caricatures than real people. The child parts are played well. Jessica Brown Findlay's talents are wasted in the small role of the saintly Elizabeth.Most irritating is the way it has been filmed in terms of locations. There's nothing intrinsically wrong with filming in England a story which is set in Guernsey; but it would be better if it was at least depicted realistically. During WWII St Peter Port was a substantial town with a proper harbour, and Guernsey had an airfield (at which the occupying German forces landed); but from this film you would think that planes could only land on the beach, and that St Port was a tiny fishing village on a hill.",The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society

Great performances, especially Lily James (surprising after creating little impression in Downton Abbey), Tom Courtenay and Penelope Wilton. It doesn't matter that the actual story is fictional, the real events of the Guernsey occupation gave it substance and a subject rarely used before. The supporting cast also gave excellent performances particularly the young boy and Isola.I feel sorry for the critics whose reviews show an insecurity and they seemed scared to say anythng which might rock their peer group. It's not too long, the 2 hours just flew by, Michael Huisman sensibility underplayed Dawsey's attraction to Juliet because of the circumstances, Juliet was more open in her feelings and it was a voyage of discovery for her, her journey was the heart of the film.

84,irinafiruti,What a surprise! Charles and Mary Lamb's book was one of my childhood's favorites,7,26 August 2019,"...so I dearly related to this part of the story. People get connected by all sort of unexpected things, so why not by a good book? Marguerite Yourcenar's "" Denier du reve"" thread of narration follows the fate of a ...dime handed by various characters that get connected to each other in this way.
On the other hand, I also connected to the story of the club itself which is not so singular as it may looks: harsh times have the virtue of bringing people together and, growing up in the Romania's comunist era, I have lived among the members of a group like this, only they were rather tied one to the others through...music. Gatherings were organized ( or spontaneous) semi-clandestine to listen to classical music which was also a pretext to spread news from the free world and listen to free radio channels from the West. There was also a custom to bring somethig to eat and in those times when food was scarce and precious we have not been far from eating something as bad as a potato peel pie! But most of all the air was vibrating of this joy of togetherness and of full support between us. A refuge from the adversities which made those long decenies more endurable. So I fully recognize this experience and I can testify it's authenticity!
Back to the movie, the chemistry between the characters is obvious, you can feel the intensity of their emotions far from the screen difficultly fading away after the end. The characters are not fully developped though but as I haven't read the book so I can't say if it's the plot or the book. From this perspective I kept doubting the veridicity of the relation between a writer and a farmer - there can be some exceptions, of course, but the ""usual"" writer and the ""usual"" famer live in such different worlds that one can seriously doubt that a deep connection is to be established between the two.

The biggest issue is that all of the elements of the story in the first half of the story that are ripe with the MOST conflict (the Nazis taking over Guernsey Island, a group almost being arrested for it, the formation of a pretend book club that in turn becomes a real book club) are told in flashback, which robs the story of immediacy and tension.

this movie made me realise why I should start reading books again...",The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society
97,trixie30,Lovely,9,29 October 2020,"I read the book shortly after it came out and loved it. Books told in letters have always been either delightful or pretentious, at least to me. My husband feels the same and concurred with me that this one was in the delightful category.Americans in particular don't seem to know much about the Channel Islands, that is the English ones. Confession: I only do because my grandfather was stationed in England for 29 months with the 8th air corps and knew people from Guernsey and one of my husband's aunt's by marriage is from Jersey.I did not really know about the occupation until talking to my husband's aunt, who was a child at the time. We later watched the mini-series ""Island at War,"" which which told the story of how and when the occupation happened.This movie does a more than credible job of recreating the events and feeling of the book. It's well cast. Actually, when I read who had been considered or cast for Juliet originally, I was glad that they didn't work out. It's not because I don't care for the actresses; I do, very much. But Lily James captures Juliet's spirit, fears, and experiences perfectly. She is a delight. Michiel Huisman is new to us, but also perfectly cast. I tend to nitpick when actors are cast who don't look like I've envisioned them in a book. I did not do that this time. Maybe because the actors immersed themselves or maybe because they really did look like I envisioned or maybe some of both.This is a movie that, like the book, both informs and entertains.

103,jchm-21143,Quite a ridiculous film,3,22 November 2018,"Not the storyline. That seems quite acceptable if unremarkable.
But the production design.
This seems to be wholly aimed people with no knowledge of the time period or location in which the film is set. It gives an overwhelming impression of being aimed solely at American tourists.
I suppose the very fact that four of the cast appeared in ""Downton Abbey,"" (that wet dream fantasy of Daily Telegraph readers) should have rung alarm bells to start with. Just like that TV show, it presents a completely inaccurate and unbelievable picture.
Black American soldiers dancing with white girls in 1946? Come on...
And what would a Black GI be doing in London in '46 anyway?
Then there's the Male lead - who probably would have been run out of town in the rural post-war UK. Hair over his collar, designer stubble - and a wedding band?!?!!. No sorry - nobody looked like that then.
But the most laughable issue is the location. Guernsey looks absolutely nothing like the north coast of Devon where this was filmed. I'm sure it's much prettier and meets the criteria demanded to appeal to a certain ""Gee... ain't that quaint?"" type of audience. But to anyone with the slightest knowledge of reality, it comes over as absurd.

I am drawn to softer movies that roll out their direction quietly rather than slapping the viewer in the face to make sure that they know what the film is about. This marvellous British film is about something, but it meanders around before it finally sets its various subjects.
I won't bother to rewrite the nerve's of the film; those details are available better than my disjointed writing in other excellent IMDb comments. Suffice to say that the substance of the movie is tender, warm and extremely non-Hollywood with all that last comment carries with it: no guns, no cars and no violence of any kind. 
The viewer does not have to think about the film; just let the beauty of the environment, the building interiors and the warmth of the interaction of the characters envelope you and relish a movie experience that requires you only to go to another place, another time with an abundance of warm characters.

The adaptation and direction (though quite different from the book in many aspects) have been done with such sensitivity and wisdom (but what else would you expect from the director of ""Enchanted April"" and ""HP and the Goblet of Fire""?), and the acting is so exquisitely done that I consider this quiet film to be almost flawless. The pain, the tragedy, the terrors of the German occupation are there, but so is the humanity, the compassion, the courage, and the beauty of clinging to what life has to offer - connection. ""Only connect"", wrote E. M. Forster, and this film has captured it beautifully. Not to mention that it is a paean to my lifelong passion: books, reading, and sharing those words.

This time Netflix got it right with their original movie The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society. From start to finish this feature is an entertainment delight of terrific acting, tremendous directing and fabulous scenery.
I admit you really have to pay attention as sometimes the dialogue is hard to follow and you could certainly miss something very valuable to the story being told. However when you make it through you have been on a journey that will enlighten and stimulate the senses to a high that will make you feel the ultimate exhilaration, but also some sadness that the movie is over.
The final scenes brought tears to my eyes and this very seldom happens to me with a movie. All I can say is Netflix we need more movies from you like this one.

122,TADKALABS,A charming post WW2 saga of some secrets & a Love Triangle !,7,14 July 2019,"It's longish name and presence of Michiel Huisman & the Brit actress Lily James picked my interest and I decided to have a dekho. It's a nice movie no doubt. One of those whom you think Pretty Nice after its over and feel at peace types 😊Plot is woven around Lily who is some what an established author and is in London in 1946 which is still ravaged under post effects of WW2. For some strange reason she publishes all her books under a male pseudo identity. She is looking for a new home to buy but which ever home she visits, she gets the nightmarish flashback of her parents dying in their house which was bombed. She has a boy friend who is in Army. Most of their meetings happen only in some clubs and parties. After establishing this narrative, the camera pans over to the beautiful English country side to the Island of Guernsey and starts establishing a premiseThe flashback starts during German occupation. That's a time when most of the farm produce and livestock and poultry etc is confiscated by the NAZIs to feed their forces. And to escape from the prying eye of NAZI soldiers, few English folk have a secret meeting in their dilapidated country home where they cook pork and have gin along with Potato Pie and generally have a nice time, away from the town & prying eyes of the German soldiers. The NAZIs get a whiff of the act and raid the place to find these Brit folks though they have switched off all the lights and lurching in a corner. Upon confrontation as to what they were doing in the dead of night so far from town, they mutter and make up a story that they have a Literary society and a book club and meet there periodically. The captain asks what's the name of their club and then one thinks for long and comes up with this unusual name - Guernsey Literary & Potato Peel Pie Society 😃 Then since they have made up this story, they go on to actually establish this as a book club with Name Plate and the works just in case if NAZIs come looking again and that way they can actually meet too since they have made it public to the Germans now!
The flashback then comes to real time 5 years later to 1946 and now Lily is assigned to write a story on the Literary society in the London Times Literary Section. That's when she gets in touch with Michiel Huisman who is sort of unofficial spokesman to the Society and starts exchanging letters with him, enquiring about the same. They both are nuts over Late 17th century poet Charles Lamb & Jane Austen and that brings them closer. Then one fine day she sets out to Guernsey Island to meet the Literary Society Members and put in place the article post meeting all the members and interacting with them. Every member of Society welcomes her warmly and exchange many notes and treat her like a VIP and give her a tell all kind of run down but also hide few facts from her - so she thinks. To top it they don't want her to publish the article about their Society in London Times at all and refuse to tell her why they feel that way! The REFUSAL OF PERMISSION to her to publish the story and and how she goes about unravelling the reasons and the dark murky past of on goings during German occupation times, makes up the rest of the entire movie and keeps you engrossed till the end!Photography is excellent and the plot is well woven, thanks to the director Mike Newell who knows his game well and has proved so already in 4 Wedding and Funeral & Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, hence needs no introduction 😊 The British country side is made look more beautiful and quaint N charming thanks to brilliant camera work. The script is neat and editing is slick too. Over all a 7 on 10 easily !!",The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society

Why would anyone ever have that expectation? Second, well, okay, the romance was predictable. But, my goodness, nothing else in the movie was! I don't want to write spoilers, so will just say each character in this movie had a depth and complexity and struggle that was beautifully acted. And there was nothing predictable at all as to how their heartbreak was revealed, or the loving support they received from each other to help them to face it and survive. Finally, why ding the film because of the set location? (I still love My Big Fat Greek Wedding, though it was filmed in Toronto, and set in my hometown of Chicago.)The acting was wonderful: Lily James, Michiel Huisman and Katherine Parkinson touched me the most, but the cast was all great. I also loved the cinematography, music, and costumes.I laughed and cried and got goosebumps at this beautifully told story of ugliness and darkness entwined with hope, care, resilience and compassion. The people who wrote the sourpuss reviews really need to open their eyes and ears and try it again.

Now the acting was good - no one should really have a problem with that since there is much worse now days - but a few of the main characters were a little weak or just too flawed. The situation where the girl suddenly turns on the fiance was really bad... talk about a blind-side hit. It seemed that they had everything going for them, and then whammo!

Then it descends into the gut-wrenching horror of a Nazi occupation, coming out into comedy a little later, descending into ""truth"" and horror and re-surfacing again. You can have mixed emotion in a novel, as it takes time to read. A film needs one emotional note, or at least not major ups and downs as this one has. As an example of a poorly structured film it's one for students to examine: Don't Do It Like This. The film stays - presumably - close to the book. It should have thrown away huge plot-chunks and made them filmic. Anything else has the smell of exploitation, and using people's (film) lives as plot-points.

Beautifully shot and well acted, this moving story of the German occupation of the small island of Guernsey during World War II focuses on how the occupation affected those who lived there. Lily James is perfect as a curious London writer who comes to the island on a whim and is drawn into the lives of the members of a book club, started on the island during the war. The regular meetings allowed the club members a legal reason to meet and socialize.But the story also explores the dark side of the occupation, including those who worked with the Germans and the painful repercussions.

133,SergeantReview,Enjoyable Watch with An Engaging Sub-Storyline,7,18 February 2021,"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society surprisingly impressed me.There is a surplus of these kind of films. A passionate writer who has it all, money, fame and a seemingly perfect relationship, but despite all their prosperity they are desperate to 'break free', subsequently to find the love of her/his life. It's a classic story, certainly this movie had all of that, but it also had much more.The acting is commendable, Lilly James is always a great choice for an intriguing female lead. I thought the supporting actors playing the rest of the society members were also good, especially Penelope Wilton who really stood out. My favourite element of this movie was the story within the story. That the film isn't necessarily about the main love intrest but about the Romo and Juliet esc relationship that we uncover throughout the film. This movie has fairly dramatic moments but is very emotionally steady throughout, that's not always a bad thing. Additionally, for me the ending was very corny. I can appreciate the writer wanted a happy ending, but it could have been done differently in my opinion.A really enjoyable film, definitely worth the watch. Offers a different perspective of post WW2 times in a fairly light hearted but impactful style.",The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society
134,clivehodges,A London writer forms a bond with the members of a book club on the island of Guernsey,7,17 April 2018,"British and French troops fighting Nazi Germany suffer a stunning defeat in May 1940 on mainland Europe. Germany invades the Channel Islands, livestock is impounded and a night curfew imposed. Late one night, Elizabeth (Jessica Brown Findlay) Eben (Tom Courtenay) Isola (Katherine Parkinson) and Dawsey (Michiel Huisman) are noisily making their way home after feasting on a roasted pig that Amelia (Penelope Wilton) has hidden from the invaders. A blinding headlight terrifies the friends and a group of soldiers wielding machine guns prepare to arrest the group for being out after dark. Quick-thinking Elizabeth offers the suggestion that they are merely returning home from a meeting of their book club. She fumbles around for a name ... and The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is born. The islanders eagerly take the opportunity to meet regularly to discuss whatever books they can lay their hands on. The meetings continue after the war. The friends wish to add to their library and Dawsey writes to Juliet Ashton (Lily James) a name he's found inside a book by Charles Lamb, requesting the name of a London book shop that might stock further books by that author. Juliet, a successful writer with a bestseller recently published, is struggling to find inspiration for her next book. She's intrigued by the curiously named Guernsey Literary & Potato Pie Peel Society and - as one does on the spur of the moment - flies off to Guernsey to meet its members. The film is based on a novel by Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Burrows that sold 7.5 million copies worldwide. Eben, in the film, is an amalgam of three characters in the book: the fisherman, the postmaster and the islander who thought up the recipe for the very first potato peel pie. The Guernsey Literary & Potato Peel Pie Society is a charming, feel-good romantic drama. There's much to admire: a good story-line, excellent acting, unobtrusive music, a mystery to unravel, touches of humour and a few emotional, teary, tissue-dabbing moments. It's also predictable, minimises the blood and gore from the aircraft attacks in the re-enactments and, at just over two hours, overstays its welcome.",The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society

My impression is that the first 15 minutes were interesting but after that it was a by-the-numbers story and I could predict what would happen next and I was correct.Therefore, I would rate this film as average.

Didn't care for the character of Mark. Despite him serving some point to the story, with a crucial part of the plot being resolved with his involvement, he was rather one-dimensional and didn't have much personality or anything to make one endear to him.

148,delalluvia,Nice slice of English pie but tasteless,4,2 September 2018,"This is a great movie to watch on a cold afternoon, wrapped up warm on the couch eating cookies and drinking hot chocolate.It is a WW2 ""lite"" movie. It tells the story of two women (ostensibly); one, a woman who endured the hardships of the German occupation of the Channel Island of Guernsey during WW2 and the second, a successful author of light amusing stories who comes to Guernsey to meet the titular book club of which the former woman was a member and discovers her secret.However, the movie makers went the commercial route of making a chick/rom-com flick instead. The producers didn't give the heroine author much of a character, you learn very little about her other than her trauma of losing her parents in the Blitz, and that she wants to write something important. The producers then keep the Guernsey woman character almost completely absent from the movie and turn on the British charm. The movie has gorgeous scenery - but not from the titular island - and stock 'eccentric' characters, looking healthy and well fed throughout, in lovely tweed suits and stylish hats and sexy pig farmer wear. The movie veers from the book in several important ways, some to its detriment, e.g. - it removed substantial supporting characters and subplots and some to its improvement e.g. - it made the fiance character of Juliet's a much more decent suitor. In the book, you wonder why the author is with such a cad. Here you understand why she's attracted to him.Still, the movie kept to the book in 2 important ways which sadly, take you out of what little reality the movie provides:1. It makes the Germans dumb yet well versed in the English language enough to know what a Literary Society was and to accept that as an excuse for a drunk group smelling of BBQ to be breaking curfew in the middle of the night. 2. That a sophisticated and well educated woman would want to leave a booming literary career in post war sophisticated London for a pig farm in the middle of nowhere, no matter how handsome the farmer and that a pig farmer would want a wife who will not be helping with the pigs, but instead will want to be indoors writing full time and thus be little help at all to him. Even Beatrix Potter stopped writing when she became a farmer and rancher of sheep. Juliet seems to take great pride in her writing and career, but yet seems willing to give it all up to slop pigs.It seems to be a story of PTSD suffering Juliet wanting to wallow in the past and painful memories of the war (in a tiny scene, her fiance picks up on that) along with the denizens of an isolated island with a pig farmer, rather than pick herself up and move on into the very bright future with her glamorous American diplomat suitor.The WW2 scenes are interesting, as the German occupation of the Channel Islands and their horrendous treatment of the occupants is one of the many war stories not widely known. But expect the rest to be as predictable as tea time and as glossy as a coffee table book.",The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society

Jane was Ebens daughter. I can't believe how much they got wrong. The characters were not welcoming. She didn't have to just arrive unannounced, And none of it seemed to be reasonably wrong for adaptation purposes. She didn't have to go back to London either - I wasn't expecting it to follow the story to a T - obviously a screenplay must be abridged but this is so frightfully unlike the story it does such an injustice and changes not only the events but more importantly the concepts of the characters and essence of the story. Considering how much I loved the actors previous works and what not this is very disappointing that the screenwriter and director And producers wouldn't attempt to handle a beautiful story with more care. They had such a good opportunity to make a good film. It's just sort of a hack job and I'd be upset with myself to destroy the very essence of the story if I were the adapter of it.

I wish I was able to convey my opinion.The acting of the film is good, but I think the script is problematic and it is not clear exactly what the writer wants to say, a mixture of unreal love story, World War II, which mostly in and of itself every movie which is about World War II, Nazis, and also British movies especially old-fashioned will have two more scores regardless of whether it is a good film or not. We do not see anything special about the Nazis in this film, as well as the unnecessary dragging of the film by the writer and director seems to be a big weakness because it seems that it has nothing more to say. A love story in a movie that was just to please the viewers, which of course I think was one of the biggest weaknesses of the movie because it was unrelevent and showed a person being unreal and unstable rather than real love. First I saw it because of the score which is above 7 and somehow the events in the movie. It was not a bad movie in general, but now after watching it, I can say that it doesnt deserve above this score. It deserve below 7. I gave it 2 to adjust it a little.

160,threeleggedant,Wow! Didn't See This coming,9,21 August 2021,"Found this on Netflix and had never heard of it before.Having been to Guernsey in about 1970, and then 2008, as a visitor, I had a bit of knowledge of the history. Furthermore, I read the book about the Jersey occupation from the perspective of a doctor, and obviously heard the term, ""Jerrybag"", being an abusive term about young women who hooked up with Germany soldiers.The occupation took place just after my father was born, and just 25 years before I was born, so I have been brought up with 'views' about he occupation.This film puts a lot of it in context. From reading around the subject, it was already clear that the Germans were (almost) as much prisoners as were the islanders. The film makes it abundantly clear that there were also slaves during the occupation, but it doesn't dwell on it (a bit of a shame).What the film does do, or attempt to, is to remove some of the stigma from the women who hooked up with the Germans. It is distasteful, but how shameful was it really? And did they really deserve to be tarred and feathered after the occupation just because they were women? Basically, were they subjects of male subjugation, and were males in the islands treated less harshly? They probably were, but who are we to judge?This is at the core of this movie, and it is better for it.Looking back on it, the child, 'Kit', would be two years younger than my father who I miss greatly, and would have born in the same year as my mother. The movie (haven't read the book) is stronger for the fact that Elizabeth is never found because it puts the story firmly in its time when people would disappear without trace, and the film doesn't try to follow this up.With regard to the settings, and some of the props, it does rather fail miserably. It could have been done much better. Why, for instance, right at the beginning of the movie does the publisher have a lamp from a lathe on his desk as a desk lamp? It rather looks like the prop buyer was buying random 'old' stuff off eBay without anybody advising them? And the Weymouth angles were wrong as were the ship approaches to Guernsey.",The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society

However, based on the number of stars I give for this film, it's clear that I am willing to give an exception. I like the idea about how a love story between two bibliophiles can emerge from the letters they exchanged between them and their love for books. First, you will have guessed the ending anyway after five minutes entering the film, who would end up with whom. The film practically has all the cliches you know about a film involving a romantic love story. This includes the choice she makes at the end, which fails to follow the pragmatic logic that I try to comprehend. But, who cares? Because I enjoy the entire film thoroughly due to its multi-layered narrative and gorgeously shot scenes. The journey to unravel the whole story itself was executed admirably. Secondly, the film is all about love, although not just about romantic love, if I am allowed to make a category. It's also about family and friendship. The chemistry amongst the characters is built-up supremely. It also provides us with a glimpse of the sorrowful after-effect of the war, because war does not end simply when both sides choose to drop the guns. In conclusion, the ending is very predictable, but story-telling wise it's amazing. Now, I am planning my next trip to Guernsey.

Changed personalities. Dawsey is not the same person he was in the novel. Juliet is nosy and annoying. Amelia is hard and cold. Half the characters are missing.

173,andy-69219,Predictable and dull,2,9 May 2020,"Watching this is like eating pasta without any sauce: it needs something to liven it up. It's a ""nice"" film without any convincing drama or interest. Lily James plays the leading role but without credibility. (The scene in which she is imitating a yawn/stretch at her typewriter reminded me of my own awful rehearsal for my GCSE Drama exam). Unfortunately, there was no depth to this character. Lily James is usually a good actress but I'd guess here that the director, Mike Newell, unwittingly focused on the actress' beauty rather than her acting ability. In one scene, we watch Lily dutifully flutter her eyelids perfectly as she watches a balloon float to the ceiling. There are too many scenes like this, one in particular when one character dubiously offers a pathetic swoon, ""you're beautiful"" and Lily fakes embarrassment. I squirmed with embarrassment myself as I watched their performance in this scene, like so many others in this film. I'd have preferred to focus on the real story of the film - and the one that Lily is researching - which became somehow reduced in importance or supplementary to a cliched love story.
The love story? There's no on-screen chemistry between Lily James and Michiel Huisman, and their story felt mechanically orchestrated rather than genuine.
Overall, I felt the whole performance was quite amateur and the story lacked intrigue or humour to keep me engaged. Apparently, much of the original story was omitted to the detriment of the film and could have ensured adequacy of characters and plot to sustain interest. I did watch it to the end and immediately thought, what a waste of time. Yet the cast is pretty good; it's just that the director has not brought out the best in them or the story. The best performance by far is by Penelope Wilton, whose ice-cold reception at the start is palpable and whose character adapts well to changing circumstances.",The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society

182,jay_eh,A Must-Watch for Bibliophiles,7,15 August 2018,"'Earth seemed a desert I was bound to traverse, seeking to find the old familiar faces.'~Charles LambSet against the backdrop of World War II, during the aftermath of the German occupation of Guernsey , the movie traces the development of a tie between two temporally remote yet subconsciously similar worlds as the protagonist, Juliet Ashton is found reiterating,"" I belong to you ...."" as she finds solace in the fresh bond that she has formed with this family. Books lay the foundation of this relation as the pig ranch farmer,Dawsey Adams establishes his contact with the outside world by corresponding through letters with the help of the address mentioned on the copy of Lamb's The Selected Essays of Elia which he happens to salvage during the Club's desperate attempt to institute the reading group that they swore to be a part of, on the spur of the moment,to justify their violation of the curfew or in Dawsey's words as they had to keep a roast pig secret from the Germans.
Juliet, writing under the pseudonym Izzy Bickerstaff, chooses to call her book, 'a collection of faintly amusing essays', and claims to be working on English Foibles: A Miscellany of English Absurdity which takes a dig at London Society for Public Decency which advocates trousers for horses. Her popular works thrived on instances such as these which were able to tickle the audience and make them burst into laughter. The plot of the movie also brings the struggles of an aspiring writer to the fore as she is privy to certain privileges based only on her interim popularity, wherein lies the danger that is foreshadowed in the poignant image of her room literally razed to the ground in the London blitz.She frantically tried to grasp whatever she could lay her hands on, in this case, the paperweight with a bird poised to fly in a dream like sequence. As a result of this ominous flash from her past, she walks away from the irresistible comfort of a crystal clear posh flat on the pretext that she'd feel like a fraud there. To her manager's utter dismay and in spite of his staunch dissuasion, she decides to get back to her poky bedsit in Battersea with three suitcases and a typewriter, relinquishing the consolation of a proper home thereby embracing suffering over luxury.Markham Reynolds,a diplomat and clairvoyant, offers her proper premises to cater to her writing needs. He holds the promise of a secure future to her. He makes such an elaborate show of his love as he throws ball in her honour and crams her apartment with rose vases as on one such occasion, Mrs Burns complains about her tenant's houses brimming with vases.These vases,however,do not find a place in Juliet's room unlike the handpicked floret that Kit or Dawsey present her with. As the plot progresses, she struggles to juggle between being a diplomat's fiancé and an aspiring independent writer. Nevertheless, it's not that difficult to conjecture which role she settles for. Indubitably, she is more drawn to the long black tunnel than the carnival.In a desperate bid to keep her close to him, Reynolds proposes her on the day she sets out for Guernsey.The bucolic Guernsey, with its tranquil beaches, picturesque scenes of lush green meadows with long grasses and wild waves lashing against the lofty mountains, has been restored back to life from the German occupation which once had turned it into a fortress laid with landmines. This transformation of a besieged territory into a heavenly haven happens owing to the relentless efforts of the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society to enjoy life even amidst adversities. The German soldiers had taken away Dawsey's pigs and had ordered him to grow potatoes.Food had become scarce and proper meals could be had only in memory.It is at this juncture that we are introduced to Elizabeth Mckenna,the founder of the club,who proves to be an ideal which Ashton could probably get inspired from.We were all Hungry but it was Elizabeth who realised our true starvation for connection,company...~Dawsey AdamsEben Ramsay,a local postmaster,is a peculiar character whose unique creation Potato Peel Pie with no butter, no flour just potatoes sounds silly and absurd but it is symbolic of something earthy sans all fancy superfluities; it is as pliable as potatoes that can be teemed with anything .In addition to that, somethings as crude as potato peels which are discarded, are reminiscent of those who survived the dark phase of German occupation.The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society presents a stark contrast to the book launch where Ashton,shows much faith in Izzy than herself and tries to dodge most of the questions directed to her with a certain degree of diffidence as well as skepticism. At the Guernsey's book club's gathering,she chooses to read Anne Bronte: A Life,a work for which she harbours strong opinions instead of her more popular works.As opposed to the one dimensional Q&A session at the book launch, the act of reading out to the group is more intimate with several justified attacks and equally potent defenses, ultimately, proving that books do have the power to bring people across ages or from different geographical locations together.",The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society

186,jkennedy-60480,"Terrific storyline, wonderful cast and script, beautiful scenery and music.",10,9 September 2018,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. What can be better than a romantic story about books placed during an interesting historical period? And starring four actors who I came to love in Downton Abbey? I also loved charming Isola, adorable Kit and especially the charming young Eli, who has a wonderful smile and a great presence on camera and who we will hopefully see again soon. One minor thing I think the super talented writers missed: Eli switches between calling his grandfather ""Grandpa"" and ""Granddad."" But grandchildren don't interchange those words, because what they call their grandparent is really the same as his name. So he is either one or the other, but not both names. I was also less than enamored with the actor cast as Mark Reynolds. His eyes and his midwestern (?), gravelly accent were wearing on me. Michel Huisman was wonderful and I hope we see a lot more of him in the future as well. And I love everything Lily James does. I did think it was kind of funny in a trivial pursuit kind of way that this is the second movie/TV show where Lily James and Jessica Brown Findlay appear but never together.

The accomplished actors like Penelope Wilton and Tom Courtney created real characters. Forget hype and money. This is a great movie. Two days before, we went to see ""Crazy Rich Asians"" for our anniversary expecting to see an enjoyable romantic comedy. Instead we saw people who are probably good actors being abused by a movie with a bad script and insipid story (not plot).

222,christianfietz,The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society,7,29 April 2018,"It is not often that a beloved novel can be adapted so originally and yet so faithfully. A unique and rather wonderful experience. Juliet Ashton (Lily James) struggles under the trauma and horror of Post-World-War-Two London until a letter puts her into contact with Dawsey Adams (Michiel Huisman;) a member of the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society. Soon enough, she finds herself visiting the island and hearing the stories of comfort, love, horror and pure resilience from Guernsey's eccentric inhabitants. Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrows' novel, on which this is based, brought to life one of many untold stories from the War. That story being the NAZI occupation of the English Isles. Writing in the form of letters, it is easy to see how the novel became a personal exploration of the power of storytelling. Indeed, the literary society is a group of friends using reading and friendship as a means of escaping their war-torn situation. Newell is very aware of these powerful themes and works wonders to bring them to the screen. Much of the film is made up of Guernsey's characters recounting their stories to Juliet, accommodated by flashbacks. There is no minimum of truth poured into these tales to make them relevant and rather confronting. What ties them all together is the resilience of their friendship through these harsh times and what this raw bravery truly accomplished. Beside these recollections is an old-fashioned love and hope story. Juliet is quick to fall for the island of Guernsey and the friends she finds there. At a time when the people of Guernsey needed new love and support, she provides it with flair. In many ways, this is a story of finding hope out of trauma and love when you have nothing else left.Even the cinematography of the film resembles these morals. London is grey on the outside and artificially coloured in any delights in presents. Guernsey on the other hand, is presented with rolling mountains and mighty waves crashing against the shore. A breath of fresh air for Juliet and an opportunity for a new beginning for her as much as the society.Lily James balances realism, horror and hope in her performance as Juliet and her relationships with fellow actors are a credit to her talents. So many actors give wonderous performances that it would be impossible to name them all yet Jessica Brown Findlay needs acknowledging as Elizabeth. Her character serves as an arc of hope during the actual Occupation and she delivers marvellously. Perhaps the most original aspect of the film comes during the credits. Playing an audio-recording of a meeting of the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society brings the film back to its core roots and ties up the rest of the film to a nice conclusion. Wise, witty, confronting and yet full of heart, The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is a real and wonderful story. The only warning that must be advised to viewers: apparently potato peel pie is not as delightful as the film. Avoid consumption!",The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society

I had a feeling that I am waiting for more and that something big is going to happen. Then it gets better, interesting even, I'm still waiting for more,but I'm distracted by the beautiful scenery, beautiful people and good acting. The ending is really expected, predictable, but not unpleasant. I'm left with (at best) lukewarm feelings after watching it. Now,my strongest feelings were the sense of disappointment, how unfinished the characters were, You couldn't really get to know or like anyone. I liked the nutty gin lady the most, which is not how it suppose to be. The love story in this movie is without doubt the worst I have ever seen. This was a straight line, zero chemistry between the couple that should be in love. It was shocking, when she told him ""I'm in love with you"" or something...

231,nicholesauer,Book to film done well!,8,7 May 2019,"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is a Romantic, Historical Fiction book set on the Isle of Guernsey within a year of the German occupation of the isle ending. The book is written in an epistolary style, letters written back and forth between characters, which would not directly transition well to cinema. The screen writers had to take the images and details from those letters and re-create the interactions described to interactions happening. It may sound straight forward enough, but they had their work cut out for them. There are multiple times in the text that the setting was not clearly, or distinctly, described and actual dialog between characters was not given. They had the bones to an enchanting movie, but they had to put in the work to flesh it out for the cinema. Ultimately, while the setting is not exactly what was described in the book, the screen writers did a good job bringing this book to cinema.
Whenever a book is adapted to a movie there is an existing fan base that is holding its breath while the film is in production. What parts will be kept? What will be missing? Will they stay true to the characters and plot? Will they twist, turn, prune, or add in so much that you barely recognize the original story once it hits the big screen? Let's face it though, anytime you take an eight-hour or more story and condense it into a film to be watched in less than two hours, you are going to lose parts of it. The best book to film adaptations keep their characters true to the way they behaved in the book, adapt the story to shorten it without loosing critical content, and can build the same emotional response for viewers that the readers also enjoyed. The movie adaptation of this book was able to do all three of these things, some better than others.
The characters from the book are represented moderately well in the movie. Juliet is an author from London who is just finishing a book tour and not sure what to write next. She is written, and portrayed on film, as an infectiously charming, kind young women who is still figuring out what she wants out of life. Mark, whom is courting Juliet, is written as wealthy and domineering, he is also portrayed as the same in the movie.
There are characters whose demeanor is mildly, or majorly, different though. Dorsey, Juliet's first contact from the Isle of Guernsey, is written as a quiet man who stutters and struggles to express himself. He is portrayed in film without the stutter and with a much more outgoing personality. Amelia, a resident of Guernsey, in the book is a sweet and guarded, but overall a welcoming and kind women. Amelia in the movie has a gruff persona and it isn't until nearly the end of the film that you see her kinder, softer side. The film sadly does these characters injustice by not staying true to their text origins.
Any time you adapt a book to a film you must cut out content. This is where The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society film truly shines. The story is based around one character, Elizabeth, whom is the thread that links all the other characters together in the story. Much of Elizabeth's story is cut out in the film; sweet and charming tales of good deeds done, or tales or daring resistance in a troubling time. The screen writers left just enough of these that the viewers become attached to Elizabeth and can still tell that she is one to stand up for the weak and do what's right even when it's hard. It's a fine line to walk and the screen writers chose which parts of her story to share very well, while saving time and cutting out what wasn't absolutely necessary.
This movie does an excellent job of still creating the emotional reaction that readers get from the book. You become attached to the characters. Even with the movie cutting out much of Elizabeth's' back story, as well as other characters, viewers are still able to grow very fond of her and become saddened when they find out she had been executed. Mark is easy to dislike; the actor, Glenn Powell, did a splendid job portraying the books arrogant aristocratic persona. Viewers can also see and feel the budding attraction between Juliet and Dorsey, and will ultimately end up rooting for Juliet to stay with Dorsey instead of returning to London with Mark.
The pickiest of book to movie adaptation critics could argue that this movie adaption is missing out on too many things. The movie cuts out meeting a character whom Elizabeth was imprisoned with at a concentration camp, and the extra character development Elizabeth is given because of that time. The movie also misses out on a variety of small characters throughout the Isle of Guernsey which help to develop the feeling of community the book creates. There are story lines which are changed to create more drama in the film as some dramatic parts of the book, that weren't key points in the story, were cut out. For example, Juliet believes that Kit might be Dorsey and Elizabeth's child in the movie, but in the book it is clearly explained from the moment Kit is introduced that her father was a German solider.
It is a fact of book to film adaptations that the story will change, and some readers will be left disappointed with the film. If you are to enter the theater expecting changes though, I believe you will more thoroughly enjoy these adaptations. The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is a good example of a book to movie adaptation done right.",The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society

Theres a lot of characters, who would all have their own stories but none covered very well.I can't work out what the film really was supposed to be about... The events of the war, the aftermath, the society (which didn't really cover what happened in it), the writer, the writers history, the love story (x2 or 3), Guernsey, or the book (which wasn't clear what it was actually about)? It was just a bit of everything but a lot of nothing all strung together.This skimming just made it a bit hollow.. this often happens with a book adaptation, you can't do it all well.

I also think that the characters give a great performance and make you feel the scens. My favorite part was when this girl at the end understand the real porpuse of life and decides to finish what she had in London and start a new life of opportunities and stories to write in a new place with a real family.Something that I was not agree about it´s that because it is a history/romantic movie, the end is predictable but it´s a good one. I was waiting for the end that I imagine not to happen because it gave a big change in the last part when they were missing like 10 minutes but I think it was really cool, and I am happy for the end because I know the the main character made the best decision.I recommend it because it is a nice movie if you like romantic movies, and the plot was really cool. It is informative too, gives you part of the story when the Germans were in this country, how much they suffered, and how can you make something really cool even in hard moments.",The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society

In the movie, she had to research, she had to look into the news for knowing the stories and try hard to win their trust.There are lots of things I learned from the book, stories from the war and after the war, but the writing and the narration couldn't capture my emotion. I didn't even understand Elizabeth from the book.

Acting was very good. Congratulations to all involved on making such a good film. However, it is a pity that they chose to portray a Bible believing Christian as a judgemental bigot. I think it is so sad that so many films have this portrayal of Christians when in reality, true wartime experiences are full of wonderful, sacrificial, loving deeds of love and mercy shown by committed Christians. As far as I can tell, this character was not portrayed as such in the book. If they wanted a judgemental character they could have done that without making reference to her religion or the Bible. It seems like it was a way of making a cheap attack on Christians and their faith.",The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society

Going forward is my personal review of film.Never read the book? Well you should if you enjoyed the movie, trust me it is 100% better.All of the characters are so different and so much is missing. Like really important character parts! For example: where is Sidney's sister Sophia and Isola's Parrot Zenobia?! Sophia is a great friend of Juliet. What about the mention of Oscar Wild and Isola's funny story of being a 'great' detective.The only thing they got mostly right right the film is the fact that Juliet asked Dawsey to marry her!

The only thing that would have made it better would be if this story was fleshed out more in a mini television stories instead of abridged into a movie. I have not yet read the book, but I can't help but feel that many details and character development was left out due to time constraints. The movie tried its best, and I did enjoy the characters. However, I was left wanting to know more! We only got a small taste of all of their complexity, and I would have liked to savor the details of these characters longer to get to know them more. There are so many different backstories within this that are left untold.I'd like to know more about Amelia's family. What happened to her husband? Who was the father of Jane's baby, and what happened to him? What about Elizabeth's family? Wouldn't they also want Kit? What was Elizabeth and Christian's romance like in secret at the hospital?

Gradually, she comes to learn of the hardships, hunger and horrors that the people of Guernsey experienced during WW2.

Your heart will be torn to shreds. This movie took the menial, trivial parts of the book and put that at the focus instead of what the book leads us to know as the ultimate truth. Key characters were completely skipped over, and whole plots were added in that made the characters that were once strong and independent, flabby and frivolous.

291,alyssawahague,Lovely film and brilliantly cast,9,13 August 2018,"I read the book this was based on years ago so perhaps my fondness for it and the details have dimmed.
I watched it as soon as it hit Netflix and loved it so much, I watched it again the next day.
It certainly would be better served as a mini series for character development and to involve more of the original plot which was what made the book so entrancing.
I thought Lily James did a fine job considering how they wrote her storyline and considering who could've played the part (Kate Winslet, Rosamund Pike). Juliet was not a strong willed female lead like Jessica Brown Finlay's Elizabeth - who was not on the screen enough in my opinion. 
But the chemistry between Juliet and Dawsey is what kept me enthralled. The glances and longing looks and the moments (in the bar, his bedroom when Juliet finds the book she gave Dawsey, and right before her fiance Mark shows) are so charged with energy I found myself rooting for them and wanting to rewatch those scenes over and over. Michiel Husman brings an intoxicating presence to the screen in everything he does and I could not watch anyone else when he was on.
Matthew Goode's Sidney is hilarious and deserved more time and I really loved the rest of the cast which was SO well placed in their roles. It's a bit predictable towards the end but it's the ending I was hoping for so I was pleased.

It had deep and complex characters. It wasn't just your average love story wherein two people find each other. It was a love story about a community. How they loved, how they lost, how they survived and stayed strong. It was a love story about a woman finding out where she truly belonged and realizing who she wanted to be. It was a love story about finding unexpected family in people you barely knew. And of course, it was a love story of two people realizing what they meant to each other. So to save time, the writers mostly skipped to that last bit. And in doing so, they robbed ALL the female characters of their strength and confidence. They made them needy and reactive. Not just the lead; ALL of them. If you've not read the book, this movie is a cute and generic romance with all the typical elements Hollywood requires. Nothing memorable for good or ill.
