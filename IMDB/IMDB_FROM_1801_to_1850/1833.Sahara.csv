0,TheLittleSongbird,A solid adventure yarn and very underrated,8,2 September 2011,"I love adventure and action movies as much as the next person. Sahara is not the best I've seen, but there are worse out there. Clive Cussler's source material is a wonderful piece of work, and due to have more succinct writing and a more engaging story-the story here has alterations- is superior. But the film is a solid and underrated film in its own right.Plus I usually don't like comparing movies to their source material, to me they're different mediums and should be judged on their own merits..I often have heard and seen comparisons with the Indianna Jones movies, and that Sahara rips them off. I love those movies, well the first three anyway(fourth was mediocre) but to me while Sahara does have that vibe and like the Indy movies are adventure/action films they are all different and recommendable films in their own way.Sahara mayn't be perfect, while the script is mostly witty and the story exciting and engaging, there can be some disbelief in the dialogue and the film meanders at the end both in credibility and pacing.However, Sahara is visually stunning. I have seen many visually beautiful films, but with the majestic landscapes/settings and sparkling cinematography that has an epic sweep to it it is one of the more visually stunning films I've seen recently.The soundtrack is also very well done, fitting with both the tone and genre and memorable. The action is every bit as exciting as the story and well choreographed and the direction is solid. I thought the acting was fine on the most part, Matthew McConaughey has just the right charisma for the role, and Penelope Cruz is beautiful and suitably foxy.Steve Zahn has some great humorous lines and scenes and thankfully doesn't grate, William H. Macy is perfect here and likewise with a very enjoyable Lennie James. Delroy Lindo on the other hand is rather underused.Overall, solid, fun and underrated. Not perfect but better than some have said, at least in my view. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Sahara
1,bkoganbing,More Valuable Than Confederate Gold,7,23 March 2010,"Matthew McConaughey has developed into one of the bigger action/adventure stars over the last decade and its with films like Sahara that he's gotten that reputation. Thirty years ago I could have seen Clint Eastwood doing a film like this, sixty years ago it could have been John Wayne.Sahara finds McConaughey as a fellow more used to working on sea than on land, he's a salvage diver and one of the best. He's on the trail of one of those wildly improbable tales that you would find in pulp fiction adventure stories and the films made from them back in the day. A Merrimac type ironclad, captained by a friend of President Jefferson Davis sailed away with a whole treasure of Confederate gold just before the Civil War ended. Improbable because those ships were never meant for long ocean voyages, yet the legend has it that it made its way to Africa and sailed up the Niger River and is now somewhere in Mali, one of Africa's poorest developing countries.That's what he and sidekick Steve Zahn are after, but their paths cross that of Doctor Penelope Cruz with the World Health Organization seeking the cause of some strange new plague. The source is in the same neighborhood, so the two become allies and a bit more than that.Both also run afoul the local warlord Lennie James. Though he would no doubt love to find the treasure McConaughey is seeking, in Africa the medical supplies and knowledge of Cruz is far more valuable than gold. It's a commodity with a huge price tag.Sahara bears a close resemblance to the Indiana Jones films for both spectacle and pace. But the film also deals with some serious issues about the poorest of the earth's continents in the same vein as Blood Diamond. It's the kind of old fashioned story that Hollywood used to film on the studio back lots. No back lots here though, Sahara is filmed right on the Sahara, albeit in the far more stable country of Morocco.If you like the old fashioned kind of action/adventure film, Sahara is definitely one for you.",Sahara
2,Leofwine_draca,Read the book instead,4,3 August 2020,"Having recently read and enjoyed the Clive Cussler novel upon which this Hollywood blockbuster is based, I have to say that I'm entirely disappointed by a loose and lightweight adaptation which cuts out the majority of the good stuff. If I hadn't read the book beforehand I wouldn't have enjoyed it much either. Matthew McConaughey stars as Dirk Pitt, an adventurer who heads off into Mali in search of a legendary ship, only to run afoul of corrupt businessman and warmongering generals. It's made in a light, jokey way, with action scenes borrowing from Bond and Indiana Jones and poor direction throughout which robs the movie of style and enjoyable. Steve Zahn's character has been reduced to moronic comic relief while Penelope Cruz is there for eye candy alone. A far cry from the tough, gritty book, which is much more worth your time.",Sahara
3,SnoopyStyle,Fun cast in idiotic adventure movie,6,11 March 2015,"In the last days of the American Civil War, Confederate ironclad CSS Texas escape from Richmond with a treasure of wealth. In the present, WHO Dr. Eva Rojas (Penélope Cruz) is investigating a mysterious disease in west Africa. She is attacked and rescued by Dirk Pitt (Matthew McConaughey). He's a diving expert on a treasure hunt with his wacky sidekick Al Giordino (Steve Zahn). Admiral Jim Sandecker (William H. Macy) is the boss. Pitt believes that CSS Texas made it to the Niger river and Sandecker gives him with Giordino and Rudi Gunn (Rainn Wilson) 72 hours to investigate. Rojas and Dr. Hopper hitch a ride to Mali to investigate a possible outbreak.The Confederate ironclad idea is preposterous. The story is impossible. The plot is silly and full of convenient coincidences. The action is beyond ridiculous. The super evil secret base is worthy of a 007 movie. Yet the movie kind of works. I really like McConaughey as the lead. Zahn is fun. They are a breezy duo. Cruz is lovely. They are a great cast even in this meaningless dumb action adventure.",Sahara
4,Prismark10,Sahara,5,12 November 2019,"Sahara is a well made action adventure. Unfortunately it is not a great one despite the stars, location shooting and a lavish budget.Clive Cussler's literary character is no Indiana Jones despite the best efforts of the four credited writers.Dirk Pitt (Matthew McConaughey) is a diver and treasure hunter. He and his team are looking for an for an ironclad Civil War ship in the middle of the Sahara desert.Pitt rescues Dr Eva Rojas (Penelope Cruz) who works for the World Health Organization. She wants to investigate a possible outbreak of disease in Mali but someone is trying to stop her. The country is ravaged by civil war and there are dicey businessmen about.The story is all over the place. The finale is something out of a James Bond film. It is an uneasy mixture with little chemistry between Cruz and McConaughey.Sahara was meant to kickstart a franchise but was strangled at birth.",Sahara
5,claudio_carvalho,Good Adventure,7,22 January 2006,"I was in the mood of watching an adventure, and I decided to see ""Sahara"" and I liked. The story is about two treasure hunters, former mariners and great friends, Dirk Pitt (Matthew McConaughey) and Al Giordino (Steve Zahn), which go to Lagos seeking for a battleship from the American Civil that might be in Africa. They meet Dr. Eva Rojas (Penélope Cruz), a doctor of the World Health Organization that is trying to find the origin of a possible outbreak. They are attacked by the forces of a corrupt African dictator and an American entrepreneur and they join to the Tuaregs to find the truth.The story is silly, and I was curious to see Penélope Cruz in an action movie, and I was not disappointed. Steve Zahn gives the best funny moments, but something is missing in Matthew McConaughey to be an action hero like, for example, Harrison Ford and his Indiana Jones. Anyway, this movie entertains and I recommend it. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Sahara""",Sahara
6,kosmasp,What is it?,5,2 July 2007,"That's the question to ask here. Because if you think you're gonna see a light adventure movie in the same vain as let's say the Indiana Jones franchise, than you'll be surprised by the environmental issues it brings up. Those do heaven/burden the story and although I think that's a good/noble thing to do, it doesn't quite fit the bill here. The movie would've been better off, if it stayed on it's lighter side, exploring the comic relief/potential of one Steve Zahn, who'd make a great combo with Matthew M.But as I said, unfortunately, this movie hops from being serious to being silly too quickly and disappointingly enough, also without any real emotion. It's a fine line to juggle to genres ... and this movie doesn't succeed in doing so.",Sahara
7,jboothmillard,Sahara,5,7 April 2008,"To be honest, I wasn't paying the biggest amount of attention to every moment, but from what I did pay full attention it was quite an okay adventure story. Basically at the end of the Civil War in 1865 a battleship known as the ""Ship of Death"" loaded a large cargo of valuable golden coins sailed to Africa, but in a large storm and Tsunami it was buried in the sands of the Sahara. It is the job of treasure hunter Dirk Pitt (Matthew McConaughey) to find this ship and the treasure. Along with his lifelong buddy Al Giordino (Steve Zahn) and beautiful scientist Eva Rojas (Penélope Cruz) they set off on the adventure, with many people trying to stop them along the way. To be honest, it was mainly the chases, action and gun play that I paid attention to most, oh, and when they find the treasure. Also starring Lambert Wilson as Yves Massarde, Glynn Turman as Dr. Frank Hopper, Delroy Lindo as Carl, William H. Macy as Admiral Jim Sandecker, Rainn Wilson as Rudi Gunn, Lennie James as General Zateb Kazim and Patrick Malahide as Ambassador Polidori. Worth watching!",Sahara
8,rmax304823,"""I'll find the bomb. You get the girl.""",7,28 March 2014,"Once upon a time, the time being 1982, there was an action movie about an adventurer and his girl friend in varied exotic place searching for the Ark of the Covenant while pursued by Nazis. It was raucous, exciting, filled with unbelievable action and comedy. I mean, imagine a grown archaeologist running like hell down an underground corridor to escape a 150-ton rolling marble.It must have been wildly successful because Indiana Jones spawned two sequels and a dozen imitations, all sporting jungle or desert locations and searches for an idol's jeweled eye or something, sometimes a mummy.In this case, the adventurer and his comic sidekick, Matthew McCaughnahey and Steve Zahn, are marine salvage men and the girl, Penelope Cruz, is a doctor trying to halt the spread of an epidemic in Mali, a country ruled by dictator whose philosophy runs along the lines of, ""This is Africa. Nobody cares about Africa."" It's impossible to describe the plot, which is a Gordian knot and involves speedy action scene after hysterical action scene, lots of suspense, and just enough pauses for conversation to explain why the next exploit is going to take place. As in a skin flick, there's just enough fantastic plot to string the more interesting scenes together.I got rather a kick out of it. Everyone dashes around, shooting and diving into holes, discovering an ancient Confederate battleship in the middle of the Moroccan desert and finding that everything still works after 150 years of desuetude.The performances aren't as bad as you might expect, as long as you don't expect much. McConaughey and Zahn sink their teeth into these ridiculous roles, especially Zahn as the goofy young guy who utters the immortal line: ""I'll find the bomb; you get the girl."" Well, anyone named Zahn should sink his teeth into any role. Penelope Cruz as the humanistic but spirited doctor doesn't have much to do except look nice, and she accomplishes that without half trying. Yum.The award for best performance goes to Lennie James as the nonchalant and villainous antagonist in dreadlocks. The guy is frightening in his calculated and casual demeanor.The plot lost me towards the end. Something about destroying a vast dump of toxic waste. The life-and-death fist fights follow the usual dumb movie conventions. One combatant bumps his head against the other, as if there were no such thing as Newton's laws. And all the fights are gentlemanly, nothing like what we learned in boot camp, in which, if someone is trying to kill you, you flip out his eyeball with your thumb.But none of that counts for much. The sweeping landscapes are gaze magnets, and if the film wasn't shot in Mali, it sure looks like it was, what with its eroding towers and crumbling adobe villages. Mali may be he poorest country on the continent but it's picturesque and has a colorful history. Timbuktu is in Mali.",Sahara
9,ma-cortes,Splendid adventure film with mesmerizing desert landscapes,7,27 May 2005,"The film starts in the Richmond battle (1865) where a war ship is disappeared and is gone during modern time in that an archaeologists(Matthew McConaughey,Steve Zhan and William H.Macy) are looking for treasures on Africa. A physician (Penelope Cruz ) is investigating about an illness which is killing thousands people . Then they 'll take on ominous villains,evil Arabs,corrupt governments and many dangers until discover the enigmas. The motion picture blends adventures, unstopped action,humor,a love story,tongue in cheek,tense and is enough amusing. From the beginning to end the adventures,action-packed and the fast movement is continuous, for that the film is pretty bemusing and isn't boring in spite of the longtime, as the run is two hours and some. The starring couple(Matthew MacConaughey and Steve Zahn) make a type of ¨buddy movie¨ both are top notch and very sympathetic.Penelope Cruz is attractive and enjoyable, this is her best film. The support cast is of first range (William H.Macy,Lambert Wilson,Delroy Lindo) and are excellent. Cinematography and musical score(Clint Mansell) is magnificent and riveting. Production design (Allan Cameron) is spellbound and the Sahara outdoors are spectaculars. The final confrontation between the starring and the enemies is breathtaking and impressive. It's a run and mill action film where the comedy and the giggles united to the action make the story very agreeable and stimulating. The picture well directed by Brick Eisner obtained a lot of success and achieved important box office, it was number one in United States and Europe. It's a real blockbuster. The yarn will appeal to emotion and adventure enthusiasts . Rating: Above average. Well worth seeing.",Sahara
10,wes-connors,Rust in the Dust,5,23 May 2009,"""Scouring the ocean depths for treasure-laden shipwrecks is business as usual for a thrill-seeking underwater adventurer (Matthew McConaughey) and his wisecracking buddy (Steve Zahn). But when these two cross paths with a beautiful doctor (Penélope Cruz) they find themselves on the ultimate treasure hunt. Soon the three are in for the ride of their lives as they cross the blistering North African terrain pitting their skills against ruthless enemies bent on world destruction,"" according to the official synopsis.This film opens with a Civil War flashback and is dominated by 1970s oldies; but, it does take place in the present day Sahara Desert. The ship in the opening is the same one they find, later, in the desert, where rivers flowed in the 1860s; there, Mr. McConaughey (as Dirk Pitt) finds one of the rare coins issued by Confederate States President Jefferson Davis. The discovery of the ship, and ensuing shoot-out is exciting; but, the part with McConaughey and Mr. Zahn (as Al Giordino) happening upon Ms. Cruz (as Eva Rojas) in an old desert well is better.Treasure-hunting McConaughey sports an all too perfect tan. Childhood chum Zahn sums up his part with the line, ""I'll find the bomb, you get the girl."" Cruz is very attractive. Director Breck (son of Michael) Eisner shows competence and promise. Cinematographer Seamus McGarvey is probably the production team's most valuable player - as he makes the star and scenery look endlessly golden. Unfortunately, ""Sahara"" is a mostly vacuous film, interrupted with relatively unwarranted, albeit intensely exciting sequences.***** Sahara (4/4/05) Breck Eisner ~ Matthew McConaughey, Steve Zahn, Penélope Cruz, William H.

11,michaelRokeefe,Fearless treasure hunter saves the world.,6,14 September 2005,"Dirk Pitt(Matthew McConauhey)is a world renowned treasure hunter. His wise-cracking partner Al(Steve Zahn)have shared thrill-seeking dives for sunken treasure for almost forever. Pitt thwarts the attempted assassination of a humanitarian doctor(Penelope Cruz), who happened to be in North Africa checking on a possible epidemic. The olive complected, dark haired Eva Rojas(Cruz)joins Pitt and his partner take on ruthless, greedy men about to contaminate the world's waters and threatening destruction and the Earth's doom. Some very beautiful scenery and plenty of action and occasional violence makes SAHARA an interesting and enjoyable two hour escape from the real world. I didn't notice any sparks flying between McConauhey and Cruz hinting of their off screen relationship. But then again, I am definitely NOT a Penelope Cruz fan. Supporting cast features: Lambert Wilson, Glyn Turman, William H. Macy, Delroy Lindo and Rainn Wilson. Not as good as all the hype, but SAHARA is a very good adventure flick.",Sahara

13,hitchcockthelegend,Hey! How are yah?,7,6 September 2010,"Sahara is directed by Breck Eisner and loosely based on the best-selling book of the same name by Clive Cussler. It stars Matthew McConaughey, Steve Zahn, Penélope Cruz & William H. Macy. Plot sees McConaughey & Zahn as treasure hunters who whilst on the hunt for some Confederacy treasure get mixed up with a plague and an African dictator in Mali.Sahara is now considered one of the biggest financial failures of the modern cinema era. In spite of opening number one in America for its release, and making $18 million in the process, so much money went into production and distribution the film is thought to have lost around $80 million. Which while few of us have sympathy for stupid studios who throw silly money at projects, in this case it's unfair on the film itself.Oh for sure this is popcorn fodder fun, often silly and certainly confused as to where it thematically wants to go; outside of pitching for a franchise that is. But it's the kind of wholesome family adventure that Hollywood needs from time to time. It's not for nothing that sequels to Indiana Jones and The Mummy were churned out in the last decade, it's a niche in the movie market that needs filling during the family summer. But rarely do film makers get it right these days. Think Scorpion King, think Mummy 3, well Sahara is certainly five times better than both of those movies.All the elements for a sandy romp are in place here. A bronzed hero with comedy sidekick in tow, a pretty lady waiting to be romanced, and of course some villains who need a good kicking. Throw in a treasure seeking plot and some slam-bang action sequences and we are good to go. In the main that is. The film does suffer from weak villains and the plot is hardly one to interest younger viewers (enviromental disaster aversion and disease containment? Come on). But when the film begins to sag under the weight of its ""adult"" parts, Eisner has the nous to pull us back on track with another set piece or a bit of Zahn (a terrific film stealing turn) comedy. True enough that Cruz is just along for the ride and to act as an excuse for the agile McConaughey to get testosteroney, and with Paramount (at the time) boldly talking about sequels prior to release; we know these characters will survive, thus any ending peril is not going to bluff anyone. Still, are we really expecting anything else from a film led by a pearly toothed geezer called Dirk Pitt?. On another plus point, tho, it looks fabulous, especially in HD (Seamus McGarvey on cinematography), while Clint Mansell goes as Bondian as he can get away with for the score.It had a troubled past (it was beset with legal problems involving Paramount and Cussler), and that heavy financial loss has led many to believe it's a stinker to stay away from. However, it's really rather fun, propelled by great chemistry between McConaughey & Zahn and containing enough preposterous set pieces to fill out most other summer blockbusters. It's no Raiders (what is?), and its dumbness leaps out of the screen at frequent intervals, but it merrily zips along apace and safely brings the smiles as it goes. 6.5/10",Sahara
14,dbborroughs,A Great Guilty Pleasure Movie,9,10 April 2005,"I'm a big fan of the Dirk Pitt novels. I've read most of them even when they were awful because the interaction of the heroes was always so much fun. For me any success of film adaption was going to rest on how well Dirk and Al were cast and played. Aside from Al being a bit too goofy the film makers have found the perfect casting in Matthew McConaughey and Steve Zahan, these two are destined for screen team greatness if author Clive Cussler allows there to be another outing.The two-fold plot has Pitt looking for a Civil War Ironclad in the African desert while a doctor tries to find the source of an unknown epidemic that is beginning to kill people. The two stories of course collide as our heroes must step in to first save the doctor before saving the world at large. Its a rip roaring slam bang adventure of the sort they don't make any more.This is the type of movie that you go to get away from it all. Its not heavy or earth shaking, but its wonderfully distracting. Go see it. If you can give yourself over to it you'll have a great time.",Sahara
15,lastliberal,I think we need to pull a Panama!,7,1 June 2007,"I read Clive Cussler's NUMA stories a long time ago. I quit when Dirk Pitt retired. I knew Dirk Pitt, and Matthew McConaughey is no Dirk Pitt! I like Penélope Cruz, and she made a great WHO doctor. I like William H. Macy, and he made a good Admiral Jim Sandecker. I like Delroy Lindo and he was good also. But, Matthew McConaughey was totally unbelievable as Dirk Pitt and I suspect was put in the film to appeal to teens.So, did that ruin the movie? Not really. It could have been much better with another actor, but is was still a good action movie and the cinematography was outstanding.Worth a view.",Sahara
16,zardoz-13,It's The Pitts for Clive Cussler,4,18 June 2007,"Bestselling novelist Clive Cussler should have known better than to trust Hollywood to make another of his exciting, sea-going yarns about Dirk Pitt into a movie. The first Pitt cliffhanger, ""Raise the Titanic"" (1980), tanked so badly at the box office that it actually hurt sales of Cussler's literary franchise. Twenty-five years after that fiasco, Cussler must have felt confident that the time was right to give his larger-than-life hero a second chance. Evidently, something went awry somewhere in the mix, because Cussler is currently suing the producers. He says that they promised him script approval then ignored him. Despite a first-rate cast, top-lining Matthew McConaughey, Stephen Zahn, and sexy Penelope Cruz, along with some scenic Moroccan locales, ""Sahara"" amounts to nothing more than a noisy, episodic, run-of-the-thrill, $120-million potboiler. This second-rate, sun-scorched saga serves up more amusing lightweight moments than heavyweight melodramatic face-offs. The hopelessly over-plotted screenplay concocted by four scribes (newcomers Thomas Dean Donnelly & Joshua Oppenheimer as well as John C. Richards of ""Nurse Betty"" and James V. Hart of ""Laura Croft, Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life"") recycles all the usual action movie clichés and never deviates from the standard-issue, derring-do formula. For example, a henchman with a sniper rifle cannot nail a good guy charging toward him across open terrain! Armed with shell-spewing automatic weapons, the other heavies are incredibly sorry shots. Nobody but the heroes here can hit the side of a sand dune. Usually, audiences must suspend their disbelief to make it through a James Bond extravaganza or Indiana Jones epic, but ""Sahara"" gives new meaning to preposterous. Were that not bad enough, the chief villains emerge as ordinary, ineffectual ruffians. They pose either no tangible threat or such a marginal dramatic menace that we know our long-suffering heroes will vanquish them. When the villains lack magnitude, then the heroes lack stature. Villains make or break action movies, and the villains here have only half as much screen time as the heroes.""Sahara"" opens with a bang in the year 1865 during the final days of the Civil War. The pyrotechnics in this scene surpass anything that follows. As the Union Army bombards Richmond, Virginia, the Confederate capital, the rebels load a fortune in gold coins aboard the C.S.S. ironclad Texas. Miraculously, the ironclad slips through the Federal blockade and vanishes without a trace. Some 140 years after the mysterious disappearance of the Texas, an ex-U.S. Navy Seal, Dirk Pitt (Matthew McConaughey of ""Reign of Fire""), embarks on an obsessive search for the missing vessel. When he isn't pursuing leads on the Texas, Pitt works as a jack-of-all-trades, deep-sea diving daredevil for retired U.S. Navy Admiral James Sandecker (the ever dependable William H. Macey of ""Cellular"") who presides over a private maritime salvage outfit called the National Underwater Marine Agency (NUMA). When we first meet Pitt, Sandecker, and Pitt's perennial comic sidekick Al Giordino (Steve Zahn of ""National Security""), our trio of treasure hunters are pulling an African artifact off the ocean floor near Nigeria, for Yves Massarde (Lambert Wilson of ""The Matrix Reloaded"") a wealthy French industrialist. Meanwhile, in a separate plot, two World Health Organization doctors, Eva Rojas (Penelope Cruz of ""Blow"") and Frank Hopper (Glynn Turman of ""Light It Up""), discover a deadly infectious plague. When Eva investigates, she places herself in jeopardy. Three thugs working for a bloodthirsty African warlord, General Kazim (Lennie James of ""Snatch"") who has a taste for rare autos and antique firearms, manhandle Eve on a beach. Since he happens to be snorkeling nearby, Pitt intervenes and delivers Eva from their evil clutches. After she has recovered from the incident, Admiral Sandecker agrees to let Frank and her hitch a ride with Pitt and Giordino on a NUMA yacht into war-torn Mali where Pitt is tracking down his latest lead on the Texas. Sandecker has given Pitt three days to find his fabled ironclad. It seems that our hero found one of those CSA twenty dollar gold coins in a nearby African town. Naturally, our heroes collide with the ruthless general and his trigger-happy minions. Mind you, this synopsis covers only the first third of an action-thriller overloaded with exposition.The worse thing about ""Sahara"" is that our heroes yap more than scrap. The bullets begin to fly about forty minutes or so into the modern day fracas. Although Eva and Dirk fight alongside each other, the sparks never fly between them. McConaughey and Cruz aren't allowed to smooch until they've dispatched the villains and saved the world from an environmental cataclysm. Not surprisingly, every character in ""Sahara"" qualifies as a stereotype. The scruffy, lovable Zahn steals the show with his witticisms and his butt-crack antics, while McConaughey hurls his brawny, buffed-up, deeply-tanned physique into one predicament after another. The charismatic McConaughey acquits himself well enough as an action figure, but his Dirk Pitt makes little impression as the hero of a proposed franchise. Unlike Cussler's larger-than-life literary hero, McConaughey's Pitt comes off as a colorless cross-between of James Bond and Angus MacGyver. In a crowd of cinematic heroes, Dirk Pitt just doesn't stand out. One minute Cruz's Eva behaves like a dainty, bespectacled doctor but the next minute she blasts away with a sub-machine gun like a gangster and straddles a camel as if to the saddle born. First-time helmer Breck Eisner (son of former Disney honcho Michael Eisner) directs with solid proficiency but little flair. He sticks to basics in the combat scenes. You've seen the boat chases, helicopter/car chase, and the shoot outs staged with greater ingenuity in better movies. Clocking in at over two hours, Eisner could have eliminated thirty minutes. He shepherds ""Sahara"" along at a leisurely pace as if urgency weren't a priority. Civil War buffs won't be fooled for an instant that anything like what ""Sahara"" conjures up could have occurred. Nowhere near as entertaining as the vastly superior ""National Treasure,"" ""Sahara"" shares more similarities with the sprawling desert from which it draws it name.",Sahara
17,grantss,Dumb,3,12 May 2015,"Dumb. Initial plot was interesting, and there were one or two good action sequences, but that's it. Rest of the movie is incredibly crap. Random plot, far-fetched action, very stupid dialogue.The fact that Steve Zahn appears in this should be enough to tell you this is not going to be a good movie. He is clueless, and only gets crap movies. This is pretty much a standard role for Matthew McConaughey, before he started acting in serious movies.Penelope Cruz deserves better (though I didn't mind seeing her at all!). You feel sorry for her, having to recite incredibly dumb lines when you know she is capable of much better roles and performances.I enjoyed the Clive Cussler / Dirk Pitt books as a kid. This movie may have just put me off them.",Sahara
18,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Can we borrow your car?,6,25 December 2012,"Dirk ""Arm"" Pitt(...OK, I added the middle name) works for NUMA(not related to that internet meme several years back), finding and raising artefacts of ages past from under the sea(and... elsewhere?). He has a friend, Al, for ""comic"" relief(surprisingly not as obnoxious as you'd expect(only some quirk in this), although do note that there is not a single funny joke in this... here's an example: there's a running gag about him losing his hat. Yeah). They are not at all credible as ex-military(all the mêlée fighting is unconvincing), albeit it's nice that they know what they're doing as far as surfacing stuff goes, and it does feel like these people(not only our two male leads) have history together. Anyway, they're going after The Texas, a US battleship from the 1860's(not the only civil war in this... and it's worth noting that this is respectful towards other cultures), whilst aiding Dr. Who... no, wait... a doctor working for WHO(Cruz, who tends to be at her most sexualized when a damsel in distress and/or we're meant to worry about her being the victim of violence... that's... appropriate; on the plus side, she does get to be important), that's it in trying to find the source of a possible epidemic in Africa. How did they meet? His abs save her from what I can only describe as desert ninjas(they're deadly, you know). Oh, and meanwhile, their boss, ex-admiral Sandecker(Macy, never bad) tries to help them from his end. Given that I got 4-6 hours less sleep last night than usual, I figured that my brain was appropriately close to outright turning off for me to watch a movie starring both Zahn *and* McConaughey. That didn't make the prospect any more appealing, however. While I have not read any of the books, I am quite happy that this did not start a series of adaptations of them, as it was intended. Once again, the casting is wrong for the genre(it's like when Ben Affleck is to be taken seriously in this kind of role... just, please, give it up). It's preposterous(simultaneously being dumb and making you ask too many questions, not even about logic, but about why someone is doing what they're doing, and what the actual resolution to this plot element was), pure Hollywood, and at 113 minutes(sans credits, or 119 with), overlong. On the plus side, it works decently as swashbuckling action flick(leading up to a pretty cool climax), with exciting sequences(shootouts and chases) and some effective tension. It's filmed well, and the soundtrack has great classic rock. The FX are almost all practical, and it has the usual benefit, it comes off more real, there's weight to it. The DVD comes with three documentaries that I will review on their separate pages here on the site(the 20 minute Visualizing Sahara, 15 minute Across the Sands of Sahara and 10 minute Making Sahara), 4 and a half minutes of deleted scenes with optional commentary by director and star and trailers for The Brothers Grimm, The Wedding Date, Danny the Dog and Ambulancen. I recommend this to anyone desperately looking for an Indiana Jones rip-off(presuming you've already watched the Librarian franchise). 6/10",Sahara

Rambunctious hodgepodge action-adventure popcorn flick with McConaughey cast as Dirk Pitt, an adventurer/explorer for hire whose quest to find a 150 year old Confederate Ironclad ship leads him to the unlikely titular destination where he encounters a diabolical plot involving a Eurotrash industrialist (Lambert cornering the cottage industry of said villainy of late) and a deadly plague being questioned by a plucky UN doctor (a seemingly miscast Cruz despite her loveliness) determined to expose it globally. Based on Clive Cussler's popular novel  and a powder keg-like attempt to spark a new film franchise  adapted by four screen scribes results in a divertingly entertaining yet lunk-headed half-baked storyline that gets silly as it progresses in this poor-man's attempt for an Indiana Jones for the 21st century. Zahn as always steals the show as McConaughey's amiably doofus sidekick. (Dir: Breck Eisner)",Sahara
20,FlashCallahan,"Like the titular desert, too long and barren....",5,28 May 2015,"Searching for a treasure on the River Niger, Dirk Pitt stops the attempted assassination of a W.H.O. scientist investigating a disease that is killing thousands of North Africans. The suspected cause of the raging epidemic is vast, unprecedented pollution that threatens to end all life in the world's seas. Racing to save the world from environmental catastrophe, Pitt and his team run a gauntlet between a billionaire French industrialist and a bloodthirsty West African tyrant. In the desert, Pitt uncovers the truth behind his life-long quest - the fate of a Civil War ironclad. Now, amidst the blazing, shifting sands of the Sahara, Pitt will make a desperate stand......Sometimes when a summer movie comes along, you can just tell it's going to bomb from the upstart. The trailer was boring, the one sheet showed all the stars looking smug and pleased with themselves, and the biggest mistake it could have made, thinking that it could be the next big franchise.When there are talks about a fourth Indiana Jones movie in the works, don't release a similar movie based on a best selling series of novels, because it's going to get way too much more coverage than it deserves, and then the flaws with the film begin to show rapidly.Firstly, it's way too long, by a good twenty minutes. If you took out most of the shots with McConaughy smiling and looking smug, the run time would be a lot slimmer, so the action would feel a lot more taught.The soundtrack is just a little too wacky for the film, in fact, the wacky scenes in the film just feel so out of place, when the main villain is some maniacal dictator who really is a sinister being. The humour is tepid and bland, and the running joke regarding the boat just makes Macy seem like some whining queen.Cruz is at her lowest point here, literally the love interest, and eye candy for the bored gents in the audience.It's too violent to be a family film, too long to be as exciting as it should, and the comedic moments really drag the film down.Dirk Pitt? Now, what's that word that rhymes with Pitt?",Sahara
21,Aaron1375,Great action adventure in the sands of the Sahara.,9,2 September 2005,"I rather liked this movie about a salvager and his buddy looking for a old civil war vessel and helping a doctor track down the source of a really deadly disease in Africa. I sort of compare it to ""National Treasure"", but I liked this one a bit more because it was more action oriented. I also always find Steve Zahn humorous and it is nice to see the comedy relief guy actually be a competent aid rather than a complete klutz as well. Matthew McConaughey is also good in the lead role as is Penelope Cruz. Starts out kind of slow, but once the boat chase occurs the movie goes into full throttle and it is nonstop action and humor. Of course this movie is based on a book and I am guessing that the book is a bit old as the source of the sickness seems more like something from the 1980's rather than 2005. I am not going to complain though as this movie was for me fun to watch. There were a couple of nice twists as well though you will know one of the villains the moment you see them. So give it a look see and you might enjoy it as much as me, even if you don't you probably at least will not be bored. Also, there is a great climatic action scene that is just great.",Sahara
22,Wuchakk,Worthwhile Indiana Jones/James Bond Hybrid,5,11 March 2014,"""Sahara"" is an Indiana Jones/James Bond hybrid that should be appreciated by fans of, say, ""National Treasure"" and ""The Mummy"" (1999), though it's not quite as good as either of those films.I was hoping it would be closer to the Clive Cussler novel, but the main elements of the story are there. Matthew McConaughey makes a decent enough Dirk Pitt (Cussler's hero in his book series), although I envisioned him with broader shoulders and facial features more akin to Charles Bronson. Steve Zahn doesn't physically look like his sidekick Al Giordino (who is supposed to resemble a human bulldozer), but I enjoyed Zahn in the role. Penelope Cruz is also enjoyable as the W.H.O doctor.I'm a sucker for desert-adventure flicks (e.g. ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" ""Flight of the Phoenix,"" ""The Mummy,"" ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" etc.) and so really enjoyed the great desert scenery (from locations in Morocco and Spain).So why only a grade of C+? Mainly because the flick doesn't match the greatness of the novel, but also because of the many implausibilities (e.g. the escape from the pick-up truck, the absurd entrance into the desert facility, the soccer ball incident, just to name a few). In other words, the film often has an unrealisitic tone. Still, I enjoyed the fun, upbeat spirit of ""Sahara,"" similar to Indiana Jones or the 70s/early 80's James bond flicks.If you haven't read the book it would be more like a grade of B.GRADE: C+",Sahara
23,gradyharp,A Dandy Summer Popcorn Movie,7,31 August 2005,"SAHARA is one of those films to view when escapism is the goal of the evening. Made along the same lines as the 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' genre, mixing adventure with comedy, a smattering of love interest, a dollop of social comment, and some pretty fine scenery that creates a stage for likable actors such as Matthew McConaughey, Steve Zahn, Penelope Cruz, William H. Macy, Delroy Lindo, and Lambert Wilson, SAHARA succeeds in pulling off an interesting caper film.Not having read the apparently sacrosanct novel by Clive Cussler upon which the film is based, this 2 hour plus film seemed to putt along without any great shakes, without much in the way of character development, without any hint of screen chemistry between Cruz and McConaughey, but with the surprise pleasure of watching Steve Zahn steal the scenes with his comic talent. It is that kind of film - not to be taken seriously or valued higher than its intent. It is just entertainment - and there is nothing wrong with that! Grady Harp",Sahara
24,mm-39,Not a bad movie,6,1 May 2005,"Watching the preview I did not know if I wanted to see this movie. After listening to much whining at work, leaving early on a Friday, my wife and I caught the late show. Not bad, the beginning is strong, and the middle is funny. The last quarter fades, and the film's direction is fantasy oriented. Probably a better book than film. Matthew is going be a great supporting actor, only time will tell if Matthew will hit it big. He is a 80's version of James Wood. A fine actor for certain parts. Fraility was Matthew's best. A relaxing stress release of escapism. Believe me I needed it. A Star Wars or Raiders type of escapism no, but a good second movie on rental night. 6 or 7 out of 10 depends on one's mood. Pulls no punches with the Hollywood PC stuff dare to be different. I like the ship out in the middle of the desert idea.",Sahara
25,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Sahara,8,9 April 2005,"The trailer of this film does not do it any justice, as it presented this film like another rehash of Nicholas Cage's National Treasure, given the success of that film at the box office.While this show is somewhat a treasure hunt adventure, the focus is far from that, as it manages to put in many different subplots and mix them well together, even though each subplot takes up little screen time. You have two treasure hunters (Matthew McConaughey and Steve Zahn), a World Health Organization doctor (Penelope Cruz), Mali warlords, a French industralist (our favourite Matrix Merovingian without the exaggerated French accent), with plots about pollution and toxic waste, a Civil War era iron ship, feuding factions, shady clandestine organizations and treasure hunting.Based upon a Clive Cussler novel, the feel of the movie is like an Indiana Jones adventure, with interesting and sometimes comedic action sequences, its own catchy Dirk musical theme (that could be a mainstay if this show has its own franchise), a capable sidekick who provides the laughs, and even makes subtle digs at Indiana Jone's penchant for not losing his fedora hat.I've never watched a Matthew McConaughey flick since his major debut in A Time To Kill (also based on a novel, by John Grisham), and if this movie proves successful, he might be on his way to a new movie franchise. Steve Zahn manages to bring across the comedy with uncanny timing, and Penelope Cruz, well, what more can I say? If you enjoyed National Treasure, don't let the trailer fool you into thinking that this show is similar. It's more.",Sahara

27,sddavis63,Intriguing Action Movie With Good Performances,7,28 October 2008,"Action/adventure movies have to have more than action and adventure in order to work - otherwise they just end up being pale copies of each other with only minor variations. At the very least, they need an intriguing story line and good performances. On those counts, ""Sahara"" works pretty well. Admittedly, at first glance this would appear to be something of a ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" clone, with the emphasis on treasure hunting. However, once it gets going it's far more intriguing, and, of course, with a more modern flair to it. It's about the quest for a Confederate ironclad that ran the Union blockade in the last days of the Civil War and is now inexplicably reputed to be buried in the sands of the Sahara. How it got there is one mystery in the movie. That story ends up being linked with a mysterious plague that's starting to spread in northwest Africa, and finally with a potential environmental catastrophe that needs to be stopped. The three stories blend together very well. Being set in modern Africa also allows for some consideration of the problem of ""warlordism"" that still afflicts parts of that continent. So, the story works.So do the performances. I'm not a huge fan of Matthew McConnaughy to be honest, but he was very good as Dirk Pitt, the leader of the expedition looking for the ironclad, and he was complemented very nicely by Steve Zahn as his sidekick Al. The two shared some witty dialogue and both were well partnered with Penelope Cruz as the doctor from the World Health Organization who's investigating the plague and, in a somewhat lesser role, by Rainn Wilson as Rudi, a fellow adventurer. Also featured fairly prominently (although most of his scenes were his own; he wasn't in partnership too much with the others) was William H. Macy as Dirk's boss.It's what you'd expect in such a movie in terms of adventure and action, but the intrigue in the storyline and good performances raise it up a notch or two. 7/10",Sahara
28,Buddy-51,second-rate action thriller,4,23 November 2005,"In ""Sahara,"" Matthew McConaughey plays an archaeologist/adventurist with a bit of a quixotic streak (he even has his own Sancho Panza-type comic relief sidekick to accompany him on his adventures) and a full-on action-hero name (Dirk Pitt). Dirk's impossible dream - get this - involves finding and salvaging an ironclad ship from the American Civil War that he believes somehow made its way across the entire Atlantic Ocean before it sank in a river in Africa! In his search for the unlikely relic, Dirk soon finds himself knee deep in trouble, trying to make his way through a country ruled by a vicious, bloodthirsty warlord and torn asunder by chaos. Penelope Cruz plays a World Health Organization official determined to enter the country to help stave off a plague that seems to be taking hold there. The two of them, both with markedly different motives, wind up joining forces as they take on the murderous thugs and corrupt officials who are determined to stop them from reaching their goals.""Sahara"" is one of those movies in which a bunch of beautiful people wisecrack their way through one death-defying adventure after another - with an occasional time out for platonic romance and a moment or two of social conscience. The problem here, though, is that the humor is pretty wan overall and the action sequences strictly standard-issue in nature. The acting, too, is pretty shallow, with McConaughey spending most of his time flexing his muscles, and Cruz making the most glamorous and least convincing ambassador of goodwill to a third world country since Angelina Jolie tried the same stunt a few years back. And, of course, as is the case with so many of these films, ""Sahara"" reduces complex geopolitical realities to little more than simpleminded melodramatic clichés.As the movie drags on, the plot becomes more and more ridiculous at every turn and the stunts more and more over-the-top, with the whole shebang culminating in one of those hail-to-Dorothy-the-Wicked-Witch-is-dead - type endings that is as corny as it is preposterous. Chances are, though, that you'll have dusted off the sands of ""Sahara"" long before that point.",Sahara
29,cherold,tedious first half,5,6 October 2013,"It's possible that something interesting happens in the second half of this movie, but life is short and I was so bored by the halfway point that I can't tell you if that's true. I can say that the first half features a bland protagonist, a vaguely amusing friend and what looks like a love interest in spite of no sign of chemistry. I can tell you there is some pretty scenery and that the action scenes aren't exciting. I can't believe people are comparing this with Raiders of the Lost Ark. What similarities are there? Some desert? People with guns? Where's a dashing hero, a sense of style, an engaging story, dynamic action? I mean seriously, unless the only action movie you've ever seen before is Raiders, you couldn't possibly think this was like it.Really, in spite of the expensive scenery, it feels more like a low-budget buddy picture from the 1970s.",Sahara

They cross paths with a UN doctor, Eva Rojas (Penelope Cruz), looking for the source of a mysterious African plague. They eventually agree to work together but are thwarted at every turn by a ruthless warlord who wants neither to succeed.If you look up the definition of ""popcorn movie"" in the dictionary, it should just read ""See Sahara"". The plot is ludicrous, the explosions are numerous, the action rarely lets up, and the one-liners are ever present. In short, Sahara is one fun film. The acting is better than you'd expect from a movie like this. McConaughey, Zahn, and Cruz are all more than capable of carrying a movie on their own. Combined, they're a real treat to watch. The cinematography is often quite stunning. The West African landscapes are gorgeous. Another plus for me is that Sahara is fairly family friendly. It's the kind of movie I can watch with my 7 year-old and not worry. If I've got one complaint, at over 2 hours, it runs a bit long. Editing out about 10 - 15 minutes would have made Sahara a real winner.I understand that had Sahara done better at the box office, it might have led to a whole Dirk Pitt series of movies.

31,Robert_duder,Typical but good action film,8,5 September 2005,"I'm not sure I would ever compare Sahara to the likes of Indiana Jones although I think new action hero Dirk Pitt could become his own brand of adventure. Sahara brings nothing new to the table at all which doesn't mean it's not worth seeing. On the contrary it's a rip roaring action adventure in the likes of Flight of The Phoenix and National Treasure. The only downfall to it is it's typical recipe and being extremely predictable.The saving grace to the film is it's exotic setting, and very decent cast. Matthew McConaughey as the lead actor and adventurer Dirk Pitt does a good job. He's rugged and very American and plays his usual type of character which makes him fun to watch and he's got a bit of a serious and dangerous side to his character. Who knew that action films would fit Penélope Cruz so well. Cruz plays the lead female Dr. Eva Rojas who is searching for the source of a seemingly deadly plague that is killing patients across Africa. Her English has improved drastically since the last film I saw her in and for the first time she seems comfortable in a role and in her speaking. The stand out performance in Sahara is from supposed supporting cast mate Steve Zahn. He really handles his screen time like a lead actor and is far less geeky than he usually is in his roles. McConaughey and him have that great buddy charisma that is so important for a buddy type film but both have them have star quality which is great and Zahn doesn't take a backseat to McConaughey by any means. If anything he ends up being the bigger adventurer. Sahara could not be the same without his character and that's saying something. And on top of that he gets all his usual and hilarious sarcasm!! As with all action films of this type the implausible is a necessary aspect. When watching any action film let alone action adventure you need to check reality at the door. So many people who hate this film and films like it argue about the impossible but that's what this genre is all about. We don't wanna see reality. Of course a 150 year old cannon is not likely to work but it fits the story. Of course bullets are gonna fly but the heroes are never gonna get hit. It's all about the adventure!! Sahara is enjoyable but mostly the same as you've seen before, I don't think it's mind blowing but it's worth seeing for what it is. And for the future I would love to see a sequel because I am all about sequels even if they never capture the original magic!! 8/10",Sahara
32,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,A little boring and meandering but a very classy presentation,7,11 September 2005,"STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits Adventurer Dirk Pitt (Matthew McCoughnehey) travels to Nigeria, Africa to retrieve an ancient battleship. However, he stumbles upon a travesty. The people are dying or terribly diseased because of polluted water from the wells. There is, of course, a more insidious reason for this: the typically corrupt African government and a plot that spreads all the way to the States. Pitt, his sidekick and Eva (Penelope Cruz) a beautiful doctor determined to stop the spread of the disease, must battle to save the day.Sahara is a slick, glossy effort that has a pleasingly polished feel all the way. It has a neat soundtrack and some fairly exciting action sequences. But, fun as they are, there's not nearly enough of them and the disappointing lack of action leaves the film to get a little boring along with the wavey plot that meanders about a bit for two hours.McCoughnehey isn't my favourite leading man. A bit too smug and coy for my liking. His sidekick is little more than your typical wise-cracking Hollywood fall guy and similarly Cruz can do little more than be the usual steely, determined love interest you see in films like this. As for the rest of the supporting cast, William H Macy is pleasing but Delroy Lindo gets hardly any screen-time in his role.A film with some serious flaws, but still a fairly enjoyable piece of Sunday afternoon BBC 1 entertainment. ***",Sahara
33,MOscarbradley,A case of too many cooks over-egging the pudding,5,14 April 2008,"You may be forgiven if, when ""Sahara"" is over, you still haven't figured out the exact details of the plot since, in this sub-Indiana Jones style adventure, the plot is hardly the thing. You may also wonder how it took four scriptwriters to come up with the nonsense on screen or maybe it was just a case of too many cooks spoiling the broth. Still, it isn't a total write-off. It looks great, (big wide screen, African locations and Matthew McConaughey flashing his pecs and his killer, if ingratiating, smile at us; after a while that smile starts to set our teeth on edge).The action sequences, and they are plenty, are handled with aplomb and it fairly races along. But it never rises above the second-rate. That business with the plot is a major drawback, (it tries to cobble together two distinctly separate plots, losing both of them in the confusion), the acting is weak and we've seen it all before. It isn't the worst film ever made but it's hardly in the Spielberg league either.",Sahara
34,bowmanblue,A good film ruined by a book,7,7 March 2015,"First of all, let me say that I have never even heard of the book that 'Sahara' is based on. I have no idea how accurate the film is, or whether the actors portraying the characters are doing a good job. In fact, I've never even heard of the author of these - apparently famous - books (sometimes, I wonder whether I've actually read anything other than 'Mr Man' books).However, apparently I'm in a minority, because whatever books Sahara is based on are actually pretty famous. And that's where the problem lies. According to (almost) everyone who has read the book and then went on to see the film, the film bears no resemblance to the source material and it a total poke-in-the-eye of the book that so many love.Hence Sahara got one hell of a rough ride when it was released. The producers made no secret about the fact that they were hoping for a success to then go and green-light the many sequels. But that's never going to happen now.But, as I've already said, I haven't read the books, so I'm basing my judgement on the film through and through. And I rather liked it. Yes, it's not that complex. Goodies and baddies are easily defined and the hero saved the planet, gets the girl and finds some treasure for good measure. But it's a family film, so why shouldn't good come through in the end? Many people draw comparisons with the Indiana Jones movies. No, Sahara will never be as good as an 'Indy' outing, but it's in the same mould of rip-roaring adventures (think more 'The Mummy' but with no supernatural element).If you want deep narrative structure and excellent character developments then look elsewhere. However, if you want a fun popcorn movie to watch with the kids on a Saturday afternoon, then give Dirk Pitt a go (and never open one of the books it's based on... ever).",Sahara
35,dromasca,an action movie that tries to be more but does not succeed really,5,28 January 2006,"Clive Cussner's book is brought to screen by first time director Breck Esner, and the result is intriguing, but not really interesting or captivating, in my opinion. I was told that the book is 700 pages plus, and has a richness of characters which does not really come across on the screen. What does come across is a totally unbelievable story of a US Civil War ship being found 150 years after in the mid of Sahara from all places, carried there by some kind of change of climate. The lack of credibility of the whole story as a whole and in almost every detail and every scene is too visible not to be intentional. The cinematographic treatment of it is however too weak to back the approach. The filming in Sahara is beautiful, but the effects are rather cheap, reminding movies from the 70s of a kind that ended with Indiana Jones, which actually seems to be the direct source of inspiration of the film and of its characters. Acting is also on the verge of the comics, with the Matthew McConaughey and Steve Zahn couple in the main roles doing a fair job but lacking the charisma of a Harrison Ford and with Penelope Cruz trying probably to make one of the mandatory blockbuster films in any good cinema actress career, but choosing the wrong production for this purpose. Overall, it's not a bad film, it really tries hard to be different and leave an impression, but fails slightly both at the cinema art as well as at entertainment level.",Sahara

Sahara seemed like another attempt to create an adventure franchise in the mold of the Indiana Jones films. However, it fails to be any where near as good. The story was not good enough and all the comedy parts fell flat. I never laughed. I like adventure movies when done right, but I liked National Treasure another adventure film that came out last year much better.In this, the badies are dumping toxic waste in the desert. That wasn't real original. And Penelope Cruz has the only female role. Too bad you couldn't understand what she says through that thick accent. There is a boat chase scene that wasn't original. Probably the best scene was Dirk's and Al's escape from the back of a truck.Overall the film just needed to be more entertaining and more original.

38,CuriosityKilledShawn,Mildly entertaining no-brainer with no soul,6,6 November 2005,"Yes, Sahara does take place in the same universe as the monumental flop Raise the Titanic, a universe where the Titanic sunk in one piece. Keep your eyes open during the opening credits and you'll see a newspaper clipping of the ship being towed into New York.Matthew McConaughey takes over the role of Dirk Pitt from Richard Jordan (whoever he is) and teams up with Steve Zahn and Penelope Cruise for a film that should offer much more action and excitement than Raise the Titanic offered. It's doesn't really succeed.Dirk Pitt and his pal Al Giordino are professional divers/explorers who sneak off from their ordinary salvage duties to find a legendary ship packed full of treasure in a warn-torn part of Africa. Penelope Cruz is a W.H.O. doctor (I could have made a joke there) investigating a series of mysterious deaths and ends up on the wrong side of a local dictator/warlord. Naturally Pitt saves her and is rewarded with loads of foot-soldiers out to kill him.The treasure hunt/ecology plot could have been entertaining but nothing really amazing happens. It could have worked as an Indiana Jones-lite but it's completely free of any of the iconic or classic scenes that make that franchise so famous. What we get is a lightweight James Bond kind of film with no real edge or excitement. The anonymous direction doesn't help either and the whole thing seems to drag along rather than being a breathless ride.None of this is the fault of the actors. McConaughey and Zahn are watchable as always, though I would have liked to have seen William H. Macy and Delroy Lindo given more to do. Since, I've never read any of Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt novels I cannot compare but whoever adapted the novel of Sahara into the screenplay forgot to put anything resembling spectacle or epic into it.Sahara is good for a single viewing only. There's nowt in here that make you come back for more. Which is rather worrying since Paramount bought the rights to 3 of Cussler's Dirk Pitt novels.

Avoiding fancy gadgets, avoiding the bigger the better movie, this movie combines elements of espionage, bioterror, horror, action-romance (less on the romance), and a decent straight forward storytelling with bits of humor to make this movie the most enjoyable adventure movie for far this year (January to April 2005). The threat and serious action is deadly and sincere tending away from the Romancing the Stone and Indiana Jones genre. The cinematography is excellent, the photography is impressive, the action scenes clean and furious. This movie is not overly supported by special effects or is made to secondary to the characters.

41,johnnyboyz,"Like the Sahara desert itself: big, open and spectacular to look at but dry and with not a lot going on.",5,13 April 2008,"'Dirk Pitt. Adventure has a new name' says the tagline for Sahara. I say 'Sahara. Adventure has a new level of tameness.' But that's exactly what Sahara is; a film that is too lacking in any sort of quality or content that would maybe make it interesting or adventurous. There is a distinct lack in Sahara, a distinct lack in any sort of heart or concentration to detail and character. There was a time when films like this did not exist but with the growing number of pictures such as National Treasure; Tomb Raider; The Mummy (all with sequels/spin-offs) and now this, the genre is descending into a mind dulling lull of family orientated; big on money, low on fun; mediocre passages of fast edits; yelling protagonists and a name and a face you may recognise.The names and the faces in question here are Matthew McConaughey, William H. Macy and Penelope Cruz, respectively. McConaughey plays Pitt of the tagline in search for a submarine that was used in the American Civil War but were there even iron glad submarines around back then? Although it's not this he is after but a rare coin inside the beast. Problem is, the submarine sailed off course; managed to negotiate the Atlantic and ended up in Africa, a God forsaken place so says this film. Then there is Macy back at base who fills in the comic relief role as he bickers down a phone at a critical point in two of the chief good-guy's lives as they cheat death. Macy turns up, collects his pay cheque, does what he's supposed to do and acts as a name and a face you might watch the film for before making a hasty exit  I wonder if he's actually seen this film yet, he might've. Finally you have Cruz playing Eva Rojas, a member of the World Health Organisation but most of the time her aid is rejected thanks to some warlords and she progressively gets dirtier and dirtier and sweatier and sweatier. The character starts out inquisitive and seemingly smart and helpful but she is soon relegated to pretty sidekick-come-damsel in distress  at least she isn't a cocaine addict like 99% of Hispanic characters in Hollywood films are.I think the main problem with Sahara is whether or not it wants to be smart or whether it wants to just entertain. Apart from being unexciting and anti-climatic, the film carries a certain air of monotony that you just cannot shake off. The film's idea of setting up a yet to be seen MacGuffin by the heroes and then having them go out and get it is a traditional adventure and archaeology set up but unlike Indiana Jones, there are no Nazis to battle against; there is no chief villain that carries a menacing and eerie persona and there is no rousing score as an action set piece dissolves into another one. Instead, we get British actor Lennie James playing a chief warlord dictator as he pollutes Africa's water supply under the veil of capturing solar power. For the best part; Sahara is one half dumb, comic mis-adventures of Pitt and his buddies Rudi (Wilson) and Al (Zhan) and other half sensible and intriguing voluntary work by Rojas.If Cruz' character epitomises dedication as she does her best to aid those dying in a place as deathly as Africa, then Pitt and his buddies are the binary opposite. Where Rojas is smart and kind, the Americans are dumb and lucky, getting into mis-adventures and scraps with the local pirates and patrolling war lord boats. They are tourists with a flashy boat, nice clothes and a whole load of luck. The manner in which they rid the water of two enemy boats using a cigar and leaking motor fluid has to be an insult to the many I'm sure have perished at the hands of these sorts of African dictator-led soldiers on patrol. But Rojas' character, albeher smart and likable, is used as a tool to make people aware of Africa's situation, just in case any teenager watching hasn't even heard of the place and the situation. The kick in the teeth is that after a while she joins the American glory hunters in the search for the coin and is thus relegated to pretty sidekick when Rudi is substituted for her.And so once these three are paired up for the final push toward the MacGuffin (which I'm sure Africa will see none of profit-wise when it is sold) the film descends into its series of silly action scenes and illogical stunts. Pitt knows Kung-fu but is an expert in marine studies in-between, obviously. He's also a whiz at keeping a jovial mood in times of danger and can achieve pretty impossible feats, like most characters can. The Americans bail Rojas out of trouble on several occasions, turning up just when they need to; the film peters out into an uninteresting climax in which two Americans and a Spaniard are no match for an armed to the teeth helicopter but also an army of soldiers before hand  Pitt is also a whiz at operating centuries old cannons on ships. Come the end of the film Pitt it appears had found love and rolls around with her on a far-away beach and in the sea; too bad there are so many more pirates and warlords liquidising African villages that he could be busy defeating with a cigar and some motor fluid. How ignorant, or perhaps it's a political statement: nobody does anything even though they easily have the firepower to do so. Hang on; Sahara? A political film? Yeah, right.",Sahara
42,leplatypus,An enjoyable SANDventure (DVD),4,25 February 2006,"Sahara may be a ""sleeper"", a unknown movie for a lot of people while it should be a recommendation.If the story is conventional (adventures in Africa with a bunch of antagonist characters: two modern ""Indiana Jones"" & a naive doctoress), the cast is first loaded with international stars.Then, the vision of Africa is respectful: true locations, subtle background about politics, health. It reminds of the excellent ""Beyond Borders"" or ""Tomb Raider"", which depict the same artistic feeling of an ancestral continent, deeply rooted in folklore and closeness to the nature.And last but not least, the DVD offers great bonuses: for the fun, you can hear actually Miss Cruz ""burp"" in an interview. More seriously, the comments of the director and McConaughey add a great value to the package: you really understand their dedication in this movie and they share some useful backstage comments (see the drink on the boat).Not bad for a little movie.... Some other blockbusters should learn....",Sahara
43,elshikh4,The Very Fast Adventure !,6,5 October 2009,"It's a Hollywood movie, and that doesn't mean necessarily a bad thing; Well, many times it does, but at least not every time!It's an adventure that wants to be just different. It did that by non-stop action, many explosions, some surprises, and smart mix of (Indiana Jones) and (James Bond). So it was amusing, but to tell you the truth, not that amusing!This movie got no time for anything, being so hyper in such a bad way. There are many characters and events, but without a rational pace to comprehend all of that, or make you integrate with any fun the movie presents. It was at times more like a hard rock song where the paces are louder than the lyrics.When it comes to the script, the problem is not in the stereotypes that make you feel ""I've seen all of that before"", it's rather that the new matters were few, and the new - well made - matters, like escaping from the burning mirrors, were fewer!(Penélope Cruz) was so out of the mood, not having one atom of chemistry with (Matthew McConaughey). And again there was no time to feel her character well; namely making a love / hate relationship with the lead, or anything that justifies falling in love him which the end suggests. So how did that happen while he didn't have a time, during the whole movie, to even look at her for God's sake?!(Matthew McConaughey) seemed, like the main story, unfortunate among all of this. The movie gave no clever one-liner to (Steve Zahn), so (William H. Macy) as well. The plot of killing the bad guys at the end, by (Delroy Lindo)'s character, wasn't given much time. As you see, this movie was part fine and imaginative, part hasty and weak. I know that the first part won, however by slight score!(Sahara) was about to be an idiot images flapping consecutively on screen. But it didn't. It ended up as a computer game runs hotly, while your feeling towards it is largely cold. In fact, what it achieves is just a mediocre entertainment, while your faith that this material, with another writing, casting, editing, and directing, could have been something more entertaining.It's a very fast adventure, blockbuster and experience.

In fact I'll put him in the same league as Elmore Leonard and Louis L'Amour and I will put them in the same league as Dumas and Doyle.They all write pulp fiction, adventure, crime, mystery, horror, whatever, they all fall under the title ""pulp"" and I can admit that I eat them whole, without swallowing......and without the need to call them ""Literary"" in an effort to save face.I have the academic degrees somewhere in a box, the intellectual prowess, and a library with enough classics and heady works of history and philosophy to be able to openly display writers like Chris Claremont, Marv Wolfman, and Timothy Zane to not have to call his work ""Literature."" I will however call it ""Adventure"" I will call it ""Fun"" and what should be most important to any writer or film maker...""Entertaining."" It doesn't have to follow the book. Jackie Brown was a far cry from Rum punch and they were both a lot of fun to watch and read.So Sahara isn't like the novel.It is an Action-Adventure-Comedy. That means it is everything that pulp should be, it is everything that movies should be...In fact it is the kind of film that the critics would have loved in the Golden Age of Hollywood.",Sahara

46,dfranzen70,An oasis in a desert of Indiana Jones ripoffs,8,17 October 2005,"I swear, when I first heard that Sahara, a movie based on the Dirk Pitt books by Clive Cussler, was finally coming out, I didn't have very high expectations. I've read several of the books, and they always seem almost made for action movies, complete with larger-than-life (but one-dimensional) characters and wild, exotic locales. So I skipped watching this in the theater, and I now strongly regret that decision.The basic plot is that Dirk Pitt, Director of Special Projects for the National Underwater and Marine Agency, thinks an old Civil War-era ironclad ship has somehow found its way to a river in Africa. At the same time, a luscious doctor with the World Health Organization discovers there's been a viral outbreak in the same general area in Africa. Might these two meet up at some point during the movie? Pitt (Matthew McConaughey) is part Superman, part daredevil, part Lothario, part Jacques Cousteau, and part Albert Einstein. Naturally, such a person would never exist in real life, but the character is so likable - a devilish rogue, if you will - on paper that one forgives the transparency of his personality. He's adept at solving mysteries large and small, but he can't be without his trusty sidekick Al Giordino (Steve Zahn). Dirk and Al head to Mali, off the southwestern coast of Africa, because they think the old ironclad Texas somehow landed there; Dirk's evidence is a single gold coin supposedly commissioned by Jefferson Davis. The two are joined by Dr. Eva Rojas (Penelope Cruz), the WHO doctor who is trying to trace the source of a deadly virus.I won't bore you with the plot, but it's important to note that unlike the recent James Bond movies, the settings do not exist as simple travelogues (as in, ""Wow, look! We're in Finland! Now we're in Australia! Now we're in Swaziland!"" and so forth); instead, everything does make perfect logical sense. Also, the storyline isn't so complicated as to be confusing; sometimes action movies overplot themselves to distract the viewer from its incoherence. The photography is fantastic, and even simple acts like Stuff Blowing Up look wonderful.It's not easy to read the books and picture Al Giordino as a pale, skinny guy instead of a stocky Italian, but Zahn was quite believable in the role. One might have figured that talent would take a back seat to whimsical casting on the order of stereotypical, stock characterizations. Uh-uh, one would be wrong. Zahn is so perfectly cast, he actually manages to walk off with scenes, no mean feat considering the special effects and the natural charisma of McConaughey. In the books, Al is just the kind of pal you want to be with in a tight situation, but he can also toss off the random bon mot. Zahn was able to do that and much more, a pleasant surprise.Perhaps most importantly, McConaughey and Zahn had perfect chemistry together, and I could be convinced that they truly were lifelong buddies. Even better, both played off Cruz pretty well, too. I had a little trouble buying her as a smart doctor, but I can suspend my disbelief a little. It's not as if she were Denise Richards in that James Bond movie I can't remember because it wasn't very good.Often, action movies have logical holes you could drive a Hummer through, moments in which you actually stop and think, ""Wait, that can't happen... you cannot use snakes to pick a lock,"" or something similar. If a movie makes you stop and think, and it's not a thinking-man's movie, then it's failed somehow. Bombs are good, but let's make 'em plausible bombs! At any rate, Sahara never does this. Everything ties in, but not obviously so. Sure, you know Eva and Dirk will meet cute and wind up together, but anyone reading any of the Dirk Pitt books knows this. He always gets the girl. And then the next book, he gets another. He's so cool.So, to sum up: Sahara is in the grand tradition of adventure movies like Raiders of the Last Ark, but unlike most pretenders to the Indiana Jones throne it's frantically entertaining.",Sahara
47,XweAponX,"""I don't know whose book they are adapting, but it ain't mine!""",7,2 January 2007,"Other than the cast being partially acceptable, Clive is probably disappointed in this- Whatever it is. It is a story, which appears to resemble the book Sahara by Clive Cussler. Other than the names of the characters there is practically no resemblance to the great Dirk Pitt© adventure book Sahara which I read back in 1994.The book had plots and subplots and intertwined and were delicately threaded to a hammering conclusion by Cussler.Almost all of the subplots were taken out. The events of the book are either missing or radically changed.As I stated in another review elsewhere: Hollywood will rewrite every book property they can get their grubby little hands on, be it Sahara or The Bible Itself.However, despite my disappointment, I want to see Matthew McWhatsHisFace try again. And lose the southern accent! Pitt© was born in California! And he was in the Air Force Academy: NOT The Navy Seals.If Cussler was pi**ed off about all this cra* being changed, I'm pi**ed off with Cussler about it.Cussler is one writer you CAN NOT change. Which is why this the second Dirk Pitt© adventure is relatively disappointing.Other than that: I give the film itself a higher grade, there are some cinematic moments here.Matt: Next time STICK TO THE STORY!",Sahara

Unfortunately the A1 sauce here doesn't arrive at the table until almost 40 minutes into the meal, and by then you've filled up on the day old dinner rolls.It doesn't help that the threat is undercooked to the point of being raw, and the generic villain is so stale you'll chip a tooth. A few more decent action scenes await, but by then you'll just be looking for your server so you can pay the check and go grab a pizza down the street.",Sahara
49,aharmas,what was Hollywood thinking?,4,10 April 2005,"Hollywood must have known the first people out to see this film were the people who have read the books. So, did the casting people bother to even look past the covers? Who in the world is going to believe Penelope Cruz can play a doctor? and did I miss what the sidekick was supposed to look like in the 6 or 7 books I have read??? Nothing against Steve Zhan, who does quite a decent job playing another type of character. Then, there is no chemistry between the leads (male and female). The effects are decent, and some of the vistas reminded me how ""Lawrence of Arabia"" achieved its greatness, but overall, this film doesn't signal good things for the franchise. Maybe next time, the studio should bother hiring people who actually know how to read to write a decent screenplay, casting people who can do their job, and actors who can emote beyond one set of emotions. ""Raiders"" was good because there was a lot of care and hard work in it. ""Sahara"" is a not quite there...",Sahara
50,adamjohns-42575,Bond meets Indiana Jones.,5,10 August 2020,"Matthew McConaughey should always make films like this. It's definitely what he's best at for my money. I also really liked Steve Zahn in this one and thought that Penelope did a great job in her role too.
This is a good film for fans of 007 or Indy or Tomb Raider among others. It's full of explosions, chases, life threatening stunts and action all over the place.
I like the story and would definitely be tempted to read more by Clive Cussler, but it is lacking something, what, I cannot say, but I enjoyed it. Perhaps it's a bit too easy and simple, which is usually my go to, but I do tend to like my films of this genre to have a few twists and tricks in them.
Also, awesome soundtrack!",Sahara
51,rbverhoef,Wall to wall action; I almost couldn't care less,4,16 October 2005,"'Sahara' contains everything an action film could contain these days but it does that in such a predictable or sometimes even stupid way I could not care less. Almost. The sidekick of the hero, who is called Al Giordino (Steve Zahn), is the one thing I really liked here. Much of this is because of Zahn, not because the screenplay gives him a lot of opportunities. The hero by the way has a name unlike any other hero: Dirk Pitt (Matthew McConaughey). It is hard to see a hero named Dirk, although it is probably better than a last name that sounds like McConaughey. On the other hand, that sounds a bit more adventurous. I think I am talking about the wrong things here, but it is the kind of movie that even raises questions in that area.The love interest, of course we need a thing like that for a hero, is played by Penélope Cruz and has a pretty normal name, Eva Rojas. The story is set in Western Africa and deals with a French villain as well as an entire government, or actually an African dictator and his army. Dirk Pitt is searching for a certain ship and he thinks it must be somewhere in the desert. How and why would be silly to explain. The villains only become villains since he helps Eva Rojas, a doctor investigating a plague spread by the French villain and his dictator friend. The plague would destroy so many things, the entire Ocean life to be exactly, one wonders what advantage they could possibly find in doing the things they do.On their way Dirk, Al and Eva encounter real danger and the action scenes enter our screens. I can enjoy absurd action scenes, James Bond movies are created out of them, but other things need to be pretty good to make the scenes entertaining. Here we have only silly things to enjoy (like a scene where they destroy their own boat to trick the enemy) and Steve Zahn's comedy can not save that. We also have the boss of Dirk and Al, the owner of the boat, who is played by William H. Macy. Normally he is an actor who at least makes his own scenes entertaining but in 'Sahara' he has nothing to entertain us with.I think there must be an audience for 'Sahara', but even the people who do like it will frown their eyebrows from time to time and think of the better movies they have seen in the genre. I think a lot of titles will enter their minds.",Sahara

I had a good time watching it though it does drag a bit in places, and yes, you HAVE seen it all before. Having never read a word of Cussler, I can't approach this as a fan, instead as someone who figured it was another 'National Treasure/Mummy' type flick.....Yup. It's that alright. Generally on That level, it works.Matthew M is fine as the lead, someone mentioned he was too frat-boyish for the role, and yah I can see the point. But whatever, he sold it for me. Steven Zahn essentially plays Barney Rubble, by way of Sean Astin's 'Sam Gamgee' schtick, and a little of him went a long ways. Somehow I expected him to be, well, a more with-it character. Guess not.Ms Cruz usually leaves me flat but here she did a fine job. Delroy Lindo has essentially a walk-on, and the guy from 'Six Feet Under' channels Rick Moranis entertainingly enough. Bill Macy was Bill Macy--you know him when ya see him.Some of the plotting-Merrimack-type ironclad from 1865 winds up in Mali(!?), the cannon still works, bad French guy producing chemicals and etc nearby-was a little tossed together. I can't say that the whole 'Helicopter strafes w/ mini guns and misses but the 150 year old cannon hits' bit exactly rang true, but it Was funny. You don't for a second believe it. Rambo and Missing in Action time, ya know? And the whole 'killer algea/toxic waste that will over-run the 7 Seas' thing was right outta the Man from Uncle or bad Bond.

56,Victor Field,Maybe it won't be 25 years before there's another Dirk Pitt movie.,6,23 April 2005,"If ""Sahara"" (""A Clive Cussler Dirk Pitt Adventure"") had had the kind of reception ""Raise The Titanic"" received way back in 1980, it would have cemented Clive Cussler's initial decision to not let any of his works be filmed (his attempts to bring legal action notwithstanding), although it likely wouldn't have sunk the nine - count 'em, NINE - production companies credited. As it is, the movie is a vast improvement on the boring and stupid ""National Treasure,"" although it's still no threat to Indiana Jones.The secret is that, despite not much in the way of nail-biting action and strong characterisation, the story always has something happening. True, the plot - salvage expert Matthew McConaughey and sidekick Steve Zahn are on the trail of a Civil War ship that may or may not have wound up in Africa, and get entwined with WHO doctor Penelope Cruz's investigation of a plague - isn't high on plausibility or intelligent dialogue, and the movie abandons any attempts at credibility around the time our heroes go windsurfing across the desert in a wrecked plane with ""Magic Carpet Ride"" playing on the soundtrack (you heard me). Incidentally, Clint Mansell's score is a lot more effective than the classic rock songs slathered on (why is Grand Funk Railroad's ""We're An American Band"" playing when McConaughey and his shipmates raise a tomb from the sea?).But on the upside, Zahn ensures there'll be humour; McConaughey and Cruz are less useless than Nicolas Cage and Diane Kruger (special thanks to the fates for the chance to see a) her cleavage in the climax and b) her in a swimsuit - look, you notice these things if you're a guy, all right?); the action, when it comes, works; and while it does get silly, at least it's the good kind of silly. It does waste William H. Macy, true, but Lambert Wilson does avoid sliming up the screen with overacting this time around; and all told, it's a decent time-passer, if seeming a bit too obviously designed to launch a franchise... and the ending isn't nearly as frustrating as that of ""Raise The Titanic."" One thing though - why does the villain's company logo look like the Motown one?",Sahara
57,vip_ebriega,Silly adventure movie fun... with a heart,6,14 April 2008,"My Take: James Bond meets Indiana Jones with silly yet exciting action, crackling wit. Although it was credited as a ""Dirk Pitt Adventure"", SAHARA seems more in kin with James Bond and Indiana Jones than Clive Cussler. I haven't read any of Clive Cussler's books, but I'm absolutely certain that this would be Cussler's visualization. It is, indeed, a B-level adventure film, complete with heroes in top gear (complete with winning grin, no less), the sexy heroine, the sidekick, and the bad guys who want to rule the world (or simply get whatever it is they want). Not to mention the series of stunt play and gunfights done the old-fashioned way. This is the look (and feel) of an action picture they no longer make, which provides most of its appeal. I enjoyed SAHARA on the level many think it doesn't work, and that's being a traditional old-fashioned brainless adventure. It's not great at the field, but at least it has its heart on it.Its tag line states ""Adventure has a new name"", it's without question or doubt that Dirk Pitt, Cussler's brainchild hero played here by Matthew McConaughey, will be a new James Bond or Indiana Jones. The charisma given to him is good but obvious. He's calm over tension, and never loses his cool even at extreme measures. The other supporting characters have nothing in them, their there, but practically, their hardly anybody but characters in a movie. If characters in adventure movies could be quite as interesting as those featured in the INDIANA JONES series, couldn't we deserve to get the same on other entries in the genre, including knock-offs.Still, what you've come to expect from SAHARA are here anyway. The implausible plot involves the quest for a lost Ironclad in the middle of the Sahara desert (!) by the dashing Dirk Pitt (McConaughey), his sidekick Al (Steve Zahn) and a daring Dr. Eva Rojas (Penelope Cruz), who trek through the blazing desert landscape with camels, vans, boats, you name it. Along the way, they are trailed by the bad guys and get into situations that could only mean more action movie fun. What's in store? Helicopter chases (my favorite!), gunfights, boat chases and even a train chase with camels (who even knew that you can still come up with a fun action movie sequence with camels!). If you don't think this stuff is any fun, you may wanna have to check with your doctor in case your sugar's a little low.Is SAHARA any great? No it isn't. But did I get exactly what I wanted from it? It surely does. Even if this genre, which includes films like NATIONAL TREASURE, will never live up to its superior INDIANA JONES ancestors, they will still nonetheless offer the action and adventure it promises. And in that level, SAHARA delivers.Rating: *** out of 5.",Sahara
58,SanteeFats,Very entertaining,8,12 April 2014,"I found this to be an enjoyable movie. Matthew McConaughey is great in a tongue in cheek scam artist character. Although the ending is rather hard to believe. I mean you have a Confederate ironclad that has traveled all the way across the Atlantic loaded with gold and it makes it all the way up a river in Africa to end up stranded in the desert? How did it load enough fuel to start with? There is the crooked business man who is polluting the water sources, the dictator that doesn't care about anything as long as he gets his money every month, and the Tuareg who are paying the price of the pollution. It all comes to a head when they actually do find the ironclad and the dictator shows up in an attack chopper. This is where it gets rather strange to say the least. The ironclad armor is supposedly two feet thick yet the copters armor piercing shells punch through it like cheese. Then the good guys use a Civil War cannon to shoot down the chopper. Now the ammo, powder, and other munitions have lain there for 150 years yet it fires right off the bat? Like I said I did enjoy this movie but.",Sahara

From the U.S Civil War to James Bond style shoot-outs on a sci-fi set? You bet.In between there is Penelope Cruz, being totally unconvincing as a world health officer and Matthew McConnuahey as a mixture of bad Indiana Jones and 007. More of the former, actually. Steve Zahn pops up as some sidekick or another but does so humorously and energetically, which is all that matters.

While there is no proof for such an argument either way, Breck has proved to be not much worse than other directors. In fact he did better than most and worse than some. Sahara is best described as a typical entertaining adventure in the vein of Indiana Jones or perhaps National Treasure. It has a tough good guy (McConaughey), a funny sidekick (Zane) and admirable eye-candy (Cruz). Now I admit that most things are quite shallow, but if you mix all of the above mentioned ingredients with a decent story, good action sequences and throw in the fact that there isn't one nanosecond of corniness in this movie, you inevitably end up with a crowd pleasing blockbuster.7,25 out of 10",Sahara

So, when I heard about this movie, I've waited for a few months to rent this on a DVD copy from a library in order to watch it to keep me enthralled. What a surprise, it did. It's not one of the greatest movies ever made, but I've seen much worse films. While it does have an Indiana Jones vibe to it, Sahara is a lot more different. Sure, it's pacing is a bit slow and the dialog is beyond disbelief, but I agree with the others on this website that this is a solid adventure movie and an underrated one at that.Before I begin this review, I read some books made by Clive Cussler and to my surprise, they're excellent. His source material is solid with engaging story lines and efficient writing. The story in this movie has some alterations as I have heard from most people, but when it comes to judging a film adaptation by it's own merits, it's mostly exciting and the script is witty with some hilarious moments. The characters are great, too. Matthew McConaughey did great as the lead role and had just the right charisma for the part while Penelope Cruz is beautiful and unbelievably sexy. Steve Zahn is hilarious as the comedic sidekick and William H. Macy did great as Lennie James. Delroy Lindo, although underused, is also great.The action is amazing and tense with the finale as the best, the music from Clint Mansell fits well with both the tone and the genre, and the direction from Breck Einser is solid with a lot more focus to it. What stands out the most, however, is it's cinematography, it's beautiful landscapes, and wonderful settings that gives the movie an epic sweep to it.Overall, Sahara isn't the best movie I've seen, but it's a pretty good Indiana Jones and James Bond clone despite the mixed reception it had and became one of the biggest bombs in cinema history. Go watch it! It is that good!",Sahara
65,artzau,"Fun, Fun, Fun",7,9 April 2005,"So, what do the critic expect? Look guys, read the book. We're talking Clive Cussler here. Nice thing about his novels is they hark back to the pulp novels of the 40s where the heroes are heroic, the villains villainous and the female interests beautiful, all splashed across an exotic canvas. So,is a Clive Cussler novel predictable? Formulaic? Slightly less than top grade thriller material? Hey. Go read the guy and judge for yourself.But, this adaptation of his novel is delightful. Penelope Cruz is gorgeous but not cutsie-tootsie. McConaughey and Zahn have this slapstick buddy role going and Macy is a great Admiral Sandecker. An improbable story? Weird events? Not Indiana Jones? Huh.What did you expect. Hey, take it from the old movie buff, this one is fun, fun, fun. And then, there's Penelope Cruz...",Sahara
66,Mr_Sensitive,Not Really Satisfying Adventure Movie.,5,21 October 2006,"For an adventure movie, this movie isn't much of an adventure for me. It was quite a let down and though it got all the stars it didn't even safe the film from sinking. Staring Matthew and Steve as the treasure hunters in search of a lost battle ship and along the way tried to help the WHO worker find the source of the plague.There not thing really wrong with the movie only that it didn't quite bring what it supposes to bring - action adventure. The movie is quite slow for this genre of movie plus after the movie I feel I didn't watch anything much happen in the movie. The script was all right but didn't pack enough action into the flick and when there is an action occur they gone overboard with it. Also most of the characters are pretty shallow and undeveloped despite having 124 min in hand. Plus everything about this movie is predictable.The highlight part of the movie got to be the casting of Steve Zahn although he isn't much of a funny guy here, even though they tried to make his character to. He still nice and bring a little joy into this movie.Overall, it was an unsatisfying adventure movie. The movie seems to be lacking in everything.Reason To Watch: The Cast Reason Not To: Not Enough Action.Rating: 5.5/10 (Grade: D )",Sahara
67,Antagonisten,A fun ride while it lasts,6,29 December 2005,"I remember reading loads of Clive Cussler-books when i was about 14-15 or so. My Cussler-period lasted until i was maybe 17 and ""Sahara"" was one of the books i read. I opened one of the old Cussler-books just a few months ago to see if i could still appreciate it, but i found the book to be horrible. Poorly written, unexciting and dull. I guess i grew away from it. But i still have my memories from when i first read his books and i remember ""Sahara"" being one of the more outrageous and entertaining.Dirk Pitt is played by Matthew McConaughey who is of course completely wrong for the role judged by the book, as is Steve Zahn as Gilardino. First of all McConaughey should be older and Zahn should be a stocky Italian guy. But that aside they both fit nicely into the picture. The story has been quite substantially altered compared to the book which was probably a good move. The book is completely bereft of any aspirations at realism. The movie is better while still retaining the playful imagination that is Cusslers trademark.So is this a funny adventure-movie? Or a good action-flick? Well, it's not that bad at least. The action-scenes are well made enough and the adventure-feeling is reasonably present. The thing that disturbed me most was that the story felt rushed in many places. The characters would start doing something and then the next second they would be transported several hours forward in time doing something completely different. I don't know if it's bad editing, lack of money or just an attempt to tighten up the script. All i know is it feels strange at times.For the adventure-movie buff there is really not that much to choose from in todays movies. The glorious days of Indiana Jones have passed and left a blank space in it's wake. A space that different movies have since tried to fill, for instance movies like ""National Treasure"". They haven't done a very good job in my opinion and ""Sahara"" comes closer than most. While this is a movie that is instantly forgettable, it's a pretty fun ride while it lasts. Which is really all you can demand of a movie like this one. I rate it 6/10.",Sahara

What's the point of casting a hot lady like her and then really playing down her sexuality. Matt M isn't really action enough to be a navy seal, and neither is his mate. His friend is such a bad shot, he's supposed to be a SEAL? Navy seals everywhere should be boycotting this movie. The bad marksmanship, the inability to leopard crawl and kitten crawl. neither of the 2 so-called seals knew how to keep their asses down. why were they even bothering to try and fire cannons that hadn't been used in over 100 years. The cannons were more likely to have exploded than to have actually fired. The inability of the guy in the back of the jeep to hit a helicopter (doesn't everyone know that even the Vietcong could shoot down helicopters with one shot but this elite navy seal can't even hit such a big target), also that he didn't know how count rounds in a magazine. every serviceman is taught to avoid the so-called ""dead mans click"". the end of this was rubbish. i figure it'd lead to a sequel though, the end just feels like it will.",Sahara
69,the-movie-guy,Sahara is enjoyable and the chase scenes are very good,7,8 April 2005,"Underwater treasure hunter Dirk Pitt (Matthew McConaughey) has been searching for the remains of a fabled Civil War ironclad battleship that left the United States at the end of the war in 1865 and sailed to west Africa. Nobody believes that the ironclad battleship ever existed, but Dirk finds proof, because local legend has a name for it, ""The Ship of Death"". Dirk and his lifelong buddy, Al Giordino (Steve Zahn), set out to find the ship. Doctor Eva Rojas (Penelope Cruz) with the World Health Organization catches a ride on Dirk's boat to find the source of a plague that is following a path along the Niger River. They soon become the target of an African warlord who wants to stop them from finding out what is really happening in his country.Sahara follows the same movie format similar to that of National Treasure. The movie was a little too long and some of the slow scenes could be cut. The boat chase action scenes are very good, along with several others. During the whole movie, they asked the question how could an ironclad battleship sail all the way to Africa? You don't get an answer. Just sit back and enjoy the movie, and don't worry about the facts. (Paramount, Run time 2:07, Rated PG-13) (7/10)",Sahara
70,MichaelMargetis,National Treasure 2?,4,8 April 2005,"It's not a good thing when you say Steve Zahn is the talent of a movie. Well, in this film, Steve Zahn outshines both Mathew McConaughey and Penolope Cruz. 'Sahara' is an often entertaining shoot-em-up adventure popcorn flick with almost no originality. The film follows the same tired old formula; two guys -- one strong and handsome (McConaughey), the other shrimpy and goofy (Zahn), and one strong independent female (Cruz) who is interested in the strong male, and then there is action sequences and she gets captured and it's up to the strong male to save her. That's pretty much what 'Sahara' ends up being.I was skeptical going into the theater because I thought it was going to be a rip-off of National Treasure, and it really wasn't (I'll give the 'Sahara' credit for that). It's not so much about finding treasure, as much as it is battling terrorists and stop them from spreading a plague involving nuclear chemicals. Personally, I found 'National Treasure' to be more exhilarating and fun to watch, but 'Sahara' has some good points. There are non-original but still fun-to-watch action scenes and some funny one-liners mostly from Steve Zahn and Six Feet Under's Rainn Wilson (who has a kind of small role). Everybody has small roles in 'Sahara' except the three leads (McConaughey, Zahn, Cruz) which may be a bad thing. In the small-role supporting cast are great actors such as William H. Macy and Delroy Lindo whose talents go to waste in this lackluster film. The bad guys in 'Sahara' are played by Lennie James (Snatch., 24 Hour Party People) who plays a greedy general/warlord of Africa, and Lambert Wilson (The Matrix Reloaded, The Matrix Revolutions) who plays an equally as greedy French businessman who helps the general to make a profit. These actors aren't too bad, but McConaughey and Cruz totally suck. There are scenes they share that will make you wonder if they are having a contest on who can act the worst. They both really crap on the film as much as they can.In conclusion, 'Sahara' is just an average action flick. Nothing special and nothing horrible. It's just kind of insignificant. I don't recommend seeing it in theaters but waiting for DVD or HBO. I think people who enjoyed the book will be a little disappointed (or so I heard). Grade: C. (screened at AMC Deer Valley 30, Phoenix Arizona, 4/08/05)",Sahara
71,ruby_fff,"It's good clean fun - brisk adventure popcorn movie, positively so",7,17 April 2005,"Sometimes it's good to go into a movie with no 'brainer' attitude - zero expectation actually enables me to relax and take the film as it is. That's the case with director Breck Eisner's ""Sahara,"" which starred Matthew McConaughey (who is one of the executive producers of the film) and Penélope Cruz, with the ever enthusiastic presence of Steve Zahn, and the cool reassuring appearance of William H. Macy. Even if the plot borders on implausibility, it's nice to feel that 'tis utterly possible in its comic book setting. Why not? I'd like to think it's a 'subtle' hint at best - those hazardous 'dumps' by irresponsible greedy villains threatening the world's natural habitat, and we do need a heroic trio to save the day.So it's a popcorn adventure flick. Enjoyable good clean fun with clear delineation of the good and the bad. Yes, there's James Bond like action sequences - might as well. The 'do a Panama' segment reminded me of the boat chase scene in director Terence Young's ""From Russia With Love"" (1963). ""Sahara"" doesn't take its plot seriously - no thick immersion in any specific genre like ""Sin City."" No over the top violent actions - just breezy adventure not hung up on lofty visions. There's actually beautiful desert 'sandscapes' and even the use of a silhouette scene: two on camels trotting across the horizon against a setting sun. Cliché or not, it's matinée Hollywood entertainment successfully delivered.The movie has its details, but they're not thrust at you (while ""Sin City"" certainly 'captures/traps' an audience's focused attention, demandingly so). It's easy-going, straightforward amusement. If you buy into the environmental endangerment theme, sure, take it. If not, it won't lessen the enjoyment of this matinée.In 2004, we had ""National Treasures"" (d: Jon Turteltaub; Nicolas Cage in the lead) and ""Hidalgo"" (d: Joe Johnston; Viggo Mortensen leads).

75,bsinc,"A decent attempt for an adventure movie, lacks more heart and a good director",6,9 November 2005,"A couple of days ago I saw ""National Treasure"" with Nicholas Cage. If that movie has serious issues with an innovative approach to the story (and it DOES!) then ""Sahara"" is a breath of somewhat fresher Hollywood air-conditioned air. Gone are the so familiar Indiana Jones-ish sets and story, this movie is a whole different ball game. Which still doesn't mean it's much better, but it at least looks and feels much less recycled, which is almost deserving of an applause.Beautifully shot ""Sahara"" feels neatly polished and with one of the best opening scenes in a long time it starts off fairly decent(that one long shot around the room with so much attention to details it probably took a very long time to get all that stuff into place, let alone film it, and not to forget the cool song as well).It gets complicated when after an hour or so the principal story of the so-called ""Ship of death"" is NOWHERE to be found, all that initial ""fanfare"" for nothing-just some apparent high hopes. Instead, a second plot is pursued-with less success, so suddenly ""Sahara"" turns out to be just another very average action movie where the good guys outsmart the dumb bad foot-soldiers. And the whole time this was going on I was wondering what it has to do with the ""Ship"" and if the movie is even getting to that. Somehow it never does, it just becomes very silly at points. The fact that such explanations as to just how exactly does Mrs. Cruz get out of a deep and wide water well without a rope or how to get a tool-kit out of a plane when your wrist is attached to half of a car's trunk (ergo one might say you have quite the obstruction), or even how that old crashed plane is quickly turned into a desert surfboard on wheels that runs like a charm(...no, I don't know either). That's all in the good old fashioned spirit of not stopping the story and keeping the pace (damn-forgot the expression), but the thin red line was crossed with their first attempt at this. From this point on there is little hope for any salvation, the ending is more than clear from the start, so all that's left is the missing key-where can the main protagonists stumble upon the ""Ship of death"", with only about 10-15 minutes to go. Well, they blow it out of the sand with some dynamite they accidentally throw exactly upon this very spot in the whole friggin desert...need I repeat (I do!) that the ""thin"" in the ""red line"" has again crossed it-frankly, I was sure that such idiotic examples of story-wrapping were reserved for Mr. Ed Wood exclusively, he was at least good at making them bad. 6/10Recommendations-the same league as ""National Treasure"".

It's all put together with tongue firmly in cheek, and although the jokes and funny moments won't raise more than a giggle, it's good that they've steered away from the total comedy route.Matthew McConaughey is surprisingly good in the role, relaxed and natural. If the series picks up then he'll have no problem returning to the role, if he wants it.

Along with his wisecracking sidekick (Steve Zahn) and a U.N. scientist (Penelope Cruz), they navigate the vast Sahara desert for the source of this environmental disaster.I have never read the book but the film did sound like it could be enjoyable. However, it was not a fun film to watch at all. I kept waiting for something fun or exciting to happen but nothing ever did. The beginning was slow and boring, the middle had a few action scenes, nothing special though and the ending was disappointing and stupid. The only reason people watch these films is for action and eye-candy. Sahara gave me neither and it was really one long, tedious mess.The acting was average at best since all the three leads seemed more interested in a paycheck than anything else. Matthew McConaughey did an okay job and at least he has 2 For the Money coming out soon. Steve Zahn wasn't as funny as I thought he was going to be. He did an okay job as well. Penelope Cruz isn't a very good actress. I have never been impressed by any of her performances and this one wasn't any better. It was also kind of hard to buy her as a scientist. Breck Eisner did a bad job of directing as he just has a poor style of filming action scenes.I like films that are highly unbelievable as those types of movies are fun to watch. The Transporter 2 and National Treasure were both fun films. Sahara was just a not a fun movie to watch. The one liners that were supposed to be funny weren't. The action was below average and the film could have been cut short as the ending dragged longer than needed. The running time of two hours felt so much longer and I almost fell asleep a couple of times as well. I didn't really have high expectations for the film but I was expecting something better. In the end, Sahara is only worth watching if you're a hardcore fan of any of the three leads. If you're not then stay away from this movie. Rating 3/10.",Sahara
80,daisukereds,It lacks something..,6,6 November 2020,"A cross between a fan-made Indiana Jones and a James Bond movie of late. It's nowhere close to being a great movie, but it's not terrible. While entertaining, well done, and not particularly boring.. it is hardly memorable. It lacks too many good pieces to be a classic, or something you'd recommend to anyone.It has your main hero, capable in most situations and with knowledge short of a genius. Thankfully, his ""greatness"" as a hero is shared with someone else. Also capable and not entirely annoying.
The rest of the cast is good and the group works great as adventurers.. but would fit a TV series much better. Considering that with a movie budget, they were incapable of turning heads in their direction.. they would probably fall short there as well.I quite like it myself for what it is, but it's a one and done.

But more importantly than that is the fact that too much of what made the plot of the book so good is missing from the screenplay. When I first heard that a movie was being made from this book I was excited, but it just seemed to fall flat. But having said that it was still exciting enough to make it worth one watching anyway.

83,CelluloidRehab,Indiana Jones Labotomy,4,16 September 2005,"The movie starts out with a ""historical"" flashback to the end of the Civil War, where an iron Confederate ship is loading gold and setting sail for ports unknown. The intro then proceeds into a montage of scrap booking regarding the whereabouts of the ship and Dirk Pitt's (Matthew McConaughey's porn named ex-Navy seal turned treasure hunter character) obvious attempts to find the ""mysterious"" ship.This is a pretty descent start with a lot of possibilities and is quite intriguing. Somehow on top of this story is the story of a disease coming from Mali (in western Africa) which works fast and kills instantly. It is being investigated by two WHO (World Health Organization) doctors and is secretly being hushed up. Is there a connection between the African bound Confederate iron ship and the disease ?? You'll just have to watch and see for yourself.So somehow Dirk meets up with one of the doctors, Eva Rojas (Penélope Cruz) and the two story arcs become poorly intertwined. There are times when each story takes precedence, but for the most part, the disease takes the front seat of the narrative with the ship becoming the occasional annoying backseat driver.This movie has promise, especially around the first boat fight sequence. After that, it is a landslide downhill. McConaughey does a pretty good job, playing it much better than Nicolas Cage's leathery performance in National Treasure. Unfortunately, is it me or does McConaughey ""act"" more and more like himself (namely an ego driven, obnoxious blow hole) in each new movie? Steve Zahn is the perennial sidekick and comedy relief. He also plays his role pretty well. Now to the third member of this triumvirate, Penélope Cruz. My GOD !!! Was she hocked up on Valium or what ? I mean she looks pretty good, but I think the director could have substituted her with an inflatable doll and there would have been a slight improvement. Also, where does the romantic relationship between Dirk and Eva come from ?? I've seen more romantic attachment from a plant.This movie seems to have attention deficit disorder. It doesn't seem to want to stick with the ship story nor the disease story exclusively, and it screws up both. I understand suspension of disbelief and not taking itself seriously, but come on. I'm not expecting Citizen Kane here, but a little focus would have been better. There are just some scenes that are simple ridiculous : the solar power plant, the wind sailing plane on alternating 1 and 2 wheels respectively and the fight scene at the end (reminiscent of the end scene of Rambo 3, except replace tank with 100+ year old Civil War cannon).As with other movies, like the Transporter, this movie starts out with some panache and a spark of possibility, but by half-way through the movie, it seems to run out of ideas and dies a slow death (beach-ball-with-a-hole-in-it analogy). If one wants a good action movie with a treasure hunting theme (and as an alternative to Indiana Jones) one can go no further than Jackie Chan's Armor of God 1 and 2. If you want a grade A, B-movie of the same genre, try Richard Chamberlain in two Allan Quatermain movies from the 80's (with a young Sharon Stone). If you want to get real adventurous, try Chuck Norris' Firewalker. These are all better than Sahara.Sahara is not recommended for individual consumption. Watch this as a group and pass the tequila.",Sahara
84,Mr Parker,"Clive Cussler, I feel your pain",4,15 April 2005,"Wow, this may be one of the blandest movies I have ever seen. Raiders of the Lost Ark this ain't.It's a shame because I like all the principal actors in this one. I like Matthew ""Bongos at 3am"" McConaughey, I like Penelope ""Not Naked in This Particular Film"" Cruz and Steve ""Great Facial Expressions"" Zahn. Even the supporting parts played by William ""does movies like this and Jurassic Park III when not actually acting, strictly for the rent"" H. Macy and Lambert ""wipes his arse with silk"" Wilson were okay. I just felt like the movie had nothing exciting about it, even with all the explosions and gunfire. Some of the action was okay but those moments were too few and far in between. The plot for the most part is ridiculous and doesn't make much sense. At one point, they find what they were looking for through the entire movie through absolute coincidence, unless I missed the part where the treasures EXACT location was revealed. Penelope Cruise (heehee... read your tabloids if you don't get the reference!) doesn't really do anything in this movie when you think about it afterward but she seemed to share a nice chemistry with Matthew. The back and forth patter between Matt Bongos and Bug-Eyed Zahn felt restrained almost. They had a pretty interesting relationship but it was never taken advantage of in the film which is too bad because they alone could have elevated the movie with a more realized characterization of the pair. The direction by Michael Eisner's brat, Breck Eisner, was flat and is proof that just because you're related to someone big in L.A., it doesn't mean you can direct a film, much less be allowed behind a camera, even if it's just to clean out the viewfinder. The editing was bad also but these days, passable editing is widely considered to be a fight scene where you can't tell what's going on. In the end, I think the biggest problem with the movie was the lack of characterization and a plot that didn't engage me in the least.To tell you the truth, I wouldn't mind seeing another Dirk Pitt movie, as long as it's directed by someone other than Mr. Eisner's kid. I think this hero has potential though because Bongo Matt has a great screen presence. I really find the guy to be likable and with a properly used Steve Zahn at his side, they could make some truly thrilling and funny stuff, I think. ""In the right hands"" is a phrase that could and should be applied to the possible future success of a series of Dirk Pitt movies.In the end, the movie wasn't a complete bust and some may find it's lighthearted tone a nice change of pace from the other darker films released as of late. It's watchable to some extent. Some may like the unbelievably ridiculous ways our heroes find to get out of their situations and others may even find this movie to be thrilling enough to be considered an ""edge of your seat"" flick (though I can't really imagine anyone but a really young tyke, say like two years old, finding this to be that exciting). As for me, I found ""Sahara"" about as exciting as waiting for the light to change so I could cross the street.RATING: ** out of *****.",Sahara
85,canuckteach,Cussler will like it better than 'Raise the Titanic',8,12 March 2014,"If you have read the 'Dirk Pitt' novel-series, you always wonder how they would fare as films. Cussler is a brilliant story-teller, linking real-life legends with hero-villain 'save-the-world' action plots. He isn't anxious to cooperate with movie-producers, however, since they typically mess up the script and fill it with CGI and idiot explosions.Sahara was constructed with pride & care by McConaughey, if you listen to the narratives. He's too much of a pretty boy to look like the image of Dirk Pitt in the book, but he is very watchable. Likewise, Zahn does not resemble the linebacker-like Giordino, but the two have good chemistry, and Cruz is quite charming in support. Macy was born to play Sandecker.I believe this is the first 'Dirk Pitt' production to make it to the big screen since 'Raise the Titanic', which was a futuristic novel, accurately predicting the kinds of underwater reconnaissance tools that came into being decades later and were used to find and photograph the real Titanic. 'Titanic' lacked a credible lead (some guy who never acted again, and no one had heard of him before he made this one - sadly, he was a stiff). Action films need a likable lead - Harrison Ford has made a career of it, and he could have done 'Pitt' in his younger years. McConaughey does fine here - he won't be challenging for an Olivier award on the British stage soon, but he is engaging as Pitt, in Sahara.I don't get the people who criticize the plot lines of these Cussler stories, thus demonstrating that they never read a 'Pitt' book. There are many more 'Pitt' books ideal for movie scripts, and I hope that Cussler allows us to enjoy them, even if McConaughey isn't his first choice.",Sahara
86,rparham,Slow moving,6,12 April 2005,"Sahara is one of those films that is neither bad, nor good. It just sits in the middle, teasing you with moments of entertainment, while at the same time not really adding up to a rewarding movie-going experience. In an age of filmic mediocrity, Sahara is a great example of the status quo.Based on a novel by Clive Cussler, Sahara introduces us to adventurer Dirk Pitt (Mathew McConaughey), an employee of former Admiral James Sandecker (William H. Macy) who, while working on a mission off the coast of Africa discovers a rare gold Confederate coin. Pitt is convinced that it came from a Confederate Ironclad named the Texas which escaped from Virginia at the end of the Civil War and sailed across the ocean to end up in Africa. While beginning his search for this relic, accompanied by his lifelong buddy Al Giordino (Steve Zahn), Pitt is joined by two doctors from the World Health Organization, Eva Rojas (Penelope Cruz) and Frank Hopper (Glynn Turman) ,searching for the source of a plague that is spreading in Africa. They quickly discover that the plague may have something to do with businessman Yves Massarde (Lambert Wilson), who is in bed with the dictator of the country where the plague appears to be emanating from, General Kazim (Lennie James).Sahara has several elements that would seem to make for a decent adventure movie: a dashing hero, an amusing sidekick, action sequences, an exotic treasure to search for, and a seemingly hiss-worthy villain. And yet, Sahara can't seem to work up too much excitement. For starters, the film moves at a rather slow pace. Sure, some movies are over-edited, MTV influenced commercials masquerading as movies, but just because the jump cut isn't used every few seconds does not mean that the film aspires to something greater. Adventure movies need to move at a brisk, but not breathtaking pace; Sahara often crawls.The characters are also not very interesting. With a film such as this, your expectations for character development aren't very high, but you should expect to be at least engaged by the people at the core. As affable as both McConaughey and Zahn are, there isn't much depth to either of their roles. They are fun to watch at times, no doubt, and Zahn is more than occasionally funny, but that is about it. I didn't really care whether they made it out of the various situations they found themselves in or not.Another key to an entertaining adventure film is a nasty villain, and while Lambert Wilson and Lennie James give it their all, they aren't that terribly menacing. Wilson especially comes across rather weak, and while the screenplay gives us reason to dislike Kazim, again, he just doesn't live up to what he needs to be.Sahara is the feature directorial debut of commercials director Breck Eisner, and, visually, it's a decent looking film, but, as previously mentioned, he shows some need to work on pacing. If Sahara moved a little faster, had somewhat more engaging characters at it's center, and better villains, it would be more than sufficient for some good entertainment. As it stands, Sahara is more likely to provide sighs than thrills.",Sahara
87,TheMovieMark,I suggest lowering your expectations,6,7 April 2005,"It's not exactly a crowning achievement that one of the things that excited me most about Sahara is that the bright glow from Matthew McConaughey's orange tan provided enough light for me to take notes. That certainly doesn't say a lot about the movie's strong points, but it did prove to be very convenient.Sahara has a lot going for it - humor, explosions, gunfire, lots of things that go boom, and a couple of charming lead characters. Unfortunately, it's missing an immersive, gripping story to really pull you in and hold your interest. There are times, particularly in the middle (aka Sahara Snoozefest 2005), where the action comes to a halt, and a lot of pointless characters say a lot of boring stuff in order to attempt to flesh out a story that just isn't there.Even Stephanie started to fall asleep, and she's a huge Matthew McConaughey fan! Steph: It's true. Matthew, of course, looked great! But I would've enjoyed the movie just as much had there been no sound.The thing I liked most about Sahara is that it doesn't take itself too seriously, and it doesn't expect the viewer to either. Take note that Steve Zahn is playing a former Navy SEAL and you'll know what I'm talking about.I can handle that, and I hope you can too because you're going to be hit with an onslaught of plot contrivances that exist only for the sake of humor. For example, Dirk and Zahn are captured, and a truck is transporting them. They manage to push the truck bed (which they're handcuffed to) out of the back without the two soldiers in the truck noticing. They then walk around the desert carrying the truck bed behind them. The soldiers wouldn't have heard the ENTIRE TRUCK BED FALLING OUT OF THE BACK???? Yeah. Keep your ""suspension of disbelief tool"" handy and you'll be fine in that regard.However, you have to feel sorry for the neglect that elements such as plot, storytelling, and logic must suffer for the sake of the many obligatory shirtless scenes where McConaughey presses his arms against his side in order to make his muscles look bigger than they actually are.Steph: You're just jealous.Why would I be jealous that his arms are smaller than mine? I will admit that it is a good source of entertainment. You can't help but laugh as McConaughey thinks of new and exciting ways to ""casually"" flex his arms. ""Let me stretch my arm out and reach down to get something out of my boat while I fleeeeeeeeeeeex."" The movie is well aware of what it's doing, and that's really its strong suit. Granted, that's not very substantive, so take it for what it's worth.The other thing that works really well in the movie is the relationship between McConaughey and Zahn. They have good chemistry and are quite effective in convincing the viewer that they've known each other since kindergarten.But I'm afraid that's just not enough to carry an entire movie. Especially one that's OVER TWO HOURS LONG! Sheesh. What were they thinking? I'd say an 80-minute runtime would've sufficed. It would have definitely saved me the headache of trying to force myself to stay awake during Sahara Snoozefest 2005.For an introductory movie to a proposed franchise, you've gotta come out of the gates making some noise. You just can't accomplish your mission when people walk out of the theater comparing notes regarding which point in the movie they fell asleep.FACT OF THE DAY: Steve Zahn was cast when filmmakers realized his take on his character was completely in synch with their own. They wanted the character to be comedic without being a huge goofball. Ardent fans, however, aren't as pleased with the casting since the character is described as a ""round, tough little Italian"" who is fairly muscular.Johnny's research shows that nobody in history has ever described Steve Zahn as a muscular little Italian.THE GIST: If you're just dying to see Sahara at the theater then go ahead and lower your expectations right now. There is *some* fun to be had, but overall it just didn't do it for me. This can wait for a rental.Rating: 2.75 (out of 5)",Sahara
88,ThomasColquith,Better than expected,8,1 June 2021,"I had somehow never seen ""Sahara"", or even heard about it until recently. I watched it and found it to be better than I expected. I was prepared for a bad movie due to some of the negative reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised. This is a fun movie with a positive overall tone and nothing too explicit or offensive, just a lot of gunfire. I also appreciated the down to earth themes about the dangers of corruption, greed, and pollution.""Sahara"" is also helped by its unique setting in Africa; it covers territory rarely tread, so I gave it extra points for that effort. Also, FYI, this film is not occultic at all, which I appreciated, no mummies and black magic or voodoo etc.; it was not like ""The Mummy"" as I had feared.

90,Ric-7,Mindless and thoughtless,4,13 April 2005,"You are required to suspend quite a lot of disbelief in order to enjoy this film. There are so many absurdly improbable coincidences, I won't (and probably can't) list them all, but let's just say that if the shirtless McConaughey had not been in the surf with a spear-gun in his hand at the exact moment when Cruz is checking a lighthouse keeper for plague, you could just forget the rest of this film.And the big discovery is a treasure-laden civil war ironclad buried in the middle of the Sahara, and we are given a very, very lame explanation for how it got there: well, there was a big storm which raised the water level, you see; and then there were climate changes. Oh, yeah, sure, over a few decades, from swamp to desert. I think the Sahara pre-dates the Civil War. Of course, that's totally aside from how did an ironclad, running on an engine rather than sails, get from Virginia to Africa? I recall that in Close Encounters of The Third Kind, there was an ocean liner discovered in the Gobi Desert, and I think a UFO would have been a more plausible explanation for the ironclad in the Sahara.In this film, the heroes figure out the origin of a plague and effectively end it, terminate an African civil war, liberate oppressed peoples, save the environment, and discover untold millions in Confederate treasure (when everyone always thought the Confederacy was bankrupt), and all this happens in about two hours. If only McConaughey had been staying at the Hotel Rwanda . . .The villain in this case is French, and I wonder if current politics had anything to do with the selection of the villain's nationality. And the discovery of the cave paintings about the boat--were you reminded of The English Patient? However, even if I had a mind eraser, I could not really enjoy this film because McConaughey and Zahn apparently abandon two saddled camels in the desert with no drinkable water available. The camels were conveniently supplied for plot purposes, and I guess the screenwriter thought they were disposable. I spent the rest of the film wondering if the camels survived. I hope they were rescued by a UFO.",Sahara
91,David_Frames,Lost In Translation,6,24 October 2005,"Poor old Clive Cussler. You write a series of bestselling adventure novels, sit back and feel sure that Hollywood will be falling over themselves to buy them up. If just one proves to be a smash hit you've struck pay-dirt - the suits will be back for one every two years and before you can say 'lucrative Francaise' your hero Dirk Pitt (No comment) will uttered in the same breath as James Bond. Well that was back in 1976 and Clive had to wait a while for the cameras to start rolling on one of his tomes. Sadly for Cussler when the moment came it wasn't the likes of Richard Zanuck calling but Fatty Grade, a man with as much story telling acumen as Steven Hawking on a low battery. Grade made such a frightening, catastrophic botch job of Raise the Titanic that Cussler wanted his name taken off it, in fact he probably wanted the cast and crew drowned in the North Atlantic. You can imagine the premiere with the author's heart slowly breaking as his creation was murdered before a audience of friends and critics. Bond had been immortalised by Sean Connery but Pitt was unmemorably played by Richard Jordan. Alright so the film was less fun than being a third class vagrant on the real Titanic when the lifeboats were filling up but an iconic character might have turned it around. With the moment gone and Cussler's novels tarnished by screen-failure it seemed to be the film series that never was but fast-forward 25 years and Paramount thought they'd have another go at it by adapting Sahara - potentially less expensive than Raise the Titanic, the plot of which had been factually sodomised but more risky as there was no obvious hook to reel in Pitt-ignorant punters. So is Pitt finally go? Well, a bit. Like the previous Cussler adaptation it doesn't have a great deal in common with the novel bar the bare bones of the plot but this one actually has some entertainment value. Mindless certainly, though bits of Cussler's more weighty approach sometimes get though but a story involving the WHO (thats the world health organisation not Roger Daltry and co.), environmental pollution and all the rest of it seems like clumsy background shading given the jokey tone of the screenplay. Cussler's Pitt is something of a laconic all-rounder. Here he's the folksy, Southern charm of Matthew Macognahognahog - a shock as I thought he died and I suspect many of you had to. Where the hell has he been for the last 5 years? Still never mind, he's here now and in search of that recurring action role that flummoxed the likes of Val Kilmer and Alec Baldwin. The search goes on, primarily because Sahara is just fine but unfortunately never great. Bret Eisner direction doesn't make too much of the action while the story feels a bit flimsy - its guts ripped out in an effort to manufacture a 21st Indiana Jones. Jones' exploits had verve, real energy and virtuoso direction on their side - fun never looked so effortless. Sahara has none of that magic. Its a two star flick (which I've given 6 stars)with an added star for the Raise the Titanic reference in the opening credits. A watchable adventure but it gives you nothing that suggests a new Pitt-slog would be welcome every couple of years. Its a shame because the potential in those books is enormous. If Hollywood would stop dumbing them down you'd have a very attractive proposition on your hands and the words 'A Dirk Pitt Adventure' might be a promise instead a threat. They best hurry though, Cussler will want to live to see that day and he's not getting any younger...or happier for that matter.",Sahara

Yes, so lots of things happen that I probably wasn't aware of, because I was asleep the whole time.So, this Wannabe-Indiana Jones movie has an interesting beginning that seems way too short. The middle seems way too long. When the adventure finally starts, nothing interesting happens for a while, and the audience desperately waits for an action scene. When the action scene comes, it ends up being nothing more than a mere slam-bang sequence. The audience waits some more, and becomes disappointed more. The scenes in between are too stretched out and boring. The final action scene is pretty bad too. Two people being chased by a helicopter isn't exactly the best idea somebody can come up with.

The plot is ditchwater dull, involving, God, I don't know, Nazi Confederate gold and fawningly grateful Sambos and evil Muslim Ninjas or something. Really. Could. Not. Care. Less.Cruz, while I find her an unattractive and unengaging knock-off of Valeria Golino, does at least have some raw charisma. The ""star"", whose name I can't even remember, looks like a stoner, and mails in a performance that inclines me to inform him that no, I do not want fries with that. Everyone else is merely on screen, but not particularly enthused about it. This is a banker film: it's making or breaking nobody's career.The score is pretty much random. It veers between James Bond riffs and a sort of weird techno version of Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Teamed with a dialogue that seems to involve shouting out the stage directions, the main effect is to annoy rather than engage.I really can't bring myself to put more effort into this review than the cast and crew put into the film itself.

97,hoernkeem,"Sahara review (2005, Breck Eisner) Farfetched but rollicking guilty pleasure adventure tale",7,11 February 2021,"Sahara (2005, Breck Eisner)
When 'Sahara' was released it wasn't very well received by critics nor did it make much money at the box office. Maybe it is a bit of a guilty pleasure, but I enjoyed this film quite a bit. I am not quite sure how intelligent the plot is. You can probably poke a bunch of holes in it without trying too hard, but I still found it a quite entertaining flight of fancy if you flex your suspension of disbelief a bit. I think the film is very well cast. Matthew McConaughey has great charisma as treasure hunter Dirk Pitt made famous in numerous novels by Clive Cussler, and while Steve Zahn doesn't quite meet book specs of sidekick Al Giordino he works really well as a Guy Friday and comic relief. Penelope Cruz, William H. Macy and Delroy Lindo among others round out a decently impressive cast.
If you know anything about Dirk Pitt adventure novels they all follow the same basic template which is combining some historical treasure mystery with a modern day terrorist/espionage intrigue plot, and both usually come to common climax. Here the historical mystery revolves around a lost confederate ironclad ship which was reported to have somehow made it all the way to Africa. This has been sort of a passion of Pitt's for a while and gets revisited whenever they are in Africa. Along with that some sort of mysterious plague style illness is spiking in western Africa causing the W.H.O. in the form of Penelope Cruz to investigate. She manages to run afoul of local warlords and her and Pitt get wrapped up in each other's quests as he searches for a long lost ghost ship in a desert and she searches for the source of a deadly plague. While the plot is outlandish it seems clear that everyone on screen is enjoying the hell out of themselves and having a good time producing a fairly simple adventure/treasure hunt sort of film. I really enjoyed everyone in their roles. I thought the plot had plenty of action, tension and humor and it never really dragged. It was up tempo and if you just let yourself go you can enjoy this as a fun popcorn action adventure flick.
I really wish this would have caught on as there are a bunch of Pitt novels to mine material from for continued adventures, and typically big budget adventure films done well can lead to good reviews and hefty box office receipts. For whatever reason though 'Sahara' did not capture public attention or imagination and wound up being a box office dud. To further complicate the matter Cussler battled the production company in court over the adaptation which along with the cruddy box office ostensibly destroyed any chance of further Dirk Pitt adventures which is a shame because I thought the core cast here was very good with wonderful chemistry and this is a world that certainly could have been built upon. Also we just don't get very many blockbuster style adventure films in the Indiana Jones mold and I greatly enjoy what we do get even if that enjoyment is in the guilty pleasure realm. Even if you can criticize the film's plot and science and such to no end the film is clearly well made. So while I am sure 'Sahara' has plenty of negative reviews and plenty of reasons to pick it apart I found this film a lot of fun and very enjoyable and I wish it had done well enough to spawn sequels.

98,jaxbubba,Wait for the Video,4,4 May 2005,"This film is combination Raiders of the Lost Ark meets Outbreak. I really believed the Raider's storyline was really more interesting than the Outbreak storyline; however, most of the film deals with the epidemic of industrial pollution occurring in Africa and leaves the ironclad storyline for fluff and filler.The movie features Matthew McConaughey (Dirk Pitt) and Steve Zahn (Al Giordino) as a couple of ex-navy seals turned fortune hunters working for William H. Macy, who we can only assume was their former commander (Admiral Jim Sandecker). Thrown into the mix are Penélope Cruz (Eva Rojas) and Glynn Turman (Dr. Frank Hopper) as a couple World Health Organization (WHO) medical doctors.Dirk Pitt has been in search of an elusive ironclad, which supposedly transverse the Atlantic Ocean some 150 years prior, at the time of the Civil War. Every time Pitt's endeavors bring him to Africa, it rekindles his desire to find this monumental discovery.While traveling up the Euphrates, Dirk and Al are met with opposition; and immediately Dirk determines it's because they were traveling with the two WHO doctors. Equipped with only a camel and his trusty cohort AL, Dirk Pitt changes his desires of finding his intangible watercraft to locating, helping, and rescuing the medical team.Again, of the two story lines, the search for the Civil War ship seemed much more intriguing; however, the solar powered waste disposal plant was interesting to look at.

99,Chromium_5,I wish Matthew McConaughey would get struck by lightning,6,30 April 2005,"When I kept seeing this getting compared to the Indiana Jones movies, I had to see it. Well, if the movie producers honestly think Matthew McConaughey is the next Harrison Ford, God help us. Matt has no screen presence whatsoever. He can't get into character, he can't deliver lines believably... he really can't do much of anything except stand there and look good. Let me tell you why Ford became such a hit: he had SUBSTANCE. He had sex appeal too, but that was greatly helped by his tough, take-no-crap personality. McConaughey is straight out of an Ambercrombie and Fitch ad, standing there with his fake tan, ridiculously white teeth (I think he was wearing Crest strips), and cute little beads and bracelets. The few times in the movie where he showed traces of an actual personality, it was a direct copy of every character Owen Wilson has ever played (I think Wilson should sue for identity theft). And don't even get me started on that bland bimbo Penelope Cruz.That's not to say I didn't get SOME enjoyment out of the movie. The action scenes where reasonably exciting, and Steve Zahn was a good sidekick, funny but also able to defend himself (and Lord knows we don't get to see THAT too often). And William H. Macy is always fun to watch, no matter what movie he's in. I suppose it's worth going to if you're in the mood for some fast-paced, mindless action... I just wish it had a memorable hero instead of some cardboard cutout like McConaughey. Oh well. I guess we'll have to wait for the sequel.",Sahara

Hart (based on the novel by Clive Cussler) Producers: Stephanie Austin, Howard Baldwin, Karen Elise Baldwin, Mace Neufeld Cinematography: Seamus McGarvey Editing: Andrew MacRitchie Music: Clint Mansell U.S. Distributor: Paramount PicturesIn my opinion, the adventure genre of cinema has been in a slow, sad decline since Indiana Jones. Even the James Bond series has seemed to dwindle into CGI boredom. It's been too long since a good adventure hero has sidled into my local multiplex with guns at his sides and dozens of foreign evil masterminds hot on his heels. We've been treated to such disasters as Lara Croft, Charlie's Angels, and a seemingly endless line of shoddy comic book adaptations like Elektra. But finally it seems that a film has got the genre right. Sahara and its wild Boy Scout duo Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino work the genre as it needs to be worked. The film moves with reckless abandon, senseless logic, and characters that have nothing but experience and their savvy to get them out of hopelessly stupid situations. It may not be art, but Sahara is a whole lot of fun. The film follows Dirk Pitt (Matthew McConaughey) and his buddy Al Giordino (Steve Zahn) on a wild treasure hunt to find a lost Civil War Ironclad Battleship buried in Africa. Along the way they meet up with Dr. Frank Hopper (Glynn Turman) and Eva Rojas (Penelope Cruz) from the World Health Organization researching a recent outbreak of a mysterious and fatal disease. Hitching a ride with Dirk, the group sets off down the Niger River into the Civil War crazed nation of Mali. The four separate, leaving Frank and Eva in a local village for research, and Dirk with a squad of speedboats and machine-gun toting soldiers chasing after his boat. Mali's ruling warlord, Kazim, discovers that Frank and Eva's research may jeopardize his finances and orders their execution. Dirk, having escaped the speedboats, now must put his treasure hunt on hold and rescue the pretty girl. Most of the fun from Sahara comes from director Breck Eisner's decision to shave off all the unnecessary elements of the typical adventure film. Instead of fluffing the film with obligatory sappy love scenes between the sexy doctor and the sly hero, Eisner presents cute one-liners and courteously gives Cruz some clothes instead of the usual bikini. The girl's a real character, not just another notch on the hero's belt. And instead of creating useless strife between Dirk and Al, Eisner sticks to Cussler's material and makes them argue in witty, playful banter. Eisner clearly has a handle on the genre and knows how to use it without letting the film fall into auto-pilot. But part of that must be owed to Clive Cussler, the author of the book Sahara is based off of. Having read a few of the Dirk Pitt adventures myself, I'll have to agree with Cussler's decision to disown the screenplay adaptation. Novel-Dirk is slick and suave (think a James Bond who shops at REI). But Film-Dirk is more of a mix between a Boy Scout and a Frat Boy. Sounds like a painful mix, I know, but the resulting character is both likable and action savvy. And just for comparisons sake, I always pictured Al played by Cheech Marin, making the casting choice of Steve Zahn an obvious departure. But McConaughey and Zahn work well as an All-American action/comedy duo, building a nice feeling of camaraderie. And still present is Cussler's unbelievably breakneck pacing and illogical plotting. Very little of the stunts pulled in Sahara make sense according to the basic laws of physics, but there's no denying that they look and sound spectacular. The stunt work, camera work, and sound editing are all second to none in Sahara. And while we're on the topic, Sahara features one of the most delicately and skillfully chosen soundtracks I've heard for a while. Technically, Sahara is a great piece of work.Sure, there will be times when you'll shake your head at the logic this film jumps, but I'm sure you'll find logic isn't something Sahara is all too concerned about. All it's concerned with is having fun. And fun is certainly what you'll have. -Sam Osborn of www.samseescinema.com",Sahara

In this simple-minded insult to readers, the depth of characterization and plot profundity are absent, as well as any spirit of adventure and fun. These are ripped-out and the imagination of one of America's greatest writers of this type of fiction is buried beneath a towering mess of stupidity. What remains is a generic, ridiculous, and boring pile of sterile Sahara sand, lifeless, uninvolving, and vastly empty. It is typical that those who treasure a literary masterpiece are usually disappointed by cinematic interpretations of those works. However, in this case a pure, unadulterated outrage and contempt for the film is entirely justified and can't be understated. This is a shocking and repugnant slap in the audiences' face and efforts such as this contemptible assault on the intellect of the people who admire Clive Cussler and his contribution to American letters must never be allowed to happen again! At least Raise the Titanic was a sincere and heartfelt attempt to bring that masterwork to the screen, however flawed and miscast it might have been. The closing scenes of that film at least captured the surprise ending and the overwhelming emotion of the novel's conclusion. The ending of Sahara, the movie, left readers stunned by the omission of one of the finest pieces of writing ever published! It was as if the very soul of the book was torn from between the covers and tossed aside as irrelevant. That remains one of the most horrifying, malicious ""creative"" choices ever to be made in cinematic history! Because of what this motion picture is and the filmic atrocity committed by those responsible for it, the possibility of Cussler's work ever being brought satisfactorily to theatres in a way that truly does justice to the author's genius is now zero. It is a very real shame and as stated before, a complete outrage this was permitted to happen. One can only most heartfully hope that the film will not serve as anyone's introduction to the majestic character of Dirk Pitt and deter any reader from treating themselves to a stunning journey into the fantastically creative world of Clive Cussler.",Sahara
106,Boggman,Gimme a break!,3,26 September 2005,"Sahara didn't do much for this reviewer. The performances were drab, the story was convoluted, and really....the movie was just boring overall.I just didn't care about these characters, the plot (something to do with the worldwide poisoning of the water supply...blah blah blah), or what was going to happen next. After about 45 minutes into the movie, all I began to care about was when it would end.Sure the movie is scenic and the backdrop is quite impressive, but without any good plot or characters to involve myself with....""Sahara"" ended up failing miserably.I'd put this movie right up there with ""National Treasure""... which isn't saying much at all.Just a big ol' mess from start to finish.Disappointing!",Sahara
107,boe_dye,"not bad, not great, but somewhere in between.",7,13 September 2007,"Seven sounds like a good round number for this movie.For the most part, it was pretty entertaining. The characters were delightfully well portrayed, and the action sequences were good, but not over the top. The music fit strangely well also.The premise was a rather odd one, a deep sea ""indiana jones"" type goes off to look for a civil war boat that some how made it to Africa is certainly and interesting tripe of a story.But why I don't think that this movie was great was because somewhere between the start and finish of the film (go figure), the storyline somewhat merged from an archaeological adventure to a we must save the planet from pollution.Not that that is a bad thing, it was just unexpected. But not so unexpected that it doesn't fit because as I said, it merged. So instead of having a subplot, you now have a dual plot.It is a decent renter, or maybe a purchase if you can find it for 10 bucks.",Sahara
108,nzswanny,"Slow starting, but otherwise, highly underrated",10,3 September 2016,"You don't get much adventure movies like this anymore in the 21st century, so I was surprised to find that this movie reminded me of 80's adventure movies. The plot revolves around a poisoned river in the Sahara desert, and three treasure hunters try to save the day. Armed with lots of action, and a bit too much humour, you'll be entertained from the first...30 minutes. The movie starts off a bit slow, and the first half an hour is stretched out a bit too much, however, if you can cope with a slow and awkward start to being entertained, I think this is the ideal adventure movie for you (if you're a fan of the books however, you may want to reconsider watching this).Overall, I rate this a 7.9/10!",Sahara
109,andrewmerritt-31652,A guilty pleasure adventure movie,8,8 December 2019,"Sahara stars Matthew McConaughey, Penelope Cruz, Steve Zahn, and is based off of the popular book by Clive Cussler. The film revolves around treasure explorer Dirk Pitt who is searching for a lost Civil War ship, while helping a WHO doctor investigating a mysterious plague. This movie is like Indiana Jones and James Bond had a love child. I wrote of review of Octopussy saying that it was more Indiana Jones and less James Bond. This is a perfect example of how you combine Indiana Jones and James Bond into one movie. Sure the movie isn't perfect without it's flaws, but I applaud it for not trying so hard to be two different types of franchises. It has a perfect balance of Indiana Jones and James Bond. This is more of your basic Indiana Jones and James Bond elements with likeable characters and one-dimensional James Bond villains that don't overact and are still entertaining to watch. But the problem I have with this is why all the hate Hollywood? Even though that this movie is one of the most expensive movies to bomb at the box office and Clive Cussler getting into arguments over creative differences with Hollywood its still an entertaining movie. I've never read the book before, but from what I read the book is way more bloody and violent than the movie. But in the end it's still a fantastic adventure and that's all that matters to me. Just because certain things from the book don't make it into the movie doesn't mean the movie can't be entertaining. And a movie can still be entertaining if originally the movie was planned for an R rating, but switched over to a PG-13 rating, but done correctly. Some cases can be made, but I feel that if those bloody and violent aspects from the book were in the movie, then it would lose its magic and be an awkward mess. And I don't want this to be an awkward mess because I enjoyed this journey and I don't want it spoiled over creative differences. So in the end I will say that this is worth watching to the point where you should ignore the negative reviews, Rotten Tomatoes, and the trailer because that doesn't do it justice.",Sahara
110,eamon-hennedy,"Blockbuster fun, I loved it.",8,20 April 2005,"A wonderful mixture of old fashioned movie adventure values with the high octane adrenalin rush of a Bond film or Bruckheimer/Bay production, Sahara proves to be two hours of wonderful fun, the type of action movie you don't think they make anymore, one that puts aside the incessant use of CGI and and does it all old school with stunts and chase sequences. Of course the story is as old as the hills and involves treasure hunters, corrupt businessmen, a very intelligent love interest and an evil political leader, but who cares because this is so much fun.First of, Clive Cussler fans will more than likely hate it. The novels are more serious affairs, whereas Brent Eisner has decided to turns the Dirk Pitt character and his partner Al into a Hollywood buddy combination with comedic chemistry and incessant bickering in the middle of the action sequences. Of course this is something I love in my action movies and the film has it all. Matthew McConaghey seems to be having one hell of a time, in fact the whole cast does, but it is Steve Zhan who runs away with the best performance as Al who gets all the best lines and comedy scenarios. Penenlope Cruz makes a lovely love interest, Lambert Wilson once again gets to play a smarmy villain (can't Hollywood give him anything else, he was good as The Merovingian in The Matrix Reloaded/Revolutions but he is bound to be able to play something else), while as always William H Macy gets to play the straight roll of the boss, but as always gets to play it in his own formidable style.Overall I loved Sahara. Don't expect to see it at the Oscars next year, but do expect two hours of great, unadulterated fun.",Sahara
111,Mr_PCM,Entertaining but over-baked and over-thought,7,10 April 2005,"The problem with Sahara lies in the fact that it does not know what it wants to be: Indiana Jones-style adventure looking for treasure, or James Bond-type mission against a corrupt government, or pollution morality tale, or all of the above, or something else completely. It thus becomes rather unclear what our hero's objective is - and for an action adventure, this is never a good thing.There are simply too many plot strands. Any plot involving the WHO is always going to put a different spin on a standard adventure story. Whilst we tend to stay with the main characters through the majority of the film, what their motives are and where they are going are in a constant state of flux.Our hero is Matthew McConaughey's Dirk Pitt - basically a treasure hunter. He is aided and abetted by a trusty wisecracking comedy sidekick Al Giordino(Steve Zahn) and the required pretty damsel Eva Rojas (Penelope Cruz). The bad guy is a military despot (Lennie James), and just in case you were unclear he was the baddie, he comes accompanied with a heartless French businessman (Lambert Wilson). So far all clear? Next, McConaughey and Zahn go off into the desert to dig up a metal ship which is buried there (don't ask) whilst Cruz sets off into the heart of Mali (the despotic regime) to fight a mystery disease ravaging the population. After much posturing and large bangs (another requirement for a film such as this) Cruz finds herself in need of rescuing, as most pretty damsels are prone to do, so our heroes show up and do just this. So far so simple. Now it becomes unclear what they are going to do next - are they going to search for the treasure or try to fight this disease? Well both it seems. Conveniently, everything they are looking for seem to all be within 100 metres of each other. More fighting and explosions ensue into the climax. With me so far? Big bangs, a defeated bad guy and a romantic sunset beckon for our heroes, and can i smell a franchise following closely behind? McConaughey is likable but bland in the action film, and Zahn plays the sidekick from the textbook, with cracks at carefully timed intervals. Cruz begins as a thinking man's totty, with glasses (of course  glasses are a sign of intelligence), hair tied back and being a doctor. The primness is soon lost however as she gets stuck in with the boys on their adventure sans glasses (she must wear contacts). The stars all do their job without being spectacular. But in a convoluted plot they try their best.But OK, what are the positives? If all you need for entertainment is a film where the good guy is a rugged American hero with a comedy sidekick and pretty girl on the arm and who gets to shoot people and blow things up then this is for you (as long as you don't concentrate too much, or even think too hard about it at all). Fortunately the differing plot strands are easy to follow, so you shouldn't have to think to hard. Although not exactly mindless, it provides a couple of hours of amusement for the guys - and make no mistake, this film is clearly guy-oriented. Can't be faulted for lack of effort, but tries to be too clever, and ends up getting itself confused over what it wants to be. Be that as it may, expect a sequel.",Sahara
112,kevinmorice,Better than expected,8,6 April 2008,"It does exactly what you would expect from a buddy action movie in the Sahara desert. It's not an Oscar candidate, but then it isn't based on a literary classic now is it? Good buddies, one too good to be true, one slightly geeky but perfectly useful sidekick, one hot girl, plenty of action, good fight scenes and a story stretched just about far enough to fit what they want to squeeze in.Plenty of action movie clichés, plenty of irreverent humour to the point that it even makes fun of it's own clichés.Doesn't take itself too seriously.Thumping good soundtrack.I am quite surprised that it isn't better appreciated for what it is.",Sahara
113,Critical Eye UK,Film making at its most honest,2,7 April 2006,"'You can do what you want in Africa,' a character says in 'Sahara'. 'Africa doesn't matter.' And so the movie proves: you can get away with anything if you've a co-equal contempt for the place you're filming and for the audiences to whom your 'product' will be served.It's not all bad, of course. There's no swearing, and boy, what a relief that is. No sex, either, so. . . ditto. But there's no plot, either, no coherence, no sense, no humour, and no interest.Clive Cussler apparently disowned the movie even before it was released, an act some might find rich given that for many enthusiasts of quality books, Cussler's 'novels' and their preposterously-named central character are fit only for dis-owning, anyway.How ironic, then, that the one genre which might've rescued the other -- film rescuing book -- fails so completely.Still: for those capable of distinguishing between gold and dross, there's much to relish in the increasingly-desperate 'boat battle' sequence, one which doesn't merely plunder the great Bond movies of yesteryear. . . but goes so far as to sample John Barry's original score and then insert it into its own soundtrack.But apparently, you can get away with anything in Africa.",Sahara
114,crowrobot,I'm with Ebert on this one....,10,8 May 2005,"Currently, Sahara is not doing well at the box office, which is a shame, and the critics hated it, which is also a shame. It's a hugely entertaining thrill ride, and it's never boring.The plot is preposterous, but so what? Action movies often have dumb plots, but this movie doesn't take itself too seriously. This is a good thing, because if a movie with sunken Civil War ironclads, poisonous toxic chemicals in the desert, and a windsurfer made out of an ancient crashed plane takes itself seriously, the result is tedious and boooooring. Thankfully, this movie doesn't, and that is a blessing.All the cast performs excellently: Matthew McConaghuey is perfect as action hero Dirk Pitt, Steve Zahn is once again a goofy sidekick, but he's actually given a chance to get in on the action (when was the last time you saw Zahn shoot a guy?), and it's a refreshing change. Penelope Cruz is oh-so-lovely, William H. Macy is gruffly charming as McConaghuey and Zahn's boss, and he reminded me of his work last year in ""Cellular"". Lambert Wilson has now cemented his place as ""the French bad guy"" in Hollywood, and Delroy Lindo shows up as a CIA agent.The action is well done, and first-time director Breck Eisner handles this material admirably. Add in a booming score, and you've got yourself one grand time of a movie.",Sahara
115,cwrdlylyn,SAHARA: A Complete Waste Of Some Untalented Actor's Time...,1,4 April 2006,"SAHARA I try to always offer some intelligent commentary as to what makes a film bad in my eyes... however, I almost can't muster the energy to attempt this when it comes to SAHARA. If a film won't bother to put effort into it's creation, why should I bother putting effort into it's review.Simply put, SAHARA is everything a blockbuster action/adventure movie shouldn't be... boring!!!!!!! Everything is painfully cliché here. The banter between Steve Zahn (playing a role that could be described as a ""Steve Zahn type, but drained of all comedic ability"") and Matthew McConaughey is painfully unfunny and unnatural. In the middle of a deadly confrontation they'll still make jokes about beer and **** like that... doesn't happen, and pretending it does doesn't make this trash any better.Overall, it all just felt like they were trying to make THE CONSTANT GARDENER mixed with THE MUMMY and it just didn't work at all. There was no artistic coherency here. Performances were all phoned in, every plot development was predictable, direction awful, and the script painful.To top it all off, the movie was more than 2 hours long and I could call the ending within the first few minutes. Finally, none of it makes sense. For a film this terrible it was way too confusing and complicated. It seems like the screenwriter might have thought the amateur quality would be masked by tons of characters, lots of twists, and lots of medical jargon. Well all it did was make me dislike the movie more.Nearly as bad as CRASH, and for completely different reasons...... F ...",Sahara
116,aeo,Wait for the release on video.,3,14 April 2005,"I give this 3 stars out of 10.The acting is fine and the action was decent. The problem with this movie is that it tries to do and tell too many things and the movie clearly suffers for it. First, the story about treasure hunting was fine, even though the story of a US Confederate ship ending up in a region in Africa was far-fetched but whatever. Then the movie starts talking about a mass plague in a civil war torn African country where an environmental dumping on a mass scale is going on. This is too much.I gave this 3 stars rather than 1 because of the movies' use of real location rather than use some computer graphic simulated scenery. Using real scenery does make the movie a bit more palatable, although if they would have just dealt with one or two concepts and developed that, then the movie would have been better.",Sahara
117,98nurdinm-1,"Very enjoyable! Next one, please!",8,19 April 2005,"I am a fan of the Dirk Pitt novels. I'm not the BIGGEST fan of all time, that much is true - after all, I hadn't read the book on which this is based before watching this movie - but I still had mixed feelings about this film beforehand. There had been a lot of negativity towards this film since the early stages, with some person writing on this very website that ""'Sahara'is going to SUCK!""Well I'm sorry to say that you are 100% WRONG, my friend. ""Sahara"" sucks less than an alligator who has lost all its teeth in a freak accident involving the back side of a boat and so has to try and suck its victims to death by using lots and lots of little tiny red and white striped straws, but has just received a brand new set of metal dentures for him to chomp his way mercilessly through human and animal alike with an evil glint in his eyes and an unquenchable hunger for flesh. And if that's not a positive comment, then I don't know what is.""Sahara"" tells the story of our man Pitt (Matthew McConaghuey) and his quest to find the long-lost Civil War ship, the Texas, that is somehow buried in the Sahara Desert. He is joined by his pals Al Giordino (Steve Zhan) and Rudi Gunn (Rainn Wilson) on a boat lent to them by the Director of NUMA, Admiral Sandecker (William H Macy). He is also joined by Eva Rojas (Penelope Cruz), a doctor working for the World Health Organisation who has discovered a mysterious plague that is sweeping through Africa. They soon discover that their quests are linked in very sinister ways...I warn any die hard Pitt fans right now - this film does not follow the book exactly. But then you would know about that, particularly considering the fuss that Clive Cussler is kicking up over it at the moment. But then you have to consider this point: I don't think any film could do one of Cussler's books justice. It would take a trilogy to completely make the actual film of ""Sahara"". What the director is trying to do here, and it is something that I think he does well, is give the audience a very good introduction into the world of this famous character. He has taken all the necessary elements of the plot and has created a very entertaining film. The performances from the main characters help as well. Matthew McConaghuey is very good as Pitt, and Zhan is the funniest Giordino that I had ever imagined. The chemistry between these two works extremely well, and it is worth noting that the two guys bonded before filming was to start so that they could get that chemistry. It really does work. I'm not a particular fan of method acting most of the time, but this type helped the film a lot.Rainn Wilson, whom some of you may remember from ""Six Feet Under"", is a nerdy but entertaining Gunn. William H Macy has always been a particular favourite of mine, and to see him as Sandecker is the icing on the cake. As for Penelope Cruz - I'm still not sure. She has been receiving a lot of negative press recently, and there is nothing wrong with her portrayal of Eva. She is a confidant, strong, independent woman who fits well in Cussler's world. But maybe we should have seen a bit more of her looking after herself rather than been saved by Pitt all the time.The baddies in the film were an interesting mix. Lambert Wilson had his moments as the French industrialist whose toxic waste plant holds the key to the pollution in the rivers, but he came off rather weakly as a bad guy. The last time we see him got a particular laugh and cheer from the audience, however, as you are left with the impression that he becomes a victim of his own medicine. The warmongering dictator of the country where the Texas is buried is played with considerable relish by Lennie James. His is a much more successful portrayal of cold-heartiness, but you feel like you want to see more of this. The only real example is his personal murder of Eva's colleague. It is obvious that this is a man to be hated, so let's have something to hate him for.Having said that, however, we do not want too much of it. Cussler has often said that Pitt is a hero for young and old alike. The 12A certificate - or PG-13 if you are an American reading this - is very well kept and makes it accessible for all ages. Except the really young, though - that would be silly.In conclusion, although it does start off slowly, this film builds up to be a fantastic romp. The music, sometimes very Bondian at times, is exciting, the characters are mostly excellently portrayed, and the story is wrapped up nicely. McConeghuey has said that he does not want this to be a one-film deal: from the beginning he has set out to do a franchise.In my opinion, Mr Cussler, I'm a great fan of your work, but stop whining. The film is introducing thousands more to your wonderful character. And, to be perfectly and simply honest with you, I cannot wait for the next instalment!8/10",Sahara

119,kismit,If you enjoyed the movie at all read the book. The director didn't!,5,12 August 2006,"If you are a Clive Cussler fan you will probably not like the film. It reminds me of the early Golan Globus stuff with Chuck Norris. Long on action, short on script, and corners in the budget cut wherever possible. Cussler is not a gifted writer, but rather an idea man. His books thread a bunch of interesting subplots together to make a loosely connected whole. They are not heavy reading by any means and should adapt fairly well to the screen. There was so much sliced out of this story it bears only a slight resemblance to the story it was based on, as Cussler himself has commented. Too bad because the hack job done on Sahara will likely prevent any further Dirk Pitt adventures from becoming movies. McConnaghy does do a passable job as the main character and could have made this a great franchise.",Sahara

This is actually a real good movie. The cast in this movie was superb. The comedy of Steve Zahn added a fresh new element to the movie.

Let me tell these people not to read the book because it will make even less sense. Myself, I love Clive Cussler and his Dirk Pitt novels and this was a decent attempt to create a movie from one. (There was a previous attempt with Raise the Titanic but even high star power couldn't save that flop.) Personally if I could have picked the cast of the main characters I am not sure I would have chosen McCon. and Zahn but they worked. They missed a bunch of classic Dirkisms and Alisms that took away away some of their mystique but overall did a passing job. If you liked the movie you will love the book.

122,~AleXa~,Mediocrity in the midst of an action/adventure,6,4 September 2005,"Okay, let me start off by saying that I don't think in this day and age that one can attempt to make movies like that of Indiana Jones without adding SOME hint of credibility. I mean, let's face it, the majority of audiences are actually quite intelligent, so blatant, easily-fixable plot holes just won't fly.Now, let me also add that I have not read any of the Dirk Pitt novels so I have nothing to compare it to, but what I *do* know is that most everything in the film had Clive Cussler's (author of the novel the movie was based on) stamp of approval, from the screenplay to the cast to the specific look of the actors. So that being considered, this movie did NOT seem true to the original material, much less to the realm of believability.I thought I knew what to expect from this film--pretty much nothing, short of a half-decent adventure movie. But I was so frustrated by inexcusable plot holes that I couldn't completely enjoy the light comedy or action scenes. In classic Hollywood tradition, all the action sequences were stretched out so that everything had perfect timing; the predictability of most scenes was enough to make even the most casual observer scoff.So basically, through the first 30 minutes, it was unclear what exactly the point of the opening scene was, which made the film hard to get into. It wasn't until the first boat scene that I actually became interested. The whole film was just so vague and poorly put together, and despite the fact that the crew went to over 100 different locations, you feel like you just keep seeing the same three over and over.Overall, the film just seems to try to undertake too many avenues and can't seem to fulfill any of them. There's action, but it's quite repetitive; there's adventure, but it mimics that of other films, they feign romance, but it's really not there at all; there's comedy, but it's overshadowed by plot holes, there's relatable characters, but the focus on action-packed stunt scenes leaves them feeling a bit two-dimensional, and there's direction, but it's only allowed to shine in two sequences. Not to mention an all-star cast that just seems wasted on a poorly-developed screenplay. I find it so sad that a film that was given so much care and devotion does not convey this at all. McConaughey spent 7 years trying to get this film on its feet, the author of the novel was the technical adviser and took care to see that actors that embodied the roles were cast and even made sure they met the physical description, and the director made it a point to make sure the roles of the 3 leads were equal, as well took time to find many spectacular locations and employ over 5,000 extras, and saw to it that the stunt scenes were in fact live-action and *not* CGI.Now I hate to think that all that effort was for naught, but it does seem that way. When you take out all the parts that seem to parallel Indiana Jones, James Bond, and The Mummy as well as the numerous blatant plot holes, you don't have much of anything left. True, it has its moments, but I would not go so far as to describe it as 'original' or 'an action-packed adventure'. By the end, I was left feeling disengaged, not caring that I ever knew of the characters or the predicament, and a bit frustrated about the level of suspension of belief the film begs of the viewer. Furthermore, there's nothing special in the film that would evoke me to ever see it again, short of seeing Matthew McConaughey, but if that's all I desire, I'd much sooner see How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days or A Time To Kill. Action/Adventure is my all-time fave genre, and as such, I can safely say this is supremely mediocre in that respect.VERDICT: Mildly entertaining if you can overlook the flaws; definitely worth the rental fee, but don't expect too much from this bland adventure.5.5 out of 10.0",Sahara
123,psi_fla,Ho hum,5,9 April 2005,"Directed by: Breck Eisner Starring: Matthew McConaughey, Steve Zahn, Penelope Cruz, Lambert Wilson, Delroy Lindo, William H. Macy, Rainn Wilson Sahara is a run-of-the-mill action adventure flick that borrows heavily from the best of James Bond and Indiana Jones. It has a cast lacking charisma and an incoherent plot that isn't worth thinking about.I've made the film sound pretty derivative and pointless so far, haven't I? Well, derivative it undoubtedly is. Regarding its pointlessness, I'm not so sure. It does have some really good jokes and a few wonderfully staged action sequences. That's perfectly alright if you're into those kind of films and are looking for a tolerable diversion for an empty evening. But we should expect modern blockbusters to be more than just ""tolerable diversions"". Having characters worth caring about, for example, goes a long way. As does not having such clueless bad guys and huge plot holes that are hard to ignore.For what it's worth, Sahara's based on a novel (although you wouldn't think so when watching it). It tells the story of Dirk Pitt (Matthew McConaughey) who is in Africa at the same time as World Health Organisation doctor Eva Rojas (Penelope Cruz). He's searching for treasure, she's looking for the cure for an epidemic. By chance, their paths cross. This leads them to eventually uncover a deadly scheme, and to attempt to stop whoever's behind it.The acting by the leads in this film will have many wishing that The Mummy's leads (Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz and John Hannah) had been in the lead roles instead. I can't believe that I once thought of Penelope Cruz as a talented and radiant performer. Here she is both wooden and unsexy. Matthew McConaughey lacks any kind of presence as an action hero. Indeed, of the three leads, only Steve Zahn manages to come away with any kind of credit, and that is mostly from the comic relief he provides. He's fun to watch, as is Rainn Wilson (who's currently acting like Gareth Keenan in the American version of ""The Office""). Sadly, their energy doesn't extend to the rest of the supporting cast. Delroy Lindo and William H. Macy are both wasted, while Lambert Wilson is as insufferable here as he was in the Matrix sequels. (I suppose that's a good thing though, in a perverse way - he is the villain, after all.)

124,srobi280,"Absolutely, positively terrible",3,30 April 2006,"The plot of this movie goes something like this: A doctor searches for the source of a plague in some African countries (no, not AIDS). Matthew McConaughey with his colleagues are trying to discover some battleship in the desert (yes, a battleship in the goddamn desert). Pretty soon they fight against some dictator operating a nuclear waste disposal plant near the river Niger.Sound like a stupid plot? You bet it is! Other negative factors:Penelope Cruz's annoying Spanish accent The source of this ""plague"" is the water, and the ""plague"" is made up, even though AIDS is killing many people in Africa A battleship in the desert...The bad guys are SO stupid, and they always just happen to escape them A sickeningly happy ending OK, I'm done.. The only reason I gave this movie 3 out of 10 is because I had a BLAST making fun of it with my friends from beginning to end, resulting in non-stop laughter. So easy to make fun of. Too easy. Which is pretty much the only good thing about it.",Sahara

No, this movie is much worse... it teeters between indifference and boredom. Now, a lot has been made for Eisner directing this film. We all know who his daddy is, don't we? I think the elder Eisner cashed in all his chips and called in his favors before he has to leave Disney. Got his son a sweet little gig here. But there is nothing in this film that shows me the junior Eisner has any film-making chops. This is Hollywood at its worst, blatant nepotism. Oh, the film is professionally made to be sure. It's also spiritually empty, and a lot like cotton candy in that sense. It's pretty to look at, but not much for nourishment. I hope Cussler wins his lawsuit because SAHARA has pretty much doomed the chance we will ever see a big budget Dirk Diggler... I mean Dirk Pitt treatment with the respect it deserves.",Sahara
126,jmupton2003,Entertaining if somewhat daft,6,25 August 2005,"A sequel to Raise the Titanic this was being billed as, excuse me while I have a quick belly laugh! Adapapted from one of Clive Cussler's popular Dirk Pitt series of novels, this very much Holywoodised adaptation is glossy, well photographed and very slick.Whilst most entertainment these days can be enjoyed by leaving your brain at the door on the way in, for this, it would be wise not to bring you brain anywhere near the door in the first place as the plot leaves a lot to be desired with holes the size of battleship in it.The original plot line about the highly unlikely story (or plot device, take your pick) of the lost Civil War Ironclad battleship winding up on the wrong side of the Atlantic in the middle of a desert is seemingly forgotten for the middle two thirds of the film until an urgent requirement for something with armour plating and a convenient working cannon turns up.Whilst there are good laughs to be had and the casting of the criminally underused Willam H Macy as Admiral Sandecker is spot on, there are other problems, not the least of which is the civil war in Mali that seems to be lacking somewhat. More so as the supposed War Lord is as weak as a dishcloth and has a very small army who surrender in a split second the moment the native rebels turn up on horseback and en-masse.The biggest failing though is the woefull miscasting of Matthew McConaughey as Dirk Pitt. If Pitt is supposed to be a long experienced old sea dog then he should at least appear older, wiser and less barmy than this, more like Dirk Pitt was portrayed in the dreadful adaptation of Raise the Titanic twenty five years or more earlier.Overall, its watchable, the special effect are impressive but it is very silly. As this looks like the beginning of a franchise, I hope that they learn from the mistakes made here and consider recasting the Pitt role to someone more mature.",Sahara
127,ddelamaide,Sad adaptation,5,21 April 2005,"Clive Cussler should have stuck to his guns and not allowed another movie adaptation of his Dirk Pitt adventures. Despite spectacular photography and locations, this movie is a dud. It is miscast right down the line, starting with the hapless Matthew McConnaughey as Pitt. His attempt to capture Dirk Pitt's spirit of derring-do is lame at best. As his sidekick, Steven Zahn corresponds in no way to the descriptions in the books. Though he starts to win you over as the movie progresses, he is miscast from the beginning. The most egregious casting error is William Macy as the admiral -- he corresponds neither in age or physique or bearing to the character described in the books and his cigars are bigger than he is. What were the producers thinking? Worst of all, the script is atrocious. The four names listed are probably the tip of the iceberg -- at any rate, the script sunk this movie.",Sahara
128,simon-trek,"""If you love Cussler's Dirk Pitt novels, you would hate this movie""",1,8 April 2005,"I am a huge fan of Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt novels. Ever since I've started reading them I've recommended Cussler to everyone I know. So I was looking forward to this movie hopping it would be a much better movie adaption than 'Raise The Titanic' (the only other movie based on one of Cussler's novels). But I was sadly disappointed. I had heard that Cussler wasn't impressed with this movie but I decided to see it anyway so I could make my own judgment, and I felt foolish to have had good expectations about this movie. The cast wasn't all that bad. Matthew McConaughey was made up rather close to Dirk Pitt's description: tall, broad shouldered, black wavy hair and green eyes. I can't say Steve Zahn was that good for the role of Al Giordino. Al is meant to have dark curly hair and Italian features, while in this film he just as sandy colored hair. William H. Macy was good for the role of Admiral Sandecker but he would have looked better if his hair and beard looked more red. Rainn Wilson was good for the role of Rudi Gunn and he occasionally wear glasses in this film as he occasionally does in the novels. This movie did have a lot of action and suspense but what I hated about it is that this movie doesn't follow the story in the novel. In the novel there are two prologue chapters. One about an American Civil War ironclad ship which disappears at the end of the war. The other about a female aviator named Kitty Mannock who mysteriously disappears over the Sahara desert. While this movie only includes the prologue about the ironclad ship. In the novel Dirk Pitt wasn't searching for the ironclad, he was trying to find the source of the plague or the ""red tide"" as it is described in the novel and he never heard anything about the ship until he met a mysterious prospector in the desert who claimed he was looking for it. The evil African dictator General Kazim and the corrupt French industrialist Yves Massarde working with each other and creating the chemical waste facility in the desert which is causing the plague and threatening to destroy all life in the worlds oceans is the story in the novel as well the only problem was is that these two villains just weren't as menacing as they were in the novel. According to cast lists I've read on the internet Clive Cussler's daughter Dayna was supposed to appear in this movie as Kitty Mannock (the long lost female aviator) and she doesn't. The scene was deleted. Thought this movie does have a scene in which Dirk and Al use a crashed air plane to create a land yacht is a scene in the novel which take place in the film to, but in the novel the crashed air plane was that of Kitty Mannock who had a significant role in the novel but in this movie there is absolutely no mention of her at all. Also in the novel the ironclad ship was found to have a secret connection with the assassination of Abraham Lincoln and that isn't in the film either. So many of the main events which take place in the novel and make 'Sahara' one of Cussler's finest novels are not in this movie which make it very upsetting to Cussler fans. So once again movie makers have turned one of Cussler's great novels into a bad film. Al though the film wouldn't seem all that bad to those who like action and adventure and have never read any of Cussler's novels. But if you are a huge fan of Cussler's Dirk Pitt novels like me, this movie will truly disappoint you.",Sahara
129,spj-4,sahara,9,11 December 2005,"This was an entertaining movie in the style of an Indiana Jones production & setting. Its geographic background was intriguing & the music of Dr John in the opening credits & presentation of one of the star's research facilities was most impressive & beautifully linked to the ensuing drama! This is an action movie that had a good plot & shouldn't be missed, with good acting & scenes that drew the viewer in. At occasional times though, it became a fraction exaggerated from reality, but in particular it well presented the struggles of life of those under oppressive regimes, so it will hopefully bring the concerns & suffering & trials of such peoples into a higher international profile.

Quit trying to compare it to actual history...it doesn't present itself as history recreated like Galdiator, Titianic or King Arthur. And quit whining because it doesn't compare...they didn't say it was supposed to be REAL history. Overall, it is a fun time at a time when most of the movies in the theaters were not even within consideration for us to attend. It gave us a lot of action with decent special effects. And the characters were enjoyable and realistic, although they were underdeveloped, which seems to be the norm in Hollywood these days. They just drop someone in a say he used to...once did or met...has special knowledge...but never back any of it up with a little character development. Still, I would like to meet the good guys in this show. The seemed real and likable. Finally, I got some decent laughs as well with the liberal amount of hum-our that was sprinkle throughout the movie.",Sahara

Smart @ss Americans come to your country and blow stuff up while awful music blares!

Classic anti-hero stuff, completely glossed over.Love story, if you could call it that, was tepid and fairly unbelievable. No chemistry between Mathew and Penelope. When they finally kiss, they both seem reluctant or embarrassed.I'm amazed I sat through the whole thing.",Sahara
132,johnmichael-2,Ludicrous and lazy,3,14 September 2007,"Two words best describe this film, and I don't know which comes first: ludicrous and lazy.Let's start with ludicrous. I wasn't expecting this film to be realistic or even that great, but I wasn't prepared for it to be this over-the-top unrealistic. Vast political thrillers of this nature are hard to swallow as it is, but when it's all pushed to the side to allow an unnecessary amount of time for the merely-passable action sequences, it starts the eyes rolling. Searching for some long-lost priceless coin, coupled with an evil dictator, a deadly disease, a world-threatening water problem, and some truly unrealistic sequences (some parts in the motorboat scene and the desert boat battle were impossible for me to swallow)... Gosh, it's all too much! And it's all been done before, though not in such a silly conglomeration.Now for lazy. This movie felt like a money-making attempt from start to finish. The script was thrown together in a truly reprehensible way. Does anything come of the coin search that kick-started the plot? Nope. Is the dialogue interesting or witty or at least fun to listen to (one of these would have sufficed)? Nope. Did the story manage to be a fast-paced action-adventure instead of a sprawling mess? Nope.What about the actors? McConaughey and Cruz are talented people, but either they weren't really into this movie or Breck Eisner wasn't directing them properly or SOMETHING. Okay, so Cruz and her WHO companions were the bright spot of this film in terms of acting, but couldn't she and McConaughey at least kicked up some chemistry? I'd rather their romance be cut entirely than be sidelined in the careless way it was. It was more of an obligatory gotta-have-a-romance-in-here sort of thing. As for Steve Zahn... sorry, he sucked. Maybe he wasn't given anything to work with, or maybe (once again) he had no direction, or maybe he was just bad. I think it's a little of all three. He was one of the flattest sidekicks I've ever seen (he'd have to be, seeing as sidekicks are normally flatter than the main characters, and this movie features some of the flattest main characters in mainstream action).Hey, speaking of action... Once again, ludicrous and lazy. I couldn't swallow the cheap gimmicks in the motorboat scene or the climactic boat-in-the-desert battle or the... darn, I've forgotten most of the action! That's how unmemorable it is. After watching in disgusted disbelief as a 150-year-old ship cannon blows up a helicopter, the rest of the mediocre action melts away with the rest of the movie.Direction: lazy, bad. Music: I can hardly remember it, which for me means it's bad. If it was good music, I'd remember it and I'd probably sit through the film again to listen to it. Special effects: okay, some of them were pretty cool, which is probably the only reason I'm not giving this movie a 1-star. Of course, the special effects couldn't redeem the bad storyline, the lazy actors, the unskilled director, and the shoddy unification of the whole piece.Bottomline: 4/10. If you watch nothing but action movies, you're eventually going to have to wind down to this one. So go ahead and watch it, but I warn you that it's bad. You're better off rewatching ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" for the millionth time. Oh, and go ahead and watch it if you hate realistic movies with good acting and a good storyline. But there's so many better movies to choose from, so I'd recommend to the vast majority of moviegoers just to skip this movie.",Sahara
133,spencejoshua-22736,Not my cup of tea.,4,13 August 2020,"I was hoping for something different because there's some great actors in this film: Lennie James, William J. Macy, Matthew McConaughey, Rainn Wilson, Penelope Cruz, Steve Zahn. They actually did a good job in their respected roles..... unfortunately the characters that they were portraying had very little depth.This is an action comedy flick that is centered around treasure hunters. As many others have pointed out, it would fit nicely amongst the Indiana Jones franchise.
There's some impressive action scenes here and there, but if you're looking for even an ounce of realism.....go elsewhere. There's stuff that happened in The Lord of the Rings that is more believable.This film is too long and too coincidental for my flavor.",Sahara

There is absolutely nothing original or good going on here.The movie tries to match the Indiana Jones formula of high adventure crossed with a little humor. However, it falls short on so many levels. The acting and writing are awful, leading to little or no chemistry amongst the lead characters. I could actually predict what line was coming next or where a scene was going well in advance. Although I believe there was a decent-sized budget, the overall feel is of a cheap, 1980's action movie. The editing in particular feels very amateurish and rushed in many early scenes.So many bad memories from this one: The predictable boat chase, the boring fist fight on top of a tower, the supposedly ""romantic"" moments with McConaughey and Cruz, the laughable final sequence in the Civil War ironclad battleship, William H. Macy generally looking like he's not sure how he got mixed up in this awful film... It goes on and on.How about the terrible soundtrack too? It mixes very annoying classic rock (Sweet Home Alabama anyone?) with some pseudo African/Middle Eastern music. Also, at the height of the action scenes, it sometimes wants to sound a bit like Indiana Jones meets James Bond. A confused effort, to say the least.I'd say avoid this one at all costs. Very predictable, bland stuff.",Sahara
135,serafinogm,A fun romp that starts with a bang!,9,9 October 2015,"The opening Civil War battle scene alone is worth the price of admission. Then you sprinkle the movie with the irrepressible Matthew McConaughey, the smoldering and incredibly sexy Penélope Cruz, and the always entertaining Steve Zahn and you've the makings of something that could turn out quite well. Add an exciting and fun screenplay and you've got yourself a winner. I enjoyed this film immensely and have over the years put the CD (now Blu-ray disc) into the ole player sat back and had a bit of relaxed fun and even after the first and second watch excitement as well. This film is highly underrated and I hope with CD and Blu-ray sales it made some money because it simply deserved it. I wonder why the production budget was so high and am quite interested in trying to glean that bit of a puzzle out when the time presents itself. I loved the film and I think you might as well! I just performed some cursory research on why it cost over 200 million to produce and distribute Sahara. Here are just two I found and for the most part are just a cut and paste:1) About 1,000 cast and crew members worked on ""Sahara."" The highest- paid was McConaughey, who received an $8-million fee, or $615,385 for each week of filming, not including bonuses and other compensation. Lovely Penelope Cruz earned $1.6 million (deserved every penny of it). Whereas Rainn Wilson, who since has raised his profile through roles in ""Six Feet Under"" and ""The Office,"" was paid $45,000 for 10 weeks of work.2) Ten screenwriters were paid almost $4 million in fees and bonuses — highlighting the increasingly common practice of hiring and firing numerous writers on big-budget features.Clearly these two items were not the cause for 160 million in production costs (and we're not even counting distribution costs, about another 90 million) so what did happen? It's almost like the organized crime produced this movie! I refuse to give a 10 to a movie that produced a huge loss for no apparent reason!",Sahara
136,Eaglegrafix,Sahara - Exciting Action and Lots of Fun,8,8 May 2005,"Sahara is an above average adaptation for Clive Cussler's high adventure book. It is a better movie for those who have not read Cussler than those that follow Dirk Pitt and his group from NUMA. Like the hero in the books, Dirk Pitt preforms some fairly fantastic feats many with satisfying payoffs. It is a good summer movie that the family can enjoy although it has mild violence, it is not gratuitous. An action packed movie that has clean language may be the strongest reason to consider the movie. Casting was the major disappointment, especially for a Dirk Pitt fan. Matthew McConaughey as Dirk Pitt has charm, humor and is pleasant to look but does not bring to mind a seasoned adventurer. Steve Zahn and William H. Macy as Al Goridino and Admiral Sandecker also are not a good fit for a Pitt fan. They give good performances but are another reason the movie will be better for those who have never read the books. No complaints whatsoever about the casting of Penélope Cruz as Dr. Rojas. Her part as a doctor is more essential than as a beautiful woman in the movie and she does both very well. I gave it an 8 - more than good enough for a fun night at the movies.",Sahara
137,katiepoppycat,boys adventure,10,8 April 2005,"I've been a Dirk Pitt fan for a long long time, he's been my hero ever since my dad gave me Shockwave to read when I was 10. Since then, I've eagerly anticipated every new book release, and Clive has never disappointed, delivering action, adventure, fun and teeny little bit of history in every book. And Breck Eisner does exactly the same. I've been following the progress of the film as eagerly as any other Dirk junkie, wailing with disappointment when Hugh Jackman cancelled, and being hideously disappointed with the casting of Steve Zahn. And last night I went to see the film and absolutely loved it. It's not 'spot on' in the way that PJ managed to film the version of LOTR that every geeky fan-boy has been playing in their heads for years. But I really really enjoyed it. Matthew McConaughey was totally believable as Dirk, Steve Zahn was a great Al, even if he wasn't the Al from the book; and they played off against each other beautifully. Their low key wrangling and the hints of their past really fulfilled all my expectations. Penelope Cruz was a little 2D as Eva, but most of Dirk's female romantic interests are rather 2D, even if they are beautiful intelligent doctors/diplomats/marine biologists. But she at least had a go at taking care of herself and didn't spend the whole film waiting to be rescued. William H Macy was great as Sandecker, even if he didn't have quite the right look. His telephone call during the shootout on the Calliope was inspired. The only disappointment was Rudi Gunn - he was great in the film but not the capable cool right hand man he is in the book. I don't think any Clive Cussler fan need feel betrayed by this film - It translates most of the action of the book onto the screen and remains true to it's spirit. I went to see this with one other fan and two people who had never read the books and we all loved it. And BTW when did they ever say they were Navy SEALs in the movie?",Sahara
138,giomanombre,Basic boring action movie.,3,25 September 2005,"This movie is certainly not cult classic material. The introduction to rising action plot leading to the action was like a chore to watch through. The sequences were quite implausible, where the good guys just survive each scene and come out unscathed. When you already know in advance that every 'good person' in the action scenes in the film comes out OK, then you already know part of the ending of how the plot is going to unfold. Do not think there was a resolution to the toxic spill, or elements of plot to feel connected with, or seem worried of the fate of the 'good people'.I'm fortunate enough to have rented this movie for free because of a Guaranteed Stock item at a time all the DVD's were out. I cant imagine why the demand for these DVDs were for such an extent, perhaps, action films are not my favorite genre. Playing a good video game would be more fun than watching a movie like this.On a positive note there was virtually no swearing or profanity or bad scenes. There is enough originality on the movie to keep the viewer's curiosity, (I would say rather than suspense) to see the movie to its end.

There are some decent action scenes and it has Penélope Cruz in a bikini. But, if you are a fan of Cussler’s books or have even just read the one this movie is based on then you will find this movie is a waste of 2 hours of your time. Beyond the names of the movie and the characters the movie bears little resemblance to the book. The book (hardcover) is 65 chapters essentially about how the unsafe storage of toxic materials is killing people, polluting the ocean and threatening to kill off all life on earth. Of that barely two chapters (the shortest in the book) that even mention the Texas and of that only two or three sentences even mention treasure, yet that is what Mr. Donnelly chose to focus his screenplay on while virtually ignoring the main story.I must applaud the actors for their efforts though.

How hard is it to look at a map and see that Monterrey is nowhere near a coast.Next. I'm not a fan of Penelope Cruz anyway. Put her in the role of an annoying bleeding heart liberal WHO doctor, and you have a recipe for boredom.It also takes too long for one to care even a little for the other characters.The story seems choppy.

141,dmc102,More adventure than even NUMA could handle!,9,11 April 2005,"Grand master of adventure Clive Cussler finally has one of his Dirk Pitt novels placed on the big screen properly and doubtless to say, Sahara is a roaring success. Taken in the vein of classic films such as Indiana Jones, and to a lesser extent Romancing the Stone and Alain Quatermain, adventurer Dirk Pitt and his likable companion Al Giordino trek into Saharan Africa on the trail of a civil war artifact and two health officials. Obviously, nothing quite goes to plan and Dirk must enlist the help of various locals to help him on his way.The casting of Sahara would never have pleased everyone, in die-hard Cussler circles the debate over the casting of Pitt and Giordino has raged ever since the release of ""Raise the Titanic"" when television player Richard Jordan took up the diving mask. In my personal opinion, both Matthew McConaughey and Steve Zahn pull off the rolls superbly. Also, William H. Macy is perfect as Admiral Sandecker.This movie will not change your life, and neither will it try to. Intelectuals may want to stay at home and read an issue of Statistical Science because you won't find a meaningful, complicated and artistic film here. This is not a film, it is a movie. I great popcorn munching, entertaining movie and as long as you don't overestimate it, you won't be disappointed.Forget your opinions of Breck Eisner because of his wealthy father, none of us choose our parents and it may just occur to you that he may have got the job because he is, well, a good director. Clive Cussler fans (like me) should enjoy this as long as they remember that this is not one of Cussler's masterpiece novels and it is extremely hard to transfer novels such as his onto film.Keep and open mind as you stroll into the cinema and remember that you are about to experience a good old fashioned adventure story and not Citizen Kane.

It is also exceptional since the adventure is so good, it does not need to rely on bad language or anything cheap to keep attention. It does extremely well with the story line and acting themselves.The story line does come from Clive Cussler's book ""Sahara"" which I had read previously. The book was a great adventure yarn. The movie keeps somewhat close to the book, at least touching its main points, and also capturing the adventure fun.If you liked Indiana Jones, or similar adventure films in the past, you might also like this one.

None of that is present in the horrible movie.Casting: Matthew McConaughey has the body but that's all he has. Dirk Pitt is an old-school adventurer, kinda like Humphrey Bogart. Matthew McConaughey turns the character into some kind of x-gamer wild child, complete with the leather neck lace and the oh-so-cute 7 days beard.Pelope Cruz is simply laughable... Was she ever any good? well, it does not show in this flick. Her accent seem completely out of place. I have only one word: DIALECT COACH. The rest is the cast is so-so.William H. Macy is a caricature of admiral Sandecker. In a recent interview, Macy said he would take commercial roles just for the money -well this is one.Lambert Wilson ads one more title on his list of self-parodies... He sounds like the Merovingian who just got a job working for Union Carbide. Theeee frenche accentee soundes just a little bitte like inspectore Clouseau...Direction: Bad, bad times 50... For a rare occasion, it is obvious that the director didn't direct any of the acting. The music track is also horribly distracting.Story: I know that Cussler's stories can sometimes be over the top but i'm sure he never wrote anything close to this moronic predictable stinker. One last point for the director: French speaking people speak french between themselves. They surely not speak highly accented English... Also, tanks do NOT surrender to men on horses, even if they have a few RPGs...Plot holes: Why did the ship end up there?? Why the crew die?? I'll stop listing the plot holes... let's say that this movie asks for more than suspension of disbelief... It MAJOR levitation that's required.Finally, this movie is borderline condescending.

144,dien,3 films in 1 ... and they all suck,3,17 August 2012,"I had recently seen another McConaughey's flick called 'Fool's Gold' and said to myself - isn't there another adventure film with him? And sure there was one, Sahara. I was actually looking forward to a funny action packed adventure in style of Indiana Jones, just with more laughs and fights. Boy was I let down.First of all, this is not just one film. No, it's three films in one (I don't care if it had been rewritten or what had happened to the original script, the result was horrible).The first story is about a search for a lost ship, CSS Texas, that somehow ended in Sahara. Here we have the classic tale - no one believes McConaughey's theories, but in the end they prove to be correct. This should have been the only main story of the film. Instead, we get two more.The second story deals with an epidemic spreading from Mali to neighbouring countries. Penelope Cruz is the scientist trying to locate the source and ends up fighting some evil Germans in order to prevent an eco disaster. Again, this would have been an interesting storyline ... in a separate movie! The last story (and by far the worst) is the battle against some African dictator. There was absolutely no reason for this storyline to be included in the film, but hey, it takes place in Sahara, so why not throw in some nut-case general? Most of the second act consist of this.In the end all three story lines come together in an end that is so ridiculous, that you simply don't care anymore. At least I didn't. And I was waiting for the film to end.I have heard somewhere that Sahara was supposed to be the first film in the Dirk Pitt series of adventures similar to Indiana Jones, but because of the poor reception the idea has been abandoned. No wonder.",Sahara
145,newfiesailor,Shouldn't be Compared to Indiana Jones.,6,23 May 2006,"This movie is mildly entertaining at best, whereas Raider's of the Lost Ark rewrote action adventure in the eighties. There is a blandness to the film, which is tough to accomplish given the amount of charismatic stars in it and the marvelous setting. The cast seems to be just going through the motions, the script way too cliché. It is more in the vein of the Mummy than the Indiana Jones series.With a name like Dirk Pitt, then I guess I should have expected cliché. But there is some real potential action adventure stuff here: a salvage crew globe trotting the world, a charismatic star and a hilarious sidekick, a beautiful woman, a plague and a bloodthirsty African warlord. Matthew McConaughey, William H Macy and Steve Zahn. How does it manage to fall flat? The characters are undeveloped. Matthew McConaughey can breathe real life into a role when given the chance. Watch Frailty, A Time to Kill and Reign of Fire. Steve Zahn can be deadly hilarious as he was in Saving Silverman. William H Macy's resume speaks for itself. Why not give them room to breathe instead of forcing them from one action scene to the next so they don't develop. Poor direction. The script is so juvenile a twelve year old could have wrote it. I almost felt embarrassed for Mr. Macy in the phone sequence while Dirk and Al pull the ""Panama"" on his boat. There is no way an actor of his caliber should be given lines like that.And so this becomes another Hollywood vehicle with star power to draw in crowds and con us into paying good money for crap. It's too bad because this could have been a series in the style of Mr. Bond if it had been handled correctly. Instead it becomes one of those DVD's with a dusty cover destined to sit on rental shelves everywhere across North America, quickly forgotten.",Sahara
146,hakapes,Funny action,8,19 June 2005,"This was really funny action movie with average actors, average plot, average everything, but it's perfect for a hot summer afternoon in a well air-conditioned cinema. The story is about the seek for a lost ship full of gold, about a doctor unwillingly part of the crew, some romance and of course saving the world from the great disaster. I loved the fast paced action, the landscapes in the desert, the silly jokes of the supporting cast. Penelope Cruz is as beautiful as always and they make perfect fun partners with Matthew McConaughey (Dark Pitt). Of course in the end you get the big happy scene with all the money and the big kiss, which I expected a lot and was so happy for. This is a typical watch it and forget it piece, but great for that 8/10.",Sahara
147,ChrisinDesMoines,I don't get the unpopularity,8,10 September 2020,"I've come to the conclusion that this is one of those movies that you either love or you hate, and I'm one of the ""love it"" guys.In some ways you can compare it to your typical James Bond movie, the girl everyone wants and the guy that everyone wants to be like, but if it's cut from the same bolt of cloth, Dirk Pitt (McConaughey) is fraying at the edges. I've tried reading some of Clive Cussler's books, but not exactly my style, but both movies based on his material (Sahara and Raise the Titanic) are decent enough movies with this one being the better of the two (and apart from the news article regarding the Titanic during the opening credits you wouldn't know it was connected). Dirk Pitt is portrayed wildly different in both movies with this one being more action and humor oriented.Movie is easy enough to find and watch for free on streaming services so if you have a Roku just do a search for it. If it isn't available when you do search for it, sit tight, it will make another round of availability soon enough. Definitely worth it if you're looking for an action/adventure style buddy movie with humor.",Sahara
148,ricklb-43546,This had such potential.,2,20 June 2020,"It started with an adventure, the plot turned into a quest... then is railroaded by ""Nobody cares about Africa"" unlined story with weird story lines, about waste disposal, self destruct boat and building (James Bond type). Random cave paintings. A helicopter that chases them all over the desert passing them hundreds of times in pursuit...(it's a helicopter. Meaning it can hover, and not have to do fly byes.) The doctor played by Penelope acts in no way like a doctor would with an outbreak epidemic possibility in the works. But she does shoot AK-47 full auto. Throw dynamite from a moving car, driving through a bumpy desert with no roads. Far fetched I can live with, but why would a millionaire African warlord have to be the one in the co-pilot seat flying all over the Sahara to chase down these good guys? ""we can't fight them they have tanks""... In less the bad guys climb out of their dozen tanks for no apparent reason. Ask yourself this one simply question movie goers.. If the wells and rivers are poisoned with this deadly highly infectious water. Then what in the world are the good guys drinking this whole time whilst traversing the SAHARA?

149,AEBarschall,McConaughey is gorgeous,6,21 April 2005,"A guy once told me that you can tell a guy flick, because there has to be at least one explosion, which is very Freudian if you think about it. This one has MANY explosions. Moreover, except for Cruz, there are no female characters, other than extras -- definitely a guy flick.The plot is a bit hokey, especially the science fictiony parts. That doesn't prevent it from being a fun movie, though. There are lots of great shots of McConaughey's perfectly sculptured body; and of course of Cruz's as well.McConaughey plays a typical Hollywood action hero. He regularly overwhelms large groups of armed men alone with his bare hands, or with just one other guy. He has no trouble outfighting guys bigger than he is. Hundreds of bad guys armed with machine guns can spray bullets in his vicinity, but he won't get hurt. On the other hand, if he fires a pistol a few times, all the bad guys die. He wanders on and on in the Sahara and doesn't seem to get thirsty, etc.One troubling thing is that all the guys McConaughey hits are black. Now the movie is quick to be politically correct. There are good and bad black guys. There are good and bad white guys. Still there is the implication that only a white guy can go save the damsel in distress, and the depiction of what Africans are like is not too uplifting.This movie is also incredibly violent.The theatre wasn't very full, perhaps because it was a week night. When I got out, one of few other audience members, another woman, remarked to me ""Penelope Cruz could have whatever man she wanted and she sure knew what she was doing."" I smiled broadly. Yes, obviously perfect looks are important to her.I think Cruz does a very good job of acting, by the way. I find her very believable, in addition to being stunning. Can't necessarily say the same for some of the guys.All-in-all, though, it was a fun watch, not very high brow, but fun.",Sahara

This should have been animated and put on Saturday morning for the kids.It starts out really well.

151,the-jerk,A major disappointment for fans,7,16 May 2005,"A couple decades ago, a movie came out called ""Raise the Titanic"". It was based on the book of the same name by Clive Cussler, part of his popular and immensely entertaining series of Dirk Pitt novels. The movie was awful, it didn't have any of the charm of the books, and it bombed. Cussler said he would never allow another one of his books to be made into a movie, and for a while, he kept to that.Fast-forward to 2005. For the first time since ""Raise the Titanic"", a new Clive Cussler movie has come out. This one is based on ""Sahara"", a good choice because it's certainly one of his best books and lends itself well to movie adaptation. But Cussler didn't like how the movie turned out; he disowned it as something he had a hand in creating and sued the studio. And having seen the movie, I can understand why.The fact is, ""Sahara"" is only an adaptation in the most basic sense of the word. The basic plot is there (about the search for the source of a dangerous bacterial algae intertwined with the search for an old civil war ironclad), the basic characters are there, but that's about it. Once again, much of the charm of the original book (and the Dirk Pitt books in general) has been wiped out.I know how unfair it is to rate a movie based on how well it clings to the original material, and the fact is, if you like dumb action-adventure movies, you'll probably like this. But so much of the appeal of the books is missing. We only see four major characters (Dirk Pitt, Al Giordino, Admiral Sandecker, and Rudi Gunn) from the series. In the books, there are many supporting characters, and part of the appeal of the books is coming across these characters in book after book. Where's Hiram Yaeger and Max, for Christ's sake? And Loren Smith doesn't even get mentioned? Another problem is the casting choices. Steve Zahn is an awful choice for Al, and I think anybody who's read the books would tell you that. And Rainn Wilson is similarly miscast as Rudi. It's not that big a problem in Rudi's case (it's a relatively small part), but in Al's case it's almost inexcusable. Al Giordino's a big,tough guy, and it's an important part of his character. Steve Zahn is a wimp who's not even known for his action parts. Matthew McConaughey is okay as Pitt, but not great... he seems to understand the character at least, but he doesn't seem like a great match. Only William H. Macy, in my opinion, really seems right for his role. He's perfect as Sandecker, but then again, he's the best actor in the movie.And then there's the historical background. In the book, the ironclad that Pitt is searching for carried Abraham Lincoln across the ocean. Why isn't he even mentioned in the movie? The same thing goes for the plane they end up sailing across the desert on... in the book, there was a great back story for that about an aviator who was lost a la Amelia Earhart, but in the movie, no mention is made of the plane even being a significant archaeological find. Historical background is a trademark of Cussler's and one of the things that makes his books so appealing. Why is there barely a mention here? As to the supporting characters who aren't regularly repeating characters in the books, I did think Penelope Cruz did an outstanding job as Eva Rojas, and Massarde and Kazim were well-cast. Cruz, in fact, gives the most entertaining performance. But so much was changed (the houseboat would have looked so good on film; why wasn't it in the movie?) that I had trouble with them too. Massarde gets a PG ending for the movie; what really happened to him in the book was so cool, but I guess the movie's creators thought it was too shocking for a family adventure movie. Of course, this is only one of many questionable changes made to the story. Even worse, we don't get much in the way of real background for Pitt and Giordino, and no mention is made of Pitt's classic car collection (another big draw for the books) or the hangar that he lives in. This would have been awesome to have seen.I understand that you have to change some aspects of a book when you make it into a movie, for the sake of structure, as well as the simple fact that not everything will fit. And I do understand the impetus to make almost all of the action take place in Africa, thus eliminating the chance of seeing some of the stuff that was left out. But I also think you have to give some consideration to the fans, and I think the filmmakers dropped the ball here. This is a pathetic adaptation by any standard.So what's good about it? The back-and-forth between Pitt and Giordino is spot-on, I think, and the cinematography is perfect, capturing exactly the right look for the book. And the action sequences are spectacular, and worth the price of admission. I also liked the soundtrack. But for a real fan, I don't think the pluses outweigh the minuses, and I have to think you'll only really love it if you've never picked up a Dirk Pitt book before. If you've read ""Sahara"", you're going to be disappointed in the movie. But as a silly action movie, it's actually pretty good, and compares favorably to the average movie of the genre (although it doesn't really stand out). So I give the movie, on its own merits, a rating of 7 out of 10. Shave off a couple of points if you're already a fan of Cussler.",Sahara

153,sidunrau,"Very Fun, though Implausible",8,9 April 2005,"This was a fun movie. One of my favorite film critics really trashed it so I had low expectations. This movie has action, slight romance, adventure, and a pair of lovable lead characters.The eccentricities of the main characters provided most of the entertainment for me, including the female lead. Each had a different agenda, different talents, and distinct flavors to add to the mix. I loved how all those elements blended together in the context of the underlying story.There are two story lines - both of which are hinted at in the trailers. One is a mysterious hidden plant in the desert; the other is the main character's obsession with finding a lost Conferate iron-clad ship - also in the middle of the desert. With the ""desert"" connection, the story unfolded in a very satisfying way.Yes, the whole thing is implausible (no way a Civil War ship could cross an ocean, get up a river and end up under all that sand - especially without anyone noticing; also, no way the ""danger"" was so absolute and universal - well, I guess that's the way many Hollywood flicks put things - the characters have to save the world).

Sexy Guy!,6,12 April 2005,"In the fashion of Raider's of the Lost Ark and Romancing the Stone, Sahara follows the adventures of Dirk Pitt (Matthew McConaughey) a Master Explorer who is in search of Jefferson Davis's gold coins he believes are in Africa. The story is complicated by corrupt African tribal leaders, greedy European businessmen, and a mysterious disease that threatens to kill everyone in its path.Along for the ride are Steve Zahn, Penelope Cruz, William H. Macy, Delroy Lindo and Glynn Turman who we haven't seen on the acting front in quite a while.Chemistry! Chemistry! Chemistry! I can't stand it when the guy and the girl don't look right together! Cruz's bird like appearance paid no compliments to McConaughey's rugged good looks and exquisite physique (whew!). However, Zahn and McConaughey's chemistry was great! They were adventurous and funny.What I liked best about the movie was the strong African-American/African presence in the supporting roles. Obviously, a movie set in Africa would have a large African cast. Ha! But a lot of the good roles in this movie were played by actors of color. See for yourself, I think you'll be pleased.Sahara and the Dirk Pitt character were based on a series of novels written by Clive Cussell and is primed for a sequel.

155,Montaya_111,Good Movie Bad Matthew McConaughey,7,16 April 2005,"Matthew McConaughey, you have got to be kidding. He is a pretty boy not an action hero, he doesn't have the ruggedness for Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt. I have been a fan of the books for years and when I watched the movie and Matthew Try to pull off Dirk Pitt I was sorely Disappointed. However, Steve Zahn was a great Al Giordino he has the same humorous disposition as the books they couldn't have chosen someone better. As for Penelope Cruz she wasn't bad as Eva Rojas. Overall the movie was excellent but you see Matthew out there trying to play the good rugged good guy and he's just been in so many girly romance movies that he can't do it. The action scenes were very good very original, the beautiful car the Avions Voision was a nice touch. They missed a good chunk of the book but I guess that is too be expected you can't turn a 550 plus page book into a good movie. But shrinked and compressed a little and the movie was excellent. Admiral James Sandecker played by William H. Macy was a good choice, he is intelligent and witty and fits the bill perfectly.

McConaughey, in the lead (Dirk Pitt/hero role) was a fine choice, even though with artistic licence, he is younger than Richard Jordan as Character in Raise The Titanic, another Cussler epic! The rest of the cast was somewhat disappointing! Casting Execs, were far too overindulgent, with the choice for the love interest. It would have gone better, to a struggling unknown! The plot was good but in all fairness, it did start to wander with the toxicology problem of the area, where the waste dumping was occurring. The baddies in the film came over as idiots, I get more frightened from my 11 year old in a grumpy mood. The story of the missing Ironclad was riveting (No pun intended).

157,cujo2,Oldfasioned adventure flick,7,6 June 2005,"I have been a passionate pulp reader for as long as I can remember. The books of Clive Cussler are nothing more or less then good old fashioned pulp. Featuring heroes with beards at least a day old it is an old spice commercial all over again. Clear cut plots and straightforward action that moves from a to b.However I never really liked the Clive Cussler books, somehow they seem dated and in my opinion not that well written. The main character Dirk Pit never comes really alive on the pages and the whole boldly man adventures are actually rather boring. This was also the mindset I started with when watching this movie, and after the end credits rolled over the screen I was pleasantly surprised. Of course it is simple entertainment but everyone involved knows it and secretly doesn't take it that serious. The locations are very very nice and the action scenes -starting late in the movie- are original and well done. It is obvious the makers opted for a franchise and raised the budget to give the series a good start. Everything looks expensive.It is still an old fashioned adventure based on dated books but if you have to make a movie with that kind of a source do it like this. One of the few irritating moments in the film are provided when Mrs Cruz is walking through the screen. Her English is very bad to a level that the Africans in the film speak better English then she does. She also looks misplaced and uncomfortable in her part delivering her side kick performance with no magic at all. Spoilers ahead!If you watch this step gently over the plot holes that feature a plague which origins are unknown. This leads to funny scenes where Mrs Cruz wears gloves in one scene and none in the other and takes precautions in dealing with patients that varies per village she visits. I could imagine being a bit more careful when having to deal with a deadly plague to put it mildly. On the other hand we have a treasure ship that winds up in Africa coming from the US (??) and in the climax of the film Dirk Pit becomes psychic because he can pinpoints the ship exactly. Not to mention a scene that seems to be stolen out of a road runner cartoon where Dirk fires a 150 year old canon to shoot a helicopter.It all sounds rather crappy but besides the Cruz factor everything works out nicely.If there comes a sequel it would be advisable to trade in the ""funny sidekick"" to ban Mrs Cruz and to find someone with more screen presence and charisma to play Dirk Pit.Recommendable for old fashioned adventure goers.",Sahara
158,FilmSchoolWriter,"A lacking, but still enjoyable, flick",5,8 January 2006,"""Sahara"" is an enjoyable movie. Granted, it definitely won't turn into a surprise Golden Globe/SAG/Oscar winner, or even a nominee. It's only OKAY, but it doesn't really try to be anything better than that.The pyrotechnics (though often used) are nothing spectacular and in the beginning, they're flat out cheesy. But as the movie progresses, so does the quality of the effects; climaxing in the old west-meets-James Bond showdown at the end.There's nothing excessively original about ""Sahara"" and there are many moments when you think to yourself, ""My God that looks really familiar!"" Then later on you realize, ""Oh yeah! That was in James Bond/'Pirates of the Caribbean'/'National Treasure'!"" And there are lots of parts of the plot that appear to be direct take offs of ""Pirates of the Caribbean"". The most noticeable being the music which is very ""Pirates-esq"", and the gold coin Dirk keeps obsessively tossing around for no apparent reason. (And for those who watch this on DVD, the main menu is a direct take off of the main menu from ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" - minus the pirates obviously) That's not to say that there aren't the original and really entertaining pieces of ""Sahara"". The dialog is quick, fairly original, witty and sufficiently amusing. It keeps you engaged and gives you a few chuckles, but nothing really makes you fall out of your seat laughing. The plot is good, but lacks in some, intangible ways that make it slow, but not so slow that you feel like getting up and leaving in the middle. It's fairly predictable but still contains a decent amount of surprising moments. The two plots of the epidemic and Dirk's obsession mesh pretty well, and although it's obvious that there will be some sort of romance between Eva and Dirk, it isn't built up very well.""Sahara"" is good and pretty decent fun if you want to watch a light movie that tries to be deep. I give it a 5.5/10.",Sahara

But they hit everything they fire at........Spoilers Below......even with a 150 year-old cannon. OK, the toxic waste is a few days from reaching the ocean and causing global catastrophe. Apparently once the bad guys are dead the danger disappears. The river is clean, people are no long being poisoned and the toxins are cleaned up. And the doctor has a treatment for severe toxic waste poisoning. Yeah, right. Finding a Civil War ironclad in the desert was more of an anti-climax than the fulfillment of a lifelong quest. The scene of the ironclad escaping Union canon fire was well done but there was no explanation of the crew's mission rather than to escape with gold. Of all the places they might have sailed, why Africa and up the Niger River? In the book the crew had kidnapped Abraham Lincoln and our heroes found his remains in the ship. Not here.

Why questionable? How long would anyone go the far they are given to appear, before finding the high speed means they improvised to surf their way to sanctuary a trade for vehicular help to the next part of the journey, or was the audience meant to overlook the affects of arid desert not dictating need of water? No mention was made of the ""Sun's anvil"" affect from ""Lawrence of Arabia"" fame one is supposed to ""desert cook"" in record time, but still how long our characters go without thirst? Otherwise, the story was quite adventurous/humorous in keeping with an ""Indian Jones"" style of scene melding. Personally, I look toward the potential of sequel to enigmatic questions hoped the producers see fit to strive another story. Just don't under estimate climate conditions next time. Even Dr. Jones ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" left an enigma to date, how he smuggled self for the lengthy submarine ride to island the time lapse shot inferred.Yes, our lead character has shown the side of acting beyond a theologian shown in the late Carl Sagan's ""Contact"" much glad to see he's not being type cast, by virtue of our fast thinking heroin of close call dilemmas.

163,thiu,entertaining enough...,6,19 April 2005,"i was expecting it to be a bad action movie. When i did see this movie, i found that it was not a great movie but it was entertaining. a second rate action movie. it was entertaining enough with classic jokes made by the sidekick (Steve Zahn) and the hero (Matthew) being this all-American guy that always solves the problem. And throw in a sexy leading lady in Penelope Cruz. First of all the plot was just okay. It's hard to believe that they actually found the ship's location just based on a drawing on the cave. The connection between the diseases and the treasure was also sort of a stretch because of an underground water system. Hmm.... i don't know, that piece of the puzzle seems forced and does not fit that closely. Fortunately though the script does not emphasize any intellectuality. It doesn't provide solid proof to believe in this wild goose chase. It emphasizes more the adventure and the fun that you get when you do something exciting. The view and scenery of this film is amazing! action sequences are also pretty good. Now on to the actors. It was an okay cast. Matthew was believable as this sort of weirdo that is obsessed with this treasure. Then there's steve, the sidekick, actually for the first time a sidekick actually did some of the rescuing instead of just providing laughs. He was good and quirky. Oh and Matthew and Steve here are like invincible, they fight, stop bombs and do incredible stunts. the script says that they were SEALS, i guess that explains it all. Penelope on the other hand was sort of an awkward mix. First of all do you expect someone with that kind of aerobicized body to be in WHO. And how much money does she earn anyway? She had this great gown at the beginning of the film. One of the biggest problems however was Penelope's accent. She seems more conscious of her lines that actually acting. All in all though it's a feel good movie. It sort of reminded me of National treasure only a bit better.",Sahara
164,MyContribution,Fabulously Fun Adventure,9,11 September 2020,"Sahara is pure entertainment. It recalls such classic comedic action movies as Raiders of the Lost Ark and Romancing the Stone. The movie comprises two compelling storylines: a treasure hunt steeped in folklore and a quest to save the world from a plague. The action scenes that result are fabulously fun. The characters interact well and the dialogue is natural and often witty. The movie occasionally has a laugh at itself with character comments like 'there was no way that should have worked'. But it does, and it is an adventure well shared. Definitely worth watching.",Sahara
165,kaipi-1,You should be ashamed of yourself,1,5 March 2008,"I've been reading Clive Cussler's books since the fifth grade, Sahara was the first of his books that I read, it's my favorite and the book that really made the push into me starting my own book series, so naturally, when I heard that it was going to be made into a movie I couldn't wait to see it. We really need zeros to rate movies, because if we did I... well, I'd probably still complain that we needed negative numbers. I didn't get to see the movie in theaters but I picked it up the day it came out on DVD then I hid it under my bed, ashamed that I wasted my money. This is just... this is the kind of movie that will have any Clive Cussler fan having to erase several times because it's just too hard not to include a swear or two, or twelve-kindred and two. This movie is basically a lesson for all authors, keep your movie rights and sit on them so at least you won't have to see your work ruined in your lifetime.So, let's look at how these people took probably the best Dirk Pitt novel, and turned it into the pile of um, cow defecation that it was the Ironclad has almost nothing to do with the original story, it was essentially a different story in the book. They took out the awesome mutant tribal people who ate a bunch of snotty rich British tourists. They made the red tide less significant. They made Rudi Gunn a wimp instead of an Ex-Navy commander. They took out the UN strike force. They did away with the gold mine at Tebezza, and the French fort. They made the aircraft that they found less significant. They took out the awesome battle on the river and replaced it with a flare gun. Last,they changed the way they killed General Kazim. Worse still they replaced the book cover after the movie. They also didn't stick to the deal with Cussler; again back to the sitting on the movie rights. Being an author myself I can say this.

It had some James Bondian sound bytes, a dash of Indiana Jones, some Armageddon and a little screwball comedy thrown in for good measure. I thought the underlying story line was sort of thin.., and the heroes were a little too tree huggish. There are also those movies that can really pull off the improbable, but this one fell a bit short. Overall, while there were some entertaining moments, it seemed like the script was created by Studio Management with marketing survey in hand, assisted by a random plot generator designed to maximize the audience that this would appeal to. Unfortunately, all this was at the expense of the quality of the movie. It could have been a REALLY good page-turner, but fell short to the OK category. Hollywood big guys..are you listening?

168,marcusedenellis,Fun but incoherent plot...,5,9 April 2005,"Sahara is based on a book by Clive Cussler of whom I know very little, although based on comments and posting that I have read here - he clearly has a legion of fans. I have read a couple of Dirk Pitt novels but I do not remember them that well other than the fact that in one of the books, Cussler put himself in the plot in a small role. Whether this was to lend some kind of reality to the story or if it was out of some sort of vanity - I don't know.What I can tell you about the film is that if you approach it from the popcorn munching, brainless level that we all have to assume from time to time, then it occasionally delivers with some nice set pieces. Forget the bitching about the leads not exactly matching their respective descriptions from the book. That is pretty much irrelevant.Matthew McConaughey delivers a nicely judged performance in the role of Dirk Pitt. He performs the heroics solidly enough; looks reasonably buff and has a nice sardonic edge to his character. It's a pretty standard action-hero role. Al (Dirk's buddy cum sidekick) is played by Steve Zahn and this too is a nice turn, with all the dorky charm required of a good sidekick, but also handy in a sticky situation and not a clueless oaf - which can be so irritating. Penelope Cruz is a cardboard cutout as a feisty doctor and lacks any real chemistry with McConaughey but they got in on in real life so maybe there was something I didn't spot. I loved William H. Macey but he is always so damn watchable in everything he does that we should expect nothing else.However, that aside, the action is poorly paced and not quite on the mark as it seems to sit awkwardly with the main plot - which is where the whole thing comes gloriously undone.There really appears to be no real narrative cohesion. The script appears to bash several interesting plot lines together with no apparent connectivity. For instance, part of the plot revolves around an ironclad ship that escaped a blockade during the American civil war, loaded with gold, and then crossed the Atlantic to turn up of the coast of Africa to head up a river in Mali and then become beached and covered in sand. This was recorded in some cave painting and was recalled in the legend of a ""Death Ship"" by some locals. It apparently bought a disease that wiped out a lot of life. What all this means to us the audience is nothing because none of the questions posed by this series of events is answered in the film. Why did the ship cross the Atlantic? Why was it called a ""Death Ship""? What was it's destination? Who was on it? What happened to them? The filmmakers went to a lot of trouble to build a super set of the ship only to fill it full of holes - rather like the plot! The rest of the plot is based around a river being polluted with poisonous toxic waste from an illegal chemical dumping site run by a French baddie (nice for it not to be an English baddie for once!!). The suspense is built up because the toxic waste is nearing the Atlantic and if it reaches salt water it will exponentially multiply to cover all the water of the world. However, once they kill an evil warlord and the CIA assassinate the French baddie by serving him a dodgy drink of water in a restaurant - everything is OK. The toxin is miraculously cleared up and an antidote developed.If all this plot description sound like nonsense to you - it should. I wrote it down as I saw it. Completely confused and no amount of charisma in the lead roles is going to cure that. I guess it is all the fault of the director; Breck Eisner(the son of Michael Eisner). I don't know how he got this gig (snigger) but if it was my money - I wouldn't be handing him the reins of a big budget again anytime soon.Go and see it for some ridiculous over the top action but don't try to make sense of the plot - 'cos there ain't one.",Sahara
169,aka-45316,A Completely Underrated and Overlooked Gem,10,12 September 2020,"This movie is a little something that my family and I would watch together on occasion. Every time we saw it, we'd have the time of our lives and be left with feelings of happiness and joy.When I later found out about the mixed to negative reputation this movie received, as well as discovered the lack of success it had at the box office, I was deeply surprised. The only thing I don't know is what audiences think of the film, really.Even now, I find this movie to be an absolute masterpiece. An unexpectedly underrated one too.For instance, the direction by Breck Eisner, and the screenplay by James V. Hart, Thomas Dean Donnelly, Joshua Oppenheimer, and John C. Richards, were spectacular!What I particularly enjoyed was the filmmakers's ability to have the film acknowledge itself for what it is, but at the same time...create something that was instantly fun. At times, it may seem like the usual ""treasure hunting adventure"" sort of story. However, the film team created a concept that was unique and different on its own too, and it feels like a lot of passion and heart was put into it. Along with that, the story and plot line was intriguing to a tee, and everything tied together like a rope to a hook. The comedy aspect of the film was also marvelously well-done, with every joke being excellently executed and having wonderful innocence. There was powerful heart and emotion as well, the particular generators being the friendship between Dirk and Al, and the romance between Dirk and Eva. The action sequences were likewise deeply exhilarating, and the mystery aspect of the movie was grippingly engaging.The acting, casting, characters, and character development were astounding as well. Each character had a personality that made them remarkably unique and full of life, and the performers fit their parts like a glove and looked like they were having a great time portraying their characters and being part of the movie. And while it may not seem like it at first, the characters had phenomenal growth.It was Matthew McConaughey, Steve Zahn, and Penelope Cruz that I thought gave the best performances, and the characters of Dirk Pitt, Al Giordino, and Eva Rojas had wonderful development and shared entertaining chemistry between one another. I would like to add that Lennie James did an amazing job portraying Zateb Kazim, and his character was not only intimidating but a deliciously classical villain; Rainn Wilson was likewise quite a scene-stealer as Rudi Gunn, and his character was a lovable guy to be around; and, William H. Macy was wonderful in the role of James Sandecker, portraying his character with a personality that was both authoritative and admirable.Finally, the music by Clint Mansell was magnificent. Mansell gave the film so many wonderful melodies that were instantaneously memorable, and they fit perfectlywith the African settings and the movie's tone and concept, an example being the music used for the boat montage. Plus, the songs that were incorporated into the movie boosted the film all-the-more into being something fun to watch, such as Dr. John's ""Right Place Wrong Time"" and Grand Funk's ""We're an American Band"".In conclusion, ""Sahara (2005)"" is an underrated gem that's all-out enjoyable. The performers and characters were incredible, the comedy was hilarious, everything!",Sahara
170,mundsen,Finally: an adventure film that's actually fun,8,25 December 2005,"Genre movies are harder to make than art films; in a year of dull turkeys (Batman Begins, War of the Worlds), this one's quite a goodie. Cheerful, amusing, good-humoured, and with a feel all its own.The nice thing is that it's not really that campy: it's profoundly implausible, but quite straight-faced, tho' most of the characters have senses of humour.Above all, it looks good. This is one of the best-photographed actioners I've ever seen, a superb advertisement for location shooting. Beautiful, beautiful places, and excellent art-design. And how refreshing to get away from the claustrophobic worlds of CGI (why do CGI movies seem so damned airless?) The script is damned good (not so much for plot, but for dialogue). This director is obviously an actor's best friend: just watch the extras and stunt-persons. The rapport between the two male leads rivals Hope and Crosby; you could probably enjoy watching these guys strip paint.Downers: Penelope Cruz is pure mahogany, though the script doesn't help her at all (the character is a bit of a worthy bore - where's Ingrid Bergman when you need her?). The part really needed someone as verbally quick as the guys; Cruz just can't compete. It's Anna Sten all over again...The music is a bit sucky. The African music is fine. The original score is full of John Barryisms, which put us in a very odd headspace at times - particularly as the plot gets very Bondish. The 70's panel-head source music (""Sweet Home Alabama"" et al) gives weird flashbacks to ""Apocalypse Now"", which is presumably the intention; but I'm not sure the 'ugly American' comparison is something that necessarily works for the film-makers.Still, I hope this heralds a franchise. And that the budgets don't get any bigger.",Sahara
171,Moonhawk1975,Fast-paced adventure rises above it's own mediocrity,10,10 April 2005,"No treasure-hunting adventure film is ever going to live up to the standard set by the Indiana Jones trilogy. All that is left for a filmmaker to do when making one, is to make one that is entertaining. It seems they can never make the absurd seem plausible, so it is best for us as the average moviegoer to forget how silly these movies really are and just sit back and be entertained. This movie succeeds splendidly in doing so.Matthew McConaughey plays adventurer Dirk Pitt, in Africa with his deep-sea recovery employers bringing a rare artifact to the surface. While there, an underground contact informs him of a rare coin which he believes came from a Civil War Ironclad battleship he speculates made its way to Africa. Enlisting the aid of his sidekick (Steve Zahn), he convinces his boss (William H. Macy) to let him search for the fabled boat. Of course, he must escort a W.H.O. doctor (Penelope Cruz) upriver as well; she is seeking the source of a mysterious plague. Along the way, they encounter warring African troops and a megalomaniacal French businessman.There is a lot of plot to this movie and it all gets pretty jumbled. The movie is more about the search for the disease than it is a treasure hunt picture. Given the villains, at times the movie plays like a James Bond picture. I would have preferred for everything else to have been in the background and centered more on the Ironclad. But, this movie is very entertaining. McConaughey is not going to win any awards here, but he plays the part very well. He is charming and funny and fully capable of getting himself out of whatever situation the movie can put him into. Cruz iswell, she's not as bad as she is in everything else. I just have a problem with the way she talks; the accent is too thick and her dialogue stilted. Macy and Delroy Lindo (as a CIA agent) are underused, but make the best out of their parts. Macy, especially, has fun with his wisecracks. The star of the movie, however, is Zahn. I don't think he has a single line that is not a funny throwaway and practically every one of them had the theater I saw this at in stitches. He is a positive point to any movie he is in; most of the time he's the best thing about that movie. Director Breck Eisner has done a commendable job here. He could have put more effort on the screenplay level to streamline the action and add more explanation to the events; there is too much going on and, as written, none of it makes much sense. As it is, he has put together a string of exciting action sequences; from the opening Civil War battle to a river chase in Nigeria to many, many more in the desert. I've always said, no matter how good or bad a movie is, as long as you blow up enough stuff I'll be happy! This is a good popcorn picture; nothing more, nothing less.",Sahara
172,thelawrences,A lot of fun if you suspend your sense of reality,8,19 May 2005,"I've never read any of the Dirk Pitt movies, but I really enjoyed this movie. I thought the 2 story lines were woven well, the Dr's mission gave it somewhat of a ""noble"" cause, and surprisingly it was incredibly ""clean"" (regarding language and sexual content) which is always a plus for me. Some of the fight scenes stretched the bounds of reality (why can't the bad guys ever hit anything, even though that's what they're trained to do?) The characters were engaging and fun to watch. If you go to the movies for some deep message or moral, skip this one. But if you want to go just for a couple hours of escapism, Sahara does the trick. If they make another Dirk Pitt film, I'd go see it - assuming McConaughey plays the lead - in fact, I might just have to try reading one of the books!",Sahara
173,kenhe,A truly miserable mess,1,29 March 2007,"Yes I have read the Clive Cussler novel Sahara, indeed several times, and I have read and enjoyed all the rest of Clive's action adventures. NO, I did not expect the movie Sahara to be an accurate film version of the novel but I hardly expected it to be so completely different from the novel. The whole point of the novel, the tracking of a dangerous waste toxin, was almost ignored by the movie, and replaced by the search for the Confederate gold. But worse, while the novel followed a logical progression and led inevitably to various plot complications, like the encounter with the various West Africa navies, or the discovery of Kitty Mannock's lost airplane, the movie plot just sort of pulled these encounters off the shelf and shoved them in. I felt the acting was just pitiful and brought to mind the other Clive Cussler novel which had been produced as a movie, a bad truly awful movie, called Raise the Titanic! I cannot help but think that the producers of this turkey simply bit off more than they could ever hope to chew. All the subplots in the novel Sahara combined to produce a really interesting story. In the movie all the subplots just couldn't be effectively fitted in and the movie was just wasn't big enough to contain them.",Sahara
174,Simba4,Totally improbable but highly entertaining,7,6 September 2005,"I wasn't expecting much when I rented this because the critics didn't think much of it. But I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was actually pretty good! Definitely worth renting! It's kind of a cross between National Treasure (treasure hunters), Mummy (desert setting), and Indiana Jones (action and comedy). Penelope Cruz is sexy as always but her role is actually quite believable as a WHO doctor trying to help dying Africans. Steve Zahn is hilarious as sidekick to Matthew McConahey (not spelling that right I'm sure). Our 8-year old watched most of it (the non-violent parts) and liked it too. So if you can suspend reality for two hours and just enjoy an old-fashioned action flick where the good guys win, the bad guys get what they deserve, and the hero gets the girl, this is a perfect movie.",Sahara
175,bquick94,Still waiting for a sequel!,10,22 March 2018,"This movie did a great job at making a modern Indiana Jones based off the Clive Cussler character, I don't see why Hollywood is wasting everyone's time making more awful Tomb Raider remakes when there are tons of Dirk Pitt story's to get into! Not to mention how much better an actor McConaughey has become, and such a badass Dirk Pitt is. I'd say it's about time there's a big enough fan-base for this. Let's get it going learn from whatever mistakes you think this movie made and perfect the damn sequel. Why not we have enough remake disasters.",Sahara
176,aerovian,Good entertainment all-in-all for the mature man,8,10 January 2010,"Although some of the script and action in this movie really stretch the bounds of ""suspension of disbelief"", I found myself pretty much engrossed throughout because of its fast pace and a reasonably well crafted plot with plenty of twists and turns. The cast lineup is excellent for the over-30 demographic, the production values are remarkably good, and the soundtrack just rocks with an eclectic lineup of tunes that really put a person in the mood for action. And after all, Clive Cussler is all about pure, escapist action -- no more, no less. Steve Zahn gives us lotsa larfs to boot. So guys, sit back with a tall one of your favourite beverage, hit the mute button on the discerning part of your brain, crank up the audio, and enjoy a great 2-hour ride with Sahara.",Sahara

179,stratowing,If handled seriously- would have been major hit,5,19 April 2005,"Had this movie been handled more seriously, with limited and clever comic relief...it would have been a huge hit, imho. But... Its a formula-flick with ridiculously unrealistic scenarios, and perhaps the dumbest, lamest, overused comic relief lines I've ever heard. Cool scenery and locations, but it had the typical scenarios: 100 guys armed with military weapons firing at you at near point blank range.... you roll on the ground and mow them all down with your little pistol.5 or 6 machine-gun-armed military men in military boats firing on a single UNarmed(for the most part) civilian boat a few yards in front of it, and miraculously the boat's seats, sides, rear etc get filled with bullet holes, but NO ONE gets hit! WOW cool.......NOT.I'm not complaining that the ""good guys"" don't get hit, but rather, that the audience is not given a REASON TO BELIEVE that the gunners could miss. That's whats missing ...a plausible reason to believe.Have fun with it, but don't expect to be absorbed in the story. (maybe the whole thing was a tongue-n-cheek comedy and I didn't get it)?",Sahara
180,SmithWrite,A fun time for all,8,10 April 2005,"I'm extremely perplexed at the lukewarm and especially the bad reviews this one is getting from the professional critics, because my husband and I both found it a very enjoyable romp. Yes, you have to suspend your disbelief during some of the action sequences, but I don't remember people complaining about the lack of realism in the Indy Jones or ""Romancing the Stone"" series. The dialogue (especially the buddy banter and William H. Macy's character) is amusing, the plot easy to follow despite its complexities, and the action virtually nonstop. I also found it refreshing for the sidekick to look like a doofus, but actually more than hold his own during crunch time.I can only assume the negative reactions are from fans of the book (I have never read any Clive Custler, so it may well depart from it in tone or otherwise.) But judged solely on its merits as a light-hearted adventure movie, it more than met my expectations.",Sahara
181,TheFluffyKnight,Sahara,3,21 September 2008,"Genre-defining moments in any medium are a double-edged sword, leading as they do to herds of imitators and pretenders. Punk, visceral and anti-establishment in the 1970s, gave rise to a plethora of bland Blink- 182s in the '90s. The Lord of the Rings, the grandfather of epic high fantasy, spawned shelves full of bland paperbacks. And Raiders of the Lost Ark, a wry reinvention of 1930s adventure serials, led to swarms of bland action-adventure films. A recent example of which is Sahara, a film that fails on the adventure, but succeeds admirably on the bland.Sahara centres on laughably-named adventurer Dirk Pitt, played by Matthew McConaughey. McConaughey must have some sort of appeal, perhaps to young women, or teenage boys who like their role models slimy and irritating. He plays Pitt how we might imagine Indy to be, had he spent his time at archaeology school getting drunk and playing video games. Pitt is joined by his best mate Al Giordino (Steve Zahn). Zahn appears to be making a name for himself playing comic sidekicks who are distinctly lacking in the comic.Pitt is obsessed with lost Confederate ironclad warship CSS Texas, which he believes, after the American Civil War, made its way to West Africa. Obviously. While searching the African coast, Pitt and Giordino come across Eva Rojas (Penélope Cruz), a doctor with the World Health Organisation investigating an epidemic in the area.One of the problems with Sahara's plot (and there are many) is that these two elements, Pitt's warship and Rojas' epidemic, are never linked. It is implied early on that the ironclad (dubbed the ""Ship of Death"" by the locals) could be the cause of the mysterious disease, but this is never followed through. Instead, Pitt's search for the ship becomes an arbitrary and derivative subplot that occasionally interrupts the film's main narrative.A main narrative that is also arbitrary and derivative. Sahara eventually deals with malevolent African warlords, toxic waste, and a potentially global environmental catastrophe. So, nothing we haven't seen before. And certainly nothing we haven't seen done better. The action is decidedly mediocre, never reaching the level of creativity or excitement achieved in the classic adventure films Sahara so badly wants to be.This mundanity might have been forgivable, were the film carried by memorable and engaging characters. Unfortunately, it isn't. McConaughey and Zahn have an undeniable chemistry, but their characters' relationship is juvenile and lacks any real depth. Cruz's doctor seems more interested in her predictable relationship with Pitt than in the epidemic sweeping across West Africa, making her role as a physician less than believable. Even William H. Macy, usually eminently watchable, phones it in as Pitt's exasperated benefactor.Sahara's biggest problem, though, is it's questionable politics. It is true that adventure films have never been the most politically correct in the medium, presenting non-western countries as dangerous, and their natives violent, ignorant, or both. But these films were either made at a time when this was acceptable; or set at such a time, and use hindsight to mock this conservative tendency.Sahara, however, was neither made, nor is it set, at such a period. So why is it that when Pitt saves Rojas from assassination, it is strongly implied her African assailant is about to rape her? Why are the native Tuareg a cowardly lot, unwilling to fight against the film's oppressive warlord. And why is it that the only people who can defeat this warlord are three minimally equipped white people?It could (and will, no doubt) be argued that all this is irrelevant when taken in the context of the film's (alleged) sense of fun. But I find it dismaying that the entertainment perpetually pumped into the eyes of the movie-going public is as insidiously racist and nationalistic as Sahara.When all is said and done, I'm sure that none of this will matter. The people handing over their money to see Sahara aren't interested in the politics of racial representation in Hollywood. They want constructed, meaningless mediocrity. And Sahara has that in spades.",Sahara
182,clint-cole,Decent Flick,7,21 December 2005,"Sahara begins with a visually stunning battle scene. This scene is possibly the best part of the whole movie. The rest of the movie revolves around that scene.The plot development is great at first. The structure is two different plots intertwining into one, with the two main characters bumping into each other throughout. It begins as suspenseful and realistic... To bad it doesn't keep those two elements up.The movie flows into some twists that have you rolling your eyes. Also, the music was inappropriate at some points, playing scores that had noting to do with the plot, location, mood, etc.I found myself gripped at first, then bored by the end. Overall, this movie is a Tuesday night yawner. Have a beer and watch while the laundry runs.6.5(7)/10... possible degrade to 6 later.",Sahara
183,notdempsey,Lawrence of Arabia...With Explosions.,6,25 May 2005,"Were I to try and explicate every aspect of ""Sahara,"" based on number 11 of novelist Clive Cussler's best-selling 'Dirk Pitt Adventures,' you would be faced with a review rivaling Dostoyevsky in length. Rather, I offer a laundry list of the things this mastodon of a movie crams into just over two hours: A treasure hunt, a plague, a diabolical plot, slavery, genocide, global disaster, not one, but TWO civil wars, and Mathew McConaughey's southern twang.All these things come together in a climactic desert showdown between the 200-year-old cannon of a Confederate ironclad and an African dictator in a helicopter straight from the scrap-yard of 'Black Hawk Down.' And by the way, the ironclad is in the middle of the desert, and it's filled with treasure, and has landed right near some verboten solar energy plant that, much to the dismay of Greenpeace, produces some sort of toxic sludge that is leaking into an underground river, slowly poisoning the world's water supply. Oh, and the cannonballs, well, they explode.If the audience with whom I watched 'Sahara' laughed at this, I couldn't tell over the action. That's not a negative statement, either: I LITERALLY wouldn't have been able to hear laughter over the explosions, engines, and toe tappin' soundtrack of golden oldies and cool tribal pop.Maybe that's a good rule for Michael Bay to consider before signing off on one of his quiet, trademark love scenes: Will the audience be able to hear each other laughing? If not, put the love scene in the middle of a tornadoan exploding tornado!In terms of acting, this is McConaughey's final exam: The cowboy has been on the verge of stardom since he made Atticus Finch look like George Wallace with his soulful closing argument in the Jim Crow legal drama 'A Time to Kill,' but he's yet to gain membership to that 100 million dollar club where he'd rub elbows with Tom Hanks and Harrison Ford. Stephen Holden of the New York Times blames the Texas-boy's pseudo-stardom status on that prairie-dog accent of his. But then how do you explain Hillary Swank's winning streak? Ain't she po' white trash, too? Personally, I blame the actor's chiseled features. He is ridiculously good looking. His face is perfect and rubbery in that artificial way that has proved troublesome for Ben Affleck and will probably prevent 'Memento's' Guy Pierce, who could cut diamonds on his cheekbones, from becoming a major player any time soon. Like a picture hung to break-up a pristine, white wall, so does that scar on the chin for the otherwise flawless Harrison Ford, that nappy hair for Tom Hanks, or Clark Gable's Dumbo-like ears, give us a point of reference when gawking at these Adoni.I must admit, however, that McConaughey proves, in 'Sahara,' that he has the star quality needed to command the respect of a major action picture, even surrounded by the intimidating likes of William H. Macy and Delroy Lindo. Penelope Cruz also does just fine as a U.N. style doctor who's investigations into an Nigerian epidemic get her tangled up with Dirk Pitt and his roughnecks, led by a trucker-chic Steve Zahn. Many people find Cruz's thick accent frustrating and difficult to decipher, but she really has a beautiful voice, one that you become hypnotized with in some of her Spanish-language films including ""All About My Mother"" and ""Open Your Eyes,"" where you can experience it in it's natural habitat. In English, the accent acts as a kind of camouflage; if any of her American performances have been artificial, I wouldn't know, because EVERYTHING she says in English sounds artificialthe artificial of someone who's learning the language, however, not necessarily of a bad actress. Moreover, it gives her charactersumcharacter. Andwellit's kind of hot.So far I've embraced and spoke kindly of this film's ludicrous plot. It would be disingenuous, however, to call 'Sahara' flawless--even relative to other action movies. It's quite odd really: Not once did I doubt, or was I bothered by, the absurdity of 'Sahara' until somewhere around the end of act II, when McConaughey, Zahn, and Cruz discover, quite by accident, the verboten toxic solar plant. From here on out, the film abandons the fun of Indiana Jones for the predictability of James Bond: the gang is captured, the girl held prisoner by the evil millionaire as he discusses the specifics of his master plan, and the fortress set to blow up as said millionaire scurries away cowardly. But why were these scenes so distracting? Why is a hidden solar energy plant so much less credible than a battleship buried in the desert? Maybe the real James Bond movies own the market on high-tech bunker scenes.It isn't surprising that 'Sahara,' goes all Bond in the end, though. After all, there are 17 other Dirk Pitt novels, and director Breck Eisner and Paramount aren't shy about wanting a 007-length franchise (From the poster: ""Adventure has a new name. Dirk Pitt,"" from the movie: ""Maybe you could help us (the CIA) out from time to time""). But while the 700 page 'Sahara' is a relatively long Dirk Pitt adventure, few of them fall below the thickness of the Oxford English Dictionary; if every one of these movies will be as chock-full as 'Sahara,' I may need to start bringing MetRx bars with me to the theater.",Sahara
184,Daryl-7,Loved It!,9,14 November 2006,"We just loved this movie. A thriller from start to finish. Yes, it fits nicely into the Indiana Jones model. So what? It works.Matthew McConaughey is looming large as one of Hollywood's best leading men, especially for action/adventures. My wife and I have been lamenting the loss of our best action heroes (Bruce Willis, Mel Gibson, etc.) - they're all just too old. And who is supposed to take over? The Rock?? Vin Diesel?? No fricking way. Matthew M. is going to lead the charge.Steve Zahn was an amazing sidekick. Loved him. And if Penelope Cruz was any more beautiful, well, let's just say she was a more than capable leading lady - tough, smart and lovely.I loved the chemistry between these three. Saying William H. Macy was excellent seems obvious (he's always excellent).Anyway, loved the entire movie, from front to back. Haven't read Cussler's books, but now I'm thinking about picking up a copy of one of them.The only thorn in my side the entire movie was the soundtrack. What the hell???? Sweet Home Alabama when they're driving around Africa? Couldn't you find any suitable music for a desert adventure? The Faces? Seventies rock 'n roll? Are you kidding me? I mean, I love that music, but it was such a non sequitur with the story that it jarred me out of my seat. (And that's hard to do once I'm settled, let me tell ya.) Superb casting. Great acting. Nice story. Top notch entertainment.",Sahara
185,chuckc,Where are the Stooges When We Need Them?,4,9 August 2005,"""Sahara"" so strained my credulity that I feared it would snap and give me whiplash. The strain started with the name of the hero: Dirk Pitt. Now there's a manly name. I found myself coming up with even more outrageous names, ala ""Mystery Science Theater."" How about ""Rock Hardin""? ""Harry McChest""? ""Punch Meatslab""? ""Buck Bronzeback""? ""Dick Steele"" was already taken.The plot is basically part Steve Sommers's ""The Mummy,"" mixed with a touch of Indiana Jones and a pinch of James Bond. Dirk and his sidekick Al (why not a better sidekick name, like ""Buzz"" or ""Fuzzy""?) are on a quest to find a lost Confederate ironclad battleship, which managed to make its way across the Atlantic and up an African river, only to be buried in the treacherous sands of the Sahara. Never mind that you don't have to be a ship designer to know that such a vessel would have less chance of making it across the Atlantic than a rubber ducky. Never mind that this fact is pointed out to Dirk more than once by other characters. You're just supposed to go with it.Such movies need to have a sense of giddy fun about them, like Sommers's ""Mummy."" Much of the fun is stripped out with a parallel quest involving Penelope Cruz as a World Health Organization doctor trying to track down the source of a contagion that's spreading from the country of Mali and into Nigeria. I don't know about you, but juxtaposing the story of two treasure-hunting frat boys with that of a doctor trying to stop the spread of a contagion that threatens the lives of thousands of people kind of bled some of the fun away for me.There's also a warlord so mean that he, well, ""put the 'war' back in 'warlord.'"" (I wonder where the war went?) He's hell bent on covering up the contagion, taking bribes from a big corporation that's using his country as a toxic waste dump (the source of the contagion, which is conveniently located near the buried battleship), and fighting a group of ragtag warlord wannabes. Oh, and this contagion, if it reaches the ocean, will cause a worldwide environmental disaster. With me so far?Dirk and Al cheerfully wisecrack their way across Mali as they blow up their boss's speedboat, bounce along on camels, dodge bullets, save the doc, and wreak havoc at a high-tech installation that would be right at home in a James Bond flick. Clues drop in their laps like manna from heaven. My favorite is a cave painting that tells them everything they need to know. With hints like these, the Three Stooges could find this battleship. (In fact, this would've been a great vehicle for Moe, Larry, and Curly.)",Sahara
186,maheshmanutd,Maybe The Most Underrated Film,9,11 December 2010,"Sahara is one of the biggest financial flops of Hollywood.Critics rating doesn't hold that good either. But for me, this is one of the best wholesome entertainers I have ever seen. Action, adventure and comedy at its very best.The credit for making this movie a visual extravaganza goes to the direction, cinematography and especially art direction. The movie highlights the natural beauty of Africa. The action sequences shot at River Niger is a perfect example.The movie showcases some breathtaking action sequences. Well, it should, considering about the 130 million dollars poured into the movie. The film is fast, free flowing without giving a single minute of boredom like unwanted romance, sentiments or even unwanted dialogues. The movie is made to be a comic action adventure entertainer and does full justice to its genre.Had this movie become a success, then Matthew McConnaughey would have been a real superstar by now. Such is the powerful,cheesy acting he features. It is a shame really that this movie did not succeed.The supporting cast is superb, especially William Macy and Lennie James. Lennis James makes the villain the most memorable character of the film. Well, if you want to lie on your back, crack a snack and get some fun, then this is the movie for you. Once again, too bad it was a flop.",Sahara
187,jdfcanada,A somewhat predictable action flick,6,7 April 2005,"Basically this is a weaker Indiana Jones movie, with the hero getting out of narrow escapes and searching for treasure while trying to fight evil. The big difference here is that Dirk Pitt is a former Navy SEAL, not a scholar like Indy.It's a rather formulaic action/thriller with very little in the way of surprises. If you think that 'x' will happen, it does. The only thing that surprised me was how good Matthew McConaughey was as an action star, alhtough he is a little too tanned. While he's no Schwarznegger or even Harrison Ford, he pulled off the role of Dirk Pitt very well. Steve Zahn also provides excellent comic relief. Alas, Penelope Cruz is exposed as the poor actress she really is. I honestly think Madonna could have done better than she did.I don't know if it'll do well enough to spawn sequels, but it could be a franchise in the making, which is obviously what Paramount thought when it bought the rights to Clive Cussler's book (who wrote tons of sequels). Still, it's not a bad movie and it might be worth seeing in the 'cheap' (second-run) theatres.",Sahara

189,davidsrose,"Average action flick, completely miscast",6,9 April 2005,"I'm beginning to think that Clive Cussler may end up like Alistair MacLean: a wildly successful author of pretty formulaic action thrillers who never had a good film made of them, despite a number of tries. In Sahara, Cussler's original plot is eviscerated, and the casting, while picking decent actors, does a major disservice to the series.For anyone who's read the books, Mathew McConnaughey looks nothing like Dirk Pitt, Steve Zahn even less like Al Giordino (short, hairy, dark, powerfully built Italian??), and Rainn Wilson acts not a whit like Rudi Gunn. Even Bill Macy, always a good actor, while sporting Sandecker's beard, is at least ten years too young for the role, and about six inches too tall.Bottom line is that it's a standard weekend action flick but bears little relation to the characterizations and backstory of the novels (sigh).",Sahara
190,DCJerzeygrl,Sahara is worth a look,8,24 February 2005,"By accident, I caught an advance screening of this movie last night in DC. I'd heard negative reviews, but thankfully did not let that cloud my judgment. The chemistry between Matthew McConaughey & Steve Zahn is palpable. I didn't think the chemistry between Penelope & Matthew sizzled, till the end. But since we all know now that they're together...I find it amusing. Good for them!! The location shots for this movie are phenomenal, esp Morocco. I'm bringing ALL my Moroccan friends to the movie when it is released. It's similar to National Treasure, but not as slick. There was more sarcastic humor throughout National Treasure, but there's great buddy chemistry in Sahara. I HOPE that Steve Zahn & Matthew McConaughey do a sequel or at least another movie together. This film is worth the price of full admission.",Sahara

Attempting a young Indiana Jones type of adventure would work. But why the hell would a bunch of former US marines and navy seals hunt for a US Civil War semi-submarine boat (which was one time bullet proof) in West Africa? A storm took it there? Man, I could understand somewhere in Cuba, Canada, New Foundland or even Bermuda, but not Africa. Jokes apart, I could not stop laughing at that ridiculous idea! Everything in the movie was convenient for the adventure. Everything located in the right place at the right time. Even James Bond movies never left so many loop holes open.However, Mathew McConaughy's character of Dirk Pitt was good. They could consider making another movie with that character, but please have a story with at least half as many loop holes and crappy ideas.I gave it a 6, generously.",Sahara
192,nobletraveler,Total Disrespect Shown to Clive Cussler,2,10 August 2018,"This movie IS NOT a Dirk Pitt adventure. It's another Hollywood Fiasco.

I can understand why he got so mad. Matthew McConaughey should be ashamed of his work. The characters of this movie are NOTHING like the characters Mr. Cussler developed.

You won't like it. A lot of the negative reviews for this complain about the believability of some of the action scenes and how stupid the henchmen are. This is true - some of the scenes are flat out stupid if you scrutinise them, but if that's what you want to do, what are doing watching an action flick with Matthew McConaughey and Steve Zahn as the lead roles? I mean come on - Steve Zahn? If you just want to see something mindless and enjoyable then this is a great movie. The plot is very dubious indeed, so just forget about that. The chemistry between the main actors is great and the film moves from action scene to comedy scene to action scene with a kind of happy-go-lucky indifference to things such as realism that you can't help but get swept along for the ride.I enjoyed this movie from start to finish and would recommend it to anyone who's looking for a bit of mindless entertainment.

194,swiftyl,A void. Avoid!,1,13 April 2005,"If only 0 was an option for voting. I see a lot of movies and this is for sure the worst in the last 18 months. Do you pick on the unfocused direction, hokey committee writing , ugly cinematography or crap acting? So many choices. A night school course on how to use a scope lense without squeezing and stretching peoples' faces would have been handy. But let's look to the positive- what did this flick teach us? Africa ROCKS!!! Every time something needs to happen big rock blares out for no good reason, the Africans don't even seem to notice it- then again- Africans don't notice people (SPOILER)kicking the entire back out of a pick up truck, leaping onto a train from camels in the middle of the desert etc etc. To be honest McConnaughey and Cruz are always light weight, they're not stars, the action based on a Clive Cussler book is the star. Sadly this star was strangled, sodomized and left to bleed to death in a Nigerian back alley. One look at how the writers credits are arranged on the title card warns of direness to come. Surprises are few and far between, at one stage i leaned over to my movie buddy and said ""if this prick uses the damn ironclad ship buried in the desert to shoot down a helicopter I'll scream"" He did, I did.

195,DumaNV,A Different Dirk Pitt,7,1 May 2005,"For those of you that are strict Dirk Pitt fans please forgive this film. To enjoy this film you need to detach the Dirk Pitt from the Clive Cussler novels a bit and simply enjoy the movie.It is a good movie, fun, funny, adventurous and satisfying. It moves along at a very good pace and is worth watching on the big screen. The teaming of Matthew McConaughey (Pitt) and Steve Zahn as Giordino works about 80% of the time and it really works well when they have the banter when things get hot. The plot is well written drawing much of it from the novel and throwing in some interesting twists and smiles.I plan to put this in my DVD library for several reasons but mostly because it is a pretty decent action film that does not need language, nudity or large bloody events to move the story along  a rare thing these days.",Sahara
196,Guerauxguex,"Bravo Mr Cussler! not bad Hollywood, you didn't monkey with it too much & make it unrecognizable",6,2 August 2005,"When I first saw adverts on the telly for Sahara I thought ""action adventure bang bang boom flick, interesting but not enough so to pay $10"". Last week I discovered that it was the film adaptation of one of my favourite Clive Cussler novels! I just *HAD* to see it on the big screen. The only place it was playing in Texas was at a dollar theatre in San Antonio, so off I go, 5 hours & 300 miles round trip. $1.50 a ticket. I read the reviewer who pointed out it was matinée-ish, with set pieces each building on the other & bigger than the last. Perhaps this is one of the small things I found uncomfortable about the film. Being a fan of the novels, I feel Mr. Cussler tends to use a steady undercurrent of tension, like an undertow at the beach, with an ending like a riptide. I can only imagine the herculean efforts Mr. Cussler had to make to keep things in hand & maintain a decent semblance of his story. Strengths: Dirk is well cast & played by Matthew McConaughey. The basic plot is intact. The action is pretty good (still relies on the big bang boom tho'). WH Macy makes for a good Adm. Sandecker. THE CAR IS IN IT! The climax is pure Cussler/Pitt. Surprisingly, the soundtrack of 70's American Rock works well. A bit startling at first, it took a bit of mulling over & the decision finally came to rest on the positive side. Weaknesses: Several minor details were changed for no beneficial reason; Dirk & Al are now former USN SeALs instead of Air Force pilots. Sandecker's beard is a full-face feature rather than a Van Dyke. Rudi Gunn is no longer a former SeAL, & is a chunky comic relief character. Borderline weaknesses (aka things that are different but turned out alright none the less) Al isn't a stocky swarthy Italian powerhouse. Well played by Steve Zahn, he's got just the right touch of sarcasm & mischief. I really thought he was closer to getting his character right than McConaughey, who was quite agreeable still the same. NUMA is a private endeavour much like it's real life counterpart, which actually sets up the tidy denouement. **SPOILER WARNING** I've said in other reviews that the attention span & bladder capacity of the average viewer are too limited to do faithful translations of novels to films. A few notable exceptions are Gettysburg, North & South, The Stand & Lonesome Dove. Budgetary constraints also preclude a cast of thousands & big battle sequences. Ergo, the abduction of President Lincoln is not included in the script. Hala Kamil never makes an appearance. Without the Secretary General of the UN, & without Sandecker as the head of a US governmental agency to call in favours & pull strings, there's no timely intervention by the UN quick reaction force, therefore no heroic stand at the Foreign Legion fort. In their place, the local Tuaregs make a timely appearance to save our heroes collective bacon. There is a terrific last stand by Dirk, Al & Eva at the CSS Texas tho', which leads to a great alternate ending which could just as easily have been in the novel! I take exception to the presentation of light machine gun armour piercing bullets being capable of penetrating the ironclad's armour, but this is fiction after all. Sadly, Prospector Clive Cussler & Periwinkle the burro, St. Julien Perlmutter & Hiram Yeager never make appearances. Conclusion: After a disagreeable experience 25 years ago with ""Raise the Titanic!"" Clive Cussler has permitted Hollywood to take another crack at his marvelous creation. This is an acceptable first outing & hopefully the lessons learned will be taken seriously & the mild troubles rectified. I don't know what other films might be in the works, but I read that there were 3 novels optioned (take that for what it's worth). Personally, I'd love to see ""Vixen 03"" & ""Night Probe!"" as films, but those are my personal favourites & Hollywood can't go wrong with any of the Dirk Pitt adventures. Which is not to say Hollywood can't MAKE it wrong. Very, very wrong. I still scratch my head trying to figure out how ""Raise the Titanic!"" turned out so modestly mildly mediocre. With such a great story, with such a capable cast, (albeit occasionally mis-cast) it should have been much better. Sahara banishes that demon, but doesn't blow it away. I recommend this as a rental for everybody, a purchase for fans, & I eagerly await the next installment. But I'll still see it at the dollar theatre.",Sahara
197,abahb1,Pale modern version of Indiana Jones,5,20 September 2005,"This movie had a lot of potential, but in the end, it just wasn't enough to make me want to see it again. Everything about it seems out of place. The soundtrack music, meant to invoker a certain nostalgia I think, is way out of place in most scenes (the only time it is used effectively is during the land sailing scene). The comedy at times is way too forced. The henchmen have to be the dumbest in screen history. You can forgive a little bit of this given that the movie is trying to take a page from the Indiana Jones trilogy, but they just make the henchmen way too stupid and unobservant.All in all, I can see why this film did not do the business at the theater that was expected of it. A shame, a good cast, just not a lot there for them to work with.",Sahara
198,gluttony14,"Descent, but nothing more",6,28 December 2005,"I had fun watching the movie, but felt thoroughly disappointed towards the end. What started out as a great adventure movie dumbed-down into a simple and stupid action movie.The movie would have been excellent, I think, if it had focused merely on the search for the Civil War ship. Sure, it's a preposterous plot: to think a Civil War ironclad could be found in the middle of the Sahara desert, but the greatest adventure movies of all time, the Indiana Jones movies, didn't really have plots that make that much sense either, did they? However, the movie adds another plot - one about a strange disease that strikes Africa, and naturally involves a conspiracy led by (again, naturally) a typical villain. I'm not saying who the bad guy is, although it's obvious it's him from the moment he appears on screen. This, as a subplot, could have still worked out. It is not, however, a subplot. It takes place as the main plot, with the search for the ironclad lowered to subplot status. And that is the decision that drops this movie down to a simple and stupid action movie, instead of a great adventure movie - using a stupid action-movie plot instead of a stupid adventure-movie plot. Why, oh why, did they do that? That being said, the movie does have its merits. The action scenes, particularly the early ones, are exciting and fast-paced. And some of the scenery in the movie is quite amazing, despite being almost entirely sand. But there's something captivating about dunes, at least in my opinion. And finally, while it is not the focus of the movie, no action flick can be perfect without humor and/or a comic sidekick - this movie has both, and uses them to good effect.It's worth a watch, if you're interested in this type of film. But don't go expecting too much - it misses the opportunity to transcend most films in its genre, and it's a damn shame.",Sahara

The movie lacks humor...and every try at it, it just doesn't happen. But the thing that killed the movie was the casting of one of the most horrible actors ever: Matthew McConaughey. This guy is just plain irritating, with his horrible accent and that macho attitude.....he tries to be an action figure in this movie but fails horrible.

200,thespian57,somewhat disappointing effort,5,27 December 2005,"The main complaint I have with this film is the characterizations. Particularly offensive was Al Giordino. This Al was nothing like Cussler describes him in the Pitt books. This guy is like one half of a comedy team most of the time. Gunn is not the efficient navy commander as portrayed by Cussler. He appears to be confused half the time and in fact played a major role in the ""Sahara"" novel. Sandecker was not the no-nonsense fitness nut we are used to seeing in the novels. Thes character changes were unnecessary for this film. The original personalities could have been intact and nothing would have suffered from the film.My other gripe is the omission of the Kitty Mannock Sequence from the prologue to this film. Moreover the Civil War prologue was completely different from the one in the novel. Why? It didn't have to be. 5 minutes spent on Kitty Mannock and 5 minutes on the civil war prologue would have been enough to set the stage.I wanted to see the major shoot out with Massarde's men in Fort Foreau as in the novel. Also the scene with Dirk and Al crossing the desert chained to the bed of a truck is an out of place comedy sketch. Not like them at all. The wind racer sequence made no sense at all without the Kitty Mannock prologue.All in all though much more action here than in ""Raise the Titanic"", and I enjoyed the portrayal of Dirk Pitt. I don't think they quite have it right yet and that was the major complaint of Author Cussler about ""Raise the Titanic"", and rightly so. I do think that this was a better effort than ""Raise the Titanic""",Sahara
201,striker-8,Dirk Pitt is amusing,5,9 December 2007,"Sahara is an entertaining adventure movie. It starts with a historic scene but do not follow it like ""Indiana Jones"", ""Mummy"" or ""National Treasure""... You can neither call it a comedy or a romantic movie but both has their share in Sahara.McConaughey or Zahn are not great, but you don't expect them to be in this action packed movie. Macy has a small part but makes his mark. Some of the scenes make disbelief but you can also forgive them because Sahara does not take itself so seriously.Penelope Cruze is the object of beauty. Although she appears in many serious movies I really don't see her as a great actress. But her lack of acting doesn't bother me for the first time in Sahara. She is really beautiful and it's enough for this movie.For me one of the greatest things in the movie is the use of the ball. Everyone who played football on the streets probably chased a lose ball to an unknown place. For those Sahara holds a beautiful surprise.For those who expect decent facts, a strong plot without flows, Sahara is a very bad choice. But if all you need is some entertainment without focusing too hard, this light-adventure probably won't disappoint you.",Sahara
202,pfelon,Good directing saves it,7,14 September 2005,"Yes, this is not a great movie. And yes, this is not what most would consider a good film. However, the limited acting of Zahn, MM, and Cruz give this film some life, and the the plot makes it truly live. Sad to say, but Eisner makes this movie move along, and the plot is a good one (Clive Cussler likely deserves most credit on this). As far as the treasure/mystery/comedy genre goes, this is the best in a long while. It's entertaining, bottomline. Like one of Cussler's novels, it keeps you interested for a few hours and, basically, makes you feel like you're working toward something. A solid 7 of 10, rent it and pop some popcorn. Cruz is hot (as always), so enjoy her if nothing else. Among the tops as far as Hollywood tripe goes.",Sahara
203,DrunkenMasterIV,Bulletproof Hunk,7,23 April 2005,"I've been reading mixed reviews of this movie and decided to put my own two cents in: I really enjoyed it. I may be biased, (I've been reading Clive Cussler novels for years), I read this book years ago. I was afraid the makers of this movie wouldn't be able to accurately depict Dirk Pitt. I thought Matthew McConaughey (sp?) made a great Dirk Pitt. If you read the books, Dirk is the tall, dark, brooding, handsome type. Al Giordino is the clown. This leads me to the next casting decision: Steve Zahn as Al Giordino. This move scared me because in the book Al is a stocky tough-guy type, like a James Gandolfini type or something. I was wrong...Steve was great! He played the role purely for laughs, and it worked! Here's the part the critics have problems with: Can a man be shot at 10,000 times and not get hit? No. Does the viewer care? No. Is there a heck of a lot of globe trotting in this movie? Yes. Are James Bond movies any different? No. Lets face it, this movie is James Bond American style. I think it works. It's a two hour roller coaster ride, and it's a lot of fun. It's a good start for what will hopefully be a franchise. What's next? Inca Gold? Cyclops? Flood Tide? Dragon? No matter which Clive Cussler adventure it is, I'm there.",Sahara
204,Mikeonalpha99,"""I'll find the bomb! You get the girl!""",3,7 September 2005,"Surely a movie starring the delectable Penelope Cruz and William H. Macy can't be all that bad. Well, when you have Penelope cast as a doctor from the World Health Organization, and Matthew McConaughey as a surfer-like deep see expert and treasure hunter, it's pretty much downhill from there.Sahara involves the adventures of Dirk Pitt (McConaughey) and his intrepid faithful sidekick Al Giordino (a rather forced Steve Zahn). Dirk has been searching for a Civil War Ironclad battleship that he and he alone believes somehow drifted from Virginia to Africa 140 years ago.While he plies the water of the coast of Niger, Dr. Rojas (Cruz) is determined to locate the cause of a baffling new plague in Mali. Her search has no real connection to Dirk and Al's quest, yet they keep running into one another in the vast wilderness so that they can keep rescuing each other from gun-toting African militia.The trio's escapades come to the attention of evil French entrepreneur Massarde (Lambert Wilson) and Mali strongman General Kazim (Lennie James) who send the entire Mali army after them to cover up the source of the rapidly spreading illness.First-time feature director Breck Eisner does a respectable job in maintaining forward momentum and he enlivens the proceedings with some quirky moments, especially the banter between the actors. The film's action set pieces come off quite effectively, including a battle between boats on a river, breaking into a mysterious power plant in the middle of the desert, and various skirmishes between our heroes and the general's faceless soldiers.But the movie is ultimately hampered by story is totally preposterous and unrealistic - a civil war ship ending up in a river in Africa! Please! There's absolutely no sense of plausibility to the plot and there's just to many leaps in logic as our heroes wisecrack their way through fights without a scratch. They also seem to have a remarkable immunity to bullets.Perhaps Sahara would have been considered a good action film thirty years ago when movie going tastes for this kind of fair where not as sophisticated, but these days a movie like this comes across as rather stale and formulaic. There's nothing much to Sahara that we though we haven't all seen before: glamorous girl, evil megalomaniac, swashbuckling hero, comic sidekick etc.I'm not sure whether Sahara's sloppily interconnected storyline comes from a blind fidelity to Clive Cussler's adventure novel or severe deviation from it. Whatever the case, you know that all is not right, when during the opening credits, you see an army of scriptwriters. I also can't quite fathom the inclusion of loud, clangy rock music into the soundtrack - surely African tribal music would have been more appropriate.On the plus side, the film's otherworldly locations and sets neatly blend into the startling vistas and spruce up the otherwise generic and standard happenings. But generally, Sahara is as flat as the desert on which most of the action takes place. Mike Leonard September 05.",Sahara

Don't get me wrong here, its just that the movie is not anything like indiana jones cross james bond, it is more like a normal action adventure in the dessert movie with 3 main characters. The plots are okay though and the suspense,comedy and actions are well placed but there is just not enough sparkle or a solid body for this movie to be a big hit, its just another normal play act dessert hunts like the ones we see at universal studios ( for those who have been there), I'm just voicing out my opinion as a viewer. The movie could have been made better with a bit of more added twist of story or maybe even some off the road moment or even by using more comedy scenes with a pinch of sex to make more exciting or so. Not all will agree with me but i guess i have the freedom to voice out anyway. Stories like these nowadays only attracts and appeal to younger generations mostly if I'm not mistaken. Fewer adults would like it; unless the purpose is only to watch Matthew or Penelope Cruz in it.

Wonderful cast, incredible special effects, all wasted on a ludicrous script. The chase scenes went on and on and on. The fight scenes went on and on and on. Both were obviously extended ad nauseam because the story was so weak. With a competent script writer it coulda been a blockbuster. Another disaster was the out of place alleged theme music. For the kind of money they spent making this movie they could have spent a little more and had a decent theme - or could they?

I understood why I went to see it -- an escape from reality. And, from that perspective, I was not disappointed in the least. Sahara doesn't even come close to touching on the real or the possible.But then I was disappointed by other elements. First, nobody smiles like that. Perhaps casting did find the perfect Dirk Pitt. But he smiles too much and no one in his line of work has teeth like that. Too smooth. Too charming. Too sure of himself. The challenging life is too easy. At least Indiana Jones struggled.And then there is Dr. Rojas. Why would a smart woman fall for a Dirk Pitt? Sure, women are women -- at least in the movies. But this woman is a dedicated healer. Dirk isn't dedicated to anything of the sort. But it's more than that they are just an odd couple. I was amazed at how quickly she switched from being a public servant to being an adventurer.I liked the unusual view of Africa. The most believable element of the script was the portrayal of the third world. There were places shown we have never seen in film before -- all my five points were awarded for this.Steve Zahn as Al Giordino played perhaps the best role. The comic side kick.

I really got a 'feel' for Africa by the use of genuine African music too - traditional and contemporary played......apart from the African music, it didn't hurt that a lot of my other favorite songs were played either.As far as the book was concerned - I felt the movie kept to the book as faithfully as the time constraints of movie making allows - I was sorry the Kitty Mannock scenes couldn't be used though, but agree it would've slowed the movie down.Not since Raiders of the Lost Ark have I felt so completely engrossed in an adventure movie from the opening scenes to the roll of the credits.Can't wait for Mr McConaughey to reprise his Dirk Pitt roll in the next adventure .....(hint hint) For pure escapism in the best sense this is a 10 out of 10 movie, and with no bad language or really graphic violence, it's one for the whole family.",Sahara

More stiff acting one has to search hard for.Pretty much each turn of events could be guessed about 5 minutes in advance, so you won't get any surprises here either.The precurser (10 minutes in the beginning, not really part of the plot) was kind of nifty though, played out in the 19th century with a steamboat looking like a stealth airplane bouncing canon balls off it's hull instead of radar waves. When the real plot kicked in though, it all went downhill.What does this flick has to offer? Who knows? What was it the writers wanted to tell? Who knows?",Sahara

Matt and Zahn do not spend the film fighting with each other, there is no sappy love story, Cruz and Matt don't start off hating each other and have to grow to love each other . . . none of that goop! It's just story and action from start to stop with some funny moments from Zahn along the way.I expected a little more action, but that's my only gripe. Cruz was not in the film that much, so she didn't really get much chance to annoy me like she usually does. And the action that was there was fun and exciting. I'd recommend this film for theater viewing, if only for the final big explosion! Just don't expect Indiana Jones, and you'll enjoy it.",Sahara
215,Electric_Sheep,Difficult to digest.,2,12 June 2005,"Intro ... A sort of Indiana Jones meets the Mummy well done opening scene, looks promising, offers suspense into the movie and sets the platform...The Scenario ... Dirk Pitt (Matthew M) our hero searches for the legendary Ironclad and as a sub plot, Doctor Rojas (Penelope Cruz) tries to find the location of a mysterious plague originating in Mali.The Story ... Insults our intelligence. If it was a spoof, comedy or Disney movie, all would be good but it's horribly full of clichés, boring chases and gun battles - and yet pretends to be taken seriously. Throw in some historical discoveries which come by fluke. Even more irritating is the loud rock soundtrack. Character development is tiny. On the plus all characters are somewhat likable except Cruz who suddenly jumps out of her emo specs, wish I could replace my specs like that. The plot just gets worse and worse.I did like the fabulous city in Mali which was breathtaking.Who Should Watch It ... Pre-teens would enjoy it, its a fun movie for that age group. Also it should be OK if you want to watch something very light and not ask questions.The next Indiana Jones? :-) Yes, right.",Sahara

What never happened to me, is that I fell asleep 2 times on 2 different days with the same damn movie. That is the case with ""Sahara"".This is probably the most boring movie I ever tried to watch. To be honest I've never completed watching it, because it makes my eyelids drop down like a garage door, and you wake up in the middle of the night, freezing and pain in the back.To me this is the worst movie ever.

This is a truly enjoyable adventure to watch.I don't agree with the character depiction based on how I think Cussler had built them, I expected Al to be a stocky Italian; Sandecker to be taller and beefier; Rudy more geeky; Dirk was fine. :) But I found that once I stopped drawing parallels to the images in my head, all was well. :) The action in the movie is great, the ""edge of reality"" story lines work well on screen; it's AWESOME to hear a soundtrack (and it's a good one!) with the story - I'll never read another Cussler book without one! :) I can be weird about continuity issues bothering me, and there are a couple of them in here, but they didn't bother me as much as much as ""usual"".

Very disappointing. Admittedly I lost interest 50 minutes into the movie and didn't even bother watching the rest. I would recommend to anyone to watch Hotel Rwanda rather than this piece of trash, as Hotel Rwanda is also centered in Africa but is based on a true story and has a respectable plot, respectable characters, and overall is a brilliant and emotional film. Having said that, I'm sure this film would be entertaining for children because it contains no mature concepts whatsoever, and is largely built upon a juvenile perception of adventure similar to that of Indiana Jones films.

Alas, I was sadly mistaken. ""Sahara"" seems to be trying much too hard to be some sprawling cinema epic, when in reality no movie with Steve Zahn ever could be. Blank, unexciting scenes, hollow dialogue, and mediocre acting from most ends of the spectrum make this a not-so-fun movie. Perhaps the oddest thing about this movies is the bizarre use of music (why would you play ""Sweet Home Alabama"" while our heroes are cruising the African coast?). ""Sahara"" isn't smart enough to follow the Hollywood rule of an explosion per minute; most of the action takes place in between half-hour sequences of ""plot"" (which I found somewhat hard to follow, and my eyes were glued to this big stupid movie the whole time). The truth is, this movie is so mediocre that it's not bad enough to laugh at, and not good enough to take seriously.",Sahara

They left out SO MUCH INFORMATION. Where's Abraham Lincoln? If you read the book, you will know what I mean. The only pleasant thing about this movie is the beautiful Penelope Cruz. Other than that, the actors they cast as Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino don't even come close to the descriptions in the book. Clive Cussler did not endorse this movie with good reason. I was very disappointed after waiting for years to see it. When is Hollywood going to finally understand that beautiful women, explosions, and mediocre action doesn't make up for things like story and character?Hopefully, someone will do this one right. The book is one of Cussler's best. Highly recommend reading it. I'm not putting down Mathew McConaghey or Steve Zahn. I'm not a big fan of McConaghey but I do like Steve Zahn quite a bit. He was great in Employee of the Month and Saving Silverman. They just don't fit the parts. PLEASE READ THE BOOK FIRST!",Sahara

I'm happy to say that fear has been put to rest. Sahara is a breath of fresh air in a VERY stale Hollywood that seems to be on a remake bent as of late. Some will compare this to Raiders/Indiana Jones, and call it a remake of sorts, but it's not really a ""remake"" as it's capturing the spirit of adventure on a grand scale. The Indy Jones series did the same thing with the serials of years past, and a lot of people who have not read the books probably wouldn't know that Dirk Pitt dates back to before Raiders (the early 1970's to be exact). In any event, enjoy this for what it is, an excellent popcorn flick that has the potential to be the next ""franchise"".",Sahara
223,rthomp-1,Much better than expected,8,23 April 2005,"I'll admit, as a reader of Dr. Cussler's work for more than 25 years, I was nervous about this film. I read a fair amount of unflattering reviews, I wasn't happy with the casting, and I was really concerned about Dr. Cussler's lawsuit.I shouldn't have been. This is a really fun movie that absolutely nails the spirit of the book, if not all the details. I pictured a mid-80s Tom Selleck playing Pitt, but MMC got it right. The sense of humor, the smile, the ruggedness, the womanizing are all here in all it's glorious cheesiness. Zahn, while looking nothing like my mental picture of Al plays it right. The chemistry between the two of them, which is arguably the most important part of the books, is translated extraordinarily well. Really the only character that's fumbled is Rudi, and if that's the worst transgression, I can live with that.The story remains surprisingly intact. Sure, some details have changed, but that happens in every adaptation (James Bond anyone?). Again, the spirit of the story is there. The cinematography and scenery are stunning. The movie just looks good. I found myself grinning along with the characters and marveling at the same things they were.For Dr. Cussler and those who are boycotting this film, all I can say is, ""Lighten up."". No one is going to sit through a 6 hour word-for-word film of the book. We're talking about an above-average airport book that is the equivalent of a serial from the 20s or 30s.

A lot of fun and action, great soundtrack and effects, good storyline that I could easily follow, and excellent casting (especially William H. Macy).

Sahara was an absolute joy from beginning to end. For me, the action, adventure, and lightheartedness of Sahara immediately brought back found memory of the Indiana Jones trilogy. It has been quite a while since I've seen an action movie with imagination and adventure that managed not to take itself too seriously. And that, I believe, is the key to Sahara! By avoiding the drama and seriousness exhibited by so many recent action flicks it endears itself to the viewer and makes unbelievable characters and situations much more palatable.

229,dyneshv,Indiana Jones v2005,7,18 July 2005,"Matthew McConaughey stars as the new century's version of Indiana Jones in Sahara, adapted from Clive Cussler's novel. McConaughey plays Dirk Pitt, the intrepid explorer and treasure hunter who works for NUMA and loves to get himself into trouble. With Steve Zahn for a sidekick and cigar smoking ex-admiral William H Macy for a boss, it has to be understood that the movie does not take itself seriously. Throw in Penelope Cruz as a WHO Doctor and you've got an afternoon treat where you check your brains at the door and bring lots of popcorn.But then again, Sahara is billed as a Adventure film, and as long as you're in the right frame of mind, it is very enjoyable. Dirk Pitt travels to Africa in search of a lost Confederate Ship. The sheer implausibility of the plot - A Confederate Ship travelling up the Niger River with some hidden treasure - is something you just have to ignore as Pitt and Co try and outwit a devious warlord in Mali (Lennie James) and a corrupt foreign businessman (played with ice-cool panache by Lambert Wilson) as they try and help the good Doctor (Cruz) try and stop an epidemic whilst also searching for their Ship. All in all, Sahara is meant to be a family movie, considering it was made by Disney. For the kind of genre it claims to be a part of, Sahara is quite good, but there is no doubt that if and when IJ4 comes along, Sahara will pale in comparison. For a fun afternoon at the cinema and a bunch of enjoyable clichés, I'd give it 7 on 10.",Sahara

234,tvman-3,"Not bad, but not outstanding, either",7,6 September 2005,"Cussler's novels have so many great action set pieces, that to whittle any of them down to a feature film immediately guts them of much of their fun. They would be better served in either a mini-series format or as a series a la ""Alias"" or ""24,"" where there are strong story arcs and lots of cliffhangers.It's unfortunate that the producers attempted to launch a film series with what is the most flawed of the Dirk Pitt novels. In fact, to their credit, some changes from the book actually do a better job of tying the historical backdrop to the contemporary story, and another edit makes somewhat more palatable the deus ex machina that saves Dirk and Al in the desert (the excised footage is included in the DVD's deleted scenes).The casting isn't bad, although Al Giordino is described in the Cussler novels as being more like Monk from the Doc Savage pulps than any run-of-the-mill actor. Casting would inevitably be a challenge (though I've long envisioned Joe Piscopo as the closest ""name"" actor to the character), but Steve Zahn certainly doesn't match the literary version of Al. Still, I understand that Cussler signed off on him, and he always adds a fun presence to the pictures he appears in. As for Rudi Gunn, I've always imagined him to be smaller, maybe a bit like Barry Livingston (Ernie on ""My Three Sons"") or even actor Matt Craven. William H. Macy doesn't make a bad Sandecker, though he certainly gives the character more of a comical bent than he has in the novels.All in all, the picture works on a very basic action-adventure level, but because of the scaling down required for the feature-length format, what we're left with is simply a decent action picture that's nothing special. Nevertheless, it certainly outperforms the one prior attempt to bring Dirk Pitt to the screen, ""Raise the Titanic""; which, for all its failings, gave us a wonderful score by composer John Barry.",Sahara

Well, I felt that way about Sahara. I understand that as a student of the film industry, I could forgive most of the issues that filmmakers face during the production process. However, about every three or so years, I find that I come across a current film that makes me sick to my stomach, and I find it difficult to forgive that. Especially when the son of Micheal Eisner, Breck, who directed the film, is dealing with so much material. I am especially disappointed with the fact that the main characters, as part of the plot, travel to Africa to remedy some disease that is killing the natives, and is found in the water they drink. First of all, what does this plot point have to do with the search for the treasure? Secondly, everyone in the world knows that the disease killing people all over the globe is AIDS. Not to sound preachy, but what business do the filmmakers have putting into the plot some made up disease for the African natives. Well, I am about finished with this review.

239,david-1230,Really Quite Dreadful.,1,15 June 2006,"I have had the utter displeasure of watching this film twice. Once on a flight from Auckland to LA and again when my wife decided to get it out at the video store without knowing id seen it and disliked it with a deep, unsentimental passion - it was a cold, white hate. Anyway, I thought id watch it again just in case my inability to actually follow the plot, my annoyance at the completely jerk-off qualities of Matthew McConaughey's character acting, Steve Zahn's brutally annoying one liners, the cracker box direction and the moronically offensive portrayal of Africans as either noble mystical creatures or cold blooded killers with brains the size of small yams had something to do with the sleeping pills, hangover, the dreadful sound found on the Qantus inflight entertainment system or the food (which i remember quite enjoying - but you never know). Turns out my first impressions were completely adequate; the film is rotten. Rotten beyond compare. There seemingly is no plot - or if there is, it isn't communicated via dialogue, cinematography or any other form of signifying system - just a whole lot of stupid coincidences without the luxury of serendipity. Hence, my wife turned to me as the sleazy McConaughey and dopey Zahn were attacked by monolithic Nigerians on the Niger for no reasonable explanation (except perhaps they where bloodthirsty savages in military uniforms?) and said: ""This makes no sense. Can you explain what is happening?"" I said no. I could not help my darling out - despite having viewed this scene twice i could not for the life of me understand why they were attacked or for that matter the motivation for any of their actions from then on in the film. We kept watching for no better reason than it was comfy on the couch and i couldn't bring myself to move wife's head from the my lap as she was soon fast asleep and in a way better place than I. She was a lucky woman. So: Don't watch this film. Starve the director of any respect, destroy his career and starve his children 'til he is forced to give up the ridiculous notion that he might have any talent whatsoever and force him to work in a crappy video store where he will be destined to live a lonely life hoping that someone will one day make him smile by renting his horrible film.

240,rainynight65,Highly disappointing,3,8 September 2005,"I was actually looking forward to this movie. Then I heard Clive Cussler was going to sue the makers because they changed the story too much. Then I read the first viewer comments and decided to skip the theatre and wait for the DVD instead. Now I have watched it, and it could hardly have been worse.As someone who has read nearly all Clive Cussler books (except for the new Oregon Files series and the non-fiction books), it almost hurts to see what kind of actors were cast to portray Cussler's highly detailed characters. McConaughey is barely acceptable as Dirk Pitt: Pitt is a man who has been around the world, not an all brawn no brain Yankee. But it gets worse: the movie's Al Giordino is a childish red-haired man, not the sturdy Italian he is described at in the books. And Rudi Gunn is shown as a pudgy geek who has never been out of his office before and doesn't know one end of a gun from the other. It was almost a relief to see William Macy as Admiral Sandecker, although he doesn't come close to his book equivalent. But what on earth got Penelope Cruz a role in this movie? She lacks everything she would need for this role - style, charm and charisma, not to mention a credible accent. If you need a good looking and charming Latino woman for a role like this - get Salma Hayek, or even better, Morena Baccarin.The movie plot is full of holes, important parts have been completely left out or heavily shortened. My wife didn't read the book beforehand and said the whole movie made no sense to her. Didn't make that much sense to me either. Pitt and Giordino take on a whole army by themselves, with nothing but a 150 year old cannon? Even Cussler, who sometimes goes slightly over the top, would never have put something like that into his book. Generally it seems to me that the screenwriters rolled the dice to determine which parts of the book would make it into the film. It all is topped with an inconsistent and more than once inappropriate choice of cutting techniques and musical score.This is a classic case of a movie leaving all audiences unsatisfied. The Cussler fans will probably by now have pledged eternal feud against Breck Eisner and his screenwriters, while people who didn't read the book most likely walked out of the theatre with a big question mark on their forehead. Let's hope that if there is another attempt to adapt a Cussler novel, it will be done by people who know what they are doing.",Sahara

I thought Penelope Cruz was severely lacking in either a good role in the film or perhaps she just isn't that good an actress (the latter methinks). McConnaughy was fine eye candy and seemed to carry the film, but then I reckon that was an enthusiasm tied quite tightly to the fact he was co-producer and this was a big adventure for him anyway. Steve Zahn, man what a disappointment, those jokes were lame! I couldn't quite pinpoint if it was the quips themselves or the delivery, but every time I expected a little chuckle to add to the excitement I was left horribly devoid of any emotion. The plot was OK if a little hammy and far-fetched - saving the world (ie America) from a nuclear waste leak produced in the African desert whilst searching for a civil war ship loaded with gold??

243,badrash9284,Better than expected,7,23 October 2005,"As the star of the film, McConaughey makes good in a role that should set him up with as much of a future as Raiders Of The Lost Ark did for Harrison Ford or The Bourne Identity did for Matt Damon. Unlike Damon, however, McConaughey looks to be playing it as much for laughs as for thrills and never loses sight of how much enjoyably daft excitement there is to be had from the film. The main plot - the finding of a battleship in the middle of the Sahara - is simply a story on which is hung all manner of action sequences, including a fistfight on top of a solar power plant, a race across the desert on an airplane-cum-landsailer and a climactic battle with cannons and a tank battalion. Each of these would be exciting were they in separate films but, together, they make Sahara great fun. Elsewhere, Zahn plays off McConaughey without ever vying for the lead role but Cruz is a distracting presence. I have no problem with a female member of the main cast - Eva Rojas balances the Dirk Pitt/Al Giordino balls'n'boffins combo - but Cruz is neither a good actress nor attractive enough and her reading of the medical notes carries as much authority as would an appearance by Jordan in ER.Finally, what Sahara does very, very well is to make a fine case for not ever wanting to go to west Africa, Like a Mondo Africa but with higher ambitions and a story linking the outrages, Sahara would have you believe that everything you'd ever heard about Africa occurred on a daily basis and that Mali, a real country that borders Algeria, Cote d'Ivoire and Senegal amongst others, is a hotbed of violence against all but the slipperiest of westerners. Odd then that the BBC website concludes that, "" Mali remains relatively peaceful."" In the end, Sahara feels oddly out of time, not only in its portrayal of a Mali some twenty years out of date but in having McConaughey playing Dirk Pitt as a contemporary of Indiana Jones, Matthew Quigley, Frank Buck and Tales of the Gold Monkey's Jake Cutter, rather than the more troubled Jason Bourne. If you're in the mood for a film that makes you feel smarter than you are but dumber too, for enjoying it, then you will welcome Sahara like a Bond on a Bank Holiday afternoon.",Sahara
244,WiltonR-M,lets go desert dancing!,6,25 March 2006,"So many people have said that this movie was not worth two cents, and in some ways i totally agree with them! although, i thoroughly enjoyed this movie, its plot made considerable sense and the action was good.Humour was used in the right places and i strongly believe that the casting was fantastic...except for Penelope Cruze, She is so bland! i cant stand her in this role, why not get someone extremely hot to play the part, maybe Rachel Bilson? ha..ha...The ending, of course is a good one, i might have liked to see more about the iron clad boat, the whole disease thing kinda stole the show away, if it was less about the disease and more about the gold etc...then this movie would have been at least a 8/10 The only thing that made me want to vomit while watching this movie was the cliché female voice of the facility where they were housing the chemical waste, i mean come on! leave that for Austin Powers!!",Sahara
245,jedidp,Damn good fun,8,8 September 2005,"The chemistry between the leads in this movie is terrific and it is every bit as good as any Indy or Mummy movie. Light years better then most of the drivel out there these days. This is just a fun movie with some great one liners and a terrific supporting cast as well. Sure it's implausible a time or two, what adventure/fantasy movie is not?, but it's got great pace and tells a big story quite well. There's even moments of political and social comment cloaked in humor. McCaunahey and Zahn do what they do best here and it shows. Yes, Cruz can be impossible to understand at times but she is not baggage and gets well into the fray. William Macy as usual is terrific as are the villains. Just a darn good adventure romp.",Sahara
246,slider-9,If you're a Cussler fan avoid like the plague! - MAY CONTAIN SPOILER,1,28 September 2006,"I'm a Cussler fan and have been for many years, so when I heard that this was in production I looked forward to seeing it when all the kinks were ironed out.After watching this, I actually reread the book again and realised that the film only deals with about twenty pages in the book and at that it comes nowhere close to even keeping with the spirit of the Dirk Pitt books.In the film, Dirk works for the NUMA and is portrayed reasonably well by Matthew McConnaughey, but his character is more of a playboy treasure hunter than a troubleshooter (In the book his official title is Special Projects Director, later head of NUMA), whose life's goal is to solve the mystery of missing Confederate Gold. In the book, the reason that he is in Africa is first a research project in Egypt and then an environmental project to trace the source of mysterious pollution.Steve Zahn does Al Giordino very well, however he doesn't look Italian nor does he even come close to stocky, although he does manage to get an element of Giordino's 'never-say-die' determination and a portion of the humour (his conversation with himself at the café was quite good) The character of Rudi Gunn was downgraded from his senior and serious position in NUMA to that of comic sidekick. He spends much of his time on screen whining about the behaviour of Dirk and Al, rather than being an integral part of the team.Granted the book is quite complex and to make a decent job of it on film would probably require something along the lines of a ""Gone with the Wind"" epic, but that doesn't excuse the poor job done with what we got. I know it's alway impossible to get the full flavour of a story, particularly when it's a book like Sahara, onto the screen, however this doesn't excuse cutting 95% of the story out.There were good points to the film, however they were few and far between. That's not to say it was a complete disaster, just that for a Cussler fan it was a major disappointment.",Sahara
247,Moonlit_Knight,Dirk Pitt is finally back!!!,9,8 April 2005,"If you've read any of the Dirk Pitt novels, then you know you're in for a wild, if sometimes preposterous, ride. This movie has all the Dirk Pitt trademarks, Historical Intrigue, Humor, Action and Classic Automobiles. It has the famous Dirk Pitt moment where he gets himself out of a sticky situation through sheer luck and preposterous circumstance. This movie is no more or less preposterous that most of the James Bond flicks. Go and have a good time at the movies.None of the actors were ones I pictured for the roles, especially Steve Zahn as Al Giordino, but in this movie they all worked out extremely well. Divest yourself of any preconceived notions about the characters and you'll enjoy the ride. I wish we could have seen more of some other characters in the movie such as Delroy Lindo as a CIA agent.",Sahara

This movie is what it is, a ""Very Enternaining actioned filled movie""Yes, yes, many aspects of the movie were unrealistic, but like my wife said, ""I don't go to the movies to see reality, I have enough of that in my daily life"" ! LOLThis ""break from reality"" is action filled and very entertaining, but with a slow beginning. Worth seeing in the theater.I am glad I did not listen to all the negative reviews, we almost did not go see it, but we are glad we did ! Fun to see, worth the price of admission.",Sahara
249,vash_da_stampeed,not worth sneaking into,3,8 April 2005,"now maybe i'm being a little too harsh when i write this, but the showing i saw last night at the theatre at which i work, bored me to death. the director seemed very confused as to what he was trying to prove. but we'll get to that in a minute...first let's discuss the top-notch acting. McConaughey trying to pull off the role of the hero was one of the weakest attempts i've ever seen. it wasn't that his acting is bad - he is a good actor - but as stated, i don't think the director knew what he wanted to do with the character. even the hilarious Steve Zahn can't save this film. his comic relief, while slightly amusing, missed it's mark. and Cruz....i'm not even gonna touch that...the director really didn't know what he was doing with this. all the chase and action scenes were confusing and slightly nonlinear. not to mention extremely unrealistic. now, i understand that movies such as this are supposed to be entertaining through fictional circumstances. but this goes way out of line. Steve Zahn's accuracy with an AK is uncanny and just not believable at all. all together, this movie had potential to be like National Treasure, or better. but the poor editing and directing ruined it for everyone. Favorite part: the scene at the beach with the antique car, look carefully....there are no tire tracks behind or in front of the car!! this is actually smart, i wouldn't want to drive such a nice car on the beach either, but they could've at least faked some tracks.blah, if you have some spare time, go for it. but don't say i didn't warn you.",Sahara
250,greengator,The book was better!,5,10 April 2005,"As a fan of Clive Cussler's novels, I had been looking forward to this movie for some time. I knew to expect far-fetched plots with Dirk Pitt and company saving the world by the end of the story, but for some reason, this plot adaptation seemed disjointed and hurried. Perhaps the biggest disappointment, though, was in casting a bunch of younger actors who did not portray the worldliness and experience of Dirk and Al very well. As any Cussler fan knows, the author makes a cameo in each of his books and I spent the whole two hours looking for his movie cameo. Didn't see it but I did note his daughter had a small role. Was it worth the price of admission - just barely.",Sahara
251,dascottishterrier,Good action film BUT...................,7,30 April 2005,"Sahara is a good action film. It doesn't have Oscar worthy performances or an intricate plot but it has big explosions which are entertaining and witty lines which, most of the time, raise a smile. I'd give the movie a 7/10.BUT As a fan of Clive Cusslar's books I was very disappointed by this film. And before you ask, yes I am going to have a rant about how this movie is doesn't live up to the book.First off, the casting ranges from spot on, Penelope Cruz as Eva Rojas, to down right awful, Steve Zahn as Al Giordano, but I'll complain more about this later. Matthew McConughey as Dirk Pitt is pretty good although not perfect, but it could have been a lot worse, cough, Ben Affleck, Cough. William H Macy as Admiral Sandecker works better than I thought it would although he would have been better as Rudi Gunn.The Main problem, however is how they changed so much of the best parts of the book. Al and Rudi are turned into comic relief so while they work in the movie they are just abominations to fans of the books. But worst of all they removed the final battle scene from the abandoned fort next to the mine, which is in my opinion the greatest part of any Clive Cusslar book. Not that they could have made it work that well because their was no mine and no UN task force for Pitt to fight alongside. I'd give the adaptation of the book a 2/10.I'm not saying that the film doesn't work. What I am saying is that, as a fan of the book I was really disappointed about all the changes made to a great story. Overall I gave this film 7/10 because it is a good action film, but if only they hadn't felt the need to change everything, it could have been a great one. 7/10.",Sahara
252,sbk_thespian,This movie didn't know where it was going,5,23 April 2005,"Sahara's advertising campaign did an excellent job of making this movie look great, but the movie didn't live up to its reputation. It appeared to be an Indiana Jones-type-movie but for modern times, resembling National Treasure very closely but taking place in Africa. This movie could have gone in many different directions, any one of them being good, but Sahara seems as if the producers tried to please everybody. Steve Zahn did an excellent, hilarious job at his part, but he seemed like he was in the wrong movie and wasn't very significant. The rest of the cast which did belong acted out their roles with either too much or to little effort, and put very little if any emotion into it. There was no character development whatsoever. It was a tad confusing, because in the two hours that the movie lasts, there are about 2 and a half plots that only have one thing in common: they take place in Africa. This movie was to unrealistic to be a good action movie, not emotional enough to be a drama, and not funny enough to be a good comedy. What happened to the movies?!?!?!?!",Sahara

It's an excellent Saturday Matinée thriller-adventure.With it, McConaughey, Cruz and Zahn launch a series on par with Raiders of the Lost Ark and the James Bond franchise. Sahara is Dirk Pitt's ""Dr. No"" . . . Harrison Ford's Raiders . . . Dirk (MM) and Giordano (SZ) avert danger and get the job done having fun every step of the way! Neither a Matthew McConaughey nor a Penélope Cruz fan had I been prior to Sahara. I thought MM personally took the movie CONTACT down a notch or two with his 'religious right' miscast to Jody Foster's scientist. Cruz . . . eye candy allure aside, I'd (mis)judged her acting ability to be substandard. Now: A big fan of both am I (thank you Yoda).In the dialogue arena, Steve Zahn's ""Lou Costello"" to Dirk Pitt's Abbott rocks. He's been the class clown ever since playing lead guitar in Hanks' THAT THING YOU DO. He does it well  especially in this film.The supporting cast - Top notch.And so begins the Dirk Pitt (Clive Cussler) film franchise Let the fun begin. 8 out of 10!

254,Loudmouth42069,"Some Parts Unbelievable in reality, but overall a good comedy/action flick",8,31 October 2005,"Well I just finished watching the movie, and I must say it was a pretty good one overall. A few of the parts of the movie made me wonder about the believability of some scenes as far as reality goes. The usual a movie does to you, such as how the hell did they escape that or there's no way they could have survived that. Stuff like that. But Steve Zahn really played his part to a tee and made the movie pretty funny throughout the whole movie. He really added a good addition to the action flick as far comedy mixed in goes. But overall, a pretty decent action flick with frequent comedy thrown in here and there by Steve Zahn. Below are my pros and cons of the movie: Pros - Funny interaction between Steve Zahn and Matthew McConaughey and with Steve Zahn alone as well.Good action all throughout the movie. Never really a dull moment.Cons - Sometimes unrealistic as far as escapes or surviving shootouts.So overall, I would recommend this movie regardless some of the escapes and whatnot are unrealistic. After all, it's a movie right? lol But that's just me.",Sahara

It is an excellent adaptation from the original novel. It is fast-paced and filled with banter just as the books are. Dirk Pitt, Al Giordino, Admiral Sandecker and Eva Rojas are all faithful to the original characters, as are Yves Massarde and Zateb Kazim. The plot remains essentially unchanged with only minor alterations to keep the movie moving quickly.I am duly impressed, and hope to see the three main actors re-appear in the next Dirk Pitt flick!",Sahara

I was in a simple word, fun. My only complaint was the open titles reminded me too much of Gone in 60 Seconds. Cruz is a hottie, Zahn is funny, and McConaughey is the token hero. Was it a bit formulaic? Yeah, but so what, everything is. And when it isn't it becomes that way when everyone else starts to do that...ie Matrix.If you liked National Treasure, you should like this. The story is a bit more realistic, even if some of the stunts aren't. Its still a fun movie. Please, go see it, and enjoy.",Sahara

The other thing i loved about it was that it didn't have hardly any bad language in it at all. So all in all it was a really clean, funny, and action packed film that was wonderful to watch. I would say it was as about as good as national treasure...which also was a fabulous movie as well. They both had good action and comedy in them.

Even if it's an Indiana Jones kind of movie with a more childish script, I can't say this is a bad product. First of all people can know more about an almost unknown country as Mali (even if now is a democracy and the picture shows us as a dictatorship), secondly it shows Africa as an energetic continent but forgotten by the World and lastly it's an environmental and not shallow movie all insert in a package of an action pop corn Hollywood movie. Certainly Indiana Jones its far superior but this is not rubbish and the characters are sympathetic specially the Admiral with an always great W.H.Macy. However I think the chemistry between McConaughey and Cruz started after the shooting because in the movie shines for his absence, but finally Cruz has a good excuse for her dreadful accent.",Sahara

And no potty humor!! I give this one an Academy Award for pure entertainment value and a fast moving plot with no wasted space. The acting/directing was smooth, the jokes were funny, the costuming was perfect, the camera angles were extremely artistic, and the old-fashioned bravery and perseverance's of Our Heros was downright inspiring.

Hey, and what a great time to screen such a movie given the current world political situation. I would like to say that there may have been a better way to have produced the movie but I'm not sure how. There seems to be some underlying faith in loads of really loadmouthed kickass people who can handle a gun and can take on the rest of the world - and win...this wasn't fun this was politics at its most base level. Was there a plot - oh yes the tin boat... um....and the toxic waste of course wow and the rest of the world being totally stupid...sorry...nearly forgot that bit.

263,jvegh,"7/10 as a movie, 4/10 as a book adaptation",7,5 April 2005,"I just saw Sahara tonight at an early screening. Overall I thought it was an enjoyable action flick, and would probably recommend it to anyone looking to have a fun time at the movies. However, having been a Clive Cussler fan for a number of years now, I was really disappointed at what this film could have been: a much better adaptation of its source material. I realize that some things had to be cut from the rather lengthy novel (the film is already 2 hours long, but it's missing around 100-150 pages of subplot that I really enjoyed in the book), but i feel that the elements present in the book could have been better represented. Also, while I enjoyed Steve Zahn's performance for what it was, he simply did not live up to the picture of Al Giordino that I've always had in my head. I've never been a huge Matthew McConaughey fan, but I actually feel he did a decent job living up to the legacy that is Dirk Pitt. Rainn Wilson and William H. Macy I thought were right on the money, though, in their portrayals of Sandecker and Gunn, respectively.So, in conclusion...To the Dirk Pitt fans: if you can purge your memory of the details of the Sahara novel, and maybe lose any rigid expectations of what these characters should look like/how they should act, you may have an overall enjoyable time with a hint of melancholy...For everyone else: Sahara has bit of everything...action, romance, an interesting plot, and plenty of comic relief, and is well above the norm among the recent action/buddy flicks to hit the screen.",Sahara

So the military mentality just have to get over it or not see action movies.If you read the book and expect the movie to be the same, don't go. Simple as that. There's no way they can be the same. The novel is different in each person's mind, and as there are over 6 billion of us here, it's ridiculous to expect such a result. Back in 1964 I saw Dr. No after reading all of the Bond books and Sean Connery was not my idea of Bond, but I loved the movie and went to see every one after that. I loved Sahara the movie even after reading the book. One person here said 'Too many plausibility issues for me to be truly sold into believing this plot. The characters keep having to explain the plot to you as the movie plays out. The plot at times is so complex the actors keep having to explain it to you numerous times throughout the movie.' How else can you get across 10 pages of explanation from the book? It happens in every movie made from a good book. If the bad guy doesn't tell us what's happening you would be complaining anyway, 'I didn't have a clue what was going on!' unless you read the book, because although it isn't exactly the same, it follows close enough for you to know what's happening. I've read a lot of books that were made into movies and this one was excellent. And speaking of plausibility, if you thought the film was unbelievable, it doesn't even touch on the most outrageous element of the book. Honest Abe Lincoln! Now you'll have to read the book to find out what that means! I hope to see MM and Dirk Pitt again, hopefully without Penelope!",Sahara

Shootings some view of Sahara's landscape and that's it. It's a pity it looked like a good action movie but it wasn't. There isn't anything to remember, there is no connection with the characters, it's a movie for public consumption. I guess most people felt the same,the movie was lower than their expectations.

267,huisid,A great adaptation of CLive Cussler's Dirk Pitt Saga,10,3 October 2005,"I really enjoyed Sahara. At first I was weary of the casting of Al and Dirk since I remember characters these actors played in other movies which weren't in line with the spirit of the novels. However they turned out absolutely perfect and it was great that they were approved by the author. The depiction of the characters and their relationships were excellent.The soundtrack of the movie was great as well. The first southern rock song that played made me laugh as if we were back in Dazed and Confused, however it soon seemed an appropriate, feel-good, counter balance to the wonderful African music. I feel that the African music accomplished a great deal in achieving the setting and was really moving during pensive or more emotional parts of the film.Although the movie didn't follow the novel precisely it captures the crazy adventure and unbelievable sequence of historical events which lead our heros to save the day again.I wonder if there could be more Dirk Pitt films. There are certainly several other excellent novels to choose from.",Sahara

Like any movie, it had it's slow parts but it was otherwise very watchable. The action scenes were good, held my attention and weren't too over the top like a lot of recent action movies. Each of the lead characters, a salvage diver and a doctor, had their own motivation for being there and they did a good job intertwining each of their adventures into one. Steve Zahn was hilarious. Matthew McC looked like he had been cram fake baking during filming but his body otherwise was very cut. Penelope Cruz is adorable as always. I LOVED the music.

So much left out, the only thing is this: Yes Zhan and MMC have chemistry - more than MMC and Cruz (who should take more acting lessons - GOD !!! where is Salma Hayek when you need her!!!!) Z and MMC did the buddy thing very well, not a stretch - they are real life friends - this is formulaic film making at its worst - Eisner should not have been trusted with home movies let alone a film that is supposed to be the first blockbuster of the summer. No, MMC is not a believable Pitt - again too much of the Texas Hippie attitude: during some tense scenes he appears to be on a steady lithium drip. Z is funny but no way is he Al - they should have just renamed the movie and the characters and THEN the film might have had a chance. I should have seen this coming when the only person promoting the film so far is MMC ON HIS OWN WITH NO STUDIO REP WITH HIM going to these screenings (usually looking like hell) and hocking the film himself passing out hats and t-shirts I know this is supposed to be like a 'grass roots' thing but it comes across as a ""white-trash-trailer-park"" tour.

Jeeps are rugged, sporty and undeniably sexy. I've often considered purchasing a Volvo or possibly an Acura, but this movie did exactly what it set out to do: showed me the errors of my ways: my next vehicle will be a Jeep or will not be at all! But don't take my word for it. On March 8th run to the nearest multiplex and shell out $10 of your hard-earned money and see this world-class advertisement for yourself. The only negative comment I have is, well, other Jeep commercials I've seen do have a better story, more interesting characters and memorable dialog, but forget about that. That's not what makes brilliant movies now. Jeeps do. And don't get me started about the Ray-Bans. I just bought 10 pair. That's right. It's also the most brilliant Ray-Ban commercial ever.

Macy was great as the admiral and the movie does a great job of depicting that all these guys are/were a team, without actually telling the ""dumb"" audience the line-for-line story.I really liked the opening sequence, though the music initially reminded me of Batman, until the action began. I also thought that movie was quite smart in the way they moved the story.The bad guys could have been a bit more diabolical and there was a lot of horse-riding about, a la Indy.

The woman wasn't some sexy tough girl who was determined to find a treasure but a doctor looking for the source of a plague.

I like nothing better then to put in a movie, get bored and fall asleep, but this movie had something up its sleeve.Every time I got my sleep on, something loud happened and woke me up. Now this really aggravated me. I mean, if you are going to make a sleeper movie, you have to commit. None of this quiet dialog, throw in a quick explosion to make sure everyone is awake and then more blah blah blah. I think there was even some nice Egyption music to sing me to sleep (or was that part of my dream?) I mean I would have liked to stay awake to look at Hayek or whatever her name was, but the blah blah blah-in was just too much.If I could have slept through the whole thing, I would have given it a 10, as the perfect sleeper, but it gets a point off for every pointless loud noise that woke me up.",Sahara

277,scholey,Where was the Entertainment?,3,9 April 2005,"I left the theatre wondering where the entertainment portion of this film went to; I will have to say I was truly bored with this misfire of a film. I usually love this adventure genre, bringing back memories of films I would watch as a child that I still enjoy repeat viewings of to this day. Unfortunately ""Sahara"" will be a film that will require channel switching if I happen upon it on TV. What a waste of time, I have a hard time understanding why Hollywood would spend so much on a budget and then have such a limp, unfunny, unexciting screenplay. The plot was uninteresting and silly, the characters uncharismatic and the action worthy of making a trip to the candy bar during. Oh well by paying to see such an embarrassing film I am only encouraging Hollywood to churn out more I guess.",Sahara
278,dsf1224,Adventure has a new destination. It should have stayed put.,6,11 April 2005,"Breck Eisner's ""Sahara"" is a film that makes no effort to hide its lofty ambitions. The tag line for the film proudly declares, ""Adventure has a new destination,"" which initially prompted me to wonder, ""Well where the heck has adventure been all these years?"" Then it hit me like a sack of bricks. The pistol, the whip, the fedora For the past two and a half decades, no other film has come even remotely close to the adventurous spirit of Spielberg's Indiana Jones. ""Sahara"" is no exception.Eisner's attempt to emulate the magic of the Indiana Jones films fails on three key levels that all involve major figures in the creative process. First and foremost, Breck Eisner is no Spielberg. My vision of him as the sniveling, opportunistic son of corporate shark Michael Eisner may be totally unfounded and slightly pretentious, but I'm willing to take that chance for two reasons: 1) the man was handed 130 million dollars to make a film with a highly unimpressive background directing a few TV movies, and 2) he's probably never going to read this, so I could theoretically say anything I want about him (I'm considering starting a rumor about his ambiguous sexual preference).The second key element missing from Eisner's Indy-imitation is Harrison Ford. Matthew McConaughey may be decent enough at flashing his pecks and punching guys' lights out, but he's got a lot to learn from the captain of the Millennium Falcon. Ford's role in his work goes much deeper than serving as a simple conduit for testosterone-inspired one-liners and flashy, hero-type grins; he captures the essence of the character with surprising precision  a perfect symbiosis of spot-on writing and quirky, interpretive performance. What makes the Indiana Jones character unique is that he often serves a dual role as both the hero and the comedic relief rolled into one (this can best be seen in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""). This complex combination of strength and awkward vulnerability is what made me love the character as a kid, and it's why I love him now. McConaughey's Dirk Pitt, however, must rely on his zany sidekick for chuckles, and while I regard Steve Zahn as a generally funny man, the two-dimensionality of both characters grows old quickly.The third and final irreplaceable component of Indiana Jones' triumvirate of awesomeness is writer George Lucas, who is best known for a little side project of his called Star Wars. While Lucas' talent as a director is debatable, the aforementioned duality he brings to the Indiana Jones character is absolutely essential to the success of the franchise. On the other hand, we have ""Sahara,"" whose producers are being sued by the author of the novel on which the film is based for severely altering the source material. I leave you with the following question to ponder: If the guy who thought of the whole thing thinks the movie stinks, then what hope have we?",Sahara
279,RDolny,A good blend of action and comedy,7,23 October 2005,"A movie easy to watch with good action sequences and just the right amount of comedy. This movie isn't pretending to be anything else than good clean flick entertainment blending the energy of 'Indiana Jones' with the charm of 'Romancing the Stone'.Penélope Cruz lacks credibility as a backwoods World Health Organization scientist/doctor, especially after seeing her in more sensual roles where she seems more comfortable such as in 'Vanilla Sky'. But that's OK - The movie isn't about her - it's about saving the world. Something Matthew McConaughey and his sidekick are doing very well and are entertaining us while doing it.",Sahara
280,nefretu,Excellent movie - great entertainment,10,7 April 2005,"I am not sure what all the fuss is about. I get really upset if 'stupid' people think that anything that gets adapted into a movie would be like the book. This is simply impossible. Anyone who reads the book Sahara or any other book for that matter has a different image of things. This is called imagination! Sure, there are characeristics of the characters that the author explains but the rest is up to imagination! So therefore there is no way that any movie could be as good as the book. I believe that this movie is great. It is funny, entertaining and a great way to spend two hours. Raise the Titatnic went by the book and look how awful that was!!! I am sure that many people would prefer other actors who in their mind would be better suited to the parts and that might be true but like I said, no one thinks alike and I think when it comes to watch a movie that is based on such a successful book, one needs to have an open mind. There are only so many things that can be adapted from the book and I think they did a splendid job. I hope they will continue this franchise with many more movies because they characters work together. They might not be 100% true to the book but for a translation to the movies, it is brilliant! Just great, so go out there, watch it with an open mind and simply enjoy it. Don't pick it to pieces because it is not exactly like the book or because you had imagined Dirk Pitt or Al differently. Just enjoy it for what it is.",Sahara
281,tatrue,"""Sahara"" the oasis of action",8,7 April 2005,"The movie contains very good action sequences and the story is very well thought out. The movie-goer is never surprised why this or that happens and nothing outrages happens with out it fitting the situation. The partnership between Dirk Pitt (Matthew McConaughey) and Al Giordano (Steve Zahn) as friends and partners is solid. I can see this partnership working in other movies or even in this set up if there is a sequel.Regardless the rest of the cast makes the story of a sea seeking treasure hunter work well. The working partnership with the ""Admiral"" James Sandecker (William H. Macy) with Dirk and Al is easily accepted and works on many level one being of deep respect of each other. They all know each other well including the weaknesses and strengths. When Dirk find an unexpected clue to his life long work of looking for the C.S.S. Texas, ""The Admiral"" and Al both know this is going no where and tell him so.But they have other missions more pressing and with a generous 72 hours Dirk and Al take a quick look into his dream find. Along the way Dr. Eva Rojas (Penelope Cruz) and her colleague from the World Health Organization (Glynn Turman) join in to take a trip into the heart of the desert. Soon the partnership is deep in Mali in the Sahara and finds that their cause have something in common. Not the best work of Cruz as she was better in ""Blow"" and ""Vanilla Sky."" But she did hold her own with a generally outstanding cast. The weak link in her is not the actors but the direction, which seemed to be very noticeable to me. However, Turman's performance was very outstanding. I was very surprised with the amount of development they gave him and he didn't disappoint a bit.The action gets more intense as War Lords, Sahara tribes and big corporations are stopping efforts of the pair at every turn. Some of the adventures get a bit tried at times. One of the last bit of actions sequences takes a bit of ""suspension of reality"" to accept. However, the movie redeems itself by the end with hope to leave on. The only thing that distracted from the overall look of the film was some of the direction took by new comer Breck Eisner, son of Michael Eisner. It was hard to understand some of the extreme camera angles and the over use of wide shots in some of the more intense parts. However, The look was good and most wouldn't notice the choices I would say. The music was unique and refreshing to see some of the sounds in a ""big screen"" production. Sahara makes for a good nights entertainment and brings with it the hope of more to come. Stand out performances include William H. Macy, who would made the picture better with more screen time, and the buddy chemistry of McConaughey and Zahn. Also the partner of Penelope Cruz was very good to have on the screen.",Sahara

283,yoshijosh57,Well worth a definite look,10,16 April 2005,"I had the opportunity to watch this film in the cinema today. At first I was a little reluctant to see it, but I am very glad I made the choice to see it. This is based on the Clive Cussler novel (Sahara), but unfortunately I don't know how well. I will get around to reading it.This film has everything: it is an adventure, with a lot of suspense moments where the goodies look like they're beat, and there is comedy. It makes everything for a good movie. The comedy is simply sly remarks, small jokes, nothing slapstick. As with all Clive Cussler novels, this film is all a bit over the top, with some of the situations physically impossible to re-enact in real life. But, you can't help but laugh at some of the ways Dirk (Matthew McConaughey) and Al (Steve Zahn) get themselves out of sticky situations.The storyline of the film is Dirk and his best mate Al trying to find an iron-clad ship used in the American Civil War. This is not a fake ship, but it was thought that ships of this type were actually used in the Civil War. Anyway, Dirk has reason to believe that one of those ships has somehow been beached in Africa, so he manages to convince Admiral Sandecker (William H. Macey) to borrow his boat to go up to Mali. Here the plot thickens and Dirk, Al and Eva (Penelope Cruz) find themselves in places varying from Solar Plants to (how ironic) the Sahara Desert! All in all, this is a maginificent film, with everything to make you laugh, watch in awe, and feel the suspense.10 / 10, well done.",Sahara
284,bigjohn_81,Fun Film,10,7 April 2005,"I am a huge Clive Cussler fan and while it doesn't follow the book 100 percent I still found this to be a highly enjoyable action/adventure film. I did not go in expecting academy awarding winning brilliance everywhere I looked like most 1st year film students do (I used to be one). I did however go in hoping for a good time, and a good time is what I got. The dialog/banter between Matt and Steve is amongst the best I have heard (This was what I was most apprehensive about, if they could not pull of the partnership between Matt and Steve I would probably have hated this film). This movie proves you don't need to swear to get laughs. I don't recall one of the major swear words in this film and I must say it is refreshing. That relationship is probably the most important point in this film in order to make it work. I believe they succeeded. The film was just great to watch. Great action, great locations and again the relationship between Matt and Steve (I bring this up again because it is one of the things I found to be great in the book). I have read pretty harsh criticism of this film and I must say it is unjust. At worst this film would probably rate a 4/10. I personally could not give a 1/10 unless it personally insulted me, was offensive, or the production values were just bad. This film had none of those traits. Bring on the sequel",Sahara
285,sergeantpinback80,"Despite its flaws, this movie could have started a great franchise.",8,20 January 2014,"Matthew McConaughey stars as NUMA treasure hunter Dirk Pitt. Dirk has been searching for the long-lost civil war ironclad battleship ""The Texas"". He believes ship managed to travel from the coast of Virginia all the way to the Niger River only to never be seen again. When Dirk and his partner Al go searching for the legendary ship they become entangled in a health scare when a W.H.O. doctor has found evidence of a plague that has been infecting people up and down the African coast. Together they must find out what is going on, stay a step ahead of a murderous warlord and find the ""Texas"" if it still exists.Regardless of this film's reputation, ""Sahara"" continues to be one my favorite all-time movies and one of my most frequently watched. I think McConaughey nailed the part of Dirk Pitt and Steve Zahn (who I don't usually like) nails the part of the wise-cracking side kick Al. Penelope Cruz is great as the W.H.O. doctor and unlike Denise Richards playing a nuclear specialist in ""The World Is Not Enough"" Cruz is believable in the role she is playing. The film has plenty of action, a lot of funny one-liners, and the movie never gets boring. It's a shame that things never could get worked out between author Clive Cussler and Paramount Pictures since the making of this movie because I think the movie did well enough that a franchise was definitely possible.

During the movie, Pitt and Giordino run across a crashed plane. In the book, this belonged to an Australian female pilot named Kitty Mannock. Supposedly, she was to have been played in the movie by Clive Cussler's daughter (Dayna?). This scene was apparently deleted, so that when Pitt & Giordino find her plane, they don't say anything about it at all (in the book, it is part of the plot). I would've thought that Pitt and friend would've searched through the plane and found Mannock's diary (which had info on the ""Texas"").Still, all in all, it was a good movie.",Sahara

Physically, Mcconaughey plays Dirk very well, but would have been perfect if just a little more complex and deep -- the ""real"" Dirk Pitt is more of a renaissance man. The beautiful Penelope Cruz IS the perfect Eva Rojas. Steve Zahn as Al Giordino was wonderful and funny, but he doesn't look Italian. William H.

289,mdfuk,"When I think of the Sahara desert I think dry, boring, predictable and death by dehydration. This film is exactly those things",2,9 June 2005,"The title for me basically writes its own review. When I think of the Sahara desert I think dry, boring, predictable and death by dehydration. This film is exactly those things the humour is dry and unfunny the plot is boring and predictable and I wished instead I was dying of dehydration than sitting in the cinema which doesn't happen often. The whole film was just pure action movie cheese and predictability that got so tedious towards the end. I cannot think of a film I have seen (besides Dodgeball) where from the start I could predict what was going to happen at the end and how exactly it was going to happen. The basic plot outline is that a dashing (poorly acted) explorer Dirk Pitt (Matthew Mconaughey) embarks on the greatest treasure hunt of his life looking for an American Civil War battleship that had found its way and been lost in the Sahara desert in West Africa (how the hell did an ironclad ship get to Africa) Pitt and his (shamefully unfunny) sidekick are assigned to help Dr Eva Rojos (Penelope Cruz) from the World Health Organization who is working in the same area and believes the same ship Pitt is hunting for could be the cause of mysterious deaths in the same area. I wonder if that you can guess what happens in the end? The action hero cheese really reeks throughout this film from the unfunny lines from Steve Zahn the sidekick to Mconaughey and the all too predictable final scenes between Cruz and Mconaughey. In a final scene described as ""epic"" inside the American war ship they manage to find all the old pieces to an American civil war cannon that is 150 years old and get it to fire through the windscreen of a Helicopter circling them from outside. That was the final straw for me I think.I didn't read any reviews of this film before going to see this film which I don't do very often but I was going at the last minute so had no time, I really wish I hadn't wasted my time and money. If you want a decent action film in this frame of mind watch the Indiana Jones series it has everything this film lacks.",Sahara

That actually makes it good. It is funny and it is fun how wrong this movie is in every single way. If I would have watched it in the cinema I would have demanded my money back but when you have a bit of time to spare and noting else to do it is definitely watchable as an action-comedy. Don't take it too seriously, don't try to discover a meaningful plot, don't rationalise any of the stunts. Sailing a plane through the dessert and stunts that contradict all laws of physics known to men.....that is what you'll get to see and the lighting is pleasant.

291,axelstewart,Honestly fantastic,9,23 December 2017,"I came away from this movie having enjoyed every minute of it, and it saddens me to see that other people who watched it didn't get the same experience out of it. To that point, I'll address a lot of the complaints I'm seeing.
I didn't expect it to be a work of art, and it wasn't a work of art. It was funny, quick-witted, and well-paced, with an interesting plot that got only somewhat predictable right at the end. The characters interacted realistically - not establishing great trust or romantic interest instantly, but instead bouncing off of each-other and coming back together organically.
I don't understand any of the complaints about the acting. I didn't feel that any of the characters were wooden or overdramatic at all. None of them blew me away, but there wasn't any juncture at which they seemed not to be reacting to a situation properly, and I thought that the leads were all charismatic.
The suspension of disbelief necessary for this movie is something that any moviegoer should be capable of for the sake of their own enjoyment of life's fleeting pleasures.
The plot was not at all difficult to follow. There are only a few twists, and they are well-explained. The film only resorts to characters explaining things when it is much more efficient than showing through fully visual storytelling.
I get that the representation of the African people in the movie was not entirely flattering, and for that, my estimation of the film is subdued somewhat. It's arguable that this is just the stupid henchman trope or heroic immunity, but I think it's a bit worse than that. Still, I would hesitate to call this racist or exploitative - just slightly thoughtless.I appreciated that all three of the main party were useful characters. The sidekick was not only competent and cool-headed, but also capable of solving problems creatively. Eva was legitimately not a helpless damsel - they didn't just give her one or two moments of usefulness, they allowed her to be a functional human being without the assistance of her male counterparts. The situations in which she failed were ones where she realistically should, and she was uncommonly brave and determined in the face of danger.I did not read the book, nor likely will I, but I loved the movie. It was far better than I expected, and I seldom enjoy a movie this much.
If you didn't like it, that's okay, but relax a bit before you watch your next movie because you deserve to enjoy something this good.",Sahara
292,agaga23,Did they just do what I think they did?,5,17 January 2006,"Sahara is an okay movie. It's got all the action movie basics. A corrupt corporation, a hot chick, heroes, guns, gadgets, a world wide threat and explosions. It also has all the action movie basic flaws. A one sided story, completely unrealistic gun scenes, mediocre actors and how could that ever work moments.Sahara starts off nicely. Treasure hunters need to find a boat and a doctor needs to figure out the cause of this mystery plague. They all get together and go on a wacky adventure. Whopee!. Apparently the plague isn't really a plague at all. A plant that specializes in disposing waste is the cause of the poisoned water supply. Oh no the heroes have to stop them from polluting the entire worlds water. Save the fishies.But after awhile the movie starts to show its nasty side. Throughout the whole movie the heroes are being shot at by dozens of armed soldiers and don't ever get hit. HOW?!?!?. Don't ask me I didn't write this piece. They escape countless situations where anyone would be shot. Not a single bad guy knows how to operate a gun. Anyway the movie is long. Not a good long. A long where there's lots of filler. LOTS OF IT. Another thing. How come the United States Government didn't seem to think a private army with tanks and helicopters wasn't a big problem? They must have known the soldiers can't hit the broadside of a barn.The absolute worst part of the movie was the end. The gang somehow knew that the boat they were looking for was in a hill they were just randomly driving by. Then they climbed into the boat. Which has been sitting in a sandy hill for a 150 years and use its cannon to shoot down a helicopter that was chasing them. WHAT? I couldn't believe my eyes. Did they just shoot down a helicopter with that old thing. I guess it's because one of the guys somehow figured out how to fire a cannon that old without it falling apart and hit a moving target half a mile away completely by sight and all in under a minute. COME ON!! Then out of no where a rebel army comes to their aid and with only ak's and horses they manage to get an army with tanks to surrender. I really don't think a horse beats a tank in any country. Whatever.In conclusion, terrible movie. Don't bother. Do not support this film.

Don't get me wrong it was a good movie. Looking from a reader's point of view... it stunk.Not so much the story but the characters where all wrong. Ms. Cruise was not the right person to play her character. She is too strong while the character in the book was more fragile and relied on Dirk for safety.Steve Zahn is the exact opposite of Al Giordino. Al is short with curly black hair, and is always dead serious. Steve is average height, blond straight spiky hair and seems to have no brain.Admiral Jim Sandecker was perfectly cast but Rudi Gunn was not. Here I will not go into detail so read the book.Dirk Pitt finally was cast well but I am disappointed in the writer in what he has done to him. In this movie that make Dirk to be a ego-tistic adventure seeker. In the brilliant Clive Cussler book his character is noble.

There were a couple of scenes which made me laugh in disbelief, but the film needed such stuff. Dirk Pitt, the resourceful adventurer always turns adversity into advantage and this film tried pretty well to depict that. Also, the dialog between Dirk & Al is good.

However, for all those Clive Cussler fans out there who have read the book, found it excellent, and were expecting anything close to it, this is a huge disappointment. The movie departs from the book in so many crucial ways, including the omission of major plot elements and changing the story and action in ways that are complete unrecognizable to the book. The Rudi Gunn in the movie is nothing like his character is portrayed in the novels, and Giordino's movie counterpart isn't superb either. I'm not saying it's a bad movie however.

I've been reading Clive Cussler novels for a while and I'm not sure that I would have chosen the cast that was picked for this film, but I can't say that I was let down by who they chose.

I pretty much predicted every scene this film had to offer as soon as I saw the TV spots. This brand of story has been done to death! Why bother putting such a redundant tale to celluloid. All one needs to do is watch Indiana Jones and you've already seen this film before you've watched a minute of it. I hope they don't make back their budget for this one...Matthew McConaughey and Steve Zahn were just filling in the old ""hard-bitten hero adventurer"" and ""goofy sidekick"" roles... Penélope Cruz, while often nice to look at is just a stock standard damsel in distress. Both the bad guys are totally forgettable.One thing I like to do while watching this kind of brain dead film is to guess whether it will all end with a big explosion. And yes, this one does.

The effects weren't even worth the effort to drag myself to the cinema.Congratulations Breck, I hope this piece of crap you made puts a smile on daddy's face. Now, can I have my 2 hours back?",Sahara
300,mansfield_satchmo,Surprisingly good!,9,5 April 2005,"Based on the commercials and reading the premise, the movie sounds like many of its type that came before and will follow: crapcrapcraptacular.However, I caught the LA premiere, and I must say, wow. I waited earnestly for horribly written dialogue (ala Aliens vs. Predator), looked carefully for awful chemistry, strained to see terrible plot elements. But, nothing glaring ever entered my field of vision.The flick is indeed reminiscent of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" Breck Eisner grew up in the Indiana Jones era, loved the films like every boy (and girl, even) his age, and had his dream realized: to direct an action adventure with treasure hunts and big explosions.The movie is way more clever than you'd expect. The humor is dry and hilarious. The action is rather gripping. The plot, well, even the plot is pretty tight. It IS a silly premise, chasing a ship from the civil war that made its way to Africa, and yet, it worked. I expected actual stupid ghost skeletons, or blatant sexism where Cruz was concerned. Quite the contrary, no unbelievable supernatural elements were ever introduced, and Cruz was a strong character, believable and likable. My favorite dynamic in the film was the Zahn-MacConaughey relationship. They really had brotherly chemistry and were utterly delightful to watch. William H. Macy was also hilarious in his deadpan way. I liked Cruz the least, but even so, she was hardly a weak link in the film's proverbial chain. She held her own quite well. But the boys were comedic gems.I adored the soundtrack as well. Homeboy (who also scored ""Requiem for a Dream"" I believe) knows what works and what doesn't. Desert scenes with CCR and the like were pretty funny. (Very suitable for the southern boyishness that MacConaughey exudes). For his first real big-budget film, I'd say Eisner has hit a home run.The film never takes itself too seriously. It never approaches the ""campy"" genre. (It is way better than ""The Mummy). It's simply a fun, crazy adventure. It's good entertainment and a pretty cool homage to the lost art of the adventure flick.By no means run to your nearest theater to see it; it's not ""Ray"" or ""Million Dollar Baby."" But, then again, it never tries to be. If you want a good time, check it out.",Sahara
301,patrick-292,"The characters are right, the story is not.",6,14 April 2005,"No movie will ever live up to the collective imagination of Dirk Pitt fans...so don't expect it to and you'll enjoy yourself a lot more when you watch the movie.The screenwriter's adaptation is tough to swallow compared to the story in the book. This is where a die-hard fan can feel real disappointment. I'm a fan, which is why my vote is lower. Otherwise, the movie is fun the same way Indiana Jones came across back in the 80s.McConnaughy and Macy do great jobs as Pitt & Sandecker respectively, and I hope they get the chance to play them again. The bad guys are also well cast.",Sahara
302,spamisgod,Highly Enjoyable,8,1 March 2005,"I just saw this movie at the Philadelphia screening, and I'm going to agree with the 8 star rating it has garnered so far. We all know the formula for this sort of movie, and yes, Sahara does follow the formula pretty closely, but it's enjoyable nonetheless.It's an action movie, if that wasn't entirely clear. Simply put, if you like action movies, see this movie. If you don't, don't. The film follows our hero  ex-marine treasure hunter Dirk Pitt  and his friends through Africa as they uncover evil plots, fight bad guys, and search for treasure. While there aren't any surprising twists in the plot, I do admit that it was not completely predictable. The plot has enough originality in it to keep you watching. True to it's genre, the plot delivers plenty of action. It's not to stylized (Matrix) or epic (Lord of the Rings) but it won't let you down. The ending is just about as slam-bang as you'd expect, I'm sure you'll enjoy it.Dirk Pitt is played by Matthew McConaughey, who happened to speak before the movie was shown. Apparently he'd been involved in the movie as more than just an actor  he is one of the executive producers, a role he takes seriously (he said he'd had the opportunity to produce other films but turned them down, not wanting to get involved in something unless he was really going to commit to actually working on it). McConaughey said that he'd been trying to get the role for seven years, and is quite pleased with the result. When asked if he planned to produce future movies, he gave a definitive ""yes"". He also hinted at the possibility of a sequel, if this movie does well, noting that there are sixteen more books by the author this script was based on.McConaughey plays Pitt well. It's a pretty standard action-hero role. McConaughey's performance isn't particularly ground-breaking, but he throws the punches and delivers the lines with appropriate demeanor. My only complaint would be that he is a little too cool at times, given the stressful situations... but then again this movie wasn't made for realism. Al Giordino is Dirk's more technically minded buddy and co-adventurer. They've been friends since kindergarten, how sweet. Oh and you guessed it. Al is our comic-relief guy. Al is played by Steve Zahn, who delivers the comic relief character in a manner slightly less cliché than I was expecting. It just works a little better because he really does come off naturally as Dirk's long time friend, as opposed to some wise-ass who's just here for the ride. The chemistry between McConaughey and Zahn is very effective, as the previous reviewer pointed out. They really do appear more as two guys trying to get something done as opposed a hero and a side-kick. Also worth mentioning is Rainn Wilson who plays Rudi. Rudi is basically another comic-relief guy who has much less screen time then Zahn, but Wilson did a nice job. William H. Macy plays the commander type character, Dirks boss. Not Macy's best job in my opinion, it was a bit stilted  but with some funny moments. Lambert Wilson, of Matrix fame (The Merovingian) stars as well. I was a little disappointed to see him early on in the film, cause it was one of those moments where I just knew that he was going to turn out to be a bad guy. He does pretty well, although he seems to be doing just a slightly toned-down version of the Merovingian here. Ah, and let's not forget Penélope Cruz. Our heroine, the W.H.O. doctor, does just fine in her role. One thing I have to say is that the inevitable hero / heroine romance is very effectively down-played. In fact, there really isn't too much romance in this film at all.On the technical end of things, Sahara does fine. There aren't too many overwhelming special effects, but the effects there are come off completely realistically. The movie is shot beautifully, although it seemed like the entire thing was shot with extremely long lenses. I was glad to have my depth perception back at the end of the movie. The vistas of Morocco are quite nice, and there are some nice scenes in modern day African cities and towns that pick up quite nicely on camera. I got excited when I saw Clint Mansell's name in the opening credits as the music composer (he brought us the fabulous Requiem for a Dream piece, probably my favorite soundtrack song). In the end, the music wasn't much to talk about. The orchestral pieces were pretty bland (sorry Clint), and there were occasional bits of popular music that I found to be out of place (the inclusion of ""Sweet Home Alabama"" is particularly offensive in this regard, it's been in so many soundtracks, it even has it's own movie). There is some quite decent African music which is enjoyable.The rating of PG-13 is appropriate. There is no nudity or anything, no serious profanities that I can remember, and the action is not gory or too bloody.All in all, it's a fun movie. If you need heart-rending drama and a complex psychological plot, than you will probably not agree with my 8 star rating. This movie isn't going to win any awards, and will not become a favorite of serious film aficionados, but if you want to go out to the theater on a Saturday night with a bunch of friends, this will be one movie you can all agree on.",Sahara
303,sherazshabir,Sahara V Phoenix?,6,12 May 2005,"Blinded by sand storms of action, with a political undercurrent, may lead the audience to think that this dune has some depth to it. It doesn't.Matthew McConaughey and Steve Zahn as Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino are a nice double act. Dirk, the action man with sex appeal, fronts the show, with Al as his shorter, funnier, geekier sidekick. This pairing makes up for the nature of the film, which puts action above all else.The opening scene takes us back to the end of the American Civil War. With cannon fire more explosive than the typical Jerry Bruckheimer movie, this is an electrifying, if historically inaccurate, introduction. From the very start, it's a popcorn adventure yarn, with the occasional extended dialogue exchange, which tries too hard to mean something - anything - when quite clearly it's as empty as a seashell.Whereas the action in Flight Of The Phoenix crashed and burned, Sahara has you on the edge of your seat. The gunfire is loud and rapid, the scenes tense because we care about Dirk and his buddy and even the superficial Eva Rojas (Penelope Cruz).Although the action is rugged and raw, Dirk and Al seem to be immortal. Thousands of bullets are fired at them and yet they remain unscathed. This decreases the suspense to a cynical degree and it's impossible not to want Al to take a bullet in the shoulder, or stomach, and have him close to death for a few minutes, just to instill a sense of humanity into the proceedings The political element adds intrigue but, ultimately, is secondary to the action. Dirk and Al are not interested in the cause that they fight for, and you can imagine that it is Eva who is doing all of the demonstrating on that campaign. Nonetheless, our hero does have a Captain Planet side to him and this leads us to sympathise with him a little more.The supporting cast are unenthusiastic about their performances, as well they might. McConaughey has the body for action movies, but is yet to find his stride. Dirk has none of the character flaws that make John McClane, or Indiana Jones, heroes. If Sahara makes money, Dirk will be back on the big screen again, hopefully with a drug addiction of some description to add another dimension to his bland good nature.This is Breck Eisner's second film. His first sunk without trace, but was enjoyable nonetheless. He has not yet laid claim to an identifiable technique that would set him apart from the crowd and seems to be riding on the wave of past films. There are some nice touches, however, such as the audience seeing Dirk beat off two bad guys entirely from the point of view of an injured Eva, but this does not last as Eisner succumbs to the urge of showing off his big budget.The script needs more character development and the film a touch of realism in order to add more tension to its action sequences. The brutality is arresting, but the disregard for human life contrasts unrealistically with Al's inability to die, just like a sidekick should.A fun ride, open and shut, Sahara is nothing more than it appears to be.",Sahara
304,hothead6400,"I really, really wanted to like this movie, but....",4,11 November 2005,"It seems that the comments here are quite polarized and this may be because there are people like me who have read the Cussler books, and those who have not. Us Cussler fans wouldn't easily recognize the story line of this movie as being based on a Cussler book, I'm sorry to say.The direction, the acting, and the production values were good. The problem was the screen play. It's not the same story. The book had a surprise ending which was completely ignored in the movie. It's tough enough to adapt a book to film, so the least they should have done is a bit more research to learn the real appeal of Cussler's stories. They're not profound, but they're not only about heroes beating up bad guys either. All the fun of a Cussler story is lost on this movie.Now I know this might annoy some people, including Mr. Cussler himself, but I would suggest Mathew and Company, go back and try another one but this time stick more to the original story... Look at it this way, Tom Clancy books have had rather outlandish plots too that have still made it to film. Surely a Cussler story isn't that much of a leap by comparison.",Sahara
305,crystal_cvngtn,"Good, clean fun",7,6 April 2005,"Went to a screening last night and found the movie to be quite enjoyable. I have read most of the Dirk Pitt novels and was immediately put off by the casting when it was announced because the leads are too young for the roles as written. Obviously I had to let that go to enjoy the movie at all. The crucial thing is this: all of Cussler's books are cliché-ridden, over the top, Dirk can do any and everything B-grade fluff. Perfect beach reading (in my opinion). Therefore any movie based on the characters would likely be all these things too - and it is. It is not a ""serious"" action movie - it's just supposed to be entertaining.I find Matthew charming and I think that helped. I also think Steve Zahn is hilarious. Yes, he plays the same role over and over but it's a funny role so I don't mind. Zahn's facial expressions alone are worth a matinée admission I think. Penelope Cruz usually bugs me but she didn't in Sahara, and that's saying a lot my friends. I didn't notice the Jeeps is some kind of obvious way - they're explorers in the desert....Jeeps would seem a natural fit. BTW - the locations are really beautiful.",Sahara
306,poulosm,Cussler Rules!!,10,11 April 2005,I'm a recent convert to Clive Cussler the author and was skeptical to how Sahara would translate to the big screen. From the minute the movie started it was >insert great cliché here<. (roller coaster thrill rideetc.) I thoroughly enjoyed all aspects of this film and was pleasantly surprised with the musical score/soundtrack. Breck Eisner has done a masterful job of keeping things fast paced but still giving us enough meat to make the plot seem plausible. Matthew McConaughey worked well as the Dirk Pitt and Steve Zahn ended up being a great Al Giordino. Penelope Cruz seemed credible as a world heath organization official. I also loved the evil Frenchman's character played by Lambert Wilson (the same guy from the Matrix movie). I'm not sure who was responsible for the movie's overall plot and who decided to change the past experience of the main characters but it really does work better for me than the books. When you see Dirk and Al kicking major league butt it make's more since in the movie than in the books because they have different military experience. Without giving anything away I loved the ending and the set up for future films. This movie proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that Cussler is perfect for the Big Screen!!!,Sahara
307,mdorganicdancer,Worth no more than 3.25,3,5 May 2005,"I am sorely disappointed in this film, I feel that I have paid more for the breath taking shots of the sea and/or the loss of the sporting boat (budgets are budgets), and these shots ended early in the movie. For those into male physic's this movie is for you, if Matthew is your guy. And the chick isn't bad either, but as characters, there could have been more conflict between the two to establish his rebellious streak and her nature of ""progress and method"". But when the idolized ship is found rather ""accidently"", (and one knew this was coming in the movie)all while escaping the menacing evil, and of course it's even more super predictable ending has the heroine and his lass defeating the attacker with such said ship, it is incredibly trite and insults the movie goer. I rate in dollar amounts...it's worth 3.25, but no more than 3.75. See it in the afternoon when it's cheaper. Movies I can compare this to are...Cheaper By the dozen (Comedy but predictable), Sonic Impact (Although a bit better for the simple fact there are more characters and not just a couple.)",Sahara
308,Beatleboy-3,A great mix of adventure and comedy,10,11 September 2005,"This film contains a great mix of adventure and comedy. It easily can be called a modern day Hope and Crosby ""Road"" picture. Yes, some of the events that occur are somewhat unbelievable, but if you put that aside and just accept things at face value, the film works. What do you want? It's Hollywood make-believe. I can see Matthew McConaughey as the Bing Crosby type straight man to Steve Zahn's comic relief a la Bob Hope. They did everything short of a ""patty-cake"" routine to foil the bad guys. Even Penelope Cruz's role can be equated with the Dorothy Lamour type character, except that Cruz is more than just eye candy. Her character really adds to moving the overall plot of the picture forward. I recommend this film to all ""Road"" picture enthusiasts even more so than ""Spies Like Us"" which should have been Hope and Crosby's last real ""Road"" picture until Bing Crosby died just before filming began.",Sahara

As disease and politics plague our ""real world"" the writer of this has found away to bring our fantasy to our reality.Yes it is only a movie and yes the only down side of the flick is the name Penelope Cruz as the leading lady. She does however play the part exceptionally well, and once you get over the fact that you are watching her you actually will begin to enjoy the film.If you are after spine tingling, muscle flexing from the none other Matthew McConaughey then girls this is the one for you. His voice is to die for with the sex appeal dripping from his mouth as he sweats it out in the desert- jumping from camels, to cars, to boats, to trains.This is the action of the season and one you'll regret it if you miss it.",Sahara

I wish there were more films like this that lack the need for explicit sex, violence, drugs or swearing to get noticed. I believe strongly in movies that contain the aforementioned elements and are for adults; it's just sad to see few family films that don't involve animated cookie-cutter characters. Nice jobs by both Zahn and Cruz. The supporting characters were likable and not too cliché. Admittedly Zahn has fallen into a role of the crazy side-kick, but in this film I think he finally finds the balance of kooky and serious in the way a action movie ""buddy"" should.",Sahara

The lead characters played their roles with charisma, and the interaction of the different people was refreshing. Also of interest, was the non-typical way that romance was introduced into the movie.

The buddy chemistry between McConaughey and Zahn was great and Bill Macy was perfect as Sandecker. The plot moves with great pace, and I found the way they alluded to the history between the principal characters without ever relying on flashbacks or big chunks of exposition was clever. Penelope Cruz was probably the weakest link, but the role wasn't exactly demanding. I also really liked the way the movie made Africa look colourful and vibrant.

The film's two stars, Cruz and McConaughey, have about as much screen sizzle together as Jello on Toast. Dialogue between all the characters for that matter seemed forced.Too many plausibility issues for me to be truly sold into believing this plot. The characters keep having to explain the plot to you as the movie plays out. The plot at times is so complex the actors keep having to explain it to you numerous times throughout the movie. If issues of plot credibility don't really matter to you and all you want is a chance to ogle a Orange looking, more often than not shirtless, McConaughey or a tired looking, and a all too often rather than not, fully clad Cruz. Then this flick is for you. Many things seem to get randomly blown up in it. Unfortunately the film itself wasn't one of them.William Macy was great in the role of the admiral however.

People say if you like an action movie to go and see this one. I beg to differ, this movie MIGHT fall into the action category at Blockbuster, but it is not a big action flick like Matrix or even The Mummy for that matter.Good storyline, though the plot outline that is on its homepage here will give many people, as they did me, the wrong impression of this movie. If people went to this movie expecting ""Outbreak (Dustin Hoffman"" with some more action, than it wouldn't have such a low rating, but the fact is everyone, like me, went to see this movie to get to see how the tale of the boat under the sands of the Sahara got there and this was not given.

Add to that the entire Kitty Mannock thread was either cut or ignored and then loose the boat trip up the Niger in West Africe and it becomes hollow and lacking in substance. Then cut out the action sequence at the end in Fort Fouraeu which made the movie sequence look like a Laurel and Hardy movie! The finale of this travesty of a movie was the casting - Dirk Pitt is supposed to be a handsome lady killer, not a someone who resembles a typical redneck. the actor playing Al Giordino is also a completely wrong choice as well.To sum up, it even makes the Raise the Titanic disaster look good!

320,cverri,Cussler Fans Beware...,6,8 March 2005,"I just got home from a preview screening. Here's my rant: As a reader of Pitt novels since 1989, I was anticipating the release of this film as much as anyone. Of course, I knew there would be some deviations or omissions from the book since it is 541 pages long. There's way to much there to put in one film, so all I wanted was a film that was entertaining and true to the characters in the series. I was cautiously optimistic upon entering the theater, and 124 minutes later, I left downright disappointed. My first thought as I reached the parking lot was, ""Cussler fans are gonna hate this."" And that is unfortunate, because once again we are given a film with a script that misses the point. There are certain aspects to this series of novels that you can't change, condense, or omit without fouling up the overall tone of the story and enraging readers.NUMA is portrayed as a fledgling private organization; Dirk Pitt is described in the OPENING CREDITS as a ""fanatical"" treasure hunter; Rudi Gunn acts more like a stoner than Sandecker's right-hand man; no explanation is given for the wrecked aircraft Pitt & Giordino stumble upon; the list goes on...Add to these discrepancies the painful delivery from Penelope Cruz and the fact that most film-goers may not be willing to suspend ALL belief the way we Cussler readers have grown accustomed to doing, and the likelihood of a sequel is extremely slim.And that may be what disappoints me the most. Despite all that I disliked about the film, what I found encouraging was the portrayal of Pitt & Giordino by Matthew McConaughey and Steve Zahn. This was my greatest concern going into the film, and as it turns out, it was the only pleasant surprise. (Way better than what we got out of the late Richard Jordan) Sure, it's not exactly like it is in the books...it never is. But the chemistry is there; you believe these two have known each other forever. (probably because they are friends in real life) Given a better script (preferably one Cussler DOESN'T have to sue over), I believe these two could turn in a Pitt movie that would actually be crowd pleasing and moderately accepted by most fans.Unfortunately, that day will likely never come. Hollywood has given us two Sub-Par Pitt Films. That may be all we get.There is, however, one thing they got right. Keep your eyes open for the upgraded DOXA Sub-600T Professional!

The advance press for /Sahara/, with its obvious links to treasure hunting and to intrigue, led me to believe that I'd enjoy it more than, say, recent Vin Diesel work. And I was right.Dirk Pitt is an Indiana Jones for the modern day. But he's more. There's an edge, an extra quality of ""can do"" that helps carry the improbabilities of the plot nicely.If you liked /Raiders of the Lost Ark/ or /Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade/, you should go see this picture.Some violence, mostly of the shoot-'em up variety, often more implied than ""in your face"" (and that's a good thing). Definitely intelligent and thoughtful story line.Matthew McConaughey (Dirk Pitt) is easy to watch. Steve Zahn (Al Giordino) is near perfect as his sidekick.

In my opinion, the film should be rated PG-13 for language, not violence. There wasn't much blood. Lots of killing, but nothing graphic. And there were a few scary parts (for younger kids, anyway).

Sahara reminded me a lot of National Treasure. it had the same treasure seeking type of plot, but Sahara had more action, running from the bad guys who are trying to kill them, in the plot. still, i found them remarkably similar. one thing that i didn't like so much, was that it was so obvious what was going to happen. i mean, you could tell even from the poster, that McConaughey and Cruz were going to end up together. and a lot of other things were obvious from the beginning, but i don't want to give the movie away, so i won't say what those things are.",Sahara

Perhaps more movies with this character will be developed in the future. Like the ""Indiana Jones "" movies there is a market for this type of movie.I am also going to read a couple of Cussler's books.",Sahara
326,Tacklbery11,Sahara,5,12 April 2005,"I am a big fan of clove cussler and Sahara was a minor disappointment to me. Mathew is a great actor but read the book and your too will be disappointed. Steve Zahn is also a good actor but no AL and Mather is no Dirk. Both of them needed to be recast with new actors. I did enjoy the movie, but it was not as good as it could have been. While it was a good movie, it was not is step with the book. No wonder Cussler is up set with them. I think that the guy from the movie arthur, the lead part, might have been better or even the guy from the first millionaire. I hope that if they make another one, maybe they will pick new actors for the lead roles. Cussler is an master of the mystery novel and his books are great. I do hope he has more control over the next one. jeff",Sahara
327,jade_rising,so much potential,4,12 March 2005,"I caught a advanced screening of this movie and was to say the least disappointed. I'm a huge fan of the Clive Cussler books and this one in particular, is one of my favorites. The movie was just a hack job trying to be what the book was. To much was cut and not enough was explained. Locations change, the plot changed, and they cut out several of the best parts. The casting was also off. Now I like all of the actors in the film, but just thought that the parts they got where wrong. Steve Zahn was too funny for that character and Delroy Lindo could of be used better as Gen. Kazim. Matthew fit Dirk and William fit the admiral (which I had my doubts about), even Rudi Gunn was a good fit. But Penelope didn't really fit Eva and the rest of the cast fell the same way. For what this movie could of been it fell far short of. If your a fan of the Cussler books I recommend staying away, unless you can force yourself to not see it as the book Sahara but just one of the average action movies that will be out this year. Hopefully there is no plans for another Dirk Pitt movie in the plans if this is all we get(by meaning it seemed like half the book content was cut out and those were the important parts!).",Sahara
328,sandy506,Fun action movie with comedy,10,15 May 2005,"I really enjoyed this movie. My husband, middle school daughter, her friend, and another adult went to see this on a Sunday afternoon. The entire audience seemed to have a good time.I've never read any of these books, but I plan to start on them soon. The movie was very funny and the action just kept coming. McConaughey and Zahn are perfect in their roles. This is a perfect movie for times when you want to relax without thinking too hard. I didn't notice any bad language or behavior that you wouldn't want school-age children to see. I recommend it for all ages.I hope this signals a return to the afternoon popcorn movie!",Sahara
329,elix3r,I honestly feel insulted after watching this movie,1,6 June 2005,"Everything was so set up. They just happen to get involved with the sexy foreign doctor trying to save people, they just happen to always get around the armies. No one ever notices when they escape. The bad guys always make just one fatal obvious mistake like no power lines to the power plant. And it also gives no motivation whatsoever for the majority of what takes place. Everyone just asks someone for a favor and thats what sets things in motion. Or pulls out a remember that time back when... do this and we are even. No explanation ever of what happened. I can't even begin to explain how insulting this movie is. It just sends more and more stuff at you to watch that is suppose to be cool or something to see, buts there is no real plot except the dream of finding this ship, and of course saving these poor africans, which of course just all happen in the end at once, and things are magically wrapped up showing all the main characters getting what they want so you will feel good walking out of the movie. So sickening. And just randomly finding a map leading to the ship because his soccer ball went down into some cave, and then happening to throw the dynamite right where the ship was and getting in it just as the helicopter started firing... So lame. Normally I would never be so harsh on a movie. But I seriously hate myself for spending the time to watch it, and was just that offended by it. The end.",Sahara
330,st_valencia,"Please, don't bother....waste of (long) time and money",1,2 July 2005,"A movie where the plot goes like: the confederate's civil war treasure shows up in Africa (??), and a ""humanitarian"" doctor (Penelope Cruz, that by the way can barely speak her lines) along with 2 treasure hunter's (the supposedly funny one not being funny at all) ended up chasing the gold, fighting a disease that can kill the whole world's aquatic life in 1 week, and in the meantime, killing dozens of African's....including the president of a remote country. I wonder....how come that the treasure hunter wears a spotless and wrinkle free white armani suit while in the desert, in the middle of nowhere?. The kind of movie that makes you watch the time every 3 minutes, hoping and waiting for the next 3 ones to get any better. Bravo!",Sahara

It seems whenever he's tried to play the tough guy, who should be taken seriously, he comes across as a pathetic wannabe.Although Cruz has proved her credibility as an actress, when she's portrayed a nutcase/traumatized female, she stinks here. Maybe it's the role.This film TRIES to live up to its adventurous predecessors (Indy Jones; The Mummy; et al), but fails miserably. Any attempt to go after a franchise will be a waste of the investors' resources.",Sahara
332,bizatchgirl,Dirk Pitt the new action hero,7,17 April 2005,"Sahara fits the formula of all true action movies: a likable hero, an unlikely plot, and a girl. Followers of Dirk Pitt's adventures through author Clive Cussler may find that much of the plot was eliminated to make the story movie-worthy. I still thought the movie was good and McConaughey as Dirk exceeded expectations. I've heard some complaints about the unlikely plot but that's what makes it a movie! I have three words: Suspension of Disbelief. Try and name one Bond movie that actually had a realistic plot line. For what they movie may have lacked, there are many more Dirk Pitt adventures waiting to grace the big screen and make the Cussler fans happy. If you liked the movie, love the book! Dirk Pitt, the new Indiana Jones of the high seas.",Sahara
333,filmscribe1,"Lots of action, a few laughs, but too silly...",5,2 September 2005,"There are way too many silly moments in Sahara, to consider this even an average action flick. Though McConaughey and Zahn do have some chemistry together (Zahn is specially funny), everyone has to struggle frequently (even Bill Macy), as the plot is often forced, and we are constantly shown situations that undermine any suspension of disbelief anyone with at least a decent IQ could allow. Don't get me wrong... I love action films that solely want to entertain without challenging your intellect. The Indiana Jones series and most James Bond movies are good examples of highly-entertaining, action-packed movies, where you have to allow for a lot of unbelievable things to happen, the difference being that they are ""established"" gracefully, never ""forcing"" you to accept them. In ""Sahara"", sequences like the ""doing a Panama"", among others, require of the audience to push that suspension of disbelief to strenuous levels as, even with amazing talents, ""believable heroes"" -and even Superman is one of these- wouldn't make the decisions made by this movie's characters. ""Sahara"" is a movie to watch on TV, and just for light entertainment, when you're tired from a day's work and your mind is not functioning at full capacity.",Sahara
334,cee2,Boring,1,18 April 2005,"This movie, in my mind, was a mistake. One, big,ugly, mistake. With some action(or so they like to call it that) movies,unlike this one, they are mixed up with a lot of jokes.They may have tried to attempt it, but not even close to succeeding. The creator of this film must have had something wrong with him, to think for a second that they could get away with such a terrible move. I was a very predictable movie. There was nothing to be shocked about. It was not Mattew McConaghy's fault that his character was so bad, I don't think so anyway. He was good in reign of fire ( which I highly recommend to anyone who has something better to do than watch this bad movie ). All in all, this movie was very boring, with a half smile being put on the audiences faces at rare times. And the best thing about this movie was (a the popcorn and (b getting the chance to throw M&Ms at the annoying teen in front of me.",Sahara
335,graebel,If you like the books you'll like the movie.,7,8 April 2005,"Well, if you're hankering for an action movie like the first Matrix, Sahara will not be for you. But if you liked the books, Matthew McConaughy does a surprisingly good job.Dirk Pitt is slicker than James Bond, always has the witty comebacks, and always, always, always survives death to win the girl. He's too good to be true. The movie certainly tries to keep it a fun, quick ride as long as you suspend your disbelief before the previews are over.A lot of audience laughter was over the amusing MacGyver style antics - which is also a Cussler trademark.Excellent popcorn movie. But don't expect to be wowed or amazed. Standard action fare with a couple of truly funny moments.",Sahara
336,edumibog14,An entertaining letdown for Cussler fans,6,12 November 2005,"Though I haven't actually read Sahara, I have read many other of Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt adventures. I have to say that Matthew McConaughey made a disappointingly flat and wooden Dirk Pitt. Quite simply, he was all muscle and little personality. Steve Zahn was convincing as Al Giordino, but the most interesting character of them all was Penelope Cruz (Ava), because she was the most likable, yet she wasn't even a main character! Also, for those who have read the Dirk Pitt books, ever noticed that Rudi Gunn is supposed to be short? I couldn't even believe that the character portrayed was supposed to be him. Sahara is an entertaining movie (though predictable, as adventure/action movies often are). If you haven't read any of Clive Cussler's books, you'll probably like it. For Cussler fans, though, a letdown.",Sahara
337,jeffali,Don't believe the (negative) hype,7,19 April 2005,"Its possible that I'm easily pleased but Sahara surprised me. I'm a bit of a Cusslerphile and have hoped against hope for years now of a screen adaptation of one of his books, preferably Inca Gold. Considering this I, like many other Cussler readers, had my own prejudices about how the characters should be portrayed. I have to say, that against expectation and my initial reaction at the beginning of the film, McConnaughey made a believable Dirk Pitt, less so Steve Zahn as Al Giordino (he's always been a Young Bob Hoskins type character in both my mind and in print). However Zahn has the character completely spot on. Penelope Cruz was wooden and dreadful but then that's not much of a surprise to anyone is it? As for the plot, it keeps moving along at a decent pace and is fairly true to the book although I was disappointed the Kitty Mannock scenes had been edited out and that there was no Abe Licoln at the helm of the ironclad (you'll have to read the book). Also I was kind of hoping for a Cussler cameo, like the books but given his lawsuit maybe that was a long shot! My major criticism is that it needed to flesh out the characters a bit more. Pitt is a far better literary character (the tequila, the vintage cars, the gourmet food) and some of this detail would have enhanced the film. Its been described as brainless in the newspaper I read but at the end of the 2 hours I felt it had been worth it. I certainly had a smile on my face for the majority of the film! I hope this leads to more Cussler adaptations as Sahara is not one of the best books.",Sahara
338,Shinigami600,How Can This Get Any Better? (Minor Spoilers),9,15 April 2005,"Honestly, it's a great film. Dirk is the heroic never-gives-up type, Al is the ""Why does it have to be me?"" type, and Eva is the hot foreign babe with the sexy accent. Basically it's about Dirk's obsession to find a long-lost Civil War ship, and gets stuck with Al and Eva in the fight to find a cure for toxins in the Niger River. Al always seems to bring comedy to the film, and he makes comments that are so funny that the writers should be payed overtime. How Eva gets stuck in the well when the villains attacked her partners was exciting and gives its fair share of a scare or two. If there was a sequel, it won't be as good because the original has all the fun.",Sahara
339,h_tl,"A lavish, vigorous attempt at exciting entertainment",3,29 March 2005,"It started with an interesting action scene of an ironclad-ship battle in the Civil War, and the rest was riddled with helicopters, explosions, gunfire, death-defying leaps, vertigo- inducing rescues, plague victims, chase scenes involving trains, cigarette boats, and an antique roadster, ingenious mechanical improvisations, and the occasional decorous presence of Penelope Cruz. At this red carpet Premiere there were frequent cheers by the hometown Austin crowd whenever Matthew rescued the damsel or otherwise saved the day, but even this highly receptive audience could not muster more than polite, forced- enthusiasm in their final applause. It seems like it is trying to be Indiana Jones, but without any Harrison Ford. Female viewers may be enthralled with Matthew (as they were by his personal appearance at this Premiere) but, although he seems like a cool guy, I found myself not paying much attention to what his character said, did, or was about to do.",Sahara
340,FHickcox,Better than expected,8,30 March 2005,"I just saw the sneak preview last night. It was great. The trailers didn't make the movie look all that good to me. But I went to the ""Sneak Preview"" and was thoroughly entertained. This is a great move & would be a great summer action movie & I would recommend EVERYBODY go see it. I also liked that there was no sex, nudity or swearing in the movie at all. Great family fun !! Good action, great humor & a good buddy movie. I know Matthew McConaughey is the lead guy but his best friend (Played by Steve Zahn) was as important and fun to watch as the lead hero. I expected this to be similar to ""National Treasure"".. It's not.... That was fun but ranked low on my list. This was much better and will definitely make it into my personal collection when it's available on DVD. I did like the way the American Guys stuck out but still used ingenuity and charm to get things done.

But I have read some of his books over the years, and was looking forward to the release of this film.***** I feel like most movies released today are worthless, and are made to cater to the lowest common denominator, i.e. 13-year old ADD-addled kids.So, I went to see Sahara hoping for the best, and expecting the worst.And I was pleasantly surprised.The movie was exciting and action-packed, but not overly-done.Zahn as Al? I fully expected this to be the downfall of the movie; Zahn was going to be the stereotypical comic-relief sidekick. Again, I was pleasantly surprised. Zahn pulled the part off pretty well, with no ""goofy sidekick"" antics.There were a few small shortcomings of course, but overall I highly recommend it.Some things I was curious about though: Which one of the producers/directors is the classic rock fan? It seems like every other scene has some classic rock blaring in the background. sometimes subtly, like a soundtrack should be, other times not-so-subtly, were it ends up sounding out of place. (Grand Funk Railroad blaring while raising a statue from the depths of the ocean?) Gunpowder, fuses, chains, cannons still working on the USS Texas after 140 years in the desert? I'm not an archaeologist, but I find that doubtful.An algae plume that covers the entire planet? I'm not a marine biologist, but again, doubtful.As some other astute viewers pointed out, the Arabic text going from left to right, tires still inflated on the plane in the desert. As well as the fact of mounting that wing as a sail on the top of the plane. I'm not quite sure how one could do that.But, overall, like I said, definitely worth the 7 bucks.",Sahara
342,martin-joey,Couldn't Make Up their Minds (Spoiler warning),4,11 April 2005,"I was excited about seeing this movie, but spent the whole thing trying to figure out where it was headed. I think they couldn't decide if they wanted to make a movie about environmental responsibility or one about a treasure hunt. Part of the time, it was 'Outbreak', and part of the time, National Treasure. I kept thinking that these two stories were going to eventually run together and have a common cause or solution, but the two story lines never meshed. They just ran parallel to each other right to the end. When they found the treasure, it was like, ""Oh, there it is."" What seemed to be the main thread from the beginning was finding the Civil War boat. But when they found it, it was like, ""Oh, there it is."" And the finding of the gold was underwhelming as well. This movie had a lot of potential, but I think it could've been MUCH better.",Sahara
343,filmfan68,Surprisingly bad,3,6 September 2005,"I purchased this film on impulse, with relatively low expectations. I was quite disappointed, despite my low expectations. I felt that this movie missed the mark on virtually every level. The only positives i can mention are Steve Zahn, who does provide some much needed comic relief and some of the action sequences were well put together, even if they are completely ridiculous and unbelievable.There are far too many negatives to write here , so i will simply say that if you like to make fun of movies with cheesy dialog and very unbelievable coincidences this may amuse you.

I can see why one might say it has many technical flaws, plot holes, or over-the-top action sequences, but like the previous reviewer stated, it's just a fun movie. I found nothing wrong with the acting, even if I don't think they are the best lead actor or actress they could have hired for this film. The special effects were fine with no technical flaws I could see, if a bit exaggerated in the opening scene.For any movie critics out there: Suspend your disbelief for a moment and stop looking at it with a technical eye.

Or maybe I couldn't blink because I was afraid I would miss Dirk flashing that oh so amazing smile over and over that keeps you wondering just how he manages to look so scruffy and so cute all at the same time.We will be purchasing this one for our home collection.

Relax and enjoy it, and you'll have a good time, try and be the ""thats not possible"" guy and the movie starts out wrong and just gets wronger.The only serious rip I have on it is that if you are going to cast Penelope Cruz in something, make sure there are a few shots of her in a tiny bikini, or at least scantily clad. No such luck in this film, where she is covered in sand and wearing khakis most of the time.",Sahara
348,seblake-1,This is a great Dirk Pitt movie,8,11 May 2005,"I admit I was very reluctant to see this movie because the advertising seemed to indicate a total trashing of the Dirk Pitt / NUMA franchise. Also, author Clive Cussler was distancing himself from the treatment. But now, having seen it, I was very impressed how well the actors, directing and script conveyed the essence of the novel. I vote they continue with the series.I am surprised to see the virulent critiques attacking this movie. I almost suspect those writers did not even view the movie. Rather they are basing their reaction to the smug looking poster, the goof-ball trailers or their allegiance to Cussler as I once had. Or, even worse, they never read the source novel or any of the others in the Pitt series and didn't know what to expect. They certainly did not see the movie I saw.Bottom line, the producers spent a lot of money well and made a very entertaining Dirk Pitt movie. The characters are portrayed appropriately and the escapist action was pulled right from the book. So what is Clive Cussler's beef and why is he sabotaging this film? Sahara is certainly not the disaster that Raise the Titanic was. The only noticeable omission from the novel was Cussler's most audacious and bogus premise ever. (Clue: It was the other treasure found in the Civil War boat). And dropping that clunker from the story was an excellent decision.",Sahara

Her voice is fantastic, and her facial expressions are right on cue. She is definitely a scene stealer in this one, despite the 2 great male leads.As for the movie, some might say it is a bit predictable, and I would not disagree with them at all, as it is not hard to see what is coming. However, there are also a couple of surprises for the viewer. I highly recommend this movie to any history buff or action lover.

351,mtppg1,Disappointing to an avid Cussler fan... not worthy of the legacy of his novels,4,1 September 2005,"As stated in the summary, this film disappointed me. The first few minutes were promising enough (the intro) and seemed appropriate, but that's where the editing took a turn for the worse. First, the cast was disappointing. To viewers that have not read any Dirk Pitt novels, I would say, OK, go ahead and watch it, but it's kind of choppy, and doesn't have realistic transitions. If you have entertained Dirk Pitt novels, then I would recommend that if you did choose to see this film, that you don't go in expecting much, and maybe you'll enjoy it more. Though the cast does well together, both the appearance and mannerisms of the characters do not fit those presented in Clive Cussler's best selling series.Quick Summary for those who didn't want to read this whole thing: If you've read the novel: The events are grotesquely maimed and the cast don't fit their roles. Expect to be disappointed.If you haven't read the novel: Still a fun film, but the plot is not very plausible, and the transitions are terrible.",Sahara
352,pnewman98,The Book was a better movie,5,6 October 2006,"This movie was okay; nothing better, nothing worse. However, the book Sahara was phenomenally good, though unbelievable. Some of the scenes from the book, like the running battle along the Niger, or especially the giant battle at the end, would have made such better movie material than what they shot here. When the UN troops come in in the book and hole up in the old French Foreign Legion Fort to stand up to the entire Malian army and air force, you can just see it happening. While it may have been a little more expensive, it would also have been so much more memorable and cooler than Dirk, Al, and Eva jumping inside the Texas and shooting down Kazim's helicopter with a cannonball.That last stand deserves to be on the big screen, not this slop.",Sahara

Too bad because it was all-fun, all-spectacular, non-vulgar action and excitement! Gosh, is that wrong? Is there something I'm missing here? There's no excuses to be made for this movie. The cinematography was great, the story was cool, the characters were fleshed out and the acting was just what it should be. It all clicked. It's just too bad this didn't get more attention when it was out, because it is a greatly entertaining movie. Not enough sobbing over social injustice or artificially implanted political correctness, I suppose.For all the naysayers out there: lighten up! This is a great movie!

Some things in it are hard to buy (especially the cannon scene towards the end) but since when have action movies ever conformed to the laws of realism? The civil war scene at the beginning kind of confused me, but hang in there when you watch it, it makes sense later on.Great setting, too. The heart of the African desert is something I haven't seen other action flicks play around with but it definitely makes for a flavorful environment.A lot of fun.

There are fine action sequences, as ever with these sorts of films, but i found that because there was hardly, if any character development at all, and no real sympathy created for the victims (with the exception of a lame attempt at scaring us toward the beginning with a dead body)i did not really care whether the protagonists triumphed at the end or not. Effectively,all this movie was good for was its display of action sequences, which are watchable for adults, but probably very enjoyable for its younger, target audience. Overall, a half-decent movie, probably deserves a little more credit than this, which is why i have given it six out of ten, but more a showcase of several enjoyable action scenes than a solid, well crafted film.",Sahara
357,Ent-4,Absolutely Fantastic film,10,11 April 2005,In this time of war I loved the true escapism this film offered. It was a fun Indiana Jones typeroller-coaster that has only suffered due to opening too soon. It should have been held a bit longer to be closer to a holiday and to summer. If you want to have a fun afternoon or evening go enjoy this one...Matthew and Steve make a fantastic pair in this consummate buddy action picture. Matthew also shows his true abilities by allowing Steve to shine and steal his own scenes. I have seen many a lead actor hog the scenes but these true come across as true friends that have been together for ages. Not to mention Matthews amazing body in this film. I cant wait for the DVD and all the extras.,Sahara

Having said that, I had a tough time deciding to leave the theatre, even though I was leaving in order to catch the beginning of ""Kung Fu Hustle,"" a movie I've been looking forward to seeing for some time (btw, FANTASTIC film). What this means is that I have the fortunate vantage point that comes with not having experienced the apparently horrid plot devices and dialogue that were to come (judging only by the forum entries, although the person who sounded most intelligent rather enjoyed it).From, my vantage point, I noticed several things, all good. These were: 1) Penelope Cruz...My god, if she isn't the absolute essence of feminine beauty then I don't know what the term means; I wanted to jump all over her for the entire 30 minutes, just like I did when I saw her in Vanilla Sky, another underrated movie; maybe I just like ethnic women, but there's something about her face that gets my attention in a way more powerful than the more traditional beauty of, say, Julia Roberts, Cameron Diaz, even that really hot chick from Sin City; Cruz tops all of them...then again, the most attractive white woman ever, in my opinion, was Shelly Long in ""Cheers""; 2) VERY GOOD, bordering on GREAT direction the first 30 minutes. I know many of you are completely ignorant of the directorial qualities of movies you see. Do yourself a favor, would you?, and start using part of your brain as you observe a flick to ponder over how the director chose to present the scene to you, and how it could have been different. Sometimes you'll find that great directors are at work even in the worst movies, and you can take something enjoyable from something plebes would write off as pure rubbish. It's easy to judge the script and acting of a film. At least, it's easy to spot bad acting or a bad script. It's not so easy to judge the direction/cinematography/art direction/editing, etc. of a film apart from the more obvious filmic qualities. From this perspective, Sahara was entertaining to me. I thought the direction in, for instance, the scene where she was attacked on the beach, was stylish, very effective at conveying the nature of the scene, and, quite simply, entertaining. I like very much the fact that Hollywood seems willing to give unknown directors a shot if they seem to have talent as a director. This guy hadn't done anything prior to this movie. I guarantee that someone will sit up and take notice of his work in this film and give him a shot to direct a film of more import. I say congrats to this young man on taking advantage of his ""big break."" ; 3) Excellent ""buddy"" chemistry between McConnafdhsahf (can't spell his name) and the other guy on the boat(don't know his name); 4) Nice special effects in the civil war scene.I know I haven't seen the movie, but I thought I would put this review out there, if only to provide more proof that a movie that pseudo-intellects hate can be enjoyable on a deeper level.",Sahara
359,Psylently,Does what it needs to,7,9 April 2005,"The purist in wants to complain about all the deviations from the book, but they really did do a decent job of converting the story, and more importantly, the feel of the characters. Many of the changes seemed to simply be due to the time constraints of a movie eliminating the ability for much of the back-story necessary for getting many of the jokes in the books. Like the running gag with Sandecker's cigars would have been hard to do, so they give it a brief nod and then go about other ways of setting the tone of Pitt and Giordino's relationship with the Admiral.In the end they end up with an easily digestible adventure film with a plot that does not require too much suspension of disbelief and good interaction between the characters. All in all, a nice popcorn flick that does not feel like a waste of money.I just wish there had been much less Classic Rock in the soundtrack and a lot more of Clint Mansell. I got all excited seeing his name in the opening credits only to be presented with ""Sweet Home Alabama"" and its like, and while they are good songs, it is just not the same.And also Abe. It did not surprise me that this particular plot element was not carried over, but I really did want Abe to be there. Just like Tom Bombadil in Fellowship of the Ring.",Sahara
360,icowland,Read the book it is so much better - or wait for the directors cut.,2,26 May 2006,"Although the film may seem OK to the majority, if you're a fan of Cussler then you will be disappointed with this film. Disjointed is the best way to describe this film, there is just not the progressive linearity that the book contains. The result  you watch the film and think hold on how did we get here! The Actors / characters are OK but again not enough time is given to develop the depth that Clive Cussler gave these characters over many books, resulting in a condensed version of what are otherwise engrossing characters.I hope that one day the directors cut is released with about an hours extra footage included. Until that day if you have read the book prepare to be disappointed. If you have not yet read the book don't judge Clive Cussler's work by this film  read him. In the end a good film is a reflection of many peoples interpretation of a story / premise. Somewhere along the way a great book and story was poorly converted to the big screen in this instance. You could say it's a no brain-er, but the disjointed screen play confuses could be hard to follow.",Sahara
361,karahungi,If only Laurence Olivier was still in his prime! Plus the A-Team's inventiveness!,9,27 March 2007,"It was very untraditional, according to what I know about desert action movies. It proves that there is still some new things left in this world for the average cocky, young, heroic adventurer to discover and do something about. It also has the A-Team's ability to roll with the punches, both physical and metaphorical. In others words, to work with what fate, chance, karma or whatever holds the BIG cards gives the heroes. (I thought it was REALLY inventive, the way that the two main men fixed up a broken old plane to make a very large windsurfer.) The humor was somewhat strange, and the wit was classic American sarcasm, exaggeration and continual controversy. PLUS: a whole lot of complaining. At least, near the end, it stuck with some of the crucial elements near the beginning that made up the story. Good continuity,(goofs not included.) Yes, all in all, I think a generous 9 out of 10 is a more than adequate judge-mark for this film.",Sahara
362,Budapestkick1956,If this film was a country then Israel and Palestine would put aside their differences to unite and destroy it.,1,13 June 2006,"Lets not mince words, Sahara is among the worst films ever created. It's characters consist of three walking clichés who through a series of terrible one liners and odd coincidences set off to Sahara to uncover a civil war era battleship which somehow made it's way to the Sahara desert (The film's explanation for this is ridiculous). The three walking clichés, spouting one-liners and stupid dialogue all the way, travel to the Sahara whereupon through a series of hilarious and ridiculous coincidences the plot is revealed. Examples of these coincidences include when the characters find a vital clue when a football accidentally rolls into the important area and when the intrepid idiots stumble onto the eponymous battleship in the middle of the desert. Yes, out of the entire Sahara desert, the largest desert in the world, the heroes just happen to find the battleship, purely by accident. This is not suspending disbelief, it is expelling disbelief and refusing to acknowledge it's existence at all. The villain (another cliché) is immediately obvious as he has an upper class British accent (In most Hollywood films, the person with a posh British accent is the villain, any characters with a working class or cockney British accent are mere lackeys but still evil). The plot runs it's dragging, laughable course until finally we discover the ridiculous and vomit-inducing truth. The villain of the piece is polluting the oceans of the world for some reason! *Gasp* and must be stopped. The idea that this is comes anywhere close to the quality of Indiana Jones is absolute rubbish, the acting is in parts dire and the characters as mentioned before are all uninteresting clichés. The plot is ridiculous and poorly pieced together and the action sequences merely drag on. This is the worst film I have ever seen (and I've seen Plan 9 from outer space). 1.",Sahara
363,eboselumehibello,Producers please take note,1,16 April 2020,"The producers of this movie certainly did not do their homework. I watched this movie with my Nigerian family and we were all disappointed.
Nigeria wasn't correctly depicted.
1. The locations were not in Nigeria
2. The accents, which were supposed to be Nigerian were not. Please not all Africans sound the same. We all have our unique and beautiful accents. The accents depicted in this movie were mixed. All the actors did what they thought was African and they failed.
3. In the party scene, the two main actors looked disgustingly at a particular fruit. A fruit that I've never eaten before or seen in my country.
4. The setting of the movie is in the year 2005, but they made Nigeria look ancient. First of all, a party of that caliber, Nigerians would not be found dressing that way. I was surprised to see that not 1 Nigerian was wearing a suit or an English dress, which is what will really happen in real life.
5. The movie soundtracks were also not Nigerian. The songs were all sang in an African language that were not Nigerian.
6. The Nigerian flag was wrongly positioned in the party scene
7. Nigeria does not have a dessert so our country shouldn't have been picked as the setting for this movie.I understand that it might not be possible to have all the things needed to depict Nigeria, but the producers should have at least tried to be a bit correct.Movies need to stop promoting the stigma that people abroad have of Africa. Yes there are poor places in Africa but there are also poor places in the US and the Uk.It's also bad that the crew of this movie, while acting the film in Africa, didn't show the expensive hotels, airport and good roads that they experienced while in those places. I'm very sure that they did not sleep in huts or bad homes.Next time please do your research well, especially when you're going to put our flag in your movies. Thank you.",Sahara
364,xseijitsux,Almost a bullseye!,9,5 November 2006,"I've been reading the books since I was nine or ten years old, my first having been Atlantis Found and which still remains my favorite to this day, followed by the entire collection of Clive Cussler's amazing books. I've been saying for YEARS that this series needed to be made into a series of movies, one for nearly every book. When I finally heard that in fact a movie, based on the book Sahara, was finally in production, I nearly died and went to heaven. It had been a good six years since I had read the corresponding book, but I still remembered it somewhat.Matthew McConaughey is one of my favorite actors, but honestly I had never thought he would work as the beloved Dirk Pitt. Yet, when I saw him with his hair dyed and the green contacts, I knew he was a near match physically. Seeing the movie would be the final test, and I was not disappointed. When I finally knew he was the one, the moment that sent shivers down my spine, was when he went barefoot into that temple looking for knowledge, standing in the shadow and light in his khaki colored outfit....that was when I knew he was Dirk Pitt. He gave a flawless performance that I hope nearly all fans of Dirk could be happy with, men and women alike.Steve Zahn cast as the just as beloved Al Giordino was a complete joke to me from the start. I may be a purist when it comes to movies based on books, but I was sorely disappointed when he was cast instead of a short, barrel-chested Italian with a shock of curly black hair, and a finger missing on one hand. The man who could sleep anywhere anytime, the man who could communicate disturbingly well with Dirk without ever speaking a word, the man you knew you and Dirk could count on. I could have accepted a complete set of fingers, or even a guy who wasn't really Italian, or all that short as long as he was shorter than Dirk's actor, but instead they brought in a joker. Steve Zahn certainly has a kind of chemistry that worked well with Matthew McConaughey, and he certainly could steal the show for the right viewer, but I find his performance and his entire presence in the movie a distraction, and an insult to Al Giordino's true character.Raine Wilson as Rudi Gunn was passable, but not really that much like Rudi. The character really is dweeb-like with glasses, but not nearly as helpless as Raine made him out to be. He could kick serious butt when the situation demanded it.William H. Macy was a surprise to me as Admiral James Sandecker, and not quite what I physically pictured (i.e. he didn't have the pointed Vandyke goatee he was supposed to have, as well as his hair not quite as blazing red as it should've been), but he ended up being alright for the role. Appearances can be somewhat forgivable, more so than a complete personality change as in the case of Steve's performance as Al. I was disappointed at what little importance was placed on Sandecker's coveted, special order cigars, and Al's uncanny ability to unnerve Sandecker by having identical cigars, assumed to have been stolen from Sandecker's secret stash(es), but that kind of thing can be hard to portray without a narrator with complete insight, so I forgive them for that. I also hope if the movies continue, they will show the N.U.M.A. headquarters, and Sandecker's commanding role at the facility.Since Penelope Cruz is not one of my personal favorite actresses, I was not excited at her being cast opposite Matthew McConaughey as Eva Rohas. But upon watching it, I found that she was perfect for the role, held her own, and offered a certain flare to the movie, so much so that I found the movie would not have been complete had she not been cast for the role.Much of the movie, and the books really, is full of coincidences that seem unreal, nearly impossible stunts and impromptu solutions to problems that miraculously work and save the day, but to me they add something to the legend that is Dirk Pitt, and also to Al Giordino. The reality is both Dirk and Al are intelligent men with more ingenuity that more than twice as many normal men could ever hope to possess, who are incredibly close and work flawlessly together as a team with a slew of support people and resources in the N.U.M.A. organization (shown more in the books than in the movie, which I hope will change). They are two men with an unwavering sense of justice, a strong determination to do what is right, and the ability and knowhow to do so. What more could anyone ask for of any hero, super or not, and his near equal sidekick? I gave a rating a little less than perfect because of the presence of Steve Zahn, Raine Wilson not quite up to par, and the fact that much of the story was changed from the book...too much, in my opinion.All in all a very enjoyable film, and I do look forward to the next installments of the series, if they ever manage to make it to production.",Sahara

I grew up in Lagos, and there definitely isn't a single part of the city that looks anything like the crap they had in this movie and people who do not have enough money for medicine cannot make it to Lagos and back in week . . . shame on Hollywood for exploiting Africa yet again. Also Nigerian Muslims do not dress in black swaths of cloth around their faces, and I'm pretty sure they could have found Nigerians in the United States to tell them what the accent sounds like, because none of the people in this movie come close . . . not even.

Its good mindless fun and action. I've read some ppl commenting that the disease in the film should have been AIDS instead of the toxic water thing, but action movies are not much fun when they involve ppl driving through informal settlements throwing condoms at the residents. This movie is not meant to highlight the aids epidemic, the poverty in Africa or any other humanitarian/political/social issues ANYWHERE, its about some action and humour and chance to escape reality for a while. I notice as well that most of the posters who have negative comments seem to have a movie making background or liberally throw in references to art films, well the movie isn't aimed at your idea of a good movie (thank god).",Sahara

For anyone that has read any of the stories, there is no way Matthew McConaughey could ever pull off Dirk Pitt, and Steve Zahn is even more unbelievable trying to play Al Giordino. Watching these two trying to pull off the roles was painful. The story was also ""dumbed down"" in favor of fitting in as many explosions as possible. Unfortunately it seems that Clive Cussler can't get a break when it comes to making the transition from book to screen, which is too bad because his books are a lot of fun to read. Bottom line. If you have read any of the Clive Cussler books stay away from this movie. If you have no idea who Dirk Pitt is, it is just passable as shoot-em-up get the bad guy in the end movie.",Sahara

The first time was OK, I did enjoy it even though it was laggy in parts and the plot just didn't do it for me. Some of the exposition was WAY too contrived and WAY too easy. I just wasn't buying some of the coincidences. Nonetheless it was watchable and mostly a fun movie and so long as you don't try to take the movie serious you will be OK.

The body discovered in the Texas, the history behind the crashed aircraft deserved at least some attention. Other than those, to me, glaring absences, the movie itself was awesome.

370,charles-479,Stunningly Exciting Action Adventure,10,18 February 2007,"Having seen the film cold, without any pre-knowledge of the plot, or without seeing any reviews, this film is far, far better than the average credit given in reviews. The plot is very wide-ranging and develops atmosphere and intrigue in the first 40 minutes. The action scenes are stunning, real edge of seat scenes and the final 90 minutes had me unable to leave my seat in case of missing anything vital. The 'plague' becoming a toxic effect was intriguing. The dictator cold-bloodily killing the doctor's colleague was as chilling a scene as ever could be imagined. The military run Mali was a surprise, given its location. Once the action started, it was very fast paced and never predictable. In retrospect, some of the characters seemed indestructible, but one could never be sure during the film. Yes some of the action was far-fetched, but often quite humorous!!! Again, are any of the James Bond or Tom Cruise films anything but far-fetched!!! To me, the plot has been very well put together, and like the Bond films may well differ from the book, for cinematic effect. I think it is very well acted, very well-produced and has its own genre, 'similar' to the Jewel or Indiana Jones films. The characters are different, which is an added advantage. The lead actor Matthew McConaughey is a pretty tough character, and his comrades/ compatriots have a softer and often more humorous side to their nature. the romance is not over-played, and Penélope Cruz plays the World Health Organisation (WHO)doctor (Not doctor who!)role demurely and extremely well. It's a shame for various reasons Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt novels won't at present be figuring in any sequels. Sahara did well at the box offices, despite critics efforts to deride the film. This speaks volumes about the film's depth, excitement and audience appeal!!! It does succeed, and who would take it too seriously!!",Sahara
371,livfred,"Fun, well-written movie!",8,24 April 2005,"I expected Sahara to be a typical, dumb, adventure movie. In fact, it's a clever, well-written film. The characters have great motives that make sense, they have a reason for being everywhere they end up, the stunts aren't over-the-top, and their lines are incredibly witty. Often adventure movies sacrifice plot, characterization, and writing for the chance to film bigger and better stunts. This one doesn't do that, and yet it's still very much an action film. The bad guys aren't just evil for the sake of being evil - they have plausible motives. The good guys aren't just heroes because, well, they're the heroes and that's what they do. They have motives!

372,jtpemt,captures the spirit of the book,10,10 April 2005,While Sahara may not be a word for word adaptation of the book. The movie did what I thought was most important. It showed the relationship between Dirk and Al wonderfully. The banter between the two was something you would expect right out of one of the many Dirk Pitt novels. I thought the casting was perfect. Again if not in the appearance of the actors but their relationships with each other. Sahara showed enough of the major story lines of the book to be fairly faithful to the novel. Were liberties taken yes but did it pull it off in the end absolutely. After seeing the movies last night I was going to give it 9 out of 10. What made me bump it up to a 10. Was my wife who had never read a Dirk Pitt novel. Asking my father and I all these questions about Pitt. And saying that she wanted to start reading his other books. So what is the most wonderful thing about this movie. It is a very enjoyable movie. That gets people who have no idea about the source material.

I haven't read the book, so I don't know how well they followed the original story, but I found the film to be well paced and entertaining. As with most action/adventure movies, there were some scenes where you think ""yeah, right"", but even those were entertaining enough that you don't really mind suspending disbelief. Steve Zahn provides ample comic relief, but that's not his only job, which was nice to see. And who doesn't love William H Macy?? I'll recommend this movie to my friends.

Waste of time.",Sahara
376,betatest-1,Sahara - A lot of originality and potential that was wasted ...,1,30 July 2009,"Cussler's novel Sahara was a fun action adventure paperback. Most of the Dirk Pitt series is - although later in his career, Cussler tends to rehash previous material from his earlier works. Technically it's not plagiarism, but you find yourself stopping in a chapter and going ""hey, he used this same scene four novels ago"" ...I wasn't expecting the movie to follow the Sahara novel verbatim like, say, the Harry Potter or LOTR films. There's just too much action, too many side-plots, too many humanly impossible scenes - the movie would cost way too much to produce.However - what I personally didn't expect was Crusade Entertainment's hacked up ""National Lampoon meets Lawrence of Arabia"" piece of crap.Seriously, Matthew McConaughey wasn't suited for this part. His Dirk Pitt character wasn't anything like the Dirk Pitt of the books. Steve Zahn's definitely no Al Giordino - Giordino was a skirt chaser in the Cussler novels, not a moron. In matter of fact, the entire casting - smelled worse than camel dung. And Penelope Cruz? Come on, we know she was cast for only one thing ... and it certainly wasn't her acting talents.Crusade kept only the most marginal of the original plot, which quickly degenerated into stupidity. I believe film makers have the right to make certain adjustments so that a movie can be reasonably made from a novel - as long as they remain true to the novel. What Crusade Entertainment did went beyond reasonable - what they barfed across cinema screens wasn't even close to the plot or characters of Cussler's book. It was as if Crusade hadn't even bothered to read the Sahara novel.What could have been a blockbuster - Crusade basically ruined by trying to make a second rate late night Matthew McConaughey action flick. Crusade sabotaged it themselves the moment they veered from the novel and turned it into a bad Hollywood joke that wasted everyone's time and more importantly, money. This is just another case where Hollywood just can't get it right - the material was there to produce a cool original film for once, but once again Hollywood fouled it up.Heck - if I made a film as bad as Sahara, I'd change my production company's name too ... exactly what Crusader Entertainment did when the changed their name to Bristol Bay Productions. Mental note: don't waste time seeing a Bristol Bay Productions film and they owe me two free Regal Cinema tickets! ;^) Next time Mr. Cussler, have BOLLYWOOD make the film! :^)",Sahara
377,eurosong,Disappointing if you've read the book,3,24 August 2005,"As a big Clive Cussler fan, I was greatly looking forward to seeing this film - especially in the light of how badly ""Raise The Titanic"" has fared in its film version. ""Sahara"" was full of promise.Unfortunately, the film-makers have overlooked everything that was great about the book, and we're left with another run-of-the-mill adventure film.Where was the epic trek across the desert, full of hardship and thirst? That is *the* essence of the book: how Dirk and Al endured one of nature's toughest tests. The film makes their journey seem like a stroll along a California beach, albeit with a large sand dune or two.Where was the plot about Massarde and Kazim keeping prisoners in inhuman conditions and using them as slave labour? The film shows one scene that tells us some of Kazim's enemy soldiers had been captured. Sorry, but that's not the same. The reason the bad guys are SO evil in the book is because the book shows you what they're capable of. The film merely portrays them as a kindergarten criminal and dictator.Where was the climax, where Massarde got his comeuppance? The ending of the film is tame to say the least.The biggest disappointment, however, was that none of the major characters were remotely like Cussler's original creations. Pitt in the film is a surfer dude; Cussler's original character has a lot more depth and sophistication. Giordino is supposed to be a stocky, curly-haired Italian with a deadpan sense of humour. None of these elements are present in the film Giordino! Sandecker is supposed to play hardball. Cussler's Sandecker would never have accepted being brushed off by the government official as he was in the film.Is it right for me to judge the film based upon my expectations from Clive Cussler's characters and his novel? Yes, I think this is perfectly fair. It's supposed to be a film based upon the book. While I accept that a regular-length film will never be able to contain all the plot and depth of a thick novel, it should at least take a stab at including all the most important elements. All of these are missing in the film.A word of advice to those fans of Clive Cussler: don't expect too much.",Sahara

But the French guy doesn't burn the materials; instead he just buries them beneath his fully functional solar plant, and by doing so threatens to DESTROY THE WORLD! The chemicals seep into an underground river, poisoning several hundred miles of villages in Mali. As soon as the toxins in the water reach the salt water of the Atlantic Ocean, the world is doomed!Meanwhile, Dirk Pitt and his daring crew appeared in Africa looking for a Confederate ironclad boat from the American Civil War, because it had a single gold coin in it, in which Dirk was very interested. Yes, really. While they are there, they somehow stumble across the ""evil"" warlord's plans to get rid of waste and keep his country defended from the Tuareg's. The warlord doesn't appreciate the fact that Dirk's crew is trying to prevent the destruction of the waste, and starts attacking the boat the Dirk-crew is riding on. After having several thousand rounds emptied into their tiny speed boat, Dirk gets the idea that they need to pull a ""Panama,"" by which he means they should use a cigar to light some fuel on fire, thus destroying the boat and all the boats around it! Truly a sound plan.Afterwards, they find their way to a village that is being poisoned by the pollution, and find a big rock hanging from the top of a cave that has a picture of the iron ship they were looking for.Then the French guy, who, strangely enough, is named Eve(Yves), decides that he should blow up his own power plant for some reason! So he tries to, while Dirk and some other anonymous character, whom the filmmakers desperately failed to have any deeper motivation than to kill everyone who is not, in fact, himself, fight atop a huge pillar that was inexplicably built in the center of his power plant.Then the warlord shoots at Dirk and his newly-acquired, extremely rare car with his helicopter. Dirk then throws some dynamite into the sandy desert behind his speeding car to blind the helicopter. Their amazing explosive archeology skills uncovered the ironclad they had been searching for all along! So they scramble into the shelter of the ship's two-foot thick iron plating. Unbeknownst to the Dirk-crew, however, is that the helicopter is equipped with magic iron-piercing bullets, which cut through iron plating like AK-47 rounds through a three-foot thick mortar wall! But the crew persevered, and after shooting the modern-day helicopter with a nineteenth-century cannon, the rest of the warlord's army surrendered. Mazeltov.",Sahara

381,grim_jackal,A great adaptation of one of Cussler's best,10,9 April 2005,"Great film. Exceeded my expectations. Worthy of an 8 score for the casting alone. It really feels like Dirk, Al, Rudi, and Sandecker have been at this game for years, and they all work off of each other so well that humor is a natural extension.McConaughey handles Pitt perfectly, and Zahn's every facial expression and utterance is a chuckle. Wilson plays Rudi a tad more geeky than I had imagined him, but it works well in the context of the trio, and Macy brings the down-to-earth class of Sandecker to the screen.The audience I watched it with laughed and even cheered (not something Aussie audiences are really inclined to do).I'm a big Cussler fan, and this gives me high hopes indeed that more adventures may be on the way. Keep the director, keep the cast (sans the love-interest of course), and this could be a very successful series.",Sahara

(even though R.T.T. wasn't very good) As with all books made into movies, some parts/stories are left out due to time constraints etc. There's really nothing that could be done about that. (Abe Lincoln, Tebezza) I loved the movie. I thought Matthew and Steve had great chemistry together and I hope they make another one. As far as the ""far-fetchedness"" of some of the scenes, IT'S A MOVIE! To all of the haters out there, who like to pick apart every movie as if they were eating crab legs,if they make another one,DON'T WATCH IT!",Sahara
383,webmaster-938,Suspend your disbelief and prepare to be entertained,9,7 April 2005,"I have been a huge fan of the Clive Cussler ""Dirk Pitt"" books for a long time now and wondered why such excellent page turners had not been translated to film.I couldn't wait to see it but was also a little worried that they might have made the usual Hollywood hash of an excellent book. I needn't have worried.Yes a few minor details have been glossed over but that did not detract from the entertainment one bit, the books are very graphic in the depiction of action sequences and the camera work did these justice.I went to see this with my wife and we both thoroughly enjoyed it for what it is, a Boy's Own type adventure story.For those who compare it to Indiana Jones / 007 i would agree to a point, i have likened Dirk Pitt to 007 for a long time, but the Dirk Pitt stories are much better.The crowning glory was the casting, never have I seen a screen adaptation of a book I love where the characters look so like they do in my head; until now. Superb.If you want to be entertained and amused without having to tax your brain go see this film, and read the books. It doesn't break and new ground artistically but who cares, there's a time and a place for all sorts of films and if they are done as well as this I will enjoy them all.",Sahara

I say this because I have read very one of Clive Cusslers Dirk Pitt novels and Dirk Pitt, in the novels, is a combination of James Bond and Indiana Jones. Dirk Pitt is a great character that has the potential, if done correctly, to be Hollywood gold. If you don't believe me, just read one of the Dirk Pitt novels. I would suggest starting with Pacific Vortex, the first one in the series.",Sahara

I am praying that this movie does well enough for them to make more. I saw the movie about 2 weeks ago at a sneak preview here in Long Beach, CA. And I was thrilled by the movie. It's got action, it's got adventure, it's got a little love, and it's got a lot of laughs. The key to liking the movie is just being there to enjoy that it's an action adventure movie, with a healthy dose of comedy thrown in. If you're looking to pick apart the movie story line, you're looking too hard. Go see the movie, you will enjoy it whether you know who Dirk Pitt is or not.",Sahara

Why would an iron clad sail from America to Africa? We'd led to believe in act I that this question will be answered, but it isn't. Why is there a chemical decomposition plant in the middle of the Sahara? How did they stop the deadly plague from reaching the Atlantic? How did Breck Eisner get this gig? These questions and more have no answers in the film, making Sahara one of the most poorly structured and laid out stories in quite some time. A fantastic waste of money. Watch it at your own boredom.",Sahara

Macy's Adm. Sandecker. It follows the book pretty good, except NUMA is a private treasure hunting company rather then a government research agency( that might change in the next movie (hope hope)). The one part I wanted to see that was in the novel was when Dirk and Al meet a crusty old miner in the desert who introduces himself as Clive Cussler.Great score BTW, lots of old rock and roll that goes with the action, it's not a GREAT movie, but it's a good action one.",Sahara
388,jagsing,A good but somehow underrated movie,9,4 August 2005,"Wonder why only movies with really heavy star cast are able to do well as far as this genre is concerned. Just the name of Harrison Ford would have been able to secure a rating of 8+ for this movie, which unfortunately is not the case. Its a nice and unpredictable movie needing viewer's constant attention. The pace is good. Is refreshing not to see any stereotyped cast. The heroics are evenly shared by the three main protagonists, which is also a welcome change. The action scenes are not so clichéd, so one can enjoy them. The movie did not try to establish any chemistry between the male and female lead and seems justifiable looking at the pace of the flick. Overall, the movie impresses.",Sahara

Would've been a bit like the resident evil game though. We could've had undead confederate sailors infect Africa with the zombie virus back in 1866 when the boat reached the coast. We coulda had the general hiding in his walled fortress in the capital while the rest of his country is over run with zombies. We coulda had mathew mcconahey say ""well alright, alright, alright"" as he blasts away every zombie he finds. Imagine for a second what a zombie camel would look like. Just imagine. The possibilities are endless. A world wide epidemic of ghouls. That would've been a hot ticket man.",Sahara

Good we did not leave the cinema yet. The graphics was nice & the story too. I really like the hilarious parts of the movie. I was having fun watching Sahara and my money was worth it. Matthew McConaughey & Penelope Cruz acted great in the movie. For me the movie was one of the greatest this 2005 but I just didn't really like the first half of the movie.It needed a little more effort,I think.I even fell asleep for awhile while watching the movie.Next time,I would sure hope to see more action next time.",Sahara
391,keith-preston,mediocre,10,21 August 2005,"this movie was the best movie I've ever seen. It held my attention. There was action, there was adventure, there were speedy boats, there were actors and actresses. I thought it was grand. They hunted for treasure while saving ladies, and also ended up doing a good turn for their country. When they did this, they also did a not-so-good turn for the bad guys. All in all, this movie was OK. Maybe not as good as some other movies I've seen, but what can you ask for in this day in age? Certainly not the sort of wonderful plots, acting, scenery, artistic awareness, etc. of the movies of yore, but this is definitely something you could waste $10 or more on. Depends if you have a date or not.",Sahara
392,facebook-573-28845,Loads of fun and thoroughly entertaining.,8,2 February 2019,"As an avid reader of almost everything that Cussler has written to date, it took me a long time to get round to watching Sahara as I was worried that it would not match up to the novel in the usual way that films frequently do. This was no great exception but certainly none the worse for it. A great laugh, didn't take itself too seriously at all and overall I'd recommend this to anyone wanting to escape for a couple of hours.
Personally, although I like McConaughey, he wasn't the Dirk Pitt I had in my head after reading the books! Steve Zahn also whilst funny and seeming had good chemistry with McConaughey, was certainly not the Al Giordino either. Get past this and you'll enjoy it greatly.",Sahara

394,Eriksonmobile,looking for an entertaining night at the movies?,8,18 April 2005,"I did not expect much when I went to see Sahara last weekend, after I read a couple of mediocre reviews. But I have to say I was really surprised by how good it was. I have to admit I only read one Dirk Pitt book so far and back than already wondered why there had never been a big-budget movie about the character. It is possible that hardcore fans may find the film not as good as the book - but has there ever been a different case? Anyway, I felt McConaughey did a good job portraying Pitt, as well as Zahn playing his ""side-kick"". They work well together and Zahn's comical insertions are well placed. The only real let down is maybe Penelope Cruz. But at least she is nice to look at.It is a very well made Action-Adventure which honestly lets you forget the time spent in your seat. Although we never really find out how and why a civil war vessel was able to make its way to Africa it doesn't disrupt the viewing experience. The plot is fast-paced and the action sequences are up to the expected standard for a movie of our age.This film wants to entertain its audience - and it succeeds. If you liked the Indiana Jones movies or the Mummy go and watch this film. If you are however bothered by archaeologist that take on secret agent jobs --- you should still watch it and change your mind. In my opinion there is potential for a sequel - Cussler's books are there.",Sahara
395,bendabomb1,Not the movie its billed as,4,10 April 2005,"Sahara started out in good form, setting up a great historically based mystery, ala The Da Vincci Code or National Treasure, but then promptly dropped this intriguing plot line in favor of an over-done ""shoot-em-up"" movie with a James Bond meets Captain Planet twist.Matthew McConaughey embarks on a quest to find out if a Civil War Ironclad ship is somehow buried in the Sahara (the great historically based mystery) and quickly finds himself abandoning this voyage so that he can save the world, get the girl, and solve a small African country's war/genocide/plague problems. He is accompanied by best friend (Steve Zahn)who was throw into the mix for no other reason that to serve as a superfluous comic foil, spouting out 2 hours of distracting 1-liners that just didn't seem to fit into the many life threatening situations in which this heroic duo found themselves.This movie had great potential, based on its ads, to be the Indiana Jones/Treasure hunting/mystery solving movie it was billed to be, but gets lost in a plot line that shouldn't have been in there. The movie couldn't decide if it wanted to be a spy movie, a treasure hunting movie, or a comedic buddy action flick. As such, it failed at achieving any of these goals, never answering all of the questions posed by any of these plot lines.This movie was a lot closer to the 1986 Firewalker with Chuck Noris and Louis Gossett Jr., than its billing as a new National Treasure or The Da Vincci Code.",Sahara
396,marie-bloomfield,An awesome ride,10,29 April 2005,"Sahara was an awesome ride! Written off by critics as a poor-man's Indiana Jones, Dirk Pitt and his disciples put on a superb display of action and laughs - all performed with tongue firmly in cheek.The implausibility of the narrative enhances, rather than undermines, a film designed to entertain.True to the genre, Sahara relies on stereotypes but does so with a likable honesty.Excellent casting prompts the audience to associate with the three leads, fostering an enjoyable escapade across Africa.This movie is what all action/adventure films should strive to be!",Sahara
397,btfenimore,"As long as you forget the book, you'll be fine.",8,7 April 2005,"Just saw an advanced screening. Here's the bottom line, McConaughey makes a decent Pitt. Zahn's just there for comic relief, not really as a proper Giordino. Pitt at first he comes by as a letch, then he starts to grow on you. I have one problem that's been bothering me: Dirk Pitt would not wear some girly necklace!!! I do think MaConaughey has the smile I envisioned though. Technically speaking, there are some goof-ups in the editing and such, but if you're looking for a family action movie,there's lots of explosions and such to ooh and ahh over without a lot of violence and only mild language which was surprising. Just don't go looking for a book adaptation, only a miniseries could do Cussler books properly. See it, give Cussler your money, he deserves every dollar.",Sahara

It started a little slow, but once it got going, it rocked. Matthew McConauhey nailed his character and wasn't too hard on the eyes while doing it. Steve Zahn also turned in a great performance. Matthew and Steve were a great team. James A. Macy is also in the movie and he was was great as usual. The real weakness in the movie for me was Penelope Cruz. The only thing she had going for her was the accent. I didn't buy her in the action role and she didn't blend with the McConaughey and Zahn characters at all. What surprised me the most was that I didn't really think of this as a ""date"" movie but the screening I attended was packed with couples!

Steve Zahn and Matthew McConaughey bounce back one liners better than any on screen pair in a long time. I truly hope that a sequel is to follow so I can see more of the two in action. I am a huge McConaughey fan. I was a little weary of this movie, not sure if he could pull off the part of a famous fictional character. I talked my Stepfather,who is a big Crussler fan,into going and he totally enjoyed it. So I took the chance and was well surprised. That is the kind of movie you start the summer with.

My preconceptions based on the books were not even questioned when the Dirk Pitt saved Eva Rojas coming out of the water. Perfect just how I would have done it. And!! The photography was brilliant and the screenplay was written to perfection. My most sincere congratulations to the director, the cast and crew, and to everyone involved in the picture. I had fears that the film was to be like Raise the Titanic. Where the cast had little to offer. BUT NO!!! Thanks again for making this evening one that I will remember for a long time to come or until they make a sequel to another one of Clive Cusslers Books! I hope so!!!",Sahara
401,IanMurf,I am so disappointed at the adaptation of Cusslers novel,1,8 April 2005,"Firstly, the entire novel is not based around the story of the lost ironclad, but rather that of a toxic chemical which threatens the planet. Dirk Pitt works for NUMA, and by drawing out a storyline in which he fights a mutated red tide it helps to draw away from a pseudo- james bond movie. Having read all of Cusslers novels, and Sahara more than once, I find it so unnerving that the storyline was changed so badly and that Dirk was played by Matthew McConaughey - who did not capture Dirks image at all. I was also upset that Steve Zahn was cast as Giordino (a short Italian BODY BUILDER who is supposed to appear as though he was made of spare bulldozer parts) nothing against Steve Zahn I just find it unfortunate that he was cast as the comic relief when Dirk and Al just simply work together and create dry humor so well in the novel, that there is no need for comic relief. Eva Rojas by Ms. Cruz was tolerable as she was a minor character and I actually liked Admiral Sandecker. My biggest problem was with the poor adaptation of Cusslers novel, I wonder how he could sell out in this manner. I had hoped for a Cussler movie for a very long time and had hoped it would start a legacy similar to that of James Bond - on a much higher level. This movie has crushed my hopes of this and I hope that Cussler either stops selling the rights to his books or fires everyone who made this movie and starts a new project with a novel like Flood Tide, or The Mediterranean Caper.",Sahara
402,lisu1984,"If you've read the book, you'll be disappointed",6,16 April 2005,"Just returned from a viewing of this film. It was a pretty enjoyable flick, fast-paced, pretty well acted... HOWEVER, and a giant HOWEVER it will be... First of all, I'm an avid fan of Clive Cussler's books (I've read them all, usually more than once), and ""Sahara"" is one of my favourites - I've read it at least 4 times (including a week ago). So, while watching, I couldn't help comparing. And the authors have turned a fabulous book into a mediocre adventure flick at the cost of $130m (personally, I don't see, where that's gone). I realise, they had to do some corner-cutting, but c'mon - the Calliope look like a rowboat compared to what I imagined after reading the novel. Actor choices aside, the characters have been completely deformed - Al Giordino - a wise-cracking, robust, resourceful sidekick has been turned into a moron & slob, with a fetish for hats and an inability to tie his bloody tie. Rudi Gunn - a serious scientist with great organizational skills becomes some sort of overgrown fratboy, who can't get laid. For Christ's sake - they gave Massarde a conscience and completely turned around his relation to Kazim - in the book, he was the one pulling all the strings. In addition, they slashed a whole host of fabulous characters from the movie (including St. Julien Perlmutter, Hiram Yaeger, UN Commandos, major Ian Fairweather, Warren Grimes, Melika ... I can do this all day long :>). The plot from the book was altered almost beyond recognition, with most of the actual magic of the novel lost (no Battle of Fort Foureau, no goldmine in Tebezza, no mention of Kitty Mannock, no Abe Lincoln aboard the ""Texas"" ... and there's plenty more where that came from :>). OK, that's about it. Overall, it was a decent action/adventure flick but you'll be left extremely wanting if you've read Cussler's novel (I have a feeling the screenwriters just dozed off while the book was being read out to them or something...). Similarly to ""The Bourne Identity"" with Matt Damon, which made a complete mess of the original masterpiece, opportunities were lost. As a movie - it just gets a 7/10 in my book, as an adaptation - 3/10 at the very best. My recommendation - see it if you must, personally I'd advise you to buy the book - a much better investment.",Sahara
403,kedwards34,A really enjoyable Romp,9,7 April 2005,"I thought his film was a really enjoyable romp.I loved the relationship between Dirk and Al, the chemistry between Matthew Mc and Steve Zahn worked really well and it was easy to believe they had been friends since childhood, an honest team not just a hero and sidekick. The natural dry humour between the pair worked very well and at times had me in stitches.If I had to compare this film to others I suppose it would make me think of a cross between an Indiana Jones and a James Bond movie. I would definitely watch this movie again and if they make any more Dirk Pitt films using the same actors in the main roles then I will plan on watching them too.Hubby (a huge Clive Cussler fan) really enjoyed the film too",Sahara
404,movie_guru_miranda,good movie representation,8,21 April 2005,"Considering that the book this movie is based on is a fairly long one with multiple plots and sub-plots, I think that the movie adaptation was handled very well. I really enjoyed the movie and would watch it again but it does not hold a candle to Cussler's books. If they were to do true justice to Cussler's novel, we would be in front of the screen all day and we all know that is just not possible. Honestly the best adaptation of a book that I have seen in a very very long time. I was hesitant at first because I was not sure how the actors who were cast would fit into the parts they were to play but they were very believable. The soundtrack was phenomenal and I have been searching for the CD ever since viewing the movie in theaters. The locations chosen were perfect for the story. There were a few things that were changed but that always happens when the writers have to adapt from a novel to a screenplay. I do wish they had explained the characters a little more.Someone who is not an avid reader of Cussler might not be able to take the characters actions, especially Dirk's, at face value and deem them believable without a little bit more background information that the pan and scan intro provided. The movie moved very well and I did not even realize I had been sitting for over two hours when the credits started rolling. All in all a good movie that I would recommend.",Sahara

Matthew McConaughey and Steve Zahn make a great team and continue to make the audience laugh throughout the entire movie. It is an action adventure and worth spending the money to see it in the movie theater.Penelope Cruz and Matthew's chemistry was not instantaneous but towards the end they warm up to one another. The setting of the movie was spectacular and Matthew McConaughey was the Executive Director on the movie. He did an incredible job and the casting of the rest of the actors was very good.William H.

If you liked the mummy you should like this. They are kind of similar in their formats. Most movies massacre the book. Books are always better. you just have to realize movies can't show you everything a book can. By now everyone should expect movies to be nothing like their book counterparts! I look forward to adventure movies. And I hope the movie does well. People need to lighten up already! P.S. I like the hat's and t-shirts too! y'all are haters! And penelope is a good actress. Her character was just subtle and quiet like that. He gave away 300 free premiere movie tickets to us military members. I think that shows class. Finally a little thanks for the crap we put up with. He deserves respect for that! I don't see any big stuck up celebrity's going around shaking people's hand and letting them take a picture with them.,Sahara

He's great in it, just the right amount of attitude and laughs. Can't help but think of Harrison Ford as Indy. It's not a rip-of just reminds you of why you loved those movies so much. Small things that'll tick you off: there's a scene where an old plane wreck gets converted into a wind car sort of thing which is fun but implausible and several other things like that. Maybe that just goes with the territory in this kind of movie. Prediction: McConnahay has a big hit on his hands and becomes the next Harrison Ford.",Sahara

A quote from the end of the movie perfectly describes most of it's action scenes: ""There's no way that that sh*t worked."" Keeping that in mind, and suspending disbelief, this was a fun movie that combined a mix of Indiana Jones with MacGyver. Much more action than National Treasure, (which I had trouble watching,) and some funny one liners from Zahn. No nudity, (unless you include McConaughey's bare chest) but if you leave early you will miss an enticing scene before the credits.",Sahara

My husband and I saw this at a sneak preview. We walked out agreeing we would pay to see this movie again! The snappy exchanges between Steve Zahn and Matthew Mc..were fun, mostly believable (if you happen to have several teenage boys living in your house who are always into good fun and winding up with a broken arm, singed cat or soda through the nose between fits of laughter..) and you found yourself looking forward to scenes with their interaction.We need more ""wholesome"" movies like this one!

411,highlinerescue,Should have left Cussler's name off!,6,2 April 2005,"I like a good action flick as much as the next guy, but what happened? I've read every Clive Cussler book out there, and this was disappointing. In 1980 when they released ""Raise the Titanic"", Cussler swore that he would never allow Hollywood to screw up one of his best sellers again. Cussler is a genius, and maybe someday Hollywood will realize this and stop messing up his masterpieces. I'm glad he allowed Hollywood a second chance, and maybe this will open up the opportunity for future movies as well. I know the characters in the Dirk Pitt novels very well, and Matthew M. might be able to pull off Dirk Pitt but he didn't succeed in this movie. Steve Zahn is an absolute disappointment, he might be great with the one-liners and quips, but Al Giordino he's not. When you've read all the Pitt novels twice you know what to look for. Neither actor looks like the characters they portrayed in the movie. Macy on the other hand has everything it takes to portray Adm. Sandecker, albeit he was absent the trademark VanDyke beard. Finally, I hope this will lead to more successful interpretations of Cussler books in the future. If I might offer some advice, I would start by following the story lines much closer, and stick Sylvester Stallone in as Al Giordino. If you talk to any 10 true Cussler fans you're going to hear Sly's name come up at least 6 or 7 times. I gave this movie a 6, it deserves more if you haven't read the novel but my love of Cussler's action-packed stories wouldn't allow me to give it anymore.",Sahara

I came in with low expectations and I was right. This movie is pretty predictable, although there are some spots that you couldn't predict because they didn't make sense. The movie leaves so many questions unanswered its stupid. Throughout most of the movie they leave you thinking the ship is causing the ""plague"", calling it the ""ship of death"", but it's actually (spoilers) a toxic waste plant. How could an ironclad ship reach Africa, and why? They keep asking these questions the entire movie, but they never answer them. The movie follows the same basic format and is surprisingly similar to National Treasure. There's the main ""cool"" character, his friend who provides the comic relief and a babe.

I was very concerned that this would also be bad, but I was very pleasingly surprised. Although I did not picture McConnehey & Zahn as Dirk & Al, it did work. Cruz was just window dressing & there was no chemistry between her & McConnehey. It is a fun buddy movie & I'll hope you'll love it. It was worth my $7.00.

As a ""hard core Dr. Cussler fan"", I was very heartbroken to miss out on the scenes with the yacht, Lincoln, the struggles Pitt took on his initial trek across the Sahara, all of the details about the slave mine... especially the rescue of all of the scientists and engineers who were saved from it. A key moment I felt robbed of was the ""Last Stand at the Alamo"" chapters, yeah they rigged up a cannon and managed to shoot the helicopter... nothing that compared to the blood and characters fighting - to the death - rather than going back to work in the mines though! I DID take the advice that I saw throughout these forums though. It's a MOVIE, and I did my best to view it as such. I was very pleased with the visuals, characters, and their relationships. Even though some very important subplots were left out or corrupted, myself and the audience seemed to have fun, laughed out loud often, and took the plot and characters ""tongue in cheek"" as I believe the Pitt series was meant to be. I was introduced to Dirk Pitt on books on tape. Once I started actually reading Clive's books, I realized what I had been missing. I am hoping that more people will be introduced to the author by this movie, and come to know and love the stories, characters, and attitude that he presents so very well. As was previously mentioned on this forum.... If you want to do a Pitt novel any justice, it better be a multi part mini-series, to fit everything in properly. A cheaper made for TV mini-series with unknown actors, less visual effects, yet staying with the whole real story would keep me glued in my seat forever. For now, I am happy to have seen the characters come to life, and enjoyed my two hours at the movies. It had been a long wait! Love it or hate it, it's just my humble opinion.",Sahara
415,LindseyMarie05,Sahara,10,25 April 2005,"Dear Readers,I strongly recommend you see Sahara. It was a great movie, with an even better storyline. I really enjoyed going and seeing the movie, and if you are a big fan of Matthew McConaughey. He looked very handsome in the movie. The cast was also a good selection. Penelope Cruz and Steve Zahn were also really great in this movie. I really liked the plot outline to the story. The movie had a really good story to follow. I was constantly on the edge of my seat with excitement and anxiousness. I constantly wanted to know what was going to happen next. It was a movie about adventure and ambition. The movie was a big success. As you can tell I really liked the movie and if I was you I would go see it.",Sahara
416,KGoltz,Fantastic movie for all viewers!,10,6 April 2005,"I had the fortunate opportunity to preview this movie and I will probably pay to see it again! Sahara is action-packed, yet subtely romantic. With Dirk's passion for uncovering a myth, and romantic interest in Penelope Cruz's character, this movie is perfect for both genders and appeals to all ages. The plot is true to the book and shows great promise for the future. The constant foreshadowing throughout the film makes me want to watch it again to see what I've missed. If you enjoy films that are entertaining, and audience-capturing, see this film! Hopefully, Paramount will continue Dirk's adventures as the books foretell!",Sahara
417,s-pk,Surprisingly disappointing,6,6 April 2005,"Since a lot of reviewers have already mentioned the story line in earlier reviews, I will not bother. Instead I will explain why, for me, the film was just disappointing.I thoroughly enjoy Clive Cussler's 'Dirk Pitt' adventure books. However as every good storyteller should, he gives just enough descriptive text to allow you to form the words you read into 'pictures in your head'.Thus when I saw Matthew McConaughey as 'Dirk Pitt' he was not the way I thought Cussler has described him. He seemed too young, too cocky and rather unprofessional, - Pitt is very professional, not that young and is not a smart Alec the way he appeared to be played in the film.However when I realised the 'comedy character side kick' was supposed to be Al Giordino, I knew that I should not expect the same level of entertainment from the film as I got from reading the book. Cussler's 'Al' I always took to be a stocky Italian American who was very strong, determined, and had a fun but professional sense of humour.The character played by Steve Zahn was short, not stocky, not Italian and definitely more of a comedy side kick character. I thought he was totally wrong for the part and nothing like the character in the book.I found the fight scenes rather too stalest and some of the action was so far fetched that I almost burst out laughing at the silliness of it! Perhaps it if unfortunate that Cussler's stories are so full of complex plot lines, technical data (which I personally am happy to skip completely, although I expect lots of readers love all that stuff) and you just have to pick odd bits from the books to even get close to being able to make it into a film.Perhaps someone should consider trying to make a CG version and so get closer to the story's in the books and make the characters more like the book versions.Perhaps you should see the film only if you don't read the books.Perhaps you should see the film only if you realised that the film is only 'based' on the book, and your expectations are not that you are going to actually see a film OF the book!",Sahara
418,dchapman-4,Good fun romp round the desert,8,7 April 2005,"The movie is overall a good way to loose yourself for a couple of hours. This type of movie will never impress the Oscar buffs but if you want action and comedy and like things blowing up then this is for you. The acting is in line with the genre, the realms of possibility stretched in places but it is a movie after all. Steve Zahn has holds his own (or at least his hair does - you have to see the film to understand this) against 'Dirk Pitt's' the tanned lean hero machine of a man. I don't remember the book having so much comedic banter between the main characters but it helps keep the film entertaining. There are more serious elements about the environment and African poverty, the warlord bad guys' comment ""Nobody cares about Africa"" about sums up the state of things. They do not dwell on the issues but again don't ignore them. The film is not there to preach but entertain, which it does well. Roll on the next one!",Sahara
419,jender_bias,Not quite as good as the book,6,8 April 2005,"As a huge Clive Cussler fan I jumped at the opportunity to go to a pre-screening of this film, though to be honest, I didn't go in with high expectations. Before even seeing the movie I questioned some of the casting, and that held out throughout the movie. Thought I feel the actors did justice to the personalities of the well-loved characters in the book, I still just can't picture Steve Zahn as Al Giordino. Though appearances aside the movie does a pretty good job of conveying the light-hearted, action loving flavor of ""Sahara"". The plot does sway just enough from the book so that I wasn't making constant comparisons between the two. The biggest downfall, other than Dirk Pitt's eye not being green, is the unbelievable antics of the NUMA crew. That unrealistic escapism is what makes the book charmingly addictive, though I am not sure that the same element can be as effective in a movie.",Sahara
420,ripaquet,Sahara is not bad for what it is,7,8 April 2005,"Being an extreme Clive Cussler fan, I have been looking forward to Sahara for quite a while. I have read all of his books many times over and always enjoy them. The movie had some slower parts in it but overall it is a ""popcorn"" movie. You can not take it too seriously. Itis supposed to be over the top and fun. Will it win any awards? No -it is just a fun film. Having said this, I do have a few problems with the movie. While it is impossible to follow a book perfectly, this one took the tiniest bit of the book and used it. The book had Lincoln in the ship in the desert and the movie made no mention of this. Also the plane in the desert was given no explanation to why it was there. The basic plot of the book was twisted around in what seemed a random order. Too someone who is not a fan of the books, this won't seem a problem. The actors picked for the roles were almost perfect. Steve Zahn doesn't fit the books description of Al but he did capture the essence of the character. McConnehy(spelling?) did a great job as Pitt , given what the script was. I would love to see more movies based on these books - especially if Raise the Titantic was redone.",Sahara
421,mwdlaw90,Not as Bad As Some Critics Think,8,9 April 2005,"I am an avid Cussler fan, while this movie was not a home run it was not as bad as some of the posts have thought. I would like to say it feels like a Romancing the Stone or Indian Jones type of film. For those who are criticizing the feasibility of camels running with trains and the like; these people have obviously never read a Cussler novel. Dirk has encountered the impossible & done the impossible in every Pitt novel. For that matter, how about Indiana Jones riding outside a submarine from Africa to Germany? That was possible right? So if you don't like the fantastic and larger than life heroics of Pitt or an Indiana Jones type of character, don't see this movie, or for that matter don't bother reading a Cussler novel. Your imagination would be too underdeveloped for this sort of stuff. Try some light fun reading like the IRS tax code instead.",Sahara
422,piturra,"Hollywood epic feeling, buddy film & the INTRO is literally a blast!!!**",8,9 April 2005,"Read the book again a few months ago and my wife and I just saw the movie last night! First of all, many story element plot events are not in the movie and the major character backgrounds have been change, ... so don't expect it to be a faithful adaptation of Clive Cussler's book.Like my summary above said, ... It's a Hollywood epic feeling, buddy film & the INTRO is literally a blast!!!** (no spoiler's here) Some of the trailers show some, not all of the bomblastic highlights and that's good since the story unfolds with some unexpectations.Dirk Pitt (Matthew McConaughey) and & Al Giordino (Steve Zahn) are, perfectly cast as the elite daring do team. The chemistry between Dirk and Al are believable and well played to the observed audience approval (& laughter) around us - Century THX Theater was 3/4+ full - late show staring 9:10pm.My wife noted, and I agree that Dirk Pitt's character is not fully flushed out for those not familiar with Clive Cussler's books, but otherwise Matthew McConaughey did a very fine job! I thought the other principal castings were A-OK, including Penelope Cruz (Dr. Eva Rojas).At 2 hrs 7 mins., they covered the plots (trailer reveals those) in the story from beginning to end with efficiency while adding interesting side scene events in-between.All-in-all, excellent pop-corn entertaining blockbuster movie.**Music added to the action and I can't wait to get the DVD and really feel the LFE with my SVS 25-31PCi powered-sub!!!",Sahara
423,banannie847,love it!!!,10,9 April 2005,"I just saw this movie last night. It was great! Sahara was a mix between National Treasure and the Day After Tomorrow but a million times better! All the characters were perfect, including Dirk Pitt-can you say hott?! The tan was a bit too orange but OMG i wouldn't mind waking up to that every morning! The movie was very entertaining; however, at some points it was very predictable. A lot of movies are predictable. I think this was Matthew Mcconaughey's best movie.I will gladly go see it again and buy it on DVD!for now this is my favorite movie..",Sahara
424,thegriz17,Excellent,10,9 April 2005,"While the screenplay did not stay true enough to the book to please avid Cussler fans, the movie is not nearly as preposterous as the critics claim. Everything in the movie works if you treat it with a light heart and are looking for a friendly, fun movie. If you are left with a few questions after watching the movie, read the superb book by Clive Cussler (all 18 Dirk Pitt books if you want) and everything should make sense (except for why the writers decided to go in the direction they did). I understand that it is not possible to take a book as long as Sahara with so many plot elements and include everything in a movie. Time, budget, and other practical restraints prevent screenwriters from transforming a book word for word into a script. However, I do not understand why they feel it was necessary to skew the primary premise of NUMA and the main characters. Subplots aside, the basic elements that define everything about Cussler's books should have been left intact by the writers. However, the film itself is still a really good movie and it is important to treat it like a ""new"" Dirk Pitt adventure if you are a fan of the books. Congratulations to everyone of the cast and crew and thank you for bringing the Dirk Pitt books to life. :o)",Sahara
425,pbusbee,Clive Who?,2,9 April 2005,"When you go see a movie based on a Tom Clancy ""Jack Ryan"" spy novel, or a Michael Crichton novel, you expect so see something that bears some semblance to the book. Not the case here. This movie bears no resemblance whatsoever to the spirit or characters in Cussler's novel. In fact, if this movie had been made independent of the Cussler association, it would be hard to even accuse it of plagiarizing Sahara the book. I completely understand why Cussler is suing. McConaughey is physically perfect for the role of Dirk Pitt, but displays none of the honor, humility, savvy, romance, or mystery of Cussler's Pitt. And Al? The only thing familiar there was the verbal banter. Admiral Sandecker's character was not even close to the hardened, grizzled, political string pulling father figure we've come to love. As far as the dialogue was concerned, I could not remember one single line in the movie that you could've found in the book - not one! The story line was controverted, loosely held together, and illogical. This was, at best, a poorly conceived, terribly screen-written, novicely directed cliché of an action movie that does an injustice to Cussler's well crafted books. I felt cheated when I left, but if you're 12-14 years old, you'll love it.",Sahara
426,veeganmd,Treasure hunters cross paths with WHO medical team and African warlords in a desert tour de force.,10,11 April 2005,"Sahara is a thrilling movie with excellent plot and fantastic action sequences. The characters are believable, their situations thrust them into positions where they must face the odds, and they come through in such a realistic way, you almost forget you're in a movie! The action was awesome, from the opening Civil War era fighting, on through to the hand-to-hand combat, the gunfights, and the flight scenes. A very interesting dimension is added in that despite the suspense and excitement, it's still appropriate for kids and people who'd get the creeps in Indiana Jones' snake scene.We were on a double date and had a great time. The combination of roles and events kept us all engaged, yet without gore. The acting was genuine, the comedic timing of the lines was spot on, and suspense was maintained throughout the entire movie. What a GREAT RIDE!This is a MUST SEE!",Sahara
427,snoopy_peanuts2000,"Great action packed movie, well worth seeing!!",8,10 April 2005,"Yes i know it may seem similar to other films such as nation treasure (that was awesome too) but of course it would be its an ADVENTURE FILM... if u like ya Jackie Chan, Indiana Jones etc.. movies you would love this witty action packed movie...u r bound to come out of the cinemas with a smile right across your face cos in this movie everything that could go wrong does! A trip in search for a lost iron ship from civil war times, and trying to find a cause for the latest plague, leads to a mad search and escaping from government army's all over Mila... what they find out could threaten the whole world as we know it! lol",Sahara
428,jmartinson,"It was good, but not as it was advertised",6,10 April 2005,"All of the advertising for Sahara said it was about the quest to discover the whereabouts of a Civil War Ironclad boat. That was about a quarter of the story, if that. The majority of the movie was about a ""plague"" and the people causing it. It was a large shoot em up with chases and explosions and those all made for a good ""be chased and shoot back"" type of picture. I thought the picture would be more of the characters using their wits to track clues and be involved in many narrow escapes. The civil war ironclad was only used as a means to end the storyline of the plague. I liked the movie ""National Treasure"" a whole lot better. Even though the Indiana Jones movies had lots of fighting and shooting, they still were there to solve the mystery of the treasure first. ........",Sahara
429,waytansea27,Good but no Indiana Jones,7,10 April 2005,"I was went into this movie with it in my mind that it was part of a new breed of action/ adventure flicks, you know, something along the lines of a modern day Indiana Jones. Kind of like National Treasure. To my surprise the treasure/mystery seeking adventure thriller was more of a ""world is in severe danger"" movie. It is more like a weak version of Outbreak with some adventure thrown in to spice things up. I felt a little jipped because of the way the film took this turn but none the less it was a great viewing experience with a lot of suspense and action sequences. The film went wrong when they got sidetracked by its second plot (world-wide virus) and leaves the hidden ship to be stumbled upon while trying to save the world. The clues leading up to finding the ship are never uncovered but found along the way which severely downgrades the film. Overall though the film was fun, exciting, suspenseful, and enjoyable. Mathew McConahay plays an unexpectedly well and believable role as Dirk. Penelope Cruz's character Eva was a very basic role and could have easily been casted with just about any other actress and performed better. Steve Zahn's role added some needed and very well done comic relief and his presence with Matthew Conaughey make a perfect combo.Overall: Not what expected but an entertaining film well worth the admission price. Seeing Matthew Conaughey and Steve Zahn pair off with each other is reason enough to see this film.",Sahara
430,tony-766,Very Enjoyable,7,10 April 2005,"This is a very enjoyable movie. If your looking for superb plot. Look elsewhere. If your looking for a few good laughs, some fairly good action and the lovely Ms. Cruz, this is your movie.Steven Zahn virtually steals the movie as the trusty side kick. M. McConaughy does a decent enough job as Dirk Pit.This is not a four star, wow you out of your seats movie. But it is an enjoyable way to spend a Saturday afternoon. My wife even loved it!If your a big William H. Macy fan, he is in the movie, but not with any real part to play. Just set back, shovel in some popcorn and have a good time.",Sahara
431,spam-561,Flavorless Chewing Gum,3,11 April 2005,"Have you ever had a piece of gum that tasted so good for about 15 seconds and then you spent the rest of the time just chewing miserably until you finally spit it out? That is how I felt watching Sahara. The beginning of the movie pulled me in and I immediately sat back to enjoy a great adventure. Only to be disappointed as this movie dragged on and on with scenes that looked like they were made up on the go. I wish I could have gotten my money back. The acting was extremely weak but so was the script that they had to work from. The worst part was when you discover at the end of the movie that they want to make sequels which I hope to God are better than this movie. I guess the title of the sequels will be: ""Dirk Pitt and the Temple of Crap."" or some other Indiana Jones spin off since this movie was clearly an attempt to create a new adventure hero.",Sahara
432,daisy_kat,"not the same as the book, but very entertaining anyway!",10,11 April 2005,"Having just watched Sahara, I can understand the complaints that Cussler fans have about the movie not holding true to the book. However, that being said, it was still a very entertaining action movie. Casting was by no means perfect, and Steve Zahn playing what was supposed to be a short, caustic Italian was way off, but he was funny and downright silly (in a good way) throughout the movie. Matthew McConaughey was great in the role of Dirk Pitt, although I think they missed his sober, patriotic side completely. Cussler's Pitt was by no means a treasure hunter, but rather a true American hero. Penelope Cruz was there, and that's about it. William H. Macy is a great Admiral Sandecker although the role of Numa seemed to cast into a shadier light that is portrayed in the books.",Sahara
433,rotranscription,What a joke!,3,11 April 2005,"I felt pretty disappointed by the cheeziness of this film. I have read most of the Dirk Pitt series and was pretty shocked (in an excited way) to hear that a movie was coming out based on one of the books. When I saw who was to play Dirk and Al, I knew it was going to be a letdown, but I saw it anyway.I was really disappointed by the portrayal of many of the characters. They were goofy and did not seem too bright.I realize that the Cussler novels are meant for light, entertaining reading, but that does not mean that the film had to be so cheezy, seemingly low budgeted, and nonsensical as it was. Nothing was explained! I spent more time laughing at how ridiculous the movie was than wondering what was around the corner.In conclusion, although the movie seemed a joke to me I will still see the next Cussler-based film that comes out.",Sahara
434,jkevin20,Hollywood Can't Improve Books,5,11 April 2005,"I find it amazing that Hollywood cannot seem to stick to books and attempt to rewrite them to ""make them better"". The Sahara book had a unique ending but Hollywood changed it. The casting of Steve Zahn as Al Giordino was a joke. While he was entertaining for comic relief, he in no shape or form resembles the Al Giordino (Italian muscle) that is Dirk Pitt's partner.Dirk Pitt is a USAF academy graduate in the book but a Navy SEAL in the movie. Matthew McConaughey is plausible as a Navy SEAL but Steve Zahn,... I'm sorry.. it makes me laugh so hard. He would have probably washed out during the first physical. Admiral Sandecker and Rudi Gunn were pretty much the way that I would picture them except Rudi would not be so cowardly.Overall the action was entertaining but I see why most of the critics are ripping it apart. It was definitely better than ""Raise the Titanic"" which was another Hollywood rewrite but a long way from the suspenseful action packed books by Clive Cussler.I've all of the Dirk Pitt adventures and Hollywood should sit down and read them before attempting to make a movie about them. Did they read the same ""Sahara"" book that I read? Cussler wrote a lot better than the hacks that rewrote this screenplay.Clive Cussler and Tom Clancy need to take more control over the screenplay of their novels or they will lose a lot of fans. Naturally, I would like to see some of their books turned into films but only if the authors kept the screenplays much closer to the books. Authors write books and screenplays are written by author-wannabes. That is the main reason books will always be better than the films.",Sahara
435,CajunGag,Great Book - Good Movie,6,11 April 2005,"Like any Cussler fan, while half way through one of Clive's novels, I just keeping hoping they'll make a movie of it. Then by the end of the novel I hope they don't make a movie of it. A few year's back I spoke to someone at NUMA and was informed of the movie. During Super Bowl, I saw the ad. I couldn't wait to April. I knew it could never live up to the book but I was glad anyway. I always thought that Tom Sellick would be the perfect Dirk. I queers he got a little old for the part. OK the movie. I was impressed during the opening scene. When the Confederate ship stopped mid stream I held my breath and waited for the mystery prisoner to appear. It didn't happen. I still enjoyed the movie as did my 13 year old son. Putting half of the content of the book into the movie would have been too much for the public to handle. Unfortunately Hollywood caters to the 13-16 year old viewer and they would have been lost & confused. Would love to see Deep Six, Cyclops or Dragon. Hope Yaeger & Max make the next one if there is one....",Sahara
436,cusslerfan1979,Story altered but great flick,8,11 April 2005,"As a fan of Clive Cussler I was pretty excited when I heard this movie was being made. I went to see the movie with only two hopes. First that I wouldn't be disappointed as I was with Hollywood's poor attempt at ""Raise The Titanic"". And secondly as a loyal fan of Mr Cussler's books (I have them all and read them all) joy at finally seeing Dirk, Al, Rudi, and Sandecker all come to life.I was not disappointed. The film makers did rearrange the story a bit (treasure hunters instead of the research scientists), Sandecker retired (not in his usual office at NUMA). They omitted a few details from the book (such as Lincoln being on the Texas and Kitty Mancock the pilot of the plane, and of course the scene in the book where the author himself appears) but overall I just LOVED this movie. It was packed with action and the chemistry between Dirk/Al was fantastic. I feel that all the actors played their respective parts great and it is my sincere hope that we will get to see these characters again.",Sahara
437,joshoramandarose,"Enjoyable, but not a must see.",6,11 April 2005,"I have always enjoyed adventure movies like Indiana Jones or The Mummy trilogy, and this movie fills that basic craving. While it is not as good as the before mentioned titles, it does have enough action and humor to entertain you, or at least me, for a two hour period. I particularly liked the characters played by what I call second string actors. They played their parts well and portrayed believable characters. The action sequences were entertaining and well done, as well as the special effects. One of the neater things about this movie is the music transitions from scene to scene, Once you see it, you will understand what I mean. As far as the humor goes, It didn't make me laugh out loud often, however I did notice a smile on my face for a better portion of the film. I thought this film was better than National Treasure, and I thought National Treasure was decent.",Sahara
438,vpang,The theme is not clear enough for the audience,5,14 April 2005,"First I would like to say that the action sequence in this movie is very good. But the theme of the movie is not clear for the audience at all.I would like to include the plot of the movie here as little as possible. But I just want to point out that this movie do not have a clear theme to link all the action sequence together. First, it try to tell us that it is a treasure hunting movie by showing us a lot of historical sequence of the treasure. But at the middle of the movie it tells us that there is a plague in Africa to be cure. And then there is a chemical plant that cause the plague. After all these I just felt that the movie has loss its focus on treasure hunting and switch the focus to environmental protection.I think an adventure film should stick to the point that it started, because we never saw ""Indiana Jones"" goes to cure a plague or destroy a chemical plant in the middle of his treasure hunting.",Sahara
439,jarro-2783,Brilliant Movie,8,15 April 2005,"I thought this was a brilliant movie full of good old action interspersed with some good comedy. I think there has been a lack of good entertainment in movies lately, Sahara brings back the entertainment without needing bad language every five minutes. With only four swear words in the whole movie it satisfied this criteria very well. Sahara had quite a few funny moments, along with the good action this made Sahara very enjoyable. The plot was well thought out, I thought the plot was almost believable. There was no corniness in the plot like in other movies. The write built up the suspense very well. I was captured for the whole movie and wanted to know what happened next. I would see it again if I was given the chance. Sahara was one of the better movies I have seen lately with good clean entertainment. I look forward to more of what Sahara's director can bring us.",Sahara
440,wolfewriter,Very good!,10,16 April 2005,"One point: suspension of disbelief is part of watching movies. Understandably, some things in the movie were a bit stretched or glossed over, but that's true to some extent in all movies, including Indiana Jones. This movie made me laugh, made me cry, and made me determined to buy the film when it's available on DVD. My husband who was not really expecting to be entertained, thinking of Sahara as a ""chick flick"" because of the leading actor, laughed as hard as I did,and even my 14-year-old step-daughter was rolling! Great music, great comedy, some fun action scenes, and even a storyline to go with it! For 2 hours and $8 per ticket, I can't think of a better way to spend a Sunday afternoon!",Sahara
441,camkg-1,A True Cussler Fan's Opinion,7,16 April 2005,"Let me lay the groundwork first. I have been reading Cussler's books since I was in high school. I have read them all and reread them. I am a firm believer of Cussler's underlying theme in his books of preserving maritime heritage for not only is it the history of America, it is the history of man. And I am the proud owner of Doxa Sub 300T #148. So it is safe to say that there are no bigger Cussler fans than myself.I am not gonna get into the plot cause I want people to see it for themselves and even read the book before or after. Just in short, Dirk Pitt, save the world, gets the girl (and the car) and makes me want to head for the ocean in search of adventure. Just like every Cussler book I have readAnd as a Cussler fan I have to say that I really enjoyed this movie and its the first movie I have seen in some time that I can say that. The book is action and adventure. It is a race against time to save humanity, it is a search for a lost piece of the past. And so is this movie. A lot of Cussler fans have dissed this movie because it is not true to form to the book. That it did not get into the minutia (spelling??) of Cussler's book. That some subplots were left out and the characters not quite right.Well yes and I am glad for that. I enjoyed Cussler's book a lot and, in fact, am rereading it now. But folks you cant get every detail from a book into a movie version. Otherwise you would be sitting in that theater for so long your backside will forget its attached to your body. A big shocker here people, and I am talking to my fellow Cussler fans who have snubbed this movie, the first James Bond movies, Gone With The Wind, To Kill A Mockingbird, and even Cussler's literary competition Tom Clancy's HUNT FOR RED October didn't have everything in the movie that were in the books. But the movies were still great.McConaughey, Zahn and Macy had me worried at first when I heard they would play the main characters, but they surprised me and pleased me. Could there have been some things that could have made the movie better?? OF COURSE But my god people, its been 25 years since we have seen Dirk Pitt on the screen and I am glad its happened and I hope, pray, for another movie and my vote goes for TREASURE. Hey, its worth the time, its worth the money. Any comments or any thoughts email them my way and lets discuss it. But for now, Indiana Jones is too legendary to keep going, Jack Ryan's day is done, lets give Dirk, Al and the crew a chance to hit us with new action.....",Sahara
442,jcoppoletta-1,"Great movie, a must see",9,17 April 2005,"I am an avid fan of Clive Cussler and have read all of his books. I think Matthew, Steve and William Macy played their characters to perfection. They may not have fit the exact description of the characters in looks, but they definitely nailed the personalities. They did not stay true to the book to the word, but in spirit they did. I really enjoyed the movie. If they had stayed to the book, it would have been 3 hours and had to have a sequel to finish it. That was the biggest downfall of Lord of the Rings. They stayed to true to the book, way to long and lots of boring parts. The only thing I think they need to change is Rudi Gunn's character, he is not a wimp. They definitely need a better leading lady as well, Penelope sucks. I hope they make more movies with Matthew, Steve and William playing their parts, and turn Rudi into a real man.",Sahara
443,norton740,"A waste of $130M and more importantly, my $10.",1,29 April 2005,"Where to start.... The trailer shows you all that you need to see of the movie. There is nothing left beyond that. The story is full of holes and impossible scenarios. A movie can only ask an intelligent person to suspend disbelief so far. I understand that this is not intended to be a cerebral film. But for God's sake, this isn't porn. There must be a relatively plausible storyline.Matthew McConaughey is not, nor will ever be, Harrison Ford. The attempt to make him out to be the next major action star is a waste of studio money. As of 4/24, the movie is $80 million (gross) below the cost of producing this masterpiece. Hopefully, the lesson is learned and Matthew can go back to doing back flips across the UT end zone for attention.If you plan on seeing the film solely for Matthew McConaughey's upper torso, this is the tour de force you were looking for. Otherwise, rent Spice World or Son of the Mask, or better yet find a good indie flick.",Sahara
444,andymack6,Action/Adventure,6,17 April 2005,"If a quirky,pacey adventure movie with a plot full of holes, then this is one for you. It has a great opening sequence and the locations look great. One of the major plus points this movie is that it has a great soundtrack. Unfortunately it is let down by the lack of charm from the leading man and one dimensional villains. It's also one of those movies where everything is all too convenient.Some of the exchanges between Dirk and the comedy sidekick are well played, but in all the film sounds like it hasn't been thought through fully.I'd recommend turning the thought centre's in your brain to low and just relax and enjoy the film for what it is, a Saturday afternoon family adventure for those who aren't fussy when it comes to logic",Sahara
445,mgopilot,First Class Adventure,10,17 April 2005,"I loved the book and have it in hardback. I'm a real Clive Cussler fan. It captures the essence of the book without all of the subplots, but enough to make 2 hours of great adventure. Mathew McConaughey is perfect as Dirk Pitt (his hair is darkened), and their is a great cast camaraderie. The story is of a long lost ironclad, biohazard horror, corruption, and African civil war in the desert. Even if you didn't read the book, it is just as good or better than the Last Crusade and Jones. That is all I can say without spoiling the story. Penelope Cruz is very good, and so is Zahn as Al Giordino, even though he doesn't have black curled hair and a build like Hercules as per the book character. Macy is great as Admiral Sandecker. The subplots left out don't take away from the over-all adrenaline adventure and fun. The changes made reduce the length it would have been by 1/2 hour at least, but do not hurt the movie at all--in fact are great. I can't wait for more of Mathew McConaughey and the rest of the NUMA cast to make another Clive Cussler Dirk Pitt Adventure come to life. The director and screenwriter did a good job, and Clive should be proud of what they achieved. A rousing adventure, as is the book!",Sahara
446,citizencook,The only time...,1,21 April 2005,"My girlfriend and I went to see Sahara expecting an Indiana Jones / National Treasure type film. After watching 1 hour of this terrible film we both left the cinema. This is the only time I have left during a film. The characters were forgettable, the speedboat scene was ridiculous (how did they get a job as henchmen if they cant fire a gun???) and... well not a lot more happened than that. The idea was quite good but the story just ambles along at such a slow pace that you lose interest in the Characters and the plot. It also seemed strange that they were a team of expert divers but there wasn't even any underwater scenes in the first hour. There was no suspense or excitement that kept you interested. I cant give an accurate comment on this film as I only saw the first hour but I couldn't bear watching another hour of such a drab film. :(",Sahara

I mean if the author is trying to sue the movie company ....does this not ring any bells here ?????This movie had huge potential as the Dirk Pitt adventures were the American equivalent of Ian Flemings James Bond. But to everyones great dismay the movie plot and characters were as weak as the dialog. If they had gotten this right then it may have been a huge cash cow like the modern day James Bonds have become - however a plethora of poor directing , poor acting and the worst script possible have culminated in a cringe making 1 and a half hours ..... shame on you Hollywood. I'm a great fan of Clive Cussler, and would like to warn any would be fans out there....DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!!!",Sahara

While the setting was realistically updated to reflect the present, there was too much of the plot line that was disjointed and contrived. In one scene the main characters come upon the solar plant in the desert and suddenly decide to jump on a train and gain entry into the plant. Very little background to even point to the plant for any reason.They jump on in plain daylight in the middle of nowhere and are not seen? The film has little in common with the Book by the same author and the film jumbles the story line tremendously. Anyone who knows the Dirk Pitt novels knows the NUMA is a government agency but until the end of the film it is a private organization like that run by Clive Cussler in real life. In the novel Pitt doesn't even find out about the Texas until a third of the way through the novel. The film has that as the prime motive of the storyline. Althogether, a very unsatisfactory film for fans of Clive Cussler and Dirk Pitt.",Sahara
449,harryandrhonda,Implausability taken to new heights,2,24 April 2005,I really tried to like this film. I have always been a fan of Steve Zahn and have been looking forward to a good Matthew McConaughey feature for some time. The film just finally wore me out. At every turn the audience is required to accept implausible events and amazing coincidences that border on the impossible. The river chase scene is one of a string of these incredible events. We are asked to accept the good fortune of the good guys in overcoming a small fleet of gun boats in their bosses yacht. If one of the thousands of rounds fired at the yacht had hit the hull is would have sunk. By the outrageously silly end of the film I found myself actually watching it with my hand covering my face.Others seemed to enjoy it but it was just too stupid for me.,Sahara

If the US wants to feel ""superior"" or ""proud"" or ""brave"" or ""strong"" and ""oh so funny"", it's jurisdiction must also. International viewers, and those within the US with international empathies, can certainly watch these types of movies, as long as the subject of these adjectives remains squarely within the confines of the US dominion itself. Once you try to apply these ideas to other countries - well you get 'Sahara'. The idea of a ""let you mind go free"" movie is fine; just leave old-fashioned racist views out of it! And let's face it - there is a lot of geographical US subject matter to keep these important epithets alive.",Sahara

I did enjoy the movie, and will buy the DVD when it is available, but I just had a couple of ""personal feeling niggles"" about it. Firstly, I don't think the casting was a 100% success. As a dedicated reader of the novels, I have mental images of Dirk Pitt as a slightly older (40ish), less flamboyant character. Al Giordino in my mind is a 50ish short, wide, muscular Italian character. Admiral Sandecker is a more late 60ish, more military type of character, running the show from his desk.My second criticism is the soundtrack, I did not feel that some of the music played ""gelled"" with the storyline, and seemed quite out of place.However, as I said, personal impressions only, and I'll still be buying the movie to watch many more times at home. Can't wait for the next one !",Sahara

However, if, like me, you grew up on Indiana Jones and you love the thrill of adventure with quite a bit of good humour mixed in, then go see Sahara!As a book it was good, with enough thrills and mystery to keep you glued to your seat for however long it took you to finish it, but as a film is a great piece of cinematic devilry with Pitt and Giordino brought to life pretty much perfectly.Indeed, the only thing I have a minor issue with is the casting of Rudi Gunn, (I think he should be shorter and have a little pointy beard) but that's just a personal thing that I got from the Pitt series of adventure novels. Bring on the rest of them! If Bond can survive for twenty-odd films, Pitt's 14 adventures should be no hassle.",Sahara
453,wilson-travel,Good action but bad script,4,28 April 2005,"SAHARA is one of those movies that was basically OK, but with better writing it could have been great. There were so many implausible ""holes"" in the script that they completely made the essence of the movie SAHARA junk. The concept that a Conferderate ironclad could make it from the eastern coast of the US to some interior African river, is at totally at odds with with the realities of what those vessels could do. Plus there was never any real explanation why the Confederates were going to Africa with the cargo that they were carrying. I did like the buddy chemistry between the two male characters (Dirk and Al), and Cruz as the doctor added another dimension to the story. One thing that I did like about this movie, all the the characters were capable individuals. Dirk (Matthew McConaughey) and AL (Steve Zahn) showed at least some realism in their combat scene at the well.In short I enjoyed SAHARA, but believe if the movie had been based more on reality it could have been a far more enjoyable movie",Sahara

Sahara did not disappoint. I found it not only action and adventure packed but flippant and funny. I thought the acting was fine--what were you expecting-something like Schindler's List or the Pianist? This isn't meant to offer eternal truths, touch hearts, or possibly not even be all that memorable. But what it does do is entertain, and it does a darn good job at it.It doesn't take itself too seriously, and you shouldn't either.Enjoy, I did. *munch*",Sahara
456,steveharris66,Dreadful!!!!,1,29 December 2005,A ridiculously waste of talented actors in a storyline that makes a Simpsons episode look sophisticated and believable. A dog of a film. A suspenseful opening scene (past) passing on to an interesting modern setting degenerate into high farce that is is not even good enough to show us that it is poking fun at itself. These are class actors who have some fun but are unable to take us along for the ride with a script that would look better on the bottom of a birdcage. They should have spent less on the publicity and hype and employed a few 2nd graders to rework the plot - it could not have got any worse.

I am already seeing things that I wish they had left in the movie, or hadn't changed in the movie. I'm glad I saw the movie first. But if you don't mind that it's not the book, it's a pretty good movie. I also noticed that there is another woman that is going to be a main character in the book that isn't even in the movie, or is and was in it so briefly that I don't remember her. I have never understood either why they change peoples appearances so much from the books descriptions. The Dr. has long red brown hair in the book, well, those of you that have watched the movie or know who plays her, in the movie she has black hair. They seemed to get Dirk pretty close though!

We were all pleasantly surprised! There are problems that keep this from being in the best movie ever category, but if you are capable of suspending disbelief and simply enjoying well played characters using unbelievable methods to get themselves out of sticky situations and doing it all with effortless banter, this is the movie for you. The relationships worked, the style was fun and the soundtrack did a great job of setting moods.Upon leaving the theater I realized I had laughed and winced throughout the whole movie and had a thoroughly enjoyable time. Amazingly enough, I have plans to see this again with friends whom I know would love its ""out there"" premise told in a laid back style that doesn't take itself to seriously while avoiding crossing the line into total camp.My advice is leave the cynicism home and give yourself permission to take a night off and just enjoy the camaraderie and the scenery with a few explosions along the way for good measure. Steve Zahn proves once again the importance of a really good side-kick. He can take much of the credit for this unbelievable romp being so entertaining.As a final note on the film, I loved the poetic justice dealt out to the rather stereo-typical villain in the end.

I can understand editing some details that do not require explanation save in book format. Sahara however could have been so much better and deserved a better treatment. I would not expect a true to the letter transfer of book to movie format but come on! The actors and producers of this shoddy muck stained pile of rotten pig guts are total flops, if only because they made no effort to do the book or its characters or plot justice.The producer of this tripe obviously bowed to ignorance and arrogance and demonstrated a lack of appreciation for the characters or the plot from the book.Matthew McConaughey has no talent in acting, demonstrating only that he often comes off as an overly eager jack terrier at the sight of a dogbone. His enthusiasm was overkill and destroyed any dignity of the character he was portraying. I wanted to and still want to slap the snot out of him. Any director and producer with half a brain could have given the book proper justice.

Seriously when I read these comments I thought to myself ""are these people for real?"". Take for example the Indy movies... you are not going to tell me that they were logical and realistic are you? This movie of this type of genre is of course going to be unrealistic, fun, humorous and filled with action and adventure. If you are looking for realistic and logical don't watch movies... sheesh unbelievable. I said my 2 cents. Oh and by the way this movie was a lot of fun!

I have never seen him before, but I will definitely watch for him in other movies. And Matthew M. was good also. But there were a lot of things that didn't make any sense at all. Like the time the guys were handcuffed to the back of the truck. They slid the box off the truck (that was only held on by 2 screws) and they had to slide it off between the guy looking back to check on them. Well don't you think that once they got it off the truck that since they were looking back every 2 minutes to check on them that they would notice them being gone & come back for them???",Sahara

465,DrMayhem7,"It was good, if you have not read the book.",6,11 July 2006,"Within the past few years I have got addicted to Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt novels. Two movies have been made from the books and they were both not what they could be. I read Sahara not long before I heard there was a movie and it came out a few months after I finished the book. Now here is the point, as with most books turned to movies, they do not come out well just like this one. In the book, the Civil War ship is not what they are looking for, they stumble upon it. Also in the book is more in-depth look at everything. There are key events that happen to some of the people that got left out and other things got changed around. The way I look at it, they changed it around with them trying to find the so called ""ship of death"" and stumbling into the other part in the movie when it was the opposite in the book. The characters did not even match that well. Al Giordino is supposed to be a short muscular man with very broad shoulders unlike what he appeared to be in the movie which was kind of wimpy looking actually. I would truly suggest reading the book over seeing the movie because Clive Cussler does such a great job on his novels that a movie based on one probably won't compare.",Sahara

There were things that never took place and parts that should have been there that were totally missing or altered beyond all recognition. Neither Dirk or Al looked much like depicted in the books, however Sandecker was close if a little thin.Taking the fact that I had read the book out it was a passable effort at an action adventure, which was much better than the only previous try at one of Clives books - Raise the Titanic (1980) which prompted him to say never would another film be made of his books, this time sadly he will mean it!

Matthew McConaughey (with his irritating dialect)is simply unable to be a good actor. The only reason for his presence in the movie is that he is considered to be handsome or what. Yet, there is one good thing in this film: the director could choose a good partner for M.M.: Penelope Cruz. She is just as untalented as M.M., therefore they make a really good couple in the movie. I've never heard about Breck Eisner who directed this 'film', but I am quite sure that I'll never hear about him again. Some scenes contained somethings that (I guess) the makers of this movie found humorous, but no one laughed in the cinema, so I think that I was not the only one who did not get these 'funny things'.

The main character never seems to get the viewers into the movie. He is too busy with his treasure hunt he doesn't care about what happens to him or his pals. and his sidekick buddy is very annoying with his lame acting and grade 1 words to go with it. and the very last the caring doctor who is retarded just never seems to know what she is doing... horrible horrible movie.... the movie has some good action and a mindless story to go with it. if there are people who are mindless enough to waste their money on the DVD have to be pretty dumb and even renting this movie is a crime. i recommend donating your money to the Salvation Army instead at least it will help the African people unlike the movie.Please don't waste your money.,Sahara
469,escape_society,The Fall of Film Making,1,5 October 2005,"This movie is living proof that the world of good movies is ending. Watching this whole movie I instantly went into a sort of numbness like a shot of novocaine to my temple. I watched it from front to back, listened to every word, and still, gained nothing from it besides looking at the clock and saying ""I should have challenged my insomnia one more time instead of watching this"". I can't believe this movie. It's the film form of the art you buy at Safeway, an insult to every other piece of art ever made. An extra push in the fall of film making when it has already started its decent thanks to the whores in Hollywood. This movie makes life seem pointless. I felt like less of a human after watching it, like my life had zero meaning and I fell into a deep depression. Don't watch this movie, you will lose all faith in the world of film, because it's proof that making good movies again is a battle we can't win. I'm the symbol of the American public, I am what Hollywood is out to impress (or, as of now, out to trick and cheat). I say the world falls flat because a film like this proves that nobody cares about us under that huge LA sign, they want the money, not the entertainment. Maybe there are a few directors and producers in big budget land that give a damn, but I have seen nothing to prove it other then E! telling me they care. Movies have become so bad it's almost like one must put on special glasses to enjoy them, by endlessly looking for the good-points in every film, rather then just accepting the whole piece as a whole. I wouldn't do that to any other medium of art, and I won't do it for film. This isn't to say I need cigarette smoke floating through a black and white screen, but I do notice when I am looking through the eyes of somebody shooting the movie, and they are saying ""this is a good shot"" and not ""the masses will like this shot"". Think if every director took his time with every movie making it his perfect vision. Think how much every movie would be better. No longer would there be a ""B-Class"", every movie would be forced to move up a level because they can't compete with how good everything else is. Lucky for them, there is no bar right now. Anything goes, if it looks shiny, it must be great. Movies like this should not exist, but in this time and place, I am glad it does, because I pray it will inspire a new generation of Hollywood to stand up and say""What are we doing?!?!!"" Go ahead, watch this film. I did, and I hated it. If there was an area on IMDb where you could talk about film making as a whole, I would bring my argument on whether the Hollywooders want to entertain you or rape you there. But as it is, I see this as the place to talk about it because I see this movie as the anti-Christ of movie making. The living proof of a failing art form. I love well-made movies. That doesn't mean big budget, that means you can see that the people who made it want to entertain you more then just for that 2 hour duration. That doesn't mean everything must have a bigger meaning, it just means the story is more worth while then what's going on, on screen. Clive Cusslergood for him, bad for us, I have not read his books, but if he sees this as a good representation of them, I don't plan on it. Mindless movies can be fun, I enjoy a good sit down with some friends and laugh at a cheesy movie, but there is a difference between Toxic Avenger 4 and Alone in the Dark as I'm sure you will agree in terms of what makes a ""good cheesy movie"". This movie falls in the ""I don't even like to think about what the 50 million spent on this movie could have done to better the world"". Had this been a low budget flick, I would have laughed and said ""Not bad, better then I could have done with a camera"". Unfortunately, this movie was made, directed, stared and produced by people who couldn't give 2 *beep* about what you think about the movie, they were trained to make a movie this way, and they do it well. Long as you spent the $9 to go see it, they can still buy their kids that 2 million-dollar pony they want as their 3rd birthday present this year. Movies like this hold better directors and many different kinds of filmmakers back from the spotlight they deserve because they can't even get a finger in the limelight. In conclusion: Watch this movie if you want to see what the people who make movies think about your intellect. If you know this already, put it in the pile of reasons we should burn Hollywood to the ground, and start all over again.",Sahara

The plot jogs along at a fair pace and is all great fun, but there are times when the fact that several critical plot elements from the book have been deleted from the UK version makes the film very weak and more superficial than it needs. The appearance of an old aeroplane in the middle of the desert just when our heroes need transport, with no explanation, combined with the missing links to President Lincoln from the original excellent Clive Cussler story, appear to have been missed or saved for the US version (What is that all about-give UK viewers a break !)

I never really wanted to see it, but my little brother dragged me to it. Actually, I think that it was just a mistake about releasing it so soon to when they had released National Treasure. It gave people too much time to see National Treasure and assume that it was going to be identical. Don't get me wrong, I loved National Treasure, but this movie was really good too. There were lots of big explosions and fast paced chases. The locations the movie was shot in was beautiful, there were some great dessert shots. I really liked the plot of the movie, it did seem a little like Indiana Jones and National Treasure, but all Action/Adventure movies tend to follow a lot of the same lines. Matthew McConaughey and Steve Zahn made a great team and I hope to see them do another movie together, and Penélope Cruz is an amazing actress.

Granted, I didn't expect great things from it, but considering the amount of time it took to film, I expected something at least partially wholesome.Nope.The movie seems to be approached by the actors as comical, rather than action-packed. The stunts that were included were pathetic, not at all well performed... the romance between the two leads was incredibly predictable... frankly I couldn't wait for the film to be over.And what got me the most, is when the characters were out in the desert, one expects to hear ethnic, kind of African music. I'm not saying that directors should always go with what is expected, but at least provide something that fits the scene. Stereotypical North American music was played through out the movie, (I believe Sweet Home Alabama emerged some where?) and it didn't add to the film AT ALL.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, save yourself and don't go see it.",Sahara

I've seen a lot of adaptations of books to movies but this was an embarrassment to Mr. Cussler and his books. The characters were awful {Al/Rudi) not even close. Dirk was more like a playboy and sure did not act like he had any SEAL training. Sandecker was not to bad. The plot jumped all over and a lot important issues were omitted (Lncoln and Amelia Eirhart). I hope Mr.Cussler does'not lose faith in getting his books adapted to the screen. Next time get a director who knows what he is doing and get someone who has actually read a novel or two to cast the movie.,Sahara
474,gnews-1,Not Indiana Jones,2,7 September 2005,"To compare this with Raiders of the Lost Ark, one of the best movies of all time, is laughable. Yes, they are both action/adventure and you have to go with a few things, but the plot makes no sense in Sahara. I went in wanting to like this movie, but it wasn't just the river chase scene or the ironclad shooting down a helicopter that got me; it was the poorly conceived screenplay. We're led to believe from the beginning that this Civil War ship, the Texas, will be intricately weaved into the plot, yet halfway through the movie, the ship doesn't matter anymore. And then our heroes just happen to stumble upon the ship for no apparent reason other than to shoot down a dictator flying a helicopter. Again, why and how did the ship come to Africa? And how does toxic waste multiply when it hits the ocean and envelope the world? The stunts in Lost Ark may not be plausible, but they're much better done, more entertaining and more germane to the plot. And the plot in Raiders of the Lost Ark, which should have won Best Picture in 1981, is as tightly wound as you'll find in any movie of any genre. Sahara is all over the place; it's haphazardly put together, and the acting is second rate (another point where Sahara merits no comparison to Indy. C'mon, Matthew McConaughey vs. Harrison Ford, Penelope Cruz vs. Karen Allen -- you've got to be kidding!) And how about playing Sweet Home Alabama and an endless string of 70s hits throughout the movie? What's up with that? Again, before you compare this to Indiana Jones, you might want to listen to John Williams' Oscar winning score. Indy is a work of art, lighthearted as it may be -- Sahara is a cheap, but expensive imitation.",Sahara
475,genafefa,Not as cheesy as it looks,7,1 December 2005,"I expected nothing from this movie and was pleasantly surprised, even refreshed. All of the characters had a reason to be where they were, even the female character. Her mission is actual more compelling than the lead's. The sidekick, Al (Steve Zahn), is not just a buddy along for the ride. It's clear that the lead wouldn't be able to do what he does without him. Beside, Zahn is just damn funny.It didn't require my full capacity to suspend disbelief, which was especially refreshing and left mental reserves to actually appreciate the characters and story.I was pleased to recognize drum rhythms that were actually from Nigeria and Mali. Indigenous music enhanced the adventure of by taking us there. The locations were filled out, and not just a backdrop for the action.Go ahead and watch it. It's not as cheesy as it looks.",Sahara
476,t_funny_tr,Nothing Interesting except Penélope Cruz she always rocks!!,5,1 October 2005,"Nothing interesting in the movie. Very absurd, nonsense story and silly jokes. The excitement and action increases a little bit after the middle of the movie Most parts of the movie is boring especially the first half.It doesn't make you feel anything love, sorrow, excitement, horror, mystery etc.. Even the chasing and other action scenes doesn't excite you. only the scene when they fix the plane and sail with it in the desert really makes you laugh!!Nothing else interesting at all. But if you are a Penelope Cruz fan like me you I advice you to see this movie just because of her. But if you want other Penelope Cruz movies watch Vanilla Sky, FanFan, Women On Top, etc she always rocks. She is the best!! This movie has good casting but bad story and director could be much better with a higher quality story and better director to make you feel some feeling especially mystery excitement and love.",Sahara
477,amiejenkinson,Better Than Bond,10,30 September 2005,"I really enjoyed this movie.Its not intellectual but its not based on an intellectual book.The cast are good and Mcconaughey and Zahn have a real sense of rapport which makes up for ZXahn not resembling the character in the books.He also has a personality as does Rudi Gunn ( the books characters are cyphers who exist only to serve Pitt).Cinematography is excellent and the locations are well used.Music and original score are evocative and fun, the set pieces are excellent and unlike recent entries in the Bond franchise this retains its sense of fun.Excellent..I recommend this",Sahara
478,chad-morris,James Bond meets Indiana Jones gone bad!!!!,5,13 October 2005,"The film has a good core story line, but the assembly lacks a little. The final scene is a combination of Thunder heart and XXX. After so much effort and $$$ was spent to create an epic film, I do not understand why the screen writers felt like taking this story and turning it into a sci-fi historical spoof. The director combined complex medical and scientific material and added three stooges ""hey I lost my favorite hat"" gags with John Wayne's bullet proof body armor. I was not sure which part of my mind to activate or deactivate to enjoy the film. Perhaps they could have asked John Woo to edit the film and serve it up as grey goo for folks with no active cerebral function. Sorry for seeming negative, I just had high hopes. This is a good rental for a cold day, and simi-mindless entertainment.",Sahara
479,jlauk,"Mindless, poor mans Indiana Jones",3,16 October 2005,"The first time I've felt inclined to submit a review for a DVD. This was recommended by the guy in my local rental store, and it's the last time I take his./their word for it! Rubbish on so many levels, derivative of Indiana Jones, so many plot holes, totally unlikely premise. Looks good, and has a high-budget appearance, but the actors (who have probably been in better things) struggle to make anything of a lame script. And I guess my instincts should have warned me off when Cruz was in it. In it's defence, the scenery is good, as is the soundtrack, but it's depiction of African culture and it's people (""nobody cares about Africa"") is dumb and offensive. IMHO, avoid :-)",Sahara
480,purplejoy,Exciting and fun,10,4 January 2006,"I have to admit, I had not heard of Sahara before today. (Why was that I wonder?) I rented the DVD tonight and was quite pleasantly surprised by the entire movie. It was fun, well-done, and well thought out. It was obvious that much complex detail went into making the movie a success by a seeming army of people. I particularly enjoyed the combination of Steve Zahn and Matthew McConaughey. They would not have been a duo I would have thought of, but seemed to have a very apt chemistry that worked. Overall, I really enjoyed this movie and would highly recommend it. If I were trying to place it within a genre and compare it within that genre, I would place it within the genre of epic adventure movies such as the Indiana Jones series and would note that it is equal in scope and success.",Sahara
481,kettisha,hilarious,8,2 August 2021,"This is a hilarous funny movie, you have to have a great sense of humour to watch this. Love the visual effects of the water and the surrounding landscapes. Personally i think Steve makes this movie...",Sahara

483,dennis-goldsmith,"Started off good, then took a nose-dive.",3,15 July 2009,"The beginning of the movie was great, and the premise was something that I was sure would keep my interest. Towards the end, however (at least, I think it was the end, since I shut it off at this point) it got downright cheesy and turned into an obnoxious cliché of a wannabe action movie. Matthew McConaughey as some kind of elite ex-navy seal is incredibly hard to swallow, although Steve Zahn did provide some enjoyable comic relief.Overall, it was a terrible movie. It tried to do what Indiana Jones and other such movies have done, and failed miserably. I liked Fool's Gold much better, and I hated Fool's Gold.",Sahara
484,Flyingtigr,One of the worst of the year,1,20 February 2006,"I really do not understand how someone who has viewed this movie can give it as many as 8, 9, or 10 stars. I originally had low expectations, but then saw that Ebert and Roeper gave it thumbs up, so I figured it was at least a little better than I had originally thought. Nope, gut instinct was right.It starts out OK with the Civil War flashback, but this sequence is never followed up with any other flashback or explanation of any kind. It is totally ridiculous to think that an Ironclad could have travelled across the ocean without swamping. They said so in the movie several times. Not to mention that there would not have been enough coal or provisions on board to make such a journey.This is just the biggest of a huge amount of ridiculous plot holes and stupid writing. I really don't need to describe every one do I? I can not believe some have compared this to Indiana Jones. That is like comparing a Yugo and a Cadillac. The action sequences do not come close to any Indiana Jones movie, or any Road Runner cartoon for that matter. I have seen and enjoyed many many movies where you have to suspend your sense of plausibility including Batman Begins and National Treasure.Save your money, but more importantly, save your valuable time and stay away from this movie.",Sahara
485,judith_montplaisir,You want to see what Team America: World Police was laughing at?,1,28 February 2006,"Honestly, it was so awful that I couldn't stop laughing. When you watch this kind of movie, you tell yourself: ""Do they really think I'm that stupid?"". I could almost hear ""America! F*** Yeah!"".Matthew McConaughey and Penelope Cruz are not bad actors, but the characters are poor and we don't feel anything for them. Actually, we don't feel anything at all.The positive sides of this movie is that everything is so predictable, you can watch it while doing something else. It's also a good remedy if you are insomniac.Finally, if you are searching for a good movie, this is not for you.",Sahara
486,dickonastring,Vaguely entertaining rubbish,1,2 March 2006,"Another poor attempt of Hollywood to portray Americans as saviours of the mankind, while taking a swipe at French and trying to appear environmentally friendly at the same time.Expect cliché after cliché and token characters throughout the film. Actors do not perform convincing - it makes the fact that this is just ""bread on the table"" in wait for some decent roles, even more obvious. Action highlights of the film will make Intuitor people frown in horror, as physics has been defiled beyond recognition.I must say that I felt quite relieved when the film finally finished, however, it felt disappointing that I have wasted time over such a mediocrity.Here is a formula of this film: Top Gun + Red Scorpion + (Indiana Jones - action - plot - creativity).",Sahara
