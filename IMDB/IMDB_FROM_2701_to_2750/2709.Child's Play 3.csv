0,TheLittleSongbird,Chucky comes stalking,5,13 December 2018,"While it is not my favourite genre, there is an appreciation for the horror genre. Mainly watched 'Child's Play 3' having decided to recently watch and review all the films in the 'Child's Play'/Chucky series, having been intrigued for a long time by Chucky's horror icon status, a deserved distinction.Do feel that the character himself is better than the films. The 'Child's Play'/Chucky films are very variable, with the first film being by far the best. None of the sequels are as good, though don't consider them unwatchable. 'Child's Play 3' has been deemed one of the, sometimes the, worst in the series. For me it is definitely the worst of the initial trilogy and although the title for worst is debatable it is a lesser one to me.There are faults in 'Child's Play 3'. The story is predictable with no originality and too much of it is complete nonsense. Aside from with Chucky, the dialogue is really cheesy and with two exceptions the acting is lacking, Justin Whalin being especially annoying. The romance was a pointless distraction, there seemingly to pad out time, and a few of the characters behave idiotically.Like the second film there is a rushed feel here, there is a sense of a relatively tight budget (although the film looks good still) and even tighter time constraints. Also felt that whereas the first 'Child's Play' avoided going the cheesy, goofy and formulaic route that it could easily have done considering the premise, 'Child's Play 3' did feel formulaic and too much of it failed to escape the unintentionally.However, 'Child's Play 3' looks slick and suitably ominous and the special effects don't disappoint, they blend very well, look eerily life-like and move easily. The music is more ambitious and even more haunting here, it fits very well. While lacking the panache of Tom Holland's in the first 'Child's Play', John Lafia's direction is more than competent. Chucky's lines are like in the first two films, darkly witty and clever with one-liners that are smart, frighteningly sarcastic and entertainingly twisted. In terms of individual scenes, the climax comes off best, being a lot of fun'Child's Play 3' does have entertainment value and some creepiness, with the attack scenes/kills and set pieces being creative and genuinely unsettling. Chucky is a character impossible to forget, the writers and effects team had the time of their lives clearly (as well as Brad Dourif of course). Wasn't crazy about the acting here, but will say that Andrew Robinson has an unsettling ball as his character. The biggest acting plus though, like the previous two films, is Dourif, the personification of malevolence and is also wickedly funny.In conclusion, watchable but not great by any stretch. 5/10 Bethany Cox",Child's Play 3
1,Leofwine_draca,Enjoyable B-movie sequel,6,29 December 2015,"This faceless second sequel to the original 1988 hit is a film that's been neglected by fans and critics alike, by and large. It didn't help that an (undeserved) fuss was kicked up over its links with the Jamie Bolger murder case when it was released on VHS here in the UK; a factor that saw it banned for a decade before finally making its way onto late-night telly. CHILD'S PLAY 3 is an undistinguished horror sequel; nothing more or less than a B-movie, but I still liked it better than CHILD'S PLAY 2. It doesn't seem like a rehash this time; it changes setting to a soldier cadet school and the resulting shenanigans are at least entertaining here.A good design was made in setting this one 8 years down the line; annoying child actor Alex Vincent is gone, to be replaced by annoying teenager Justin Whalin. Still, there are some good supporting roles for the likes of HELLRAISER's Andrew Robinson as a crazy military hairdresser and Travis Fine as a jock/bully type. Perrey Reeves makes for a feisty female sidekick while Jeremy Sylvers as the token child actor is far more appealing than his predecessor; it also goes without saying that Brad Dourif, returning as Chucky, puts in another hilarious voice performance.There's more plotting here than before, but it doesn't get in the way of some cheesy murders. Fun's to be had when a paintball game turns deadly, while Chucky's denouement in a ghost train ride is mildly entertaining in its own way, although unbelievable as health and safety would have shut this fairground down long ago, what with its grim reapers wielding real scythes and massive open fan blades spinning on the floor next to the trains. CHILD'S PLAY 3 is far from a good film, but at least it isn't boring – something I can't say for the mind-numbing part two, a film I've forgotten about just one day after I saw it.",Child's Play 3
2,SnoopyStyle,so much wrong,4,19 October 2014,"It's been eight years since the second film. The Good Guys factory had been mothballed. Play Pals Toy Company decides to reintroduce the Good Guys line. As they clean up the old plastic, Chucky's blood gets into the new batch of plastic. The spirit of Charles Lee Ray is once again inside a Good Guys doll. First he kills the CEO. Then he tracks down Andy Barclay (Justin Whalin) who is now 16 and in Kent Military School. His instructor is the hard nosed Shelton. De Silva (Perrey Reeves) is spunky fellow cadet. Young cadet Tyler is suppose to bring Chucky to Andy but he decides to keep Chucky for himself. Chucky introduces himself to Tyler and tries to transfer his soul.It's a mistake to jump ahead in time to a teenager Andy. The iconic character is Chucky but the other character should be a child Andy. Half of the tension in the first two movies comes from the fact that nobody believes the little kid. This movie is stupider and has none of the tension. The whole military school isn't any fun and the idea of family is completely gone. Tyler is written like an idiot. The movie is pretty bad. This is a darker movie but not necessarily any better for it. Chucky is a bit more funnier with the verbal jabs. That is probably the only good to come from this movie.",Child's Play 3
3,jboothmillard,Child's Play 3,2,8 July 2007,"I watched bits of this third film in the franchise for Media Studies, studying ""Shocking Cinema"", this is due to the controversy the film caused, I had also seen the DVD poster many times in places, so I had to see the film itself. Basically the Play Pals Inc. factory has been shut down for the last eight years, due to the bad publicity surrounding the events of the supposed killer doll, but they are reigniting the business. In the process of clearing up the mess left behind, the remains of dead Chucky the doll, possessed by the soul of Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif) (named after Charles Mason, Lee Harvey Oswald and James Earl Ray) are picked up, his preserved blood drips into the vat of liquid plastic that will make the new line of Good Guy Dolls. Chucky is the first doll to come off the assembly line, he is reawakened and immediately murders Pal Pals Inc. CEO, Mr. Sullivan (Peter Haskell). Chucky uses a computer to locate his former owner, now sixteen-year-old Andy Barclay (Justin Whalin), who has been enrolled at a military school. Andy, being the new recruit, is immediately despised by Cadet Lt. Col. Brett C. Shelton (Travis Fine), who loves to bully all the cadets, including Harold Aubrey Whitehurst (Dean Jacobson), and Kristen De Silva (Escape to Witch Mountain's Perrey Reeves). Young cadet Ronald Tyler (Jeremy Sylvers), who has seen the recent commercial for the re-release of Good Guy Dolls, is handed a package to be given to Andy. Dropping the package, Tyler is excited to see from a rip it is a Good Guy Doll, Chucky comes to life when he is opened up. But instead of going to look for Andy, he realises that with a new body he can possess the first person he reveals his identity to, so he tells Tyler his real name. Andy is worried that something bad is going on as a garbage man dies in mysterious circumstances. Soon enough, Chucky reveals himself alive again, the young man realises his new plan is to possess Tyler. Chucky goes from place to place and murders more and more people, including the school's commandant Col. Cochrane (Bean's Dakin Matthews) and military barber Maj. Botnick (Hellraiser's Andrew Robinson), in the process of trying to pass his soul into Tyler. Andy tries to convince Tyler that Chucky is evil, but he does not listen, Whitehurst does see Chucky come to life, but he refuses to help the situation, fearing the consequences. The base all prepare to go on a war games (military simulation) exercise, split into two teams, red and blue, to capture the opposite team's flag, using rifles filled with paint bullets, but Chucky replaces the guns with live rounds. During the night, Tyler and Chucky are reunited, the little boy realises that the doll is indeed bad. The live rounds kill a few people, and Whitehurst kills himself on an exploding grenade to save the others. Tyler escapes and makes his way towards the near carnival fairground, Andy and De Silva catch up with him, as does Chucky. Tyler hides in the carnival haunted house ride, while trying to catch him, Chucky has his face sliced off by a Grim Reaper statue's moving scythe. Chucky is stopped from completing his incantation to transfer his soul, with Andy shooting his arm and cutting his hand off, before he is thrown off the edge, and sliced to pieces by the spinning blades of the large fan below. Chucky's remains are scattered, De Silva is taken away in an ambulance, and Andy taken away in a police car as the carnival closes down. Also starring Burke Byrnes as Sgt. Clark, Matthew Walker as Sgt. Ellis and Donna Eskra as Ivers. Whalin is a pretty dull as the replacement for the original cute victim Alex Vincent, the rest of the cast are no better, the puppet effects are less impressive, and no menacing and wisecracking voice of Dourif can save it. The story being set in a military school is silly, it is so predictable, the deaths are only okay, it is boring, and you can tell the making of the film was rushed, it came only nine months after the second film, it is definitely the worst of the films in the series. What really adds to the dislike for the film is the tabloid frenzy it caused: in 1993, in Britain, two-year-old James Bulger was kidnapped, abused, tortured, and murdered by ten-year-old Jon Venables, and ten-year-old Robert Thompson, there were reports that claimed that they may have watched Child's Play 3, and been influenced by scenes to commit the horrific crime. These claims were dismissed by the police as being false, neither of the boys would have watched the video, it just happened to be at the house of Venables's father who had rented it, nevertheless, these claims have stuck with the film, but aside from this stuff, it is a really terrible horror. Pretty poor!",Child's Play 3
4,BA_Harrison,Burn this video nasty? It's not THAT bad!,5,7 March 2012,"In 1993, British tabloid The Sun urged its readers to burn copies of Child's Play 3, not because it was an unworthy chapter in a series that was already struggling for ideas, but because it held the film responsible in part for the horrific murder of a three year old boy by two older children; the fact that neither of the killers had watched the movie didn't seem to matter to the newspaper, who had their scapegoat and duly vilified it.The truth is, of course, that Child's Play 3 could only ever be deemed a 'video nasty' by muck-raking Fleet Street hacks out to shift copies of their rag or by the most vehement of pro-censorship campaigners. If they'd taken the time to actually watch the thing—which is unlikely—they would have realised just how ridiculous their campaign against the film really was: this predictable third outing for Chucky, the toy doll possessed by the spirit of a mass murderer, is harmless, formulaic popcorn nonsense, far less deviant than the press would have had us believe, and—being fantasy-based rather than grounded in reality—even less likely to corrupt.",Child's Play 3
5,Quinoa1984,It in no way tops the first 2 and other one but still...,5,7 December 2000,"Child's Play 3 isn't a horrible example of a horror sequel (like Nightmare on Elm Street 2, Halloween 6 or Friday the 13th part 5) but it definately can not top the other Chucky films.  Here, Chucky returns to find Andy again, this time though, it is somehow 8 years later (though only 1 year after the last film) and Andy is a teen in a military camp, but now Chucky has a new target.  Some very effective chills (I think the line ""presto, your dead"" is classic in the barber scene) and another barf-bag climax (I don't think any other film has such decapitation of a kid's doll) bring this film to be not too bad, but of course, the sequel overkill almost makes this film not too good.  But it does have a good beginnign with visual quality. C+",Child's Play 3
6,michaelRokeefe,Chucky is back. Stalking is only part of his game.,4,4 May 2002,"Andy Barclay(Justin Whalin)the young boy that claimed he saw a doll commit a series of murders is now older and finds himself sent to a military school. Chucky stalks Andy to the school and finds another likely candidate to support his evil ways. Really not a bad flick after it gets going. I thought the chase sequence at the amusement park was very well done. The finale is awesomely fatal; now conjure up a way for this series to continue. Supporting cast features Jeremy Sylvers, Perrey Reeves and Travis Fine. Andrew Robinson is the diabolical barber and once again Brad Dourif is the voice of 'Chucky'.",Child's Play 3
7,Scarecrow-88,Child's Play 3,4,6 June 2009,"""Don't f#ck with the Chuck.""Sorry Jack, Chucky's back..again. The third film in the series regarding the psycho doll possessed with the spirit of serial killer Charles Lee Ray needing a human host to exit from his plastic shell. After being resurrected from the doll factory via blood dripping from the damaged plastic(..Chucky's destruction in the previous film), Chucky kills the business executive who decided to start up the manufacturing of ""Good Guy"" toys, discovering that old nemesis Andy(Justin Whalin) is much older, shipped to a military school after spending time in multiple foster homes. Chucky finds another candidate in a young black boy, Tyler(Jeremy Sylvers) who Andy must protect, but this will be difficult because of Cadet Lt Col Brett C Shelton(Travis Fine), his commanding officer who makes life especially hard for new recruits. Shelton is simply a bullying thug allowed to treat certain cadets he doesn't like harshly, hiding behind his rank. Meanwhile, Chucky tricks Tyler into believing they're friends with Andy having to figure out ways to rescue him. Chucky, also, kills a few characters around the Kent military school for fun.There are essentially three acts to the film. The first act primarily consists of Andy's troubles adjusting to his new environment as Chucky roams around using his doll disguise as a means to startle victims before killing them. One victim, a garbage man hears Chucky's cries for help, hops into the truck's hopper to find him and is crushed inside(Chucky is able to escape quietly without the garbage man knowing) by the doll with no way to escape. Col Cochran(..the man in charge of the military school, who informs Andy that his place turns bed-wetters into men) actually has a heart attack when Chucky draws a hunting knife, not exactly a flattering way for such a decorated soldier's life to end. A third plans to give Chucky a hair cut(!)falling victim to a straight razor. The second act occurs in the woods near the school where a blue and red team, conducted of the cadets and their leaders, take part in a paint ball exercise with Chucky targeting Tyler(..red team)with Andy(..blue team, under Shelton's command, of course)having to abandon his team in order to save the kid. Chucky actually loaded the red team's rifles with actual rounds, resulting in an accidental murder, also threatening the life of Kristen(Perrey Reeves), Andy's love interest(..also part of blue team)with a grenade if Tyler(..who finally understands why Andy was warning him about Chucky)isn't handed over. A cadet gives his life when Chucky hurls his live grenade at the students. The third act involves the main principles, Andy and Kristen chasing after Chucky(..who has taken Tyler prisoner with a small gun found in the drawer of a security guard's desk)into a carnival outside the woods, with the climax taking place in a spooky funhouse ride.This film certainly was the low point in a series that seemed to digress in quality from one sequel to the next. Chucky tosses out lots of quips after murdering folks, which I admit to grinning at amusingly, but I found the overall film rather tiresome and the kills are relatively tame. The next two films, a far cry from the series which focused on Chucky terrorizing Andy, take a giant leap in terms of originality and casting. The casting in this film is rather colorless for the exception of Andrew Robinson as a military barber with a few screws loose(..who definitely has pride in his work)and Brad Dourif providing the enthusiastic voice of Chucky who thoroughly enjoys murdering people. I must admit that the use of a yo-yo to strangle a victim is rather unique. Dean Jacobson is cadet Whitehurst, an object of ridicule for Shelton who constantly berates him(..among others). Peter Haskell is Sullivan, the businessman who restarts the factory that led to Chucky's rebirth. Chucky's ""colorful"" language might earn giggles.",Child's Play 3
8,poolandrews,"""Don't f*ck with the Chuck."" I quite liked it actually.",7,26 February 2007,"Child's Play 3 starts as the Good Guy doll factory resumes production after several years of closure after the controversy surrounding young Andy Barclay & his tales of killer doll's. The company boss Mr. Sullivan (Peter Haskell) is presented with the first Good Guy doll straight off the production line, unfortunately what he doesn't know is that the doll is possessed by the spirit of serial killer Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif) who calls himself Chucky. Chucky the doll comes to life, kills Sullivan & sets about finding the whereabouts of Andy (Justin Whalin) who has been sent to Kent military school to learn some discipline after rejecting several foster parents, Andy is Chucky's way out of the doll & posts himself to Andy but the parcel is opened by a young cadet named Tyler (Jeremy Sylvers) whom Chucky takes a liking to & decides to use his body instead of Andy's...Directed by Jack Bender I thought Child's Play 3 was a decent film & actually preferred it to the original Child's Play (1988). The script by Mr. Child's Play himself Don Mancini moves along at a fair pace & I never found myself losing interest, it doesn't seem to take itself too seriously, the overall story is good & I liked the military academy setting. But that doesn't really matter because a Child's Play film is all about Chucky & his foul mouthed homicidal ways, the obscenity littered one-liners are present & correct & you see in Child' Play 3 that he is becoming the star of the series. The 'you gotta be f*ckin' kidding me' line as someone has a heart attack is hilarious the way he says it although whether you'll like this type of bad taste humour all depends on what you want from the series I suppose, you either want a straight horror film or a horror comedy & to be honest I think there's a good balance between the horror & the dark comedy. The character's are alright & the dialogue is fine but I thought there was a real lack of kills, I really wish Chucky had gotten to do more as he steals every scene he's in as it is & is the main reason why Child's Play 3 & the series as a whole is as watchable as it is.Director Bender doesn't do anything special, the film while well made is a bit flat & forgettable. The film tries to throw a few scars in here & there but mainly it's in-your-face type stuff as Chucky swears his way through the film, the special effects are pretty good even though there are one or two stiff looking puppet effects. The gore & violence levels are disappointing, there's a cool slit throat but very little else including a virtually bloodless scene when someone is blown up by a grenade, I mean if you were blown up with a grenade wouldn't there be lots of blood everywhere?Technically Child's Play 3 is good, it isn't going to win any awards but since it was produced by Universal studios it has a certain Hollywood polish to it. Released only 9 months after Child' Play 2 (1990) writer of all the Child's Play films Mancini has apparently said Child's Play 3 is his least favourite of the five. I have to mention the opening scene & credits which show Chucky being made because I think they're very cool & very effective. The acting is OK with Brad Dourif voicing Chucky obviously standing out.Child's Play 3 is a good little horror film that I liked more than I thought I would & I prefer it to the original by a fair margin despite it's lack of gore & kills. Followed by the fabulous Bride of Chucky (1998) & Seed of Chucky (2004).",Child's Play 3
9,lastliberal,Don't f*ck with the Chuck.,4,16 October 2007,"Boy, if you talk to anyone about this flick, you get polar opposites on whether it is the best or the worst in the series.Personally, I tend to fall with those who did not like it as well as the first two. There was something about Andy as a child that made the films interesting that was lost in the military academy crap. There was just too much BS with Cadet Lt. Col. Brett C. Shelton, Sgt. Botnick, and Maj. Ellis that detracted from the main story.Justin Whalin did a good job in the film, and Perrey Reeves was sweet, but the rest of the cast just didn't do anything for me.I did like the battle in the fun house, though.",Child's Play 3
10,Boba_Fett1138,Seems they ran out of ideas already.,5,2 November 2011,"For me it's also a sign that a movie series is declining when it's placing itself at a new and totally different venue, such as in space, on a school, or as in this case on a military academy.OK, so this is not the worst genre ever made but it is the one in which the Child's Play-series started to turn silly. Chucky suddenly is more busy delivering puns than killing people and the movie is definitely paying less attention to its horror elements, especially when compared to the first two movies. You therefore also really shouldn't watch this movie expecting a lot of tension, scares, gore or other typical horror elements.But that's not necessarily a complaint of course. I mean, if the movie is fun to watch then it shouldn't really have mattered that the movie isn't much great as an horror. But the movie just isn't all that fun or great to watch, since it's such a simple written one, in which the story doesn't even make sense in the first place.I don't get it. It's already established early on in the movie that Chucky doesn't need Andy anymore to regain an human form but yet he keeps going after him. Why go through all the trouble Chuck? I though it was also weird that he picked a new kid for his soul to transfer to, while in the first movie he was complaining about it that he had to transfer his soul into little Andy if he ever wanted to be human again. He now had the chance to literally pick anybody he wanted but instead he went for a stupid (literally, this kid is just stupid), whiny little kid again. What's the deal with that?There really is no reason for Andy to be in this movie again. Guess they thought it would help the series forward by featuring an 16-year old Andy this time but they should have known that the series was never about its human characters but the good guy doll Chucky instead. It also never feels like this is the same Andy as from the first two movies. In this movie, 8 years had passed since the last encounter with Chucky, so Andy had grown and looked and acted nothing like the little kid that he once was. It of course also doesn't help that he is being played by a completely different actor this time. No, it was a bad and totally unnecessary move to have Andy in this movie again. I imaging it was probably due to it that the movie went through numerous re-writes, which really messed things up.It feels like such an uninspired movie, as if they weren't even trying to come up with something good or original, as long as it would be making some money. It's not an horrible movie but I can totally understand why this is a much hated movie, by especially the fans of the Child's Play-series.It's a sequel you can easily skip on.5/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Child's Play 3
11,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Definitely worse than the first two, but not all bad",4,22 March 2005,"Lets get one thing straight; this film is bad. The plot is poorly written and full of gaping holes. The pacing is awful; the film drags by so slowly that it'll take all of your tolerance and patience to sit through the entire film. The acting is hammy, with no exception(well, possibly Brad Dourif as the voice of Chucky... but that almost doesn't count, since he's always good anyway). The characters are daftly written clichés and stereotypes. The dialog is unforgivably bad. The death scenes are slower, less detailed and generally less interesting and cool than the first two. Yes, this film is bad, very bad. But surprisingly, it's not completely intolerable. I found myself actually enjoying several parts of it. I think the main thing making this bad is that it's basically the story of the first; a kid gets a talking doll, it tells him that it's in reality a psychopathic killer, and he stays close to it, despite people around him dying. There are a few alterations to the formula, but they really don't change the fact that this is almost a remake of the first. The changes are that this time, the kid isn't Andy, the kid is slower at figuring out that Chucky is bad and it takes place at a military school. What really bothered me is that there's almost no tie-in with the first two films whatsoever. In the first scene, we get a quick summary of what happened in the first film, told by someone who has no idea what really happened, and then at one point, we see a picture of Andy as a child and his mother. No mention of Kyle, no real justification for him being at the military school. Also, why does Play Pal keep reconstructing Chucky? More importantly, how the heck does Chucky manage to mail himself complete in a Good Guy box to the military school? The film has so many shortcomings, yet I couldn't help but enjoy it to an extent. Some parts of it were actually slightly good. I liked the twist of Chucky chasing someone other than Andy for once. I will say that the Full Metal Jacket spoof was painful, though. If Kubrick wasn't alive when this was made, he would have turned in his grave. The end of this one isn't as overdone as the first two, which I found good(but some may be disappointed). All in all, this is probably the worst Chucky film, but it's not as bad as some say. Note that my rating is below average, but only slightly. I recommend this to fans of the Child's Play series and horror fans... be warned that this is the lesser film of the series, though. 4/10",Child's Play 3
12,view_and_review,Chucky can't let Andy go,2,30 March 2020,"Chucky and Freddy are the two funniest of the franchise slashers, with Chucky being the funniest of them all. It's something about a foul-mouthed man voice coming out of a kids' toy that makes me laugh.Once again, they have devised a way to bring Chucky (Brad Dourif) back to life via the Good Guy doll. And once again Chucky is after Andy Barclay. Now it has been about seven years after ""Child's Play 2""--though only a year has really passed--and Andy (Justin Whalin) is in a military school.This movie had problems written all over it. A military school had to be one of the worst venues imaginable. The only thing worse would've been a nursery. Not only did we have to suffer through stupid military clichés with barking commanding officers and insubordinate junior officers, it's a place full of minors, and we know that minors typically do not get killed in scary movies.Once CP3 (""Child's Play 3"" not Chris Paul) identified all of the saints and sinners we knew who was going to live and who was going to die, which makes a movie very tedious to watch. It was just plain lazy. Chucky, once again, was after Andy in order to take over his body. We knew it was going to be an even taller task--no pun intended--with Andy being a teenager and not the naïve and physically unimposing little boy. No matter, Chucky found another little extremely gullible and probably partially mentally deficient little boy named Tyler (Jeremy Sylvers).Chucky spent the entire movie pursuing Tyler and evading Andy while killing all of the people we knew were earmarked to be killed based upon their horrible behavior at the beginning of the movie. Part three was the worst part up until that point, which is to be expected. If Chucky could have dispensed with trying to pursue Andy yet again maybe, just maybe, the movie would've been better. But as it is, he is continuing upon the same route with the exact same motive. I don't disagree with his motive---who wants to be stuck as a doll forever--- but we know that in part two he was unsuccessful in transferring his soul into Andy's body because he had been a doll too long. So, what does he think now after 10 years of being a doll, and the third different doll on top of that? Does he really believe he's going to be able to transfer his soul now?The Chuckster was cool, he just needs to rethink things. His total kills were a paltry seven, which is what Jason Voorhese does in the first twenty minutes. And Chucky himself was killed easier than the two movies prior. He did get stabbed (flesh wound). He got half his face sliced off (made him uglier but no biggie). Andy shot off his left arm (painful but not fatal). Andy cut off Chucky's left hand (now he'll need prosthetics for sure). Finally, Chucky was thrown into an industrial sized fan that made him into Chucklets.",Child's Play 3
13,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Far better than it's reputation,9,22 October 2015,"Off at a military academy, Andy's attempts to move on are interrupted when Chucky returns trying to finish what he started only for a shift in Chucky's attention to put the rest of the academy in danger and forcing him to stop Chucky again.On the whole this one was highly entertaining and one of the better efforts in the series. Much like the rest of the series, the film gets quite a lot of mileage from the fact that Chucky's true identity is hidden away far into the film as once again there's plenty of walking in at just the wrong moment to catch him alive. The fight in the barracks where he first reveals himself to Andy and the later scene where he sneaks in trying to steal him back that ends up alerting only him in the room are quite nicely handled, as well as the incidents around the academy that are more than just accidental deaths with the way they continually occur around here. The death of their leader in the office and the barber which gets witnessed that not only works well here but also come off as rather fun scenes overall that builds up quite well. All of this builds up really nicely to the big final half here which has a lot of frantic action and big suspense throughout. This starts off with the paint-ball game itself which is quite possibly among the best scenes in the series with the formations and scouting, the searching in the woods once they get wind of the situation mistakenly taking him to be a spy which sets up the overall fun and enjoyment of the double-cross and resulting shootout which is quite fun at the demented and cruel air this gives the film, and leads into the fun of the carnival finale as the stalking through the hordes of people there and how it manages to find itself into the attraction is outstanding. That in itself is more great fun with the different stalking and interactions throughout the settings inside before the over-the-top fun of getting to the big resolution that transpires here. Along with some really fine kills and the start of the series' turn for the comedic in terms of his sayings and expressions, these here are enough to hold this up against the minor flaws here. Much like the previous entry, this one again tends to be set-up in tone and execution like the original which isn't based on anything new or creative with its storyline here and it's rather uncreative. Likewise, this also causes the other problem here as this one tends to be a little too far-fetched in how the kids here take to believe the story, as not only is there way too much evidence that something's going on but that they don't start matching the clues together as they really do make sense that something's happening. That doesn't impact this one as much as the others did with that, but it sticks out enough to slightly lower this.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and children-in-jeopardy.",Child's Play 3
14,StevePulaski,Masterpiece to Crap Just Like That,2,15 July 2010,"Its almost unbelievable that a franchise can go from two close to masterpiece Horror films to one film that just spits on the entire franchise. Childs Play 3 is the obvious third installment to the doll killer franchise and its undoubtedly the worst to come. Its a poorly acted, odd Horror film that you consider yourself lucky to see because of the awful darkness of the movie itself. Screenwriter Don Mancini confessed to completely and totally running out of ideas for the series which is no doubt why after this one there was a seven year gap until Bride of Chucky, and then a six year gap until Seed of Chucky was made. Seems like ideas for killer dolls that need to find a human soul were hard to come by.This is a weird one to explain, The Good Guy Doll Factory has reopened and reassembled Chucky which still has the soul of Charles Lee Ray in the doll. Andy is now 16 and has been shipped off to Military School and apparently has been in more foster homes then just the Simpsons', and has failed in all of them. Ronald Tyler, a younger recruit takes the Chucky doll to Andy, but in a failed attempt to get possessed, goes on a killing spree again to find Andy and try to transfer his soul. Its the same movie in a different environment, but just unrealistically stupid.What bothers me is two things. One, its so dark in this carnival, military camp, trying to see whats going on is harder than understanding it. Most of the time, Im clueless and just assuming what is happening. Another thing, is we get no mention to what happens to Kyle (Andy's foster sister in CP2). We get zero information. At least in the second one they say that the mother is in psychiatric therapy. So overall, this is shockingly the worst Horror film I've ever seen. There's no adrenaline pumping scenes, and everything is just dark (quite literally). This still amazes me that a franchise can go from excellent to awful in just three movies. If a franchise makes it the third film they should put a lot of effort into it, not just throw some back ass movie together with almost no sense made. Maybe around 1991 they were learning movie sequels attract a lot of money no matter the plot. At very least we get Brad Dourif's excellent voice talents.Starring: Justin Whalin, Perrey Reeves, Jeremy Sylvers, Peter Haskell, Dakin Matthews, Travis Fine, Dean Jacobson, and Brad Dourif.

15,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Yeah, it was bad, but I liked it better than the first two",4,19 July 2006,"I think deep down inside somewhere in these movies, I think the Child's Play movies are more of a comedy. When I laugh at a horror movie than scream, that can't be good. But I'm not sure why, it's still the same elements as the first two Child's Play films, but I think this one was more scary for the fact that Chucky was finally smart enough to just grab a gun, because it's more unbelievable when a two pound doll attacks a grown person and manages to win the battle. Also it had more gore in it and scary elements, so when it comes to this point, I'd have to say I've enjoyed this Child's Play movie the most so far. I heard Bride of Chucky is really good, so I'm looking forward to it, I just hope I'm not disappointed, I really miss my horror films.4/10",Child's Play 3
16,KineticSeoul,The 3rd time isn't the charm for this franchise,3,6 June 2014,"This one is the most boring entry in this franchise so far despite the premise and setting, which takes place in a military school. It's like they wanted a military setting with a villain (like in other horror movies in that kind of setting) and thought up the closes way to execute that. But it falters because of a crappy script and poorly written characters that are more annoying than entertaining or stands out. There are more characters this time around, but they are so darn insignificant to the plot. Even the romance between Andy and DeSilva is more distracting over having a well crafted chemistry between the two. The chemistry between Andy and Kyle was done much better. This just wasn't a impactful way to end the Child's Play trilogy before it goes in the comedic parody direction. Although Chucky is evil and more sadistic than he has ever been, most of the characters and most of the screen-time is taken up with them just walking around and looking at Chucky in a dumbfounded manner. There is now no logic and constant loopholes when it comes to the revival of Chucky. In the first movie to kill Chucky it's to destroy his heart. The second installment revived Chucky by putting his skull on another body. This time you can just revive Chucky with his blood alone, which doesn't make sense since they tried to revive him by taking him apart and adding new parts in the second installment. Which would lead him to bleed as well, but does not. Maybe because it was before he fully became human inside a dolls body. The main complaint about the second installment is the lack of blood, gore and violence when it came to the kills. Even for a horror comedy this is just bland and not really funny, nor does it have suspense. Chucky is not after Tyler's body over Andy's body, which contradicts the rules of the first ""Child's Play"" movie. Tyler is another character that they probably put in to be this cute little innocent child, but just came off annoying after a while. Andy has grown up and isn't the cute kid anymore, but is more of a wuss this time around. The military school environment could have been a interesting direction, I was in a military school before so it brought back some nostalgic memories. But WAY more crazy stuff went down when I was in the military school. They really did run out of ideas when it came to this 3rd installment. Some may like the second one better, I personally think this 3rd one is the worst compared to the previous 2.3.9/10",Child's Play 3
17,OllieSuave-007,A quite good horror sequel for a few scares.,8,3 October 2017,"The not-so-innocent movie about a child's doll continues with Andy Barkley (Justin Whalin), now a teenager, enrolling into military school. The authorities and corporate officials discount Andy's story about Chucky the killer doll as fantasy and re-markets the doll in stores. Soon, Chucky comes back to life and sneaks into the school to take revenge on Andy and seek a new body.The plot's pacing, script, and music score work fine in this movie, with some suspense, thrills and creepy moments. The acting was pretty good for the most part - especially enjoyed the characters of Andy and De Silva, the tough but sympathetic female cadet. Some of the military characters were a little overbearing and the lead kid character was a little mediocre I thought.Whalin portrayed Andy with determination and endurance in braving through the grueling military obstacles and in going against Chucky. Brad Dourif gave another sinister, dark, and sarcastically funny portrayal of Chucky.The overall plot may seam quite entertaining, but almost predictable now by the third entry. Still, a quite good horror sequel for a few scares.Grade B",Child's Play 3
18,thesar-2,Beating a Dead Doll,3,18 October 2009,"Surprisingly, an improvement over #2, and still, 'Child's Play 3' is too much of a waste of time. Sure, it's harmless, but it's just another excuse to beat a dead doll. Chucky's back, and again it's a preposterous reincarnation and introduction. We find him stalking little Andy (now a teen in a military reform school) again, despite part two's explanation that Chucky can't transfer his lost soul into the boy anymore. Some of the humor's there, my favorite was the Colonel's death mixed with Chucky's surprise and disappointment. Thankfully, now that Andy's grown a bit, he's played by a much better actor that has some (I said some) range. I also liked him in the 'Lois & Clark' Jimmy role (he was in 2-4, replacing the dud they hired for Jimmy in season 1.) And I admit some of the lines Chucky used was mildly funny as well as the conclusion in the seemingly never ending haunted house was appropriate for the series. Unfortunately, the whole movie was just another remake of #1-2 and the inconsistencies and plot holes were fairly large. Would they really put sharp knifes in the haunted house? Would someone seriously not report a death that just happened and go off to play a game? Yeah, I'm looking too deep. It's safe to skip #2 and #3 and return when Chucky returns in full force in 'Bride of Chucky.'",Child's Play 3
19,lost-in-limbo,Chucky visits military school.,5,13 October 2008,"Hey that's quite an effective opening with the credits. Anyhow the third instalment of the murderous good guy doll possessed by the serial killer Charles Lee Ray sees an older teenage Andy Barclay settling in to military school. But with the resurrection of the once popular Good Guys dolls, Chucky is brought back to life and once again tracks down Andy. But after finding him, Chucky sets his eyes upon the young Ronald Tyler who discovers his secret. So now Chucky is trying rid Andy, so that he won't get in the way him transferring his soul in to Tyler.So really the premise is the same with only a slight slant to the formula. Even with its well-worn mechanics and lacking chills it's enjoyably fun, if quite a mean-spirited and forceful sequel. I was liking it until just after halfway when it loses its way and transcends into cheap silliness. Watch as each film goes on to wallow in the wicked black humour, by never taking itself entirely serious. The script (which almost goes on to play everything as a joke because it seems they can only go to that angle) manages to throw a smart little quip for Chucky to spit out whenever on screen. Strangely the puppet design doesn't fair up that well compared to the previous films, but I rather take this vividly etched creation than anything resembling computer generated effects.The performances are engaging enough. Justin Whalin is modest in the part as the older Andy and Perry Reeves kicks up some fire as Andy's love interest. Brad Dourif dependably returns to be everyone's favourite Good Guy Doll Chucky once again. That wicked tone and driving cackle have just become a constant trademark. In support there's a lively Andrew Robinson and a hard-nosed Travis Fine. Jeremy Sylvers suitably plays it naïve as Tyler.Director Jack Bender (more renown for his TV work) professionally caters for the production in quite a mechanical fashion. Few amusing death scenes crop up and a playful energy is created. The score is mostly well-placed with its burning rock cues which vibrate an ominous charge.Not the complete dead horse many make it out to be.",Child's Play 3
20,bowmanblue,An okay addition to the franchise,7,1 August 2014,"'Child's Play 3' is one of those films you either love or hate (assuming you liked the first two, anyway). It continues the tale of the killer doll ('Chucky') who's possessed by the soul of a serial killer blah, blah, blah and is still hunting down the only person who he can transfer his soul into. However, his 'soul's desire' is no longer a young boy, but a teenager at military school. This basically gives the film its setting for the next ninety minutes.No, Part 3 is not really as good as parts 1 and 2. Even the writer admits to feeling 'rushed' into doing as sequel so quick off the back of part 2. However, it's not as bad as it could be. There's nothing amazingly original here – Chucky kills, no one believes that the doll's real until it's too late and so on. Like Part 2, everyone who's in any way nasty (mainly adults) meet a sticky end, leaving you to almost feel that Chucky is doing the world a favour by getting rid of them.But there are some nice set pieces among the obligatory 'teen romance' sub plot, so, like I said, if you liked the first two, you'll probably enjoy this one – just don't raise your hopes too high.Also, it's worth noting that Part 3 is the last Child's Play/Chucky film to 'play it straight.' After this one, the franchise took a 'less serious' tone. If you continue to watch the films that follow, expect more black comedy instead of chills.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Child's Play 3
21,bowmanblue,Weakest of the initial trilogy?,7,4 September 2018,"Child's Play 3' is the sort of 'final part' to the 'Chucky' franchise. Not that it was ever really marketed as so (such as something like 'Friday 13th: The Final Chapter'), but it just felt like the end. The original two films were about a doll, possessed with the soul of a killer, trying to escape his 'plastic prison' by re-transferring his soul into the first human he had revealed his 'true self' to, i.e. a little boy called Andy. I guess there was a limit as to how many times the evil doll could try, fail, be destroyed in a grisly fashion and then find himself accidentally resurrected again to rinse and repeat. Therefore, a new actor plays a (slightly) grown up Andy here where he's at military school now. But - guess what - Chucky still wants to transfer his soul into the teen.It's interesting to note that 'Part 3' comes out a mere nine months after its predecessor and it feels it. Overall, it just feels rushed with nothing that original here. Even the film's creator and also the voice of Chucky, Brad Dourif, came out after the film's release and mentioned that it was their least favourite of the franchise. It's also the last one before the *ahem* 'reboot.' And, when I say 'reboot' I mean that after this the producers basically dropped the 'Child's Play' title and focused on (arguably) the film's true star, the Chucky doll himself. The films that followed were all more 'horror-comedies,' rather than really trying to be out and out scare-fests.The story is pretty identical, i.e. killer doll stalks kids and no one believes them when they try and tell the adults around them. It's not scary and not that gory. Brad Dourif is typically on form as Chucky, but this is still the most average (certainly of the three originals). The other characters are equally forgettable. All adults are only there to berate the kids for their silly fantasies about living dolls before being killed and the supporting youngsters all conform to their respective cliches. I guess maybe we - the audience - felt a far greater attachment to a young boy being stalked by a psychotic killer doll, rather than a teen who has access to firearms and an entire army around him. If you're looking for laughs then keep going with the franchise, as the 'Seed' and 'Bride' of Chucky are very funny, whereas if you prefer the darker tone then the first two films should be for you (until the later 'proper' reboot which tries to tale the story back to its horror roots). If you're a fan of the series you might want to have this one in your collection, but if you're generally just dipping your toe into the franchise, you can sort of gloss over it. Parts 1 and 2 are far superior.",Child's Play 3
22,ericstevenson,Some good scenes can't make up for it,3,15 April 2018,"I love Leonard Maltin's review of this movie where he ends it by saying, ""...contrived even by the standards of this junk"" and he's quite right! This movie features Andy as a teenager in military school. Chucky once again returns. This time he's resurrected by his blood dripping into a vat of plastic. He finds another kid to transfer his soul into. Didn't he already reveal himself to his first victim in the movie?He's so dumb he actually tells Andy his plan and there isn't even any reason to meet up with Andy in the first place. Bond villains aren't this dumb! I remember that this was the exact movie that really terrified me as a kid. It's great that I was able to overcome my childhood fears by realizing how stupid it was! I do like the scene at the end where Andy shoots Chucky. While not the worst slasher movie, at least one of the worst. *1/2",Child's Play 3
23,CuriosityKilledShawn,Stretching the formula too far.,6,2 April 1999,"Set eights years after Child's Play 2, this sequel sees Andy Barclay attending Military School and getting bullied by the drill sergeant (""poor man's Christian Slater"" Travis Fine, who never really became as popular as he should have been). Meanwhile, the Play Pals company has reopened the Good Guy factory and is starting production of the doll once more. But when clearing away Chucky's grisly remains, some of his blood spills into a vat of molten plastic and he is born once more in a new body.After a good old strangulation to get the circulation going he locates Andy at his military school and somehow figures out a way to mail himself there. However, once the package gets there it is promptly snatched by a very annoying, morbidly juvenile, and highly wimpy little kid called Tyler who has the same face as has-been 'singer' Craig David, only more annoying (if that is even possible). Since he has a new body Chucky reveals his birth name once more, hoping to get a fast and easy ticket out of his plastic shell. As before there are too many distractions.And as before the film spends way too much time with boring humans who spend too much time lurking in the dark wondering why a doll seems to appear and reappear and not enough time with Chucky. He IS the star of the show and he should OWN this movie. Alias and Lost director Jack Bender never really gives him the chance. Which is a shame since the animatronics had improved over Child's Play 2 and Chucky was beginning to look nastily cute. And more and more like Brad Dourif if you look hard enough. Bender's direction is slick but lacks edge, invention or humor. He seems to be ignorant of the potential Chucky has and treats the film like another mechanical TV series with no spark or signature. I remember when I first watched the VHS tape as a kid I immediately noticed how darker and gloomier this movie is, which ultimately leads to an overwhelming downbeat, depressing atmosphere, that sort of does and sort of doesn't work.The score is a major downer though. Greame Revell's wonderful orchestral adventure of Child's Play 2 has been replaced with a horrid synthesized, death-metal score filled with tacky and unimaginative stingers. Revell, fortunately, returned for Bride of Chucky.Child's Play 3 is no more than a competent sequel. Writer Don Mancini said he wasn't even ready to do a 3rd movie but Universal forced him to before the second was even released. As he was out of ideas he claims this film to be his least favorite of them all. If a better director were involved it could still have been a good film instead of being a merely an above average (by a tiny, tiny bit) one.",Child's Play 3
24,ironhorse_iv,"Is 'Child's Play 3' worth playing? To put it kindly, not really. Chucky in this movie is not the sharpest knife in the drawer. He could had been better used.",5,28 April 2018,"Under pressure from Universal Pictures, both screenwriter Don Mancini & director Jack Bender didn't have the time to invest much on the development of the story for the third film in the series. Hence, why this picture also known as 'Child's Play 3: Look Who's Stalking', was released only nine months after 1990's 'Child's Play 2' & underperform at the box office. Nevertheless, the story, they did choose for this horror film, was not that bad. The idea that Andy Barclay, now played by Justin Whalin being sent to military school and Chucky, the killer doll (Voiced by Brad Dourif) going on a rampage there, was a good idea. It just fell flat. The story had potential. It really could had taken, a satire good look, into the claim that violent and aggressive toys are grooming children into becoming sadistic soldiers, much like 1992's 'Toys' & 1998's 'Small Soldiers' were trying to do. However, the story & location wasn't well utilize. The military school didn't seem, believable, with the armory being unguarded and buzz cuts being quite long. So, the story settling came across, as quite fake. Not only that, but the film is so badly pace, that, some audiences felt like they were trick, into, watching a different film. ""Child Play 3' spend too much, time on Andy doing random things at military school like dealing with bullies like Lieutenant Colonel Brett C. Shelton (Travis Fine) & falling in love with a female student Kristen De Silva (Perrey Reeves) away from Chucky that it felt like a annoying coming to age teen drama show, than a cheesy horror movie. It get worst, as most of Chucky interactions isn't with the school, at all; as most of the slayings, happens, either at a toy owner's penthouse, a garbage truck, or at a carnival with different characters. Honestly, for most of the film, he doesn't even target Andy at all. Instead, he go after, a new character named Tyler (Jeremy Sylvers), based off an assumption that he can transform, his soul into his body; despite the fact that the boy wasn't the first person that he reveal his possession to. If anything, in this movie, Charles should had been, targeting Mr. Sullivan (Peter Haskell), since, first off, he is adult with power to resurrect his body, multiples times, despite the dangers. Second off, he was the first one to see Charles in his new doll form in this film. Honestly, if Charles was thinking; he would had skip the voodoo body transfer act, since it's nearly meaningless, and just force Sullivan, upgrade his doll body to adult size. At least, he would, have, had, a figure to work it. After all, a small kid's body isn't much of an upgrade from a doll-size body. Instead, Chucky burns those bridges, like a dumbass. It really does seem like he get dumber with each sequel. Also, what is with Chucky, always wasting time? Does he, not know the concept of time management? The movie seems to be really running out of good ideas, on why Chucky is always playing the doll ruse, rather than committing to do the voodoo body transfer act. The whole trying to do the ritual really getting overplayed. Regardless of that, one thing that didn't get old, was the doll's persona with Brad always doing a good job, voice acting. However, lot of dumb silly puns, and gimmicky death jokes in 'Child Play 3' were not that funny. As for the action scenes with Chucky. I kinda like the war game moments and the climatic haunted house scene with the dangerous props like the open fan and really sharp scythe. As for the rest of the movie's kills; they were highly disappointing. The gore effects were very limited, due to the high budget of making the puppet of Chucky look believable. Because of that, much of the murders, in the film, were done off-screen or in a bloodless matter. In other cases, the effects were, clearly forgotten in continuous shots, such as the cut Achilles tendon and Chucky's stab wounds. As for the effects to make Chucky look real. While, highly outdated by today's standard, they were pretty good for the time. As for the supporting cast. I really didn't like, any of them. They were either, playing their roles, too, over the top or really, really bland. Still, I like Justin Whalin's acting, enough, to have him over original Andy actor, Alex Vincent, any day. Vincent was just boring. Nevertheless, the bitter ending with Andy is such a downer. I kinda wish actress, Catherine Hicks as the mom, stay with the series. Better yet, Christine Elise as Kyle, Andy's foster sister from the second movie. Their presence really could had made this film, so much better. As for the film being notorious in the United Kingdom, due to the idea that it inspired the tragic, real-life murder of James Bulger & Suzanne Capper. I found it to be, a lot of crap, when researching the cases. Those murderers never even heard of this movie. Blaming movies for incite violence seem a bit one sided argument, anyways. After all, in real-life, anything in the world can cause a trouble person to act out, violently. In the end, that's why we have a rating system. This movie wasn't made for everybody. Overall: 'Child Play's 3' was a huge disappointment. While, the original movie is also a bit over the top, corny, and silly. It's one of my favorite horror movies of all time. It had some great suspense. I wouldn't say the same for the 'Child Play' sequels. It's just not that fun to play around after knowing that Chucky is alive. No wonder, why these movies are buried in the bottom of the toy box. They're only good for a one time watch.",Child's Play 3

How is he resurrected? Well, apparently when eight years have passed the toy company reopens their Good Guy doll factory, removes the cobwebs off of all the old stock, pick the mutilated, dead Chucky doll up and pop him in a vat of boiling plastics. The springs of Lourdes never had so much healing power! This revives Chucky, and he instantly becomes his mean, killing machine of old and wants to find Andy Barclay to take his soul. Andy, played by Justin Whalin, is an older teenager now and enrolled at a military academy. Well, not to get too bogged down in a script that doesn't really merit such an intense analysis - Chucky finds Andy and continues to basically do what he did in the two earlier films. Lots of killing. Lots of wisecracks and that cackling laugh. Lots of the same. I did like this film more though than the second installment. First of all, the director did NOT repeat the problem of an overly long, seemingly never-ending death scene. The military school makes for an interesting backdrop to the story. The young actors do credible jobs. There are some interesting , quirky characterizations from the rest of the cast with Andrew Robinson stealing his scenes as a barber who really enjoys shaving the heads of the cadets. In fact I loved the little ponytails hung on the walls of his salon. A neat little addition. The story is nothing special though, and the film is very formulaic.

34,FiendishDramaturgy,"Darker, but more hollow.",6,5 February 2004,"Did anyone else notice that Chucky has taken on a somewhat Jack Nicholson-esquire-ality about him these days, and perhaps because of that element, we learn right off that we must not f*ck with the Chuck! This time, in a military prep school, Andy is the hero, instead of the victim.What I like most about these movies is that they do not attempt to recreate one another. They play like one, long movie, when played back to back. This installment is no exception, and a deserving sequel.However, I somehow did not care for this movie as much as the first two. It is modernized, and they tried a bit bigger budget here, which spoiled the camp of the first two. They tried to add more of the suspenseful aspects of the originals to this one, and in My opinion, they fell a bit short in doing so. It does, however, have a darker feel and there is more gore (one of the sequel rules), but somehow it just falls a little beneath the others.I think perhaps that it is due to the vulgar language used by Chucky. It makes him come of as an obnoxious bad little child, rather than the serial killer/voodoo bocur he was in the first two. It degrades his character's worth and makes it appear superficial, rather than the deeply disturbed psychopath who is trapped in the body of a doll, and is slowly going insane from the frustration given to him by Andy in the first two installments. I mean...what guy wouldn't go insane from the total lack of their wedding tackle? The added darker elements should have made this one a better endeavor, but for Me, there's something missing. But it's still enjoyable, suspenseful, and even tense at times, with a darker atmosphere.6.3/10 from...the Fiend :.",Child's Play 3

A Decent Sequel & Ends The ""Andy"" Trilogy.",7,3 August 2021,"Justin Whalin is decent as the teenager version of Andy Barkley although he's very girly lookin at times but does pull off the lost & venerable role of a very troubled Andy who is now at a Military school. This is the last of the proper Child's Play films, the original old school Trilogy that i remember being such big films when they came out on video & i can still picture the posters in the window of my local little video store, so i habe huge Nostalgia for the first three films of this franchise. All the other new & silly sequels have been terrible & just vile comedies with nothing good about them right up until the Awesome Reboot/Remake of ""Child's Play"" so yeah part 3 here i recently watched for the first time in about 20 years & i gotta say i enjoyed it.I liked the 8 years later & army school setting to the story & i liked a teenage version of Andy in a different environment & this time tougher & ready for to face Chucky. Standout characters are of course Andy & the tough & brave De Silva, she's a smart mouth & tough chick who takes a liking to Andy & she's one of the best characters in the movie.The rest of the cast are all fine in their roles & play typical character types such as the skinny cowardly wimp with glasses & the mean bully drill sergeant type & so on.What stands out though is the huge setting of the dark looking Military school with its long dark corridors at night & many rooms to hide Chucky.The image of Chucky creeping down one of those hallways at night holding a big knife is still pretty creepy to be honest.The music score was decent & the cinematography was rich & the cold winter setting makes every feel darker, moodier & raw like the first Classic film did.I also really enjoyed the action-packed third act of the film with the Army games in the cold night time woods & then all the action during the big colourful fun fair amusement place, those are good set-pieces & exciting moments. Now it's not the best Chucky film, i like the Classic first best & then the fun sequel, but this 3rd film is definitely alot better than i remembered it. The not so good parts are the very annoying wimp i mentioned earlier & the really dumb little boy who befriends Chucky as both characters are annoying & really dumb. As for the killer doll Chucky, well he's fun & savage as usual.I can't help having alot of Nostalgia for these first 3 films & i just enjoy them & love those times they were made & they're such fun late-night flicks.Child's Play 3 is a fun sequel & the last of the Andy story.",Child's Play 3
38,dwpollar,Scary and well-done 3rd entry in the evil-doll Chucky series...,6,16 September 2006,"1st watched 9/16/2006 - 6 out of 10(Dir-Jack Bender): Scary and well-done 3rd entry in the evil-doll Chucky series. There is just enough sick humor, and genuinely scary moments to recommend this movie. The director does a good job of pulling us into the story, even for those who haven't seen the first two; like me. We understand what's going on with very little expose' into the first two. The puppetry work is just what the doctor ordered with Brad Dourif as the voice of Chucky; aka Charles(the former mass murderer who somehow was put inside this doll's body). He is reborn when the toy manufacturer decides to bring back the ""Good Guy"" doll series and his goal is to get out of the doll's body and into a human one. He hunts down his former owner, who is now 16 years old, at a military school and start wreaking havoc from this point on. Suttle performances by the actors without too much over-the-top violence makes this movie entertaining without being a gross-out experience. And forgive me, but it's hard not to laugh when Chucky spouts out obscenities in this doll's body. It's just ironic enough to make you giggle. The Chucky performance sells the show, but just the way this movie is put together keeps you on your toes and looking forward to other entries in the series.",Child's Play 3

Now, don't get me wrong, I still laughed a fair amount in this film, which is why I still plan to watch some of the sequels, plus, by most accounts this is the worst of the ""Child's Play"" series. Just how bad is it? Well, from all aspects- acting, directing, writing, the overall story- all of those aspects are terrible. What does that leave? Absolutely nothing. There's really nothing redeeming about this movie... unless you've got a twisted sense of humor, which, thankfully, I do.",Child's Play 3
42,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,It shows its diminishing returns although it's still watchable,6,22 June 2014,"As clearly stated by Don Mancini, the creator of the Child's Play franchise, Universal studios pushed him to begin writing a screenplay for this movie before Child's Play 2 (1990) was even ready to go. Thus, the result was that Mancini had no ideas left on how to continue the story of Charles Lee Ray, stuck in a Good Guy Doll's body. I mean can you blame him? It was baffling enough how in the name of all that's holy how to bring back Chucky from the original Child's Play (1988). Instead of being disassembled, Chucky's head was blown off this time. How do you bring someone back after that? Mancini found a way, but it's certainly not as forgivable as it was for the first sequel.The story surprisingly makes good use of its history and starts off with showing the aged and dusty factory of where the finale of the last film ended. There, the headless body of Chucky is melted down and remade. This apparently brings him back again. The continuity is great but how is that though? It was acceptable to a point in Child's Play 2 (1990) because the original body of Chucky was just dismembered and was cleaned off and reassembled. But to be first, missing a head, being melted down entirely and then remade? As much as the first resurrection was preposterous, the idea worked. Here, it just felt like a quick way to get Chucky back up. It's not like fans wouldn't want him back but a better method of rebirth would've been appreciated.Once up and running again, the lakeshore strangler immediately finds out where Andy Barclay is, but his plans abruptly change gears. Before he finds Andy, Chucky meets a new youngster named Tyler (who's also friends with Andy). There he decides that Tyler will be his new host. The new Andy is played by Justin Whalin, who later played Jimmy Olsen in the TV series, Lois and Clark. Whalin plays Andy as a sixteen-year-old, now in military school. Well that was a quick jump in time. One year passes between films and more than half a decade whizzes by our main protagonist. Whalin looks like he could be the older version of actor Alex Vincent (who originally played Andy) so that works. But what happened to Kyle from the last film? Much of the continuity is faithful to its predeceasing stories but the small things should be paid attention to as well. Instead of Kyle, Andy befriends another girl named De Silva (Perrey Reeves), there they form a friendly relationship in a tough school. The depiction of military school isn't as accurate as one would think here. Yes, there are drills and loud commands spouted out from superior officers but as a whole, it doesn't feel as intense as it could be. Nevertheless, Andy is the only character who believes Chucky still lives. Meanwhile, he's bullied by his superiors and fellow soldiers. No surprise there, nobody wants to be friends with Andy. It's sad, but at least this is the final film involving Chucky going after Barclay.Its not needed to be said but Brad Dourif of course entertains as Chucky. His dialog is still funny and you can't help but enjoy his performance as the angry doll that can't cut a break with finding a body to inhabit. More interesting is seeing actor Andrew Robinson from Clive Barker's Hellraiser (1987) have a small role as a barber to the school. His performance isn't memorable but is comical because as a barber to a military school, his obsession with keeping short hair goes beyond normalcy. He's just crazy about keeping short hair, a little too often. For gore, the violence feels in the middle to that of the first two movies. Nothing goes all out ugly like it did in Child's Play 2 (1990), but it's also not as tame as the violence in Child's Play (1988). Either way, it's intriguing to see what twisted methods Chucky has in store this time. The cinematography is mostly competent by John R. Leonetti. What he captures on screen isn't anything beautiful but there are times where the landscape is big which helps it feel like the place Andy is in, isn't a small school. Leonetti would go on to provide camera work for many Dead Silence (2007), The Mask (1994) and The Conjuring (2013). As for music, John D'Andrea and Cory Lerios score is a mixed bag. Instead of Graeme Revells more robust orchestral score from Child's Play 2 (1990), these TV composers revert back to Synthetic tones like that of Joe Renzetti's from the original composition of Child's Play (1988). Yet, without a main theme, this duo at least kept the music sounding creepy. It's hard to say. It's obvious that this production was rushed with its plot being dragged out on the same character but at least its tone didn't change.Its plot is recycled again and its justification for certain events are totally ignored but the main grab is to see how Andy and Chucky duke it out for the final time. It could've been written much worse by comparison.",Child's Play 3

45,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Child's Play 3""- Chucky gets... kinda lazy and repetitive, actually!",3,1 October 2016,"Whelp! At least they tried... I guess.Yeah, unfortunately after a pretty stellar original and an uncommonly strong first follow-up, the ""Child's Play"" series started it's third go-around with not so much as a skip-and-a-hop... but more of a stumble and splat. Suffering a wildly rushed production period and an admittedly strained and stressed series creator forced to lop together a script in record-time, ""Child's Play 3"" is one of those sequels that just never quite comes together and never really seems to know where it's going. It tries to be a decent sequel... I will give it credit there. But it's trying despite the fact there's just no energy or motivation to support its attempts at delivering a satisfying follow-up.We begin a handful of years after the climactic and apocalyptic finale of ""Child's Play 2"", as the Good Guys doll factory is re- opened and Chucky (voiced by Brad Dourif) is inadvertently brought back to life. Once again seeking to swap his soul into nemesis Andy Barklay (now played by Justin Whalin), Chucky follows him to his new home in a Military Academy. However, realizing that his new body will allow him to bend the rules of his voodoo curse and find a new human subject to take hold of, Chucky sets his sights on Tyler (Jeremy Sylvers), who has befriended Andy. And so, Andy must try and protect his young friend with the help of the beautiful Kristin (Perrey Reeves) and his other new friend Harold Whitehurst. (Dean Jacobson)Series creator Don Mancini once again writes the script, and he has been pretty candid on the failings of the film. Universal, knowing the cash-cow that the franchise had the potential to be, pushed Mancini and the other creative minds behind the series to turn around and creature a third film in a pretty unheard-of amount of time- just nine months after the last outing. And of course this studio-logic backfired on a grand scale, as the film seems far more scattershot and unfocused as a result of such a rushed production. It introduces new ideas and a few fun high-concept set-pieces... but fails to utilize or even properly establish them much of the time. It throws in some really fascinating scenes of humor and horror that function well enough on their own... but never quite come together as a cohesive story on the whole. And it brings up a lot of fun, archetypal characters... but never quite allows you to connect with them beyond a few short scenes here and there. While I do think that Mancini did an admirable job with the amount of time he had, you just can't help but notice how much it doesn't work.Though to be fair, I must give credit where it is due. And a big part of what does work is thanks to the cast. Whalin makes for a compelling replacement as Barklay, now older and suffering the tragic effects of his childhood traumas. Whalin actually feels quite organic in the role, even if he isn't the world's greatest actor, and you could definitely see the child from the first two growing up into him. Dourif as always is a joy to behold in what has now become perhaps his most iconic role. I really appreciated that they give him a bit more range here to stretch his chops thanks to a handful of genuinely comedic moments. Sylvers makes for a very fun and fairly compelling child-actor, and he's probably the best in the entire series, making Tyler endlessly likable even when he can occasionally come across as a bit bratty like most kids. Perrey Reeves is absolutely adorable as Andy's new love-interest and also comes across as more than just a damsel in distress- something the series has been quite good at avoiding through most of it's thus-far six chapters. And even for his limited time, Dean Jacobson is a lot of fun as Andy's sort-of new best friend who gets dragged along for the ride.I also must give credit for director Jack Bender's solid visual choices. Now known mostly for his work on popular TV-franchises such as ""Lost"" and ""Game of Thrones"", Bender has a keen visual eye and really lends his talents to making the few strong and stand-out scenes work. Particularly admirable is the wickedly entertaining climax taking place in a nearby carnival. While it never quite reaches the depraved brilliance of part two's doll-factory finale, this film nonetheless crafts a fiendish and wicked setting for the final showdown.Still, it all comes back to that rushed production and rushed script. Strong performances and solid sequences are key... but when they just don't come together, it doesn't matter. Say what you will about other entries in the franchise, to me, this is probably the ""Child's Play"" series at its weakest. For all the fan complaints about it, even ""Seed of Chucky"" was at least a far more ambitious and cohesive experience. ""Child's Play 3""? It's just a dull repetition of what came before.Perhaps appropriate in some perverse way, I give ""Child's Play 3"" a sub-par 3 out of 10. At least the previous sequel and it's self- aware follow-up in ""Bride of Chucky"" more than make up for its failings.",Child's Play 3

48,IonicBreezeMachine,Uses its military school setting to good effect and does enough with Chucky to justify itself.,6,19 October 2021,"8 years after Chucky's (Brad Dourif) second demise at the Good Guys factory, Chucky is once again brought back to life when Play Palz Toyz decides to relaunch the Good Guy doll and the plastic from Chucky's former body is molded into a new one. Andy Barclay (Justin Whalin), now 16 years old, having been deemed problematic by the foster system is enrolled in Kent Military Academy until his 18th birthday. Andy finds friends in cadets Whitehurst (Dean Jacobson) and De Silva (Perrey Reeves), but also must contend with the antagonistic nature of Cadet Lt. Col Shelton (Travis Fine). Chucky mails himself to the academy intent on using Andy as a vessel, but when Chucky's package is intercepted by a younger cadet named Tyler (Jeremy Sylvers), Chucky decides to set his sights on Tyler instead leading Andy to once again square off against Chucky.Following the success of Child's Play 2, Universal immediately greenlit a sequel with turnaround time of only 9 months between releases of Child's Play 2 and 3. Originally intended to experiment with the concept of multiple ""Chuckies"", this idea was scrapped due to budgetary constraints. Screenwriter and series creator Don Mancini jumped the series timeline ahead 8 years after by his admission having run out of ideas with Child's Play 2 and often looks upon Child's Play 3 as his least favorite in the series. While the formula is well established by this point and some scenes do call to mind similar setups from Child's Play 2, Child's Play 3 for a ""obligation"" movie is still pretty entertaining.The movie's military school setting is about as subtle as a sledgehammer and taps all the tropes and trappings associated with the formula (meek roommate, bullying superior, hazing, etc.) but it works well for protagonist Andy Barclay in terms of isolating him from help or safety when Chucky once again does his routine. Jeremy Sylvers and Perrey Reeves do well as Andy's friends even if they don't really evolve beyond their established type of beaten down whipping boy and bad girl respectively and Reeves did occasionally come off a little wooden. One of the points Mancini had against Child's Play 3 was in the casting of Jeremy Sylvers as Tyler because he seemed a bit too old and it's not an unfair criticism. While Sylvers does as well as expected he does seem like he was written with someone maybe a few years younger in mind. And then we have the Military School ""bully"" characters and they basically devour the parts of the movie that Chucky is generous enough to leave.Our first introduction is Andrew Robinson as Sgt. Botnick, the Academy Barber who cackles and quips about trimming the cadets hair with complete with a leery grin and a catch phrase of ending every trimming session with ""now you're bald""(even when they clearly aren't). And then of course we have Travis Fine as Lt. Col Shelton who goes full force with his bullying control freak persona to a ridiculous degree that almost makes Dourif seem reserved by comparison. Speaking of Dourif, he's still decent as Charles Lee Ray/Chucky, but there is a noticeable decline in the sharpness in both his kills and his quips with the opening scene where he says the off quoted ""don't f--- with the Chuck"" feeling like it was specifically made for the trailer rather than tailored for the character or situation. Despite this, the movie's doll effects are still on point, and despite the climax set inside a carnival funhouse being very similar to the Good Guy factory from Child's Play 2 it's still a visually interesting sequence with some strong effects work and production design on display.Child's Play 3 shakes up its setting and characters to mostly successful effect. While the movie does tread ground of the first two films and has all but abandoned what attempts at subtlety it may have had, there's still some strong work from most of the cast, some impactful kill scenes, and some good effects/production work. If you enjoyed the first two Child's Play films, you'll definitely find more of what you loved here.",Child's Play 3

50,hnt_dnl,Odd franchise film in more ways than one,3,7 November 2021,"CHILD'S PLAY 3 is an oddity in the Chucky franchise. It came out only 1 year after Child's Play 2, yet is set 8 years in the future. So now Andy is a teenager and a dubious one at that. The ""actor"" chosen to play Teen Andy looks like the typical bland 90s pretty boy from Teen Beat magazine, not an emotionally scarred individual whose been terrorized by a killer doll for half his life. This movie would hold up a lot better if a different actor had been playing the teenaged Andy. It's also jarring that all the other teenagers in this movie are obviously played by young adults, so Andy stands out even more due to that. The romance between Andy and the female cadet DeSilva is creepy as the actress looks several years older than him and way more mature. It's literally watching a woman kissing a boy.The movie also has so many head-scratching moments. Why did Andy spend the bulk of the movie messing around with Chucky when he could have just killed him? He saw the Commandant holding Chucky then literally acted like he didn't see it. Then later in the movie, the Cadet Four Eyes did the same thing when he saw that Chucky killed the barber. Just ignored it like it didn't happen and failed to tell anyone what he saw. Why were the female cadets allowed to wear their hair long and not bunned up on a MILITARY base? Why did DeSilva get off with just pushups for the insult she made to the jerk Cadet Colonel? She insulted him LOUDLY in front of an entire battalion and that's her punishment? Speaking of said jerk, what's with the fake country accent? Is this some stereotype for gruff military leaders? Why was virtually every character obsessed with this doll? The little kid fails to give it to Andy, the girls just play around with it putting lipstick on it, the cadet bully basically steals it from Andy then gets mad when he thinks Andy took back what was rightfully his anyway. But the kicker was the barber tried to give Chucky a haircut! Aside from the kid, these are basically grown people playing with a doll. Why did Glasses just jump on the grenade killing himself instead of throwing it into the woods? And finally, why exactly was Andy arrested in the end and what happened to the little kid? Did the police think Andy committed all the murders? The thing is that I low-key liked the new setting, but the dubious casting for Andy and all the plot illogic sunk it.",Child's Play 3

I love this film I saw it as a child and didn't see it over 20 years but I today I just finished re watching it. Why is this movie people's least favorite film? hmm to me it was a great end of the trilogy and these three Child's Play movies are the only the real Chucky films in my opinion. Why these movie get's the worst rating? I don't get it. I will tell you this, it is MILES way better than all three Maniac Cop films! Maniac Cop 3 was worse than Child's Play 3 in my opinion!Justin Whalin did great job as Andy Barclay he was good in this. Jeremy Sylvers as Tyler was really good I really love this film, good slasher film. Perrey Reeves was a hot babe in this. The plot continues in which part 2 ended and evolves about Chucky's revenge on Andy who comes back to finish what he started in Child's Play 2. This time we see Andy a 16 year old teen in the military school I absolutely love Justin Whalin and I had a fun watching this film. I think the hate get's because the film wasn't that scary and dark enough like the first two were. It get's thumbs down by fans because it has a humor in it and the death scenes are not that quit well done. Well Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives has also humor in it and Jason walks like zombie in that film and to me it is still q great sequel. So Child's Play 3 to me is entertaining well paced I love Andy the character I easily rooted for him than evil Chucky. Why is this film a waste of time are you that stupid? This movie is not a waste of time in my opinion I had a blast of watching it. If you didn't that's your opinion we agree to disagree. You know what people F*** Bride of Chucky! I will not buy that stupid film anyway I will take this film over Maniac Cop 3 and Bride of Chucky anytime. Screw the next three movies. I will watch the last two movies alongside with Bride of Chucky and I will review them all and I will give my final thoughts on them. The third film is unappreciated and bashed from fan boys it is impossible for them to accept this horror slasher third solid film. The plot evolves around about eight years has passed since the events of the second film, Andy is now a teenager and has been enrolled in a military school. Play Pals Toy Company decides to re-release its Good Guys line, feeling that after all this time, the bad publicity has died down. As they re-used old materials, the spirit of Charles Lee Ray once again comes to life. In his search for Andy, Chucky falls into the hands of a younger boy, and he realizes that it may be easier to transfer his soul into this unsuspecting child. Andy is the only one who knows what Chucky is up to, and it's now up to him to put a stop to it.Some people are asking how did Chucky try to put the sole in the next kid when in the second one he couldn't do it. I think in the second one couldn't do it because he waited too long for his soul to put it in that kid. I think in this film there are new rules and I think if Chucky told another boy his secret the rules have changed and he is in the beginning again, that he was before that is my explanation. I am not an expert I just think that's how the movie is. A+ 9/10 it is not boring, over long, it is fast paced and goes quickly around. I loved it, it is not better than the first two but it is still solid excellent sequel to watch. Just like RoboCop 2 and Rambo III this sequel is very underrated and bashed from haters. Those three films I like and I will watch them anytime.Child's Play 3 is a 1991 American supernatural slasher film. It is the third installment in the Child's Play series.

56,fernandoschiavi,Changing its premises for convenience and challenging viewer disbelief too much. The only attraction of the film is the villain,5,9 July 2021,"In the second episode of the series, it was established that the doll could die at will and they would always find a way to bring it back to life. There, Chucky had been destroyed by Andy and Kyle at the toy factory after being cast in liquid plastic. In this film directed by Jack Bender we see eight years after the events of the previous film, the young Andy Braclay, now 16 years old and entering a military school after going through several adoptive families and not being able to adapt in any of them, still traumatized by the events of your past. But the toy company believed that, after all this time, the bad publicity due to the tragic events was over. So, she remanufactures the doll from the old material, which has once again brought the spirit of Lakeshore's strangler assassin back to life. However, when looking for its former owner and discovering he was enrolled in school, the doll falls into the hands of another boy, Tyler and Chucky find it easier to transfer his soul to him, but he didn't count on the former owner, Andy, knowing that the assassin's spirit was alive again and intended to finish him off again.With a slew of nonsense and downright surreal scenes, this is the most hated movie in the series, even more than Son of Chucky. Don Mancini himself doesn't like Child's Play 3, saying he was forced to write the script in a hurry even before part 2 was done. This explains the amount of holes and forced situations. Does that mean the movie is a complete bombshell? No way! The best compliment to Child's Play 3 is to consider it a guilty pleasure, which puts us in a new situation and in a completely different scenario.The change of environment from one film to another, even though it was a good 'renewal' proposal, was not effective, mainly because it provided absurd scenes involving Chucky. The villain chased the little boy Andy in familiar surroundings, and here the action takes place on a military base as well as in a forest. The script is the most strained and meaningless of the trilogy, showing scenes that are really hard to swallow. For a start, it's hard to believe that Chucky does what he wants in a place full of military personnel, without even anyone noticing his movements, which, let's face it, is the least important factor for the script. The villain appears everywhere, is everywhere, killing some characters in creative ways and to some extent with ingenious kills.In a military environment, consequently with easy access to the most diverse weapons, objects and interesting scenarios, but what we see are typical clichés full of completely predictable and less bloody deaths. Chuchy is sharper than ever, with Brad Dourif delivering a lot of the funniest lines in the character's history. The killing eats loose, always allied with high doses of black humor, almost always resulting in ridiculous and absurd scenes. The villain exchanging Paintball bullets for real bullets is one of the scenes that proves the film's mood. No character in the film has any characteristics that make them different. All are uninteresting and characterless, although in the previous film only Andy and Kyle escape this label.The way Chucky comes back to life is also one of the most ridiculous ways in the script. His 'remnants' were found in the factory of the previous film, years later, and when a machine removes them from the scene, his blood (Amazing to still have blood, isn't it?) falls into a liquid plastic tank, and with the contact of both, the doll is reborn. Simple isn't it? Now why the doll came back to life after having its blood mixed with plastic, no one will ever know. What does one thing have to do with the other? Another big scoop in the script is the ease with which Chucky discovers Andy's whereabouts. Simply, after consulting the computer of the boss of the industry that makes the toys, Sullivan (Peter Haskell), Chucky finds out where the boy is. The question is why Andy's name is on the tycoon's computer, even after years of incidents involving both.From there, visualize the first half of Born to Kill with a killer doll in the middle. Chucky spends a lot of time killing people who don't matter, which only delays his plan to switch bodies with Tyler. In the end, the scenario changes completely, from the jungle where the soldiers are in training to an amusement park (which is in the middle of the bush!) where the final confrontation against Chucky takes place. The climax takes place in a Tunnel of Terror, and it's interesting. The problem is that it completely clashes with the rest of the movie. It seems that Don Mancini had the idea of a climax in the park in his drawer and decided to somehow graft it onto the film.The most curious thing is the completely inexplicable passages. In the second film, Chucky tried to transfer his soul to Andy, but he couldn't complete the process as his time was up. Here, this is completely ignored. That's without counting that they had to invent that he had gotten a new body to justify the new target, the boy Tyler. But in the second movie, wasn't it also completely rebuilt by hand by the manufacturer? Why did he have to go after Andy if he could reveal his secret to anyone else? Speaking of the trashiest part of the franchise, the deaths have a certain creativity, like Colonel Cochrane, who, upon seeing Chucky has a heart attack and the doll says ""You must be kidding me!"", or the death of the hairdresser who after passing the razor on the man's neck, Chucky gives his devilish laugh followed by the following sentence: ""Ready! You're dead!"", (Someone else noticed that this line is the same as Chucky does to Mattson after shooting him in the face with a water pistol in ""The Child's Play 2?"", but in none of them the director manages to create any suspense in the audience.Another aspect that was left out of this movie was the ""time"" factor. While in the first two movies Chucky had a short time to transfer his soul into Andy's body, in this movie there is no such time. Over the course of the film, we see Chucky getting hurt, bleeding and giving the impression that (just like in part 2), he's a doll only on the outside, but inside, he's a complete human anatomy. But, in fact, we don't see the doll in a hurry to want to leave the body for fear of getting stuck in it, it just wants to leave because it doesn't want to be a doll.In addition to all the aforementioned flaws, the soundtrack by John D'Andrea and Cory Lerios doesn't have the same shine as the previous ones, the deaths are much less inspired (as mentioned before) and we really miss the horror and the atmosphere of suspense so well used by Tom Holland in the first film. Child's Play 3 fails to interest and that's where the problem lies. Losing the air of novelty, there is little to do with the character and the script, at least he no longer bothers to create so much suspense. However, as the story does not please, Chucky ends up being the only interesting thing.However, time seems to last an eternity due to scenes where the doll is not present. The problem is that Chucky is supposed to be the villain, but he ends up being the protagonist of the story. Also, the supporting characters are not interesting and sound extremely cliché and even boring, like young Tyler. Besides the actor not having any charisma, Tyler's personality is what irritates the most. Despite being around 10 years old, he acts like a dazzled five-year-old. He is childish and naive in the extreme. He talks to a doll that was out of batteries and making a demon face as if he were talking to anyone without ever realizing the risk and the doll's intentions, and even when he demonstrates it is very artificial and does not convince anyone.Child's Play 3 is the conclusion of a natural process most of the time when it comes to trilogies, since most of the time they lose their quality because they don't know how to reinvent themselves. While Child's Play 2 looks almost like a copy of the first one, only a little worse, this one invented and changed things too much, changing its premises for convenience and challenging viewer disbelief too much. The only attraction of the film is the villain, which may not be worth the pain of scenes where he is not present.That's why it doesn't work, and, standing on the fence, it's the worst movie in the series. Who, without a doubt, saves the film is the Chucky doll, who, even in the face of an unfavorable tide, manages to impose himself and hold the viewer until the end. Otherwise, it's all the same, but worse. Chucky is reborn, kills, goes after Andy, kills people on the way, finds Andy, kills more people, kills some more, kills, kills, kills, Andy tries to fend off Chucky, climax, Andy is about to lose until he hits way to destroy the doll, Chucky dies, but it's only in this movie, as it will certainly return in the near future.

57,swilliky,A step down to end the Child's Play trilogy,4,30 October 2017,"The Child's Play trilogy tops out with a new setting and an old er protagonist. After the events of the first two films, the toy company that produces the Good Guy doll is trying to make a financial recovery and they can't do that without their best selling product, despite the terrible press. The same plastic that consisted of Chucky was melted down and used to make the new dolls. Chucky (Brad Dourif) wakes up in the highrise apartment of the toy company executive Sullivan (Peter Haskell) and uses the surrounding toys including marble and a yo-yo to trip and strangle the old man. Chucky looks up the whereabouts of his one ticket out of being a doll, Andy Barclay (Justin Whalin). Andy has been shipped out to military school where he is roommates with a nerd Whitehurst (Dean Jacobson) and is bullied by the drill leader Shelton (Travis Fine).Chucky sends himself in a package to the school where he is intercepted from delivery by a young boy Tyler (Jeremy Sylvers). Chucky tries to take the boys soul but the ceremony is interrupted by Colonel Cochrane (Dakin Matthews) who throws the doll away. Chucky smashes the garbage man in the dumpster and sneaks into Andy's room. Andy tries to smash Chucky but Shelton walks in and takes the doll back to his room. Andy sneaks into Shelton's room that night to find Chucky but the doll is missing along with a knife. Shelton exacts punishment on all the cadets making Andy a pariah. Tyler plays hide-and-seek with the knife-wielding Chucky but they are discovered by De Silva (Perrey Reeves) and her friend. They put lipstick on Chucky which enrages the demented children's toy.

59,manitobaman81,Good,7,22 August 2014,"Chucky, the doll possessed by a serial killer, returns for revenge against Andy, the young boy that defeated him and has since become adult. In Child's Play 3, the cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. The film is dark, brooding, intense and most of all violent Chucky is a foul-mouthed doll who will kill you and yours and laugh while doing it! Ohhh, Chucky, you are going to go down, pal!",Child's Play 3
60,acidburn-10,The weakest entry in the entire series,5,21 March 2009,"Andy, this time a teenager is in military school and guess whose not far behind our fave doll ""Chucky"" again going on a murderous rampage military style.This is definitely the weakest entry out off all the Chucky films, released a year after the 2nd one, rushed out and it shows, the storyline is weak and plus it performed poorly at the box office and there are way too many parts in this movie that are unbelievable I didn't buy Chuck not needing Andy any more and finding a newfound target/host. In Part 2, Chucky was also rebuilt with new plastic. Why didn't the ""Good Guy"" think of that then? Andy should've stayed Chuck's main goal cause the Tyler (Sylvers) crap got played out real fast.Setting the film in a military school is a good idea but why didn't they milk it more?Another thing: having an amusement park right next to a military academy is hard to swallow. On the grounds they handle guns, grenades, what-not, and there's no way they would build a park near all that. The only reason the park is there is so the movie can have a groovy location in which to set its finale. felt kind of cheap. Speaking of the finale, the haunted house is kool but what's up with that huge open fan or that Grim Reaper that swooshes his ""real"" blade at the kids. This park is just begging to get closed down.This sequel also repeats Part Two's biggest mistake. Most of the side characters are solely there to be Chucky meat fodder and I knew that. One thing I didn't need was overextended stalk sequences involving characters I couldn't give a damn about. Take the opening murder for example. It takes forever to get to the point! I was yelling out loud: Kill the guy already! I know he's going to die; you don't have to take 10 minutes to get to the killing! The film not a total loss though Chucky is still his usual humorous self and does his best despite the lazy script.Justin Whalin plays Andy this time around He has a baby face that works and he shows the right amount of vulnerability. Perrey Reeves (De Silva) is solid as the tough chick Jeremy Sylvers (Tyler) does oBrad Dourif (Voice of Chucky) does it again, his squeaky voice never gets old.All in all only Hardcore Chucky fans will get a kick out of this others will find this movie unsatisfactory.",Child's Play 3
61,Darkside-Reviewer,"""Nothing like a good strangulation to get the circulation going""",6,26 October 2019,Released just one year after Child's Play 2 this movie shakes things up a little taking place 8 years after the events of Child's Play 2 when Andy Barkley is a teenager and having failed to settle in with foster family's has been sent to a military school to straighten him out and ends up finding out that the school is full of bullies and the staff are no better letting young cadets be abused by a teenage lieutenant who enjoys bullying anyone who isn't what he judges to be military worthy and after just a few days in hell Andy Barkleys worst nightmare comes back once again Chucky now with a new body tracks Andy down to the school to finish what he started but this time he doesn't need Andy alive and in his way of possessing a new hosts body for his soul.While this movie isn't the best in the franchise it certainly isn't the worst and it has some very memorable one liners from Chucky and ties up the Andy Barkley original trilogy storyline pretty nicely while giving Chucky more personality and new environments to cause mayhem in.The puppetry effects still look great even in 2019 with great facial expressions and movements that make Chucky more detailed and scary looking when he moves and talks.I recommend this movie to any horror movie fan and fans of the Chucky franchise while not the best Chucky movie its still a lot of fun to watch.,Child's Play 3

63,TalesfromTheCryptfan,A decent entry in the franchise and the last one worth a damn!,7,12 November 2017,"In 1998, 8 years after the events of the last film and after years of negative publicity about the Good Guy Dolls that involved the Chucky case with Andy Barclay, the factor has been doing strong over the years with other products and before the incident their good guy dolls were the hottest selling toys on the market that outsold their other toys. CEO Mr Sullivan (Peter Haskell) decides to get rid of the memory of Andy Barclay and his killer Good Guy Doll story to bring back the Good Guy doll on the market for the 90s at his company, thus it's reopened and he receives a Good Guy doll that is actually Chucky brought back to life as now the little terror discovers that Andy is at a military school. Andy (Justin Whalin) is 16 years old as he wants to get on with his life to forget those ""fantasies of killer dolls"" as his mother is still in psychiatric care even fail to cope to live in foster homes and the place is ran by Colonel Cochran (Dakin Matthews) who is in charge of the place. He befriends new friends like Tyler (Jeremy Slyvers), Whitehurst (Dean Jacobson) and Kirstin Desilla (Perrey Reeves) whom he develops romantic feelings for. Chucky has used the company's computer records to find where Andy is at and sends himself to Kent Military School, yet meets Tyler as Chucky finds out he has a new body and hasn't told anyone his secret and makes friends with Tyler as he wants to use him for a vessel to take over his soul. Andy must hunt down the little killer from taking over the boy's body.A weak sequel to the first 2 movies and considered inferior to the second movie but very enjoyable and the last truly good Chucky movie worth a damn. After the success of Child's Play 2, Universal green-lighted a third movie and was rushed into production for a summer of 1991 release and Don Mancini wrote the script in a week. Jack Bender who did TV movies made a theatrical release here and his direction is fairly OK at best and Mancini's writing is OK but has some good lines like when Chucky says ""Don't F with the chuck"" or ""Presto Your Dead"" when he murders the barber. Andrew Robinson from Hellraiser/Dirty Harry co-stars in this one as Sgt. Botnik and Travis Fine as Lt. Shelton as this sequel is not as bad as some people made out to be. But for me personally i think it's the last Child's Play movie worth a damn before it went all down hill no thanks to Mancini. The film did became notorious in the UK for 2 murders it ""supposedly"" spawned like the murder of 3 year old James Buldger back in 1993 by two 11 year olds whom the Tabloids blamed this movie on the murder but neither saw the film before the murder and saw it only afterwards. There was also the Suzanne Capper case which 2/3 were involved by demented killers who tortured her listening to recordings of ""Hi i'm chucky wanna play"" before burning her alive and killing her. That's awful what happened but you can't blame the movies for those insane psychopaths who committed such horrible murders, like Scream says ""Movies don't make psychos"".The puppetry/animatronics by Kevin Yagher feels a step down from the previous film and is OK at best yet the gore effects are quite good especially when Chucky gets half his face sliced off to look like Pizza with no cheese to the death of the barber. Originally Jonathan Brandis was suppose to play teen Andy yet the role won to Justin Whalin who did a good job playing the character well. There is a fun climax set in a theme park which is quite thrilling i gotta say.",Child's Play 3
64,Beejerman,CHEER! - (8 stars out of 10),8,11 January 2020,"The stage curtains open ...In this 3rd entry into the franchise, Chucky runs wild in a Military Academy causing more havoc and chaos in a way that only he can. Back is Brad Dourif as the voice of the maniacal doll - and he delivers delightful, evil fun yet again. You are treated to more of Chucky's sneers, wicked laughter, and little doll stalking. So, basically, this is another fun Child's Play movie that holds to a formula that works.It's 8 years after the events of the 2nd film, and Andy Barclay is now 16 years old and a bit of a trouble case. After spending time in foster home after foster home, he is finally shoved into Kent Military Academy and it isn't long before Chucky finds his way there. This time, though, Chucky is after a different boy and it is up to Andy and his new military friends to save the day. But not before Chucky is able to play his murderous hijinks and leave behind him a new wake of bodies.I love these movies! Of the first three films in the series, this is probably the weakest one, but it still holds up pretty well. Some of the dialogue is unforgivable, but I forgave it anyway. Bringing our killer doll to a military school opened up a new range of kills and opportunities that was a welcome change to the series. Brad Dourif nailed it again. Only he can deliver such a fun voice-over for the creepy doll that everyone just loves. I also enjoyed the fact that they moved further down the timeline, bringing us a teenage Andy Barclay. This was a good move.For fans of the Child's Play movies, this is a must watch. For the casual horror fan, it is a high recommend. I would suggest you watch the first two movies before watching this one (if you haven't yet seen them). It isn't crucial to the timeline, but some of the humor in this film will make better sense. This one comes in at a strong 8 stars out of 10.",Child's Play 3
65,Rickting,A good villain can only carry a weak screenplay so far,4,23 May 2016,"Child's Play 3 sees Chucky return 8 years after Child's Play 2. For some bizarre reason the film is set in a military academy, where Andy Barclay currently is. Unfortunately, rather than going after Andy Chucky's main target is an incredibly irritating child actor. Child's Play was a good horror film but the sequel was a boring rehash. This one is more watchable in some ways. Chucky is a very good villain as ever, and the film benefits from some welcome humour which allows the film to embrace the absurdity of its central concept. Much of the time you'll just laugh at it. Also, there is the odd effective jump scare, the central romance is quite cute and the finale is surprisingly effective. Unfortunately, CP3 is never particularly scary. In terms of plot it's incredibly underdeveloped and uninteresting, while most of the characters are cardboard. It's a pretty tame movie as well, which really doesn't earn its 18 certificate and at times feels like a gentle comedy with scary elements. It's a very silly film. In fairness, it's not unwatchable and at 90 minutes it passes quickly without a lot of impact. In terms of horror sequels, I've seen worse, but this is a representation of a franchise struggling to come up with anything fresh and denying the harsh reality: no-one really wants another sequel.4/10",Child's Play 3
66,baileycrawly,Not Great,6,26 October 2019,"This movie could've been a whole lot better. But it's really not the faint of the creative team behind it.
Universal picked up the Child's Play franchise with its second movie and, following the success of it, they immediately ordered a sequel to be produced rather quickly. In a bind to produce per their contract, the team came up with this movie, which isn't nearly as good as it should've been.
Alex Vincent, the brilliant young talent behind Andy Barclay, is gone now, replaced with an older Justin Whalen to allow for a time-jump in the story. Now, he's going to be in the army. He's surrounded by lots of people on the same level as him... but he still can't quite get closure on what happened to him as a child, and he can't shake the feeling that Chucky might still be out there.
This film, once again, has a creative way of killing off its villainous doll, but beyond that, there really isn't much of substance in this one. It feels about as dry and soulless as it really is; the studio's attempt to cash in on a profitable franchise.",Child's Play 3
67,nitzanhavoc,"Not good, just better.",6,27 March 2016,"Considering that I did not enjoy the first two films, the only reason I continued to part 3 (and will continue to watch all the films of the series) is that I want to experience the anthology as a whole. Also, I have certain hopes that the later films will be better... I must say, after a disappointing first and an atrocious sequel, Child's Play 3 is currently the best one I've seen of the series. First of all, Andy has finally grown up, meaning we were spared the unprofessional, uninspiring, unauthentic and unconvincing acting skills of Alex Vincent (again, sorry, I know he was just a kid, but have a look at all the amazing child actors and actresses of modern Horror who surpass Vincent in any and all ways possible). Having Justin Whalin (Jimmy from Lois and Clark!) as the main lead was almost enough to salvage the film. Almost.So, Chucky is alive again. How? Doesn't matter! Since nothing (absolutely nothing) about the films so far has been remotely reasonable or realistic, director Jack Bender and screenwriter Don Mancini had simply decided to avoid any explanations of how Chucky's soul was transferred to another (identical, of course) doll. Friendly reminder - in the 2nd film we learn that Chucky has been stuck in the doll for too long, and can no longer use the Dambella voodoo to move his soul to a live body. Never mind. Now there's a new doll, Chucky is conveniently stuck in it, why bother paying attention to plot holes?Now Chucky is on the loose again, and has a chance to finally settle the score with Andy, and move his soul to an older body which would allow him to enjoy the delicate pleasures of life. No! Chucky will instead choose another 7-9 year old as his target, because logic is redundant!So what's the good part? The characters (besides Whalin, the gorgeous Perrey Reeves is great as De Silva, adding a little romance to the tale, and Travis Fine is excellent as Shelto, the bully we all love to hate) are better, more intriguing and more relatable (not to mention better played). The story and plot are also better, because of the nice setting (a military school which in all things considered reminds the setting of Friday the 13th) and the increasing suspense. This time, instead of waiting for the next screw-up and for the film to finally end, I found myself actually curious as to how the events will eventually unfold.All in all? Not a good film in general, only by comparison to the first two. Still entertaining enough to deserve a merciful 6.",Child's Play 3

JASON. But onto the story, I for a party of one don't approve of military school, to me all it does it march the individuality right out of people and makes them mindless drones ripe to join the army when they are old enough. That's just wrong, people should choose to join the army and no become mindless drones. The characters are interesting, Chucky is always good and the Chucky effects are even better in this third installment of the series, of course as always, if you didn't like the first two CHILD'S PLAY movies, I wouldn't recommend this one.

69,emperor_bender,My favorite of the series for some reason,9,7 March 2008,"I'm going to comment hell for this one. This comment will most likely receive a very low ""useful"" rating, but I'm OK with that. This movie was quite possibly my favorite of the Child's Play series. And although you will probably not agree, you will see what I mean:This movie takes place 8 years after the previous. Andy is now a teen and has been sent to a military academy. And guess what: Chucky decided to tag along. This makes for a great story. Chucky really shows his true colors and sick, twisted sense of humor here. We also have an interesting group of characters here, who are actually worth mentioning. We have Andy of course, we have Tyler, a young cadet who catches Chucky's eye as a replacement of Andy; there's DeSilva, a tough girl who has a soft spot for Andy; we have Whitehurst, an outspoken, nerdy type who quickly befriends Andy; we have Shelton, a military-loving, tough, intimidating young man who has it in for Andy; and we have Botnik, an older guy, the barber who loves his job just a little too much. Together with these great characters is a great setting. There are some very interesting kills here which I have not even thought of or seen in any previous film. I do not understand why this movie is so underrated. Is it because of the time lapse? Maybe because Andy's not a kid? New setting? No matter what the reason, this movie deserves much more than a 4.1 rating (as of 3/7/08). I say it gets 9/10. Fans of the first 2 films will not want to miss this.",Child's Play 3
70,akshatmahajan,Normal as compared to first two,6,30 June 2021,"Child's Play 3 tried different concept but that didn't work. This movie is neither enjoyful nor thrilling, as first two parts. Some of you may not love to watch this movie again.Movie is set after 7- 8 years of second part. There were neither shocks nor scares, as there were in first two parts. The acting was below average. The direction was weak, could have been better. The pacing was normal. But what made first two parts different ie blend of horror and slasher was missing in this part.Overall, the movie disappointed me a little bit but I will recommend it to those who have watched first two parts as it is in continuation.",Child's Play 3
71,DigitalRevenantX7,Darkly humorous.,4,12 January 2010,"I never really liked CHILD'S PLAY. That film was a modern re-imagining of the classic possessed doll theme, which was so silly that it ended up making me laugh. Aside from one scene where Catherine Hicks checks the doll for batteries, the film failed to scare, not to mention having a few plot twists that were just plain bad. Nevertheless the film was a modest hit, which led to two sequels (which were actually better).Six years after his last confrontation with Chucky the possessed doll, Andy Barclay has been sent to a military school. At the same time, the Play Pals toy factory has restarted its manufacturing of Good Guy dolls. Chucky's soul possesses the first one built &, after killing the Play Pals' president, mails himself to the military school. Andy must now try once again to defeat Chucky before he can regain human form by possessing one of the cadets.Like I already said, the series has lost its spark, which is actually a moot point since the creativity that made the first two films was running on used petrol fumes. Child's Play 3 has the exact same plot as its predecessors, with Andy Barclay trying once again to foil Chucky's plan to regain human form by possessing a human child (although this time around, Andy is no longer the target). While the original film offered a twisted commentary on the popularity of large life-like dolls & the second delved into the life of a foster family, this third film looks into life at a military school. Thus we have scenes where Justin Whalin arrives, only to be thrust into a harsh life, being singled out for abuse by the local sociopathic cadets. As is usual with these films, it's the Chucky show. This time, the doll kills his victims in ways that would make Freddy Krueger laugh. The first scene, where the president of the toy company is attacked by remote controlled toys, slipping on some marbles & finally strangled with a yoyo string, is quite creepy at first then turns routine (how does Chucky learn computer skills?). The other kills are milked for all the dark humour they contain – Chucky crushes one victim in a garbage truck, slits the throat of the demented hairdresser & kills the school's leader by scaring him to death, saying ""You've got to be  kidding me"" as he watches the man die of a heart attack. Plus the way Chucky sabotages the war games by switching the paintball rounds of the rifles with real bullets is positively original.The acting is decent enough for these sorts of films, with Justin Whalin playing the outsider with a troubled past quite effectively. Perrey Reeves & Dean Jacobson provide adequate support while Brad Dourif (the only actor to star in all three films) is hilarious as Chucky, once again proving to be the star of the show.",Child's Play 3
72,MovieGuy01,Not as good as Child's Play....,5,3 November 2009,"I thought that Child's Play 3 was not as good as the first film. Andy is now a teenager who has been enrolled in a military school.

In his search trying to find Andy, Chucky falls into the hands of a younger boy, and he realises that it may be easier to transfer his soul into the unsuspecting boy. Andy is the only one who knows what Chucky is up to and what he is capable of. And it's now up to him to put a stop to it before it is to late.

74,Rendanlovell,Needs more chucky,3,17 July 2020,"The oddest thing about these movies is that they are done by virtually the same people that did the original. Yet, none of the sequels (so far) are even close to being good. The same writer is always writing and chucky is always Brad Dourif. Directors come and go which explains the varying levels of visual quality but how are these sequels so uninspired? There are parts of this I like more then Childs Play 2 but there's honestly not a lot to like here either. I like the fresh new setting being a military academy. Its visually way more nice then the awful, barren house set from 2. I think the director on this was more interested in doing a good job then on 2 as well. There are some clever set ups that are satisfying when paid off and I'll never dislike Chucky as a character. He's pure evil and says the most heinous things, but man is it funny. Aside from that, this one is plagued by the same issues the 2nd one has. Which makes sense considering it's the same writer but, man, can we get a different story please? Having Chucky go after a kid not named Andy is slightly different but it all boils down to the same exact thing we've already seen twice before. Chucky kills guy, guy who witnesses it isnt believed, rinse and repeat. It's so boring at this point. Plus, there's a surprising lack of Chucky this time around. The characters overall are given a bit more to do then in 2 but they will never be as compelling as Chucky. Who doesn't do much until the final 30 minutes. He kills the ceo of the Good Guy toy company (in a scene that is never mentioned again and goes on for 10 minutes. Feels like a reshoot to cram in more chucky since he ain't there much) he traps a guy in a trash compactor, cuts a guys throat, watches a dude have a heart attack, and takes paint rounds out of guns to replace with live rounds. Compare that to the original or even the 2nd one and Chucky just doesn't do a lot. There's also a bizarre love interest introduced for Andy that is not developed naturally at all and leads to basically nothing. Of these first 3 movies I think the 2nd is the weakest overall but this is my least favorite.",Child's Play 3
75,kylehaines96,Don't (Beep) With The Chuck!(*** Out Of ****).,8,12 December 2012,"Released just 9 months after it's predecessor, Child's Play 3 opened to very abysmal reviews. Understandable because this is definitely the weakest one in the series, but it is one of those movies that I like but everyone else hates. Does this movie have flaws? Yes, but that doesn't mean that you still can't enjoy it.The film starts as Chucky voiced by Brad Dourif is rebuilt again(which you think they would've learned after the first two movies) 8 years after the events of Child's Play 2. He is raging mad and wants to find where Andy is. It turns out Andy now played by Justin Whalin has been sent to a military camp to straighten him out after his killer doll story. One night Chucky comes across a young boy named Tyler played by Jeremy Sylvers and Chucky decides that instead of chasing after Andy again, he can transfer his soul into Tyler who is friends with Andy.The problems with the film. The first being the doll effects which I consider to be the weakest of the franchise and thankfully they were vastly improved in 1998's Bride Of Chucky. The second being the acting which feels very stale with Whalin. He doesn't have the charm that Alex Vincent had in the first two movies. The third and final one being the tone of the film. This film is very dark compared to the first two. Now the second film went about 10% darker than the first but knew it's limits. Here they go full force especially the last 15 minutes which take place in a carnival. This film was the sort of start of making the films more of a horror comedy.The good of the movie. The first being the voice acting of Brad Dourif which I have praised before and I am going to praise again. he is just that good however he is best in Child's Play and Bride Of Chucky. He is the perfect one for the role and should be nominated for an award for his voice work which I am surprised has not happened... yet.The next are two things. The first is that the doll effects sometimes can manage to be creepy and scary when a scene calls for it. Next we have the army setting which I find very clever that Chucky is running around an army camp and I really do like that his main focus is not his main priority which is good at least for me because if Andy was portrayed by Alex Vincent again I would be saying the exact opposite.Lastly we have the climax which is, like the last film is the best part of the film. The climax takes place inside of a carnival, specifically in a haunted house ride which actually takes apart of Chucky's skin and has a very bloody look on his face. Effective, yes. Realistic, no.The Final Verdict for the film Child's Play 3 is 3 Stars Out Of 4. The film has good effects, great voice work and a cool climax but is held back by stale acting by Whalin, and too much of a dark tone. I suggest watching it because you can have some fun with it.Rated R For Horror Violence And Language.1hr 30min/90min.17 uses of the F-word.Cost: $13,000,000.Box Office: $20,560,255.IMDb Rating: 4.6/10.Rotten Tomatoes Rating: 23% Rotten.My Rating: ***/****",Child's Play 3

78,ReelCheese,Black Sheep? Not Quite,6,22 July 2006,"Every horror series has a black sheep. ""Friday the 13th"" had the Jason-less fifth installment, ""Halloween"" the Michael Meyers-less third entry, and ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" the silly first sequel. For many fans, ""Child's Play 3"" is the embarrassment of the Chucky saga. But why?So many reviews of this film express exacerbation, even confusion, over the sudden shift eight years into the future. What's so hard to understand? We had already had two movies with Chucky chasing a little kid. It was time to move the story along, hence our hero Andy Barclay (Justin Whalin) is now a teenager at a military academy. This change of scenery was the breath of fresh air the series needed, as it opens up all kinds of new options to the murderous doll, which he fully exploits (paintball guns loaded with real ammo, anyone?).Other reviewers complain this just isn't scary. There they have a point, but how many gorefests actually bring our hands up to our eyes? Scariness is a great complement, but that doesn't mean the whole project goes down the tubes without it. ""Child's Play 3"" has a smooth storyline, a touch of suspense and a truly memorable, original climax at a carnival (though it doesn't quite surpass the doll factory finale of the the previous film). Chucky's foul mouth begins to be a liability rather than an asset, but we can cut him some slack -- he's certainly never looked better (or more realistic).""Child's Play 3"" does have its ups and downs, however. The romance between Andy and a fellow cadet is a distraction, and there are times when our plastic star just seems brushed aside in favor of more serious moments. Chucky's desire to swap souls with someone other than Andy is a welcome change, but his new target, young Tyler, is one dimensional and uninteresting. He's unable to carry his scenes like Alex Vincent, who played child Andy in the first two films.As far as I'm concerned, this was the last of the true ""Child's Play"" films. Once this one was done, the series became a shameful, hokey parody of itself. This entry is by no means perfect and it's certainly not up the caliber of ""Child's Play 2"". Yet it's not the piece of trash so many would have us believe. In fact, it may just be one of the most underrated theatrical horror films of the early '90s.",Child's Play 3
79,zac-04879,Chucky Seems to be Left to The Side of The Storyline,6,25 October 2021,"It may not be a necessary instalment to the satisfactory series, but Child's Play 3 fascinatingly deals with the pressure under the military academy. Fans will very likely feel dissatisfied with that element, understandably because it's the entire setting and feature. Chucky runs around the place, bloodily murdering people as he searches for the child-now-teenager who defeated him.It's alike the previous films when it comes to the victims vs. Chucky, but the military school makes it very, very different, surprisingly in an interesting way. It generally keeps you distracted, especially when Chucky approaches the scenes. Releasing 3 years after the original film, the work around creating memorable Child's Play moments is better designed, too.Fans will absolutely hate the lack of the original's charm; Andy as an unsure child increased the intelligence. The performances in the previous instalments also weren't really great, but they're worse in Child's Play 3. You'll receive a tiny amount of the ability to reserve some of your care for the lead character, but there's nothing about this Chucky film that overtakes the plot.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",Child's Play 3

The whole story was stupid, one scene of realism, and all bad.  I wouldn't recommend this movie if I was paid to.  The deaths took to long and they were stupid.  Now why would an army man want to cut a doll's hair? Why would a carnival be right next to a military school with grenades and guns?

81,happyendingrocks,"Is it just me, or does Tyler seem to have some sort of bizarre amorous fixation on Chucky?",4,13 June 2012,"This third chapter of the chronicles of Chucky is so disjointed and nonsensical that it seems apparent the filmmakers couldn't decide between three rough concepts of what Child's Play 3 should be about, so they simply cobbled all of them together into this patchwork entry.Idea number one continues the plot thread centered around the Play Pal Toy Company's refusal to discontinue their Good Guy dolls explored in Child's Play 2, and when production resumes, blood from Chucky's remains is inadvertently mixed into a vat of plastic utilized to make the toys, allowing him to be reincarnated in an all new body. While the boiling cauldron of plastic appears to be massive enough to supply the skin for hundreds of Good Guys, and Chucky's vital fluid taints the entire batch, somehow this only results in a single doll being occupied by his soul, which seems like a real missed opportunity. An army of Chuckys would have been a bit silly, sure, but that result would definitely have a lot more potential than the dreck we end up sifting through here.Actually, the prologue has some promise, and the prolonged stalking murder of a Play Pal executive recalls Chucky's suspenseful buildups and playful sadism from the first film. As the introduction rolls on, we get the sense that we're in store for a darker and more purely horror-based film than Child's Play 2, which is a refreshing notion. Unfortunately, this impression is negated when the affair proceeds to phase two.The second concept is by far the dumbest of the lot, and sadly takes up the bulk of the film. The Andy character from the first two installments is reintroduced, but now he's a teenager enrolled in a military academy. Chucky locates him and is able to continue pursuing his nemesis at Andy's new stomping grounds by mailing himself to the military installation (have fun trying to figure out how Chucky is able to wrap the Good Guy box in brown paper, tape it up, get himself to a post office, and pay for the shipping... all while he's physically sealed inside the package). The parcel is intercepted by an annoying kid named Tyler (who is juvenile enough to initially believe there isn't anything strange about a doll that talks to him and moves around on its own, but is also somehow considered mature enough to participate in military training exercises), and when our impish killer realizes that he has a new candidate for his ever-elusive body transfer, Tyler becomes Chucky's target for a game of ""hide the soul."" The locale makes way for the film to pack in a score of boot camp movie clichés, including a verbally abusive commander, hazing of the hapless cadet who can't get his act together, and, most brazenly, a reprise of the ""this is my rifle, this is my gun..."" mantra from Full Metal Jacket. Despite this being a military installation, Chucky is somehow able to wander around at will undetected (guard duty apparently isn't part of the rigorous program), and at one point he even sneaks into the armory before a combat training exercise and switches out an entire squad's paint-ball rounds with live ammunition, a gag that goes unnoticed by these astute soldiers-to-be until after they've already fired off dozens of shots and killed one of their commanding officers.Things get dumber and dumber as the plot moves forward, and Chucky eventually wraps an ammo belt around his torso like Rambo for no apparent reason and secures a convenient doll-sized pistol to engage in a gun battle with our protagonists. Chucky also orchestrates a hostage situation, which concludes with him throwing a readily available hand grenade at the responding soldiers (because hand grenades are apparently routinely issued to cadets when they go out into the forest to shoot paint-balls at each other).The climax marks the third section of the film, in which Chucky absconds with Tyler and lures his pursuers to a carnival. This segment is by far the most effective, largely because the final showdown takes place inside an elaborate horror-themed roller coaster ride, which is way cooler than anything else in the movie. Andy and Chucky do battle with Tyler's potentially possessed body hanging in the balance, and while Chucky's eventual demise is gruesome and satisfying, the Tyler character is so off-puttingly idiotic that we end up rooting for him to die instead.Though this entry boasts quite a bit more gore than the previous outing, the extra red sauce isn't enough to transcend the limitations of the brain-dead story and largely rote kill scenes. The Chucky effects are predictably solid, and he has a few good one-liners, but the Freddy Krueger-esque zingers that accompany each murder get old fast.The series would of course go in a much different direction after this misguided dud, which is a very savvy move because I don't think I'd be on board for any more installments if they adhered to this tired formula. Don't get me wrong, I'm always game for mindless fun, but in Child's Play 3 the ""mindless"" definitely outweighs the ""fun.""",Child's Play 3
82,illbebackreviews,Good but Disappointing,6,1 January 2012,"I've watched the first two Child's Play films, and I thought they were brilliant. The storyline of this one is great, the characters aren't that bad. In fact, the film starts of very well. The first fifteen minutes suggest to us that this is no film made simply for more money.*SPOILERS***SPOILERS* The film starts with Chucky being re-made and then the Play Pals company decides to reopen its business after the dying out publicity. Chucky's into the action and things are interesting.Though, I prefer the young Andy, this teenage version wasn't that bad. Him at military school is all understandable. It seems quite interesting, the storyline hugely differing from the previous two.I believed that things would quickly get into action, and I was right. Chucky cleverly disposes of several people and gets young Tyler into a game of 'Hide the Soul', which is really him transferring souls with Tyler.This movie was quite funny, but really nothing that scary. From the way that the first forty five minutes started out, I expected a real big final sequence, and I was wrong. Things all seem to go so normally, then suddenly people are in danger and the final sequence suddenly appears. In the first two films, there was a big build up in the final 40 mins. There wasn't much action in the final sequence, and things got quite disappointing.***END OF SPOILERS*** The acting wasn't that bad and the storyline was good.

83,ryan-10075,"""Nothin' like a good strangulation to get the circulation goin'.""",4,19 May 2020,"I remember when this film came out I went to see it with my dad. I just never really liked it and after re-watching it again to review my feelings have not swayed. In the toy factory where Chucky was killed for the second time they are cleaning up and Chucky's blood gets dripped into a vat that gets mixed up to create new Good Guy dolls once the factory is back up and running. It is years later and Andy Barclay is now at Kent Military Academy and played by Justin Whalin. He does okay in the role, not that he is anywhere close to horrible, but he is passable in the role. But, you guessed it Chucky is after Andy in a new setting. The setting does add a bit of freshness to it, but the story written by Don Mancini itself is quite stale by now and old. It is just Chucky trying to get out of his body, which happened in the first 2 movies. I mean, yes that is exactly what the character would want to do, but there needed to be a new element added to the story and this was a missed opportunity for that. The military academy is new and the ending at an amusement park is a great setting, but it is just the matter of burning like 70 minutes to get there. Not to mention the greatest line in this movie is stolen from Stanley Kubrick's FULL METAL JACKET.What does work though is Chucky. The doll by Kevin Yaegher is cool and Chucky does have a couple of pretty good lines and he is still voiced by Brad Dourif with all the right attitude. But, now Chucky is trying to get into the body of a 10 year old kid named Ronald Tyler (Jeremy Sylvers), who to me is kind of annoying and really quite stupid. At that age I think it would rock their world if a doll started to move around and could have a conversation with it. He just takes it as completely normal. Also the characters decisions in this movie are questionable. For example why does Chucky let Andy know of his entire plan to get inside the body of Tyler? Wouldn't it be much better to do it all under the cover of darkness? Doesn't make any sense to me and doesn't add enough tension as it isn't anything new to the series. In the end the characters just aren't as interesting as they were in the previous two installments. Andy Robinson also stars and plays a pretty creepy barber Sgt. Botnick.If you completely loved the first 2 CHILD'S PLAY films give it a go as some people really do enjoy this one, but to me it was a major step down.",Child's Play 3
84,Toronto85,Child's Play 3,5,25 February 2011,"Child's Play 3 apparently takes place eight years after the events that occurred in the toy factory of part two.

Bad mistake, as it is soon discovered, Chucky is resurrected again and continues his hunt for Andy. It's then that Chucky decides to take the body of a different little boy Tyler (Jeremy Sylvers). The movie takes place in a military school in which Andy has been enrolled. After many kills, Chucky chases Andy, his ""girlfriend"" and the other little boy to the local carnival. The fun ensues in a giant and very cool looking funhouse.The best part of the whole movie is the finale in the funhouse/horror house. The rest of the movie is kind of a drag. The acting is mediocre and the supposed scares aren't very scary. The kid Tyler is especially annoying as we watch him befriend the talking doll. Justin Whalin was OK, but Alex Vincent is Andy Barclay. The rest of the military school leaders annoyed me to no end as well.This one didn't capture the action/excitement of the first two. Even director Don Mancini has called it his least favourite because he felt he was out of ideas so soon after Part 2. Child's Play 3 is the weakest of the Chucky films up to this point, but wait!

85,Hancock_the_Superb,"Horrible, corny, stupid . . . but nothin' wrong with Chucky! **minor spoilers ahead**",3,11 July 2002,"I'll admit I haven't seen the first two ""Child's Play"" films (or ""Bride of Chucky"", for that matter), though I kinda wanted to since I heard Chucky was a cool guy.  One day I found my brother watching this on Sci-Fi and I decided, what the heck, there's nothing better to do, and watch this.
**Warning: Some spoilers concerning deaths and some (relatively minor) plot points.**Well, there's a whole cr@p loada bad parts.  Obviously, in the third film about a murderous doll, you don't expect much in the way of plot. But, GOD, the scares are cheaper than my younger brother.  As other reviewers have said, it's kinda hard to be scared of Chucky, given his height.  All of the murders (except, perhaps, the one in the garbage truck, though that was stupid and pointless) were telegraphed a half hour in advance.  None of the humans really develop any personalities, though I enjoy Andrew Robinson (Scorpio in ""Dirty Harry"") as the insane barber who dies trying to give the Chuckster a trim.Also, this film was made in 1991, but took place eight years after CP2? (made in 1990)  Please!The main attraction, of course, is Chucky himself.  Again voiced by Brad Douriff (whatever happened to him?  He used to be a great, respectable actor [see ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest""]), but now, he's pretty much confined to crappy sci-fi.  Still, he gives it his all (why is my question), and Chucky does a decent job of making the film watchable.  The scene where Col. Cochrane (Dakin Matthews) dies of a heart attack while Chucky attacks him, and most of Chucky's dialogue, are a real scream.  Unfortunately, Chucky DOES come across as a bit stupid, but he's still very cool, despite his plasticness.Overall, however, this film sucks.Three out of ten.",Child's Play 3
86,kingofdanerds,The black sheep of the genre,5,17 September 2021,"Ever wondered what Full Metal Jacket would be like if it was only the first half of the film and in that there is a killer doll named Chucky? Well, for those wondering what it would be like, we have Child's Play 3. Now, Child's Play 3 was being written way before Child's Play 2 was even released and nine months after Child's Play 2, Child's Play 3 was released in 1991. Directed by Jack Bender and stars Justin Whalin, Perrey Reeves, and Jeremy Sylvers. The film was made on a budget of about $13 million and made about $20 million worldwide. The film received negative reception from both critics and audiences alike and is still to this day a polarizing sequel amongst horror fans alike.Eight years after the events of Child's Play 2, Chucky miraculously is brought back to life and manages to track down a now 16 year Andy (Justin Whalin) to a military school. While there, Chucky plans on transferring his soul yet again, but this time into the body of a younger kid (Jeremy Silvers).I cannot admit that Child's Play 3 is the worst horror sequel I have ever seen. I have actually grown to have a sort of guilty pleasure with this film (along the likes of Jaws 3D, Friday the 13th Part V and such). Yes, this film is a complete repeat of the previous two films. Chucky is a killer doll, and now he needs to find someone to put his soul into. This film is not all around scary either though I will admit the first ten minutes are actually pretty good. Right in these first ten minutes you can clearly point out the positives that this film has. I personally like the film's soundtrack which has a more impactful sound and it is really the only soundtrack out of the Child's Play series that I can really remember. The film opens up with a pretty good kill. All around, I like the kills in this film. If anything, I would say that all of the kills are at least better than those seen in the original Child's Play but it is a bit of a toss up when comparing to the kills seen in Child's Play 2. In here, we get a few creative kills, but not nearly as gory as to be seen in the later films. But once we get to the military academy, things go a bit downhill from there. This is what makes the film so polarizing for some. Sure, I think a new setting is nice, but nobody really asked for a film (let alone a Child's Play film) to be set at a military academy. It is extremely cliche all around. The typical characters you would expect to see in a film set at a military academy are all there. It is described in the trailer as ""hell on earth"" and it sure is. It is portrayed fine as a place that you would never want to be at and you kind of feel for Andy as he is harassed and abused. But I still stand by my earlier statement. The film just overall feels like (and actually quotes from) Full Metal Jacket. It just makes the whole film almost feel like two films. One film being anything with Chucky, and the other were Andy gets beaten and bullied. The actors do an alright job all around with what they are given. The characters are somewhat memorable. We have Andy and his ""love interest"", De Silva. We also got the nerdy Whitehurst and the jerk, Shelton. Then there is the annoying eight year old Tyler. Tyler is extremely annoying and at times, I really root for Chucky when it comes to the scenes with both Chucky and Tyler. So annoying. Brad Dourif returns once again as the voice of Chucky and while, overall, I prefer the voice acting and performance in the second film much more, Brad Dourif does fine and gets a few memorable one liners and some are some good all-timers. I will complain about the way that they bring Chucky back. It is not creative and just opens up more plot holes. The last act of the film is fine and does just enough to be memorable, but, I do not want to spoil anything.Child's Play 3 is a step down from previous entries in the franchise. It is a repeat of what is already seen but if you are into that, then this film should be no problem to you.",Child's Play 3
87,smellthecult-com-1,He's a killer....do-oll,6,28 January 2010,"It's several years after the events of number 2, and Andy Barclay is now all growed up an' tha', a cadet in an evil military school, having spent several years in psychiatric care. Whilst stable now, he is still haunted by the events of his childhood, the evil Good Guy doll Chucky never far from his mind, so imagine his horror when a newly released version of the doll turns up at the barracks and becomes the plaything of the youngest cadet on site, Tyler. Can Andy convince the others that the doll is more than it seems? And will Chucky be able to get his soul into a human host before being dismembered once again? Whilst it is true that this is a little bit by the numbers, it is nevertheless an enjoyable enough affair, the star turn of course being the always excellent Brad Dourif's voicing of Chucky, giving the animated puppet a real air of menace.Whilst by movie number 3 most horror franchises start to play things for laughs, this one is played admirably straight, aside from the occasional one liner from Chucky after a killing. Also of note is a fine, if minimal, performance from Andrew 'Hellraiser' Robinson as a sadistic barber. Whilst not a classic, fans of the first two should be happy enough.",Child's Play 3
88,FKDZ,"Some fun parts, but mostly mediocre.",4,25 September 2020,"Child's Play 3 so far has been the movie that just didn't measure up to the first, nor the second. What it lacked the most was good acting, writing, kills and chucky scenes. What let me down the most personally was the lack of good chucky scenes. Compared to the second movie this movie really adds nothing new to his persona. They reuse the middle finger trope but it doesn't really work without Kyle doing it back, so its kinda just there. He still has some good lines here and there but not much. Also there are some annoying plot holes like the dead barber not being reported and how chucky got in the boxI also felt that the puppeteering in this one was a bit all over the place, sometimes it was fantastic (mainly close ups of the face), but a lot of the body/moving around shots were sloppy.Another negative is the focus on older Andy and the whole army plot, it was fine as a setting and the few scenarios they used were good in concept. Just the execution that was a bit lackluster. The older Andy, the actor was meh, and the entire cast was meh all around, but the worst offender being Tyler. Now the young andy actor in the first two wasn't the best either, but the Tyler character has multiple moments where I was just out of it, just a huge lack of range in his performance.This movie did not engross me as much as the previous two. I really found myself getting distracted and a bit bored towards the end when that's supposed to be the exciting part. The final set piece looked great, and it was used all right but it doesn't live up the the factory scenes in the previous movie.What started to bother me as well, and it was already slightly present in the second one but it still had some tense moments....is that in this movie there is like zero suspense or attempts to make chucky scary. I never thought chucky was actually scary from the start, but the directors in previous movies definitely knew how to add more suspense. In this movie you pretty much always know where chucky is.The kills are kinda there, not very involved. Out of all I guess the barbershop kill is the most memorable.The movie ends with andy shooting chucky, very uninspired and then chucky falling in the fan that shreds him, whilst a cool effect. Nothing really crazy. After that the movie just ends. We get one more shot panning from the country fair and that's that, weak ending for a weak film.4/10, wouldn't really care to watch again.",Child's Play 3
89,tequila101,Presto Your Dead! The Darkest and Most Violent Chucky Film,8,17 May 2012,"I truly believe that ""Child's Play 3"" is the last REALLY great Chucky film in the series as Bride and Seed don't ultimately work for me that much. Even though the this film was released less than a year after it's predecessor, I still think it holds up well, and I disagree with the creators of the franchise that it is the least best of the Chucky films. I personally thought this was a much better take on than Bride and See because it still stood the test at being scary. Even though, there are a slight few problems with this sequel, I still like it for what it is.This film is supposedly set several years after the first two ""Child's Play"" films and focuses on Andy Barclay (now being played by Justin Whalin), going to a military school which is full of meat heads and gives the ol' grueling drills. Andy definitely does not fit in straight away. On the other side of the story, the Good Guy Doll factory after being a dead site is revived where the melted Chucky from the last film is remade by the hot melting plastic. Chucky comes back to life again, in a new body and kills off the toy maker's owner Mr. Sullivian. He then finds the location of Andy, and mails himself to the military site, where instead of going after Andy, he goes after Tyler. Andy seems to know everything while the others have no knowledge about what's going happening.I believe ""Child's Play 3"" is another excellent entry in the killer doll franchise, and it's very underrated for a killer doll film.Starting off with some positives, I like the entire concept where Andy doesn't only have to face his fears of Chucky again, but he also has to deal with the nasty military school peers who bully and give him a hard time during the process. At first, I also thought that the military site and later on the carnival rides was a bit too the extreme but now I think it is pulled off well.The music score (although varying and different in tone and style) I feel worked quite well.Justin Whalin surprinsgly does a good job as Andy, where I felt sympathy for him. He truly brought the character back to prime source. Sure, he's no Alex Vincent, but he did well with what he was given. The others actors such as Travis fine, perry Reeves and Andrew Robinson were good in their roles.Once again, the entire credit goes to Brad Dourif as the voice of Chucky, where he brings a dark sense of humor to him. He gives him a stalkerish, creepy personality where the doll is more nastier, more brutllaer and definitely mean spirited at best. The look of Chucky once again gets a plus because I like how they kept up with the times, to see what Good Guy Dolls would look like several years later. Chucky is more scary looking in this one.The kills like the 2nd film were also done at an excellent pace.There were a few problems to put out, but there aren't too many as I do like this sequel.1: The actor playing Tyler was awful. Really the worse actor in the film. He was definitely not convincing as a scared little boy and all he did was yell, be happy or just be silly. I'm not really sure how I took this, he was just horrible in this film.2: Once again, this film can not reach the impact or tension of the original. Like the film before it, it just seems to be some slasher fun which is dark and nasty. That's all.That's really the only problems I had with this film. I do think ""Child's Play 3"" is a sequel that nearly works on the same level as ""Child's Play 2"" did. I do like it.7.5/10",Child's Play 3

91,shaun98,Tired sequel **spoilers**,4,5 November 2002,"""Child's Play 3"" is yet another tired horror sequel. Produced immediately after the release of its immediate predecessor, it is well made on a technical level, but the material is wearing thin. The story gets off to a good start; many years after the previous films, the toy company plans to put the ""Chucky"" doll back into production, deciding that all the negative publicity surrounding the ""unexplained"" deaths has passed. Chucky himself is resurrected in a new (but identical) body, and after dispatching the company president, tracks down little Andy, who is now a troubled teen in a military school. So far so good, but the writers have little idea where to go after setting up the story, which descends into the usual tedious business. Even the novelty of the setting doesn't really help. The opening credits are stylish, but we need a little more than that for plot.Justin Whalin is admittedly credible in the role of the grown Andy, and offers what is probably a reasonably accurate portrait of how the character would have changed in eight to ten years. The filmmakers could have made a worse movie by giving us an stereotypical annoying teen character in the lead, but they managed to avoid that problem at least. Travis Fine's character is, however, the most hateful in the entire movie. I realize there's a jerk in every military setting, but this is one guy who deserves to be killed off early on, so that we may be spared his immature antics. Brad Dourif lends his squeaky voice to the killer doll once more, though I wonder if he was getting tired of the routine by this point. Andrew Robinson is wasted as a mean-spirited barber.After an interminable period of uninspired kills, the film climaxes at an nearby amusement park. This portion of the film is incredibly contrived. First of all, I doubt that such a place would be located anywhere a military establishment. Even if I am wrong on this, the whole thing still feels tacked on. There is no creative reason why such a setting is necessary. It is painfully clear that the writers were fumbling for ideas and simply picked something at random. Perhaps someone involved in the production was a fan of Tobe Hooper's ""Funhouse."" At the very least, ""Child's Play 3"" does not hint at the possibility of a sequel; though one was eventually produced years later, that is another review altogether.*1/2 (out of ****)Released by Universal Pictures",Child's Play 3

95,Snake-666,Slightly better than the second but still rather dull.,5,20 July 2003,"Will those greedy fat cats at Playpals never learn? Once again the Good Guy' doll gets re-released and once again one doll contains the spirit of Charles Lee Ray (Chucky voiced by Brad Dourif), the notorious Lakeshore strangler. Chucky tracks down Andy (Justin Whalin) who is now grown up and in military school but after realising he has a new body Chucky decides to try and possess a young kid named Tyler (Jeremy Sylvers) rather than try and possess Andy. Andy finds out about Chucky's diabolical scheme and makes it his mission to stop him, however, as well as Chucky he is going to have to contend with a power-mad Lieutenant named Shelton (Travis Fine).A little different from the previous two instalments, albeit mainly because virtually the entire movie takes place in a Military School, Child's Play 3' is slightly better than the previous instalment but still seems a rather unnecessary sequel. This is the first of the Child's Play' films to not feature Alex Vincent in the role of Andy as the makers opted for an older Andy in this movie and Justin Whalin portrays the character rather well though one would question whether Andy would not possibly be in an institution rather than a military school, and wouldn't he have some serious mental issues? There are quite a few plot holes in the story and some very bad scripting in parts but as sequels go Child's Play 3' is about average for a third sequel to an average movie and will probably entertain the Chucky fans at least once. Don Mancini once again wrote the screen play for the movie though this time Jack Bender took the directors chair and didn't really improve on the direction from John Lafia in the second. Tom Holland's direction in the original film was probably what made Child's Play' such a viable franchise and though these future instalments gave the fans what they wanted (more screen time for Chucky, more blood, more victims) they also failed to add any interesting twists. A film centered on a killer doll is bound to be rather bland but more should have been done to make the film more entertaining, adding a new `victim' just was not enough. Like with the previous two movies there were a lot of seemingly pointless or over-suspended scenes which made the movie drag rather than be entertaining.The acting was pretty poor from most of the cast except Justin Whalin, though Travis Fine did a half-decent job of playing the loathsome Lt. Shelton and Perrey Reeves was quite likeable (in a similar way to the character of Kyle in the second) as Andy's romantic interest De Silva.If you are a fan of the previous two films then I'd recommend this for at least one viewing, it is slightly better than the second movie but still not on par with the original. Anyone who disliked the original movie should probably avoid this. My rating for Child's Play 3'  5.5/10.",Child's Play 3

97,henrymadman,Good,8,8 July 2007,"Under pressure from Universal Studios, screenwriter Don Mancini was asked to begin writing the third film even before the second film was released. Hence, Child's Play 3 was released in August 1991, less than one year after Child's Play 2 was released in October 1990. Mancini has called it his least favourite because he felt he was out of ideas so soon after part 2. The time line between this movie and the sequel Bride of Chucky takes place in the same year, yet impossible. Andy turned six in November, and he is sixteen in this movie. Bride of Chucky would need to take place at least a month or so (possibly in December) of 1998. A prologue to the film was initially written featuring a pair of siblings, Joey and Pam, who break into the abandoned Good Guy Factory. The sequence would've made for lots of creepy visuals and explain how the doll making machine ""turns on by itself"". In the script Pam finds Chucky's remains and part of his head ""snaps vigorously at her fingertips"". She falls backwards onto a lever, activating the machine. The two children scamper off. Jason Ritter (son of actor John Ritter who would later appear in Bride of Chucky) was initially cast to play the character of Joey. At the last minute Universal opted not to film the prologue.The film was filmed at historic Kemper Military School (now closed).

But on the 3rd one, it's time for Chucky to just give up and go to Hell where he ultimately belongs!!!When I saw all 3 Chucky films, I was impressionably young. This 3rd one, to a child of my age was 'cool'. I look at it now, and I think - I didn't like THIS one did I?!!Andy has grown up, and it looks as though Chucky is well and truly dead. 8 years have passed and Andy has joined the army!! ooooo.k....BUT, the company that make the Good Guy dolls re-make more dolls, using the same doll that Chucky was in!! Will they EVER learn??!! obviously not!What follows this time is a tired storyline, only given a new lease of life due to Chucky's realisation that he doesn't need Andy, he can use another kid.To me, this one killed the franchise. It should have ended HERE!! without a doubt. But noooooooooo - they made a 4th, and there's a 5th on the way!!!!Anyway, to focus on the few good points of this movie -This, as with the 2nd film, features a gorgeous female character, so you're interest is held only due to the fact that she's in it!!A few good killing's with more humour thrown in - I have to admit, when Chucky jumps out brandishing a knife and lets out one of his trademark screams, and his victim suffers a heart attack, Chucky's response?

102,Kristamw,Great,10,8 June 2019,"When I saw the first Child's Play, I was just a kid, and I absolutely HATED it. It terrified me. That was over 30 years ago. I refused to rewatch it, until a few months ago. I was surprised by how much it didn't freak me out. In fact, I was impressed with how well it was put together. So, I watched the second one a little later. And tonight, the third.
Like the first two, this sequel holds a lot of promise. It's fun, crazy, and the action progresses before you can blink. The actor playing Andy this time around seems like he could be a double for the original actor. Great casting there. And ""Chucky"" is as wacko fun as ever.
Writing Quality: An interesting setting--a military academy, where Andy presides, and where Charles Lee begins his hunt to re-enter Andy's body by using the naive Tyler to get to him. The atmosphere actually works well for the dysfunctional Chucky and his games, with a plethora of characters that add flavor to each pivoting plot point.
Scare Factor: There is one scene that made me scream. Can you guess what it is? Otherwise, Chucky isn't really scary as much as he is just plain insane.
Content (sex, language & violence): No sex or nudity. One kiss and a shot of a """"Playpen"" bikini model. A crude crotch gesture. A bunch of language, primarily from Chucky (that's his style). Lots of kill violence.
Values: Looking out for others.",Child's Play 3
103,Hellrazr360,"While Somewhat Preposterous, It's Actually An Improvement Over It's Predecessors",6,7 March 2006,"What is considered the worst of the Child's Play movies is actually an improvement for the series. Andy's now in his teens and has gone to Military School, why, we don't really know. Chucky's back and he's out to get Andy again, but then he finds a new and younger body to take possession of. While this movie has no real scares or thrills to offer it actually comes out better than the last two Child's Play movies for a few reasons. For one, as Andy is now in his teen years and has his hormones starting to show it makes for a more serious tone compared to the silliness of the eight-year-old Andy from the last. Also, the fact that the movie is at a military school also makes for a bit more seriousness. Also, Chucky is as lovable as ever, still holding up with his cruel but somewhat charming personality. However, Child's Play 3 finds problems besides little to no scares or thrills. For instance, the movie acts like a long TV show, not managing to pull off any real development in the characters or plot. The movie also seems rushed in a way, like the crew wanted to end the movie as quickly as possible but make it long enough. Yet, the movie does feel more complete and satisfying compared to its predecessors. It's just a shame that the actors are cheesy one minute but then almost serious the next. The overall delivery from this sequel is that it's better than the last two, but is still plagued by what has brought the other Child's Play movies down.",Child's Play 3

106,jpasols,A cool thrilling second sequel!!!,10,24 April 2019,"Even though I'm giving Child's Play 3 a 10 out of 10 rating this movie still has its problems! I love this second sequel of the Chucky series but some things fail with this 3rd installment. Let me begin with the negative side of this film first since the list is shorter...first problem with this film is the acting, the acting wasnt nearly as strong as the actors in the first 2 films, the only good actor in Child's Play 3 is the main character himself...Chucky, voiced once again by Brad Dourif (Chucky, Child's Play 1 and 2). Chucky, the star of this 3rd installment saves this movie just by being his crazy self. Performances by Justin Whalin (as teenage Andy Barclay) and Perrey Reeves and Jeremy Sylvers are weak, the acting in this film is almost unwatchable. Luckily Chucky himself was able to make this film fun like 1 and 2.
Now for the positive side of this film I like how they switch up the environment again as they did with Child's Play 2, the original being set in the city, the 2nd being set in the suburbs, and the 3rd set in the miliatary academy. It keeps the Child's Play trilogy fresh and entertaining and keeps the audiences engaged with new things the sequels have to offer. New death scenes that are more creative too! Child's Play 2 definitely had some cool death scenes such as the teacher whacked by a yard stick scene and Child's Play 3 having the garbage truck death scene which was my favorite death scene from Chucky 3. As the second film did, Childs Play 3 connects dots with the original two films, talking about Andy's past and his mother. The opening intro for Childs Play 3 alone was spectacular and amazing!! The soundtrack was spot on and sounded cool and eerie, I like how they made the soundtrack blend in with a military style sound with the snare drums an all. If you're a huge Chucky or cheesy horror fan you gotta check out Childs Play 3. Not as bad of a sequel as everyone makes it out to be. It has its flaws but it doesn't kill the film completely. A worthy third entry in the thrilling Chucky franchise. Give it a go folks! 10 out of 10 for me with flaws.",Child's Play 3

The story concept that Andy was at a military school(at age 16) and that no one believed in his stories that chucky was alive and tried to kill/possess him. But there were lots of scenes that I liked in the film like when chucky and Andy talked in the bedroom, the battle with live ammo , the chucky face cut scene, all the death scenes, and the stalking of the young child named Tyler. The scene when the to sides of the military students shooting each other with real weapons(instead of paint balls) was really scary because neither side had not known of the switch of the guns and that was awful because a lot of people had died because of it. I do suggest that if anyone in the military that had seen this film, to beware of all big dolls on your base/camp area. My whole family had seen this film and was terrified and amazed at how one doll could create such chaos and madness at an academy filled with lots of weapons of all sorts. I do suggest that anyone under the age of 12 yrs. of age to not watch this film unless you are with some one responsible for watching you reactions.

It limits the viciousness enough to still have fun, and I think this works very well. The writing and set design work great together. The slightly quirky look and feel of the characters really makes them feel realistic, more so than in many horror flicks from the time. And the acting is decent too. The script is clever enough. It supplies some good one-liners, decent dialog, and scary, tense set pieces. The military setting is also very gritty and fun. The effects are decent too. Chucky still talks realistically, and moves his arms and legs well. There are drawbacks though, like the issue I've seen in many of these films, where Chucky is standing there without moving his legs at all and people are running from him, but he doesn't seem to be a threat at all. But this only happens once. Other than that, he still moves pretty well, and the gore FX are excellent. So I thought Child's Play 3 was a very good horror film, an improvement from the second installment.",Child's Play 3

Justin Whalin Is Good As Andy But Not As Good As Alex Vincent. Brad Dourif Is Awesome As Chucky Again. The Kills Were Amazing. Tyler Is Kinda Cool. ""Presto Ya Dead!"" Was Really Funny.

113,dperky,Chucky Joins The Military,6,29 July 2019,"The Child's Play series is known for a having a pretty solid run. Even the lesser installments have something worthwhile to recommend, but Child's Play 3 feels the least inspired and the most rushed (probably because it was).After pieces of him fell into the plastic vat at the end of the last film, Chucky is reborn as a fresh, new doll and he decides to go after Andy who is now at a military boarding school. Perhaps sensing that Andy is now too old, Chucky sets his sights on a younger boy at the school who can still be charming by Chucky's doll facade.It's hard to tell how much time has passed in between films. It seems like Chucky was reborn fairly quickly, but the action of the film takes place after Andy is a good deal older than he was in Child's Play 2. Isn't there some sort of clause where Chucky only has so much time he can spend in a doll or new body before he's trapped there forever? Hm....",Child's Play 3

The way chucky comes back this time is a weird one, his blood gets mixed with the premix plastic of the dolls and presto he becomes a new doll. This time it's a bit different as chucky has a new target to transfer his soul into and he doesn't want andy messing it up.Unfortunately andy is recast in this one only being 1 year later alex Vincent would have been too young for the role. Chuckys one liners are great in this but the movie isn't as good as the previous one.The kills are weak, one of them having a heart attack just from seeing chucky alive no joke. The best parts come in the last 10 mins when chucky starts getting torn to pieces. Still a good movie but could have been better.",Child's Play 3

It's a nice idea to send Andy to a Military Camp where he is tracked down by the murderous doll. It's sad though that the consumerism topic is just a little story detail at the beginning and then we never hear of it again. Meanwhile Chucky now hunts a friend of Andy, a much younger black kid so that Chucky actually can say ""I'm becoming a Bro!"" (oh my!). Looking back on this film I can't think of Justin Whalin as Andy. For me he's Jimmy Olsen from The Adventures of Lois & Clark OR - my guilty movie pleasure - the main guy in Dungeons & Dragons. Take that, Chucky!",Child's Play 3

117,dullfinboy,Great movie,10,3 August 2012,"This movie is not the best in the series but I did like it a lot. Brad Dourif does again voice the crazy murderous doll Chucky. Sadly Alex Vincent does not play Andy Barclay in this movie. Chucky is again after Andy. He first kills the toy company person by hitting him in the head with a golf club, throwing a dart in his spine, throwing a dart at his hand, and strangling him to death with a yo-yo. he finds and at a military school. He then decides to go after Tyler. He still causes trouble for Andy though. The movie is more comedic that the other two. This still can be scary. The animatronics are the best in this one. Chucky is also causing mischief. This is a very gory movie. The acting is the weakest in this one. The movie is entertaining and fun to watch. 10/10. Not the greatest of the movies it is great though.",Child's Play 3

The plot is just tedious and acting worse than that in the king of all bad films Jason Goes To Hell: The Final Friday.Excusing the fact that it would be impossible for Chucky to climb into the doll box wrapping it with him inside and then mailing it to Andy, they could have made this film fun but they didn't.

119,kitfox30,A word to all you haters of this movie,7,31 December 2016,"Okay, so placing it eight years in the future and dumping Alex Vincent for attractive Justin Whalin may have turned people off. I kinda wondered how Chucky managed to wrap and address the package when he was in the box, but whatever. This is my favourite of the series and also the best comic moments until Bride of Chucky came along. I did hear that Alex had no desire to appear in this movie which is probably why it was set up the way it was. It is an interesting take on the series, but if anyone else noticed the blood dripping into a vat of boiling plastic, wouldn't there be more dolls affected?? My rating is 1) Child's Play 3 2) Bride of Chucky 3) Child's Play 4) Child's Play 2 5) Seed of Chucky. BTW Curse of Chucky is not worth watching.",Child's Play 3
120,ajohns1,Best of the Series,8,24 October 2002,"I like this movie as much as part 2 more than part 1 and definately much more than part 4. This movie is very good although they could have wated a little longer then a year so that they could make this better. Justin whalin is great for the part he's very convincing for being a scared little trouble maker. But the only thing I really didn't like was that annoying little kid who would never stop wining about the stupid good guy dolls. I really liked the music and the opening scene with him and the greedy good guy owner.If you feel like watching a horror trilogy watch child's Play 1,2 and 3 forget about Bride of Chucky. 9/10",Child's Play 3
121,Was-it-All-a-Dream,Child's Play 3 (1991),3,5 May 2009,"There are train wrecks. Sad things; they usually take place down here. And then, there are train wrecks that take place in the sky. Because the transportation conductor running the show is higher than a kite, has absolutely no idea what they're doing, and won't be bothered to look on the road ahead to ensure an accident does not lie up ahead. I thought Child's Play 2 was a train wreck, the sort that would fit this description. I was wrong. I thought that was as low as this series could go and the next film just had to be better somehow. I was mistaken there as well. I am passionately anti-drug, but I want to know what writer Don Mancini was smoking when he wrote these early sequels. Did someone lace his cigars with angeldust? And this isn't because they're in any way Fantasia-like, or anything like that. It's because of how unbelievably insane the ideas are.First, Andy was never a complex character. You felt bad for the child actor playing him in the first two movies, he was very sympathetic. But there was nothing really going on inside him. He was not an important part of the franchise. I could watch a hundred movies (if I were forced to) with Chucky just running around, stabbing people and swearing at them, and never once go- where's Andy? So, the kid grows up or his parents don't want him in anymore of the movies. I can live with that. I can even accept that Mancini decided to write him as a teenager, since he wrote him into a role that I'm naturally attracted to watching- the introverted, misunderstood, slightly strange, put-upon loner. But that's where this movie's greatest flaws lie.Let's just start with how whiny and irritating the sniveling, prepubescent Justin Whalin is. At least when John Waters cast him in Serial Mom, he was supposed to be irritating. Here, it's like they think it's an added perk. The character is already such a miserably lame goody-two-shoes, who - even though he's supposed to be mentally fragile and disturbed - leaps at every chance to stop the evil Chucky from killing, even though everyone Chucky targets are oppressing him in some way. If he were really disturbed, wouldn't there be some part of him that was happy people were being murdered? He's basically the Carrie or the Angela Baker (Sleepaway Camp) of this movie, being tormented by stern, judgmental sergeants and sadistic lieutenant cadets drilling and taunting him. Several cadets lashing out at him or threatening him. This situation was just begging for a playfully evil bite of sweet revenge.But, no... That would have been too experimental or risky. Instead of being mean spirited toward the tormentors, Universal horror movies of this era were all about being mean spirited toward the victims (especially Wes Craven's films for the studio). Then at the last minute, the sadistic jerks who drove you crazy get knocked down by a bullet or they bump their head on the ceiling (1989's Shocker), and that's it. That's all they get as a penalty for the evil they perpetrated and the pain they caused to the protagonists (say that 5 times fast). We get no satisfaction of revenge. No reparations. Nada. In fact, if anything the worst characters in the movie get the quickest, least painful deaths. What kind of justice is that? What ever happened to- what goes around comes around?Or, if Andy can't be morally vague- what about his twin brother, Whitehurst? He's so physically low head-hung, moping around, defeated in every way. It'd be no stretch at all to show him laughing evilly or smiling a little at the sight of the ensuing carnage. As it stands, he's the only truly interesting character in the movie (played to perfection by the quintessentially nerdy Dean Jacobson). Another bright spot, though not nearly as bright, is the vivacious and energetic Perrey Reeves as the sassy DaSilva. The only cadet to be able to knock king-jerk of the jerk-pile Brett C. Shelton (played by the gorgeous, ultra-masculine Travis Fine, who you may remember as the orderly who loses his job because of Winona Ryder in Girl, Interrupted) off his pedestal. And because I don't like to leave anyone out, she has a friend who is also enjoyable to watch, played by Donna Eskra.With a movie this embarrassing, it's best not to dwell too much more on the negatives. So, as a final positive, I'll say that the movie does have a cool ending. Not a great one, but a cool one. You can thank Universal Studios directly for that. There's no doubt that the idea surely had something tied-in with Universal's world-famous amusement parks. This setting actually became amazingly popular for horror films and thrillers in the 1990's (Dr. Giggles, Fear, True Crime- the one with Alicia Silverstone). Here, it's a ""house of horrors"" type roller-coaster ride that takes the car passengers up a mountain. Or something. You will marvel at it, surrender now. It's truly awesome-looking. As is the famous Chucky doll when the Grim Reaper's scythe slices half his face off. You just gotta love those Kevin Yagher special effects, they look incredible.",Child's Play 3
122,Crazyfarts,Not very good but still pleases Chucky fans such as myself.,7,29 December 2002,"It's been eight years since the events in the second film, we now see that Andy is a teenager who has been enrolled in a military school. Play Pals Toy Company decides to re-release its Good Guys line, feeling that after all this time, the bad publicity has died down. As they re-used old materials, the spirit of Charles Lee Ray once again comes to life. In his search for Andy, Chucky falls into the hands of a younger boy, and he realizes that it may be easier to transfer his soul into this unsuspecting child. Andy is the only one who knows what Chucky is up to, and it's now up to him to put a stop to it.When I was a wee lil' boy back in the early 90's, I managed to hold out on seeing this movie till I had seen number 2 since the video store screwed up and still had Child's Play 2 as an overnight and had Child's Play 3 as a weekly rental (I refused to pay those expensive prices to have a movie for just 1 day).I felt that this movie was good FOR a Chucky film but if this movie was an original and the other 2 hadn't existed, this would probably have left me feeling somewhat disappointed. It was a standard sequel that had no great story to it, basically has a known horror character doing what he does best...kill, kill, kill! Chucky at a military school? Sounds kind of silly, doesn't it? At least it's not as dull as the plots to Halloween and Friday the 13th sequels.There were some nice moments in the film though, once again with Chucky making smart-ass comments after/before he disposes of his victims. I think the casting could have been much better. From what I can tell, Alex Vincent who played Andy Barclay and Child's Play 1 and 2 has different coloured eyes to Justin Whalin who plays Andy Barclay in Child's Play 3. It's not exactly something you'd notice though unless you were a hardcore fan to the bone.There are some moments that have an opportunity to make you jump, it all depends on how much attention you are paying to the movie though. If you get bored quickly from the movie you probably won't be able to give all of your attention to the film but there is quite a lot of Chucky ""action"" at the beginning that gets you straight into the entertaining parts.Overall, Child's Play 3 is quite watchable but you'd wanna keep to Child's Play 1 and 2 because they are much better. Still, I'm a Chucky fan so my score is somewhat biased but anyone who's a Chucky fan or even a slasher fan may find some merit in this movie.",Child's Play 3

126,geno-young,"Excellent! Possibly the best out of the series, don't listen to the haters...",10,5 October 2017,"I love everything about this movie. The acting is compelling and I love the darker tone of the film. Chucky doesn't play around (no pun intended) on this one, he is focused on his target and kills anyone who stands in his way. You must admit that the death sequences are both creative and original. I also like how they incorporated the psychological side of horror, Andy was now all grown up but he was still battling his demons before Chucky even showed up. It works really well how they made Chucky torture Andy, he could have easily killed him early on but he forces Andy to suffer by watching him kill everyone and attempt to possess a new child. He's really brutal in this one! As usual, Brad Dourif is fabulous and delivers some of Chucky's most iconic lines, which adds a little humor and gives way to the next two installments. All in all, a classic horror flick that easily surpassed its two predecessors. I haven't seen Cult of Chucky yet, but as of right now this is my favorite installment, and definitely a stronger edition in the series.",Child's Play 3

A weak script that skips the scares and excitement makes this is worst sequel in this solid franchise. Chucky loses his edge and becomes boring. The setting of the film does not work with the premise of Chucky well and worst of all, the movie becomes redundant. I never thought I would hate a 'Child's Play"" movie as much as I do this one, but I guess it came out just a little too soon after the second sequel. ""Child's Play""-7/10, ""Child's Play 2""-8/10 and there we have 'Child's Play 3""-2/10!

This movie is sometimes heralded as the Bastard Child of the series. We are now following a teenage Andy Barclay (now played by Justin Whalen) as he is entering Military School. Meanwhile, and with zero points for originality, play Pals toys is hellbent on once again reviving the Good Guys toy line. So once again via this method, Chucky is back. Chucky finds out where Andy is and he's off to the races to put his soul in Andy's body. Somewhere along the line the rules change. No longer must Chucky put his soul in the body of the first person he comes into contact with. Apparently, this idea was abandoned. He meets a young black child at the military academy named Tyler (Jeremy Sylvers). And now Chucky wants to put his soul in Tyler But it is up to Andy to stop him.So we have Chucky knocking people off and spitting out one liners left and right. The most memorable being during one of his attempts to put his soul in Tyler's body. ""Looks like Chucky's gonna be a bro'!""

I won't deny that Tyler's character was a little old to be playing with a doll. But I don't think he was annoying like a lot of fans do. Jennifer Tillys self parody is what I call the annoying part of the franchise. Even though it wasn't the same without Alex Vincent, I think Justin Whalin did an outstanding job playing Andy.

And secondly if he got mixed in with the other plastic why didn't all the dolls become chucky? That aside this was the weakest film in the series. Its not as bad as Seed of Chucky. That heaping pile of crap doesn't even deserve a review. There is a lot more humor and over the gore in this third installment. And the suspense that made the first one great is gone. Its Brad Dourfs voice acting that keeps me from giving this movie a one star. Setting the movie at military school seems like a good idea. It explains what happened to Andy. But we don't care. This movie is all about Chucky. With his one liners and over the top murder scenes. I enjoyed when he swaps the paintballs for live ammo. This movie was rushed due to Universal pushing for a sequel and it suffers. Over all its not a bad movie. But its good if your a fan of Chucky.

Child's Play 3 is darker and more disturbing, with a memorable introduction. The film may not be the best of the Child's Play series, but was good for me because of it's charm. It was very disturbing and had some of the most memorable Chucky Quotes, ""Don't **** with the Chuck"" and ""Nothin' like a Strangulation to get the Cirulation going'"". But while I have said positive things so far, here's the downside. It's the same bullshit we got in Child's Play 1 and 2. The only fresh change was that Chucky was after a new Body that wasn't Andy. Chucky's design didn't improve and the film was boring. Basically a repeat of number 2 but set in a Military Academy. Seriously, they should of got rid of Andy Barclay for this film.

Writer Dom Mancini says that because of studio pressure he had to write the script in a hurry to get it released just nine months after the second film. This only proves the lack of creativity in the story. The biggest problem of the film is the fact that it can not interest in any moment, besides the film being a bummer. The script is a complete abomination and the performances, besides being completely exaggerated, generate laughter in situations that were to be tense.

I know it looks like I might be being unfair, but to put this in perspective, I'm a fan of the original and didn't even mind the second one.The only thing positive I can think to say is that the ending was very well done. For those of you who watched the movie, I'm referring to the carnival segment. It's dark, it's creepy, it's what a voodoo slasher flick should be. They seem to take Chucky seriously in this final act and to be honest, it's one of the scariest segments in the whole franchise. Also Brad Dourif is back, which is always a good thing.Now it's time for what's bad. EVERYTHING ELSE! I detested the first two acts entirely. First of all, Military school isn't a creepy setting in the least, and Chucky looks more out of place than ever before. It's like someone wrote Chucky in at the last minute to some bad drama about a troubled teen in military school.Also they try to make Chucky scary, then funny, then scary again.

He is even more inventive with his killings(garrotting,smacking,stabbing etc) and he attempts to kill an entire military school by replacing their practice paint-balling game bullets into real slugs. The plot also involves a stupid romance between Andy and a fat girl but it doesn't really fit into the movie. Anyway the movie's about Chucky and he's great. so a 9 out of 10 for me. If you liked this i also recommend the following: child's play1+2 bride of Chucky the new out seed of Chucky Christine f/x murder by illusion 1+2rainy dog from Cyrus godlike",Child's Play 3
144,bob-405,"Could be better, but good enough.",8,7 March 1999,"Not the best of the Child's Play movies but still very good. Personally, I found the fact that poor Andy Barclay was stuck in a military school depressing and frustrating. And they couldn't have picked a worse kid to play Andy. His squeaky voice and lack of resemblance to Alex Vincent hurt the movie. But Chucky makes up for most of the flaws. I give this movie an 8 out of 10.",Child's Play 3
145,ciccowski,The best of the series,10,8 September 2009,"It is very rare when a sequel is better than the first movie. But it's ever more rare when the third movie is better than the first and the second.This is the case. This is by far the best movie from all the Chucky series. Andy is no longer a child, he's grown up and he's in the military school now. That's enough to make this movie more serious than the previous two.And that's the feeling that you get. Seriousness. Andy not only has to deal with Chucky but also with the army guys in a very unkind way. There's a feeling of pressure and anguish throughout the whole movie and there are no funny moments. Well...maybe a couple, but they don't spoil mature aspects of the movie. The lines are brilliant, the direction perfect. This is by far the best of the whole Chucky series.",Child's Play 3
146,Lelandkellman,Underrated and bashed for its low budget effects and acting,6,10 June 2019,"This movie really is not as bad as it says it is. Lots of the child's play movies are pretty bad but this one is decent. It does a lot I haven't seen in any slasher when it comes to locations and kills. I like how different it was for its time ""in that genre"". 6/10. Please give it a chance.",Child's Play 3
147,yaserb-20503,Not very fresh,5,7 October 2021,"Though there's good moments sprinkled throughout, it's a pretty average film over all.",Child's Play 3
148,oisine,A big step back,5,26 October 2021,"This a big step back for the franchise, most likely due to the incredibly rushed production. We've basically seen almost everything in this already in previous films. Not much new and creative ideas.",Child's Play 3
149,evil_ryu,'dont f*** with the Chuck' !!!SPOILERS WARNING!!!,10,4 July 2004,"this is one of the films that u see when u are a kid n then you never forget it... u get nightmares and never forget the face of that notorious killer doll,Chucky. This is in my personal opinion the best of the Child's Play series (1,2+3... Bride of chucky was pathetic) with its more humorous approach on the whole killer doll idea as well as being the more violent and macabre hence the '18' certificate. From the funny/cool one-liners such as ""Presto... your're dead"", ""nothing like a strangulation to get the circulation going"", and the one above in online summary to Chucky's violent killings and chilling laughs you know this is gotta be better than 1 and 2. the music goes alongside the most chilling scenes well such as Chucky's resurrection in the factory and scenes of death. His death scene at the end is also quite funny as he is flapping his arm and legs around before he hits the large fan and gets ripped 2 shreds! I personally regard this movie as one of my favourite films of my life (hey I'm only 14) as I watched when I was 4. I'm now looking forward 2 'Seed of Chucky'!",Child's Play 3
150,MrMikeManson,"Not Great, Not Terrible",6,5 August 2009,"::Spoiler Alert:: I see a lot of readers either love or hate Child's Play 3. I think the movie is somewhere in the middle of that. First off, it came out only 9 months after part 2 (way to fast, come on, make the people want it more) like when Nightmare on Elm St.5 came out less then a year after 4 and that movie pretty much sucked. whenever you rush out a new movie for the money, it's not gonna be as good. Also when it came out (1991) Horror was already starting to cool down (till 1996's Scream). As far as the actual movie, well if you liked part 1 and 2 then I don't see why you wouldn't like this one. It takes place 8 years after part 2, which was a good idea because we didn't need to see Chucky chasing Andy as a kid again. So Andy is now a teen and going to a Millatary School. Mean while the Play Pal Company Decides to start reselling the Good Guy Dolls (guess they didn't learn after part 1 and 2, and I guess they didn't notice a big mess of Chucky with no head and Blood coming out from part 2 before they started remaking the dolls....how would his blood not be dried up by then??? It's only been 8 years lol). So Chucky's Blood spills into the new batch of Plastic and boom he's back to life. He finds out the School where Andy is at and thus mails himself there (no comment). This little kid Tyler (who befriended Andy early on) ends up with the box and opens it (tampering with mail is a federal offense Chucky tells him) but, he decides Tyler would be a perfect new body for him to transfer his soul into. Eventually Andy finds out he's there, He trys to save Tyler from Chucky, you got plenty of side characters as well: whiteherst (the nerd), Lt. Sheldon (the prick), The Funny as hell Barber (forget his name but he's great in Hellraiser as well) and I can't remember the chicks name but there's a whole lovey dovey side plot with her and Andy (zzzz), anyway, People get killed, Chucky laughs a lot. And then there's a big ending at a Carnival. This one almost foreshadowed what the series would become with large doses of comedy and one liners from Chucky. The movie had some OK kills (I don't know why everyone says how gory this movie is....movies like Brain Damage (Dead Alive), Dawn/Day of The Dead, Evil Dead, etc., now THOSE are gory movies). So overall, I think this is a decent little movie that most horror fans would at least like, especially if your a fan of the series.",Child's Play 3
151,phoenixsong713,A Not So Bad Sequel,8,19 August 2010,"This movie is definitely not the worst of the series and even does something that not many have attempted; set the stage in a military school and end in an amusement park. Most horror movies keep to one location and you begin to wonder how anyone could be so stupid as to stay there. Another thing that I truly love about this film is the sadistic side of Chucky that we get to see (i.e. removing the ammo comprised of paint from the rifles and trading them out for live rounds) and then the inherent comedy that he starts to gain (i.e. Wiping the lipstick from his mouth and declaring war). Continuity is very much an issue in these movies, so I expected nothing less in this case. I never watch these movies expecting them to follow the story lines. I view them as individual films with the same characters. I liked the time jump, giving Andy time to become the maladjusted young man that he inevitably was going to turn out to be, and again confronting his childhood fear. All in all, a good movie and I would recommend it to others!",Child's Play 3
152,illdunkonu,I was an extra in C.P. 3,1,19 March 2005,"In 1991 I was an unfortunate attendee of a crap military school, the now defunct Kemper Military School, in Boonville, Missouri. Somehow I managed to have good enough grades to be included in the extras cast, and I am prominently visible in 3 scenes. Wow, did this movie suck, buy what else did you expect? It was, to say the least, a bizarre experience. To have all of these L.A. types dropped into the middle of B.F.E. We had quite a few laughs at their expense, for some reason a large number of the crew bought fur caps (why?!?!) in Columbia and wore them during the filming, which was in the winter. We identified them as such, ""Brown Fox Man"", ""Field Mouse Man"", ""Roadkill Beaver Man"", etc. Considering the absolute hell-hole conditions we had endured at this school, this all came as some desperately needed comic relief.The best part, the catering. I had lost roughly 15 lbs during the school year, and when they let the extras eat with the crew, we were overjoyed, I mean I can still taste the steak kabobs!I haven't really been in touch with anyone from the school since I left after that one horrible year, which makes viewing the movie now all the more surreal, like a bad dream from a previous life. Not that I've seen it recently, I wouldn't spend my money on this piece of s#*t. One note, I met the author, a Mr. Mancini, and I have to say he was a cool dude. Cheers all, but if any of you out there reading this were students there with me, go to hell.""John Floofin""",Child's Play 3
