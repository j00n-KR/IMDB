0,Leofwine_draca,Bland and lifeless,3,9 December 2018,"MOWGLI is the second of two Kipling adaptations in recent years, following on from the very similar JUNGLE BOOK back in 2016. This one's another motion capture adventure, this time directed by Andy Serkis, who turns in an expectedly bland and lifeless movie. The story takes all of the beloved Kipling creations, gives them random and overly mannered voice performances from a wealth of Hollywood talent, and wastes them in a typical story that's about everything and nothing. It's about man vs jungle, a coming-of-age for Mowgli himself, a good-vs-evil story about a killer tiger, and of course a heavy-handed political statement in which the white man is inevitably bad. I found the endless CGI to be completely lacklustre, as bad as that of INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL, so much so that you're never drawn into the tale for a moment.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
1,SnoopyStyle,tyranny of being second,7,13 December 2018,"Human baby Mowgli survives an attack by Bengal tiger Shere Khan and is rescued by black panther Bagheera. He is raised by a pack of wolves and other friendly animals. After stealing fire, Mowgli leaves the pack and is captured by the villagers. He is taken in by Messua (Freida Pinto). Staying in the village is drunken white hunter John Lockwood (Matthew Rhys). Clash between his two families is inevitable.Directed by Andy Serkis, this arrives over two years after the Disney version of the story. There are many differences in substance but all of it is moot in the face of being released second. It could never gain the success of the Disney film and is relegated to Netflix. The biggest difference is the second half of the movie. By doing so much with the villagers, the story struggles with some muddied morality. Disney is able to simplify it. This one is a darker affair. There are issues of right and wrong. I appreciate the attempt but this may be better as a two part series.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
2,claudio_carvalho,Different from the Disney´s Version,7,16 December 2018,"""Mowgli"" is an 1894 character that became famous through Disney Studios that used the public domain to promote the character. However this film is darker and different from the Disney´s version. The voices of Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett and Benedict Cumberbatch are impressive and give life to Bagheera, Kaa and Shere Khan. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Mogli: Entre Dois Mundos"" (""Mowgli: Between Two Worlds"")",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
3,nogodnomasters,I'm a wolf,10,16 December 2018,"I don't think I have to recap any of the plot. This production leans toward an older child audience. The characters are far more complex than before, making a tale, we already know more interesting. I would have preferred Scarlett Johansson to Cate Blanchett as a voice, but that is just be me.Having Gollum direct was a plus. Maybe next time we change the film to a female lead.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
4,ferguson-6,"lush jungle, terrific voices",7,7 December 2018,"Greetings from the darkness. If your idea of ""The Jungle Book"" is Phil Harris' Baloo singing a bouncy and memorable rendition of ""The Bare Necessities"" in 1967, or Christopher Walken voicing a giant orangutan in 2016, then be forewarned about this latest version of Rudyard Kipling's classic stories ... it's dark and, at times, terrifying. It's rated PG-13 to keep young kids away, so please keep your young kids away! One additional warning: this version is spectacular to look at and listen to.Of course the story is quite familiar to most, but two things really stand out here: the amazing voice acting of the world class cast, and the look of the lush jungle with its vivid colors and textures. Director Andy Serkis is renowned for his stunning motion-capture work in such franchises as PLANET OF THE APES, LORD OF THE RINGS, and Peter Jackson's KING KONG (2005) ... along with many others ... and for this project, he combines his motion-capture Baloo with top notch CGI, and the live performance of young Rohan Chand (THE HUNDRED FOOT JOURNEY) as Mowgli, the man cub.The voice acting is worth raving about. We first hear Cate Blanchett as Kaa, the ancient python, and within the first two minutes of the opening, we are captivated. Other standouts include an unnerving and intimidating Benedict Cumberbatch as Shere Khan, the always-threatening Tiger, Christian Bale (periodically lapsing into Batman voice) as the growling black panther Bagheera, Naomie Harris as Nisha the mother wolf, and a terrific Peter Mullan as lead wolf Akela. The deep cast also includes the voices of Jack Reynor, Eddie Marsan and Tom Hollander, while Matthew Rhys (""The Americans"") appears as the hired tiger hunter, and Freida Pinto (SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE) appears as Mowgli's caretaker in the man village.Many scenes are particularly captivating - some are exciting, while others quite scary. The ""no rules"" monkeys are comedic relief ... right up until they kick off one of the darkest segments of the film. And there is an ongoing theme of the fine line between being 'special', 'different', or a 'freak', and the lessons learned here would be valuable for kids ... if this were a kids' movie ... which it's NOT! Although it's difficult to discern the intended audience for this film, it's quite a visual spectacle and entertaining from beginning to end.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
5,deloudelouvain,Not really toddler material.,7,27 January 2019,"How many remakes of The Jungle Book can you produce? I guess one more after watching this version. It's different this time, not as such with the characters as those are the same, but this is just more an adult version of Rudyard Kiplings' story. Don't expect to singalong The Bare Necessities this time because there is none of those things. The story has some violent scenes so I'm not sure if you should take your toddlers to watch this version, but just stick to the cartoon from 1967 which was actually the first movie I ever saw in a theater with my grandfather. In Mowgli it's all about the CGI's which are not bad so that's worth a watch. The story is not that different but you just have no singing parts and you have more violent parts. All in all it's not a bad version, different but not bad.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
6,ElMaruecan82,"The Good, the Bad... and the Mowgli!",7,7 December 2018,"I implore you to forgive the lame pun and I sincerely hope the following review will improve the level.I only meant that there are many positive aspects about Andy Serkis' take on Rudyard Kipling's most celebrated work and a few little things it could have done without, like a few superfluous details of Mowgli's family crisis and some pompous lines of dialogues that needlessly sanctify his bond with Bagheera. But there is one spectacular performance that shines all through the film like a jungle bonfire; Rohan Chend as Mowgli. I didn't take him much seriously first but the intensity of his performance once the second act starts is really word-of-mouth material.Seriously, the crediting starts with all the 'bankable' stars who'll probably be encouraging factors and while they're not undeserving of praise, they were still only voices. For all we know Christian Bale might have voiced Bagheera wearing a Hawaiian Shirt or Cate Blanchett Kaa -yeah, they feminized him- between two ""Ocean's 8"" take but it's still Rohan Chend, all flesh and blood, who acted his way through the film and went through a nightmare s no one would have possibly imagined a kid undergoing in a family-friendly film. Or is it what Andy Serkis intended?It's hard to believe (especially when you get near the resolution) that this film tried to capture the magic of the Walt Disney version, though the beginning does have its share of deja-vu material. Serkis brings up such a dark version of Kipling's book that it might even disorient the adults. There are not many jump scares but some parts are definitely set to show you that the jungle world ain't all swing and jazz, and surviving over the most Darwinian impulse was the only reasonable necessity. I won't go further, otherwise, I might let a spoiler slip.Now, it's understandable that Serkis tried to distance himself from the pre-existing material especially after the story was rebooted by Disney two years ago, his film wasn't certainly the most anticipated of the year, so it must have been quite an ordeal to make this project marketable and he deserves some credit. What he did was expanding the gallery of characters yo the Jackal Tabaqui (Louis Ashbourne Serkis) and gives more dimension to the wolf family, community and the elder leader Akela (Peter Mullan) and he gave more gravity to the tormented Shere Khan (Benedict Cumberbatch) as Mowgli's nemesis.The result is uneven because in the end, the film still had a few cartoonish looking animals who spoke with British accents, which contrasted with the stark and gripping darkness of other scenes. It's as if the film was meant to embody the existential nature of Mowgli, the Man Cub, as an eternal in-betweener or neither-of-them, ""The Jungle Book"" is dark, powerful and meditative but lacked that little sparkle that could have appealed to a younger audience while its luxurious vegetation and lavish CGI effects are convincing and spectacular enough to draw a young audience. I'm not sure about Serkis' vision...Fitfully (or unfortunately), it's a film that looks as beautiful, fascinating yet tormented and puzzled as its central character. Still, the real added value is the character of Mowgli who's truly reinvented and instead of being the action catalyst like the Disney version kid, is presented here as a true hero and even antihero of an exciting coming-of-age story and yeah, let's use the word: character study. Maybe it just take too much time to stand on its own feet... like baby Mowgli.I would still prefer the Disney version for its sentimental and entertaining value, but I won't forget that ""Mowgli"" any soon. Overall, a pleasant surprise.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
7,ThomasDrufke,Giving the Jungle a Voice,7,19 December 2018,"Perhaps the most amazing thing about this version of The Jungle Book mythos, is done by the godfather of all things performance/motion capture, and yet, the animation and CGI is lackluster to say the least. Maybe I'm not saying this if Jon Favreau doesn't make the wildly successful and ultra realistic looking The Jungle Book in 2016, but alas, that's what we have to compare it against. Ultimately, the film separates itself from other adaptations by being darker and ""more true"" to the actual source material than previous adaptations. Cumberbatch's menacing and maniacal Shere Khan was definitely worth watching and gave us a fair share of terrifying sequences for Mowgli. And the added backstory with Khan and Mowgli's family was a bonus, but I probably could have done without some of the other human related elements, including making the choice to have the humans be the ""real villains"". However, I know there's a good story in here somewhere that Serkis had come up with, but not all of it added up to a polished product, unlike the 2016 version.7.0/10",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
8,ops-52535,truly awesome,10,7 December 2018,"Well its again the good old story about mowgli,but this edition really lifts the dust off many of the other productions.computeranimated it is,and very lively done.
the voicetalents of great actor and tresses do make this film seeworthy.there are a few small flaws in the animation quality,the rest is great.dont let tthe smallest children see it without adult attention,there are some strong parts for a child to understand ,itsa great family getogether film its a beauty....",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
9,John6Daniels,It was pretty good,10,23 October 2020,"There really isn't a villain then again there was a white blue de'hunter.It's a fantastic dramatic movie about power and a little bit of revenge.The movie made it seem like the Tiger was the villain when in fact he was the only one doing the right thing. Humans are destructive and he eliminates them. Midway you see the cruelty of the human. They hunt for fun.
Whereas the Tiger he was hunting down the humans for survival.The animals look better than the Lion King live action crap.
The voice overs were better also.
this whole movie puts 2019 Lion King to shame.I haven't seen Jon's Jungle book yet so I can't compare as yet.Only thing that bothered me was the animals and child being able to talk to each other with fluent English.
The human was found as a baby then he grows up with a British accent while in the jungle of India talking perfect English. That makes no sense.Overall a great piece of movie that's about Power and Revenge.Verdict: Great movie for all.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
10,tomgillespie2002,Struggles to find the perfect balance,6,15 February 2019,"Whenever a director needs to lend a computer-generated character a much-needed dramatic weight and dimension, Andy Serkis is all but guaranteed to be at the top of anybody's list. The actor took the breath away as Gollum in The Lord of the Rings and again as the magnetic Caesar in the rebooted Planet of the Apes trilogy. So it makes perfect sense that his directorial debut would be motion-capture heavy, with the master himself playing one of the CGI characters. Adapting Rudyard Kipling's novel The Jungle Book has long been a passion project for Serkis, and the film, which was originally entitled Jungle Book: Origins, was scheduled for a 2016 release and set to compete against Disney's own remake of their 1967 classic. To allow more time to work on the special effects, the release date was pushed back to 2017, and then to 2018. As Warner Bros. seemingly became concerned at the idea of a potential box-office bomb, the distribution rights were eventually sold to Netflix.This transition to the small screen works both for and against Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle. Although he has voiced his delight at Netflix acquiring his film, it's difficult to believe that Serkis wasn't disappointed that such a personal project wouldn't be seen on the big screen. On the other hand, this has allowed for a much darker tone, and thus bringing it closer to Kipling's original text, without any concern for classification. It's a 12A on Netflix, but I feel the censors may have requested some cuts for a cinema release, and probably rightfully so. This doesn't feature any song-and-dance numbers or King Louie, and the once-cuddly Baloo the sloth bear is now a scarred brute with a Cockney accent. The story is familiar enough, with an orphan boy being left to die in the jungle before being carried to safety by the wise black panther Bageera (voiced by Christian Bale). A wolf pack takes him in, and the boy grows up to be Mowgli (Rohan Chand), only the wolves are never quite convinced of his importance and the man-cub struggles to find his place.All is relatively happy until the fearsome, man-killing Bengal tiger Shere Khan (Benedict Cumberbatch) arrives to kill Mowgli, who he feels threatens the very jungle itself. Cumberbatch is far more terrifying than Idris Elba's incarnation, and the effects work is rather astonishing. This level of quality is not maintained however, as for every jaw-dropping close-up of Bageera's face, there is a wolf that looks bizarrely unfinished. And this unevenness runs throughout the film, not only with the special effects, but also with the tone. Serkis' attempt to deliver a different take on the story is admirable and warranted, but the darkness occasionally veers into outright horror. The climax of the film is shockingly brutal when compared to the lighter moments before, and the fate of one of Mowgli's close friends is one of the most disturbing things I've seen for a very a long time. It's undeniably jarring, and will likely scar any unsuspecting children watching for life. While Serkis may struggle to find the perfect balance, it's a bold piece of work by a thoroughly underappreciated actor that at least strives to grasp the deeper themes within the story.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
11,cruise01,Visually dark and good but story is feeling a little less inspired.,6,10 December 2018,"Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle (3 out of 5 stars).Mowgli is an okay fantasy adventure film and a different adaptation of The Jungle Book material. It is visually impressive, has a darker tone, and a big voice cast ensemble like Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Rohan Chand as Mowgli. The film does feel a little uninspired with the jungle book story. Focused a little too much on showing its visual effects and how far filmmakers can take the technology of showing motion capture with the animals. Disney's 2016 The Jungle Book live action movie is still far superior than Andy Serkis film. Mowgli is a little darker than the Disney's version. You may get a little blood shown on cuts on the animals or on Mowgli. The film's plot is similar to the jungle book story. Mowgli (Rohan Chand) was raised in the jungle. Bagheera (Christian Bale), Baloo (Andy Serkis), and Akela (Peter Mullan) all helped raised an orphaned baby boy. And Mowgli is put to the test if he is part of the pack when he is older. When Shere Khan (Benedict Cumberbatch) threatens to attack them and to go after Mowgli. Mowgli is going to have to face on who he is, if he should join the human's that are slowly taking over the forest or part of the wolf pack that he was raised from.The first hour or so of the movie was kind of slow and boring. The dark direction and visual effects were impressive but nothing eye popping that can keep you excited for. Basically, Mowgli is feeling like an outsider with the pack of animals. And after a few threatening attacks with Shere Khan. He escapes and gets captured by the people camping in the forest with John (Matthew Rhys) mentoring him and Messua (Freida Pinto) taking care of him. Seeing this human side of the story was more interesting for the rest of the movie. Mowgli learns that John is a hunter and is after Shere Khan as well. John's motives about the rest of the wildlife in the forest is not what he was expecting.There are a few entertaining action sequences. And a small battle with Mowgli and Shere Khan facing head to head. Nothing epic like the 2016 version of the movie.Overall, Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle is a fair adventure film. The story context is darker. Take out the musical and the humor of the animals. The films story does feel a little less uninspired.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
12,eddie_baggins,A pointless new take on a classic tale,5,12 December 2018,"Poor old Mowgli.Once touted as a high-profile cinema release, this big-budgeted Warner Brothers film that was original filmed in 2015 and scheduled to be released in 2016, was held back due to Disney's direct competitor The Jungle Book, that launched to dominate box-office figures and critical acclaim in that same year, meaning Andy Serkis's passion project that was developed with ground-breaking motion capture technology was given time on the shelf to be re-jigged until it has been quite clearly dumped by its studio in low-key cinema screenings and sold to streaming behemoth Netflix.It's not hard to see why a big studio like Warner Brothers decided after year's of production that Serkis's film wasn't one it wanted to risk big marketing budgets on, as this take on the classic Rudyard Kipling's novel (titled Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle) is a dark, song-free affair that's not at all targeted to younger audiences, as Serkis instead fills his A-list casted feature with a sense of foreboding dread and violence as newcomer Rohan Chan's Mowgli experiences the dark side of the jungle his been raised in almost all of his life.In some ways it's great to see Mowgli difference itself from the more breezy incarnations of Kipling's story that have hit screens in the past but it's hard to even know who the target audience is for this tale, that at the end of the day remains a relatively by the book account of the narrative that feels rather pointless in the grand scheme of things outside of Serkis showing off the ability to capture performances utilising motion capture techniques.The problem the film faces in this instance however (and disappointingly so) is that despite some gorgeous scenery and stunning animal designs, there are far too many moments where Mowgli feels haphazard in its computer generated imagery, breaking the illusion of reality far too often, giving off the feeling that despite all the year's of production and fine tuning, quality control dropped as the project seemed more and more destined to be released with little to no fanfare.It's a real shame the film feels so undercooked and somewhat sloppily put together as Serkis assembled a dream cast to bring this tale to life through performance capture and voice work.With the likes of Christian Bale as kind-hearted jaguar Bagheera, Benedict Cumberbatch as the evil tiger Shere Khan, Cate Blanchett as wise snake Kaa and Naomie Harris as motherly wolf Nisha, Mowgli features some all-round talent behind and in front of the camera and you get the feeling that with more elements gelling, this dark take on the beloved tale could've been something very special.Final Say -A film that never quite makes its mark as a new take of an age-old tale, Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle is obviously a victim of its countless delays and production issues and nothing more than a passable attempt by Serkis to look at the story with a new set of eyes and technological advancements.2 ½ long-lasting fire sticks out of 5",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
13,pennyelenabooks,Good Enough,6,12 January 2019,"I don't get why people are comparing this movie to the disney one. Disney is making movies for kids and their movie was bright and cute as it should be. This one is targeting a more mature audiance and it is dark and shows another aspect of the story. So, if you are concerned whether this one is a kid's movie or not, then I recommend you to watch it, if you like a more 'realistic' and packed with action spin of the story. Also, that kid is incredible!! I can't say the same thing about the SGI though, as they were bad and times and ruined the atmosphere and the scene.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
14,Fella_shibby,Better watch Wolfgang Reitherman's 1967 animated Jungle Book or wait for Jon Favreau's sequel.,3,30 December 2018,"Some may complain that it is a very different take from the Disney version. Fine.
Some may complain about the famous song missing. Fine.
Some may complain about the ending being a bit violent. Fine.
Some may complain about the humour missing. Fine.
But at least make it entertaining n not preachy.
The boy who played Mowgli was terrible. His facial expressions n dialogue delivery were horrendous.
Freido Pinto looked too sultry n shapely for a village girl during the colonial period.
The hunter's character was totally unnecessary.
This version looked as if it was made in a hurry.
This version will be forgotten.Wolfgang Reitherman's 1967 animated Jungle Book will always be a classic. It was full on entertainment and the character development was awesome in that.
Jon Favreau's Jungle Book will be remembered for amazing visual effects, solid vocal performances, impeccable direction n nice musical score.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

16,lisafordeay,Not as good as the 2016 Disney remake,5,7 December 2018,"Mowgli: Legend Of The Jungle is a 2018 Netflix/Warner Bros movie which was set for a release in the cinemas in 2016 along with the remake of the Disney version of The Jungle Book but was pushed back 3 years later when Netflix bought the rights for it and tells the story of Mowgli who lives in the jungle with Bagaharra(this time played by Christian Bale) and Baloo(played by Andy Serkis who directs this film and is taking over from Bill Murray) and Mowgli is in danger with Sher Khan(now voiced by Bendict Cumberbatch) who wants him dead. But will Mowglii leave the jungle to enter the man village?
First I want to talk about the good and then the badGood: Cinematography was nice and the story was different compare to the 2016 one.Bad: The animal designs are god awful and the acting is decent.
If you loved the 2016 version then you should stick to it as this version isn't on par with it.Cate Blanchett also voices Kaa the snake.

18,aidanratesmovies,Might just be the worst Jungle Book yet,4,15 February 2019,"Mowgli squanders its source material in the dark and grim, but forgets to do anything otherwise that may seem worthwhile. The special effects are quite a mess, and if anything could be less appealing, the story takes a bit of a drag toward the beginning, and the end is nothing less shocking than you have already seen before. Mowgli could have been something quite new and original, but instead it aims for the boring and the bland. This is certainly the worst we have seen from Andy Serkis, and possibly the rest of the huge celebrity cast involved with this wreck of a film. They were better off leaving this one on the shelf like before.

19,TheOneThatYouWanted,One of the best films of 2018,10,6 January 2019,Wow. Excellent film. Easily the best Jungle Book adaptation to date. More people need to be talking about this film.

20,jadepietro,"Yeah, We Know...It's a Jungle Out There!",6,8 December 2018,"GRADE: C+THIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A ho-hum retelling of the oft-made Kipling adventure tale.JIM'S REVIEW: The story of a man-cub named Mowgli appears to be a fascinating subject for filmmakers. This may be the fifth remake on the Rudyard Kipling tales about an abandoned boy who is raised in the jungle by wolves. This live action adventure is now re-adapted and directed by Andy Serkis and re-named Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle. This version is a mixed bag of special effects, some better than others, but the script is so bleak and despairing that I fear the psychological damage it could inflict on younger moviegoers.While the CGI work looks surprisingly too artificial and, in most cases, barely adequate by today's standards, the voiceover work by the cast is well done. (Kudos to Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett, Tom Hollander, and especially Benedict Cumberbatch as the evil villain tiger, Shere Khan and Mr. Serkis as that lovable bear, Baloo.) Action sequences are well staged, but the storytelling is dull. Add to that, the predictability level of those familiar with the plot (and that is many of us) interferes with the enjoyment factor.Which brings us to the point...why? Why was all this talent assembled, both behind the scene and on the screen, and green-lighted in the first place? The recent 2016 Academy Award winning live-action film version was first-rate entertainment, while Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle remains second-rate filler. There just is no comparison to Jon Favreau's film classic, which I urge any moviegoer to rent or stream if not previously seen.Callie Kloves' drawn-out screenplay rambles on, trying to adhere to the original 1894 Kipling tales and still satisfy today's modern audience. A noble effort, granted. Yet this remake is quite dark and ultra-realistic in its depiction of a violent jungle world, making it wary family fare. This end result is far too intense and impressionable for the young set. However, if you are the type of family that enjoys watching tigers chasing and devouring their prey, sit back and enjoy the bloodshed.The non motion-capture cast includes a miscast Rohan Chand as Mowgli, Matthew Rhys, and Freida Pinto. Acting-wise, all of the ""live"" actors do little to create realistic characters. The CGI creations are more lively and better animated than the ""man-cubs"" are. Fortunately, no animals were hurt in the making of this production, only the actors.In retrospect, there were just too many too man-cubs with lofty goals and limited vision involved in this movie. So let this film serve as a warning to future filmmakers: Please focus your attention on other ventures. Choose your projects cautiously. Use your talents wisely. And remember, there are enough tales of Kipling's jungle book for a generation of moviegoers to love or just endure. Unfortunately, Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle falls into the latter category.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
21,Kamurai25,A Man-Cub Can't Change Its Stripes,6,17 July 2020,"Good watch, probably won't watch again, and can recommend if you're just looking for another version of ""The Jungle Book"".I will say they definitely had the budget for a decent production value, and while Mowgli is almost the only person in the movie, I can definitely say that Rohan Chand is a great child actor, and everyone should be watching him going forward.Someone was upset that Disney had ""The Jungle Book"" made as a family friendly, charming movie, and when Netflix was giving away jobs, he jumped in and said, ""It's time for the Nolan treatment!"" and made a grittier more nuanced than intuitive version.This version goes much too far into the politics of the Jungle, and does some really strange re-casts of the characters. Baloo is almost a pirate captain, or an old military commander (because you remember how when the English conquered India, the Indian fought back on bear calvary, right?), and Louie is replaced with a friendly Kaa (still in charge of ""the monkey people""), and they specifically go into who is in the pack and who isn't and what laws are being broken. They even added a new character just to put them in the FRIDGE: I really thought we were done with that trope (it's probably a cliche now).The action is almost all flippant, it doesn't amount to much and it's all shot a little funny to me. They also added a Gaston / Clayton character as an antagonist so there are alleged twists on how both must be handled.The dialogue is mostly fine, but this is LONG, about 1 hr 45 mins, but feels like 2 hrs 30 min. The story arcs feel more like a run on sentence: looking back I can identify an establishing Act, a climatic Act, and something in the middle that must have been the 2nd act, where all the strife happens, but the weight definitely isn't equal amongst the 3. There is also no graduating: the fable aspect is long gone, there is not ""leveling"", Mowgli is the same punk kid as when the movie started, he's just stupid enough to challenge a tiger in open terrain (yes, there's more to that, but it wouldn't matter).I even like the movie, but this version takes out what little I found special from the Disney versions and replaces it with Batman levels of inner conflict over his identity.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

The message to our humanity is well packed in a jungle adventure with lot of exotic computer generated animals. The voices of them are tuned finely on each one.

I thought it's going to be very similar but it's quite different.this movie is more mature and more elaborated than Jungle Book. the actor that portrayed Mowgli is far better than that one too. storyline is interesting. voice acting is almost flawless. and some of the characters get more screentime eg Kaa.

24,Troy_Campbell,Pales in comparison to Disney's 2016 Jungle Book,4,15 December 2018,"You go decades without seeing a Jungle Book movie then all of a sudden there are two released in close proximity. Having been beaten to release in 2016 by Disney's awesome Jungle Book, Mowgli finds itself missing out on the big screen treatment in lieu of a direct-to-Netflix release. Unfortunately coming second (and to much less fanfare) has not done this Andy Serkis-directed version any favours. It's impossible not to compare the two films, and in almost every way this iteration falls short. First with the good news: the CGI is every bit as spectacular as you would expect. Serkis is the Godfather of motion capture technology and performance, so it's not surprising that the photo-realistic talking animals are nothing less than utterly convincing. He has also employed a formidable voice cast: Benedict Cumberbatch sneers gleefully as Shere Kahn, Christian Bale gives good anguish as Bagheera, Cate Blanchett hisses eerily as Kaa and Serkis himself hams it up as a roguish Baloo. But these are arguably easy wins and don't make up for the movie's very noticeable weaknesses. The biggest of these is the casting of Rohan Chand as the titular wolf-raised child protagonist; the over-acting is unintentionally funny and he's more annoying sook than likable hero. He's not helped by a clunky screenplay either, the dialogue is often wooden or on the noise whilst the plot mechanics churn with a ho-hum predictability that saps any interest generated from the 'fresh' perspective given to this age-old tale. Touted as a darker take on this property, there's also a complete lack of fun to be had. The more adventurous sequences are few and far between, and there's so much doom and gloom it's hard to be invested in the odd-ball relationships that should otherwise be endearing. Whether there was studio interference and/or a post-production tonal shuffle is unclear, but either way Mowgli limps onto Netflix in the considerably large shadow of its direct competition.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

The dark and mature tone of the movie was perfect and a fresh take on the stories, I really liked it. How they did it with Mowgli only knowing the jungle language made sense and added a small realistic take on it.The cinematography, makeup and voice acting was perfect. Seeing the animal characters getting brought to life with motion capture and great visuals made them feel realistic and stunning to look at. The ensemble cast was filled with superb actors and they didn't disappoint, great performances. I really liked the writing and how the story went on, like a coming of age story with the focus on Mowgli and it worked perfectly, the actor did a good job as well at playing Mowgli.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

31,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,Mixed Feelings,7,15 December 2018,"Had this film been released before The Jungle Book (2016), I might have liked it even more. But from the beginning of the film until Mowgli is captured in the man-village, I couldn't helped making comparisons between Warner Bros' Mowgli (2018) and Disney's The Jungle Book (2016). That first half of the film is, in my opinion, does not compare favorably with Disney's film. The CGI animation is better, the interaction between the boy and the animated characters are slightly out of sync and the screenplay in comparison to the Disney movie is very poor and filled with cliques. The characters are unoriginal and seems like characters seen in many past movies.But after Mowgli is captured, this movie seems to spring to life. Without the weak animations to hinder the second half of the film, the film becomes a lot more interesting and I get more interested in the people of the village. The cinematography improves with the atmosphere, colors and sounds of the man village. How the other children interact with Mowgli and the developing climax of the film. It is almost like two separate films edited together precisely when Mowgli is captured.For this reason, I think this movie deserves a 7 out of 10. I gave the Jungle book an 8 (more like a 8.5 in my head). The perfect Mowgli film would have been Disney's film with the second half of this film joined together into one larger film.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

Jungle Book was of course made by Disney so was a musical and I bet that a lot of you reading this know of the original version.Mowgli is a live action remake but this version adds so much more.The animals are a sheer joy to watch, the story, whilst you may know Jungle Book, this version of the classic film is different enough that it's like your watching a completely different film.With extra plot twists and turns from start to finish this is a joy to watch for all ages.Watching this now I wish I'd have seen it on the big screen but......Rating 9 out of 10",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
33,kjproulx,"A Solid Film, Released at an Unfortunate Time",8,10 December 2018,"Due to the fact that this film has been released on Netflix, I fear that many people will see the release of Mowgli as a film that's just ripping off the idea of Jon Favreau creating a live-action version of The Jungle Book back in 2015. While it does seem that way on the surface, this is a film that was in production at the same time, but since Disney was the larger company backing the film, Mowgli was put on the shelf for a few years. While I personally don't believe this movie is quite as well-made as The Jungle Book (2015), I also think it's a real shame that this movie didn't make it to theatres worldwide. Released by Netflix, people are now able to experience this new version of that classic tale and I think it's well worth your time.Lost as a child, young Mowgli (Rohan Chand) is adopted by a pack of wolves and raised in the jungle. Befriending many different species of animals, he grows up to learn their languages, not knowing that he's really a human. This film explores the classic story points of the original classic, with hints of the sequel, and a fresh third act that has been tinkered with to fit a darker storyline. This is where I felt the film excelled the most. Deviating from the source material is what's needed when you're trying to be original with something that has been done so many times in the past. This is a much more gritty and realistic take on this premise, and if it wasn't for Jon Favreau's version a few years ago, this would easily be one of my favourite renditions of this story.Sadly, Mowgli does suffer from looking far too similar to the Disney version and the motion capture isn't quite as perfected as it was in that film either. Aside from taking a few risks in terms of storytelling, this movie falls just short of everything that has already been done in 2015. That being said, I truly believe this movie would've been talked about more and much more well-received if it had stuck to its original release date and attempted a theatrical run. This is a film that clearly had hard work put into it and I believe the final product accentuates that very strongly. Where I was most impressed with this film was in the performances.While I appreciated Neel Sethi very much in the role of Mowgli back in 2015, Rohan Chand is far superior in my opinion. Due to the darker nature of this film, he is given a few opportunities to shine and he shows that he really has range, and acting against nothing even solidifies that more so. With the addition of vocal talents in Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett, Andre Serkis, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Naomi Harris, I was enthralled whenever any of the animals were speaking. There are some genuinely terrific characters moments between these animals and this is something that Andy Serkis has clearly perfected throughout his career as an actor. He has now stepped into the director's chair and I think this was a great first outing for him as a feature filmmaker.In the end, Mowgli isn't going to make many top ten lists for the year of 2018, but if you're looking for a deviation of this story and have enjoyed past renditions, I can recommend this quite highly. That being said, the core story is pretty much everything you've seen before. Mowgli is constructed in a memorable and new way which makes it so enjoyable, but if you're looking for a completely fresh movie, you won't find it here. I really enjoyed watching Mowgli for what it was. It's now streaming on Netflix and I think it's worth your time.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
34,Alexander_Blanchett,Nice re-interpretation,7,17 December 2018,"I liked that reinterpration of the well known book, that stands far away from Disney and passes without the Disney cliches.
I liked it a lot from a Story telling perspective which was exciting, not flawless but well executed. There were flaws for sure and some Story holes but I liked the darker Approach which offered some really fine twsists, some of them shocking and dramatic.
The voice actors were good. I really liked Andy Serkis' Baloo who was much different to how we know the character. Christian Bale gave a warm and nicely Twisted Performance as Bangheera. Benedict Cumberbatch's Khan was also nicely Evil. Cate Blanchett offered us an intersting Interpretation of Kaa. A perfect choice for that character.
The human cast was fine, but Nothing to write home About. I did like Rohan Chand as the Titular character, he brought the Right emotions to it, although he sometimes overacted a bit. Matthew Rhys was rather boring and Freida Pinto criminally underused.
The worst aspects of the film however were the animations, which appeared to be very second rated and definitely not on par with Jon Favereau's live Action turn a couple of years ago. It did hurt the whole experience a Little bit and I think director Andy Serkis should have put more effort into that area. Otherwise a nice fairy tale. not really for the youngest which did not hurt it.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

If you are a parent, I would suggest you view it first before letting young kids watch all of it...",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
38,ououzaza,"While the tone, visual are stunning, the story is boring.",7,14 February 2020,"I am amazed by the tone of this film. It is dark and lots of blood. The visual is stunning and savage. Voice acting is soo good especially for Shere Khan. But the problem here is the story. It seems boring, lack of character development, weird storytelling.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
39,Offworld_Colony,"Straight off the bat Mowgli has an inspired voice cast, all of whom give truly excellent voice work,",6,14 February 2020,"Which is cleverly incorporated into character animations; the actor's faces used as touchstones to morph these animals and actors together. It's really tremendous work, the ragged veteran of Serkis' Baloo and Bale's rich, old Hollywood style Bagheera and Cumberbatch's Khan are highlights. But beyond the jarring but pleasingly anthropomorphic animal cast, the remainder of the VFX seems to have been left until last because the flora and some other plates are doughy and misty and plasticky.
In terms of the rest of the cast, it's odd considering Kipling's views on colonialism to hear such a crisp English sounding Brown kid. However he is quite good and his moments of rage are authentic.
Immediately, however, some elements of the lore are confusing; such as the laws surrounding which animals can talk and which can't, why the monkeys are siding with Shere Khan, and the reasons why they didn't just send Mowgli back to the village? These questions take you out of the movie which is less than idea. And using Cate Blanchett with a cringey attempt at rekindling the success of Lord of the Ring's opening voice over falls a little flat. But aside from the that, and some dodgy pacing issues where the stakes aren't set, and the path forwards isn't easy to see, the story isn't just a retread of Disney's one.
Overall there are many fantastically conceived scenes, the one where Shere Khan is at the watering hole and Mowgli underneath for one, and the conclusion of the race for another, but the film does not end up being the sum of its excellent parts and as a whole doesn't manage to build sufficiently into anything interesting or important. It doesn't say anything really where it absolutely could have done.
I think it's kind of pleasurable and refreshing to see a Jungle Book movie where you know the broad beats and the fun is how Serkis and co. have twisted it to fit their story. It's just unfortunate that their story is just designed so that some bloody good actors can do some bloody good acting and be turned into some bloody good animals. And that's about it.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

Warner Bros' version goes real in terms of story telling as well as the looks of the animals.Baloo's lips, the wolves in general, the little details with the elepphant or the cow(s) show the true nature/ look of the jungle than portrayed in the Disney's 'The Jungle Book' where everything looked sweet and beautiful, fun and enjoyable and was definitely targeting the kids (after all it's the Disney). What we see in Disney's version is just half of Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle.I do understand the motion capture hasn't gone well. I didn't like it even in 'The Planet of the Apes'.

46,patriciogl10,Andy Serkis provided.,8,7 March 2019,"Having seen Jon Favreau's version of the Jungle Book, I was curious to see what could Andy Serkis add to his version that it would make it different, or even stand out above the other. I can safely say that JF's version definitely feels more family-friendly (Disney) and Andy Serkis' feels more mature, dark and serious in tone.
Comparing the two, I definitely liked the CGI better in JF's Jungle Book, it was better accomplished. Regarding how the story unfolded I definitely prefer Mowgli. Benedict Cumberbatch portrayed a highly menacing and vile Shere Khan, which is one of the aspects that made this film as dark as intended.
Another element which aids in successfully scoring a more somber tone is in fact the tonality of colors used in the movie along with the lighting. The story shows us a boy raised among wolves who himself identifies as one of them but still feel like it's not quite right. So we deal with his search for his true identity while he still longs to be one of the pack.So it is better than Favreau's version? To me it is, I enjoyed a darker take on this well-known story. But you can watch both of them and be the judge for yourself.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
47,pranayjalvi,It was dark but blatant,3,8 December 2018,Mowgli was expected to match the attention which 'The Jungle Book' created couple of years back. The movie was dull and there was just no moment (except the Shere Khan vs Mowgli Fight at the end) which was eye pleasing or something which I can say better than the Jon Favreau directorial. This is totally disappointing and Andy Serkis failed to deliver the magic which Jon Favreau gave us.

49,jacksflicks,"Finally, a Mowgli Worthy of Kipling!",9,9 December 2018,"It's dismaying how many here regard Disney as the benchmark for The Jungle Book and its central character Mowgli. The benchmark is Kipling's book!For over a century the fantasy life of young boys and girls was informed by the self-contained story-chapters in the Jungle Book, not all about Mowgli. Kipling was a story teller, who could fire the imagination of kids, which Nobel recognized in one of their wiser prizes. Unfortunately, Disney ruined it for kids by cartoonizing the Jungle Book and turning into a silly musical.There's a beautiful Korda version of the Jungle Book, from 1942, starring Sabu as Mowgli. Due to the constraints of having animals speak, most of that movie focuses on the humans and in a way closer to the Kipling version. The ripe technicolor of the restored print and the soundtrack of Miklós Rózsa make for an exotic, faraway, almost dreamlike experience. Find this one and compare the Mowglis. I think Sabu and Rohan Chand are wonderful, in their own ways.The Serkis Mowgli takes advantage of modern CGI to give the animals articulating mouths to speak the lines, so we can be in the jungle more. Though most of the characters are original, Serkis has replaced Shere Khan's sidekick Tabaqui's jackal with a hyena, maybe because hyenas are more grotesque. No biggie. Serkis has departed further from the Kipling plot, but in ways that don't spoil the basic story.The very end is good enough, but in the Kipling, Mowgli is finally drawn back to the humans by one of them he's oddly curious about--a girl. I thought that was a charming way for Kipling to end it. But the way Serkis chooses to end the film is fine. I'd have given an 8, but add 1, because this movie has done a great service in rescuing Kipling and us from Disney.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
50,Avwillfan89,"A strange, uneven, yet beautiful Netflix film",8,8 December 2018,"This film took a long time to come out due to avoid going into competition with Disney's live action version. The critics were brutal with this one due to its disjointed storytelling and dark tone.This film is no masterpiece. But neither is it a failure. It's a more faithful adaptation to the Kipling books. The reason why the storyline is fragmented, meaning you could stop the movie for a while, watch it again and it would feel like a different story, is due to the source material itself. The Jungle Book is not a novel but an anthology of different stories, ones that not all involve the man cub Mowgli.For those complaining that it's too dark, all you need to do is turn on the Discovery Channel to see how close this film is to the actual wildlife.As for the characters, I found them fascinating. I especially loved the relationship between Mowgli and Bagheera. Baloo, while not as vicious as in the book, is no cuddly singing and dancing bear. He's a gruff, scarred drill sergeant who teaches Mowgli the ways of the jungle. Shere Khan is not so much ""the lame one"" as described in the book, but the grim reaper - horrifically terrifying and dangerous.I also really liked the addition of a white hunter in the mix - who is a metaphor for British colonialism. He is initially hired to kill the tiger, but not only does he not do a very good job of it, he drinks and kills other animals for the purposes of taxidermy, including several of Mowgli's friends.Overall, you could pick any individual scene from the film, and it would still look beautiful. I'm looking forward to seeing what Andy Serkis does with Animal Farm, his next project.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
51,scb_coldsteel,A very lackluster adaptation filled with recycled moments.,5,23 December 2018,"So I saw the new film Mowgli on Netflix. I was actually kind of looking forward to this. Netflix originals are kind of a mixed bag, but Andy Serkis is the king of motion capture acting so I thought it was worth my time. Overall it was a very lukewarm experience.The plot of the movie is familiar as always. We all know the classic story of The Jungle Book from Disney, but this adaptation tries to follow a darker route. A young boy is raised by a family of wolves and attempts to fit in the animal kingdom while struggling with his on humanity. All the while he is hunted by the tiger Shere Khan who brutally murdered his family. All of the iconic Jungle Book characters are present and the same story arcs and plot progressions are accounted for.You may ask why does this movie exists if it's so similar to the other adaptations of a Jungle Book? That's a great question, one that doesn't really have an answer. While the film has a darker tone it just doesn't do anything to warrant its existence. There are certainly a few differences, but this film just does not add anything new to the existing Jungle Book mythos. It largely recycled a number of iconic moments without the whimsical charm of a Disney filmThe film also had a fundamental problem with finding its voice. It wants to be a gritty dark version of the Jungle book. It does have some adult themes about anti-colonialism, nature versus nurture, and trophy hunting that younger audiences won't get. It also has a bit more gore and bloodshed compared to the Disney films. Unfortunately it also tries to splice in kid-friendly moments of comedy that just feel out of place. Who exactly is this film for? It can be too dark for kids, but not structured or serious enough for adults?Now the animation is good, but not great. The problem is everything CGI just didn't feel real at all. It just sort of looked out of place when the actors interacted with the CGI animals. There was quite a bit of detail on the animals that gave them a bit of personality, but it is not a film that will leave you dazzled, particularly in comparison to the current Disney offerings.The film has an absolutely phenomenal voice actors. Andy Serkis, Christian Bale, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Cate Blanchett. Unfortunately none of them other than Andy Serkis gave a memorable performance. Voice acting is tough and Andy Serkis is a master of his art. He completely brings life to Baloo the Bear. He was easily to be part of the film.The young actor who played Mowgli Rohan Chand was actually pretty good also. He did everything you could want out of the character and did well considering the source material. For a relatively unknown child actor he is certainly someone to watch in the future.This of course was Andy Serkis first time as a sole director. I really wanted to get behind the movie because I'm a fan of his acting career. Unfortunately this movie suffered from amateur directing. The tone of the film was off plus the narrative seemed slowed by unnecessary moments and story arcs. All around the film could have benefited from a more experienced director.So Mowgli certainly had its moments as a movie. I was entertained for the most part, unfortunately this is a film that sits under the massive shadow of Disney. The film just feels unnecessary. All of the whimsical and wonderful elements found in Disney just are not here. The film also greatly suffered from an uneven tone and some amateur directing. A 5.5 out of 10.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
52,Boristhemoggy,Not one of the best versions of this classic story,3,9 December 2018,"The CGI in comparison to that of recent years is very poor. Look at the last Planet of the Apes film. There is no comparison at all. Animal behaviours and general styling is poor, and at times it looks almost like student work it's so poor.

Things begin to get a little tense and before long Mowgli is in Trouble as is Bagheera and Baloo and Human interaction is needed, But is it the right interaction?The final scenes of the film are the most action packed, will Shere Khan win and take the jungle under his rule?a great little fantasy, adventure film, harmless and kept me entertained throughout and yes it brought back my childhood a little with all the characters albeit in live animation. well worth the 8/10 i gave it... i cant wait for Dumbo next",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

59,pritol,Closer to the true Jungle Book...,7,24 June 2020,"The original Jungle Book stories are much darker than the happy sing along version portrayed by Disney... and whilst the Disney versions are fantastic, it is refreshing that this rendition takes a darker line in its story telling.Some artistic license is taken in the story narrative, but the changes made do help keep the story simple as supposed to maintaining all the weaving parts of the original tale.The stop motion capture and vfx are as you would expect, incredible, with some truly brilliant voice work being carried out.The movie did feel a little rushed at times, and if it had taken its time to explain or flesh out certain story elements, especially Mowgli's time growing up in the Wolfpack, his time in the human village, and how he plans to stop Shere Khan, that would have been brilliant.All in all though, the darker take is truer to the source material which is a nice change, and actually in my opinion more enjoyable to watch than the recent Disney live action remake...

It was a hugely dumb idea.I hated the Disney CG Jungle Book because of the godawful, cringe-worthy singing and for the monotone and totally wooden Johansen Kaa voice. Other than that, it was amazing - and the animals actually looked like the real thing.With this film, everything an animal's face is shown, I keep looking at their weirdly mutated faces instead of being drawn into the story.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
61,jaredpahl,"Boring and Tedious, This Film Is Lost in the Jungle",4,2 January 2020,"By whatever strange twist of fate, I think I have seen just about every adaptation of Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book ever made. I've seen the big ones obviously, the animated Disney classic and its live-action remake, but also the 1994 Stephen Sommers version and the splendid 1942 original. That is not to mention the straight-to-video versions I saw as a kid. Hell, I even saw The Jungle Book 2 in theaters. Strangely enough, I have liked all of them to varying degrees. The core story by Rudyard Kipling is just that appealing and the iconic imagery is somehow uniquely attractive to me. With that in mind, it's quite a shock to me that I was so put off by director Andy Serkis' newest adaptation.Serkis' Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle is basically a variation on the same formula that every Jungle Book adaptation has adopted, which is in itself a variation on the themes of Kipling's stories. There is a young boy named Mowgli. He is raised by wolves. The jungle boy is looked after by a wise panther named Bagheera and is friends with a jovial bear named Baloo. His enemy is a tiger named Shere Khan, who has a vendetta against Man. Most Jungle Book adaptations put a twist on the raw material, be it animation, songs, swashbuckling adventure, or epic scope. Andy Serkis' film attempts, I guess, to bring an adult sensibility to the classic tale. I say I guess that was Serkis' take because that is not what ends up on the screen. Mowgli is neither a dark retelling of The Jungle Book nor a family friendly romp. It's an inert hybrid of the two. Accounting for a moment or two of violence, Mowgli doesn't do anything to make itself tangibly adult. There are still colorful talking animals and humorous adventures. The dark elements are tacked on as a way to score some quick points for ""gravity"" or ""emotional weight"". That doesn't work.There is a lot that doesn't work with Mowgli. In particular, the voice acting. Christian Bale is awful as Bagheera, the paternal panther. He's brought back his gruff Batman voice to the role and it's a giant miscalculation. If the aim was for something with gravitas or maturity, the result is forgettable white noise. Bale is a personality void. So are the equally talented Cate Blanchett, Naomie Harris, and Benedict Cumberbatch. Dull and unenthused work all around. The only voice you'll even remember is Andy Serkis' Baloo, and that's only because of the thick cockney accent. Explain that acting choice.Rohan Chand as Mowgli is a pestilent nuisance, all feminine and clean and fake. Not to harp on the kid, but between the perfectly quaffed hair, the constant overacting, and his tendency to open his mouth really, really wide whenever he's called on to perform a dramatic scene, I didn't much like looking at this brat.On the topic of things I didn't like looking at, why not mention the visual effects? After about 20 years, I'm starting to realize that CGI animals are tough to create. There has never been a movie that achieved true photorealism. However, this movie has the unfortunate task of being held up against its big Disney brother, a film that had effects about as good as can be achieved with this technology. If the Disney Jungle Book remake was storybook realism, this is digital gloop. Every animal we're meant to see with awe, looks like any other computer generated... whatever. Man this stuff gets tiresome.I can't really muster the energy to be mad at Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle. It isn't as controversial as it thinks it is. Putting a #dark filter over a reheated Disney leftover doesn't make your film ""provocative"". It just makes it dull. If like me, you love Rudyard Kipling's ingredients, then watch any other adaptation. At least you'll find something with a pulse.41/100",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

63,Endless_01,Unique and enjoyable.,7,9 July 2019,"I am not a very related person to the original works of the Jungle Book, however I believe that this adaptation works as a good form of entertainment expressed in a unique and daring way. It is a film with dark and realistic tones that shows us hard moments to chew and with violent moments and personifications of bloody villains. It is not a gore work, no, but it is a film that manages to manifest itself in a more mature and complete way through a graphic and realistic presentation of wildlife. Obviously, the animals talk and that is not realistic, but it works in the field of the narration of this film, that's what it's all about.Mowgli is presented with a strong structure and excellent animation works, although somewhat rough at certain moments and slightly inferior to the previous live-action, however, it makes a solid work with special effects and the performance of voices is especially good from all the characters (actors) within the film. The plot is interesting and simple enough to follow with attention and shows us unique and dynamic characters that captivate our eyes and ears. It is an entertaining film, with great potential, perhaps could have been more dramatic or intense, taking a narrative more focused on the evolution of Mowgli as a man, but the film still manages to remain stable with a simple and entertaining premise, as good adaptation, that I do not know, but as a film, it is.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

65,simonrosenbaum,Whose this for?,3,26 May 2019,I wasn't exactly expecting a Disney type film but I can't see who would enjoy this film. It's far too dark for children to watch and yet there's no levels of story humour or characterization that adults would appreciate so it ends up being very straight forward and predictable making it a very banal experience. Basically I couldn't stay awake for much of it.,Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
66,Dannyboi94,"Entertaining, but it's missing something",7,7 December 2018,"Mowgli is definitely not for children, there are scenes where it seems that way, with some cartoon like characters and some of the playful nature of some scenes, but deep down this is dark. You can tell the filmmakers tried to make an even darker film here, but perhaps this suffered along with its troubled production.Andy Serkis directed this movie, and he does a fine job as his first attempt at a film like this. The motion capture on the animals is fantastic, and each performance is nailed by their actor. With Benedict Cumberbatch being a stand out. You can tell he channelled his inner Smaug for this role. Christian Bale was also fantastic as the panther, Bagheera, as was every other voice actor. But the stand out performance was by the young Rohan Chand. He was brilliant as Mowgli. Not many actors can perform in front of CGI characters and make it work. A lot of people will compare this to the Disney version that came out a few years ago, but that is inevitable, however Rohan gave a far superior performance than the actor who played his counterpart in the Jungle Book.Most of the other characters were not of much interest, with some of the human characters just standing in the background not doing much. However some scenes with them are haunting, and will leave a mark on you. Dark and twisted scenes play out during these human scenes, with dead animals, showing how cruel humans can be. Not for kids people!There are some issues with the film, from its off pacing during the first act. A lot of scenes jumped back and forth and it was difficult to tell what was going on at times, but it found its footing half way through. Some of the CGI looked dreadful in scenes, but others - mainly the landscapes, were breathtaking. The human-like CGI animal faces were bizarre at first, but after a time, it kind of worked.My personal biggest issue with this film is that it lacked any kind of charisma. It felt took dark and bland at times, with little humour. Maybe this is because I couldn't help but compare it to the Jungle Book, like so many others will. It is a shame, because Mowgli is a very entertaining movie, with fantastic performances.Despite its flaws, Mowgli is a good film, it is a shame it didn't get enough love to be released worldwide, with its full potential, because it could have surpassed the Jungle Book, but it didn't. But nonetheless, Mowgli is entertaining.7.2/10",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

68,El-Ak,Disney's was better though this is full of more stories.,6,3 February 2019,"Since I heard that Netflix bought the movie and I nearly was sure that it wasn't gonna be better than the first as they have movies with a certain vision. The movie really has a very awesome picture and cast but I have to say that Andy's direction wasn't that good. At first, The Visual effects and the animals movements wasn't at the required level for such film which was a big surprise though it's good but I can notice that their faces and reactions doesn't seem right as Disney's which is strange as Andy did a great job as Caesar before. Also the screenplay was the worst for me along with the leading boy who seems doing what is said to him to get the best epic scene but it doesn't turn out well from him or the director at certain scenes and wasn't convincing at all along with the naive ending of the film. The movie's music was good and the rest of the cast did a great job specially Bale , Benedict and Serkis. The story although it went to some points that Disney's story didn't get to as the humans part but all that was quickly and short and the actions depending on it was more that overrated. But the movie didn't lack the entertainment at all which made it very enjoyable to watch especially the chasing scene at the beginning and the wolves race.

69,ajzeg,"This movie was a well-made tech demo, but it leaves a lot to be desired as a movie.",4,15 September 2019,"The story is really weird and all over the place. It feels way too fast paced and short in a lot of places, and I'm not sure exactly what this movie is trying to be. It's not a faithful adaptation of Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book, but it isn't really doing its own thing either. It's like a weird mix of the two. Also, the message of the film was really odd. It had an anti-trophy hunting message or something like that, which is not what The Jungle Book is about at all as far as I know! However, what really makes this movie are the effects and the performances. It's important to note that this movie is directed by legendary performance-capture artist Andy Serkis, who you may know best as Gollum from The Lord of the Rings. The human actors all do a great job, and the movie features some great performance-capture technology on the animal characters. They are less realistic than the 2016 Disney version, but that allows the animal characters to be more expressive, which I think makes it look a lot better. As for which one is a better film, I'd say both Mowgli and the 2016 Jungle Book are about the same in my mind. They are both special effects tech demos that leave a lot to be desired in the story area. Mowgli is worth checking out if you're curious, it is a Netflix original so you got nothing to lose, but don't expect the definitive film interpretation of The Jungle Book.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
70,christophershobris,Wasted Potential,4,11 December 2018,"Here's my journey through this film Mowgli. The beginning was really good and impressive, the environments looked gorgeous, the story was faithful to the book and it looked like all of my doubts about the film went away. For a good 30 minutes I was thoroughly enjoying myself. The character design took a little time to get used to, but I ended up accepting it. The voice acting and motion capture performances were outstanding, especially Christian Bale as Bagheera. He was the best character in the entire film. Unlike the Disney version where he is very stern, and protective of Mowgli, here he is softer and very fatherly to Mowgli which I liked. So everything was all good, until the second half to the end of the film. This is probably when Serkis found out his film was not going to be theatrical but put on Netflix instead. Either that or Serkis just lost interest in some way, that's the only way to explain it, because the last half to the end of the film totally fell flat story wise. Everything I praised above still were involved. However, the story felt so rushed as the scenes had no flow to them and no impact. The end was the worst, the film ended so abruptly. The acting by Rohan Chand as Mowgli was over the top, Baloo's design was scary and Akela looked remarkably fake, these two were the only character designs I couldn't get used to. Kaa was once again underused and has a confusing story line, Shere Khan was wasted despite having Benedict Cumberbatch as the voice and motion capture. There is a fight between two characters that pissed me off, and this film could have benefited from being 2 hours and 30 minutes long. What the heck happened to a film that started out promising, but ended so terribly? I blame it mostly on Warner Bros. for not having full confidence in Andy Serkis and cowardly dumping it on Netflix, but also partial blame has the go to the writers and Serkis himself. Serkis' film was doomed as soon as Jon Favreau's film was released and received worldwide praise, and I think this had something to do with it, but even without Favreau's film this one would still have problems. No film is perfect, but we'll never know what this film would have been like if Favreau's film didn't exist, I'm just speculating. But as it is, the film was wasted potential with some excellent voice work and motion performances especially from Christian Bale, he's the one thing that keeps the film watchable. It's not a total failure, but certainly could have been so much more than was it is. Sorry Warner Bros., Disney and Jon Favreau won this battle. 4/10",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

79,because-of-him,Nothing believable.,1,9 December 2018,"A good movie should be believable, even if it is a fantasy. This movie requires the viewer to set aside common sense.
Its biggest fault is the indoctrination that man is only evil and destructive, whereas nature is pure, perfectly balanced and has no stench, no illnesses, no diseases, no bacterias.
And, against beliefs, the animals can communicate with one another, are super intelligent, and mostly kind to one another.
The very first spoken line by the politically deceptive narrator is this, ""I saw the coming of man; and the jungle struggling to survive.""
Thus, if you eliminate man, you allow natural perfection. And, the only acceptable 'human' is one that follows the laws of the animal kingdom.

81,Eiriksterminator,Much better than the Disney version in my opinion.,8,7 December 2018,"As usual the critics have no taste, and their opinions don't match up with the general populace (aside from a few weird individuals who gave this movie a ""1""...Yes, very much worth taking seriously...lol). This movie is better than the Disney version, not the other way around. Credit where credit is due, the Disney version has more realistic CGI (though the characters look more menacing in this version than in the Disney one, so that's a plus), possibly as a result of a better budget, though maybe not. Everything else though, is better in this version. It's much more faithful to the books. It is much darker and more mature than Disney's version, which to some I suppose might be a minus, while for the rest of us it's a huge plus. Depends on what you're looking for in the movie. Most importantly, the voice acting in this version is waaaayyyy better than in Disney's version (I'm really shocked and in disbelief to see that one reviewer thinks the voice acting in Disney's version was better, like, what?). Benedict Cumberbatch is absolutely perfect as Shere Khan, and blows Idris Elba's performance, which was already very good, out of the water. Cate Blanchett as Kaa (who thankfully has much more screentime and relevance to the story in this version) is soooo much better than Scarlett Johansson that it's not even funny. She has a much more powerful presence.Don't get me wrong, I like Disney's live action remake of their movie. It was good, and I enjoyed it. But this one is definitely the superior of the two. If you want to watch a darker and more mature version of the story without all the jolly Disney songs, give this one a watch. Personally I absolutely loved it.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
82,BillSims28,"Visually Stunning, Well-voiced, Narratively Lacking",6,12 February 2019,"Andy Serkis' second foray into directing is an ambitious attempt to retell Kipling's classic jungle tale in a less Disneyfied manner. However, it suffers from a fundamental lack of narrative freshness which prevents it from ever reaching the lofty heights it aspires to.It would be hard to criticise the look and sound of the film, which is undeniably gorgeous. The utilisation of Serkis' motion capture expertise through the use of his Imaginarium studio allows for the creation of some marvellously expressive creatures. The jungle is exquisitely realised, with luscious foliage and lively animals filling the scenery.The voice cast also excels. Christian Bale imbues Bagheera with graceful, powerful wisdom and Benedict Cumberbatch lends his impressive voice to a menacing Shere Khan, whilst Serkis throws himself into crafting a gruff Cockney Baloo that would probably sooner glass you if you spilt his pint than sing about the Bare Necessities. Peter Mullan and Tom Hollander are also impressive in the supporting voice cast, each of their characters benefitting from the added darkness that this adaptation provides. Cate Blanchett rounds things off with some Galadriel-esque omniscient narration.The film's positives are limited to this, however. The films unfortunately suffers from extreme tonal imbalance, unable to decide whether it wants to be a slightly darker version of its family friendly 2016 counterpart or a fundamentally different creation which occupies a unique space in Mowgli mythology. It ends up somewhere in the middle, too tame and prosaic for adults whilst being surely too dark for kids. From scene to scene there are jarring shifts in the atmosphere of the film, giving it a choppy feel of hasty re-editing.The story also lacks any of the zip that previous versions of this tale have benefitted from. There are stretches of time which drag without development, before a rushed and dissatisfying ending. The human characters are too underdeveloped to hold much interest, though young Rohan Chand tries his hardest throughout.It is unfair for 'Mowgli' to have been released without fanfare so close to Jon Favreau's Disney adaptation, and unfavourable comparisons are thus inevitable. Both are decently enjoyable, but as is often the case with remakes neither come close to matching the unabashed vivacity of the original. 58/100",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

Don't expect it to be too similar to The Jungle Book. Mowgli is a more adult oriented film with some dark tones which I appreciate. I was very more focused on the actors. Everyone stands out. Even some actors that have small, but important roles. The CGI was the only thing that got under my skin. Some scenes had excellent visual effects, then exceptional, and then just plain horrible CGI. It feels like an unfinished film and took me away from the movie for a while. Maybe Warner Bros cut the films cost when they decided to go to Netflix. I feel really sorry for Andy Serkis. If Warner Bros would have let Serkis finish Mowgli. It would have been better than Disney's version and Andy Serkis would get more praise when he clearly earns it.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
86,Badmoviessuck,It feels like they are pushing a political agenda,6,16 December 2018,"This movie is wasted potential cause of one reason Mowgli's character.CHARACTER
Most of the characters don't get developed and it's only Mowgli who gets focused on during the movie.
Development is important when it comes to characters such as Bagheera and Baloo cause they are important characters in this movie that should have had a bigger impact in the movie.
Mowgli is a bland, mediocre character cause of him having unclear desires.
We get to know who Mowgli is in the beginning of the movie which is great and so far then he is a good character.
He has a clear desire and that is to be with the wolves and hunt but as soon as he fails the test the movie gets worse.
His desire shifts because he lives with the humans and now he dosen't want to be with the wolves but the wolves need him and they want him to come back but Mowgli decides to be with the humans instead.
When Mowgli helps the wolves he says that he is neither a wolf or human and he got that quote from that snake, and that snake said that Mowgli isn't both human and wolf or neither human or wolf. Then what is he?
He is biologically a human male. I swear to god it feels like they are pushing some political agenda like it's okay to identify yourself how you want, and i hope they are not pushing a political agenda.
But now his new desire is to kill the villain which is an undeveloped desire that gets shoved in the story so that they could end it.
And in the end we never get to see how he changes as a person nd how he grows as a greater character.VILLAIN
Shere Khan is a bad underdeveloped villain.
His motive to kill Mowgli is unclear to me but i think is that Mowgli is a human and Shere Khan likes humans so he want's Mowgli even though he could go on a rampage in a Village filled with humans.
Again i don't really know his motive to kill Mowgli but i hope it's not the one i just said.VERDICT
Andy Serkis has potential to be a good director but there was something that went wrong when directing this movie cause this movie is a wasted potential.
I think you should support Andy Serkis and watch this movie cause i know that he can do better and this movie isn't that bad",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

But Anyway, The Practical Effects Are Excellent, It's Gorgeous To Look At, And The Voice Acting For The Animals Is Excellent, And The Coolest Aspect Of The Animals Is That They Look A Lot More Human, It's Really Impressive But It Makes Us Relate With Them A Lot More Than In The Previous Films. If You're Looking For The Most Accurate Adaptation Of Rudyard Kipling's Story, This Is It. On A Side Note, Since I Found Out The Source Material Is Much More Gruesome Than The Movies, Now I Hope Someone Will Go All Out And Make An R Rated Adaptation, It Is Possible And I Could See It Happening",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

The voice actors is famous actors like Christian Bale playing Bagheera, Benedict Bumberbatch and of course Andy serkis as Baloo and with a mix of good cgi and great voice actors brings the characters to life in a extraordinary way!Now to the story itself. Is not the original tale of ryard kipplings tale of boy in the jungle , this is diffrent and darker.Mowgli gets 8/10 and the best version for the jungle book yet.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
89,rogier-86785,Impressive yet off beat,4,9 February 2019,"Mowgli is one of those visually stunning movies that falls short - even flat - on the story front. The film we get has truly excellent performances from the various voice actors. They revel in it, you can feel it. And although some CGI seemed a little 'wooden', overall the visuals of the animals were good, visceral even.This gives it a grownup illusion, yet it also has odd moments clearly meant for little children. Basically all of its writing is so full of cliches it utterly shattered the fourth wall for me. This results in sequences so slow and drawn out, it needs to rely on overblown, horribly cliched music to make any emotional connection.So, however impressive some of its aspects are, ultimately Mowgli is off beat in both pacing and timing, suffers from exposition and the most cliched violins ever. It all becomes so melodramatic I couldn't help but cringe through almost all of it.Darn, I hate giving a negative score to an Andy Serkis film... it is clearly made by very talented people who loved doing this project. But this score goes beyond a movie that just didn't come together. It's more than bad luck. Clearly, it was a storytelling mistake to try to constantly jerk the tears from our eyes.And I can't help compare this to 2016's The Jungle Book either. That movie blew me out of my seat. This definitely did not do that.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

92,vg40,WORST JUNGLE BOOK BASED MOVIE,2,2 February 2019,"When I heard that a new movie on Kipling's Jungle Book has been made, I thought it will show something new: another point of view, a different ending, additional scenes... those are great reason to remake a movie, right?I was very sorry to see that I was wrong. This movie offers nothing to the viewer. In fact it only makes everything worse. In this age, when our jungles are suffocating with pollution and suffering with deforestation, they could have developed an interesting story line related to it. Nope, instead they show how badly the jungle needs a man(cub) to take care of it. They show how ridiculous the laws of the jungle are and how it is acceptable that a man interferes with them. In this age, when we still have to discuss racism and cultural appropriation, they have cast the fairest skinned boy to the lead role and added an unnecessary white character with unnecessarily much screen time. They have created an Indian village that looks like no place in India ever looked (the dresses and behaviour are a mix of several places; moreover it was all filmed in Africa and a studio) and given Hindi dialogues to actors who don't know how to pronounce them. If you enjoy actual, old fashioned orientalism, you better watch the lovely 50s version.And a lot of people said it's dark, but it isn't dark, it's boring. At least the Disney version had some exciting scenes.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
93,mrinalmmehta,My Review!,5,29 August 2019,"All the wait, excitement, I'm afraid, it was almost for nothing. The graphics of the animal characters in the movie was odd. They all looked not the way they should have. The cast is fantastic and strong. The characters in the story were played by some of powerful actors and boy-o-boy, it just pumps up the excitement. Benedict Cumberbatch gave flavour to the story. The character, Mowgli, looked and behaved like he was raised in the Jungle which is a big plus point than the 2016, The Jungle Book. I had big hopes for this one. I hate to say, I'm feeling low now. There were so many times, I felt, 2016 version was way better. Why was this one Netflix-ed? Hm, wondering. Saturday night didn't go as i thought it would.Peace Out!",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
94,webwizardbe,"Finally, a bad ass Mowgli in an even more mysterious jungle",7,9 December 2018,"I agree with most of the positive reviews. The adaptation to a much darker jungle world works. So to start, the story works, it keeps your attention from beginning to end, well written and not too long or too short for what it had to offer.
The acting of the kid is superb, he's a perfect wild Mowgli. The animals looked and are much more freightening than in the original story. The animal CGI is very well done throughout the whole movie, but sometimes the production is a bit meager with the scenery (the very short & rapid sequences).
Overall, a very entertaining dark fairy tale that every adult will enjoy.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
95,Dibyayan_Chakravorty,The Worst and Unnecessary Remake Ever,3,15 May 2019,One of the worst remakes I have ever seen. Really not needed to make this film after 2016's grand hit 'The Jungle Book'.

97,ercfunk-445-950046,Could be better,6,9 December 2018,"It seems to have most of the elements that could make it a good movie but falls just a little short. One of the things that's odd is the CGI. It's not bad quality as the textures and color look good, but the shapes seem off. Shere Kahn's head seemed oddly wide, the wolves looked cat-like, Baloo looked like a post apocalyptic bear or something. The story and acting were decent.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
98,gbidari,"Cool premise, Doesn't deliver",5,11 December 2018,"Really really wanted to love this, but the surprisingly green screenwriting from Kloves, daughter of a screenwriter who pretty much only adapts Harry Potter, dragged this down from the get go. Telling instead of showing, weak narration... The plot points were all wrong and I was beyond bored only 50 minutes in. The acting and directing definitely saved this from being a total waste but was no match for a bad screenplay. The CG is a little weird and certainly uneven. I did kind of enjoy the Mocap aspects. This is 100% proof it's not what you know; it's who you know. While this is supposed to be a close adaptation, it's unclear who this is for. It's not kid friendly, but it doesn't get it right for adults either. Nice score.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
99,bogdanbalostin,I never watched the Disney version,7,23 May 2019,"Well, it's not boring. And you know the story, very predictable until the very end. Despite all these, it's not boring. The animals are truly frightening, I don't know why. Usually, animations make me want to pet fake animals but in this ones every one of them looked savage. That's a plus for me.It's not so dark as many others say, it's close to what a real jungle is and even so, that Mowgli survived in there even though he doesn't look prepared at all says something about the nature of the jungle (not so dangerous). There are 2 scenes that are pretty heavy in that they suggest, but I was expecting them because of the real law of the jungle, the strong survive, the weak die, simple as that. I think now that adults will appreciate this more than children.If you're not a fan of Disney and happy predictable story, watch this instead.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

The makers of this take don't hide the fact it's much darker than other versions of the story. But it can't be overstated that this is too fierce and too heart-stopping at times for small children. Not all kids would be frightened, but I would have as a small boy. The CG was actually quite good. The story focusing on Mowgli in the way it did was quite nice. And the names associated with this project were strong. I give it a solid B in most areas. My main beef is still with Rudyard Kipling for giving us something with a python as a character.

109,Abhinav009,"Finally, the original version of The Jungle Book!!....",9,8 January 2020,"Whenever Rudyard Kipling's classic tale of the Indian jungle and Mowgli has been portrayed on screen, be it through animation or live-action cinema, there has been a significant detour from the original book of the author. The characters, the jungle and some parts of the story are borrowed and liberties are taken to create their own version of the jungle book.Most of the times, this has worked and even though the story was different from the book, the makers didn't disappoint. Jon Favreau's ""The Jungle Book"" was particularly magnificent because the Sher Khan they created was so powerful and fearsome that he easily became one of the best villains of animation/live-action.But his version was also different from the original story, with a lot of original characters missing. So what makes ""Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle"" special and unique is that this is the first movie ever that has stayed as close as cinematically possible to the original Rudyard Kipling masterpiece.From Sher khan being a cripple to Mowgli's original wolf brothers given recognition to the village, the hunter and Baloo the teacher, this was the book re-created on the big screen. Another essential sequence was the actual fight between Mowgli and Sher Khan which the movie depicted.This tale has been close to my heart since childhood and I really appreciate the maker's efforts of depicting the original version of the story.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

A darker take on the Disney version a few years ago that matches it frame for frame in quality. The CGI is just jaw dropping.

Don't know all the why's & what fors regarding it's non-release & then almost released & then Netflix buying it to have it in limited release & on the network.

114,dtrani,"Dark, Beautiful, and new!",8,15 August 2019,"Andy Serkis' Mowgli is stunning! I knew what I was going to get when I heard that Andy Serkis (worked on projects like The Lord of the Rings and Planet of the Apes) was directing this film. But after watching it immediately after its release date, I was satisfied and very pleased with the outcome.
The film is much darker than Disney's version and feels like a completely different story. The dark feeling is very key and works well, being that it is based in a place where the law of the jungle is prioritized by the animals. The story is very believable with the way Serkis executes his vision and does not ever feel boring or plain.
The only thing that makes the film feel ""unrealistic"" is through their use Motion Capture. I think that the motion capture was a very unique and great feature for the film, which gives it a distinct flavor (also it makes sense, knowing that Serkis is famous for MoCap movies). Through the motion capture, we can both hear and see the actor's performing, which was awesome, in my opinion.
This film is definitely not a Disney movie...and is great because of it. It not only brings something new to the table, but also makes itself memorable and pleasing to the eye. I grew up watching the original Disney classic but would have to honestly say, that I am satisfied with this version more. I am very disappointed to see so many people give this production low ratings because they were expecting song and dance. This was a great movie and I wish it was released in theaters...",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

I would have loved to even watch it on Big Screen, I really wish I could.
Andy Serkis as the director of this film had made it worth waiting for. And the voice cast is so astounding, Christain Bale as bageera, Andy Serkis' Baloo, and luscious voice of Cate Blanchett as Kaa..

This is much closer to the text. Harsh, scary and bloody. With lots of heartbreaking moments. Andy Serkis was behind the wheel, so no surprises. It was going to be difficult to watch in some moments. You can recognize all of the actors by their features and voices. Gollum evolved. Both Favreau's and Serkis' shows are amazing. Using different technologies, approaches and storytelling. Favreau took the Disney way, with amazing twists. Serkis tried to honor Kipling as closely as he could. And, Oh, wow. What a job! I'm 60 and can't stop watching this film.

The characters are much more 'believable' than the ones in Favreau's Jungle Book. Even the wolves and monkeys look like Native to the region that gives it more authenticity.
The film succeeds in building this world in the Jungle and the conflicts surrounding Mowgli. The film fails toward the end where it feels like there were big set-pieces and great moments planned but they seemed very rushed through.

122,criti-cally,Very Good Movie {criti-cally reviews},8,1 February 2019,"The graphics of the movie, although really good and realistic, were not as good as I've seen in others. Maybe they wanted to give it a little fake look so as to not scare the kids away, since the movie is quite dark as it is. Or maybe they were too rushed or ran out of budget. I don't know what exactly happened there, but I was expecting much better CGI and graphics considering the world of advancement we live in. I feel this is one aspect, they could have gotten better. The graphics. Sher Khan seemed very fake and looked more cartoonish than scary to me personally. Dark and good graphics with the dark direction and story line would have done it justice.The movie is a darker version of the Jungle book as we know it. It isn't they typical happy Disney story for kids. This move is for adults no doubt. They have added some very dark and emotional scenes (Bhoot, you little cutie albino wolf). Overall, there were quite a few dark scenes, and that made this movie and its direction more fun and interesting to watch. It gripped me to the end, only reason being its darkness.The young Mowgli's acting was far from phenomenal. Considering how hard it is to act in complete animated movies, the kid acted really good, and was very realistic throughout.
Frieda Pinto, seemed a little plastic/fake and unnecessary here. We had no information about her, as in who she was, why was she taking care of Mowgli. I don't think even her name was mentioned, and was just signed up for this movie for her face, which is fine, but I would have expected slightly more info about her, and more dwelling into her character too. Maybe she lost a child? Or couldn't have one Or was just of a loving nature? Going deeper into her character would draw similarities between a mother's love across all spheres. Whether Nisha (Mowgli's wolf mom) or Frieda (his human god mother), a motherly love is the same amongst all mammals, and seeing this in detail would be an artistic and emotional experience which could be explored a little more.The story has been modified slightly and the characters re-imagined completely (Balloo, what did they do to you, and wtf happened to Louie the monkey?) but I think it was the best to lend to the dark theme of the movie they were trying to create. I overall enjoyed the new character design and the darkness added to them and the story. It was surprising, fresh and matched to the stories tone and easy to associate with.I feel the movie was a little too fast and had more scenes resembling any human in the jungle movie (race / tournament, Meeting elephant, etc.) , rather than introducing some new things. The jungle book has many aspects to focus on, but in this I think the things which were focused were the same contemporary things. But besides this fact, the story was still gripping and exciting to watch. The overall pace of the movie was good and maintained the audiences interest also.This film overall, met my expectations.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

I never knew that Andy Serkis was a director, and this is a very spectacular treat indeed. A heartwarming and adventurous flick with great CGI animation and historical undertones. I liked this way more than any other Jungle Book movie because it was more serious, explored many more things that other adaptations did not and the acting was superb throughout. An all-star cast that is too long to list, but I will say that 14 year old Rohan Chand brought his A game and is a great child actor.

I, Myself have given it a 10 outta 10 and this movie simply left all the memories of the old ""Crappy"" kiddish Mowgli movies behind. Dancing Bears, Giggling wolves and singing monkeys were good and entertaining when we were kids. This movie relates to the jungle stereotype and measures upto the ""Hunt or get hunted"" lifestyles in a dense jungle. I am proud of the #Netflix community that helped make this movie a reality and for basing their trust onto the writers and makers of this movie and giving them a platform to showcase such an amazing movie.
By, the time this movie ended, i wondered why did i like the children's Mowgli-Movies from my past until now. this movie simply replaced all the previous movie-nostalgia i had and yet brought back fond memories of watching it in the earlier days....BRAVO MATE BRRRRRRRRRRAVO........

Instead I watched a movie that was inconsistent. It had some good moments and some boring moments. It never realy impressed me. The animals looked good, but I never really cared for them. When you make a dark movie like this, or any movie for that matter, you need to have characters you care for. Unforutunately I didn't really care if anyone lived it died.

Sounds like the nonsense going on about that white lion that a big game hunter wanted to hunt. People who care this much for animals disgust me.

I don't understand what kind of sick plot twist this is. Doesn't the director realise there are animal loving happy-ending desiring viewers out there? I mean i might expect it if it was some war movie or such like, but its the jungle book. I kind of thought cute innocent animals would be safe. Not happy. I desire a post-credit confirmation that at least it was not Bhoot in the hunter's collection but some other albino wolf. And poor Bhoot's mum who was trying to protect his feelings. I mean sheeesh.

And it was pretty good.Andy Serkis & the writers did a good job portraying the darker tale.The characters too were pretty good,especially Bagheera.Christian Bale absolutely nailed it and he was the biggest plus of the movie.Baloo & Akela too were well developed and animated.I wasnt that convinced with Sherkhan.May be its the impact of Disney's Jungle book,where Sher Khan was more than perfect.The character's CGI,Idris Elba's powerful and majestic voice was unmatchable(sorry Benedict Cumberbatch).I can understand what the makers of Mowgli were trying to do here-showing a more evil and sinistrous Sherkhan in contrast to the fearsome and majestic beast in the Disney version.And Benedict was spot on with what was expected from him.But still it wasnt that convincing.Overall a good movie and definitely worth a watch",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

141,bigblack2009,"CGI, darker themes sever 'Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle' from Disney classic",10,6 December 2018,"Gross, vaguely threatening and surprisingly complex, ""Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle"" is nothing like the Disney film. Directed by Andy Serkis, this modern take on the classic tale ""The Jungle Book"" is dirty, bloody and surprisingly mature for a children's story.The movie opens with a graphic scene showing an abandoned baby boy covered in dirt and alone in the jungle. Then, the humble, but eerily rugged and wild-eyed, panther Bagheera grabs the child and brings him to a family of wild wolves, who take him in and refer to him as a man-cub named Mowgli.The wolves are very kind to Mowgli, but as the boy grows up, he learns the hazards of being a human child among wild animals. He's beaten up, thrown around and faced with bodily harm that is at times hard to watch.Even harder to watch is the intensely detailed animation. The CGI animals in ""Mowgli"" are intricately graphic, and it is clear Serkis sought to make them look wild and dangerous. Baloo the bear, a loving mentor to Mowgli, is nightmare-invoking; he is heavily fanged, very dirty and completely unnerving. His hungry eyes and guttural voice make it difficult to see him for the good guy he is.Baloo's cringe-inducing, overdone appearance doesn't come close to matching that of Shere Khan. He is the tiger who hates humans and is on a mission to destroy Mowgli. He is scarred, walks with a hideous limp and is always followed by a mangy-looking, agitatedly smiling hyena.Along with the dirt, blood and shock, the movie's mature themes make it worthy of its PG-13 rating.There is an unforgettable human complex in this film that pulls it into a new level of understanding. Throughout the movie, Mowgli struggles to find his identity and where he belongs. He's just a boy trying to choose between two families who both need him: his family from the jungle and a human village he grows to love.""Mowgli"" also brings in the idea of man versus nature through the appearance of a British poacher. The animals Mowgli considers family are all in danger of hunting, deforestation and other modern problems. The animals fight for their lives, and they need Mowgli's help.From that conflict comes another theme: nature versus nurture. Mowgli battles with his inherent want to be with his own kind and his loyalty to his jungle family and upbringing as a wild animal. Does he side with the human village or with his jungle family? These are questions that even most adults wouldn't be able to answer in a similar situation, much less a young boy.With its disturbing graphics and overall mature themes, ""Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle"" is not a movie meant for the Disney classic's original audience. This movie took the idea of a children's story and re-envisioned it, gearing it toward more mature viewers. Although the animations were at times difficult to watch, in the end, like a Disney movie, it was heartwarming and satisfying.Bravo Mr Serkis! Well done!",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
142,francescobrosolo,"This ain't your Disney Jungle Book, and that's wild",10,6 December 2018,"In performance-capture maestro Andy Serkis' hands, Legends of the Jungle is a darker, more surprising version of The Jungle Book. Get ready to leave behind the jungle of your childhood imagination. You know, the one where you slumber peacefully in a tree bough, waterfalls ain't nothing but slides and you can float downstream resting on the upturned belly of an amiable bear.It's impossible not to keep comparing Serkis' version of this classic story to Disney's 2016 live-action remake of its own 1967 animated family favorite. In Disney's remake, the animals are remarkably photo-realistic. But Serkis is purposefully trying to achieve something entirely different. The motion capture is used to make the animal characters deeper, richer and almost more recognizably human.This no doubt presents more of a challenge for the actors than straightforward voice work, and as a result the animals are expressive and affecting. They're more well-rounded and relatable than their Disney counterparts, even if they're not as instantly charming. Christian Bale's nuanced performance as Bagheera the panther and Benedict Cumberbatch's ferocity as tiger Shere Khan are standouts that translate particularly powerfully through the performance capture.But as you'll have guessed from the film's title, it's not all about the animals. In Disney's version, Mowgli felt more like a narrative device drawing the animals of the jungle together so we could hear their stories. In Serkis' hands, Mowgli is less of an ensemble player. His character development is central to the plot, especially in the second half. The movie feels like a coming-of-age tale as the man-cub seeks to establish his identity as not quite human, not quite wolf -- simultaneously both and neither.It did come as a surprise when, bang in the middle of the film, the plot veered wildly off course from the familiar narrative the Disney films established atop Kipling's work. Some may hate this startling divergence, but I enjoyed the sudden realization that I didn't know exactly what was going to happen next, especially after being lulled into a false sense of security by familiar opening scenes.Serkis has made a visually arresting film that Netflix is lucky to have gotten its hands on. It has more than the bear necessities required to put it on your watch list, even if it is lacking the music.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

144,mlktrout,"Disney, Shmizny, READ THE FREAKIN' BOOK",4,9 December 2018,"People say this is a decent movie on its own, and it may be, but I have committed the capital offense of actually reading Kipling. Seems like people reviewing Mowgli films these days always compare it to Disney's fun but silly and non-canon cartoon. So I say, hey, for a change, why doesn't somebody--like a film maker--read Kipling's books? There's one out there called ""All the Mowgli Stories"" that collects every story Kipling wrote about Mowgli, and it's alternately pulse-poundingly action-filled, laugh-out-loud funny, and tear-jerking, where's the tissue box emotion-evoking, bloody Kipling got it right.There was no rite of passage called ""The Running.""
Akela, Bagheera, and Baloo NEVER turned on Mowgli.
Mowgli's brothers never called him a FREAK.
There was no runt-of-the-litter-for-pathos' sake Bhoot.
No white hunters lived in Mowgli's village. The only hunter was Buldeo--an Indian.
Shere Khan--a much more interesting cat in the book--was killed by strategy.
Kaa and Mowgli were great friends, and Mowgli would nap in his (KAA was male) coils.I have been watching Mowgli movies and TV series for more than 50 years, and I had such hope for this one. I kept thinking they've done everything BUT the way the stuff was written, surely they'll do it as written now. But no. I've never walked away from a Mowgli movie, no matter how bad, so I kept watching and hoping, but I could never find Kipling's sense of loyalty and fun in it.Back to the drawing board, people.

148,octagonproplex,Legend of the Jumble,5,15 December 2018,"Years ago now, when we learned of two simultaneous rival iterations of Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book being adapted for cinemas - at first blush I was more prone to align my affinities with the grittier more serious Warner Bros approach. Sure, the Disney cartoon from the 60's is a classic - but that's just the thing - it's a classic, it perfectly exist already. However, to tell the story from the point of view of what a boy raised in the jungles of India by wolves, a bear, and a panther would actual be - well that goosed my appetite. Andy Serkis, as a then first time director whom at that point had only previously helmed some second unit for the disappointment that was Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy - well, that wasn't particularly inspiring. Yet I still surmised myself more simpatico with the Warner Bros premise, and on paper felt the voice casting appeared to top Disney's. But then the Disney movie beat WB out of the gate, and set a new bar for photo realistic computer generated animals and environments... oh, and also was completely charming and far more evocative than anticipated. Scrambling to get out from the looming shadow cast in the wake of Disney's massive success, Waner Bros implemented a series of pushbacks, retitles, and rejiggerings. Even so far as bringing in maverick genuis Alfonso Cuaron to ""consult"". Well, Alfonso Cuaron is legitimately one of our finest living filmmakers, so it could only mean Warner Bros was giving all due diligence to make their interpretation as refined and impressive as possible - and genuinely carve out a deeper resonance to transcend the memory of Disney's resent juggernaut... Right? Oh, I wish I could tell you that is what happened. With some slight ceremony, Warner Bros waved the white flag and seemingly surrendered their cinematic aspirations to Netflix. But why? Well, that would answer itself in part as soon as we all got that first trailer glimpse of what two years of extra tender loving care had garnered. Sadly what it seemed to wrought was rot.Warner Bros-cum-Netflix's ""Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle"" is unfortunately pretty inept and inert as far as being a satisfying cinematic experience. Now, I have never read the Rudyard Kipling stories, but I can discern a shoddy showcase when I smell its stench. The one and only element Serkis' tone-deaf attempt did do better than Disney's was the title character (who was indeed presented and acted with more allusion toward psychological depth and nuance). Other than that sole attribute, ""Mowgli"" loses the Jungle Book competition on every conceivable level to the deftness of Disney's concurrent version (for its sense of gracefully inventive hospitality and cohesiveness - its iconography in shot composition and lighting, its editorial flow, its tonal transitions, its scene vignettes, its ingraciating charactizations, its rendering of the animals, and its more resonant musical score).Andy Serkis really doesn't have a great grasp on executing a sound vision, as evidenced by his choices swinging between either oddly offputting or mundanely pedestrian. The direction of the (e)motion-captured animal performances of the actors strangely seems to be aspiring to stage a simultaniously more realistic and cartoonish portrayal, and the inconsistancy of this hodgepodge world-building ends up cannibalizing itself of any credibility in conviction, candor, or cadence. Visually, the computer renderings are seldom convincing to true animals, and Serkis made some extremely poor design decisions from the outset on how he approached the animals by giving them far too much human affectation in body mannerisms and facial appearance. If Serkis never fully appreciated the indelible contribution artistic choices on behalf of directors and animators had aided his previous actorial mo-cap performances - he surely should now, after having revealed his profound lack of understanding in how to properly negotiate the equation. If this was supposed to be Andy Serkis' proof-of-concept to vy for directing an adaptation of George Orwell's ""Animal Farm"" - then it should serve to only take him completely out of the running (get George Miller!).All in all, there was maybe eight salvageable minutes of quality cinematic storytelling in ""Mowgli"" (the running of the wolves/monkey abduction/Bagheera at Mowgli's cage) - whereas Favreau confidently directed the entirety of his Disney extrapolation to thrilling effect.If I wanted a rugged version of The Jungle Book, I would have hired Jean-Jacques Annaud to direct it in the Indian wild with real animals, sans any anthromorphization.I must therefore consider any alleged persons that claim to hold the heinous opinion that Serkis' effort is even halfway adequate, to in fact be Netflix shills or WB stooges. It just simply doesn't pass muster. Not in light of Favreau's achievment with fx house MPC. Not even close.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

152,lunalovitt,"Emotional ride, however...",4,10 December 2018,"This was definitely a darker take of the classic, an angle Serkis was clearly going for. While I appreciate this tone, I am beginning to become disenchanted with the retellings of this story where they always end with Mowgli somehow or another killing Khan by fire or, in this case, knife (much more direct deaths than in the original book where Khan was trampled to death in a stampede). In fact, this movie goes very far out of its way to be dark and emotional to the point of overdoing it. I do not believe I've ever seen an adaptation of the Jungle Book where there was so much wanton death. What's worse is that the deaths were all easily avoidable and were only added in order to create emotional drama to the viewers.The movie opens with an incredibly violent take on Khan's hunting of Mowgli's family. They didn't skimp on the blood with this one. Along the way we run into several animal deaths during hunts and one of the reoccurring themes in the movie is that it is important to watch a creature die so that it soul does not journey on alone. I understand the message, I'm just not certain that it was necessary to view time after time. And of course there's all the dead cows Khan leaves lying about the jungle. Then there were the multiple deaths when Akela was forced to fight his pack for leadership. At least three wolves, presumably some of whom were the pups of Mowgli's adopted mother, are killed without any sort of commentary. I guess we weren't supposed to like them given how often they bullied Mowgli and Bhoot, but still. A little too callously presented.And then we get to the aforementioned Bhoot. It was hinted at in the movie that Bhoot would die. I was prepared for that. However, the way his death was presented was, I believe, meant to come as an emotional shock to the viewer. Serkis excelled in the execution of this and I applaud his ability to lead the audience through this emotional connection to the characters. However, what might leave a bad taste in viewers' mouths is the way Bhoot goes out. His fight with Mowgli is never resolved and his death is used as a plot-driving device to get people to hate the hunter and accept Mowgli's decision to have the man murdered (because, yes, at the end of the day this is what Mowgli does). The narrative surrounding our albino wolf pup was invented solely to be a heart-crushing plot device that ultimately was not needed. I understand the need to be shocking and new to an audience that has probably seen half a dozen JB remakes in their lifetime, but there was little basis for this version other than to manipulate the audience (something, again, which is executed excellently). There is also the point that the hunter himself was not evil. He was not aware that he had killed a thinking animal who was like a brother to Mowgli. He did not understand the connections of the jungle or its laws and people. In fact, he is the potential savior of these people, come to hunt Khan down and protect the village (albeit the light in which he is portrayed switches back and forth all the time). It just so happens that he hunts (and many, MANY people in those times who traveled the world would hunt and bring down trophies and specimens to carry home as part of research and study). At this point in time it's cliche to make the hunter the ""bad guy"" because it's such an overused and ultimately misguided direction to take. The message it sends is that hunters are evil, when in reality the only intentions the man had, as presented by the movie, were good. Sure, he drinks, but drinking and taxidermy do not make the man an evil being deserving to be murdered. And while, yes, he killed Bhoot, he didn't do so maliciously. Maybe if the movie had done a better job of establishing any kind of ill intent by someone other than Mowgli or Khan, I might feel a little better about how the movie ended. Something about this character just didn't click. He wasn't written in a way that was good or bad, yet somehow his actions justified Mowgli trading away his life in order to gain his own revenge. I'm left not liking Mowgli at all. He essentially turns into a revenge killer by the end of the film, much worse than anything the hunter could have been and I think that is the most egregious outcome of the whole Bhoot saga. And of course they end it with the hunter ultimately killing Akela and shooting Mowgli (all on accident too, which is even more perplexing). In no way did this character ever do anything inherently malicious or evil (he was even trying to save Mowgli at the end), yet we are to accept that it's okay what Mowgli ultimately did to him because he's a foreign white hunter who likes to drink. Heck, he is the one who tries to befriend Mowgli and teach him how to live among people. I'm really puzzled at this decision by the writers.Okay, enough about the writing and whatnot. The main reason for my low score simply comes down to the animation. There is no doubt that a lot of talent went into this movie. The director, the actors, the artists. However, the decision to give the animals such human facial features (especially their eyes) was distracting and unnerving (especially at this level of realistic CGI). While most of the effects are beautiful, this humanization was ugly and unappealing. I understand what the creative team was going for, but in the end it fell flat and made all of the animals awkward. It distracted me so badly during the movie that at times I couldn't pay attention to what was going on. Had the animation gone a different direction, I probably would have given this movie a 7/10, but unfortunately this was just one thing I couldn't sit with.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

I think the real reason for the score not being higher is that the main characters are not white, but indianish. And hollywood moviegoers are not too used to seeing indianish main characters. I felt so too at first, but I warmed to it as the story developed and Mowgli began to blossom in the role.The CGI is amazing. Absolutely one of the best CGIs I've ever seen, and I'm a sci-fi fan who has seen a lot. I dont see how some reviewers criticized the CGI. They must have come from the future.

In summary - it feels like an unfinished film, allowing itself to leave you thirsty, to be expected to continue.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

163,lisadewaal-98104,Incredible violence,8,9 December 2018,"If you want to know what kind of movie this is, just look at Baloo's design. Not cuddly. Almost frightening. And that's exactly what this movie is.I'm used to the softer story of Jungle Book, but the truth is that the true story simply isn't soft; this take on the story shows that perfectly well. No silly songs, no goofy character scenes.The downside of this movie is that some characters add almost nothing to the story, and that's kind of sad because they all have so much potential. I like the little twists it has, although at some parts I wish they would grant a little more attention to the violent events that happen. I won't give any examples so I don't spoil it, but maybe you remember a certain moment that left you in shock... and they never speak of that moment again.Overall, pretty good movie. The CGI is cool, the violence is incredible, the characters are better represented than in the Disney versions and the acting is brilliant.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

These animals look too stiff and not very lifelike. The Legend of Tarzan (2016) had the same problem where the CGI just didn't quite cut it compared to the Disney film, although I felt Tarzan's CGI was better than this Jungle Book's.

The CGI was really really bad. The animals looked so.. strange. Balu, Sher Khan, Raksha, all done in such low quality, I mean they could have used The 2016 Jungle Book as a reference but I think egos got in the way and someone thought they did a great job.The story is ok, but the director, cast, VFX crew did not do this any justice, this project should have been cancelled. After reaching the end of the film I noted that Serkis was the director with a cast of Bale, Benedict, Blanchet it just proved that names can not make a film if the overall quality is low.Mark my words, if you have seen Disney's 2016 Jungle Book, this is a cheap chinese bootlegged copy done badly.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

I remember each time I watched it I'd cry at the end wishing he had stayed in the jungle.As an adult I watched the remake again deep down hoping it would change and Mowgli would join the jungle but No!Well 20 plus years and the relief of seeing him walk off and join his real family, happened and yes I cried.This movie is not a remake of Disney's, but a much darker version showing the part of the jungle you don't see, death, blood etc but also managing to capture the fantasy within it aswell. Overall, it is a great addition to The Jungle Book and personally my favourite. Harsh, gritty, sad, exciting and overwhelming CGI. 10/10",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

But thanks to Serkis for not going that way. Every moment I was watching this movie I wanted to sit beside you and hear him explain how he executed each scene. I bet it is starting of new era. Absolutely loved this movie. Warner Brothers clearly being run by some peopt who doesn't understand talent. This movie deserved to be released in theatres in big screen worldwide.

This film just sucks you in as soon as the animals start to speak. The story is amazing. The facial expressions convey so much depth. I was weeping so many times. It gets dark and you care so much for all the characters. The actor who plays Mowgli rips your heart at certain points. Andy Serkis made me love this story. His story.

Mowgli is a more adult oriented film with some dark tones which I appreciate. I was very more focused on the actors. Everyone stands out. Even some actors that have small, but important roles. The CGI was the only thing that got under my skin. Some scenes had excellent visual effects, then exceptional, and then just plain horrible CGI. It feels like an unfinished film and took me away from the movie for a while. Maybe Warner Bros cut the films cost when they decided to go to Netflix. I feel really sorry for Andy Serkis.

189,reeltimeflicks-81729,Great Story; Great Realism; Not Like Disney's Story,8,31 January 2019,"Andy Serkis directs a much darker version of the classic Jungle Book tale. I've read the reviews, and most people rated the movie poorly because they make the mistake of comparing this film to Disney's that came out 2 years prior. The source material may be the same but story is certainly unique, and as such should not be compared. Several scenes unabashedly show blood and violence between the characters and Mowgli himself gets cut quite a few times, and story isn't afraid of killing off some lovable characters. This version of the story might be more of what you might expect from a story about a boy in a jungle who can talk to animals. Aside from the truly marvelous CGI and visceral cinematography, the best part of this movie is seeing the animals turn almost human with their emotions and mannerisms. The way the motion-capture CGI has worked, you might even see a human face or two among the creatures that are usually portrayed as wild and vicious. Certainly, the movie rating should be adhered by responsible parents, but any kids mature enough to watch the film, as well as adults, will be treated to a coming-of-age story rooted in realism but at the same time not losing the core themes of freedom and necessity--a must watch for jungle lovers and adventure lovers alike.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

Mowgli faces real challenges, real situation and risks death many times. The characterization of the animals is so great that they sound human (although we are not a good reference for this planet, we're destroying it completely).

196,lastReq,About THE dark twist...,10,6 January 2019,"Im a 47 year old man and I found Bhoots re-appearance at the hunter lodge deeply upsetting, I'm not sure what a child would make of this... As an adult film which I wasnt sure it was as I watched it and enjoying it for what it was, that scene jolted me into another movie entirely...
The characters were grittier especially baloo and the opening scene where the Tiger attacks left the actual kills off scene so I was lulled into a false sense of what the movie was...
Bhoots reappearance is a major shock... I think now that its made all the more shocking because in the movie the jungle is set as a place of natural law where you have to kill too survive but theres no enjoyment in the act of killing for the sake of it (with the notable exception of shere khan)
So to be confronted by the killing of Bhoot a harmless animal for nothing more than a keepsake is completely alien to the whole fims ethos and how your confonted by his smiling head is so damn shocking ,even if you were a hunter you'd find the experience unerving... The Hunter isnt portrayed as an evil man and nor is he but what he suffers from as mankind suffers from is an inate right to treat all of nature as his too do with what he wants... to take trophys for the sake of it which when viewed from the natural law of the jungle is heinous

Skip it.,3,11 December 2018,"It humanizes animals in ways too absurd, they cry, they smile, they get sad, they have laws and rules, the level of unrealism is unnecessary and rather shameful. Especially because the target demographic is still learning about the ways of life, and it could be said that by watching this piece they would actually learn it the wrong way. So from a parent POV it's a disservice. Plus, it's a fantasy too unreal for a human adult to be entertained and appreciate it. It has multiple conflicts of storytelling within itself, for example only select animals are humanized, others aren't, so what's up with that? I hate movies that pretend the viewer isn't clever enough to ask relevant questions that convey the narrative, since they pretend the questions don't exist, that means they never bother to answer them. The dialogues are full of emotional appealing tries, but it ends up just being vague and empty phrases that cannot conceive thruthfulness because it's too disconnected from reality. The OST isn't remarkable, nothing to be remembered of. I can easily say skip this one if you're older than 8.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

Very strange. Also, all of the jungle animals have british and scottish accents... quite stupid choice for voices. Wouldn't making all of them have Indian accents make a lot more sense?Also, how does it make sense that the Indian people would call in a white colonist to kill a tiger for them?

208,hayovanderwolk,Somebody give Andy Serkis an Oscar already,8,11 December 2018,"When i first heard the news about this movie i was like: what?, another? But i did my research and found out this was going to be different then the other versions and actually like the book, also it that is was going to be directed and partially acted by Andy Serkis. Then it got my attention. But i never expected it to be this good. I never expected i would even dare to say this because i grew up with the Disney version of the jungle book but, THIS IS THE BEST JUNGLE BOOK MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN.Lets break it down.
This movie truly got to me. It was unexpetedly emotional, and dark. I expeted it to be moving but in a different way. I thought it would bring me back to my old memories of when i was a little kid (i'm 19 now so i'm stil kind of a kid but ok, haha), but it was different. It did remind me of the old days but mixed with more realism in the form of introducing dark tones and dilemma's + pains and struggles we all have to deal with in real life. Ofcourse it is not realistic because it has talking animals. I know that. But believe me this movie is deeper and has more hidden meaning then you might think. The titel 'Mowgli' is perfect and i will explain why. The scene that Mowgli and Bhoot meet up after Mowgli lost the running test, Mowgli lets it all out at Bhoot. Saying he is lied to by his parents that his special just because he is actually not fitting the image of a real wolf. It's very relatable to society nowadays were social media is the big influencer of life and we all let other people tell us who we are and if we are good enough or not. It was heartbreaking to see Bhoot was killed by the hunter but it was nessecary to let Mowgli have an character development. This is the moment he realises even the humans are not perfect and also are just as dangerous as Sher Khan even though Bhageera told him he was save there. This movie is all about Mowgli's search for himself and a loving home. He is being torn apart by what he wants. Does he stay in the Jungle? because thats where he grew up. Or does he stay with the humans where he had to flee to?, because they actually are not that bad as he thought. Maybe the Disney version has this aswell but the child playing mowgli in those movies can not deliver this feeling as wel as the kid from this movie. And Disney is not a studio that likes to focus on bad things of life too much in their movies. Because they want children to enjoy it too so they can make more money off of it. And again, i am someone who grew up with Disney, but this movie is again a reminder of what studio's like Disney actually are like. But lets get back to the movie.
I actually liked the ending as well beacause they really killed the tiger instead of leaving the kill out of screen so he could maybe return (if box office is good). The kid who plays Mowgli is phenomenal, he does an amazing job. Also i was really surprised to say this but Benedict Cumberbatch's version of Sher Khan is just as good as Idris Elba's one (even though i was sceptical about the whole weird half broken paw thing going on). Also the rest of the cast like Christian Bale and Cate Blanchett deserve to be mentioned for there performance.The only things i didn't like were the scene where the hunter somehow doesn't hear the giant elephant that is running towards him. And the visuals were 80% of the times amazing but some times mediocore.I would give it an 8,6 but i can only give whole numbers so i make it an 8",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

211,icwhite,The Best Adaption of Rudyard Kipling's Legend,10,8 December 2018,"So far this is my favorite adaption of The Jungle Book, has a lot of elements from the source material and stunning visuals from Andy Serkis. Felt a lot of emotions from the animals, which is why the motion capture visuals were so convincing. Without Andy, we wouldn't have motion capture at all. He made such a huge impact on film visual effects, love the guy's work. I also like the fact that Mowgli had a lot complexion with who he is and how he fits in with the jungle. The script was very put together very well and was pretty close to the source material. I do like Jon Faveru's version as well, but it was a remake of the Disney animated film that had some Kipling in it and this film over tops it . Overall, this film is a masterpiece.

The animals really come across as 'people' and the kid who plays Mowgli is fantastic. Phenomenal casting job there. I think that visually it works pretty well and the jungle feels like an immersive, slightly magical place.Storywise, again the character work is the star. There are some incredibly moving, even heartbreakingly sad scenes, and overall it's a story about values and identity. So that's cool. I'm not sure I'd say that the film sticks the landing, because the ending feels kind of abbreviated to me. That's why I didn't give it a really high grade, but I would certainly recommend it.

I'm not sure why they happen, and the characters don't seem to be sure why things happen, but they happen, and they somehow make a story. Characters act out of character in a way that detaches me from the story and just in general the plotline has a very strange pace that never really keeps me interested. A lot of 'emotional' scenes seem kind of forced due to how out-of-character the build up was, though some emotional scenes still manage to be great. In particular I feel like the story spends a lot more attention towards building its characters than Disney ever did. This film spends a lot of time emphasizing the relationships between Mowgli and the other characters as well as the characters with each other; every character feels alive and unique with brilliantly-animated emotional depth. Ironically though I feel like Mowgli is the one lacking the most depth, and he just kinda does things, and I am almost constantly confused as to why he is doing anything. He's implied to be a great hero but to me he appears much more like a fool being a fool, except it somehow works out in the end and everyone else goes along with it; there are several times where he does something and the entire time I am thinking ""no, you absolute garbage boy, why are you doing that."" The same applies to Shere Khan, who often just appears, and I'm never sure why he's there, or how he's there, or what he's doing or why he's doing it, but he's there and he does what he does. Aside from that, I also feel like the world itself is much more alive than the Disney interpretations. You really see a lot of the culture and traditions, in both the animals and humans, in ways that are both darker, brighter, and more lively than Disney, though I just feel like these things are roughly put together in a choppy disorganized plot. There are several scenes where I feel like the writers didn't actually know where to put the scene, they just wanted it in the movie somewhere, and so they haphazardly shoved it in.In all I'd say it's another iconic example of a movie with a teaser trailer that is much better than the actual end result, but I guess I'd recommend it if you're as easily amused by CG animals as I am.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
216,joeytosi,Best version of this classic tale so far!,10,10 December 2018,"I have enjoyed all of the versions of this story. This version, however, is outstanding. The CGI is a little on the rough side, but the story more than makes up for it. No cute songs, just great directing, filmmaking, and storytelling. Great job Andy Serkis and Netflix! (My 10 star rating is based on versions of the Jungle Book, not on all movies ever made.)",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

218,matrixdukenukem000,Closer to book and inspired from the inspiration of the book.,10,11 December 2018,"Okay so, Rudyard Kipling did not sit at edge of the forest and thought oh let me write a story about jungle. His book was based on a real man raised in jungle.Second thing you don't know is production of this movie started before Disney live action. You're the reason capitalist bullies like Disney win.Few things this movie did that Disney adaptation (both) did not even come close to.1. Rescue and adoption of Mowgli by Bagheera and wold pack.
2. Mowgli's training and bond with his pack. Although I liked the motherly bond of Raksha in Favreau version better.
3. Mowgli's encounter with Kaa. The cinematography is astounding and the whole sequence is masterfully done.
4. Action and animal behavior. Yes. As far as realism goes for a movie with talking animals, this movie wins. The argument between Baloo and Bagheera is one of the best scenes in the movie. The way monkeys handle Mowgli in kidnapping is exactly how it would happen. He wouldn't be Mysa-ed to their boss.
5. Capturing Indian essence. The human side of Mowgli, although small was done tastefully.
6. Let's be honest, performance wise, this child actor was leagues ahead of Favreau 's.People are giving this bad rating because they killed off a character and because omg SURPRISE... man is the villain here. Man has always been the villain when nature and animals are in question. Sport hunting is evil, and that's the message of this movie made clear in the very beginning.Now, Disney jungle book is its own genre. If you wanna go for a sing along hunky dory version of this story. Go watch Disney. I hope they trample mufasa so bad you all need therapy after that.If you prefer dark theme and a fresh take on an old classic. This one is 10/10 winner.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

The vocal talent is impressive and the likes of Cumberbatch and Bale certainly do deliver, but Mowgli is a major let down with his abysmal acting - I think they could have done a better job at casting here.

So for everyone that was expecting another Disney version, go watch the jungle book, not MOWGLI. I'm giving this a 10/10 simply to make up for all the reviews that were bad.

CGI is really a thing which made me dislike the movie, is so bizarre. Human faces in animals body, pretty scary sometimes. In 2016 was like real animals with the max emotions a animal can do.
I like how Mowgli ""encounter"" the humans and try to be part of them. It's so poor the relation of him with Raksha and the pack of wolves that his new relation to the woman who cared him is more deeply.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
226,gnewton1968,"Dark, Disturbing, and NOT Disney",10,31 December 2018,"I've never written a review before. But I felt like I needed to write one for this movie because of all of the bad reviews based on Bhoot. I too was shocked and disturbed when bhoot was killed. Oddly, looking back, I wasn't nearly as disturbed when Mowgli's parents were killed. Wonder why that is?I think there's a point that was trying to be made in this movie. That is when evil is allowed to continue, innocent people die. Mowgli's parents were innocent. Bhoot was innocent.What I think some people have missed is that Shere Khan and the hunter are basically the same character. So filled with evil and the thrill of the kill that they don't care about law (of man or of the jungle). The only answer for evil, is for it to be overcome by good. Which is what happened in this movie. The evil was eliminated by good.You cannot appreciate the elimination of evil, until you see exactly how evil it is. The Hunter's death would have seemed odd and out of place if he hadn't killed Bhoot. He was evil. Shere Khan was evil. That was the point. Was it difficult to watch? Yes! Was is a good movie? Yes! But it is definitely not a Disney movie and I would not recommend it for young children.The only negative I have is the narration done by Kaa (Cate Blanchett) was over dramatic. Other than that, I I thought it was very well done.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

Strangely some CGI is extremely impressive starting with Baloo, on the other hand some characters were like overlays in real environments.

233,kashmirlayla,The Jungle Book for the Anthropocene Age,9,8 December 2018,"Reading the reviews, I did not expect a serious film. But we love the story, so we put it on anyways. Halfway through, we turn to each other, having realized that it was amazing! Much more interesting take on the material than any of the previous iterations: instead of a goofy sing-a-long with some cool visuals, the film turns out to be a veritable meditation on the fragile barrier between the natural world and the human world, and the turmoil that results when that boundary is broken. Our hero Mowgli is the wild boy caught between the two.Chaos from the tumultuous modern world has spilled over into the 'jungle,' a savage but ordered environment whose 'law' is destabilized by man's transgressions. Shere Khan the tiger has killed two humans, Mowgli's parents, leaving the orphan child in the jungle. Mowgli is found and cared for by Akera the wolf; however, the continued presence in the jungle of a human defies its fragile stability.Against this backdrop Serkin really immerses you in this universe, which is notably much more complex and fleshed-out than that of previous versions. Hints of colonialism and modernization throw new light on the sources of upheaval in the jungle. In the end, we are left to think about Mowgli's position, navigating between men and nature, and his role in finding a new way for them to coexist. In order to make peace between two domains, one must understand both.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

238,ymandayawon,Based on Kipling's Novel and not Disney's,9,18 January 2019,"Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle is directed by Andy Serkis in his longtime passion project and stars Rohan Chand as the titular character with Christian Bale, Benedict Cumberbatch, Cate Blanchett, Peter Mullan, Matthew Rhys, and Andy Serkis. It tells the story of Mowgli as he was taken care of by a pack of wolves led by Akeela (Mullan) along with Bagheera (Bale) and Baloo (Serkis) after Shere Khan (Cumberbatch) kills his parents and begins to question his own place in the jungle.Mowgli is a dark take on the Disney adaptation we know and love and tells the story based on Kipling's original work. Andy Serkis has done a great job directing this film and the CGI and the motion capture played and voiced by the cast is exquisite. It tells a realistic story about a boy raised by animals and questions his own place and tries to find himself in the jungle and in the man village while being hunted by the tiger, Shere Khan. It portrays Mowgli as vulnerable, dirty and most of all, believable. Not just him, but the others as well. We care about them as know certain things about each character and the relationships each of them build. The performances are top notch especially by Chand, being a child actor in a dark film. As for the story, there are certain aspects that are too dark but deem necessary to portray realism of the harsh interactions between both animals and humans. Mowgli in the middle, begins to understand and is torn apart from his place in the world, a decision Disney failed to tackle.The CGI used for the animals and the setting is really good though not as good as the Disney version consider the difference of the budget. Though there are some scenes where you can tell it's animated, overall it's still believable with the facial expressions and body language the cast depicted.Reviewing this film, it is hard not to compare this with the 2016 and animated Disney version. Both are great films, in my opinion. But if you want a more grounded and realistic take on the story, I suggest Mowgli as the upper hand. Whereas the Disney's version is more family friendly than this one.-Yman Dayawon",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

Stop ruining our good memories of our childhood animations, be creative and start new stories. Remaking usually end up a disaster like this.
By the way, sound and characters are awfully selected and are not match.

When it came to Netflix, i put it on, and after finishing the film, I instantly regretted it. This film had real potential, but it was all squandered first up, the visuals. The animals looked awkward at best and disturbing at worst. Bagheera looked creepy, and Shere Khan looked so ridiculous that I actually laughed at him. Jon Favreau's Jungle book did better with its visuals, because the characters looked like real animals. On a positive note, some of the acting was okay, particularly Cate Blanchett as Kaa. The plot, however, was an absolute mess. The narrative didn't flow well at all, and there were multiple plot holes. There was little to no character development. We were supposed to feel sad when Mowgli's albino wolf friend dies, but, we barely got to know him as a character. Also, the film was WAY too dark. Again, Jon Favreau did it better because it had a better balance between light hearted and dark. This does not. Seriously, Watership Down is Care Bears compared to this. So, in short, just stick to Jon Favreau's Jungle Book, and skip this one.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

It contains some pretty gruesome imagery that may be inappropriate for young children. Including, but not limited to; a baby covered in parents blood, and a wolf puppy's severed head. The animation is Ok, but the character design is creapy. They are disproportionate, have gritty features, and wide set eyes. They look like human animal hybrid experiments. Overall it seemed like a low budget movie, no sub plots, lazy cinematography, and no character development.

In this movie Shere Khan has similar facial expressions as the wolf from «The Neverending Story», and all the animals looks kinda creepy.This movie is supposedly more accurate to the book, while Disney's versions are more light and fun, and less accurate to the book.

In one scene with Shere Kaan I'm not sure he is talking to a monkey or a hyena.

Frankly, I have been disappointed with the direction that children's animated features have taken in recent years: they've become too silly, noisy, frenetic, bumptious, slangy, sarcastic... and totally devoid of REAL intimacy, tenderness and emotion.... of the kind that Disney films used to have in the 1930's, 40's and 50's.But I am stunned by this film. So visually beautiful, gorgeous sound design. Stunningly detailed sets, and you will be hard-pressed to imagine where the live action ends... and the CGI begins. And the Mo-Cap animation is just blowing me away: They really have invested these animal characters with heartbreakingly honest and beautiful emotion, of a kind I have never seen before. I literally cannot examine these animated animal faces... without tearing up. This is real art, real care, real subtlety. In short, they've managed to traverse the ""uncanny valley"", and produce animated characters whose emotions are dazzlingly realistic, immensely subtle, detailed and affecting. At age 55, I am watching this thing with the openhearted, surrendered trust of a 6-year-old... because the animators have earned that from me.One of the best family-oriented films of the Millennium, no question.

261,kylevan-76991,Mowgli: Legend Of The Jungle,10,8 December 2018,"Mowgli has a huge powerful thought provoking premise. So the story/plot is going to be BIG, and it is.
This movie tells us the definition of dark and serious, and it works! The film is so serious, it grabs you with all of it's might & will never let go!
Suprisingly enough, the story/plot is easy to follow, & yet, it can also be unpredictable, & the film stay's true to kipling's classic books.
Since it is an Andy Serkis film, it has a hybrid motion capture animation & realistic CGI, & the character models are just great, the cgi is Andy's version of jungle book characters. Everything about the entire cast is flawless. Christian Bale is perfect for Bagheera: gentle, beautiful, & strong. The cast for the wolves are perfect. Cate Blanchett's voice is pitch-perfect for a female python. Benedict Cumberbatch's voice is pitch-perfect for a tiger, & somtimes has a vicious thundering growling vibe to his voice for shere khan & it works. Andy Serkis himself did a splendid job playing Baloo, & has a booming powerful bear-like voice for the role. And of course: Rohan Chand played Mowgli & did a top-notch job!
The voice-acting from the creature characters & the acting from the human characters are brilliantly directed & feel real.The dialogue/script is deep, and was written with brains and brawn. It also a lot of scenes where it has the best direction, editing, and screenplay.
It has great camera work (great sweeping cinematography, the direction of the camera focus with the foreground and the background, & sometimes into the characters eyes). Nitin Sawhney's music is super serious, has emotion, & has a lot of gravity during the action sequences. The music also fits perfectly for the film.The villians of the film (Shere Khan & the Man) causes terror and hatred. Everytime shere khan is on screen, he makes the viewer nervous and will frighten you, the hunter/man/poacher is somthing in this world that should never ever exist on earth & causes fear & hatred not only towards the animals, but also the the humans. The final fight scene feels like war, & the way it started with the confrontation of mowgli and shere khan is just ""BOOM!"" It's on!The ending of the movie is powerful, satisfying, & heart warming.Overall: this film has to be the best ""jungle book"" film that it could be.

263,pkb369,Only 1 thing missing,8,10 December 2018,"Personally loved the adaptation.Only thing I thought that might have been better is (spoiler) a (or the scene) that show cased mowgli's presence in the jungle to the humans at the end, either when he was fighting khan (this did show some of it, but they could have done this abit better) or after or even a side scene showing mowgli 'protecting' or guarding the pack/jungle against the humans.I was expecting it and expecting it but was disappointed when it didnt come (I'm used to eiichiro oda style of story telling of epic scenes :x).",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
264,matsteman,Too mature for young children. Too bland for adults.,5,9 December 2018,"Call me basic, but I prefer animated animal films to feel magical and positive. Mowgli is dark and depressing, and the ending left me feeling low. A movie like this should be FUN (such as Disney's version). This movie is not. That one shocking moment (you'll know it if you've seen it) is too much for this type of movie. It's not that I don't think kids' movies shouldn't be sad or dark, but this was over the top.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
265,vato786-78-328820,A tad disappointed....,6,11 December 2018,"... Was expecting more depth and grain.
Visually - not half bad, but in my opinion it lacks character and overall charisma of the original story by Kipling. Felt too simplified and shallow. Where is the everlasting clash between good evil, kindness and avarice, humanity and malignancy, love and hate? I personally like the ""The Jungle Book"" with Sabu (1942 by Zoltan Korda) much more.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

268,ed755,Rohan Chand cant act,6,8 December 2018,The boy really is an awful actor. Its a shame considering the expensive actors they have used for voiceovers and the impressive CGI which must have cost a lot.

270,shovonali,The Jungle Book was better,6,18 February 2021,"The story was average. Acting of the lead actor was incredible. But everything else in it seemed artificial right from the beginning. The expressions of the animals were made conspicuously human. Animals making such eye brow movements seems ridiculous. Albeit, it's a a human narration under the guise of animals but there outward appearance/expressions should resemble more like animals. Let's not forget the fact that here the humans are trying to emote animal instincts and not the other way round.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
271,michaelrhuston,Better than junglebook,8,9 December 2018,I loved this movie. I was happy to see that it was not a repeat of jungle book. It was definitely well acted and thought out. I was expecting it to be kid like which it is not. That being said I'd let my older kids watch this movie but probably not my youngest. The storyline was easy to follow and it kept me interested in many ways.,Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
272,minis-78130,Amazing movie,10,8 December 2018,I was really disappointed when I saw The Jungle Book remake in 2016. But this remake was so great and really special and I loved it. It was like no other movie and you even forgot it was based on the original movie. I also liked the maincharacter very much and the story became more real and serious by having good actors and many moments where you got to feel the real struggles of surviving in the jungle. The movie was also very well done and the jungle was really cool.,Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

274,djevinrude,The Best Jungle Book Yet,10,11 December 2018,"Purely and simply, this is my favorite adaptation of the classic Kipling tale that's been made to date. Beautiful, gripping, intense, and darker and more serious than the others. Incredible animals, animation, scenery, visual effects, audio effects, soundscapes, and of course, voices.And though I'm here comparing it to the others, I think I enjoyed it so much because I didn't think about what they did differently, or if the story is true to form, while watching it. I just took it for what it was, immersed my mind into the story, let it flow, and loved every moment of it. It was only afterwards, noticing how I felt in the wake of the film, that I thought, with a warm feeling and a big smile, ""Wow. That's my favorite Jungle Book yet.""",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

276,RamonaBlu,Loved it & I'm 50 (maybe 51-lol),10,15 December 2018,"I loathe aging and used to not fathom how some adults around me would do a banter back and forth mentally about what is their real age. How could one forget that! Its not like the numbers Will likely exceed two digits - LOL. Anyway, that is me now, but I find I enjoy many of my childhood story re-does, some like this which done remove the elements which made the story, originally, more childlike... say animation, singing, etc.Although it can simply be a dud itself and missing those, sometimes very prominent, elements not stand as strong as a story itself. I loved the Jungle Book as a kid and Although I did miss the sing-alongness of the songs sung by Baloo and that (plus the nuttiness) of the Monkey King utty Monkey King, but I got way into it on its own. It just made me want to go back to rewatch TJB (& Rikki-Tikki-Tavi); pls forgive all the character misspellings, I wrote this from the heart and memory;)Reimaginings done this way are partly for a good reason - it brings another perspective to a beloved tale, using the most current digital technology - a feat which more recent generations often expect, and no wonder - its amazing. They could just as easily have remade it live action-ish with the extra-silliness and the cool songs.... another time though.The kid was a pleasure to watch, compelling, and interesting most especially realizing he acted by himself, appropriately emotionally capturing the scenes and it all felt pretty seamless to me. The kid's perfmance is what allowed me to get into it, especially since Shera Khan looked like he had a bad eye brow lift... most characters did not distract however.... were cute and/or realistic, and/or animatronic-like enough to not focus on them beyond the story. That little best friend white albino wolf-cub, whoever voiced them, gosh he looked & sounded just so adorbubble!!! Touching scenes with, and later about him.
I know the script had some oddities and it's all certainly a fantasy film, leaving many ""real-living in such a situation"" questions, but I can't knock them for not explaining much on food, pants, potty-time, understanding each other, but in truth - I have many of these questions (especially about hygeine) in tons of non-family films, say superheros, walking dead characters. Don't both get itches (tight clothes, being ubwashed respectively? ON & ON, say does batman have fabreeze? What do zombie killers use for TP out in the never-ending walk-about of Atl+?I absolutely loved Mowgli and will watch it again with me equally elderly husband-lol. I hope that there is a Mowgli2 and regardless of past material I may not recall, there are many elements we would expect Mowgli's story to take, and I hope they do it (before the good little actor in it grows up too big). All sorts of the questions we may have could be touched on, but most importantly is how he must bond and breed human. Perhaps Mowgli 2 could help him can blend the pass on the best of himself to future animal leaders, while he, perhaps does some kind of ""out of africas-ish lifestyle"", lives with his growing human family on the outskirts of his jungle home, blending both worlds and learning & sharing on both sides. The kid was really great and after finishing this novella, I'll figure out his name and tag him to watch other work, but one more mention of how compelling I thought he was (scene-appropriate throughout) during an especially emotional scene in the hunters tent... I had to catch my breath on both the tragedy and how the actor's little face scrunched up and cried so much I could feel the tenseness in his curling lips-just like anyone so young (or maybe old) being so unexpectedly struck with sadness.Sorry to drag on, likely only to my future rereading self (lol), but the hunter's casting was not ideal in my opinion. I love that dude from the Americans and just don't think some of the smaller character actorish roles I've seen him in do him, or the piece, justice (that omnipresent recebt Bradely Cooper chef movie and this). I think maybe that actor is best given a more fully formed character and able to delve into it, so we can see and appreciate his breadth. My opnion anyway, but in this he seemed not to make the impact I think the story was wanting-us to pretty much purely hate him and the only time this was questionable, was the beggininh of his time with Mowgli - and I believe we were meant to realize that we had only misunderstood any seeming kindness shown. No real complexity-just a selfish/tropy-killer & a drunken fool, but we should not have been left with any sympaythy in tbe story, simple as told.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

278,jimthething,Can't recommend this movie highly enough,10,8 December 2018,"I really enjoyed the recent Disney version of The Jungle Book, and I thought it would take some beating.
This version, which is more a collection of Kipling's Mowgli tales is darker, more in the spirit of the original stories, and, for me, the better movie.
I've rarely rated anything 10/10 because I believe there's always room for improvement. With Mowgli though, I don't think it could have been done better.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

Disneys original story was far more touching and lots of great humor also.
This story has zero. Sorry to say.
This movie could probably had taken home some prices if Baloo had stand up and started singing his famous song but he only looks angry and stupid . Lots and lots of talking and not a single tone. (except for the baground musac)

When they released the trailer I thought why the hell would you wanna make same movie which was just released a year ago. But I was wrong the way the story is presented is different, darker and it is shown from the perspective of the lead character mogli. It's good that they had local language when the village people are speaking, keept it very real. And I should mention the kid he was just amazing with the expressions specially when it comes to emotional scenes.I throughly enjoyed the movie.

You really felt the darkness and the grime of it. But the last 15 minutes ruined the movie completely. It was just anti climatic and kind of stupid. Whoever wrote the ending really messed up a great movie. It wasn't the result that was bad. It was just how it was done. Not great at all.,Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
286,macoz,Don't watch if you have trouble watching animals get killed.,6,28 December 2018,"This is ultimately a coming of age story written with teens in mind.The story is too complex for its own good. It tries to criticize mankinds effect on nature, but it comes off about as subtle as a sledgehammer. It also has pacing issues. It tries to do too much and as a result never takes the time needed for the scenes to have the impact they require, the movie just skips along to the next scene. It can be very jarring at times. Add to that a soundtrack about as subtle as the aforementioned critique of mankind and you've got one obnoxious piece of preachy cinema.The story is also too dark for my tastes. One character in particular suffers a very gnarly death which seems to be there more to make a statement, and less to serve the story. It never gets a satisfying resolution, and left me feeling down the rest of the evening. It also spurred me to write this review, so I guess it was effective as these stort of things go, but still an unwelcome affair.Although the cimatography is very good, the CGI is shaky, with some great characters looking great, some characters looking wonky, and some characters looking great and then looking wonky. This is likely a matter of budget, so I try not to hold that against it. That said - whoever thought ""let's make a movie that relies heavily on CGI and then skimp on the CGI parts"" was a good idea should cease thinking.The actor who plays Mowgli is also very incoistent with his acting. This is understandable given his age, and the difficulty of acting opposite characters that have yet to be rendered, but is still an overall detriment to the movie. The voicework, on the other hand, is excellent throughout. Bageera, and Kaa in particular were fantastic.All in all, the movie is fine, but I would not have seen it had I known beforehand how dark it was.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
287,tm-juli,"When ""Darker Spin"" means ""Make Baloo the most terrifying thing you've seen 2018. The year where Hereditary was released.""",2,11 December 2018,"I don't know what it is these days, but to think gritty equals better, certainly doesn't take the right lesson away from ""The Dark Knight"".
The whole selling point (before they realized that noone would spent another 15 Dollars on a Jungle Book Adaptation two years after the great Remake from Disney and sold this atrocity to Netflix) was that ""Mowgli - Legend Of Tue Jungle"" would be darker than all the other Jungle Book Movies. Despite that nobody asked for that, ""darker"" doesn't mean that everybody is a mean a-hole and every character is f@#$ing terrifying to look at.
I don't know the book, as most People don't, so the common perception of Baloo is that of a laidback, chill and very empathetic bear. Here Baloo is ""gritty""/""edgy"" as hell. He looks creepy like no other character in the whole movie. Is mean, loud, british, has scars and blood on his face. The realtionship between him and Mowgli seems to be motivated by fear instead of empathy. That's what I was missing in the other adaptations.
Almost every animals looks unrealistic. Not that the animation is bad, but it just isn't good enough. Its terrifying to look at. Bagheera is the only one that made me go ""that looks pretty good"".
Shere-Khan looks ridiculous. His eyes are too far on the outside of his small head, but he is the only character besides Bagheera who isn't full-on Nightmare-Fuel.
Mowgli... what a f-ing a-hole. He is mean-spirited. Thinks he's better than everyone else and is a brutal Killer himself. He doesn't really learn to be a better self. He kills the one with very valid points why Mowgli shouldn't be in the Jungle, Shere-Khan. And lets the man who hunts the same Tiger be killed for being a killer. Well, I guess he was mad at the hunter for killing his albino-friend which Mowgli pushed away in a moment of self-loathing. What a prick.
I like Andy Serkis and most of The Stuff he makes, but ""Mowgli"" made me angry. Not because it destroyed and betrayed characters that are loveable and iconic, but because it is such a wrong way to think about stories. ""Make everything darker than it will be better."" In a time where pessimism lurks behind every corner, this movie sends the wrong messages. It is a negative downer-experience with unlikeable characters and terrifying animation. Unlike the inspiring animated classic, nobody will have a good time and it will do no good for anyone. Dark in all the wrong places!",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

300,vartulgm,Will put Indian daily Soap Opera to Shame!!,3,2 January 2019,"I was hyped about this movie by reading all the great comments and reviews on media. Below is my review in points -Good:
VFX Effects.Bad:
-Nostril flaring disguised as 'acting', by Mowgli.
-From the hood accent of baloo. Also, Baloo shown as 104 years old.
-Mowgli constantly falling and landing on his face from towering heights, with not even a scratch(just a growl).
-Events happening incoherently.
Characters traversing jungle at the speed of light.Apparently Fire is immune to water in Director's universe.-A world class hunter cannot observe an elephant sprinting towards him.
Ending(specifically scene of killing sher Khan)Overall:
One more milking of a good movie/storyline till the last dime it's worth(read Transformer & Hangover). The movie did not even come close to all the hype created and dishonour the original classic. Lastly, my respect to the marketing team; you got me.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
301,benv-89995,"Better than you think. If you got Netflix, WATCH NOW!",7,22 December 2018,"""Mowgli: Legend Of The Jungle Book"" on Netflix has attracted negativity due to its pulled cinematic release and frankly poor marketing for the most part. However, despite beginning if some questionable CGI, the film continues and progressively gets better in visuals and narrative. The acting is great (e.g. Andy Serkis as Baloo, visuals for the animals is just as good as the 2016 film, and the story just as compelling and distinct in its own right. What being have been saying about not being ""Disney Jungle Book"" is completely valid. The film is much darker, with the opening scene having a baby covered in blood (But not too much)! This will likely be jarring for those who loved the original Disney animation and 2016 film, however if you simply focus on the film in front of you, the tale is great and the darker tone makes sense, unlike shows or movies with darker tones just to be ""edgy"". Other than that, it focuses more on humanity, which led to some great explorations of themes, like belonging, in relation to Mowgli's character. HOWEVER, the main problem with the film, though, derives from the films timing: If you have not seen the 2016 film, this movie will be GREAT and definitely attract others to Netflix. But if you have seen that 2016 film, audiences will constantly be comparing the films in there head and everything ""Mowgli"" does great, e.g. acting and special effects, the 2016 film does great also. This will likely mean ""Mowgli"" will be lost in people's minds as the thought that they saw just ""another Jungle Book movie"" will make ""Mowgli"" get lost in the crowd. However, if you put ALL this aside, ""Mowgli"" is JUST AS GOOD as the 2016 film, and is truly a surprise as someone going in with low expectations. So, if you have Netflix and have not watched the 2016, it is highly recommended. If you have watched the 2016 film and get put that out of your mind, it will truly be worth the watch.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
302,candymanbmf,Some of the worst acting I've ever seen,5,22 December 2018,"Going into this one I had no idea what to expect. I mean sure, everyone knows about the jungle book story and its catchy tunes, so maybe I was expecting a better, well polished, CGI rich remake of the old classic. That being said, the movie managed to surprise me from the very first scenes...and not necessarily in a good way.
It's not as much about the realism or the raw nature of the story's interpretation, but there are mainly two reasons that I disliked it:
First, it's the very poor acting skills of the young actor portraying Mowgli. We're mostly talking about ridiculously overacted facial expressions, to the point of becoming grotesque and distracting from the actual events that are unfolding.
Secondly, although I didn't mind the dark, Tim Burtonesque vibe of the story and characters, I didn't really see a point in portraying Baloo as a decrepit, mangy, almost diseased-looking and borderline deranged bear. Of course he didn't have to look like a fluffy, coddling teddy bear, but com'on!
Anyway, I wouldn't say this movie is a waste of your time. The CGI is pretty good and, all in all, it makes for a different take on an age-old story that most of us grew up with. But one thing is clear to me: although some parts of the morals of the tale remain valid, this movie is mostly adult-oriented and, as such, the least it deserved was better acting.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

305,camturk,The Best Most Faithful Jungle Book Adaptation To Rudyard Kipling's Classic Book (1894) To Date!,9,8 December 2018,Absolutely Amazing Brutal Jungle Book Film as It was meant to be told through Rudyard Kipling's vision. Don't expect anything to do with Disney in this Film or any of the Classic Songs (Bare Necessaties or I wanna be like you) that we've all gotten use to. Andy Serkis truly meant what he said when he stated a while ago that this was a much more Darker film than all the other film adaptations! Andy Serkis and Warner Bros really did not hold back on it's Blood and Violence for a 12A or PG:13 film and I Loved That! Don't show your young Kids this movie though whatever you do. I'd say this movie is only suitable for Kids older than 10 years old. Benedict Cumberbatch pretty much Destroy's Idris Elba's performance as Shere Khan. Idris Elba was Brilliant as Shere Khan but Benedict Cumberbatch was just Perfection as the Villain Man Eating Tiger's performance! Andy Serkis was Amazing as Kipling's True version of Baloo and Christian Bale was so Loveable as Bagheera! Cate Blanchett as Kaa was Mesmerizing (In a Good way) and Top Notch and I was so Happy she was Not a Villain in this one just like He was Not a Villain in the Book (Kaa was a Male Protagonist 30 Feet Long Indian Rock Python in the Book). Need I go on? All of the performances were Brillaint Including Peter Mullen as Akela! My only slight Negative was I felt at times the CGI of the Motion Capture was Unfinished especially with Kaa the Snake but only at times. Overall I Can't Recommend this Movie Enough! Go Watch It and see what Rudyard kipling's True version of his Book was really like.,Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

Didn't one of you challenge this monstrosity?
You had everything in place, including the heritage of a wonderful piece of movie history in the original to springboard from.Poor shere khan, played magnificently, had no choice but to kill the cattle. We are removing his habitat.

Remaking the Disney movie was 100% unnecessary, why remake a movie if you are just going to do hand drawn scenes in cg. This is a new spin on the story, more in tune with the legend of the jungle book from 94. More adult themes, more blood. The animals actually fight each other and wares the scarrs of those battles. The cgi is not 100% at all times but that doesn't matter because the story pulls you in. I would recommend any parents to watch this first before showing it to your kids. It's very dark in a 80s adventure kids movie kind of way and what flied as kids movie back then might be to rough for the snowflake kids of today.

It isn't predictable and there are a few plot twists from the recycled originals. This isn't by any means a disney kiddie film nor a musical. It is more of a grown up realistic approach (besides talking animals). In all honesty it's a breath of fresh air on Mowgli's story.

327,bjsaint-34582,Jungle Book 3: Fumble Book,4,8 December 2018,"I have compelled myself to write a review for this movie. I just finished it. The thoughts are fresh so I'm getting right to it.I'll get the pros out of the way right now.Voice acting was awesome.
CGI was good. Don't let the negativity about the unrealistic visuals deter you. Animals are talking, people. They do it justice.Some of the action scenes are cool.Ok, done.SO... the plot in this movie became so ridiculous in the second half that it ruined the pleasures I felt watching the former half. First the so-called ""law of the jungle"" is such a stupid concept, allowing evil animals like Shere Khan to wreak havoc will pacifistic WOLVES and other predators (you very much witness them murder other animals) sit idly by, justifying themselves by following a code of broken conduct. At one point Bagheera tells Mowgli he's not safe in the forest (no doubt because of their ""sacred"" law) and Bagheera prods him into joining up with the humans. He meets the evil white hunter, a man hired by the village to kill Shere Khan. (Mowgli does exactly that later) He takes him in, feeds him, gives him shelter, gives him a knife, and cares for him. Later we see Mowgli secretly go into the back rooms of the hunter hut, and finds... ya know, hunter things. The movie is obviously and painfully trying to make him out to be this second hand antagonist, especially when we get to the point where Mowgli comes across the HEAD of one of his best wolf friends.At this point we should be like, ""the hunter is such a bad dude.""No. MOWGLI is a bad dude. The next scene starts with Mowgli about to murder the hunter in his sleep with the very knife he gave him.Instead, Mowgli makes an elephant do it for him, completely throwing out the moral jungle code, and uses the knife to kill Shere Khan. Thank you hunter for providing him with a weapon.Oh right... and then the elephant gores the hunter to death, just AFTER the hunter tried to KILL. SHERE. KHAN.Long story short, this movie became too inconsistent with its own logic, struggling to give us a poor message that totally ruins the flow of the movie. I can say so much more, but I won't. I didn't expect much at the start, and it still disappointed me. Watch purely for Bale and Cumberbatch.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

335,Wise_Otherwisee,A gripping and Intriguing watch,8,8 October 2019,"This adaptation of Rudyard Kipling's classic is surely one to be remembered for a long time.
There are many jolly adaptations by Disney and others in the form of movies or cartoon series, so one more jolly and adaptation wouldn't have made any difference.
This is not just the tale of a boy being brought up in jungle in fact how he is being brought up and how he grow up in the jungle.
Coming to cinematography, from bird's eyes views of jungle to spectacular closing scene, it surely has remarkable cinematography. The only thing that goes wrong is the small gaps between two similar scenes(bird's eye views) which makes it appear like repititive. But since its jungle, we expect some more mind blowing visuals covering the flaura and fauna of jungle.
As far as background score is concerned, being an Indian I can say it's just brilliant. The experimentation that the maker has done is noteworthy, for instance the man singing alap in high pitch in the opening scene. It truly amazed me as a viewer.
The voiceovers are as good as they can be with special mention to Benedict Cumberbatch, for Sher khan has been as fearful as I could've imagined him.
Frieda Pinto has as always been impressive and effective in her short role. Rohan has turned out to be a good choice for the role of Mowgli.
This adaption goes a step further from a children's classic to a more realistic and gripping narration of how the jungle system works. Few scenes that deserves special mention

Baloo teaching Mowgli the three laws

The special effects are excellent and young Rohan Chands performance and skill at portraying Mowgli is to be commended. At times, I found it to be quite emotional and you would do well to watch this movie without shedding a small tear.

These are getting more as the story develops and make it less pleasurable by the minute.I was rather excited to have Kaa in this movie not clearly painted as a villain, and to have her save the day when it comes to the monkeys was a special treat, as I love this part in the book. She however turns into a rambling Galadriel-snake and when she finished the movie with a speech that can only be described as utterly supid, then this movie finds a somehwat fitting end:Mowgli standing on pride rock, the savier and lord over the jungle.

360,serge_elia,"Disappointing in parts, but awesome in others",7,7 December 2018,"Andy Serkis' Mowgli was announced prior to Jon Favreau's The Jungle Book, and it is said to be much darker and much more faithful to the Rudyard Kipling original stories. However, I still stand on this: the Favreau film was also dark (with its terrifying portrayal of Shere Khan, brilliantly voiced by Idris Elba), and was also faithful to the books. Anyway, I waited for the Serkis film with anticipation, and when I watched it today on Netflix, I say this: I loved it, but some parts were disappointing. What is great and what is unsatisfactory?What is unsatisfactory: I felt that I was rewatching the Favreau film. I'm not kidding: I felt that this movie was a copy-paste remake of the... remake! With the *exact same* elements: Bagheera finds Mowgli (BTW, it should be ""Mowgli"" as in ""now"" and not ""no"") abandoned in the jungle after Shere Khan kills the boy's mother, and then entrusts our hero to the wolves; at one point, the panther tells Mowgli that he must go to the man-village, since ""the jungle is no longer safe for him"", all due to Shere Khan's growing threat. Got any Disney flashback, anyone?Also, while Benedict Cumberbatch as Shere Khan is definitely scary, he still doesn't match Idris Elba's portrayal of the character - Serkis did describe the character as ""a damaged individual"", but Elba's portrayal is in my opinion MENTALLY DERANGED. I did not like Serkis as Baloo nor Tom Hollander as Tabaqui the hyena (interesting, since I thought the character was a jackal in the Kipling stories), the both being just over-the-top.
Additionally, the scenes with Freida Pinto as Mowgli's adoptive human mother are great; however, the character was mostly silent throughout the movie, and there wasn't a lot of relationship between her and Mowgli. Instead, the film focused on the greedy British hunter, played by Matthew Rhys, who was way stereotyped and clichéd in my opinion.
Last but not least, the biggest flaw was probably the visual effects. While still impressive visually, the movie did not show entirely realistic animals, unlike the Favreau film, which nailed it with its far more astonishing CGI.What is great: the action scenes are top-notch and scary, not to mention ungodly realistic (with lots of shots showing blood), the plot is indeed far more faithful to the Kipling books than any of the Disney adaptations, the cast is talented, especially Cate Blanchett as Kaa, the most frightening character of them all. But the ultimate best character is definitely Rohan Chand as Mowgli: his role was much more difficult than Neel Sethi in the Favreau film, and yet he nailed it with his performance; as a result, we get to see a true feral child from the jungle, with the conflict he is going through (wondering where he belongs). Also, the way he discovers and interacts with the humans is hypnotizing.So, on the whole, Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle is a good film, really fun and entertaining, with amazing moments that capture the essence of the source material, and a talented cast, though not without its flaws.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
361,themodernholmes,Terrific!,8,5 January 2019,"I had never seen an adaptation of The Jungle Book that is more realistic than this one, let alone ""as"". I would elaborate more on what I mean, but I can't give away important details of the film. However, I can say the following. The actor who plays Mowgli in this film is far better than what we have seen before. He can, to a great degree, convince you of what is happening at the moment. He can convince you that he is finding real difficulty knowing what he actually is. He can convince you that he is gradually trying to disbelieve that he is a wolf and gradually believing that he is a man. The story also is very well written and convincing. What might have caused some low ratings in my opinion, however, is that the animals themselves could probably have been portrayed in a better way as to their looks. This, in my opinion, is probably the only way where The Jungle Book (2016) beats this film. Overall, however, this film is ten times better than the 2016 one.

Accurate details are one of the things that makes a movie great for me, and this was just all over the place. I get that this is a fantasy story, but it wasn't THAT kind of fantasy, it had a degree of realism to it that was ruined by the fact that they couldn't even make the animals accurately, both aesthetically and geologically.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

364,Luvmovies00,Great story-telling and worth watching,7,15 December 2018,"I watched this without any expectation and found myself engaged in the story of our jungle boy, Mowgli. From the music, story, the darker tones, and those damn voice acting. Every character stands out and creates a nuance that got you hooked up. The 1/3 last part of the movie could be better tho. I feel like they rushed things up and ruin the flow that the film had tried to build before the climax. That being said, i still love the movie and hope it gets as much love as it deserves",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
365,kirtimandas,"Closer to the story, a must watch",9,10 December 2018,"What most people don't know is that the original Jungle Book by Kipling wasn't a children's entertainment story. It was dark, full of horrifying brutality that made Mowgli the hard-hearted legend. Disney changed it, gave songs, made Baloo a honey loving herbivore. This version is much better and more faithful as an adaption. As an Indian, I can say the culture is on-point. This story is much more heart-breaking, which is exactly what Kipling was aiming for. It is just disappointing that this movie came out on a smaller platform of Netflix and also under the shadow of Disney's billion dollar might (and that is why people will always compare to that and give bad reviews, complaining about it's violence) but this movie is the one which will get a cult following.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

369,lavanyajey,"Darker, but I just disagree. A lot.",3,12 December 2018,"Andy did a fantastic job with some of the characters (Baloo mostly). However, I do have some positives but more negatives. I did enjoy the darker concept but wished this was explored further. I'm not commenting on the graphics here in detail. Yes, some of them were dodgy but not entirely unbearable.Positives can be summarised relatively quickly. Gorgeous jungle, I enjoyed the introduction of Bhoot and loved Baloo. Was also a fan of the sacred Jungle Laws in addition to Bagheera being a hero and explaining that killing is not a sport and to look the deceased in the eye as they pass so their soul is not alone when it departs (what a babe).What really bothered me were issues (and some lies) as follows:
Why lie about Bagheera? He is hands down, one of the wisest and regal characters from the original story. I did not appreciate the fact there was a brief tell tale that he was born in a palace with no explanation as to how he came to the jungle and suddenly was an expert hunter (to the point where he was basically training wolf cubs) when he would have been a cub and lacking life lessons before even coming to the jungle. Where did this concept come from? If Andy was going to run with this line, why not conclude a proper explanation instead of Bagheera giving Mowgli half a story before running off... Also, Bagheera and Baloo had the most unnecessary fight. Didn't take issue with Benedict's portrayal though.Was Kaa just a bored and nosy neighbour who just watched everything? Why did she suddenly protect Mowgli one second and the next meeting act like she was some don and would eat him if he bored her?I don't know if this was just bad animation but Tabaqui is supposed to be a golden Jackal, not a hyena. I know this is a slight point and nothing too major but it's just on the list of inaccuracies.What was the need to taxidermy Bhoot in a tent? It seemed cruel and unnecessary. I suppose it did highlight the true colours of the hunter in an interesting way, but I just think that was random.I can only assume the mossy elephant was supposed to be Hathi. Again, the random inclusion that the hunter stole the tusk in 2 seconds and reaching some bargain about helping Mowgli in exchange for him showing him the hunter was random and rushed.The hunter puts Mowgli in a wooden cage and before trying to communicate with him. After cooked food fails, his first thought is to teach him knife tricks? Also, why is the hunter an alcoholic? How did this contribute to the plot? I get the inclusion of the hunter was to reiterate man was ruining everything and using him as an example. Kind of sticking to the original which is fine. However, the taxidermy of Bhoot, obvious drinking problem was a bit random. I also don't like that the hunter was initially introduced as an ali to Mowgli before we saw his taxidermy collection.Since when do tigers (solitary hunters) need a gang of monkies to be badass? When did this ever happen in the novel? When has that ever happened generally?When Shere Khan was introduced, he had a crippled foot (true to the original story). What I would have loved would be if we had some sort of back story as to why he was so mad. Like did his parents get killed by man when he was a cub? Did Mowgli's parents or village make his life hell which resulted in the underlying rage? Was Shere Khan a super fan of the Jungle and simply was mad that man had found their way in? Did hunters taxidermy his family? I just dislike the fact that only the novel and 1994 live action version didn't completely depict him as a super villain without reason. That would have been an interesting take and could have deepened the whole point that man is danger and was getting too close to the sacred Jungle and Khan was being territorial.Mowgli. I hated the portrayal of this character. He was overacting to say the least and just in terms of character development he bratty, rude and clearly had no regard to the Law of the Jungle. He was extremely quick to turn his back on his pack when they needed him most. I just found myself thinking that someone should have eaten him just to save the jungle from the cold sore that Mowgli had become. Literally he did the opposite of everything he was advised and then got bratty about it when things didn't work out.Akela was KNOWN for being a strict law abider. This part of his character stayed true. I don't like the fact that he keeps getting killed off at random. If it's not after a little slap, it's a random misfired bullet by a supposed hunter expert. His choice to leave Mowgli as leader was severely questionable. I understood that in the novel, Shere Khan tricks the younger wolves to manipulate Akela in missing his first kill. Andy's version sort of touched on this without actually showing Shere Khan as tricking them into this.I think Andy had some lovely ideas here. He may have gotten carried away with the artistic licence and inaccuaries. However, if this was going to be a modern or different take, I just don't think it should be linked to the well known and loved classic. I wish this movie was longer to delve in to the story further. I don't know what the drama was with WB and Andy (or whoever), but I think if Andy ran the movie a bit longer, this would have allowed him more time for character and story development Loved the dark elements - a really good foundation. I just wish he expanded more on some characters (Kaa and Shere Khan in particular). I think he could have left Tabaqui out completely to be honest (like he did with Louie). I honestly was hoping that this (or even the 2016 Jungle Book) would have expanded more on why Shere Khan had some issues. Like how juicy if we saw his man struggles as a starter and then fast forwarding to Mowgli being found and living as a wild man for the main and dessert being that Khan and Mowgli had a juicy confrontation?Sorry for the rant. I'll stop now. Well done for the good parts though Andy!",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

It had a much darker tone, which was appreciated for this story. The CGI was on point, the voice casting was perfect. Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett, Andy Serkis, and of course Benedict Cumberbatch never fails to entertain as an amazing villain. Plus in this film Mowgli was treated as an actual character to carry the story, rather than just a character that has to be there just cause he's the protagonist.

Although Disney made a wonderful job with the special effects and animation of the animals, Netflix succeded in the relationship between them and Mowgli, and that got me. The voice of the wolves, Bagheera, Baloo, Kaa, etc are extremely touching, they made me connect with the characters deeper; made me feel the story, engage with it and love every second of the story.Mowglis performance is delightful and so moving, you believe in his love for the jungle familily since the beginning of the movie.At first I wasn't too convinced to watch the film, but from minuto one I fell in love with it.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

CGI is mixed; initial scenes I felt the kid was not so good, but as the film progressed, I found that not to be the case. Examples: the scene where he is in the pond, and Sher Khan has a drink, or, after he is pinned down by the panther in the Running. At some points, I felt the movie was a bit too drawn out.

393,ixchelleyr,Traumatic for sensitive kids and cruel for special needs families,1,12 May 2020,"The family decided to watch this on Mother's Day and ended with my 9 year old in tears. She refused to finish watching the movie.Besides the weird mangy look of all the animals and unconvincing acting, the biggest problem was with the dark way this movie told an otherwise beloved story.There are vivid lines where the Tiger speaks of tasting Mowgli's parent's blood and the like.Every death scene has animals with eyes wide open and the camera panning to the open dead eyes (creepy).Specifically, there is a scene where Mowgli and his best friend, an albino wolf named Bhoot, have words. Boots is fun loving and trying to cheer up Mowgli. Mowgli shouts at the happy go lucky Bhoot that they are NOT special and ""that's just something your mom said to make you feel better...you just came out wrong!"".Me (37) and my 32 year old brother both gasped and clutched our hearts at the cruelty of this statement. I can only imagine if a family with any special needs children watching this might have felt.But the worst part comes later when Mowgli inspects the hut of the hunter in the movie and finds Bhoot's head taxidermied on a pike.At this point my 9-year-old had had enough and burst into hyperventilated tears and stormed out. Yes, she's a sensitive soul, and if you have tough kids this probably won't be an issue. But if you are into gentle parenting and/or a household where depictions of violence is not for your kids then beware, this movie is dark and unnecessarily harsh.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
394,caymieperkins,So emotional.,10,10 June 2021,"Great movie. Every scene takes you for a loop that you weren't expecting. I'm sorry but it has to be said... WHY DID BHOOT HAVE TO DIE?! I understand the message and why his character had to create an impact in mowglis life and cause him to get angry with the poacher. Couldn't the tusk from the elephant be enough? By far the saddest movie I've seen since The Fox and the Hound or Land of Time. The fact that Bhoot's character was such an uplifting spirit and happy go lucky character. Who was different than the rest of the pack. He didn't fit in either because he looked different and was smaller than the rest. I knew right away something bad would happen to him. Call it instinct if you want but since we are going by animal laws, I knew something would happen and I was ok with that going forward. But when you see Mowgli yell at him and that sad wolf-like human face is so heartbroken because he doesn't understand what he did wrong. He never let the other wolves get to him but he was devastated that Mowgli, out of all the animals, it was Mowgli who crushed his spirit and hurt his feelings. To which I cried when that happened. But then later on.. when you see Mowgli exploring the hunter's ""trophies"", you then see that sweet, innocent, goofy smile of Bhoot, DEAD, stuffed and mounted... I was done. For me, that was too far. So innocent and pure, he was heartbroken and scared. After he ran off, he was sad and alone, betrayed by the one person who truly understood his struggles. And died alone. He was special in two different kinds of ways. Special to those he loved because he looked different, not like his brothers or sisters, smaller but had a heart of GOLD. And different in the eyes of the hunter because he was a unique white wolf. I understand this happens in the real world and reality and life sucks, but why is it always the ones who are good and pure, the ones who suffer the most? This was true and reality in our world as much as it is in the animal kingdom. This broke my heart and I thought it was too far. I don't think this needed to happen and I did NOT expect this. I'm not dissing this, I just hate that it happened. I bawled like a baby. But all around, I totally recommend this movie. It didn't matter to me that the CGI was different. The story line was so good and the twists and the keeping you on the edge of your seat and the events that hit you so hard in the feels that you just want to turn it off and realize that your heart just grew two sizes bigger while you yell at the tv ""WHY BHOOT!?!?"" And cry and cry and cry. I cannot watch this movie again for the fact that I die a little each time I think about that sweet sweet face of that happy go lucky, heart of gold, positive, little kid-like wolf.

As others have said, the CGI seemed surprisingly off giving it an overly cartoonish nature that detracted from the strong themes of the story. In many ways the characters felt overdone which I guessed was meant to cater to a younger audience. But THEN the story became dark very quickly and that's where it went from a 4/10 to an 8/10 film. Brilliant more adult interpretation of The Jungle Book delving into themes which ranged from moderately to very disturbing at times. It's a real shame the beginning let it down so badly because one comes out with a powerful impression from the second half.

I didn't like this version of either Mowgli himself or Baloo, possibly because of the performances.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
416,iammcgale,Disney take note,10,7 December 2018,15 minutes into this movie and Benedict Cumbebatch puts Idris Elba's Shere Khan too shame. This is a very different take on the Kipling and is better of for being different. I do think it's a pity WBs chose not to release this in theatres but being a Netflix release will reach far more people. I highly recommend this movie.,Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
417,jtotheltothet,Mowgli. For adults.,8,12 December 2018,"Goes back to its source material, follows the same darker tone as Rudyard Kipling's book. Kind of like the opposite of a Disney movie. No, Baloo does not sing ""The Bare Necessities"". Not a musical. Instead an interpretation scored amazingly by Nitin Sawhney, managing to help the viewer to connect between this world of animals and men
My favourite character was Tabaqui the hyena voiced by Tom Hollander. What a creepy little guy, his scavenger movements and devilish face. Scared me more than Shere Khan did. The second creepiest character to me was albino wolf Bhoot... need I say why......?
This is a dark movie. We got blood all over Baloo fighting off ravenous monkeys. We've got wolf kills. But don't scare yourselves too much, it's just CGI animation giving all the animals weird human-like eyeballs a la Andy Serkis.
This movie will perform really well on Netflix. I'm sure this darker tone applied to Disney's past has a bright future!",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
418,keefmiester,Why don't the animals look like they should?!,6,2 January 2019,"Not a bad film, good for children.But what I can't understand is why all of the animals, no doubt costing a huge amount of money on CGI, don't look like the animal their meant to represent? Almost everyone is a stub nosed version of their actual animal self?Not writing this for any real negative downer on the film, I just don't understand why you would make them look like this.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
419,evankrtanner,Disney did it better,7,19 January 2019,"The film began poorly with Rohan Chand's performance looking as if Andy Serkis had neglected to share any green screen secrets with the young actor. However, his performance as well as the story drastically improved towards the middle of the film. But it is the uncanny decision to animate the characters as if they all have mange that is most irritating, especially considering it takes so much away from the high quality cast Netflix was able to get on board. It certainly could have been so much more or perhaps my expectations were set too high. Disney did it better.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
420,sebma,Surprised,7,9 December 2018,"If interested to watch a more accurate take on The Jungle Book, Mowgli is a strong option. This film focuses on the protagonist of Mowgli and further explores his identity and purpose.I found the plot to be very easy to follow, but it wasn't very broad or complex. It was exciting on the other hand to be fooled by twists and unexpected turns, as the story progressed.Acting was in my opinion well done. Rohan delivered a believable Mowgli. He balances his acting skills to that of a likeable protagonist, as much as he handles the peril moments with realism. Notable credit for impressive VA was seen in Bale as Bagheera & Benedict as Shere Khan. But overall I found the VA acting to be on point. I was happy to see a Jungle Book adaption also feature Tabaqui who played an important role in the source material.The visual effects divides from viewers taste. I however appreciate the direction they went with. I found their motion capture to give these animals expressive and emotional connections, to the overall tone of the film. I think it's a stretch by people to assume that it's badly animated. The animation is fine and there is a lot of attention to detail on the animals fur and movements. The look of the jungle & backgrounds, looked appealing and believable. There is some obvious filming on real life locations, which is greatly appreciated.Final Thoughts
Overall Mowgli surprised me.
The trailer did not do the film justice. Visually spectacular and a well acted feature with a slightly episodic direction. I was surprised that I enjoyed this film so much. Give it a chance if you're interested to see a different take on the well known story.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

The performance for the main character was iffy at best and his character arc in certain parts is quite strange. But the main thing that's stuck with me, BHOOT.I can't stop thinking about it. Why oh why did they kill off this character? Especially in the way they did it. He's the one character that you want to rise above all of the harsh treatment throughout the whole film, especially after the scene where Mowgli literally breaks his heart into two. The next thing we see of him, he's just dead all of a sudden, like wtf?If this was the only criticism of the whole film then I could let it slide, but this is the main highlight of the poorly executed script from a film that showed a lot of potential",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

The part about Bhoot was powerful and disturbing. The fact that there was no redemption for the poor outcast broke my heart. If he only knew how prized albinos are in our world. It posed an interesting perspective, however; we find albino animals fascinating and unique, but often treat albino humans just as the other wolves treated Bhoot.

The main character is a human and was raised by wolves like Tarzan. (He doesn't know he is human he just knows he is different.) Later on the animals do voting and decide to keep the boy-""cub,"" they continue to introduce another different wolve named Bhoot. He is constantly getting bullied but is so easy going about it. Once the main character finds out he is human his friend, Bhoot tries to make him feel better. The main character lashes out and Bhoot runs away. The main character gets captured by humans after being thrown out from the jungle and makes friends. His friend is a hunter and they later go into his taxidery room and they find Bhoot's head. He's dead. The main character ends up getting the chief killed in a long stretch after the hunter is drunk and is trying to shoot.

I would tag it as more enticing and applaud it more than the movie 'The Jungle Book', for its sheer intention to follow a more engaging plot.The basic story is same as the original story of 'The Jungle Book' with interesting tweaks and emphasis on the emotional quotient. Watch the film to get my drift.Mowgli 'the man-cub' brushing shoulders with the human race in the village constituted an interesting watch. Similarly Mowgli meeting Kaa-The Python, and Sheer Khan in the 'Monkey people's' cave were quite dramatic and grabbing. Its enchanting to watch the little but much more matured Mowgli assume the centre-stage and take the onus to kill Sheer Khan, the cunning tiger and release mankind as well as the jungle from the wrath of the beast, at the end.Besides the heartening screen play and adventurous turn of events in the movie we can figure out social messages delivered from the tongue of the carnivores in the film, which I think have been portrayed bit sarcastically and the sarcasm was towards mankind (there's a strong irony that a man-cub movie carries socio-environmental messages against the misdeeds of mankind)

463,kizziebee,"Good...a few issues, but good!",6,15 December 2018,"Firstly, I love the cast and the animation. It was visually awesome. Loved the new approaches to the characters. Loved the characters. And it's a tale I'll always enjoy. Andy Serkis is a true master on, off, and behind the scenes.I just have a few problems with it.
My biggest issue of ALL was Bhoot. There was absolutely no redemption for this baby. He was the comic relief. Bullied and outcast, but so bright and loving only to have his spirit dashed in one fleeting moment of targeted emotion from Mowgli...and then the next time we see him he's a horrifying fixture in a game hunter's collection?? That literally destroyed my mood for the whole rest of the film. There was no addressing the bullying, no personal victories for him. Not even when becoming a casualty, did his death amount to anything other than extreme grief and tragedy. His life ended without it meaning anything. There was no heartfelt reflection from Mowgli or anyone, no apologies made, no lesson learned for Mowgli or any of those triflin' wolves that bullied Bhoot. Just nothing. It was just heartbreaking. They made you love him and lose him. And that was it. A great way to kill MY spirit is to kill the spirit of a puppy, make me watch that, and then actually kill the puppy and then make me watch THAT-not the killing part, but the shockingly horrifying reveal of his severed head on a flank of wood...same horrible difference.I felt like introducing the hunter as this compassionate human who helped Mowgli adjust and learn and to be a source of comfort, only for him to suddenly become this maniacal game hunter leading Mowgli to then orchestrate an elaborate plan of revenge...it just didn't flow for me. Why create the character to genuinely bond with Mowgli and help him and then so quickly turn him into a villain with no foreshadowing or hint to his deep-seated villainy-to what end? What did this serve? It felt like the Hunter became a prop to some kind of message the movie was attempting to make in the end and I didn't quite get it. Kaa narrates in the end, ""with the tiger and hunter now gone..."" Mowgli was able to usher in a ""lasting peace"". But, the hunter was never introduced as a contributor to the darkness ever in this film. It was always Shere Khan. The closest we got to foreshadowing about the hunter was seeing the elephant with the missing tusk. But nothing was ever said or suggested that connected that elephant's misfortune with the hunter until it was too late.All of the humans in the village were wonderful to him, helpful and loving. All of whom were Indian except for the one foreigner who suddenly became the villain. So, why when the ONE foreigner-who, by the way was also wonderful to Mowgli-suddenly (and uncharacteristically) turns dark side (barely), was that enough incentive to just bounce on the whole town of people, especially the loving motherly woman who cared for Mowgli? I certainly understand returning to the family he grew up with, but no conflict, no emotional hangups at all?? It made the villagers and their existence feel ultimately pointless to the story and especially to Mowgli's character arc. It set him up to meet the hunter whom he eventually puts a hit out on, and so other than that, there was no purpose to this moment. He didn't learn to speak. Don't think he learned a trade or how to cook...something. Was the point of the village really so that Mowgli would discover knives and how to wield them in a Tiger fight??And to my next issue...The finale fell a little flat for me. Mowgli squaring off with a huge tiger with a teeny knife was a little hard for me to swallow. But, I was down for the ride. It was a little disappointing to see all of Mowgli's family and friends show up to the showdown to support him and ultimately do nothing. They just watched.There just seems to be a lot that was not either fleshed out or was maybe lost to editing that would have connected these arcs and made for a more complete picture, and a more satisfying conclusion.I loved Baloo, for sure. Mowgli's training with Baloo was all good stuff. Running scene was fun. All scenes with Bhoot except the one when he was dead and NO ONE mourned him or talked about him afterwards...I don't even know if his mama knows he's dead! Just...okay...I'll stop talking about Bhoot. But that really took off a lot of points for me. Anywhoo...it was good, just not great and not a version of this tale I'll likely watch again.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

*awe striking parallels
We can see many similarities between the world of ""man"" and the world of the ""jungle"". You have the pack and the village, the hunter and the tiger, each a caring mother figure, as well as an out of place ""freak"" on borh sides. Truly it can be seen a story simply about some animals and a few humans but perhaps it dives into deeper meaning m; not only with the jungles peace but a man's peace and strength within himself. *Warning spoilers*
If you have seen the film I'm sure while Mowgli was searching the hunters tent you too were expecting to see the end of the elder elephants tusk. However, when the light eliminated his closest friends hollow corpse-what was once a people of hope-simply became the same jungle he had just ran away from.
People can be like animals and animals like people but what it comes down to is yourself and wether we will allow ourselves to be run by fear and pride or respect and love for life.
Even when facing his greatest enemy he learned respect for life and understanding from the love of it.
I would almost call it a masterpiece.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

479,ebaugheb,Well Captured,7,9 December 2018,After seeing all the other Jungle Book movies made by Disney. Finally someone has been able to capture the real and the most important aspects of the actual written book. Watching this film makes you feel you have not missed anything from the actual book.,Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
480,kumarvinay-20949,Very good story arc in spite of the shortcomings,9,10 December 2018,"This movie actually explores the making of Legend - Mowgli. It explores the relation of Mowgli with the Wolves, bagheera and Baloo, and also his transformation from a conflicted kid to a confident boy. And off course for the comparison, it might not have the same elegant animation effects as the Disney one, but story wise it is far more satisfying. A better movie I would say.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
481,mmehirdel,2016 Disney or 2018 Netflix?,10,10 December 2018,"This version is more detailed version of the 2016 Disney movie, The Jungle book. If I had to pick which one was better, I'll go with this one. I really enjoyed the story and was surprised by the graphics!! 10/10!",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
482,jermainegrant-60138,Pointless,3,10 December 2018,"Dissapointed. Story is weak no central focus, constant contradictions throughout the film.Too much information in the dialogue feels like a 13year old wrote the it. Cgi is very good and is something to desire mowgli integrates within the cgi world seamlessly.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
483,dariusschellenbach,This movie is terrible,1,10 December 2018,"So I used to love the story of The Jungle Book and it´s original animated version might be one of my favourite movies ever made. But this absolute piece of filth does no justice to that original whatsoever. Not because of the story but because of the casting of Rohan Chand.Rohan Chand(who portrays Mowgli), who was probably cast due to his look(which I must admit makes him appear like a perfect fit) is incredibly unconvincing in his emotions, his lack of control over his voice makes everything he says sound incredibly forced , his facial expressions never match what he´s trying to express as he keeps making the same stupid face. He is without a doubt the worst member of the cast and based on his acting, someone I hope to never see in another movie.The CGI in this movie is quite conflicting as the backgrounds and landscapes are actually quite gorgeous but the animals look absolutely ridiculous. They all have some weird human structure in their face causing them all to resemble Falkor from The Neverending Story. This is also made a lot worse by the fact that they decided to give all the animals human-like eyes.One of the very few positive aspects of this 104 minute lasting assassination of my joy, is the voice acting which is done masterfully especially by Andy Serkis and Benedict Cumberbatch.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
484,ursinecar,RECOMMEND,10,11 December 2018,"I havent seen Disney the jungle book 2016, Disney is more like aimed towards children I would say,but however I'm not really into any of the jungle book type movies in general, BUT THIS THIS CAUGHT MY EYES FOR SOME REASON and I loved it it's more dark and feels more true. NOW the fact I signed up just to give this movies a 10/10 means SOMETHING I usually dont wasmt time on things like this. RECOMMEND YOU WATCH IT MATE",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
485,chloewalton-61354,Dissatisfied,3,12 December 2018,"I understand that Mowgli is not the Jungle Book, but I'm glad I watched this film before my children watched it. Baloo is meant to be a friendly looking bear and in this he has been turned in to an evil scary looking beast, it's also very disturbing when Mowgli shouts at Bhoot and hurts him with his words, then next his head is in the hunters shack, very very disturbing and shouldn't be in a children's film. Also, I understand it's not the jungle book again but where are the songs... I liked the film apart from a few disturbing scenes",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
486,gmaggs-29887,A movie with heart,8,13 December 2018,What I love about this adaption of the Jungle Book is that there is such powerful emotion in the faces and movements of each animal character. Andy has done an excellent job of pulling viewers into a story and its a good story at that. Great choice of actors. Thanks Andy for a great movie,Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
487,shyamforever,The most realistic Jungle book ever made,10,13 December 2018,"It's amazing, realistic to the core and perfection on all the characters have been achieved, I don't find any flaws in this version, yes it's not only for kids but definitely for adults, kudos to the makers, I have enjoyed every second of it, I made an account only for this movie because I did not like what the critics were saying about it, they are just a bunch sad losers now days literally, listen to me ignore them and do your self a favor by watching it",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
488,novievan,Best of the best,10,20 December 2018,"This is kind of movie i rather to watch with my children, i love it so much, almost simular like jungle book but even better. My husband love it, and either my kids. Tumb's up 👍",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
489,salehanawaz,"Fall in Love, Stay There.",10,16 December 2018,"This is by far the best adaptation of ""The Jungle Book"" I have ever seen. I fell in love with Mowgli at first sight. He looked back as the ""true"" Mowgli. THIS is the Masterpiece VERSION.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
490,mv-89513,Can't get beyond the 'bad taxidermy' animals,1,17 December 2018,"I was really looking forward to seeing this more realistic Jungle Book, but that is not what I got. Storyline was fine. Didn't mind having no singing, but good god...throughout the whole movie I kept having flash backs to The Island of Dr Moreau. Everything looked like it was blended with baboon. Skulls were too wide, muzzles too narrow. And wth happened to Balloo? He looked like he barely escaped a massive fire. In my opinion these animals are so off putting, I never developed an attachment to them. I am so sadly dissappointed. Baby Mowgli was beyond adorable though.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
491,rgibsonus,Better than the jungle book,10,18 December 2018,Not everyone likes singing in their movies. Not perfect but better actors and story telling.,Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
492,csluka-52578,IT'S ABOUT TIME SOMEONE KNOWS HOW TO WRITE A STORY FOR A MOVIE MOWGLI 2018,10,18 December 2018,"I just signed up to this imdb.com just to make this comment for mowgli 2018 writer of the story line is the best I have seen in 10 yrs. The writer ""WHOEVER YOU ARE, GREAT JOB AND YOU GET A RAISE FROM ME LOL"". Oh ya the graphics was the top of the line all through the movie. My dog that looks like the white wolf called ""boot"" I think? looks like my sister dog that almost died the day before we watched this movie:( you know what I am trying to say. That would have really been bad on my part for getting this movie on netflix.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
493,andydatwork,Forget Disney - think Kipling,9,19 December 2018,"I'm genuinely impressed. Although the story line isn't authentic Kipling, the often dark characterizations are massively closer to those of Kipling than are Disney's saccharine versions, and the film is much the better for it.Even the choices of voices and (British) accents seem somehow much closer to what Kipling would have intended - Serkis' own Baloo has the tones of a elderly pre British Army Sergeant Major, gruff and assertive but ultimately deeply concerned with the fate of his charges.The only let down is that the CGI sometimes doesn't quite live up to the standards we except nowadays.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
494,michaelwatkins-51747,Don't listen to rubbish reviews.,10,20 December 2018,"Absolutely brilliant. Didn't expect it to be that good. Honestly one of the best films I have seen this year.
Kid actor really plays a good part. Even my misses cried lol.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
495,tranceaholics,"Critics are wrong, this is the better movie.",8,23 December 2018,"When I saw this movie's trailer I was wondering why they are making this movie so soon after Disney just created their version. But now I get it.I believe the CGI is worse than the Disney version. There are instances where it is almost cringeworthy, honestly. Points deducted for that.However, the movie itself is a far superior movie to the Disney film. The treatment is much more mature and the storyline is much more compelling. The actors Mowgli in both movies did a fantastic job, but this movie required more emotion, more shades of personalities and Rohan Chan's pulled it off no problem.If you tend to like movies that have a more serious tone, I believe you will prefer this one to the Disney one. I would probably let the kiddos watch the other version but this is better for adults by far. I wish it was longer so that they could devote more time to the Mowgli's relationship with the humans.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
496,emmakissel-88709,NEEDS A SEQUEL,10,29 December 2018,"Seriously profound, in an even greater sense than the book/previous films, but PLEASE DON'T STOP HERE!!!!

I'm no activist, but my god, I can see the eternal, spiritual and biological implications of this beautiful film... don't stop, PLEASE!!!!!",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
497,jamesfranklinsts,A most unpleasant film to watch,2,8 January 2019,"Despite a remake of the jungle book being released a short time ago, in many ways ""Mowgli"" improves upon some of the many short comings of the Disney remake, such as the cinematography and voice acting, however the poor story telling and disgusting CGI make it a tough film to sit through. Rohan Chand's performance was both cringe worthy and sickening to watch. Now that may be quite harsh to say of a child actor as he may have just not found his footing but i found his acting in 'Mowgli' to be on par with a brick wall, as well the fact of him looking all greased up to be just vile. One could argue it's supposed to look like sweat however it looks more like the crew covered the boy in Vaseline. I may revisit the film in the future and my opinion might change but as it stands, i found much of the camera work to be adequate and the voice acting to be leaps and bounds superior to the Disney's live action remake, but the fact is the film is terribly ugly with very little emotion in my opinion.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
498,merchantush,Truely worth watching,9,21 January 2019,"This movie is far better then disney version of jungle book, this is serious, dark and intense movie, and i don't think jungle is a comedy thing to explore as what shown in disney version, one thing is true this is not for kids and as a adult I always wanted to see realistic jungle book version of mowgli n this movie no doubt will fulfill ur expectations, this movie may not have much business as the jungle Book version of disney as tht movie was promoted on large scale, so pple were eager to see tht movie as jungle book version was coming on big screen after long time, i didnt even know whn this movie got released n may b due to lack of promotion this movie is not known to lot of pple, but if u pple are highly interested in watching the adult version of mowgli, go watch this movie, its been available on netflix. This movie is far better then jungle book, vfx, action sequence, are upto the mark, expressions of animals are truly realistic, felt bad for bhoot who is the frnd of mowgli, kaa role is much better than jungle book, so i recommend this movie to everyone who has grown up watching jungle book, even my 4yr old daughter loved this movie, she has watched it 3time in a row tht good is this movie, infact i m watching it rt now again for 3rd time",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
499,caylee_woodward,Should not be rated PG-13,1,29 January 2019,From the trailers and the rating I expected a good family friendly movie. Even Netflix lists it as a family drama and a family adventure. Kids should not watch this movie. It contains in my opinion horrible scenes of animal dead. And bhoot the cutest oddball that any adult and especially kid will love has the most horrifying death. It will ruin your night or your kids night. Do not watch this unless you want to be in fits of tears. Netflix should be ashamed to rate this PG-13.,Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle

501,alexisgreda,Nice but...,5,15 February 2019,"Darker version of Disney's The Jungle Book has a good vibe to it. It's not boring for adults but definitely frightening for kids.
And oh Lord the visuals. First thought of Shere Khan was ""does he have a down syndrome?"". Animals werent made real-like. The only animals that were good made was Baloo, Elephant and Kaa.",Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
502,Mousey_2,Jungle Book for Grown-ups,9,28 February 2019,A 6.5 rating? 6.5 is WAY too low. This movie is awesome. Gritty and tense. It is NOT for children. I was spellbound from the second minute until the end. The boy portraying Mowgli does an excellent job of it. The creatures are believable. The character development is very well done. You become part of the movie and the situation. You will grow to hate both The Hunter and Shere Khan. Many reviews mentioned the Disney movie so I finally went to see it. I couldn't take more than 5-minutes of that drivel. I went to see the recent remake of Jungle Book. It is for pre-schoolers. THIS is truly an animated movie for adults; seamless and fast paced. I can find nothing wrong with it. Do yourself a favor and watch it.,Mowgli - Legend of the Jungle
