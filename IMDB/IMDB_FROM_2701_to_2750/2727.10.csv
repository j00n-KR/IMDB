0,SnoopyStyle,George is not as adorable as Arthur,5,2 December 2014,"Popular songwriter George Webber (Dudley Moore) turns 42. He tells his singer girlfriend Samantha Taylor (Julie Andrews) that his life started at 40. He's having a midlife crisis. He is constantly fixated on young women. He follows one in particular who is a bride on her way to her wedding. Jenny Miles (Bo Derek) is the daughter of a prominent Beverly Hills dentist. He is struggling with the constant orgy next door, problems with Sam and drilling Jenny's father for information which leads to six cavities. He becomes fixated on Jenny and even follows the newlyweds on their honeymoon in Mexico.George is utterly sad, pathetic and not always funny. He just isn't adorable like his character in 'Arthur'. They're both sleazy sex fiends but there's a meanness in George. Whereas Arthur is self-destructive, George is simply selfish. It's not quite as appealing. Also Arthur has a soul mate which Julie Andrews isn't playing in this movie. I'm probably less attracted to her character here more than anything. There are moments of fun but they are fleeting.",10
1,Hitchcoc,Lightweight Junk,5,21 December 2016,"I do like Dudley Moore. He was a master musician, teacher, and comic. The problem was that his characters seem to bank on lowest common denominator efforts. Because most of us don't have the male credentials to entice someone like Bo Derek, we are left to only imagine. So what we have is a sad man who unhappy with what he has, making a fool of himself. It sets up another comedy by an odd looking little man, Gene Wilder, in The Woman in Red. The parts of the movie that are fun are the sight gags and pratfalls. This goes back to the roots of comedy, to the pathos of a Charlie Chaplain. But putting this into contemporary thought, we know it ain't gonna happen. Bo Derek is certainly quite the beauty, but other than the object of desire, doesn't have much to offer--or perhaps the plot doesn't. This is a pretty forgettable comedy, even with good intentions.",10
2,classicsoncall,"""Tonight I spend with you.""",7,24 May 2019,"I just recently watched Dudley Moore in ""Arthur"" and it reminded me of this earlier movie in which he appeared, which had the unique distinction of introducing both Bo Derek and the number '10' into the popular lexicon. Although to be quite honest, my buddies and I were using the '1 to 10' rating system for some time before this even came out, and judging by today's standards, I guess that makes me something of an incorrigible reprobate. Not to mention politically incorrect, but I digress.The passage of time has certainly taken the glow off of this popular flick of the late Seventies. All you'd ever see back then were those ubiquitous trailers of Derek frolicking her way toward the camera in that skin tight body suit, causing all manner of hypertension and mid-life crisis into the character of song writer George Webber (Moore). From the perspective of living well past the age of forty myself, George's self absorption and daydreaming his way into the life of Jenny Hanley (Derek) strikes me as decidedly silly, not to mention completely unrealistic. Jenny's willingness to partake in the creature comforts with George down in Las Hadas struck me as entirely contrived following her husband's luckless ocean outing, and George's opting out over the absurdity of it all was about the only meaningful decision he made in the picture.I think the only person I felt more sorry for than George was that poor gal Mary Lewis (Dee Wallace) who placed George's inadequacy on her own shoulders. She probably deserved a better screen treatment than she got here. And if there ever was an actress who was asked to perform a thankless part, it would be Julie Andrews as the unappreciated girlfriend of lusty George. It seemed like no one could catch a break in this film, unless you go with Brian Dennehy as the sympathetic bartender who just rolled with the punches. He probably should have tried to hook up with Mary.",10
3,lee_eisenberg,10 out of how many stars?,7,22 April 2006,"""10"" isn't really the sort of movie that I feel that I can just straightforward review, as it has its ups and downs. The plot of course has composer George Webber (Dudley Moore) going through his midlife crisis all obsessed with the hot young women, thereby messing up his relationship with girlfriend Samantha (Julie Andrews). I guess that if the movie has any problem, it's the casting of Moore. From everything that I've ever heard, it sounds like he was kind of worthless and undesirable to be around. Granted, in this movie he does a passable job as George, although it's hard to tell whether the movie is romanticizing or ripping at the LA lifestyle.As for the movie's famous scene - Bo Derek in her swimsuit - I don't know what else to say. She later spoofed that scene in ""Tommy Boy"", but I don't know what else she's done recently except appear at the Republican National Conventions. And who on the set of ""Mary Poppins"" would have ever guessed that Julie Andrews would eventually star in this? Among the really funny scenes in my opinion are the wedding (and the events leading thereto), and what happens when George identifies himself as a Brit. In a way, Dudley Moore was expanding on his character from ""Foul Play"". Still, I think that we're probably doing Blake Edwards a favor if we remember him more for the ""Pink Panther"" movies. Also starring Dee Wallace (yep, ET's mom!), Brian Dennehy, and that guy at the end was character actor Don Calfa; you're sure to have seen him somewhere.",10
4,ccthemovieman-1,Thoughts About '10' - Then And Now,6,4 June 2007,"Boy, this was ""hot stuff"" back when it came out in 1979: I am referring to both the movie AND Bo Derek!Actually, Dudley Moore was a box-office star, too. Nobody had heard of Derek before this, but this film certainly made her an overnight sensation. She didn't have to say anything in the film, just walk down a beach. Certainly, the number ""10"" now had a new meaning in the culture.Basically, the film is about a guy who spots Derek, and then totally makes a fool of himself over her. Most guys would have done the same thing. Moore, making an idiot of himself as ""George Webber,"" provided a lot of laughs and Bo had to just....well....just let herself be photographed. Fortunately, in real life, she turned out to be far more than just some hot- looking bimbo. I've heard her on several talk shows in recent years, and she's no dummy.....and still looks tremendous. Meanwhile, Moore, who had some tough physical ailments, really didn't have a noteworthy career after this film with one exception: Arthur (1981). The poor man died in 2002.One forgets that a huge big-name actress co-starred with Moore in this movie: Julie Andrews. Perhaps a good part of that reason we forget that is she doesn't play a memorable character. It fact, she's downright unappealing as Moore's girlfriend ""Samantha Taylor.""It's also easy to forget about some of the cultural issues songwriter ""Webber"" dealt with, bemoaning the shallowness of the current generation and its music tastes, and finally realizing his own shallowness won't lead to happiness just by being with a woman half his age. There are some profound things to ponder in this film even though it often concentrates on the slapstick humor angle. As a guy who has gone through the usual ""mid- life"" crisis, I would to sympathize with Webber's dilemmas but since this idiot is drunk half the time and an extremely self-indulgent person, I found it hard to ""root"" for him. Drunks have never been funny to me. So, when I watched this film on VHS 15 years later, it wasn't as fun as the fist time.Speaking of drinks, Brian Dennehy was excellent as a bartender. I wish he had played more ""nice guy"" roles like this during his career, instead of so many evil and profane villains.Along with millions of others, I enjoyed the movie 30 years ago, but now it's kind of sad, too slow and even painful to watch at times. For those of us who saw in the theater, the film now appears somewhat dated, but so are all of us, I guess, are dated, too.",10
5,moonspinner55,Sloppy mixture of slapstick and a hipster's idea of smut...,4,29 February 2008,"Writer-director Blake Edwards is so out of the loop he can't even fake being hip. This middle-age-crazy concoction, about a self-absorbed songwriter chasing after a youthful vision of beauty, has elements of lust without passion, broad comedy without skill, and pathos without anything substantial in the screenplay to back them up. When he's not tumbling, bumbling, or shrieking like a Cockney banshee, Dudley Moore struts smugly through the film, narrowing his eyes and pursing his lips in a fake imitation of an older man trying to look cool. There's nothing witty or surprising in this lumpy set-up, which includes Julie Andrews as a salty toughie with a sentimental side and Robert Webber as Moore's gay writing-partner (far be it for Edwards to miss out on a stereotype: the broken-hearted homosexual). Dudley can't even hide behind some flowers without getting a bee-sting to the schnoz, and he can't get a bee-sting without his nose naturally swelling up like a balloon. Bo Derek's corn-rowed infatuation inadvertently becomes the picture's drawing card, and for good reason: she's the only one here not putting on airs. *1/2 from ****",10
6,sunwarrior13,A Passable Film That Launched Bo Derek's Film Career,7,23 November 2019,"Dudley Moore, Julie Andrews and Bo Derek,who is catapulted into stardom, stars in this romantic comedy directed by Blake Edwards entitled,""10"". It tells the story of a middle-age songwriter who enters an affair with a young sexy woman after he feels midlife crisis.The movie basically is the film that launched the career of 80's sex goddess Bo Derek. No question that is why this film remains known after almost 40 years since its initial release despite the fact that it is passable in nature. Too bad that Bo Derek happens to be a non-actress who only captivated male viewers with her sex appeal. Overall,this happens to be Bo's best film in her career.",10
7,preppy-3,Dull and dated sex farce,1,27 December 2009,"George Webber (Dudley Moore) has just turned 40 and is going through male menopause. He's dating beautiful divorced Samantha Taylor (Julie Andrews) but can't commit to her. One day he spots a beautiful woman (Bo Derek) getting married and becomes obsessed with her. He wants her in bed badly and goes to ridiculous lengths to find her.I saw this back in 1979 and found it mildly funny and VERY R rated (LOTS of gratuitous female nudity). Today it's still extreme (in terms of nudity) but not even remotely funny. It has tired slapstick, homophobic comments and incredibly dated sexual politics (an argument between Andrews and Moore on the use of the word ""broad"" is just asinine). Also it's far too long and stops dead in its tracks multiple times for Moore to have his piano solos. On the plus side the acting is good (especially by Andrews who completely sheds her Mary Poppins image) and it's fun to see Sam Jones a year before he did ""Flash Gordon"" and Brian Dennehy and Dee Wallace are great in small roles. It does also have an accurate portrayal of what Hollywood was like in the late 70s with casual sex, drug abuse and the horrendous fashions and hair styles. There's also a subplot dealing with a gay couple (which must have been surprising to 1979 audiences) that is dealt with realistically and is actually more interesting than the Moore/Andrews/Derek storyline! This was (somehow) a monster hit and made Derek an instant sex symbol. Also her hairstyle in the movie became popular. Derek, by the way, is stunningly beautiful but her acting is atrocious. A very dull and dated sex farce. When you have tons of beautiful nude women in a movie and it's dull there's something seriously wrong.",10
8,Bunuel1976,"10 (Blake Edwards, 1979) **1/2",6,22 December 2007,"I've watched relatively few of director Edwards' non-PINK PANTHER films; among the ones I own that I've yet to catch up with are DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES (1962), WHAT DID YOU DO IN THE WAR, DADDY? (1966) and S.O.B. (1981).This one proved among Edwards' most successful films (though the curt, with-it title emerges to be rather meaningless), drawing attention to itself for treating a serious subject such as mid-life crisis in semi-comedic vein  though, ultimately, it's nowhere near as incisive or cinematically deft as Luis Bunuel's THAT OBSCURE OBJECT OF DESIRE (1977) wherein, likewise, a well-respected man continuously humiliates himself in his reckless pursuit of a much younger girl(s)  and, besides, results in being unbalanced somewhat by the slapstick passages.Edwards wrote the script for 10 himself: among the more notable dialogue stretches involve an argument between leads Dudey Moore and Julie Andrews (the director's real-life wife) regarding the definition of the ostensibly disparaging term ""broad"", and another later on between Moore and Bo Derek  his character's 'object of desire'  with respect to the girl's casual attitude towards sex. Even if she doesn't really feature in it till the last third, Derek became a sex symbol thanks to 10; that said, her contribution (mixing disarming naivete with effortless sensuality, like an updated version of Marilyn Monroe) is undeniably one of the film's trump cards and, on account of this, I might even have to rent the two notorious vehicles her actor/director husband concocted for her in the early 1980s. Andrews does well enough by her relatively colorless role (which, naturally, sees her as a singing star).Moore's part had originally been accepted by George Segal, but he left the project for some reason; later, it was offered to Edwards' former muse Peter Sellers who turned it down but, reportedly, did feature in a cameo  which scene, however, didn't make the final cut! Moore, whose career up to this point had been sporadic (with BEDAZZLED [1967], which I've just watched, as his only notable starring vehicle) suddenly found himself much in demand after his scene-stealing cameo in FOUL PLAY (1978). This would eventually lead to his most famous role, ARTHUR (1981; for which he received an Oscar nomination and one he reprised for a less successful sequel 7 years later), another collaboration with Edwards  MICKEY + MAUDE (1984)  and the remake of Preston Sturges' classic UNFAITHFULLY YOURS (1984).Despite the ample nudity (removed or concealed for network showings of the film) allowed by the current permissiveness in censorship  and which is even referenced in the very final scene  10 remains an old-fashioned entertainment at heart: not only is Moore's character a musician (as the star was in real life, after all) who has a (thankfully non-stereotyped) gay songwriting partner in veteran Robert Webber  but this is also evident in the conservative i.e. tasteful choice of exponents for the soundtrack (original music and songs by Edwards stalwart Henry Mancini, who gave the film its only Oscar nods, and such standard classical pieces as Ravel's ""Bolero"").Commendably, the writer-director also gives space here to the minor characters  notably when the scene shifts to Mexico, such as the sympathetic bartender played by Brian Dennehy and the woman with whom Moore has a clumsy fling (Dee Wallace). With this in mind, the film's single greatest laugh-out-loud moment comes fairly early on in the picture and has to do with the senile servant of the priest who celebrated Derek's marriage to future FLASH GORDON, Sam J. Jones (when he's visited by Moore in an attempt to learn more about her).",10
9,evanston_dad,A Far from Perfect 10,4,9 November 2007,"Any movie featuring Dudley Moore as an object of sexual attraction is doomed from the start, since I can't imagine anyone wanting to have sex with him.I CAN, however, imagine a lot of people wanting to have sex with Bo Derek, that is until they see her act.This Blake Edwards film is not good -- people think they remember it as being good, but what they're really remembering is a three-second slo-mo shot of Derek running through the surf. Like most of Blake Edwards' movies, it's limp and blah.Grade: C",10
10,Uriah43,A Delightful Comedy,7,3 April 2020,"Having just turned 42 and suffering from a midlife crisis, a musical composer by the name of ""George Webber"" (Dudley Moore) leaves his colleague's house and on the way home happens to see a beautiful bride in the back seat of a limousine being driven to a church for her wedding. Although he is currently in a committed relationship to a musician by the name of ""Samantha Taylor"" (Julie Andrews) he becomes determined to find out as much about this gorgeous woman as possible. What he doesn't take into account, however, is the difficulties this new obsession of his will bring upon everybody associated with him along the way. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that when this picture initially came out most people were intrigued by the sensational film debut of Bo Derek (as the bride ""Jennifer Hanley"") who became an international sex symbol overnight. However, there is much more to this movie than that as both Dudley Moore and Julie Andrews were nominated for Golden Globe Awards for their performances while Henry Mancini was likewise nominated for an Academy Award for his musical score. I especially liked the piano solo in the Mexican bar and the song by Julie Andrews at the very end which were both quite beautiful. In any case, while the film might not rate a perfect ""10"" it certainly had its moments and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",10
11,Wizard-8,Lightly amusing fluff,6,14 June 2020,"For several decades this film was always on my list of movies to watch, but for some reason I never got around to watching it until now. I'd had heard how hilarious it was supposed to be, though I didn't find it laugh out loud funny, just a silly but somewhat likable exercise. But at least it's more palatable than ""R"" rated movies in this day and age, because of its much different tone and pacing. What really surprised me about this movie was how leisurely paced it was, as well as being over two hours long. A modern comedy wouldn't take long to get down to business, but this movie takes its time; for example, Dudley Moore doesn't get down to Mexico to crash the honeymoon of his dream girl until almost half the movie has passed. But the movie never gets so slow that it's boring, and Moore does give a likable comic performance. Not one of the best comedies ever made, but perfect when you want to kick back and be lightly amused for a couple of hours.",10
12,AaronCapenBanner,"Film Title Refers To Bo Derek, Not Itself!",4,6 September 2013,"Bo Derek became a huge star as the perfectly cast ""10"" of the title, a young woman named Jenny on her honeymoon, who is relentlessly pursued by an older man(played by Dudley Moore) who is fascinated by her. She gets to know him better when he saves her new husband's life, after he falls asleep and nearly drowns off the beaches of Mexico. She is grateful to him, and learns that his name is George Webber, a composer who has recently turned 42, and already has a girlfriend(played by Julie Andrews). She has an open relationship with her husband, and doesn't mind fulfilling George's fantasy about her once...Though portrayed as shallow, I found Jenny the only thing about this dreary, self-indulgent, and overlong film that is worth watching. Not that funny either, despite Dudley Moore's repeated pratfalls. The most I can rate this film is a ""4"".",10
13,Wuchakk,Going back in time to 1978,7,10 September 2014,"Released in 1979, ""10"" is about George Webber (Dudley Moore), a Hollywood composer having a mid-life crisis who rashly decides to follow his dreamgirl (Bo Derek) to a Mexican resort where she's on her honeymoon. Julie Andrews plays his girlfriend, Robert Webber his gay friend in the business, Brian Dennehy his bartender in Mexico and Dee Wallace a potential one-night-stand. ""10"" is more of an amusing drama than a full-tilt comedy. Although there are pratfalls and 1-2 laugh-out-loud moments there are a lot of slow sequences that are extended shots in one take, which means the actors actually had to act. This is different today where the actors only have to act for each 10-second (or less) cut.What I like best about ""10"" is that it's like going back in time to 1978. I like Bo Derek but, despite her beautiful face and disposition, she's not actually a '10' in my humble opinion. She needs to gain at least 15 lbs as she's just too thin and unshapely. I'd take Dee Wallace over her any day. Julie Andrews appears with her hideous haircut. I kept thinking to myself, ""I bet she'd be beautiful with some nice locks of hair"" and later in the film it shows her in a play with a wig of long hair and -- sure enough -- she's gorgeous.BOTTOM LINE: ""10"" is a mildly amusing adult dramedy with numerous slow stretches, but it's highlighted by the 70's chic, quality locations, a handful of attractive women and a good message despite the debauchery. The film runs 122 minutes and was shot in Beverly Hills, Malibu, L. A., Pasadena, CA, and Manzanillo, Colima, MexicoGRADE B",10
14,Red-Barracuda,Pretty funny and its got Bo Derek,7,7 October 2021,"I remember seeing Tarzan the Ape Man on telly when I was 11 - the version with Bo Derek as Jane - that was a pretty interesting experience for a young lad that's for sure! So, even though I know perfectly well that she is an awful actress, I instantly give Bo a pass every time. 10 was her first main role in a movie and was famous in its day primarily for her appearance which instantly made her the top sex symbol of the 80's. The story has Dudley Moore's character go through a mid-life crisis leading him to secretly follow a gorgeous young woman (Bo). He winds up improbably going to bed with her and only then decides it's a bad idea and she should also behave better herself (the patronising, hypocritical, clueless, as well as deeply misguided, chump!). Despite playing a bit of a bell-end, Moore is pretty funny in this it has to be said - there's a fair bit of slapstick, as well as comedy-of-manners, both of which he does well. Julie Andrews is also on good form as his long-suffering partner. Overall, an enjoyable combo of rom-com, sex comedy and slapstick, with a little bit of dramatic reality and Bo Derek, underpinning it all.",10
15,disdressed12,"if you don't like gratuitous nudity,you'll wan't to avoid this movie",6,18 September 2010,"Blake Edwards directed this romantic comedy starring Dudley Moore and Julie Andrews.there's a lot of of nudity in the film all of it gratuitous,so if you if that's something that bothers you,you might want to avoid this one.without giving too much away, a lot of the comedy(though not all of it)revolves around the main character being drunk and acting silly.and there is some physical comedy as well.and i have admit,i laughed out loud a number of times.but i also thought a few of the comedic bits fell flat.the movie was also somewhat predictable and a bit too long,in my opinion.overall,though i found it entertaining enough to pass the time.for me,10 is 6/10",10
16,sddavis63,"""10"" Gets A ""5"" From Me",5,3 July 2017,"""10"" is not an unpleasant movie to watch. It has several humorous moments, a largely likable cast and a good performance - frankly, I thought it was the best of the movie - from Julie Andrews, in a role that pushed her far beyond what her fans would have been used to seeing her in - fare such as ""The Sound Of Music"" or ""Mary Poppins."" You could even say that it's an interesting reflection on middle age. But at the same time there's an uncomfortable quality to this movie; it has a bit of ""creepiness"" to it that made this less than fully enjoyable.Dudley Moore played George Webber - a music composer who's just celebrated his 42nd birthday and who finds himself dissatisfied with life. He has everything a man could realistically want. He's successful in his career, he has friends and he seems to have all the toys, and he has Samantha (Andrews), his quite beautiful girlfriend who he frustrates with his inability (or refusal) to emotionally connect. For all that he has, George comes across as sad and lonely, and in spite of the fact that he should be very happy (what more does he need?) he becomes suddenly infatuated with a bride (Bo Derek) who he spies when her limo stops at a red light beside his car. To him, she's the perfect ""10"" on a scale of 1-10 (hence, the movie's name.) It was this infatuation that gave the movie it's creepy feel (although the arrangement he apparently had with a guy to spy on each other with telescopes - which gave the move much of its mildly erotic feel - also added to that.) In spite of the fact that Jenny is just married, George's infatuation turns into pursuit - you could even call it stalking. He goes out of his way to find out who she was and where she went on her honeymoon, follows her there, claims a spot beside her on the beach (all the better to ogle her from), and manages to save her husband's life for no other reason it seems than to get her into bed with him. In my view, the whole thing could have been done in a way that would have been more consistent with this being the romantic comedy that most people think of it as. It certainly has its sensitive moments (and the requisite happy ending as George seems to overcome his mid-life crisis) and, as I said, it is humorous at times, but that whole plot just gave this a very heavy and uneasy feel to me.Andrews, as I said, was the highlight of the movie for me. She has a couple of opportunities to display her vocal talents and she just comes across as a very lovely woman whose character is understandably hurt by George's dissatisfaction with their relationship. Moore was Moore. I've never been a huge fan. He played the part well. Derek? Well, in all honesty she's not an actress who's ever really turned my head and her career - while it's been lengthy - hasn't really been filled with major successes either. Frankly, she was cast as a body in this movie. The first hour and a half goes by with her getting her share of screen time but literally no dialogue at all. Once she gets dialogue - she's competent enough, but her character turns out to be not very likable.It's not a bad movie. It was easy to get through and I never turned away from it. It has a fair bit of relatively innocent nudity, a lot of drinking and some drugs. To be honest, I'm not sure exactly what it was that made this movie such a hit among audiences and reviewers. I'd consider it quite over-rated. It's not a 10. It's a 5 out of 10.",10
17,ThomasDrufke,It's Easy to Say,6,26 September 2017,"""10"" is far from a masterpiece, in fact, it's much more of a goofy 70's rom-com than anything else, but there's a little bit more heart and quite a few more laughs than I thought there would be here. The film is about a man (played by Dudley Moore) going through a mid-life crisis as he realizes his age is creeping up on him as he's failing to provide a spark in his relationship with the one and only Julie Andrews. What follows feels like a movie made specifically for sexually deprived teenagers, but there's definitely a little bit more to it than that. George Webber (Moore) is a film composer recognized by everyone for his famous ballads, but he rarely shares an intimate moment with people for various reasons. Spending his nights desperate to find his music again and spying on his neighbor who consistently hosts sex parties, there's not a lot going for Webber. But when he stumbles upon a young newly married woman, things begin to change. The actual plot itself isn't the most interesting, especially as it consistently meanders into slapstick comedy. I mean, George literally has a mid-day fantasy of Bo Derek slowly running on a beach Baywatch style for over a minute. It's not exactly the most tightly written or directed feature. However, I did at least connect to the Webber character in part. His relationship to Andrews is touching at times, and I have a special place in my heart for film composers. Henry Mancini's score is another gem and it's definitely a film that can be enjoyed in the background if you turn your brain off for a few hours.6.4/10",10
18,lesleyharris30,"Blake Edwards' Most Grounded, Least Zany Creation,",7,18 August 2017,"10 is a good movie with a reasonably well developed plot and a cast that shine in both comedic and dramatic moments. It is certainly not a typical Blake Edwards movie, from creations such the Pink Panther films and The Party, what we have come to expect from this man is zany, madcap comedies. Here, however, he brings us a very grounded comedy that studies its characters and the effects ageing can have on our mentalities. Bringing this story and these characters to life is Dudley Moore and Julie Andrews, both delivering layered, complicated performances with subtle nuances throughout. I did find this movie to be far longer than it needed to be. Running at two hours, it gets carried away with its simple message and drags on. One of the most appealing aspects of this movie, something that drags people in, is to see the relationship develop between Moore and Bo Derek, but the two never end up interacting until more than an hour in. I just feel it could have been a lot more fun if it moved a little quicker. It was very difficult to sympathize with George Webbler in any way, he is an unkind, self centred man who we are never given a reason to truly support. I understand that what he is doing is wrong anyway, and it is not trying to be portrayed as a wise decision, but the character should have had some good qualities if we are going to follow him for 120 minutes. Grounded, as well as slow moving. Subtle humour and containing two actors delivering some of their best work, Ten is not exceptional, but it is enjoyable, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy, particularly to fans of the great Blake Edwards. After he reaches forty, a settled composer has a midlife crisis and begins to desire a newly married woman. Best Performance: Dudley Moore",10
19,atlasmb,An Affable Classic,9,25 June 2015,"Having never been a fan of Blake Edwards, nevertheless I had to see this film when it came out in 1979. It was one of those ""it"" movies due to the buzz surrounding its release (like ""The Exorcist"" or ""Jaws""). The mystique was about the young woman who played the titular role. What or who was a real ""10""--the embodiment of female perfection? It was Bo Derek who famously played Jenny, the object of Dudley Moore's middle-age fascination. The film put both of them on the map. Though Dudley was known for ""Foul Play"", ""10"" made him a household name in America.The film also placed two other items in the public consciousness. After the film, Bo's hairstyle became a (somewhat unfortunate) fashion trend. And Ravel's Bolero became known as music to make love to.The film is well written and well made. It also features some nice performances by Brian Dennehy, as an affable bartender, and Dee Wallace (an under-rated actress) as Moore's failed one night stand. Julie Andrews--wife of Blake Andrews--plays the woman Moore leaves at home while on his tropical getaway.But the story centers around Moore's obsession with Bo and the surprising outcome of that relationship. The film may not be a ""10"", but it gets high marks.",10
20,pmtelefon,Overlong but worth the watch.,7,19 June 2019,"I saw ""10"" in the theater (Bellerose, NY) when I was fifteen years old. I later saw it a hundred times on WHT (early Queens, NY cable). ""10"" has a lot of nudity and some laughs so there was no way I wouldn't watch it when it was on. All that said, ""10"" is okay at best. It's too long and too ""serious"" at times. It has a more than a few laughs but Blake Edwards beats a few of them to death. How times did he think we would laugh at jokes about hot sand? On the plus side, Dudley Moore gives a nice performance and is surrounded by a very strong supporting cast. ""10"" may have been one of Blake Edwards biggest hits but it's not one of his top five movies.",10
21,jadavix,Monsier Hulot gets horny,7,16 February 2019,"""10"" is, at times, hilarious. It shows that Dudley Moore was a master of physical comedy - check out the scenes where he tries to function after the dentist visit but before the novocaine wears off, and him trying to walk across hot sand on the beach.I think the movie could have been more than that, though. It could have actually made you think about ageing, mid life crises, youth, etc. Maybe Blake Edwards wasn't up to it.You probably already know the plot, but I'll spell it out anyway: a middle aged composer becomes smitten with a young woman he sees getting married and follows her to the beach, leaving his wife behind.What you may not know is that this story hardly seems to matter to the movie. It is more ""about"" Dudley Moore as a hapless man just trying to get through his day-to-day affairs. It reminded me of the French movie, ""Monsieur Hulot's Holiday"". I was also surprised by the amount of sex and nudity in the movie. For some reason the protagonist lives across the way from a scummy hippie type whose abode is frequented by nude models.In the movie's climax (no pun intended), I felt the movie kind of edging around a real revelation about growing older. Edwards didn't underline the point strongly enough; but then the movie is too long, and baggy, like it couldn't decide whether to be a silly comedy or a rumination on middle age. It could actually have been both, in the hands of a better director.",10
22,ianlouisiana,"""Chinese food and women-there is nothing else"" Dudley Moore.",3,14 November 2006,"Mr Dudley Moore,former Magdalen College Oxford Organ Scholar,parlayed a successful career in big time movies via a talent for self-deprecating humour and what was perceived,particularly in the U.S. as his typical ""Englishness""which was in fact the veneer of middle class charm and mannerisms acquired over three years at a University where,in 1954 when he went up,a large proportion of his fellow students would have considered him vastly their social inferior. He was born on a council estate in Dagenham and grew up speaking what is now referred to as ""Estuary English""(think David Beckham),and so was a rare bird indeed in early fifties Oxford.However,his prodigious musical talent and his eagerness to please won him many friends and admirers. Armed with his degree he took up a career as a jazz pianist,later turning to musical satire before teaming up with fellow Oxbridge men,Miller,Cook and Bennett for ""Beyond the Fringe"" which catapulted him to world fame. Several TV series with the clever but increasingly unstable Peter Cook followed before his movie debut in Bryan Forbes idiosyncratic ""The Wrong Box"". By 1979 and ""10"" his film career was hitting its peak;a pity then that ""10"" is quite simply pretty poor stuff. Mr Moore mugs,he gags,he pratfalls,he does his renowned drunk act,but to little avail.There is no discipline in his performance,he hits the ground running right at the start of the movie and finds himself with nowhere to go after twenty minutes.The way Mr Blake Edwards directs him might persuade you that he would have preferred his old sparring partner Mr Peter Sellers in the role,he,at least,would have paced himself,left a little bit in reserve.Mrs Blake Edwards appears a little apprehensive and keeps her distance while Mr Moore cavorts across the screen gleefully like a schoolboy on the first day of the summer holiday. Miss Bo Derek has little to do except look goddess-like,and where she tries to do that little she fails. The lovely Dee Wallace has a rather thankless part,but,together with Mr Brian Dennehy,manages to steal the movie from under the noses of all the big names. Mr Moore went on to make ""Arthur"",which was funnier,and ""Arthur 2"",which wasn't.After that he accepted fewer parts,preferring to write and play music simply for fun,which he was doing almost up until his tragically early death. Having said all that,I firmly believe that if the 19 year old Dudley Moore,getting off the train at Oxford for the first time,his new music case stuffed with the works of Byrd,Tallis,Britten and Stanford,had been asked if he would rather have a relatively short life filled with wine,women,song,world movie stardom and adulation or die as a dried up 90 year old Academic with a portfolio of obscure sacred music the answer would have been a resounding ""Yes please"".",10

Apart from feeling of admiration found in men as well as women,Blake Edwards' 10 tells that there is a voyeur in all of us.It is because of this voyeur that there is also a mad man in all of us.In the film,it is British actor Dudley Moore who plays both parts with reckless abandon.",10

Big thing made of Bo Derek's appearance but the movie has a better moral message than you would think.

27,MarieGabrielle,Has not aged well...,5,17 February 2008,"No, not Bo Derek, but the film itself. Trite and too early 80's, the decade of materialism and shallow lifestyles. ""Poverty Sux"" was the motto and in true fashion Blake Edwards made a film about your not so typical middle aged man in his midlife crisis.So unreal as he lives in Malibu with his current girlfriend Julie Andrews (such a strange pairing. Well, she was Edwards' wife, so I guess that means the audience must buy it).At any rate, there is the usual trip to Las Hadas, slapstick by Dudley Moore, and general idiocy. Bo Derek looks great. Thats about it. Skip it and watch ""The Brothers McMullen"" instead. 5/10.",10
28,Movie-ManDan,A Sex Farce Done Right!,10,16 January 2019,"Blake Edwards is best known for two things: directing the 'Pink Panther' movies and sex farce films. And most that know the general premises of some of the latters will likely be turned off. See them more than once and look below the surface of the storyline. '10' is about a middle-age man seeking a beautiful woman just because she is so gorgeous. That is a copout of a simplification.Award-winning Hollywood composer George Webber (Dudley Moore) just turned 42 and is already feeling the blues of his age. It puts a strain on the relationship with his actress-girlfriend (Edwards' own wife Julie Andrews). One day driving, after seeing a slew of hot women, he sees sex goddess Bo Derek on her way to her wedding. Him following her is one of the many gags plagued throughout this romp. He is asked what she is on a scale to ""10"" with him answering ""11."" Desperate to find out who this girl is, he goes to the reverend who leads him to her dentist father who then leads him to Mexico where she is on her honeymoon. This whole time, we feel for George. He is on a journey to something he does not know, but is determined to get there. When he arrives in Mexico, it is paradise. The viewer feels greatness and vibrancy with the setting. He sees Derek and is more nervous than before. He finally gets the chance to meet her after saving her husband who is hospitalized. Will he like her as he hopes?'10' reminded me of 'American Beauty': both deal with middle-aged men who become infatuated with girls a fraction their ages whom they do not know. Obviously 'American Beauty' is far superior, but '10' also hits many right notes too. It has the perfect balance of humour and heartbreak with such a complex story. Well, the man is complex. It is just an infatuation. It is going to blow over. But first he needs to know what it is that he is getting himself into before he can move on from this beauty.'10' fits so perfectly as a midlife crisis film and a romantic comedy. It even fits well as an adventure film of self discovery.Don't miss this! Highly recommended!4/4",10
29,mhorg2018,Overrated and dated,1,2 July 2018,"Would this movie even be remembered if it weren't for Bo Derek? Let's face it she simply isn't that good of an actress, and perhaps should never be allowed to emote on screen. Dudley is funny as usual, but this just isn't a great movie.",10
30,hall895,"Bo may be a 10, movie's closer to a 1",2,16 July 2013,"Dudley Moore plays George Webber, a successful composer who's got a good life. He's got money, a fancy house, a nice car and a great girlfriend played by Julie Andrews. But George is not happy. He's having a rather pathetic midlife crisis and just wants to score with some hot young babe. Enter Jenny, played by Bo Derek. She's a 10 and George wants her. Unfortunately for him the first time he sees her she's in the back of a car on her way to the church to be married. George crashes her wedding. Things which are meant to be funny happen there but they're not funny at all. And thus is set the tone for the whole movie. It tries to be funny and it fails miserably at it.Even the worst comedies usually have a few decent laughs sprinkled throughout. Not this one. There's not a laugh to be found. All the jokes and gags fall flat. All of them. What's worse is the way the movie painstakingly sets its gags up. You can see what's going to happen before it does. And you think, ""They're not really going to do that are they? That won't be funny at all."" And then inevitably, yes they do it at which point all you can do is groan. All the supposedly funny moments are telegraphed and none of them are actually funny. One bit with a crippled old tea lady goes on forever and may be the most painfully unfunny thing I've ever seen in any movie. Moore's character is completely unsympathetic. Jenny, the object of his desire, we never actually get to spend any time with until late on in the movie. Sadly we then find that while she may have a million-dollar body she has a 10-cent head. You feel sorry for poor Julie Andrews who is really slumming it by appearing in this dreck. She gives the movie whatever very little dignity it has. Never, no matter how bad a movie is, have I ever stopped watching it before it was over. This is as close as I've ever come to doing so. An absolutely excruciating movie to sit through. They should have spent less money on Bo Derek's hairstylist and more on getting a decent script.",10

I was never allowed to watch this and it is not until now that i have got the chance to see it and my over riding thought is,Boy do kids exagerate!. This film is decribed in the listings as a sex comedy yet i found ""10"" lacking in both of those ingredients. While at times this has it's funny moments thanks to Dudley Moore , they are few and far between and as for the sex part well i have seen more sex in a Charlie Chaplin movie! In a way this film is quite depressing , Dudley Moore slowly drinks himself to death (a bit like real life)while moaning that he is too old, yet he manages to pull the beautifull Bo Derek after following her and her new husband all the way to Mexico. yet when gets her into bed he moans that she is cheating on her Husband and walks out! You Fool! The most depressing thing that happens is that poor old Dud ends up with his old Flame julie Andrews who to me ,is as sexy as most people's grandmother, even when she was 18. Over all ""10"" has it moments but it is far too long and far too depressing. 5 out of 10",10
32,TOMASBBloodhound,Confessions of middle-age.,7,28 February 2010,"This Blake Edwards sex farce probably serves as his apology to his wife Julie Andrews for occasionally letting younger women catch his eye. It happens to all of us, unless we are somehow rich or famous. The younger women we still crave are just not into us older guys. But that's life. And it serves as a dilemma for Dudley Moore's George Webber character. His is a successful, yet undeniably aging composer who just turned 42. He seems to have a lot going for him including a wonderful girlfriend his age (Andrews), a fancy home in a swinging neighborhood, and a nice Rolls Royce. But one day while out on a drive, he catches the eye of a beautiful young bride-to-be on the way to her wedding. Webber then spends the majority of the film lusting after her.This film is a bit uneven when you break it down, but more often than not it succeeds. The laughs here come from Dudley Moore doing John Ritter style physical comedy. I do believe the show Three's Company was popular back then. The story on the other hand moves a bit too slowly than you'd hope. The material here just doesn't warrant a two-hour running time. The script does throw in some surprises here and there, mostly after Moore has located the girl in Mexico. And there he learns that the gap in their ages is dwarfed by their gap in values. It was a nice revelation.The acting is quite good here. Moore is delightful and his relationship with Andrews allows her to shine as well. Robert Webber takes a surprising turn as a gay songwriter partner of Moore's. The two seem to have the kind of relationship Bernie Taupin might have shared with Elton John. Its interesting to see what Brian Dennehy was up to before getting type-cast as the ""macho man"". Bo Derek wasn't the greatest actress, but she is a joy to behold in a physical sense. And she really gets very little screen time, anyway. Yes, the film looks quite dated, but the California of that time was infinitely more magical than the illegal immigrant and gang infested Kaleeforneea of today. All in all I'd say this film is worth about 7 of 10 stars.The Hound.",10
33,Isaac5855,My Favorite Dudley Moore Performance,8,2 December 2005,"Though he will probably always be remembered for 1981's ARTHUR, my favorite Dudley Moore performance is still from the 1979 Blake Edwards classic ""10"". Moore plays George Webber, a man who seemingly has it all: a flourishing career as a songwriter, money, a gorgeous home, an equally gorgeous girlfriend (Julie Andrews), but still feels like something is missing in his life. Then one day, while stopped at a traffic signal, he glances at a girl (Bo Derek)in a limo, on her way to her wedding. George becomes obsessed with this vision, this perfect ""10"" and forsakes everything in his life, including Andrews, to find and be with this woman. After getting six fillings drilled by the girl's dentist/father (James Noble), in an attempt to learn where the girl went on her honeymoon, George flies to Mexico to find his ""10"" and eventually learns the lessons you would expect from such a venture. In addition to some great physical comedy offered by Moore, there are moments of great warmth here too. The scenes at the outdoor bar in Mexico where Dudley encounters a lonely woman (Dee Wallace) and plays the piano are lovely. Brian Dennehy is effectiveLY cast against type as the bartender. Also cast against type is Robert Webber as George's gay songwriting partner who tries in vain to make George see what an idiot he is and appreciate the things he has. This IS not just a smarmy sex comedy, but a warm character study of a man chasing something he really doesn't want or need and features one of Dudley Moore's most charming performances.",10
34,LebowskiT1000,"Good movie, but nothing great.",8,29 July 2002,"There have been countless references to this film in so many films that I've seen, so I thought it was in my best interest to see this film.  I wouldn't say that this film was anything terribly great, but it's ok. 
The story is basically about a guy who goes through a mid-life crisis and has to decide what is important in his life.  The story is nothing terribly complicated and has some really good comedy along the way.  Although I have to say that the story is paced rather slowly and I kept looking at the time as I watched the film, but it picks up pretty well at the end of the film.Everyone in the cast does a great job.  Dudley Moore does a fine job, as does Julie Andrews, Brian Dennehy, Dee Wallace and Bo Derek.  I've got to say that they chose the perfect person to play Jenny Miles, because Bo Derek is most definitely a perfect ""10""!I thought ""10"" was a good movie, nothing special.  I would recommend watching the movie, mainly because so many other films have references to it, but there's no need to run out and see it as soon as possible.  I hope you enjoy the film.  Thanks for reading.-Chris",10
35,hokeybutt,A Very Melancholy Comedy,8,23 January 2005,"""10"" (4 outta 5 stars) Kind of weird seeing this movie again after 20 years. When I first saw it I was just a kid in my early 20s and now I am older than the character Dudley Moore plays in this movie... a cranky, disillusioned composer going through a mid-life crisis. Dang, I never had one of those at 40... does this mean I'm overdue? Anyway, flawed as this movie is, it is still a classic. It's generally considered a ""comedy"" but the most effective scenes are the quieter, more melancholy scenes. (The scene where Moore plays the piano in the bar for Dee Wallace gets me every time.) This is probably the best role of Moore's career... he's able to come across as sympathetic even while acting like a jerk for most of the movie. It's the supporting performances by Julie Andrews, Dee Wallace, Robert Webber and Brian Dennehy that really give the movie its depth. Thankfully, Bo Derek doesn't really have to do any acting, so she doesn't throw the movie too much out of whack. The movie seems a lot sadder to me these days... though I thought it was hysterically funny 25 years ago.",10
36,roghache,Middle aged male sexual fantasies do not merit a 10,1,22 March 2006,"I seldom give a rating of 1 but this movie wholeheartedly earned it. Its plot (such as it is) revolves around a 40 something year old man named George, who is in some sort of sexual mid life crisis, wanting to feel young, attractive, and virile again. He finds that his beautiful and intelligent girlfriend, Samantha (Julie Andrews) is inadequate in eliciting such feelings. He thus fantasizes over a young, perfectly proportioned bride named Jenny (Bo Derek) and becomes rather pathetically obsessed.Indeed, this entire movie is rather pathetic. Where to begin?How about the cast? George is played by Dudley Moore, whom I loved in Arthur. Woody Allen, the master neurotic, might have been a more suitable choice. Julie Andrews is one of my favorite actresses, whether singing (Sound of Music etc.) or drama (The Tamarind Seed). It is unbelievable that she stooped to the level of this supposedly erotic drivel. I guess she was attempting at the time to dispense with her goody goody image and project mature sexiness. Also, I believe she is married to this sorry film's director, Blake Edwards. As for Bo Derek, yes, she has a perfect body and those braids became a legend. Nothing more of note here regarding her. She's simply a body in this movie.The entire theme of this middle aged idiot's sexual fantasies would, frankly, have been better left unexplored. The concept of males rating females on a scale from 1 to 10 (Jenny gets an 11) is neither a novel one nor something to be encouraged. Of course this film made an art form out of the practice. Where was the outcry from the feminists at the time? Pity also, the desecration of Ravel's Bolero. Perhaps Maurice Ravel, its composer, intended the work to be sexy (privately), perhaps not. I'm not that familiar with him. However, it is a magnificent composition and I can hardly believe that Ravel ever meant it as cinematic accompaniment to George and Jenny's bedding. Poor Ravel. I suspect he might be spinning in his grave.That about does it. I've already wasted far too much time just watching this movie, best not to waste any more writing about it. Suffice it to say, I can think of few films less deserving of their fame.",10
37,rlcsljo,Kind of a defining movie for the eighties,7,1 January 2001,"The seventies were kind of a transition period between the sixties and seventies (lame!) in the American movies in the following sense.  In the seventies, soft core porn was making stars out of unknowns, but for the most part ""major"" stars stayed away from it.  But, after the porno industry started to turn the film business on its ear (cheap to produce, made big bucks), the ""established"" studios, at the behest of money hungry conglomerates, began to sit up and take notice.Although much has been mentioned about Bo Derek, Julie Andrews played the quintessential ""brassy broad with balls"", in this film.  Although I was obviously impressed with Ms Derek's form the thing that stood out in my mind was watching ""Mary Poppins"" giving someone the finger!  I think this inspired many great actresses of the time to ""break the mold"" and try different more challenging roles.I also think this is the first film from a major studio to use established porn stars, although in the background.This was a major leap in film making on par with ""Shampoo""",10

It might just be the best role any of them have done acting wise. The great Brian Dennehy was wonderful here as always as were Dee Wallace and many other supporting cast actors. The direction was by the infamous Blake Edwards who also wrote and he has his moments in film history, but his direction was only so-so here but that works fine for a love story.This is in fact a love story, a drama about life, lust and love and it has some very funny moments in it. I thought it was a comedy and although 30 years old, this was my first time seeing it. It had too much drama for me and too little laughs.I can see why people like it and would say its a good film, but my ratings are based on how I feel about it and in doing so I could only give it a 3. I didn't love it, didn't hate it, it was a tad too long and had too much lovey dovey crap for my taste. I will also never want to see it again, and a movie that is not re-watchable usually gets low ratings from me.",10

After the party and a good night sleep, George gets up an goes to the local club. George is a songwriter and likes to go to the club to play the piano. After playing the piano, George gets in his car and starts for home. While sitting at a stop sign, George looks over to the car next to him where he sees a beautiful blonde-haired woman in the back sit of a Royce with her wedding gown on. George decides he's going to follow the Royce to see where it's going. Every turn the Royce made, George would make the same turn. When the Royce stops at a local church, George decides to go around it and hits a police car head on in the process. So now, George has to try to explain to the officer why he was driving like that. After hearing George explanation, he decides to give George a ticket anyway. George is given a ticket for the following, an expire drivers license, no registration, no insurance and wreck less driving. So after the police leave George pulls his car of the road and tries to sneak into the church to see the wedding. While hiding near the flowers so no one could him, a bee crawls up his nose and he gets stung and knocks over the flowers. Therefore, after the day he has had, he gets into his car and heads for home. After having a couple of drinks, George goes out onto his porch to look in his telescope. Now most people have telescopes to look at the stars, however, George uses his for looking across the grounds into other people's bedroom. Therefore, George and Samantha get into bed and start to talk when George uses the word broad. After getting into an argument about the word instead of spending the night Samantha gets her stuff and heads home leaving George to spend the night alone. The next day George has to go to the dentist to get work done on his mouth. After several hours in the dentist chair, the dentist gives George a prescription for pain pills. The problem George has is he also has cotton in his mouth and can't talk right. Therefore, Samantha calls a couple of times and when George answers the phone, she can't understand what he's saying so she keeps hanging up on him. So after several more tries Samantha calls the police to go to George house to check on him. In the mean time, George has been mixing his pain pills with his scotch and by the time, the police get to George house he's feeling no pain at all. After things continue to go wrong, George calls a travel agent and makes a trip to go to Aural Mexico. After his plane lands and being as drunk as a skunk, George goes straight to his room an passes out. After sleeping of his scotch, George goes to the lounge for a cup of much needed coffee; the bride he saw in the car comes over and sits down beside him. Now things are going off the wall and George doesn't no what to do next. Here's some extra news and notes about this film. George Segal was suppose to play the role of George Webber but walked off the set shortly after production started. The song that was being played during the love scene with Dudley Moore and Bo Derek was titled Ravel's, which means Bolero. Later in Bo Derek's career she would star in a movie titled Bolero, which hit the screen in 1984. Although this movie's title was widely understood to say that Bo Derek's looks rated 10 out of 10, the rating actually given to her character's looks in the scene where the subject arises is 11 out of 10.My Thoughts: However, I don't think that Bo Derek should have been cast for this role. There were several actresses that I think could have fill the role a lot better. Raquel Welch would have looked good running down a beach in a one-piece suit. In addition, Lynda Carter, Rosa Blasi, and Jaclyn Smith would have filled the role far better then Bo Derek. When you talk about all three actresses Lynda, Raquel, Rosa, and Jaclyn are far more then tens and would have made the movie a lot better. Therefore, the weasel stars I can give this movie is 8",10

To feel attractive and desired by beautiful young girls. The predicaments George Weber gets himself in during his pursuit are hilarious. When he continuously slips down the hill outside his LA hills home with a swollen dental issue it's difficult not to bust. The film touches on the Free Wheeling Hedonist ways of many Californians and finds solace in a more structure relationship. Bo Derek says: "" I don't know what your problem is but I don't think you are going to solve it by trying to solve mine and I don't think I have problem"" To which Dudley Moore replies: ""That's your problem."" It's a pivotal moment of recognizing reality verses fantasy.The film recognizes that Men are weak and give into lust one too many times.It is a growing experience. Men are afraid to grow up.

When Bo Derek, on her way to her wedding, turns her head to look at Dudley Moore, a tremendous feeling overcomes the senses. She is extraordinary! Then, when we see Bo Derek enter a Hotel Cabana Bar sporting those beaded braids and wearing that white dress...the effect is powerful as she projects the image of a perfect 10. Then, to a Mexico Beach where her presence is very rewarding. When she opens her eyes in that close up it is a tribute to beauty and desire. Dudley Moore is obsessed. Julie Andrews is sexy on the other end of the pole. The gay undertones are well touched upon. Surprisingly fun.....It is a surprise they have not made 10, The Man...just add the male symbol to the 0.",10
44,johnmbale,Really its 6 out of 10 !,6,13 November 2005,"This film was really a vehicle for Dudley Moore (Cuddly Dudley) when he was at the peak of his career, along with the opportunity to display the obvious charms of Bo Derrick, who spends much of her time on the screen smoldering or preening. As a rather not so obscure object of desire, Bo is more model than actress. A laborious comedy at best, certainly below Blake Edwards best standards, a few funny moments, (as with the old girl and the tray) but a great deal of boring stuff in between. No doubt Moore's fans in the 70's were impressed, and he is a lovable character, especially when he plays being tipsy, but there is not enough meat in the sandwich this time.",10
45,Gatorman9,Don't misunderstand this film,7,11 July 2020,"I debated writing a review of this film until I read quite a number of others and realized the negative ones generally seem to have come from people who didn't understand it.When at least many, many guys are pretty young a girl is very typically something very, very exciting, but as the years roll on that kind of feeling steadily diminishes. By the time you are, say, 42, this may have reached the point that, just as you can look at a recent picture and see just how far your hairline has receded in the past two decades (and just how far your belt line has done the opposite), you may get an opportunity to suddenly discover just how far those feelings have declined when unexpectedly you see somebody that suddenly reawakens that excitement. For the first time in literally ages, you instantly feel not just better, but vastly better, the best you have since you graduated from college. That's what happens to George Webber (Dudley Moore) in this movie, and what others dismiss simplistically as an ""obsession"" or ""middle-aged lust"" (whatever that could possibly be) is the simple fact that he suddenly feels a lot more alive again than he has in many, many years.So, naturally he pursues this. In reality, it's not about lust, but one character's Ponce de Leon story, where in fact, as far as he feels, he has actually discovered a fountain of youth. But alas, just as with Ponce de Leon, there is no such thing. Reality rears its ugly head when the awesome power of the imagination is overwhelmed by the plain reality of actual life, and as soon as the starry image inspired by the pretty form of his supposed object is dissolved by the stark fact of an actual encounter, the whole thing is revealed as an illusion in his mind, and he is left to deal with what he has rather than what his imagination had briefly teased him with instead.The good news is that somehow out of this he emerges at least rejuvenated enough to make amends with his real life and get back to more promising personal business, as I suppose anyone would do who doesn't wind up doing themselves to death with drink or worse.The tale is a Blake Edwards one which means it has to be told as a ""bedroom"" farce, with plenty of the usual kind humor you would expect from that source, and from Dudley Moore himself, as well. Being as it was made in 1979, Edwards probably had little choice but to push the envelope further than he would have in OPERATION PETTICOAT (his first such venture, in 1959), lest too large a chunk of the self-styled and only allegedly ""cool"" people in the late 70's audience pan it as old-fashioned. In this vein he and his leading lady and own wife Julie Andrews were expected to aggressively shed her Mary Poppins image, however ridiculous that effort might seem 40 years later. But the viewer has to remember those days to understand the impetus for this; even theretofore gentle sweetheart singer Olivia Newton-John was doing the same thing in the same time frame as a gushing entertainment press exalted her ""new image"". Against that backdrop the modern viewer needs to cut Edwards, et al., some slack.This movie has a lot of very funny humor, both situational and physical, and if I had any complaint about it, it was that the dialog seemed somewhat lazy, not at all as witty as what was needed to get a really first-class effort. But unlike a pure comedy, it also had a very serious side that can wear on a viewer if you can identify with it too well. In that regard, in some ways it is not far from a tragedy at times. And as at least one other perceptive reviewer here has noted, the pacing is a bit leisurely, something that becomes more prominent with repeat viewings. And finally, I guess it would be out of place not to mention that if the movie is about a ""10"", then they found the ideal figure to play her in Bo Derek, who was a rare, even unique, knockout among women seen on the screen in the Hollywood of that era. Her physical appearance lent an ethereal quality necessary to make her believable as George Webber's fantasy woman that the average beautiful actress normally does not have. The bottom line is, given all these considerations I gave it a 7/10, meaning that if you get a chance to see it, I don't recommend passing it up.",10
46,LeroyBrown-2,Entertaining although a little heavy handed and full of '70s cliché,7,27 February 2008,"I remember when I was 18 I went to the theater twice to see this movie a total of 4 times. Bo Derek was a ten back then and still a lovely woman today. This movie was described back then as a movie about a man's mid-life crisis. I suppose in many ways it is about that but really it's also about lust pure and simple.The movie is about a middle age composer (Dudley Moore) in a long term committed relationship with a singer (Julie Andrews) who one day spies a very beautiful woman (Bo Derek) on her way to her wedding. He's so stunned by her that he wrecks his Rolls Royce. He finds out about her from the pastor who married the couple and then from her father. He follows her all the way to Mexico on her honeymoon, where he ends up fulfilling the classic male fantasy but being disappointed by it. In the end he realizes what he really wants.Blake Edwards directed the movie and it was sort of a comeback for him. After the failure of ""Darling Lili"", Mr. Edwards' hot career stalled and for the most part was sustained by the ""Pink Panther"" sequels. This movie brought his career back to life and he would have a series of successful movies into the '80s. It's also the epitome of the Blake Edwards comedies of the '80s, somewhat heavy handed, sprinkled with sight gags and slapstick comedy. The acting and the writing is more serious than need be. It makes you wonder what a director like Woody Allen and a writer like Neil Simon could have done with this concept.The acting is pretty good. This film was the big break for both Dudley Moore and Bo Derek. Credit must go to her and Mr. Edwards for creating not a clichéd air head but somebody who has a very modern opinion about sex. Julie Andrews well was basically Julie Andrews. There were two very good supporting roles, one played by Dee Wallace as a woman who's desperate for love and has an encounter with Dudley Moore. The other one Brian Dennehey as a wise bartender. I think it's also a big break for him. He shows in this performance the brilliance and presence that has sustained his career for 30 years now.The movie played up a couple of '70s cliché, the neighbor who has sex all the time and have sex parties (filled with porno stars from the '70s by the way). Casual drug use and the acceptance of casual sex. Overall I think it's an entertaining movie with a good cast but could easily have been better.Oh one footnote, Tanya Roberts was supposed to have been a finalist for the Bo Derek role but Mr. Edwards gave the role to Miss Derek the first time he saw her. Also the corn row hair do worked on her but failed on most other women. It was one of the great hairstyling disasters of all time for Caucasian women.",10
47,lynpalmer1,Unbelievably bad,1,28 June 2015,"I can't believe I wasted 2 hours watching this drivel. Have heard about this movie for years and just watched it for the first time. I shouldn't have bothered. Sad, pathetic, man with girlfriend spots his dream girl and decides to follow her on her honeymoon with hopes of getting lucky. Incredibly, he gets his chance, not only with her but also another woman.Even stupider, his girlfriend puts up with this jerk and takes him back when he decides he'll settle for her instead. Lucky girl! Women in the real world don't put up with this crap, not even in the 70's. Even more unbelievable is the man's even more homely neighbour that has a house load of different, naked women everyday. I know it's supposed to be a comedy, but come on!Also on that note, it is the saddest excuse for comedy I have ever seen. There is a mildly amusing song sung by a priest but Dudley Moore's' overacting in trying not to laugh ruins the moment.I can't recall any other humour in this drab story. Did I mention it is slow moving, unsexy and completely boring? There is not one likable,sympathetic character in the entire movie. Sexist, demeaning, pathetic, supposedly male fantasy movie.",10
48,arturopanduro,Good show!,7,21 November 2001,"Dudley Moore stars as George Webber, a man who sees the girl of his dreams (sexy Bo Derek as Jenny) outside the church she is about to be married in. He follows her on her honeymoon to Mexico, where he heroically rescues her new husband from death and is rewarded with a lot of attention from her. Well-written, well-acted, and beautifully photographed (mostly in Mexico), this is a timeless comedy from the great Blake Edwards. Also starring Julie Andrews as George's confused girlfriend Samantha, back home in Malibu.",10
49,Dock-Ock,10 Out Of 10,10,21 June 2001,"10 is everything i imagined it was going to be when i sat down to watch it. I have always loved Dudley Moore since childhood, particularly in the Arthur films, and this for me defines the best Dudley Moore characteristics-prat falls, drunkedness, sexual fantasies about younger women, Piano playing. I have also always been a big fan of Blake Edwards for the way he uses Laurel and Hardy movies as inspiration with slap stick [seen mainly in The Pink Panther movies with Peter Sellers] this time around we see a more sophisticated style to Edwards direction. Also with two beautiful women in the shape of Julie Andrews and Bo Derek, i was hopeful that the movie would come over as being very sexy. I was not disappointed.As well as representing all of the above things, the movie was extremely enjoyable. It is the epitomy of male fantasies. Ask yourself how many times you have fantasised about escaping to a desert island with a beautifull woman. In 10 Dud does just that. The movie comes over as being very exotic, and this blends with the hilarious performances, all the nudity and Henry Mancini's fantastic musical score. The movie is very funny and involving, one really identifies with Moore's performance as George Webber. Julie Andrews is great fun as Georges Love interest, and Bo Derek is fantastic as the girl of Dud's dreams-the perfect 10. And Blake deserves special credit for one of his most outstanding directorial works.A Winner. One that will stand the test of time.",10
50,chimera3,Not Even a 10,2,22 October 2017,"When I was a kid, we had all sorts of books on classic movies around our house. Of the many that piqued my interest then was ""10,"" for whatever the reason. Maybe it was seeing a young Bo Derek (who is a figure of Summerfest in Milwaukee, where I live) coming up from the sea. After my brother and I sat down to watch this some time later, it was very much of a let-down and wasn't even appropriately titled.Another Blake Edwards movie, it features Dudley Moore as a typical soul who falls into a mid-life crisis and questions his life choices. He has a great S.O. named Sam (Julie Andrews) who puts up with him every single day but doesn't mind it. One thing leads to another and he separates from her and goes down to Mexico to gather himself.He has a run-in with an old friend named Mary (Dee Wallace) and try to have some fun together, but it doesn't work. Then comes the iconic scene where he's on the beach and he runs across Jenny Miles (Bo Derek in her heyday). The two get to talking and they have a romantic night together; the only thing that Mr. Moore doesn't know about Jenny is that she's married. The straw that breaks the camel's back is when the two have a great night together and she gets a call from her husband. True to form, the two break it off and never speak to each other again. He then heads back to Sam to rekindle their relationship, which surprises her to no end.I would hardly call this a comedy. ""Victor Victoria"" was a comedy. Here it just seems like Dudley, Bo, and Julie were just phoning it in. Blake, too. This movie just drones on and on and is probably the inspiration for the later movie ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall."" Julie was in here for all of maybe 20-25 minutes, hardly worth a credit. Bo was in here for about the same time and not much of the focus was really on her, contrary to popular belief. The one who demanded the most attention was Dudley, who literally had to be in every single scene. In all fairness, that was hardly necessary.As I stated in my title, I wouldn't even call this ""10"" or give it a 10. It is a typical droning movie that has no real comedy. When it all comes down to it, it is just putting a real mid-life crisis to film and nothing more. This doesn't even belong in the same class as ""Victor Victoria"" or anything else that Blake may have done.",10
51,Tolbert,"Funny, Not Bad but Not Great either",6,19 July 2007,"I just saw this the other night for the first time. I'd always seen little bits and pieces of it but never the whole thing. The beach sequences were funny. Dudley Moore was his usual charming self. Having first seen him as Arthur and then this, Arthur was better.The Drunk bit was definitely a constant in both (at least to a small extent in this one). This is one of those movies where there's such a build-up to a certain event and then when it happens, it kind of leaves you cold.Julie Andrews is certainly talented both as an actress and as a singer. That woman can sing! But her character is rather irritating in this. She's so high-maintenance that you're really wishing for Dudley to dump her.Brian Dennehy's Part was my personal favorite. I love how Dudley plays off the whole ""I'm just having a drink with my old friend Don."" This is the kind of witty one-liners we've come to expect from Dudley.The only real negative things about this movie is that it drags in parts and then it just sort of ends in an anti-climatic manner.Oh Yeah, Bo Derek is Smokin Hot in this too!",10
52,JerryWeaver,Fabulous film,9,3 March 2002,"There is an old saying, ""Be careful of what you ask for, you might get it"". But men will be men, and when Dudley Moore sees the beautiful Bo Derek, he is compelled to follow her to Mexico.  I suspect most of us men have had the same impulse, though I doubt very many of us have taken it to the extreme that Dudley Moore does here.I could have done without the slapstick, and I didn't care for Julie Andrews as Moore's girlfriend.  One wonders why he would stay with such an unappealing woman, regardless of what happens with his pursuit of Bo Derek.But those annoyances aside, this is a wonderful film, full of good performances.  Brian Dennehy is great as the bartender; the scene in which Dudley Moore sits down and starts ordering doubles is wonderful. Dennehy plays the bartender to perfection, not volunteering too much information, but being accessible to the customer as needed, just like a good bartender is supposed to do.  And then after some rapport has been established, he does volunteer a nice compliment to Moore which the viewer is glad to hear.Moore, after all, is a lovable character, just like he was in Arthur"", and we root for him and want him to find whatever it is that will make him happy.  And his anguish is not limited to his urge to connect up with a beautiful young woman.  He is also anguished by the kind of music kids nowadays are listening to.  He realizes he is not at home in a culture in which a young couple can say that ""our song"" is ""Why Don't We Do It in the Road"".  Having reached this understanding, he can then understand also how he could never be happy with a woman half his age.",10
53,ConDeuce,Edwards' Best Film....,9,29 October 2010,"Blake Edwards' best film by far. This is the only time that he managed to almost perfectly balance his strengths and keep some of his poorer directorial habits at bay. Edwards can stage a comedy ""bit"" like few others can. Just check out his masterful bit of editing with the cars flying by on the LA roads after Sam Taylor has spied George at the swingers house (he's racing back to his house; she's racing away from it. The camera is poised on a hill simply panning left to right and right to left). Or the simple scene where George tumbles down the hill climbing desperately to get to the phone. There are a number of others in ""10"" that get a good laugh while staying realistic and true to the film's narrative. None of the comedy bits feel out of place the way they often do in some of Edwards' films (see ""Skin Deep"" for some examples of what I mean).Edwards is one of the most over looked directors. Some of the fault lies with his own inconsistencies. When he's in top form like in ""10"", he's fantastic. But a lot of times he allows himself to become self indulgent. Some of this self indulgence comes out of his apparent (and laudable) willingness to allow his stars to shine. In ""10"", for example, he gives his wife, Jule Andrews, a bit of singing to do while at a rehearsal. Thankfully the scene is brief (not faulting Andrews or her singing but it's out of place in ""10"") but in other films, he lets things get out of hand. But not in ""10"". Edwards keeps the film focused on the story and the characters. With some fine supporting actors (Brian Dennehy, Dee Wallace) the film is mature and has some relevant, realistic dialogue.",10
54,cheffychic,Entertaining,5,31 August 2001,"Although ""10"" was not as good as i thought it was going to be, i still think that it is a good movie to watch when you're too lazy to get out of the house or something.  Not much else to say except for rent it, because on tv they cut out the funniest scenes, like every other movie.",10
55,dalehoustman,RANDY STUPIDITY,5,17 December 2018,"As far as I could discern, this film was badly dated even before it came to an end. Probably seemed charming and even daring at the time, but I can't imagine how at this remove. Dudley Moore his usual tiresome self, missing Peter Cook badly, and Bo Derek projecting an utterly empty image, a sexual rocket with no booster. As films go this one should.",10
56,Con-Deuce,Blake Edwards' Best Film,7,2 May 2016,"After directing three ""Pink Panther"" comedies, director Blake Edwards made his most seminal film with ""10"" and it is his most sustained, mature work. Nothing before or (sadly) after would match this film. With ""10"", Edwards masterfully combined his unique gift for inventive sight gags with pathos and inflection that worked beautifully for the most part. The film is extremely well directed and acted especially by Dudley Moore. ""10"" would not have been as good as it is without him. For once, Edwards controlled his tendency toward self indulgence which sank some of his films.Moore plays a middle aged music composer facing a self inflicted spiritual crisis regarding his age. Though he's successful and lives in a gorgeous home in Bel Air, he's miserable. We've seen this character construct dozens or more times but Edwards manages to make the material fresh by staging some terrific set pieces that, unlike many other films he directed, feel integrated into the story rather than tagged on for just for laughs (compare ""10"" with his later ""Skin Deep"" to get an idea of what I mean). There's a great bit with Moore falling down a steep hill and another involving cars speeding across the Hollywood Hills. What Edwards excelled at was a kind of minimalist sight gag, a gag that appears out of the corner of the eye like the old lady and the priests home or how he captures the speeding cars by putting his camera above an intersection. He directs his best comedy bits with assuredness and subtlety. Moore's spiritual crisis causes him to chase a newlywed bride to her honeymoon in Mexico. One would think this setup would lose steam but it doesn't (just check out the scene as Moore crosses a rope bridge). Only at the very end does the film's narrative falter a bit when Moore realizes his dream woman is actually vapid and he returns to his senses. The films wrap up at the very end, though, is satisfying.Julie Andrews is fine in her role here though some of her line readings are a bit cringe inducing (i.e. ""do you want to fight or make love""). Edwards throws in some of her singing and in one rehearsal scene, it's jarring. For just a moment the movie falls apart. While Andrews is adequate, a better, more believable actress would have made the film even better but it's a quibble. ""10"" works brilliantly in spite of some problems.",10
57,AgNail,A defining moment in a young man's life...,7,9 May 2000,"All right, so this isn't a great movie. It just happened to come along at the right moment in my life to have an impact. As a young man not yet turned 20, I could certainly identify with both Dudley Moore wanting to recapture youth through a fling with Bo Derek, and Bo Derek just wanting to have fun (and show her appreciation for Dudley's saving her boyfriend's life.) Add to that the fact that I was working at a record shop and remember selling about 9832 copies of Ravel's Bolero, and it boils down to this; ""10"" brings back a host of good memories for me. - mps",10

For me it's a trip down memory lane: I still remember seeing those first pics of Bo Derek with her beads in the magazines back in the day, causing a total sensation. Just like Farrah Fawcett in her bathing suit. It's become such an iconic 70's image.So years later I watched the movie for the first time and finding it a bit tame. However....Watching it as a man approaching his 50's I really learned to appreciate this movie with every repeated viewing. It's a combination of melancholy and reaching the proper age to appreciate the movie's subject I guess.Dudley Moore is just astonishing in this. A total master of comedy and slapstick timing. You just don'ty see that kind of artistry anymore. He simply IS the character and despite Bo Derek's outerworldly physique, you only have eyes for Dudley. He not only saves the so-so script, he lifts it to a higher level for me and turns it into a tribute to my childhood.",10

His quest becomes ultimately hollow when the beautiful woman takes him to bed for no more than a brief recreational romp.In essence, a comic tale of mid-life crisis set in the wealthy world of Hollywood theatrical types memorable for the use of Ravel's 'Bolero'.Julie Andrews gives a fine supporting performance as the hapless 'girl friend' of Dudley More.

And we all know what Steve Martin says about that; ""Of course you have a sense of humor. Everyone thinks they do, even people who don't.""But seriously, 10 is typical Blake Edwards. Another story about a Hollywood man going through a mid-life crisis. And in the case of Dudley Moore, doing it as about as humorous as he possibly can. Julie Andrews, as usual, adds so much to these movies with her dry British wit.If you haven't seen it, and you are wondering if you should, see it. You should be ashamed for not having seen it already. If you haven't seen it, and have no interest, you must like movies about Nazis drowning puppies. And if you have seen it and regretted it, then I hope the medication is working.",10

At the time it was the ultimate date movie for anyone under 30. These days it is pretty tame. Dud is dead (rest in peace), and Julie Andrews has more wrinkles than a king-sized duvet pushed to the bottom of the bed.That said, it still has a lot to say about the rites of passage for those willing to listen, and Ravel's Bolero is still incredibly sensual. The rule of thumb? Every man is an alpha male to somebody, even at 40. The trick from the man's point of view is to know when you are the alpha male. And when you know you are, to make the most of it. And this film, in its own way, demonstrates this perfectly.If you get laid off the back of this film review, please send $10 via PayPal to phil@haigh-family.com ;-)",10
63,Poppybiscuit,So much better than the simple premise,7,9 March 2013,"If you never watch this film because the basic old man chases younger girl theme is too banal, you are missing a treat. This is a classic film, and so much richer than the simple premise. The cornerstone of the movie is the piano scene, outside under the palms by the beach. Dudley Moore, an exceptional pianist, plays ""It's Easy"". He plays for amusement, for himself, he plays with anger, for the frustration of unattainable lust, he plays to tease, to move the (delightful) holiday golddigger and he plays to bond with, perhaps just to impress, the the barman, the provider of his needs, his booze. It's hard to think how a scene could ever be played that could better depict a mid-life crisis, the theme of the film. It has been said that neither Bo Derek nor Julie Andrews were great, or suitable in their roles, but I don't think that matters. With such a strong performance as Dudley Moore gives, supporting roles can only ever be that. The scenes around his arrival at the resort are very funny. Don't just think of this as the film where a middle aged man sees a bikini clad girl running in slow-mo across a beach. That's the punchline - its a lot better than that.",10
64,afenton704,Would be enjoyable if you were a touch retarded,4,10 December 2007,"OUTDATED!!!! Taking into consideration the age of this film is more than necessary when taking it in. Saying this a viewer should not be expected to loose the sense of humour, intelligence and hand eye coordination so as to become the senile target market of the weak and safe plot.It reminds me of any story an old person would try to recall but get confused due to the onset of Alzheimer's, so the tale that might have drawn even the smallest amount of interest collapses into infinite ums and ahs until you want to leap into pit of knives aimed at the softest parts of your body. These ums and ahs are crafted into and soppy plot that goes no where and back again. Don't do this to Dudley see him in Bedazzled (the good one sans Hurley) and Julie in pretty much anything with a musical plot.p.s. Bo Derek sucks in this and having not seen her in anything else, i'm gonna go with acting in general too.",10
65,josh071,10 is a perfect 10,10,21 December 2011,"If your idea of comedy falls in line with Mall Cop or The Hangover, this might not be the film for you. But it could be an eye opener.Revisiting ""10"" in the age of 3D corporate movies is like sitting down to a homemade feast prepared by that someone who really knows what they're doing - and keeps the wine flowing to loosen up the party. It's spicy while delicate, filling, but keeping you wanting more.Like so many greats of the '70s, it is personal and human to a fault. Above all this is a comedy about people: warts, slurs, bee stings, intoxication and all. Dudley Moore plays Beverly Hills composer George Webber like a virtuoso. A diminutive, somewhat immature, borderline alcoholic suffering from midlife crisis, he stalks a young ""perfect 10"" newlywed, stunningly portrayed by uber sex-symbol-to-be Bo Derek. George is about the last person you'd imagine rooting for, and yet, because of his charm, his abilities and his great wit, like a troubled friend we are right by his side. Perhaps most importantly, like all great comedies, his faults and excesses are grand caricatures of our own. There is a process he must go through; and as we may have already learned in our own experience, there is no way around it. But George is not the only one to gain our attention. Like a Robert Altman film, ""10"" is chock full of well rounded characters, being especially ahead of it's time by casting manly Robert Webber as George's gay song writing partner. Others have stated here that Julie Andrews - George's strong-natured girlfriend - is not alluring. But isn't that the point? How many men have beauty pageant girlfriends? In such casting, we go on George's journey to find out what's really important.While ""10"" plunges the human condition with authority, it never forgets that it is entertainment, and it's brand is comedy. ""10"" successfully manages to pepper its human dramas with deft pratfalls, abundant T&A and a steady course of stimulants that belonged to a screens of a different era. The witty banter is of the likes of Preston Sturges, updated to the Woody Allen era. Blake Edwards can have you rolling with laughter, salivating over a hot body, and then nearly in tears with just a man at a piano, unable to come to terms with himself and his world.Roger Ebert has an eloquent review which you can access here. In it he states, ""There used to be a time, incredibly, when you couldn't have something just because you wanted it. ""10"" remembers that time."" Along with George, I mourn this bygone era. As of this post, IMDb's user's review of 5.9 is not only a slap in the face, but a sad reflection on the movie going public in the day of the Movie McMuffin.",10

As a youngster I remember liking this film for the titillating scenes with Bo Derek in them, but becoming a fan of Dudley Moore as an adult and being a pianist myself, the man's comedy timing and musical talent are a joy to behold.The only puzzling thing about this film is the title.

Even in today's society, this movie is hilarious! Dudley Moore is a brilliant comedian. You'll have to add this movie to your ""must list"" if you're a Dudley Moore fan. Whenever I am in a depressed mood I know I can pop this movie in and Dudley is going to be able to make me laugh once again.Get this movie if you want a care-free day of fun and light-hearted amusement. Not as good as Arthur but if you're a Dudley fan like me, you'll love it!Also, you'll hear some beautiful arrangements played by Dudley Moore himself. A classic movie that you should not miss.",10
68,powerje75,10 - Bo Derek and Dudley Moore,7,21 September 2005,"I really enjoyed this film - the whole dream thing for Dudley followed by him actually managing to pull this lovely young thing... it's the stuff of dreams! It also shows that you should never give up on your dreams, but also that dreams are often better than reality (hence he ended up not going through with it) - it's a quality film that deserves more showings on TV than it gets! Of course the gratuitous nudity helped pass along the more boring moments.. and which red-blooded male wouldn't do as Dudley does? Telescopes are definitely NOT useless during the day despite what Patrick Moore might say! So, for sheer eye candy, coupled with getting an ugly man an attractive girl, this film is great to watch - plus it has many comic moments too of course! Marvellous!",10
