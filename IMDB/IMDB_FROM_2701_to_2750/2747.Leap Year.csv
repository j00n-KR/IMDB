0,SnoopyStyle,Irish people should be offended,5,29 September 2013,"Anna Brady (Amy Adams) is disappointed that her boyfriend didn't propose. She decides to follow an Irish tradition of a woman able to propose to her boyfriend on Feb 29 of a leap year. Anna is a prissy girl who stages homes to sell. On her way to Dublin, her travel is sidetracked by storms. Her boat drops her off on an isolated coast of Ireland where the locals are less than helpful. A grumpy Declan (Matthew Goode) ends up driving her.Amy Adams is usually a likable cute actress. Here she has a high minded annoyed disposition. The locals are all unfriendly, unhelpful, and unlikeable. The Irish tourism board should try to ban this. Matthew Goode is too nasty. I understand the tenets of rom-com require they hate each other before they can fall for each other. But there's no real need to push their characters so far. The premise of the movie is stupid to begin with. Luckily they don't spend a lot of time on it. Most of it is Amy Adams and Matthew Goode complaining about the other. At least they're pretty people to look at.",Leap Year
1,Prismark10,A bad leap,2,22 June 2015,"Amy Adams plays a go getter who heads for Dublin in order to get her cardiologist boyfriend (Adam Scott) to accept her wedding proposal by scheduling it on leap day. The reason being he cannot refuse due to the tradition of the country (which is false by the way). She gets detoured as her plane gets diverted and has to find her way to Dublin where she meets grumpy innkeeper Matthew Goode.The film is unfunny, full of stereotypical and non believable characters, even the scenery looks poor as a lot of its bad green screen.As a romantic comedy it fails. You feel little appeal for Adams character and I found Goode's curmudgeon to be off putting as well. No wonder Goode has washed his hands off the film and I expected better from Adams who may I remind you is a five time Oscar nominee.",Leap Year
2,claudio_carvalho,Always Kiss Like It Is the First Time and the Last Time,8,9 July 2010,"The uptight stager Anna Brady (Amy Adams) from Boston is a planner that stages apartments for Realtors. Anna has been dating the cardiologist Jeremy (Adam Scott) for four years and they are buying a high standard apartment in Davenport together. Anna expects Jeremy to propose her in a dinner but he gives a pair of rings to her instead and travels to Dublin for a congress. Anna decides to meet him in Dublin on the February 29th and propose him in accordance with an old Irish folklore tradition from the Fifth Century of leap-year proposals by women. However, her airplane is forced to land in Wales due to bad weather and she is not able to find a connection since the Dublin airport is closed. She decides to travel in a supply vessel but she is forced to disembark in Dingle due to a storm. Anna walks to the only restaurant and inn of the area and she hires the cynical and sarcastic owner Declan (Matthew Goode) to drive her to Dublin. Declan accepts to drive her since he needs money to quit his debts and along their journey they have many incidents. But they fall in love for each other but when they finally arrive in Dublin, Jeremy proposes Anna. ""Leap Year"" is a delightful and innocent romantic comedy. The sweet and gorgeous Amy Adams shines in every scene and Matthew Goode shows a perfect chemistry with her. The plot is predictable but I laughed a lot with the funny situations along the journey of Anna to arrive in Dublin. I know that there are bitter viewers that do not enjoy this type of film that will never be nominated to any award. But I loved ""Leap Year"" with the lovely Amy Adams and the awesome landscapes of Ireland. My suggestion: invite your wife, fiancée or girlfriend; enjoy this adorable film; and always kiss her like it was the first time and the last time. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Casa Comigo?""

3,jboothmillard,Leap Year,5,17 August 2013,"I had heard the title of this film during the time of its release, I knew it was a romantic film, but I had no idea of the concept, I became more interested in seeing it when I saw who the leading actress was. Basically Anna Brady (Amy Adams) is an over-organised planner/interior decorator who has been waiting four years for her cardiologist boyfriend Jeremy Sloane (Piranha's Adam Scott) to propose marriage to her, as they are planning to move into a new apartment in Davenport, but he has been very busy, and he is making a business trip to Dublin, Ireland. She hears about an Irish folklore tradition, that on a leap year, 29th February, the woman is allowed to propose marriage to a man rather than the usual vice versa, so she travels to Ireland a few days before in order to meet him in Dublin and propose, but her flight is diverted due to bad weather and she lands in Wales. Anna cannot find another flight connection as Dublin airport is closed, and taking a supply vessel travelling to Ireland she is caught in another storm and dropped off in Dingle, many miles away from Dublin, so she is forced to find the nearest shelter, in a restaurant and inn. The unfriendly owner Declan O'Callaghan (Matthew Goode) agrees to let her pay and stay the night in a room upstairs, but the next morning there are no direct transport routes, so she asks to pay him to drive her to Dublin, he only agrees as he needs the money to pay debts. On the journey Anna and Declan bicker about many things, and then they run into incidents, such as cows in the road and the car rolling into a lake, walking her bags are stolen by a group in a van, these are retrieved from a pub they stop in, and they reach a train station that only goes to Dublin every few hours, which she misses. Anna in unhappy as the following day she cannot travel on the train or by bus, as it is a Sunday, so she and Declan spend the next day in a bed and breakfast, but they can only stay if they are a couple, which they pretend to be, and they force themselves to share a bed, but they do seem to get on well with some chores and more meaningful conversations. As their time together has gone on it is obvious that they have mutual feelings for each other, and this affection they may have really comes forward when they are forced at the dinner table with people watching to kiss, and it seems passionate. The next day they are allowed to catch a bus together, and Anna finally makes it to Dublin, and Declan watches as it is Jeremy who proposes to her, so he leaves and returns to working at the inn, while the engaged couple return to America and make plans for their wedding. Anna had obviously fallen in love with Declan during their time together, and she is devastated realising that he is the right man after all, as Jeremy explains he had to propose when he did to impress his boss, so Anna returns to Ireland and the inn, telling that she and Jeremy didn't work out, and she and Declan finally embrace their true love, and of course later we see that they get married. Also starring John Lithgow as Jack Brady, Noel O'Donovan as Seamus, Tony Rohr as Frank, Pat Laffan as Donal, Alan Devlin as Joe, Ian McElhinney as Priest and Dominique McElligott as Bride. Adams is amusing and likable as the accident prone and constantly knocked back woman, I agree the Irish accent of Goode is a little strained but he is alright as the bloke she falls for, the story is nothing new, a love develops between two people who hate each other as she tries to get to the man she think she loves, but the mishap filled jokes and the developing relationship are interesting to watch, it not a bad romantic comedy. Worth watching!",Leap Year
4,moonspinner55,Flibberdigibbit comedy...,3,28 January 2012,"Amy Adams is a smart, intuitive actress with a winning personality--she's good in just about everything, except ""Leap Year"", which plays like a lukewarm showcase for any up-and-coming female flavor-of-the-month. Bostonian businesswoman, astute and successful, turns into a squealing featherbrain upon arriving in Dublin, where she plans to follow a tradition and propose to her handsome boyfriend on Leap Day. It's predictable that our heroine will meet a local man who unintentionally stirs her passions, but it is absolutely disheartening that he's just one more hunk in the stable. The wan screenplay (from writers Deborah Kaplan and Harry Elfont, who have seen too many TV shows) assumes that the only way to romantically confuse the protagonist is to replace the first stud with a taller, more rustic one. Instead of displaying the talents of Amy Adams--or the wonders of Ireland--to their best possible advantage, what we get is just another valentine for the fantasy-minded...one where the would-be/will-be lovebirds check into a country hotel under the guise of a married couple; naturally, the room only has one bed, and typically, they flip for it. *1/2 from ****",Leap Year
5,paul_haakonsen,A heartfelt romantic comedy,7,15 January 2011,"Now this was a romantic comedy that actually made it all worth it.""Leap Year"" tells a really good story, that you are easily sucked into and you feel like you are right there in the middle of it all. Maybe it is partly because of the great camera work, the amazing views and the lovable characters, who's to say? And the tradition with the proposal on a leap year, that was actually quite nice as well.Now, the typical love/hate romantic comedies are usually always a sure win, and ""Leap Year"" is no different. The chemistry between Anna Brady (played by Amy Adams) and Declan (played by Matthew Goode) was outstanding, and they were a really good match opposite one another. Anna Brady coming off as the typical American woman used to high end living, while Declan is a down to earth taking life as it comes type of guy. And those two opposites put together worked like a charm. And the movie is set in Ireland, so we are dealing with lucky charms here! haha...The cast was quite good in the movie, and although I haven't been to Ireland, I think the movie portrayed the spirit of Ireland fairly well. At least from what I have seen, read and heard about it from various sources.The scenery and sets of this movie works so well, and I must admit it is quite breathtakingly beautiful in the Irish countryside. Which makes it an ideal location for a romantic comedy.One of the scenes that really appealed to me, was when Anna flipped the fire alarm at the party to see what Jeremy would take with him, after Declan had asked her that question earlier on when she was in Ireland. That scene actually sank right in, and it was just a beautifully thought out and constructed scene, one that I found very important to the movie.""Leap Year"" is actually one of the more heartfelt, warm and loving romantic comedies that I have watched in a long time. And it stands clearly out in the vast number of movies of the same genre. ""Leap Year"" is definitely a movie that is worth checking out if you like romantic comedies. Of course, you know how this movie will end, right from the very beginning, but that is fairly much the standard recipe for a romantic comedy. But nonetheless, ""Leap Year"" is a good movie.",Leap Year
6,edwagreen,Leap Year. Sadie Hawkins Day Ever 4 Years on Feb. 29 ***,8,1 December 2010,"This romantic comedy deals with a lady who enhances apartments when they go on the market. She flies to Dublin to propose to her cardiologist boyfriend. The latter is at a convention there. All sorts of events occur that prevent her from meeting up with the good doctor, and soon she asks a gentleman in a bar to drive her to Dublin.Yes, the film deals with how the two grapple in falling in love with each other. There are some real comic routines which didn't allow her to get to Dublin.Finally getting to Dublin, she is in for a rude awakening when she discovers that marriage is merely a convenience for our doctor. I guess you have to have heart.",Leap Year
7,studioAT,An easy going romantic comedy,5,15 December 2015,"Amy Adams hasn't made too many of these romantic comedies and perhaps the negative reviews this film gained are the reason for that.I think what this film is trying to be is an old fashioned romantic comedy road movie and in many ways it succeeds in doing that. There are some genuinely funny moments and the script certainly has its heart in the right place.A lot of the plus points for this film are related to Amy Adams though because she just shines in every scene, often making dud jokes and corny situations work.I find it interesting that her co-star Matthew Goode openly panned this film because I wasn't convinced by him at certain moments, especially when his accent starts to waver.Overall a good romantic comedy, saved by Amy Adams' performance.",Leap Year
8,sunwarrior13,Falling In Love With A Douchebag,5,24 October 2011,"The only reason I went see Leap Year was for Amy Adams.I do believe that she is a very appealing,sexy and talented actress.Unfortunately,even she herself cannot save the movie from a weak script that is full of predictability and clichés.Leap Year is a romantic comedy that stars Amy Adams and Matthew Goode.It is a film about a woman,who has an elaborate scheme to propose to her boyfriend on Leap Day,an Irish tradition which occurs every time the date February 29 rolls around.But she faces a major setback when bad weather threatens to derail her planned trip to Dublin. With the help of an innkeeper who tries to be funny by being a douchebag,her cross- country odyssey just might result in her getting engaged.The movie fails due to many reasons.Nothing is going to surprise you in the story as I have said,everything is clichéd and predictable.The only surprising element in the story is how a woman would settle for a douche and find him totally likable.Also,the talents of Adams and Goode are totally wasted in this silly romantic comedy.Finally,this movie is simply witless,unimaginative and most of all,far from entertaining.",Leap Year
9,zardoz-13,A Hilarious Comedy of Romantic Errors!,10,10 January 2010,"""Leap Year"" is a hopelessly predictable but totally sentimental romantic comedy about opposites attracting that ranks as the first best movie of the year 2010. Anna (cute Amy Adams of ""Enchanted"") desperately wants to wed her cardiologist boyfriend Jeremy (Adam Scott of ""Knocked Up"") because they have been dating for the last four years. One of her girlfriends spots Jeremy leaving a fashionable, upscale jewelry store and lets Anna know. Anna has to practice her best look of surprise. Surprised is exactly what she is when she discovers that all he has done is buy her a pair of diamond earrings when she thinks that he was going to propose. Soon after Jeremy forks over the earrings, he leaves Anna high and dry in Boston to wing his way across the Atlantic for a medical convention in Dublin, Ireland. Anna is so determined to get hitched that she decides appropriate a venerable Irish custom that her father Jack (John Lithgow of ""Cliffhanger"") likes to embarrass her with at parties. Irish superstition stipulates that on February 29th--in other words leap year-- that the lady can ask for a lad's hand in marriage. Of course, this constitutes sheer desperation on the part of the lady. Nevertheless, Anna books a flight to Dublin to surprise Jeremy who loves his work as a heart specialist so much that his colleagues e-mail him photos of hearts being operated on and solicits his advice. No sooner than Anna gets aboard her jet, they fly into rough weather that closes down Dublin airport and her plane is diverted to Wales. No other flights are scheduled to leave for Dublin so Anna improvises and takes a tugboat, but rough seas force them to drop her off in on the far side of Ireland on the coast. She walks for miles until she reaches a rural Irish village and enters a quaint pub searching for a taxi to take her to Dublin. The proprietor of the pub is a sarcastic charmer named Declan (Matthew Goode, who played Ozymandias in ""Watchmen"") and he rents her a room for the night and promises to take her in his taxi to Dublin. Declan has a low opinion of people in Dublin. They are back-stabbers and heartbreakers. Anna settles in for the evening and discovers that her Blackberry has lost juice. When she plugs it into a wall socket, not only does she short out the entire village but also fries her cell phone.""Leap Year"" qualifies as a hilarious comedy of errors. Once they get on the road to Dublin, they find themselves blocked by a herd of cattle. Declan sits down to wait for the cattle to move. Proactive Anna decides to move them herself. She manages to clear them out of the way and then puts one of her $600 shoes into a cow pie. When she tries to scrape the crap off her shoe on his car, the vehicle slips out of gear and careens downhill into a stream. They find themselves afoot in the middle of nowhere and that is just the beginning. ""Leap Year"" resembles the classic 1934 Clark Gable & Claudette Colbert comedy ""It Happened One Night."" ""Shop Girl"" director Anand Tucker and ""Made of Honor"" scenarists Deborah Kaplan and Harry Elfont keep the laughs and the romance bubbling throughout this 100-minute romantic comedy. Amy Adams and Mathew Goode make thoroughly sympathetic characters and radiate charisma galore. Adam Scott is the kind of guy who puts off everything except his work. There is not a bad scene in the entire movie and one of the best finds Declan asking Anna if she had sixty seconds to take one thing out of her house with flames dancing as high as the ceiling what would she grab. The Irish scenery will knock your eyes out.",Leap Year
10,neil-476,"Didn't believe a word of it, but chuckled anyway",7,3 March 2010,"Amy Adams is an affluent Boston socialite, looking forward to a life of privilege with her cardiologist boyfriend. Not fiancé, note, so when he goes to Dublin for a conference she resolves - on the advice of her father, John Lithgow in a take the money and run cameo - to travel to Dublin herself and propose to him on Leap Year Day in accordance with Irish tradition. Unfortunately, travel doesn't go according to plan and she ends up on a road trip being escorted to Dublin by wryly sarcastic Irishman Matthew Goode. And, of course, we all know what happens when unlikely and incompatible men and women travel together, don't we? There are laughs in this comedy, mostly deriving from assorted slapstick mishaps. but some from the sarcastic dialogue. The problem is that there is little credibility in the story or the characters and their motivations - I never believed that the events of this film could or would happen.Which is a pity because, once Adams gets beyond the initial coldness of her character she becomes fun to be with, and Goode's dry but twinkly Irishman is quite engaging.In fact, Goode is something of a revelation - his character is utterly different from the cold, sterile character he portrayed in Watchmen, to the extent that I didn't realise it was the same actor for some time.",Leap Year
11,ferguson-6,Aorta not make movies like this,3,9 January 2010,"Greetings again from the darkness. Director Anand Tucker has a couple of nice films on his resume - ""Shopgirl"" and ""Hilary and Jackie"". What attracted him to this lame project is beyond me. The best thing I can say about this film is that the preview is actually more complex than the film ... it at least left you with small hope that maybe it wouldn't be as predictable as it appeared.Amy Adams is a fine actress, actually an excellent actress and usually very likable. She really had no idea what to do with this character and thanks to the assembly-line script, who can even blame her. I won't go into the details here ... mostly because I don't want to think about it ever again.The pace of the film is excruciatingly slow. Matthew Goode is miscast. Adam Scott plays a caricature of a stereotype. John Lithgow is one throw-away scene (I actually felt sorry for him). Don't worry though, you do get to see Amy Adams walking through cow dung in expensive heels, and riding a mudslide in expensive clothes, and wheeling her expensive luggage down Irish backroads and a hail storm. If that sounds cute and funny to you ... then I have been too kind in my description.",Leap Year
12,anaconda-40658,Leap Past This Film and See a Better One,3,24 April 2015,"Leap Year (2010): Dir: Anand Tucker / Cast: Amy Adams, Matthew Goode, Adam Scott, John Lithgow, Kaitlin Olson: Boring romantic comedy about pursuing goals. Amy Adams stars as a woman so desperate for marriage that she treks to Dublin to propose to her career oriented boyfriend. Along the way she is assisted by a cynical inn keeper but any moron can see that these two will bicker but eventually fall in love. Despite the ""leap"" in the title, the screenwriter certainly makes no attempt to ""leap"" above the clichés. Director Anand Tucker delivers great Irish photography but the screenplay plays viewers for idiots. Adams and Matthew Goode run around across country while viewers await their arrival at the end credits. Adams is capable of charm and wit but here the screenplay jerks viewers around with a witless scene around a table where everybody shares a kiss. Adams and Goode refuse then give in before the meaningful smooch takes place. Goode is capable of humour but stuck in a road trip that he really isn't needed on and it feels like viewers are being further jerked around. Adam Scott plays the tight ass boyfriend who shows more interest in personal status than Adams. After appearing in this film, his status will need major repair. How unfortunate that John Lithgow is wasted in one pitiful scene as her father. He joins her at a bar, says a few comic lines then is gone from memory. There is no real point to this garbage other than to tease viewers with sappy pitiful romance. This film is more corny than romantic, and its stupid situations may leave viewers leaping from their seats in the direction of the nearest exit. Score: 3 / 10",Leap Year

A less likable actress wouldn't have been able to pull this off.Matthew Goode is a bit unattractive to be the lead.

15,sddavis63,Amy Adams Is Adorable As Always In A Very Sweet Movie,5,14 March 2018,"The story of ""Leap Year"" is entirely predictable, so whether the movie makes the grade or not depends on the journey: how do the main characters actually get to where you know they're going to end up, almost from the very beginning?As Anna Brady, Amy Adams is a real estate ""stager"" (she basically pretties up properties by bringing nice and fancy stuff into the places to make them look better for owners trying to sell) from Boston. She's in a long-term relationship with boyfriend Jeremy (Adam Scott) and she has reason to believe that he's bought her an engagement ring and is going to propose. Instead, she gets ear-rings and he flies off to Dublin on business. Not one to give up easily, Anna travels to Ireland to find him and ask him to marry her, in keeping with an old Irish tradition that the woman can propose to the man on Leap Day - February 29. But weather throws her plans into chaos, and she teams up to travel with with smooth talking local pub owner Declan (Matthew Goode), who's going to help her get to Dublin by the deadline.You get the point. Obviously, Anna and Declan are going to fall for each other. But how's the journey that gets them to that point? It's quite pleasant actually. It's not outrageously funny, although it has some humorous moments. It's very innocent - nothing ""improper"" ever happens between the two of them. And as the viewer you get some really nice shots of Irish scenery along the way. And Anna herself says to Declan at one point that people tell her that her legs are her best quality - and, indeed, there's a fair amount of focus on Amy Adams' legs most of the way through. But it's always very innocent.It's a sweet movie, as opposed to a great movie. Unlike some I didn't personally feel the incredible chemistry between Adams and Goode, but they worked well enough together that I really wanted their characters to end up together. And with Amy Adams being her usual adorable self (I admit I've been a bit smitten with her ever since seeing her in ""Enchanted"") this can't really take a wrong turn. It may not be a great movie - but, yes, it's a sweet romance; a very pleasant movie to watch. I'm only going to rate it as a 5 - but I'd say it's a 5+. Not quite a 6, but a 5+.",Leap Year
16,Hellmant,"Adams is a past Oscar nominee (twice), she's pretty bad in this!",5,12 October 2010,"'LEAP YEAR': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Routine romantic comedy with Amy Adams and Matthew Goode (Ozymandias of 'WATCHMEN' fame) directed by Anand Tucker and scripted by Deborah Kaplan and Harry Elfont (a writing team that also co-wrote as well as co-directed 'JOSIE AND THE PUSSYCATS' and 'CAN'T HARDLY WAIT'). With the talent involved a viewer should be able to expect at-least a little more than what they get here but the film is mediocre at best. Still it's not as bad as some comedic romances and the scenery is beautiful. Adams is a past Oscar nominee though (twice) and she's pretty bad in this.In the film Adams plays an apartment 'planner' who has grown inpatient waiting for her boyfriend (Adam Scott) to propose to her. So she decides to follow him to Dublin, which he heads to for work, in a plan to propose to him on February 29th, which she's heard is the one day when it's OK for a woman to propose to a man (according to Irish tradition). Due to bad weather she ends up in Dingle at it's one local establishment (which serves as the town's local pub, hotel, taxi service, etc.). She convinces the business owner (Goode) to drive her to Dublin and against his better judgment he takes her up on her offer, due to the fact that he's in debt and needs money to save his business. The two of course are polar opposites and don't get along at first but over the course of the trip they learn to really enjoy each others' company. You can probably guess where the film goes from there.Adams is a pretty good actress most of the time but in this role (like I said) she delivers some pretty bad acting, her character is extremely clichéd as well and a little sexist. Goode is adequate as the tough love interest with an accent but he's been much better as well. The film is way too full of over the top slapstick and sexist clichés, at-least for the first half of the film. It does have some breathtaking cinematography though, some nice moments here and there and it does come to a somewhat satisfying conclusion. If you're a fan of slapstick romantic comedies you might not be too disappointed but if you're expecting anything with any kind of a legitimate entertainment value this isn't the movie for you.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YDpWRaEnYQ",Leap Year

19,inkblot11,Leaping Lizards! How nice to start the new year off with a fine romantic comedy like this one!,8,11 January 2010,"Anna (Amy Adams) seems to have it all. First, she has a wonderful job as real estate ""presenter""; that is, she adds heartfelt touches, like homemade cookies in a basket, that helps sell homes for the real estate offices of Boston. Second, she has a wonderful boyfriend of four years named Jeremy. Jeremy is an up and coming cardiologist with a lucrative future ahead of him. Anna is also young, beautiful, and spunky. However, there are two things she doesn't have. There is a posh apartment in the area for sale, which she longs to buy for herself and Jeremy but there are so many folks that want it, also, that the young couple has to compete to get it. More importantly, she doesn't have a ring on her finger after four years of trying. When a romantic dinner with Jeremy fails to produce the desired bit of hardware, only a set of earrings, she remembers her father (John Lithgow) giving her advice only hours before. Leap Day is approaching and, as an Irish lash, she has the right to propose herself, on that day only. Since Jeremy is going to Dublin for a conference, Anna secretly books a flight to surprise him. But, unfortunately, bad weather lands the plane in Wales instead. There are no flights to Ireland the rest of the day. Undaunted, Anna takes a scary boat ride across the Irish Sea and lands in a very small coastal town. Entering the only bar, she asks for a ride to Dublin. The single ""sober"" man is Declan (Matthew Goode), the bar's owner, and he says Dublin's a place of liars and cheaters. Nevertheless, after bunking in an upstairs room for the night, Declan agrees to take Anna on her journey. But, cows, castles, missed trains, and mud all conspire to ruin Anna's chances of making it to Dublin on time. Then, too, Declan, despite his surly disposition, is a handsome lad, who is bound to ""confuse"" her heart just at the wrong moment. Will there be a happily ever after this time? Well, Leaping Lizards, how nice of Hollywood to give us this fine romantic comedy so early in the year. Adams is wonderful as the spunky Anna while Goode, fresh off his amazing performance in Brideshead Revisited, is more than adequate as an Irish heart-throb. Naturally, the Irish scenery is so dazzling that everyone will long to travel there soon, while the costumes, especially Anna's, are very fine. Goode's appearance was a little lacking, especially his unruly hair and stunted beard. I, for one, thought it detracted from his great looks. But, then, the landscape makes up for a lot! In fact, the production's beautiful ""look"" is its best asset, after Adams. So, dear fans of romantic comedy, leap out of your chair, head out the door, and speed to the nearest cinema. When the lights go down, you will be happily, joyfully, absolutely content.",Leap Year
20,callanvass,Not enough bite to get to where it wants to be.,5,29 April 2011,"Credit IMDb A woman who has an elaborate scheme to propose to her boyfriend on Leap Day, an Irish tradition which occurs every time the date February 29 rolls around, faces a major setback when bad weather threatens to derail her planned trip to Dublin. With the help of an innkeeper, however, her cross-country odyssey just might result in her getting engaged.Going into this I thought this had great potential to be an awesome Rom-com. Sadly this is nothing more then a money making Adams Veichle to branch out. Matthew Goode doesn't have the presence or charisma to counterbalance Adams. Scenery is beautiful, but no real laughs, and a whole lot of missed potential.Performances. Amy Adams has her moments of likability, but she can only do so much with material, and I found it hard to sympathize with her character. Chemistry with Goode is non-existent. Matthew Goode is as dull as a box of rocks in my opinion. His stalwart portrayal didn't do much for me. Adam Scott is OK, suited his character well I suppose. John Lithgow was the highlight for me.Bottom line. Average Rom-Com. It's disappointing, cause it could have been a whole lot more. Give it a rental or wait for Telly to see this one.5/10",Leap Year

This romantic comedy takes is basic plot points as snobbish girl meets obnoxious man in a foreign country while making her way to her ""beloved"" to propose to him. A predictable, but consistent, and photographically breathtaking landscape movie, with a nice balance of comedy and drama, yet nothing extraordinarily outstanding. More light-weight than substantive in its more poignant moments and humorous outpouring. Amy Adams comes across pretty unlikeable at the beginning, making her transformation in this movie more challenging, maybe even unnecessarily so. Comparatively, this movie seems to be missing an underlying layered quality that adds a spicy mixture of complexity to other excellent romantic comedies. Intolerable Cruelty (2003) had the high-powered fire works of two A-class movie stars portraying high stakes money in getting married through getting divorced, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003) which plays on the notion of how easy it is to pick up any girl bet, Morning Glory (2010) and America Sweethearts (2001) that both sparkle with all-star casts had the backdrop of television studio dynamics or Salmon Fishing in the Yemen (2011) that added the foreign flavor, Music and Lyrics (2007) had the impending musical piece to be completed for a famous singer and her fans, and Mostly Martha (2001) had the cooking in a restaurant, The Proposal (2009) where Sandra Bullock, a stuck-up business woman marries a man to keep her visa to stay in the State to keep working, Just My Luck (2006) where the luckiest girl's luck gets transferred to the unluckiest guy; You Kill Me (2007) is about a relationship with a paid assassin, while My Super Ex-Girlfriend (2006) had the superhero facing a deadly nemesis, Kate & Leopold (2001) had time travel and being out of both time and place, the classic The Ghost and Mrs. Muir (1947) or the more contemporary Just Like Heaven (2005)had the paranormal, and the contemporary Warm Bodies (2013) undated and included a zombie genre in its theme that all added the in forced interaction and interplay between the couple. I Think I Love My Wife (2007) is an example of the comedic embarrassments of sex with the other woman, but much more dramatic in its overall presentation, a much more difficult creative balance or If Only (2004) that captures a much more substantively nuanced romance, comedy, and drama of the bittersweet vision of love, or the fantastical but superb occult comedy romance drama of the all-star cast of Practical Magic (1998). One a more qualitatively comparative level, Two Weeks Notice (2002) has the same temperament and script quality set in the dynamics of male lawyer and a female lay assistant, 13 Going on 30 (2004) a fantasy of a girl who discover love after waking up to being 17 years older, The Ugly Truth (2009) another straight-forward romantic comedy set in a television setting with polar opposites on fireworks display, or The Truth About Love (2005) centered over a impulsive love postcard set to a woman who already has a love interest who just happens to be he mailer's bestfriend.Leap Year, nevertheless doesn't rise to the almost magical blended complexity and diverting entertainment of Simply Irresistible (1999) centered on the power of cooking or the intriguing element of mental illness in the award-winning Silver Linings Playbook (2012).

23,Rodrigo_Amaro,Great actors and some jokes are the main and good reasons to watch it,9,12 February 2011,"""Leap Year"" is a good romantic comedy that tells the story of Anna (Amy Adams), an American woman who flies to Ireland pursuing a legend where during a leap year, exactly on Feburary 29, the woman proposes the man in marriage and that's what she's gonna do with his boyfriend (Adam Scott) a cardiologist working there. Things doesn't happen so great and while trying to reach him she's gonna travel to Dublin guided by a man she doesn't want to be with, the cynical and quite charming in his own way, Declan (Matthew Goode). A rivalry with some funny situations and that good old sense that we're gonna have that these two figures are gonna be in love with each other before they even know it.As romantic comedies goes this has nothing so different that you haven't saw it in another film of the same genre. But the charm and enthusiasm that makes of ""Leap Year"" a interesting and funny picture is the work of Amy Adams and Matthew Goode, and a brief scene with John Lithgow as Anna's dad. Adams is graceful and it's always great to see in any kind of film (but I couldn't believe in my eyes while researching more about her that she was in ""Cruel Intentions 2"", that was awful, and I didn't even know she was there). Here she plays a decided woman who tries to plan everything and she always end up getting more and more trouble while traveling with Declan, a guy she can't barely talk without arguing. Goode is very funny without being the comedian guy who's usually attracted to this kind of parts, he's funny being this rough guy who has some sensibility, lots of skills and enlightening presence. His jokes in the film cracked me up a lot, specially calling Anna's Louis Vitton bag of Louie (""Don't worry, I'll get Louie"") or when he laughs about Anna's reason of why she traveled to Ireland. The most funniest scene is when she causes a blackout in the village while trying to charge her blackberry.I wasn't too much bothered by the huge amount of clichés presented in the film, but there were few things that almost killed the film for me (before Declan prepares the dinner, scaring Anna with the chicken thing, it was unnecessary and to some viewers might be viewed as a negative moment) and some slowness in the story, and some things of the conclusion, something that viewers are going find obvious, and others will hate it. I enjoyed it but was expecting more, but at least it used something very unexpected that was referred in the middle of the film and it was something that could be of no importance but it had a great meaning in the end (I'm not gonna tell what it was, you're gonna have to find out). Good film, with good romantic and funny moments. And of course, a beautiful and lovely couple to make it more enjoyable. 9/10",Leap Year
24,Thanos_Alfie,Simple romantic comedy movie...,6,4 March 2018,"""Leap Year"" is a romantic comedy in which we watch a woman trying to go to Dublin, Ireland in order to propose marriage to her boyfriend because according to Irish tradition, a man who receives a marriage proposal on the 29th of February must accept it. In her trip she comes in front of many unexpected events and she meets a man who can help her to finally arrive to Dublin.I did not have high expectations of this movie since it's a romantic comedy but I have to admit that at some points of it I laughed a lot. The plot is pretty simple with some cliché but not so boring. The direction made by Anand Tucker is at the same level as the plot but the cinematography is amazing if we think that this movie took place in Ireland which landscape is simply beautiful. In addition to this it has to be mentioned the interpretation of Matthew Goode who played as Declan and he was outstanding at his role and simply hilarious in some points. Amy Adams who played as Anna makes an average interpretation in this movie.Finally I believe that ""Leap Year"" is a simple romantic movie with some funny moments. It's a good movie to spend your time but not expect much from it. I recommend this movie to everyone to watch and especially to couples which I believe they will have a very good time watching it.",Leap Year

And even though you know what will happen in the end, the movie is so entertaining, that keeps the spirit up until the end. Funny dialogs, amazing scenery, many twists and an enjoyable couple gives ""Leap year' a boost to become interesting. Great performances from the actors, even when they seem not to have great chemistry between them.

Nice film,6,20 September 2010,"Amy Adams has been one of my favourite actresses since Enchanted which was very good in my opinion. Here she plays Anna Brady a young woman who travels to Dublin to propose to her boyfriend who is away in Dublin(played by Adam Scott who is a total jerk in this movie as Jeremy). As the plane crashes she ends up in Dingle and she meets a guy who is so arrogant to her named Declan O Callaghan(played by Chasing Liberty's Matthew Goode sporting a very painful Irish accent)I always wonder why would she bother letting him help her get her to Dublin.But there is a reason for this as he was suppose to get married but his fiancé left him for his best friend.So will Anna and Declan fall in love,despite the fact she is getting married to someone else? I have seen Amy Adams in about 7 movies already and this one is actually my mom's favourite movie since Maid In Manhattan and While You Were Sleeping. Yes this movie has been done to death before actually parts of it reminded me of The Proposal. Like I have mentioned I hated this movie before saying it was the worst romantic comedy I have witnessed with Goode's terrible Irish accent that was even more bad than Ralph Fiennes' American accent in Maid In Manhattan. But after watching this movie and now owning it on DVD as I was watching it last night,I kinda like this movie.Yes its no Oscar Worthy film,and its so predictable but as a lover for romantic films such as While You Were Sleeping,27 Dresses,Enchanted and Kate & Leopold to name a few,I really enjoyed this movie. The setting is nice since parts of this was set in Dublin(which I have been to all the time)and in Connemara(where parts of Marley & Me were set).

But the funny and charming performances of Amy Adams and Matthew Goode don't disappoint. Amy Adams brings any sort of energy to any role she plays, and it always seems to pay off. It also does for Matthew Goode, either comedy or drama, it pays off for him too.The film begins with Ann(Amy Adams), an apartment decorator, who hopes her long time boyfriend will purpose to her. But it does not happen that way, and while he is on business in Dubblin, she decides to fly down there and purpose herself, after her father tells her special day called leap year. But unfortunately she doesn't get as far as ire-land. So she aids the help of Declan(Matthew Goode), a cab driver, and restaurant owner. And he is also sine-ck when it comes to love. During that time adventure and misadventure does follow, will they make it?I also really liked scenery, which also took on a life of it's own. Adams and Goode have such great chemistry.

The cast is great and each actor is just right for his/her character. Amy Adams is great in this film, she really does fit the lead role well and she portrays her in a very likable way. Matthew Goode is great as Declan, the owner of a small pub in an Irish village that agrees to drive Anna (Amy Adams) to Dublin. Anna is desperate to get there after her flight is canceled and there is no bus or train. She plans to propose to boyfriend of four years there in accordance with an Irish tradition where the woman proposes to the man on a certain day in a leap year. But, as one might guess, Anna begins to fall for Declan on this hectic journey to Dublin. The dialogue is very well written and the script allows for ample character development for both lead characters, like I said, the romantic chemistry between them is top notch, but it's important in a romance to not only build up a believable romance between the leads but also build them up as people. You must have both so that it's not a situation where either NEEDS the other in order to survive. And this film accomplished that very well. The journey they take is so enjoyable.

31,Samiam3,Schematic but pleasurable.,7,1 June 2010,"Romantic comedies, have never been my cup of Tea, and I don't view many. Nevertheless, I know when one is original and one is not. Leap Year, despite having schematic written all over it, and with a plot that is predicable in twenty minutes, managed to make me smile. As a comedy, It could've been funnier, but it made me laugh more than a bit (sometimes out loud even). Spoiled little Anna Brady from Boston wants to follow her boyfriend to Dublin (where he is attending a conference). She plans to propose to him on Leap Day, an old Irish tradition. Starting with a bit of flight turbulence, the entire trip goes wrong. She ends up in a remote bar in the Irish hills, where the barkeep, Deaclan (for a price) offers to drive her to Dublin. Bad luck comes their way and before long they are on foot, about to embark of on a very weird journey. Amy Adams is always cute, but I don't actually find her and Matthew Goode to be a Goode screen couple. In fact almost all couples in romantic comedies are mixed matched, that is part of where the humour comes from. To borrow a cliché, it is true that opposites attract. The key to effectiveness is whether the stages of attraction are more believable than they are staged. I like the way Leap Year plays out. It is fluid, but the last fifteen to twenty minutes could use a bit of trimming I think. Long before we get to that point in the film, we know how it is gonna end, (and the filmmakers know we know) so there is no real reason to postpone the moment longer than necessary.Leap Year for the most part does what it sets out to do, and I liked it.",Leap Year

Something was missing, although I can't quite put my finger on it. I guess the great songs and dance routines really helped along the pace of the original, as did the brilliant and colourful Indian culture.

Not too much luck so far but one keeps hoping.""Leap Year"" directed by Anand Tucker uses the same exact recipe for romantic comedy as thousands flicks did before it. A successful professional young woman Anna (Amy Adams) has a proper and perfect boyfriend, Jeremy (Adam Scott), the cardiologist with whom she is buying the posh apartment in the best Boston area, waits for the proposal with the ring, decides to use Irish Leap Year tradition to propose him instead and finds herself in some Irish country side instead of Dublin where her boyfriend-cardiologist is attending the conference. She employs the services of the young local inn-keeper named Declan (Matthew Goode) to get to Dublin even though she did not like the guy at all thinking of him rude bumpkin redneck - Irish style. He in turn sees her as a typical arrogant airhead American who calls her suitcase by the name (Louis Vuitton that is). He also finds her romantic idea of proposal to her boyfriend on February 29 of the leap year the most stupid thing ever. But she is willing to pay and he desperately needs money to upgrade the inn. So off the go - she in her $600 5 inches hills. Considering that she would have to do a lot of walking since the ""classic"" red little car that Declan offered as the means of transpiration was not very reliable to say the least, you might ask why Anna did not pack a pair of sneakers or comfortable walking shoes in her precious Louis Vuitton luggage? But I assume that walking, limping, stumbling in the high heels and felling on the country muddy roads during never-ending rain is one of the ingredients for the perfect romantic comedy recipe.Number one rule in the romcom which sometimes works fine (It did indeed in ""It Happened One Night"") - if the girl and the boy hate each other in the beginning of the film and they are sent to a journey together, they may end up well not hating each other that much in the end. The film creators did not break any of the rules and it is up to us to believe in Ever after.As predictable as it sounds, ""Leap Year"" is actually a pleasant little movie perhaps because two main characters are funny and likable as played by Amy Adams and Matthew Goode. I liked Goode especially. If I had to choose between him and Anna's materialistic boyfriend Jeremy, there would be no doubt in my mind from the beginning. Declan got charisma and sense of humor that make him irresistible. And he is cute, too. As an Irish travelogue, the movie is not bad at all and pleases the eye with some nice scenery. It is predictable in a cozy, uneventful way but you could have spent 100 minutes much worse - to watch Lars von Trier's ""Antichrist"", for example.",Leap Year
34,lewiskendell,"Not bad, not bad at all.",6,4 January 2011,"Amy Adams is one of the few actresses that I would watch in absolutely anything. She could be starring in a movie about cold sores, and I'd still check it out. How could you not love her? She's gorgeous, a great actress, and she makes even a middle-of-the-road romantic comedy like Leap Year worth watching for someone like me who only occasionally finds something in the genre that can hold my interest for me than four minutes.Adams stars as Anna, a woman who concocts a plan to travel to Ireland to propose to her boyfriend (who seems reluctant to pop the question after four years) on February 29, the day when Irish women are traditionally allowed to propose to men. Of course, her flight into Dublin is postponed, and in the interest of making it to her destination on time, she has to rely on a local young innkeeper named Declan (that she initially doesn't get along with, naturally) to drive her from his small town to Dublin. At that point, Leap Year essentially becomes a road trip movie, as Anna and Declan have various misadventures throughout the beautiful Irish countryside and, well, I'm sure you can guess what else happens. As far as romantic comedies go, Leap Year is mildly funny, mildly entertaining, and mildly predictable. It's not quite as fresh as a movie like Adam, but not nearly as bland or cloying as recent bottom-tier efforts like Letters to Juliet. The end goes on far too long to reach it's obvious conclusion, but I guess that just comes with the territory. It's not a bad movie at all, though I'll admit that I probably wouldn't have found it as interesting (or perhaps seen it at all) without Adams in the lead role. Fans of hers can watch this without fear that you'll die from a banality overdose before it's done.",Leap Year
35,bkrauser-81-311064,Just Skip This Year,2,18 December 2013,"Falling asleep during 2010's Leap Year would have actually been a stroke of luck comparable to finding a four leaf clover or kissing the blarney stone. Leap Year was a boring, witless exercise in romantic comedy clichés without the benefit of believable, sympathetic characters or even a high concept that makes a lick of sense.So desperate to tie the knot and get on with her paint-by-numbers life, Anna (Amy Adams) follows her boyfriend (Adam Scott) to a medical conference in Dublin, hoping to propose to him on the 29th of February, believing a proposal on a leap day cannot be refused. Unfortunately due to inclement weather her plane is rerouted and she has to go traipsing across the Irish country side with a young Irish yokel (Matthew Goode) to get to her destination in time. They don't get along very well, so naturally they fall in love by the end of the movie.I will admit I am not a fan of romantic comedies in general. I try to approach them with an opened mind, I really do but out of literally every other genre in film, rom-coms have not evolved since It Happened One Night (1934). Its not entirely their fault. With romantic entanglements becoming obligatory across all genres, romantic comedies simply can't keep up; at least not without resorting to cheap and contrived story-lines like say, a wedding planner who falls in love with a groom, a slacker interventionist who falls in love with her project or a columnists who tries to get a guy to break up with her in 10 days. At least the creators of Leap Year had the courtesy of not adding Matthew McConaughey to the cast.Overall it was unoffensive in its blandness; at least story wise. What really got to me were the vast array of logistical problems the film kept taunting me with. There is one scene early on where a car rolls into a lake because in romantic comedies traveling can never be simple. There is mention of a tow-truck but nothing ever becomes of it so one can assume the car floated around in the water for a couple of days rusting and causing environmental damage. Speaking of the environment, shouldn't it have been a bit colder in February? There seemed to have been a lot of flower blooming throughout the countryside when they should have been covered in snow. My biggest problem however is the idiotic way in which Anna gets to the Emerald Isle. Her plane lands in Wales and she charters a fishing boat to the city of Cork in the middle of a storm (because such a risk isn't absolutely ludicrous). She of course doesn't make it there and is forced to dock in the middle of nowhere. Isn't Cork 252km south of Dublin? Wouldn't it be better to charter a boat directly to Dublin it being closer to Wales and all? Oh and of course there's my personal favorite, them kissing right before the credits role as the sun sets towards the Atlantic Ocean and not the Irish Sea.Yes I notice things like that. Like when movies are meant to be in New York but are clearly shot in Toronto. Sometimes finding errors like that can be fun (ever sit down to really count the bad guys in Die Hard (1988)?).

I really disliked Leap Year.Anna is our main character, successful but not-yet-engaged. She's desperate to get married (one of the many aspects of her character that bothered me), so we are off to Ireland to propose to her boyfriend Jeremy. Cue all the problems. I was prepared for all the ridiculous obstacles in getting to Dublin, but I wasn't prepared for Anna's extreme selfishness in forcing everybody she meets to get her there. Because I found Anna so unlikeable, I couldn't find the humour in any of the contrived (not actually existent) travel problems in Ireland.Ireland is a great setting, but they didn't really show us any part of it. Every time they had an opportunity for a beautiful wide shot of the countryside, they instead filled the screen with Amy Adams' and Matthew Goode's faces. Sure they are pretty, but Ireland is prettier.This movie also had a lot of mistakes. All the geography of Ireland that they tried to show us was wrong. The bit of back-story that they gave for Anna was contrary to the selfish, superficial girl she is.I am the target audience for this movie, and yet I hated it.

40,hall895,Better than some people think,7,26 May 2012,"Matthew Goode thinks Leap Year is a terrible movie. What's odd about that is Goode is one of the stars of the movie. What's even more odd is that it is not at all a terrible movie. Yes, it is very predictable and formulaic. But sometimes you have to remember that in life there are established formulas because those formulas work. And Leap Year, for what it is intended to be, works. No, it is not by any means a serious motion picture. But not every movie is meant to be The Godfather. There's plenty of room in the world for a light, breezy, enjoyable romantic comedy. And Leap Year fits the bill.Amy Adams plays Anna, an ultra-organized Boston woman who has her life planned out down to the tiniest detail. She patiently waits for Jeremy, her boyfriend of four years, to propose to her. Finally her patience runs out. When Jeremy takes off for Dublin for a cardiology convention Anna decides to follow him, intending to take advantage of an Irish tradition of women proposing to their men on Leap Day. Unfortunately a storm causes her flight to be diverted and when she finally gets to Ireland she's not in Dublin but way over on the other side of the country. Stuck in this rural no-man's land she needs transportation to Dublin. Enter Goode's character of Declan, the town's innkeeper, bartender and, most importantly, taxi driver. So Anna, the prim, proper girl with her whole life planned out and Declan, the earthy, sarcastic guy who flies by the seat of his pants set out on their road trip. Gee, you don't suppose this mismatched couple might end up falling for one another do you? It's a movie with very little drama. You know the formula, so you think you know where the story's headed. But just because you think you know the ultimate destination that doesn't mean you can't have some fun along the way. Leap Year is not a movie which is uproariously funny by an means but there are enough solid laughs scattered throughout to keep you smiling. The interplay between Adams and Goode is excellent. Adams is relentlessly charming and Goode makes for a very good rogue. The movie looks spectacular, the rolling Irish countryside a sight to behold and a wonderful setting for the story. Many people seem to bemoan what this movie isn't. They miss what it is. A charming, fun, entertaining romantic comedy. That's all the movie aspires to be and in this aim it succeeds.

The guy is billed as ""charming"" but comes off as an asshole, the lady is an up-tight stick in the mud because writing a multi-dimensional character for women is really hard, I guess. 2. Since screen writing must be so incredibly difficult, when these two clichéd characters interact it's through arguing. See, having characters argue is a good substitute for quality dialog when none is provided for in the screenplay. 3. Hey, Ireland sure looks pretty though, doesn't it? If you are planning a once in a lifetime vacation you could do a lot worse than Ireland. 4. Why did the film makers work so hard for this movie if their intention was to make this movie?",Leap Year
44,bopdog,Extremely likable cast and elements in a very clumsy and awkward film,6,10 January 2010,"Amy Adams is a sweetheart, and likable in anything. This rom-com had all the proper ingredients for a great film in that genre, but was fairly clumsy in the execution of the formula pieces. It lumbered along point-by-point, as if making the film from a manual on romantic comedy. Nothing wrong with a formula flick following a formula! But this one just didn't do it very well. No grace.First, as is typical, the girl (Amy Adams) is shown with the ""perfect"" life. She's about to get engaged to her boyfriend, a cardiologist. Then misunderstandings ensue, sending him off to a conference in Dublin, Ireland, without popping the question. Oh dear! (sarcasm...) But wait, she remembers her grandmother having followed a lame ""Irish"" tradition of proposing to her man on February 29th of a leap year. How charming! (Not) How ethnic! (Except that idea is flogged by greeting-card companies everywhere, and is equally ignored everywhere, and is not charming nor ethnic nor Irish) One disaster after another gets her stranded in East Jesus, Ireland (Dingle), setting out in a 40 year old pre-seat belt Renault 4 for Dublin with a handsome bloke. Misadventures on the way (who would have thought?). They meet interesting folk on the way, and fall in love. or do they? Etc. Her erstwhile fiancé at the conference finally meets up with her and proposes. Later, back in America she discovers he only did so to get a lease on an exclusive condo. He always seemed smarmy and shallow, now she sees it too. Disillusioned, she breaks the once coveted engagement and shows up back in Dingle. Only now the bloke, on the skids when she first met him, is a chef running a gastro-pub with standing room only (where did all those affluent customers come from in the once deserted pit that was Dingle at the start of the film?).The writer jams in one cliché after another- when Amy Adams proposes to her ""true"" love at the end of the movie, he does not speak, but just walks away in the crowded restaurant. Thinking she was jilted, she walks out to a cliff. he shows up, and proposes to her--- he had only walked away to get his grandmother's ring to give her... Etc. etc. etc.But Adams is so appealing that one is tempted to forgive all of that just to enjoy her company for a couple of hours. Mattew Goode as the bloke is a very solid and appealing actor as well. The folk they meet (except the Dingle crowd, who just seemed drunk and stupid, and the criminals that seem to populate most of rural Ireland for this director) are charming. The locales are evocative. All the ingredients are here for a great film. This COULD have been a sheer delight! As it was, it was only ""not bad."" A pity. Ah well...",Leap Year

Literally every second of this film has been done in at least 10 more romantic comedies. The only reason romantic comedies are still being made is to place beautiful, well known people in front of a camera to completely and utterly humiliate themselves for two hours. This review will be much shorter because I have decided not to explain the plot because you know what's going to happen. If everyone could only go back to the 80's when romantic comedies like When Harry Met Sally, Bull Durham, Can't Buy Me Love, Say Anything, Blind Date, and The Sure Thing among others existed. Leap Year is just another example of how Hollywood has run out of original ideas. I wasted 2 hours of my life on this crap. Sure, I feel bad for myself, but why would such talents as Amy Adams, Adam Scott, Matthew Goode, John Lithgow, and Kaitlin Olson (if you don't know that name she is great on both It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia and Curb Your Enthusiasm) waste so much time on this piece of garbage?

48,jonathanruano,Leap Year - Easily One this Year's Best Romantic Comedies,8,10 November 2010,"Director Anand Tucker's ""Leap Year"" is about a young and beautiful business woman, Anna Brady (Amy Adams), who goes to Dublin, Ireland to propose marriage to her boyfriend Jeremy (Adam Scott). Along the way, she experiences several misadventures, many involving a ruggedly handsome Irish man named Declan (Matthew Goode) who agrees to take her to Dublin. At first Anna and Declan seem incapable of getting along with each other, but eventually and perhaps inevitably they fall deeply in love. Suffice to say, the feelings that Declan and Anna have for each other make for a very complicated situation when Anna meets Jeremy in Dublin.In other words, the plot of ""Leap Year"" is the plot of any other romantic comedy. But what makes this romantic comedy different from all the rest is that watching Amy Adams and Matthew Goode performing on-screen is a positive treat, because their characters are smart, charming and very likable. Moreover, the filmmakers handled Anna and Declan's transition to falling in love surprisingly well. And in saying this, I speak from experience. I have seen many romantic comedies where this transition was handled clumsily, like ""Here on Earth"" with Leelee Sobieski and ""Life as We Know It"" with Katherine Heigel. But in ""Leap Year,"" they get it exactly right and this is because an intelligent script was written, the actors were well chosen (Matthew Goode was particularly effective as Declan), and the direction was expert. Finally, the land itself (i.e. Ireland) served as an important character in this film. The Irish rural culture, the frequent rainfall, the cows blocking the road and the castle ruins created a delightful atmosphere for this love story to unfold. So if you like romantic comedies, you will probably love ""Leap Year."" And even if you dislike romantic comedies, you may be surprise yourself by enjoying this film.",Leap Year

50,GirishGowda,Its Sweet,6,28 July 2010,"I am a guy who has grown up on action, animation and romantic movies. So I love them, even though they are predictable like hell. And Amy Adams is one of my favorite actress (her smile is wonderful) which would make this a pretty good watch, for me. This movie, though a romantic comedy is low on laugh out loud sequences and filled with moments which brings a small smile. Amy Adams brings about the necessary charm which her character needs, while Matthew Goode brings his brooding good looks to the table. The movie is slow at times and those who like 27 Dresses type of movies probably will like this. And the English accent is hard to understand sometimes, so the subtitles come in handy. The chemistry between the two lead actors is good, but Matthew Goode doesn't give the feeling that he is too involved with the story.Anna Brady (Amy Adama) from Boston is a planner who stages apartments for Realtors. Anna has been dating cardiologist, Jeremy (Adam Scott) for four years and they are buying a high standard apartment in Davenport together. Anna expects Jeremy to propose to her on a dinner date but he gives her a gift instead, after which he travels to Dublin for his work. Anna thinks he is the one for her and decides to take matters into her own hands. Anna decides to meet him in Dublin on the February 29th and propose to him in accordance with an old Irish folklore tradition from the Fifth Century of leap-year proposals by women where the man has no other choice but to accept the woman's proposal. However, her airplane is forced to land in Wales due to bad weather and she is not able to find a connection since the Dublin airport is closed. She decides to travel on a small boat but is forced to disembark in Dingle due to a storm. Anna walks to the only restaurant and inn and hires the unfriendly owner Declan (Matthew Goode) to drive her to Dublin. Declan agrees to drive her as he needs the money to pay off his debts and save his inn. They go on an adventure together which will make a lasting impression on both of them.After Declan's car was jeopardized by Anna, he had no reason to go along with her, but the director makes him follow Anna wherever she goes. That was just stupid; we know he doesn't have any feelings for her, other than contempt. He could have taken the money for the car and just left, which wouldn't make much of a story to begin with. See, that is the problem with this movie, it doesn't have a good enough story to move forward. The director tries too hard to move the plot forward and Amy Adams is a good actor, but she is wasted here. She didn't have to do this movie as it won't propel her career forward. But we now know that Amy Adams is not afraid to get down and dirty, she is very good in the movie. Declan's character is a guy who doesn't like women, so he behaves like a jerk towards Anna. The problem is Matthew Goode is too laid back right till the end and isn't very likable, unlike Amy Adams' Anna. As always in romantic movies, the ending is too predictable and everyone can guess who Anna will be with in the end. The scenic locations, excellent camera-work and background score make this quite a good watch.6/10",Leap Year
51,thefan-2,Stereotype central,5,20 November 2010,"This is one of those if-anything-can-go-wrong-it-will romantic comedies. If there's a plane, it won't take off; if there's a car, it'll break down in the middle of nowhere; if there's a train, the heroine will miss it. This simple-minded fun wears very thin very quickly. What I found even more offensive was the long list of stereotypes the movie presents as truth - the Irish are not terribly bright, they drink too much and they love to fight. They are also terminally colorful, with boatloads of goofy mannerisms and mumbled Gaelic weirdness. They are impossibly rude to lost Americans, at whom the men point and laugh like mean girls. Even their dogs are mean. One thing this movie gets completely wrong is the Boston Irish girl played by Amy Adams. Apparently, the writers think Boston Irish are a stuffy, humorless race of gingers who never joke about anything and never realize they're being teased. Also, she sounds like she grew up in Colorado. (I'm told Matthew Goode's Irish accent is all wrong, too.)There is some lovely authentic-looking scenery, which earn 5 stars for this movie.",Leap Year

She is further disappointed when he immediately has to leave the country temporarily. Being the woman she is, she spends no time with self pity but decides it's time to go to Dublin and propose to him as Leap Year permits.Leap Year is an excellent romantic comedy. I was reminded of Doris Day and Audrey Hepburn comedies. Nothing hilarious, Amy really has wonderful physical comedic skills but still allows her charm to come across and make me smile. While the movie gets a little clumsy, nothing is bad enough to keep me from appreciating her. Her chemistry with Matthew Goode played well. He was fun to watch as the Irish he-man who lives a casual life with no expectations and no concern for others'. But then along comes Anna, and their one-track lives intertwine and soon the future becomes less clear. Anna and Declan travel to Dublin finding strangers and situations that force them to examine life and its meaning, or lack thereof. A forked road appears and we find both now have reason to question a future with or without each other.Please don't expect hilarity. Sit down, get comfy, and admire a good, simple love story.

But with Leap Year, I am not sure if it was because I was up at 1:00 a.m. in the morning or that Ireland's scenery is just so breath taking I liked it. Granted a 5/10 may not seem like a ""like."" But I see an average movie as something to rent out on a rainy day when you are bored or just in a Amy Adams mood.Quite honestly, I haven't seen a lot of things other than Enchanted that I liked her in. I saw Sunshine Cleaning and Julie and Julia both of which she did not stand out to me at all. Also in Leap Year, she has some crazy side profiles where you see how big her nose is. Which is quite surprising, considering it looks so petite/medium from the front.I also find it funny that the main guy from Party Down is her business, and practical boyfriend. It was random that Dee from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia was so tamed and normal as her best friend.Also, the Irish guy is quite the hottie, he has the greenest eyes.

The lead actors had an easy chemistry and their banter was fun to watch. Most importantly, I was invested in the story from the get go.Anna (Amy Adams) has planned to propose to her boyfriend of 4 years. She has planned the proposal at Dublin, Ireland, where according to Irish customs, it is good luck for a woman to propose to a man on Leap Day. As she journeys from America to Ireland, where her boyfriend is attending a conference, she runs into bad luck when bad weather conditions put a damper on her plans. She finds herself in a bar where she meets Declan (Matthew Goode), who ultimately agrees to take her to Dublin by road, for a price. A black cat crosses her path before she begins her journey and villagers notify her that it would bring bad luck, but she continues on her path. Well, apparently the villagers were right. They got into trouble at almost every step.Amy Adams does the role of a neurotic best. She seemed to fit into the character's shoes so comfortably. Her frustrations with travelling to Dublin were rendered even funnier with her facial expressions. Matthew Goode was also quite good in his role as a cynic. Their chemistry was very fluid and real.The backdrop was absolutely breathtaking and the supporting characters enriched the film furthermore. The dialogue was crisp and witty and the comedy of errors, really engaging. Suspension of belief is a big requirement for this film since a lot of the events are slightly improbable, but overall, this was a good one-time watch. I enjoyed it a lot.",Leap Year
56,n-mo,"A good ""feel-good"" afternoon",6,23 August 2010,"When you're an American expat with some small degree of Irish descent and a Claddagh on your finger living in Paris and musing about toward the end of August (vacation month in France), sometimes you want to reconnect.That's why I enjoyed going to see ""Leap Year."" There's lots to love here:Amy Adams. What more can one say? Natural, beautiful, and portraying a character with perhaps some degree of negative influence from the flighty flighty American ""Sex and the City"" culture--but still capable of so much more. By the way, I like seeing a woman wearing high heels on a regular basis.Backdrop realism. I went to Ireland on holiday back in 2007 and one leg of the trip was a 4-night stay in Dingle, County Kerry. It was hell, and I was happy to leave and get to Dublin. Most films about Ireland portray the Irish as unflinchingly friendly. And hey, most Irish are. But as for Dingle... I can relate to Anna.Gorgeous cinematography. There's something about the green. And heck, there's even something about the trendy Bostonian restaurants and parties that brings me back to my university days. Same with Anna and her little binging spree on the beach. (I went to school in South Florida.)Good moral connotations. The pre-marital living arrangement is doomed for failure, and almost obviously so, from the start. Anna, seeing that trying to plan or control everything doesn't work out, tries to open everything up and make it all whimsical, and Declan is there to remind her why that won't work, either.Still, it's got it's share of flaws:Predictable. We know pretty quickly that Anna is going to have to make a choice... and when the ending comes, there isn't really a choice to make; it's obvious which one she should take. I was rather disappointed--and had I been Declan I might have felt mildly insulted as well.Undeveloped potential. Anna talks about her father's irresponsible investment scheme as a background to her longing for surety, and this is welcome as a bit of detail to deepen the character. However, Anna's childhood disappointments do not figure deeply into her character's story--nor do her struggle to overcome, nor does any explanation of why she still gets on with her father; have they already broken/reconciled?Melodrama. The scene with Anna gazing off the Kerry cliffs into the Atlantic seas is just too much to swallow, and very nearly ruins the character.Cliché. In actuality, American high society does not really care any more whether unmarried couples live together and for that matter, neither do Irish couples. This is in my opinion a sad development, but it is true nonetheless. Also, Dingle is far from sleepy--the town is so commercialised and crawling with American tourists you wouldn't believe it.Overall, if you go into this knowing that it's a romantic comedy, and you are prepared for some disastrous flaws within, you'll just enjoy yourself and get over the whole ""chick flick"" thing.

And convenient it is: Jeremey is called to Dublin. Now or never. A storm forces the plane from Boston to land at Cardiff. And here is no ferry to Cork. And the hired tugboat leaves her at Dingle. What is here? Declans local hotel and his taxi. The journey with the rude Declan to Dublin is predictable. Has to be. Must. In our time have few time. Departure and arrival 'deletes' the between, the journey. What happens? And how and why? Declan tells himself: ""Don't listen to her. She knows not what she says."" The only thing for her is: coming in time to Dublin. Nothing changes her mind: storm, cows, the taxi, rowdies, missed train, kissing as pretending wife the pretending husband and sharing (with her future husband) the bed. But: ""Do you know what? All your beastliness is like? It's an act. It's a great, big, massive cover-up. And you growl and you snap, but you are in pain. And you've got a, You've got a big thorn in you beastly paw. Like a lion. A lovely, lovely lion."" The 'thorn' is his former fiancé Kaleigh who deceived him with his friend. Waiting for the train, they climb the hill to the ruins of Ballycarbery: ""It's one of the ten wonders of Irland"", says Declan. And riddles her: ""If your apartment's on fire ... and you had 60 seconds, what would you take. ... Would it be the Chihuahua on the duvet. ... You've got 60 seconds. What are you going to grab?"" And: ""I know exactly what I'd 'grab'"". Anna: Oh, yeah? What?"" ""Not telling you."" She: ""You can dish it, but can't take it, can you?"" Answered later in Boston by Jeremy at their engagement party. His answer is Annas last piece of the Jeremy puzzle she looked at but never saw. And Jeremy never deceived her. Just a modern guy. The marriage is the entrance to their flat: ""Married, you're in. Unmarried, you're out"". What does Jeremy with 'his' 60 seconds? And Anna starts the fire alarm: ""Do you have everything you need. Can you just look around for valuables? For laptops, cameras, whatever."" Anna from Boston makes once more the 300 miles to Dingle and wants to know what Declan makes with his 60 seconds: ""When my 60 seconds came around I realized I had everything I ever wanted. But nothing I really needed. And I think what I need is here. and I came all this way to see if you maybe think so too. If you do, well. I don't really have plans past that, which is new for me. So, Declan O'Callhan and I should probably learn your middle name, here is my proposal; I propose we not make plans, I propose we give this thing a chance and let it work out how it works out. so what do you say, do you wanna not make plans with me?"" Also the wounded lion Declan learned during the journey his lesson and called in Dublin Kaleigh. Is somewhere between Dingle and Dublin the point of no return for Declan and Anna from Boston? It is the journey. For better (that they meet) and for worse (the black cat crosses 'their' road, making the journey difficult). She accepts Declans: ""Why don't you stop trying to control everything in the known universe. It's dinner. Have a little faith that it will all work out.""

In this day and age of special effects; car chases; bombings; foul language; gratuitous sex, this is something for everyone to see and no offense will be taken. LEAP YEAR tells the story of starry eyed Amy Adams, wonderful as usual, going to Dublin to propose to her fiancé who is there on business. Of course getting to Dublin is the problem and the gest of the movie. This is kind of a ""road trip"" movie with lots of problems and entanglements with her guide played by a very good Mathew Goode. We all know how it's going to end so no big deal there. On DVD, be sure to watch the deleted scenes. They are good and add a lot to the plot. Why they were left out is a mystery. Sure would like to talk to the director as to why he cut them. Two of the scenes feature John Lithgow and they are great. Without the deleted scenes he only has a cameo of two minutes or less. What a waste of talent. Again, be SURE to watch those deleted scenes.",Leap Year

67,Sweetigal85,Cute but not perfect,6,29 May 2017,"I was really expecting better from the movie, especially since I have always been intrigued by the leap year. It is a classic boy meets girl story which intentionally goes awry before they of course end up together in the end. I just felt the premise was meh and the middle was slow and forced.I am a big fan of Amy Adams and she is adorable as usual in this movie though very uptight. I actually did not like her character in the movie AT ALL which is funny because she is actually a lot like me lol. Super organized, anal, OCD, etc. I know these are not flattering qualities and I do not like seeing them in myself or another character haha.I had never seen the male lead before and although he fit the bill when it came to looks, I utterly despised his character. I know they were going for the opposite of the protagonist, but did they need to make him so gross, goofy and crude? Again, I guess that's what they were going for making him the opposite of her but I really just didn't care for the extreme contrast. Usually I find men 75% more attractive when they have this kind of accent but I found him incredibly difficult to even understand and anything but charming.Still, there are definitely cute parts throughout and a few laughs. Most people I spoke to adored this movie so maybe it is just me. The ending is worth the wait and definitely will leave you smiling. Definitely worth a watch, I just wouldn't watch it again.",Leap Year
68,touser2004,94%. Like rating on google,9,6 February 2019,"The critics slammed this movie rather unfairly In my opinion but while looking up the film on google I noticed that this film had a 94% like rating .For perspective this is higher than Love Actually ,Serendipity,Pretty Women ,in fact higher than any other romantic comedy that I could think of .Though far from perfect I think it is a bit of a hidden gem with subtle lines and actions that are only observed on a second viewing.
Matthew Goode is charming and nails the irishness of the hurt and cynical Declan ,but you feel ,that in parts ,he is just about holding onto the Irish accent ,still his grumpiness is very realistic (reminds me of an Irish cousin)and his soft heart and decency slowly becomes apparent to all.
Amy Adams though given some truly awful lines to say ""it's not poo it's romantic""manages to present a character that most men would fall for - classy, vulnerable and easy on the eye.Adams does the humour very well and convincingly shows her slowly growing affection for Declan with involuntary looks and smiles and a realisation that Declan's bad attitude actually masks a recent hurt that he is too proud to talk about .The turning point in the relationship is whenDeclan apologises after he learns of Anna's fathers feckless nature .She is visibly taken back -this is not the man she thought he was. Shortly after Declan shocks her again and she exclaims ""you surprised me me ,you keep doing that"" This is from someone who said to Jeremy ""You know I don't like surprises ""From that moment on the film is a delight .Anna now smiles instead of growls at his jokes and the kiss with Declan is a perfect illustration of the state of their relationship .Initially hesitant she is aroused by Declan's passion but it's a wary Declan (who has only recently been hurt)that finishes the kiss early .
Though they argue at the wedding Anna is surprised again to learn that Declan was once engaged but her attempt at sympathy is brazenly rebuffed by a jealous Declan who knows that Jeremy cannot be the right man for AnnaHer drunken claim ""that she cannot stand him ""is immediately betrayed by her attempted kiss and her insistence that he earns his money and takes her all the way to Dublin shows ,,that she is beginning to fall for him.The scenes in Dublin show them as one ,concerned about each other rather than their own agendas . The scene at the bridge is sublime with Anna finally earning Declan's trust and Declan reluctant to push his claim to replace Jeremy in Anna's affectionsDeclan :I'm just the old bag carrier .Why should I care?
Anna :So you don't?
Declan:Would it make a difference?He leaves the decision to her
Although the plot is somewhat unrealistic there is some lovely dialogue (When Anna tells about her feckless father and Declan drops his guard and shows he cares) but it has too many lazy momentsfor example : where Anna talks about proposing as romantic and the dreadful ""heads I win and tails you lose"" - even a primary school child wouldn't fall for that Unfortunately these blatant errors make it very easy for critics to slate the film.
The saving grace for this film is warmth and essential goodness and vulnerability that Adams and Goode bring to their roles.The physical attraction between them is obvious but what cements the relationship and gives it authenticity is the growing respect and friendship between the couple .
Some of the subtly is missed on a first viewing :
Anna only says yes to Jeremy's proposal AFTER she sees the glass doors closing and realises Declan is out of her life
After Anna sets off the fire alarm Jeremy comes in the room and asks if she has everything she NEEDS meaning stuff but as she later explains to Declan ""When her 60 seconds came she realised that what she really needs is in Ireland .""Even Anna's uncharacteristic desperate need to be married ( unlikely in a strong career woman ) is explained by her confession to Declan about her insecure childhood-needing two part time jobs after school -thus finding the security of Jeremy very appealing.This is fully explained in the one deleted scene that should have been included .She explains to her father that her clock is ticking and Jeremy wants to travel before settling down and if she doesn't propose it could be another 3 years wait .Excluding that scene makes Anna seem a tad desperate -it should have been included.These little lines are obviously put in by the director and writers and considerably enhance the film
The film is so popular because Anna and Declan are so likeable and believable and the actors make us want them to be together.It happened One Night was described at the time as the worst film she had made by Colbert but her performance won her an Oscar and is the film that people remembered her by. It's unfashionable for actors to praise romantic comedies and as such Goode and Adams will downplay their performances. I don't -they were both excellent and completely convince as a loving couple -that is the reason this film has such a high rating on google.As Declan says about his Renault 4 ""Shes classic"" and in time this film will be seen as suchThe soundtrack was decent and Gyneth Herbert's version of Only love can break your heart - melts even a cynic like me",Leap Year

First comedy I've seen in a long while that didn't somehow contrive to get the characters into bed with one another in order to further the plot along or convince the audience that they did in fact ""love"" each other.

72,edumacated,i think i broke a heel,6,15 September 2010,"i loved the beginning of this film, sure it's a chick flick, but that just goes to show that the appreciation of good film transcends genre, instead of hemming one in to a specific type.but it was Amy Adams, as well as the slickest of Hollywood camera, scene and editing, that sucked me in at the beginning--the sinking of high heels in to sand almost made me sign the check. and when it comes to Amy--i have seen her play all from pauper to princess, and have observed art in each role.sure, its the same old chick flick--find a real man (although this time it supplied an off accent englishman) on the eve of wedding story, and it uses the Irish in the same old hick way as the jjs in Hollywood usually do, and i actually almost bought that package of goods this time. but when it came to the meat in the sandwich, and consequently; when it came to finding any kind of chemistry between amy and Matthew Goode, i felt like i was watching pinewood trying to recreate an oldtime English love interest between one more woman and the same old private school backside bandit. i've seen more chemistry between a bird and its worm. it was awful.and the worst part is: the Hollywood twerps, the ones who make megabucks, and we entrust our cash before we see the film-- show themselves to be just a bunch of tossers who can come so close to doing something well, and then (exhibit any good done was not by them) push a project all the way down with one casting decision that ruins not only the film, but our meager investment. Hollywood.......",Leap Year
73,ikizdevran-882-254684,"Heads you win, tails I lose.",5,25 May 2018,"If a year has 29th of February that year is called Leap Year. This incident happens once in almost every four years and tradition says that if a woman proposes marriage in this very special day she will have good luck and prosperity in her life. Also her proposal is most likely to be accepted. This tradition or superstition -you may call- is believed to be born out of a special permission granted by St. Patrick to Irish women the right to propose marriage in this day. Since the name of the movie is Leap Year, you can imagine what it is going to be about.Amy is an overly organized girl who doesn't believe in luck. When she finds out about the leap year, she gets on a plane and goes after her boyfriend who is in Dublin for a conference. When plane lands not in Dublin but in Cardiff due to weather conflict she tries to find her own way to get to Dublin before 29th of February to propose to her boyfriend and everything gets even more complicated when she meets an Irish innkeeper Declan who promises to take her to Dublin for a sum of 500 Euros.Before going deep into the reasons, I have to say that this movie is warm and cozy. Rainy weather of Ireland is going to put you right into this mood. Do you remember how you feel when it is raining outside and you are watching the rain drops with a cup of coffee in your hand? This is exactly how one is going to feel while watching this movie. To be honest, this romantic comedy has each and every cliché that a romantic comedy must have. What are they? For example, two opposite characters hating each other at first, Beautiful woman and attractive man, unbelievable or forced coincidences and of course a happy ending. You are going to find all of this in the Leap Year. Eventually audience is aware of how a romantic comedies function. This is exactly why you should ignore those clichés and focus on if this movie was entertaining enough or if you had an enjoyable time watching it. The answer to both is 'yes'. You are going to have a good time watching Leap Year. In addition to this, you are going on a road trip in beautiful Ireland from Dingle to Dublin which is more or less 346 kilometers and getting familiar with their music, people, traditions and inns. In the beginning of the movie you will see some overly exaggerated reactions to her environment by Anna from Boston (Amy Adams). This made me realize it has always been considered funny and annoying how in real life some Americans behave when they get out of their country and can't adapt to diverse cultures and acts like they are still in America. This kind of behaviors have created a common belief in Europe that some Americans have some serious personality issues. The same thoughts apply for our very own Anna from Boston. But don't worry you are going to like her in the end. That being said, Leap Year starring Amy Adams and Matthew Goode is directed by Anand Tucker who started his directing career by directing adverts and factual television programming. He was supposed to be directing Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy but eventually replaced by Chris Weitz. Amy Adams is mostly known for her roles in such as Sunshine Cleaning (2008), The Wedding Date (2005), Doubt (2008), Julie & Julia (2009), The Fighter (2010), Her (2013), American Hustle (2013) and Big Eyes (2014). In all those years she has proven to be a very talented actress and to this date she has five Academy Award Nominations and six British Academy Film Awards and two Golden Globes. By year 2017 she is also one of the highest paid actresses in the world. On the other hand, Matthew Goode known as Declan -which is a traditional Irish name- in Leap Year is known for his roles in such as Chasing Liberty (2004) supporting role in Woody Allen's Match Point (2005), Brideshead Revisited (2008), A Single Man (2009). Interesting enough Matthew Goode admitted that the movie was year's one of the worst and he accepted the role because it allowed him to fly home back to London in the weekends. Amy Adam's and Matthew Goode's performances in the movie are acceptable. I especially liked Declan's voice and I believe this voice suits well with this kind of character. In the supporting roles we see Adam Scott with his perfect hair. His performance fits with the movie without any further comment. Soundtracks are rich and varies from traditional Irish to modern music. Soundtracks were composed and conducted by Randy Edelman. He is also known for his music scores in movies like Ghostbusters II, Kindergarten Cop and The Last of the Mohicans. When the background of a movie is the beautiful Ireland there is not much to talk about cinematography but with the right light and right angles and great close ups in the right moments Newton Thomas Sigel did one hell of a job. Leap Year was shot in Ireland as mentioned before and some of the locations were County Wicklow, Dublin, County Mayo and County Galway. Leap Year was released on 8th of January 2010 with a total budget of 19 million $ and grossed 32.6 million $. The movie has received generally negative reviews and it is loosely based on It Happened One Night which was a movie from the year 1934 directed by Frank Capra starring Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert. Runtime of Leap Year is 100 minutes. So shortly, Leap Year is a highly enjoyable Saturday evening movie. Don't raise your hopes too high and watch it not to be mind blown but to entertain yourself.",Leap Year

Well the best laid plans go asunder and the young lady finds herself a long ways away from were here boyfriend is and having to make a journey across Ireland with a surly Irish Inn owner as her guide.Good supporting performances help this movie a lot.

80,malpasc-391-915380,Unchallenging,7,30 August 2021,"Romantic comedy movies are pretty much unchallenging and don't make Oscar lists, and Leap Year is no exception to this. That said, not all films are made to be high art.Attractive cast, attractive scenery and some funny dialogue save this film from being a total dud.Ireland in this kind of film is always portrayed as slightly soft focus, ""fiddle dee dee"", and full of character stereotypes. Imagine people laughing in pubs and exchanging ""banter"".The plot is predictable - super organised American Anna ends up through increasingly ridiculous circumstances in a small West Coast village and meets Declan, the local publican whose wife left him for another man, so of course he's somewhat seemingly bitter and jaded about romance and the apparent tradition of women asking men to marry them on February 29th - leap day. He ends up being roped in to taking Anna to Dublin to propose to her boyfriend who is apparently at some heart surgeon conference. Through various ridiculous situations Anna and Declan fall for one another, and you can pretty much guess the rest. This film could have been written by an algorithm such is the predictably!That said, it isn't too bad - it's an easy watch, with some decent dialogue in parts and the leads play their cliched roles very well. Just don't expect any surprises or shocks along the way. You know how it will end before it even really starts.Matthew Goode is known as saying he didn't like the film, and perhaps as an actor he has a point.

Not even one smart Irish person is shown.Instead of Irish writers? We have Americans Deborah Kaplan and Harry Elfont with little track record - inexplicably selected, as they have only ever won one award, for worst screenplay! For ""Surviving Christmas"" at the 2005 Raspberry awards.Very glad the superb Amy Adams (net worth $60m and 6 Oscar nominations) absolutely shrugged this one off. Sadly Matthew Goode (net worth $2 million and a winner of only one award, the 2014 Fangoria Chainsaw Award for best supporting actor) fared not so well thereafter.

82,east-emerald,"Oh Amy, move on and forget this one....",6,10 May 2010,"Romcoms (romantic comedies) are often described as light and fluffy but here we will go with flimsy and paper-thin. In a short and shallow set up, we meet Anna (Amy Adams) and her boyfriend. All you need to know about them is that she stages high-end apartments and he is a cardiologist. This tags her as the control freak obsessed with the little details that create perceived perfection. Not much to say about the boyfriend who will from this point forward be referred to as ""the cardiologist"" . He is rich, accomplished and needs the same in a mate. Like so many female movie characters before her Anna yearns for a marriage proposal as the final piece of the puzzle to ""stage"" her life. Said cardiologist is dragging his feet on this matter and disappoints one time too many. He is off to a conference in Dublin and she decides to follow him. We're fed a story about an Irish tradition where women propose to their boyfriends on leap day. This is supposed to supply urgency because she wants the romantic story this trip will supply. However she is so frantic I just wondered what bad things would happen if she proposed on, say, the day after leap day? Would she have been breaking some Irish law against female empowerment?I won't bore you with too many details but bad weather lands her instead in what must be the Irish version of redneck land and at the mercy of Matthew Goode's grumpy innkeeper/taxi driver. He calls her ""idjet""(idiot), she calls him jackass and they are off on the race to true love. I think ""Leap Year"" may have been better served with at least a PG13 rating. The two lovebirds could have expressed their early distaste for each other in some more colorful language and the sexual tension may have been amped up. Also don't worry about the cardiologist.

84,franciscoraposo72,Tx2= Typical and Terrible,3,28 May 2012,"What a terrible movie. They are still not aware that this has been made before, no one is, although there's no other version of Leap Year, I felt like I watched all that, the asked kiss from The Proposal, the arrogant American with the guy that mocks her all the time like in The Proposal, etc. This movie is 100% cliché'd, oh and don't forget about the ending, even if I wrote the ending I wouldn't have to write spoiler alert cause right when I watched the trailer I knew how was it going to wined up. Liked about it, well, I was entertained for 5 or 6 minutes during these 100 minutes and I laughed a couple of times, oh, and don't forget the good photography, but, what about the rest? The rest sucked, the premise, the acting, the storyline, the script, this couldn't possibly be worse, I'm tired of this and people who liked it are people that have seen so much of these unrealistic rom-com's that have been losing a few valuable IQ points. By the way, Amy Adams started a wonderful career, she started well with Charlie Wilson's War and with the amazing PG Disney comedy Enchanted, then she started to develop her career a little more and she starred in The Fighter where she left a sample of her big talent, I admired her career, but I can't believe she went for this, I hope this was just an exception, cause Adams is not the type of arrogant girls from rom-com's that at the end fall in love with her lift. About Matthew Goode, well, he was okay, he offered a few good gags like when he mocked the whole concept of the movie, saying that it was the stupidest thing he's ever heard (I laughed a lot about that), so yeah, he was good, so as for Scott, who never fails to make you laugh. Sow, don't watch Leap Year, it completely sucks and by the way, if you want to watch it because you have interest on the ending, well, let me give you a good piece of advice, watch the movie's trailer, take a look at the movie's poster and then go to a movie website, search for Leap Year, find it and take a look at the cast list and see the actor's order, I think you'll be able to get a 'little' idea of what happens at the end.3/10",Leap Year

86,jonandshellie,"Heart is in the right place, but it falls short",5,14 June 2010,"Although Leap Year has it's heart in the right place, it can not escape its painful case of predictability and the downright awful on-screen chemistry between Amy Adams and Matthew Goode. You got the impression that they despised each other from the outset and any emotional connection between the two was extremely forced and artificial. Unlike when we saw Richard Gere and Julia Roberts in ""Pretty Woman"" and ""Runaway Bride"", or when we saw Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan in ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and ""You've Got Mail"", Adams and Goode did not make us believe that these two people could actually have genuine feelings for each other and be in love. This set a negative tone for the rest of the movie and threw everything out of balance.It just seems like ""Leap Year"" is a formulaic Hollywood ""chick Flick"" that, although has some funny scenes and is somewhat entertaining, brings nothing to the table in way of originality. Not to mention that the majority of John Lithgow's scenes are cut out (the rest can be found in the deleted scenes section of the DVD). The movie could have benefited greatly from more Lithgow, and frankly it boggles my mind how the producers could cut him out from the film as much as they did.Overall, ""Leap Year"" is a decent ""couple hates each other then loves each other"" romance flick, but it is insanely predictable and introduces nothing fresh or original to the genre.",Leap Year
87,WHYeat,Dismissible,4,11 June 2010,"This story is about a woman named Anna, whose job involves ""staging"" homes. She fills empty homes with decor - paintings, rugs, sofas, beds, etc - to attract potential buyers. Buyers just don't know what they want until she shows it to them. Anna's job is analogous to her approach to her relationship with Jeremy, who she has been dating for a while. Jeremy is a busy doctor, but luckily Anna knows exactly what is good for them. This is not a novel idea. Heck, it's mostly true of all relationships, but I'll give the screenwriter some credit and say that the analogy is clever.Before Jeremy's conference in Ireland, he arranges a ""special"" dinner, but arrives with diamond earrings instead of a diamond ring, so Anna decides it is her job to point him in the right direction. Taking matters into her own hands, Anna rushes off to Dublin and draws on an old Irish tradition to propose on Leap Day, February 29th. I run the risk of getting drop-kicked by an angry Irish woman, but I wouldn't want to be proposed to. Why don't I hit the salon and breast feed the kids while I'm at it? Ladies, if you're old fashion like me, drop hints, then nag him, and as a last resort, threaten to leave. Don't propose.Unfortunately (or fortunately), a storm puts a damper on her plans and knocks Anna off course a long ways from Dublin. She tries to go by boat and even on foot, but her best bet is the bartender/innkeeper/taxi driver named Declan. Together, they stumble through the beautiful Irish countryside dodging cows, bad weather, and the occasional lovers' quarrel. But inevitably Anna and Declan go from trading verbal punches to trading loving stares and even swapping spit. Not surprisingly, the romance is trite and contrived. In one situation they must role-play as husband and wife and sleep in the same bed. I suppose if I could write the same story over and over every year and get paid big bucks, I'd do it too.Her journey ends in Dublin, but that magical feeling is still with me til this very day - I""m just messing with you. This movie is easily dismissible and isn't worth the few brain cells I have left to remember. But if you fancy the idea of starting a foreign romance with someone whom you've been acquainted with for only a few days, Leap Year is your type of movie. Furthermore, if you'd throw you inhibitions to the wind and your career in the toilet to then travel to a foreign country to give him/her a try, watch Leap Year and take a leap - metaphorical or literal.Rated Chick",Leap Year

And I'm sure the Irish hate it for all the oirishness. But as a romantic comedy, and that is what this is - not an unforgettable, epic movie, but a romantic comedy - it's pretty fine!

94,StarDragyn,Most fun I've had at a theater in quite a while,9,8 January 2010,"I just got back from the theater under an hour ago, and am still in a good mood after having watched this. Some romantic comedies are more comedy than romance, or more romance than comedy, but this one blends the two into something especially delightful. I left the theater with more of a bounce in my step and a wide smile on my face, despite having had a not so great day.It's not perfectly original--there were parts where I was able to say ahead of time precisely what was going to happen next--but it is not entirely formulaic, either. And there is something comfortable about the familiar, especially if it is done slightly different.Matthew Goode surprised me in his role, and there the originality is quite refreshing. I hadn't realized exactly how limited of roles I am used to seeing the typical ""rom-com"" male fit into, until he kept breaking my expectations. And I like how real Amy Adams is: no harsh looking clavicle bones sticking out, minimal makeup, and her face hasn't been pinched and pulled into a tight canvas.The Irish scenes are gorgeous, and the accents entertaining. And, I don't know if there was anyone else who was pleased, but I was ecstatic at this proof of a great romantic comedy kept within a PG rating. No embarrassing scenes to make mixed company awkward; no offensive profanity. It IS PG, of course, so don't expect ""Little Mermaid"" standards, but it was still incredibly clean for the genre. I have little brothers aged 7 and 9 (who I'm very protective of), and I would not have felt embarrassed to allow them to watch this.Overall, a great show for the genre. The best I've seen in a long time. Not perfect, but if you're in it for entertainment and a feel-good story, rather than as a movie critic, I think you'll really enjoy it.",Leap Year

I did not find it at all funny. There was a good deal of slapstick, but nothing funny. It had also been recommended as showing Ireland at its beautiful best. Ireland is, indeed, beautiful, though very little of it was to be seen in this film. I was also extremely irritated by the obvious contradictions (the Dingle is on the west coast of Ireland, Cork on the East, but when sailing from Cardiff to Ireland in a storm the boat has to ""put in"" at the Dingle when it is bound for Cork!). The Dingle itself is famous for its food and restaurants. It also had a number of great hotels. We were asked to believe that nothing decent in either category could be found by the heroine there. The landscape around Dingle is outstandingly beautiful (the ring of Kerry etc.)The scenes we were shown were clearly not shot there. I know this is not intended as a travelogue, but why be to perversely wrong? All the usual stereotypes were to be seen (superstitious Irish; emotionally cold professional Englishman; posey American) and, of course, the obligatory and completely implausible happy ending. This was rubbish of the first order. I know Dr. Johnson said that one had to suspend disbelief in the theatre, it would seem one now has to suspend all intelligence for this film.",Leap Year

100,jlcdrama,One of the Best Romantic Comedies,8,10 January 2010,"I just got back from the theater and I had to write down my review before the inevitable bashing of all rom coms began.If you are looking for a deep philosophical movie, this isn't for you. If you are looking for an action film, this isn't for you. If you are looking for an epic movie that shatters box office records and leaves you feeling awed by the story, this isn't for you.But, if you are looking for a sterling good time filled with laughter, romance and a small bit of heartache, then this movie is definitely for you.The start of this movie is a bit slow, but I realized that was the intent. Amy Adam's character, Anna, is colorless, cold and a bit spoiled at the start. I actually remarked that ""She needs her feathers ruffled,"" and that is what happened. After being disappointed by her boyfriend's inability to propose, Anna runs off to Dublin to follow an ancient tradition her grandmother did in proposing to her boyfriend on Leap Year. The quest to Dublin introduces Anna to handsome Irish lad Declan who's cynical attitude on love and romance leaves her stunned. Each misstep in their journey brings her to seeing how planning every moment of her life may protect her from unwanted surprises but it will leave her without the joy of those wonderful, spontaneous events. By the end of the movie, Anna is no longer bland and cold, but warm and filled with adventure.Cynical Declan also learns from the adventure. Still nursing a broken heart from his unfaithful fiancé Kaylee, Declan agrees to bring Anna to Dublin in order to save his dilapidated pub. While he enjoys teasing Anna, he also enjoys teaching her how to get her hands dirty and to live in the moment instead of planning every second of her life. Despite their differences, the two find themselves falling in love. When they reach Dublin, Declan find his heart breaking again as he watches Anna's boyfriend Jeremy drop to one knee and ask her to marry him. But instead of falling apart, Declan returns to his pub and is determined to save it.Yes the plot is predictable. No it has no great philosophical meaning to tell, but this story is filled with old fashioned comedy that stems from a love story every woman would wish was her own.",Leap Year

104,Skeptic-8,Delightfully Predictable,8,10 January 2010,"Conceivable spoiler (though I cannot imagine how)Various critics' reviews, and certain of those here, bash this pleasant movie as being ""predictable."" Well, yeah - it's a romantic comedy. Two people try to get together, suffer obstacles, and finally at least one of them winds up with someone. If you don't want a predictable plot, don't see romantic comedies. Predictability aside, this is a delightful version of the genre. Amy Adams has never been so luminously beautiful, and Matthew Goode is scruffily appealing. The Irish countryside, no surprise, is green and glorious, and the obligatory supporting comic rural coots are charming. Yes, Amy's character steps in cow pats and falls in mud, because how else would we know that someone who looks like Amy Adams is less than perfect? And all rom-com characters must have an Achilles heel that makes their opposite number love them. But this sort of pratfall comedy is kept to a minimum, and is cleverly offset by Amy's brave face, soldiering on despite adversity. Essentially, this film is an old-fashioned version of the brand. It is not heavily weighted towards sex, debauchery and crudeness as such recent offerings as The Ugly Truth have been. Rather, this film lets us get to know the two main characters, feel the way they inch towards one another, and enjoy the scenery along the way. Really, what more could you ask for in a romantic comedy than a light-touch love story with two attractive characters in a wild and lush countryside? Not much, I submit.",Leap Year

OK so not to bore with the usual scenario about the movie at this point but for me it was very predictable and boring. The movie trailers were so incredibly cute and funny that I just had to see this movie. BORING. Matthew Goode is real eye-candy with the back-drop of the gorgeous scenery of Ireland and his, I think, supposedly Irish accent. Amy Adams has been so perky and adorable on all the talk shows that enticed me to go to see this movie. I am not sure that the obnoxious Anna (Amy Adams) actually comes to terms of how annoying, self-centered and controlling she really is when the movie ends. She makes things seem to always go her way in her adult life even up through to the end of the movie. Yes she got mud on her fancy clothes and poop on her $600 shoes but no real scars of life for lessons learned. Good TV movie to watch if nothing else is cooking on FoodTV.",Leap Year
106,heartcore9,"Fun, sweet romance w/two great actors",9,9 June 2015,"This is a sweet, funny romantic comedy. It's silly at times. However, what's silly about it is the situations and some of the plot points. On the flip side, the actors are great dramatic actors and the dialogue isn't over the top silly, so the performances and moments between the two main characters bring it down to earth.Now keep in mind that the premise of this story is about a woman who dashes off to Ireland to propose marriage to her boyfriend Leap Day, because according to Irish tradition, a man who receives a marriage proposal on a leap day must accept it. Bright idea, right? So therefore, you've been warned before you even turn this movie on that it is time to suspend some disbelief and enter the world of light, fun romance. I watch a fair number of romantic comedies, and to me, this is one of the better ones because it is funny but it has a lot of heart. Amy Adams is luminous as always, and Matthew Goode is really hilarious when he needs to be, and soulful when it calls for it. The big bonus to this movie is the atmosphere, scenery, and locations!

The Ireland landscape scenes were drop dead beautiful - as expected. The tune of the movie was in harmony with everything in the movie, the music, colors, the staging; everything. And we were not expecting an Oscar movie with this plot so, what was the disappointment that drove this movie under 7 I wondered. When I checked out the reviews I realized it was only down 7 because Irish people (and people around UK) gave it bad points! Why? Because it was inaccurate about ferry times and that amazing landscapes whereabouts, and stereotyping about old Irish folk, and an outside February wedding in Ireland and blah blah blah... Come on! Look, I am from Turkey and I know Hollywood stereotyping really good so, let me tell you something, even if it was stereotyping, it didn't feel like it and we fell in love with Ireland!

I love the chemistry that the two main characters-Mathew Goode and Amy Adams share, and the funny little scenes that just stick to my mind, such as her trying to plug her phone in and the power goes out in the whole village, how he teases her about ""Louie""- her suitcase, the wedding scene when she very nearly ruins the wedding and many many other little scenes... But I also can understand why some Irish people watching this might be slightly? offended- the portrayal of Irish people drinking all day in pubs, there been no form of public transport in rural Ireland, their backwardness and their almost religious belief in old sayings/traditions etc If you can lighten yourself up and watch this, (without been Irish) I really think this is one film that many people can enjoy!",Leap Year

126,dermotmoconnor,Diddlee-eyeing its way across Ireland,1,26 September 2020,"Found this gem through it being mentioned on the Motherfoclóir podcast.
Not since the execrable 'Sons of Anarchy' has there been such a fever-dream version of Ireland. There's a stripe of American who thinks the country is stuck 50 years in the past forever. Note to such 'auteurs': there's a wonderful new search website called ""go ogle"". You can type things into ""go ogle"" like""What does Dingle look like?""
or
""Do Irish people have celphones?""
or
""Do Irish people eat tripe?""
or
""How long does it take to sail from Cardiff to Dingle?""
or
""What kinds of cars do the Irish drive?
or
""Do Irish buses run on Sunday?"", etc etc etcFirst the big stuff: unlikeable characters (OK to start with them, not OK to end with them). Character arc, baby. We used to do them.But it's the portrayal of Ireland that was phantasmagorical, even by Hollywood standards.
The yokel pub scene is to be expected. The 'comic yokel relief' of the aul lads arguing was stale shtick, but the drunken man falling over was gross. Yeah, he was going to drive her to dublin but he was too drunk to walk, hahaha the irish amirite? Actually no you're not. Biggest tea drinkers are not the English but the Irish, and the biggest drinkers are the English not the Irish. Go ogle.So her flight can't land in Dublin (apparently the only airport in Ireland). Could have just landed in Shannon. Oh wait we can't afford a research assistant.""Go ogle: other airports in Ireland"" would have told them about Shannon and presto our character is in ""deh wesht"" and can enjoy the bucolic delights of Tuam. But no, in Hollywood there is only one airport, so we must redirect to wales. Where (contrary to fact) welsh people are awful.The opening insanity is the boat trip from Cardiff (there are no ferries from Cardiff, you'd leave from Holyhead, but I guess Americans wouldn't understand that). Still, even in the big ships that's a 2 hour travel time at least, but the Bauld Amy commandeers a small fishing ship and manages to reach Dingle (on the opposite side of Ireland) with time to spare. If the short trip is 2 hours in a huge ferry, she's surely losing at least half a day or a day with her cinematic trip to the wrong side of the country. Or, she could have waited for the next flight.But I guess they wanted to get her to 'Deh Real Oireland' where ""Deh real Oirish"" still live.Fever-dream stuff.It goes downhill from there. I found the atmosphere anything but charming, actually intensely claustrophobic. In a country with one (old) car, maybe two, the inability to manage a very simple trip to Dublin actually feels Kafkaesque. The constant phone-on-the-wall business was just deranged, in a country where there are more mobile phones than people - by 2010 the market was saturated. The P&T boxes = whatever production company was dressing the sets must have been amazed to find out that they were working on a movie set in 2010, and not 1990.There's so much to mention: the gruesome dinner kissing scene with the Italians. No conservative Irish couple would be OK with that - they'd squirm. Certainly none of the ""go on ya boy ya give yer wife a good one yaroo!"" madness. Don't get me started on the tripe. Isn't that more of a Northern English thing? Circa 1965?Compulsory fight scene (because deh oirish dey're always foitin). Oh, god, the scene where Declan and the guy in the van spit and shake on their deal - no, hollywood, just no. Please stop, I'm asking nicely. Please.The band he was playing in the care was a Boston American-Irish group, so we know this isn't exactly being marketed to the Irish.

If you are Ireland bound for the first time, you really should watch this movie. It is the scenery and locations that will blow you away, knock your socks off and leave you wanting to get there sooner.

Ireland isn't so bad, either, but Director Anand Tucker manages to keep the lens tight on the two stars rather than the sumptuous countryside, with only a couple of exceptions. So while there is a decent feast for the eyes, for the brain? Not so much.Every move is telegraphed, every plot twist tortuously engineered; heck, Lucy Ricardo had more subtlety setting up contrivances, every next scene is a rehash of an endless line of romantic comedies, and there are barely a couple of giggles along the way. If it were not for the denouement in the final 10 minutes, the 2-minute preview would have sufficed.Which is a shame, because Adams has shown that she has the chops to carry a picture, and Goode buttresses his part well enough, but somehow the anti-chemistry never dissolves into believable passion, and with the paucity of real humor, this turns out not to be either very romantic, or very much comedy.Still, if you love Amy Adams (as I do), it's probably worth a look, otherwise, look elsewhere.",Leap Year

I couldn't root for any of the two leads because one was annoyingly dumb and selfish and the other a jerk. One trope in movies I really hate is when they romanticize emotional and physical cheating then root for the characters that did this. There was only ""emotional"" connection, a very intimate kiss (and an almost second kiss), but in my opinion it's still awful and not romantic. Also, how did the two fall in love exactly? All they did was bicker, fight and annoy each other. It could be lust, but definitely not love because there was absolutely nothing romantic about their interactions. No chemistry or tension whatsoever.After all of what happened, and finally the female character ( I can't even remember her name) finds her boyfriend, and he actually proposes to her before she tries to. I stopped watching after this because I knew she'd break off the engagement for that guy, and as I guessed based on what I read in some of the reviews here the female character leaves her good bf/fiancé right after he proposes to her or before marriage because she ""realizes"" that she's in love with someone else.

She had one emotion the entire length of the film, whether she was walking in ridiculous high heels through the Irish countryside or sitting at the dinner table with her boyfriend. She should stick to visiting The Office. The camera work was poorly done. At one point the camera looks straight on into the sun. If silhouettes was what they were going for they did it the wrong way. Making an audience endure staring straight into the sun is not good camera work.

139,jeanpierre15,I liked it and I have high expectations.,6,11 January 2010,"I generally have high expectations and am just accustomed to be disappointed by most films, even--mostly dramas but i know a tolerable romcom when I see one. Be warned, I might of just liked this because Matthew Goode is very interesting to watch as he differs in his ploying of charisma from character to character. As Ebert said, it's a quirky and fun ride because Goode and Adams have excellent chemistry. So it's a romcom, it's predictable but with the nuance of displaying the majestic countryside as integral to the plot's procession rather than proselytizing it like some 'roided-out-bankrupted-government's travel brochure, the film remains very watchable. Take heed green children of Ireland, the caricatures and cultural stereotypes can be a wee bit tired, not to say tiring as well. Fun, though probably not worth seeing over some other films out there this time of year, but definitely over staying-in if rewatching an older flick or finally walking the dog just doesn't do the effort committed any justice. Engaged within the story, it had me hating myself for enjoying such a throwaway narrative but completely lost me at the final five minutes--at which point my bladder reminded me I need to spray my name in cursive on a urinal. MINOR SPOILER;Similar to the conclusion of LOTR, the film has like three endings and can't decide HOW it wants the audience to feel a way, though it knows exactly WHAT they want the audience to feel, so it takes a weird and almost insecurely tacked on 'shotgun' approach. And to be completely honest, I would have rather preferred it to end after Anna boarded her flight, betrothed and leaving Ireland, and then seen a subtle denouement, but maybe I am still suffering post-(500)-Days-of-Summer-syndrome, in thinking I can get it the way the real world is and be left with a strange masochistic desire to be gutted and an unabashed sadistic addition for dissatisfaction, rather than generic convention.",Leap Year
140,michawheeler,Average rom-com with beautiful scenery,5,23 May 2010,"Well, I knew I had picked a rom-com so I shouldn't complain for getting a rom-com. I just wish they would think of something different. Is it that difficult to come up with a new idea? I'm going to start to believe that city girls actually have no sense and no pain receptors in their feet (how else could they totter cross country in five inch heels?). I mean, really, we see one girl after the other being stranded in the middle of nowhere and they all, without exception, behave like spoilt idiots. Haven't they seen a romantic comedy?I don't have anything cynical to say about Amy Adams' performance. She doesn't over-egg the city girl attitude and her character comes across as a nice and smart girl. What baffles me is why Adams would pick a film like this one, she can do so much better. I didn't alway understand what Matthew Goode was saying and his performance was OK, it improved as the film progressed and his best moments were, I felt, when he didn't say anything (which is a compliment). Overall the mediocre plot was saved by the two lead performances and their chemistry. The supporting acts were pretty degenerate. I'm sure that Irish men have more things to talk about than just stuff that brings bad luck. The obligatory best-friend-with-an-attitude was also there, she did what was expected of her in the time at which they are expected.My final verdict is; if you're a girl or a gay guy (I had to say gay because I have never met a straight one who is fond of rom-coms yet) who likes rom-coms, this is a very standard example and you'll probably like it.

It's not unwatchable, just unexpectedly sadistic at times (there are pratfalls and accidents galore for the sake of ""laughs""). The plot is a standard fish out of water/ romantic comedy, where a snooty American gets taken down a notch or two by country folk.

The problem for me was the over-the-top corny and trying-really-hard-to-be-awkward-yet-funny bits. There were too many moments when I thought ""Oh no, they didn't --- UUUUUGH, yeah, they did. That sucks."" Without the ridiculously predictable and (for lack of a better word) stupid moments, this could have been a great film. It felt too scripted, like it tried too hard to create painful, awkward, and touching scenes. Right when I would start to get into the characters and the story, the mood or scene would shift into a forced, trying-too-hard feel. It played the jokes and scenes done a million times, and it just wasn't funny or touching. Period.The scenery is gorgeous, and Matthew Goode does a great job with what he is given to work with. To be fair, Amy Adams does as well. Her character is just annoying for the most part. She's hard to like, and that hurt my attempts to get into the plot.If the film had been allowed to stick to a simple, genuine feel, it could have been great. Instead, it inserted awful comedic ploys and offered overly dramatic misses. And the music choices, for the most part, were terrible. Again, too cliché with their ""love"" references way too early in the film, and it didn't get better as it went on. Too much, too overdone. As I said, I really wanted to like it!

(Okay, maybe sometimes we would, but we still love the ones that take us through the same old predictable routine.)This time the quirky girl is Anna (played by Amy Adams), the cocky guy is Declan (Matthew Goode), and the bickering is about Anna's determination to get to Dublin, Ireland, in time to propose to her boyfriend (Adam Scott) on Leap Day and Declan's determination to antagonize her as she gets knocked off course every step of the way. Anna, who is routine and rigid and has her life meticulously planned out (as well as this trip), hires Declan, a hotel manager/cook/taxi driver who's not so much of a planner as he is a spontaneous free faller, to drive her as far to Dublin as he can. But after a scuffle over a cassette tape, a blockade of cows in the road, a car that flies off a curve, and a stolen suitcase named Louis, Declan becomes more of an irksome escort than a taxi driver (seeing as how the taxi is in a ditch).But jumping through all these hoops makes Anna wonder if she's on a mission to propose to the wrong guy. Her insistence on living her life and making her decisions according to a detailed schedule hasn't gotten her where she expected, so maybe veering off course is fated to show her that the cocky guy who doesn't have his whole life in order is the one she should've been looking at all along.",Leap Year

However, rather than to surprise her boyfriend force unforeseen circumstances, it comes in a small town in Ireland and here, in a restaurant, is introduced to Declan, its opposite - cold and rough young men in the interpretation of the English actor Matthew Goody. So, the adventure can begin ... Full of comical scenes, original dialogue and great acting, the film looks really full attention. As for the music theme, give special charm to the story.

have to get my account up to date to say what I think... Wonderful romantic movie,
just wonderful... I have it now on DVD but it comes up on Netflix so I watched it again. Amy Adams is lovely to look at, an exceptional actress, she can be funny and serious, Mathew Goode yeah I like him a lot in all his movie roles...
So many positive reviews here, I have to add mine... one of my very favourite movies... The fun and comedy, the gradual romance, the landscape (who cares if the cliffs are in a different actual location??) the background music, and finally the romantic ending... gotta say... one of my favourite movies... did I already say so?

167,BloodyMari87,Enjoyable,7,9 January 2012,"When it comes to romantic comedies, I have been, admittedly, difficult to please. I often stray from films such as this one because they're so unbelievably unrealistic. But, I have learned that there is truly something magical about rather unrealistic romantic comedies, when done well. I think this movie contains aspects that are incredibly unrealistic. The film is peppered with inaccuracies about Ireland that boarder on racist. And yet, it's completely enjoyable. If you put away the microscope and look at the movie as a whole, I can almost guarantee a fan of romantic comedies will enjoy it. It's funny and sweet, silly and cliché, and unrealistically romantic. It is a work of pure fiction and fantasy and that is made very clear. But that's part of what makes it fun. We all know that fairy tales aren't real. No knight in shining armor is going to ride his white horse to save you from some dragon, for you do not live in a castle and he has no dragon to slay. But it's movies like these that allow us to escape to a world where these things do happen. So is it a masterpiece? No. Is it completely accurate? Not at all. Is it still worth watching just for fun? Absolutely.",Leap Year

But her trip to Dublin is not as easy as she thought it would be...This is not ridiculous or predictable like many movies that are in the theater. The actors are great. Amy acts beautifully and she's so funny. The story is just refreshing, fun and sweet, a perfect romantic comedy, I could say.

170,samuel_morton,A very fun movie,7,24 October 2010,"I am one of those people who enjoy romantic comedies, but have experienced so many cliché plots, poor dialogue and just not very feel good feel. Yet I am please to record Leap Year was a fresh relief. Although Leap Year does contain many cliché movie moments: getting wet in the rain, falling in mud, characters forced to share the same bed etc, there are many aspects which makes this movie unique and memorable. First, the casting. Amy Adams and Matthew Goode worked extremely well together, but it was the Irish minor characters that really reinforced the leads performances. It was a shame not to see more of John Lithgow, considering he is such an excellent actor and was only used in one scene. Second, the plot. I think the leap year idea was always going to be a bit tenuous if this was what was driving the script. Yet the writers did well to use it as a hook and kept story moving. I particularly enjoyed the building of the relationship between Anna and Decclan. It was nice that it slow and steady, and there was no random sex scene which was out of beat with the plot.Finally, something must be said about the Irish location. The scenery was breath taking and really gave Leap Year something unique.As Anna was discovering the beauty of Ireland, so were the audience too. All in all, a very fun, moving and enjoyable movie",Leap Year

AMY ADAMAS was good and i found the movie quite romantic.This movie could be an ideal pick for guys who would like to take their girlfriends for a good movie cause in my view they would be very happy after u do so.now about the bad part the starting of the movie was quite boring you witness a girl who likes everything planned and hates surprises. well the first half hour of the story wile really make you wanna skip it.After that the plot changes as she decides to go to Ireland.

172,Silverquill,Enjoyment of a genre generic movie rests largely on acting,5,31 March 2011,"And this movie delivers in terms of acting. Beautiful scenery and in it a girl meets boy story..only the girl wants to make a romantic proposal to her fiancée, who is not the type to appreciate her spirited ideas. So she enlists the help of Declan, a somewhat rough and tumble chap and his little old car. They travel through Ireland, which naturally brings them closer. They are challenged to a kiss, which is a traditional trick to point to the obvious attraction between the two.It works though, between Amy Adams and Mathew Goode, it does. It's a quaint little story that is nice to watch on a rainy day. The writing isn't bad- the very fact you can sit back and enjoy it without flinching is a good sign. Therre will be tired romantic comedies in which this kind if pleasant hour and and a half will be impossible- and that is usually the down-line bottom of genre generic cinema/ TV. This one isn't there, this one is somewhere in the middle and the idea of leap year proposal is appealing for a romantic comedy. It is, simply, put a good, quaint love story. Nothing else.Though the ending is somewhat objectionable Not in the fact that they've only knew each other for three days. It's a romantic comedy, of course the proposal will be made within two or seven days from initial meeting, what I find questionable is the fact that she says I never IN MY LIFe though I'd see you down on your knee. As is she'd known him for ages. But then again, I suppose you could put it down to the journey and adventures along as a bridge that brings close enough for her to say that, though of course that is something of a final stretch.All in all, an enjoyable flick with good acting and nice scenery You do not really want anything more from such movies.

Frustrated, Anna decides to take matters into her own hands and follow Jeremy to Dublin, where he is attending a cardiologist conference. An old Irish tradition holds that if a woman proposes to a man on February 29th in a leap year, he must accept. Due to unforeseen circumstances, Anna ends up in a small coastal village called Dingle. There she meets Declan O'Callaghan (Matthew Goode), a gruff Irish innkeeper. Determined to reach the capital city by leap day, Anna enlists Declan to accompany her to Dublin. Several misfortunes later, she is finally reunited with Jeremy. What becomes of Declan? You'll just have to see it to find out!""Leap Year"" is a delightful romantic comedy romp through the Irish countryside.

The things we do for love. The story line was the typical boy/girl meet, hate at first glance, which was preposterous, totally unbelievable. The dialogue for the most part was unnatural, stilted. The average February temperature in that area is 46F yet it looks like spring. There are new leaves on trees, a veggie garden, people in short sleeves. Yet Declan never takes his heavy coat off. The plot devices used to push the story along were just so weak, hard to believe that anything would actually happen that way. And the wedding that they crash in the most contrived way (on a Sunday?) to get away from hail? She's in this big rush, yet stays for the reception so there can be more contrived, unworkable scenes.

184,nazlie1,Take a flying leap past Leap Year,4,16 April 2010,"There's something about the bleak Irish countryside that is the epitome of romance. The expansive green rolling fields stretching for miles and miles and wild waves crashing against craggy cliffs may make you want to fall madly in love ... not to mention the dark, brooding Irishmen everywhere. Sadly, none of these things can turn a less than average romantic comedy into a great one.Leap Year is entirely predictable as a chick flick. There's the perfectly polished American, Anna Brady (Amy Adams), who runs after her long-term boyfriend to propose on Leap Day - an Irish tradition ... and (sigh) he's luckily just flown to Ireland. One may be able to overlook the cheesiness of this part of the story, if that was the beginning and end of it. But of course, she has several misadventures while travelling to Ireland and meets none other than the dark, brooding Irishman, Declan O'Callaghan (Matthew Goode). He may be the only good thing in the movie too.As far as predictability goes, you can easily hazard a guess the ending. Not all the magnificent cinematography, the remote towns dotted with quaint cottages and the warm Irish sense of humour can detract from the weak storyline. The movie has too many elements and underdeveloped characters to hook the audience. Again these may be overlooked, but the glaring comparison between the slick city Americans and the yobbo, rural Irish folk are far too annoying, not to mention ... predictable. All too often we are reminded of how the Irish countryside can really ruin a polished American girl's day. These scenes are not only painfully annoying to watch, but left me feeling uncomfortable as a non-American. I felt sorry for beautiful Ireland who looked like it came out second best against USA, despite the (predictable) ending.A disappointing performance by Amy Adams,who usually brings such comedic substance to a character. This one falls far short of what we have come to expect from her. It may be her cheesy lines or seeing her totter on extraordinary high heels throughout the movie that makes her character mind-gratingly annoying. Or, it may be that the character is simply over-acted. Whatever the reason, her character leaves much to be desired from a leading damsel-in-distress. Also, the plot is completely lost in all the elements of the story and one may wonder why it is called ""Leap Year"" by the end of the movie. Or is the unpredictability in the title? Maybe a better title would have been ""The Proposal In Ireland""? Same movie, different setting.Having said that, this movie may have genuine chick flick appeal, so if you've had a hectic week and just want to kick off your shoes and switch off your brain for a couple of hours, you may enjoy it!",Leap Year

If you're looking for a comfy, good-feel film, you are definitely right with this one and even get more than that. What I really liked was the Irish setting, it's beautiful and sets a great atmosphere. The film is topped with wit and some not so predictable fun moments and simply allows to sit back and watch the easy and working chemistry between the main characters, and the Irish people they meet along their way. The 10, because I got more than what I wished for, and it was exactly what I wanted and needed in that moment: A cute, clumsy, smart and happy romantic comedy and I enjoyed every bit.

Little did I know. The plot was ridiculous (and i'm allowing for the fact that rom-com plots are often silly).

She senses he's about to propose but doesn't so she decides to surprise him in Dublin and propose on leap day.

She ends up in a small village where super handsome Matthew Goode (Declan) awaitsIt's the classic hate at first, love later relationship but Declan still agrees to drive her to Dublin because he needs the money. 
After his car breaks, he rides the bus with her to Dublin: why a guy she's only known for 12 hours agrees to go on the bus with her is really beyond me. Anyway they are clearly into each other but she accepts her boyfriend's proposal anyway only to flee later, after a way too stupid scene (she pulls the fire alarm of their apartment and we see Jeremy picking up stuff but not care about her. Girl, it's not like the apartment is on fire. Chill.)She goes back to Ireland (it makes total sense to give up one's job and life for someone you kissed once, doesn't it?) where he PROPOSES.

I think I would have enjoyed it more had I not seen and enjoyed Chasing Liberty so much-I pretty much said all I wanted to say, but the review has to be 10 lines.. so I will ramble more about it-They were older than the characters in Chasing Liberty, and she wasn't the President's daughter, and it was in Ireland instead of Europe-but other than that pretty much the same plot-that was disappointing-It was like watching a OK version of Chasing Liberty",Leap Year
204,ihavis21,An average ROM-com with some nice scenery,6,6 January 2010,"Whoever said the trailer gives it away is bang on. That two minute summary gives away most of the plot and funny and romantic scenes. The chemistry here is really not that strong. It's a standard premise. Girl is in a relationship with guy who is married to his career and there is no chemistry there. She goes to Ireland to marry him on leap year when surprise, surprise everything that can possibly goes wrong, goes wrong. This is where we need to suspend our beliefs and let imagination take over. A blackberry can wipe out a small town's electricity. A girl somehow lands in the middle of nowhere because of constant horrible weather after being rerouted for about two days. Then, mysteriously, her journey has one small rain shower and that's about it. Every step is predictable. I won't give away any spoilers. But after about twenty minutes, you can pretty much guess the rest and it won't be hard. I love Ebert's quote on Pelham 123, ""There isn't much wrong with this movie but there isn't much else that's right either."" Or something like that. This is an okay date movie or something you can take your parents to without being embarrassed by nudity or overly suggestive content. Certainly a decent family movie but the kids will be bored.

She is selfish and materialistic and simply idiotic--a horribly dimwitted American woman in a foreign country, not even trying to understand the other culture, its people, or anything else. I can't relate to her (thank god) and I certainly can't imagine how her boyfriend character dated her for 4 years, let alone how anyone is expected to fall in love with an marry her. Yuck. As for the male lead--he is overshadowed by his counterpart's stupidity, but what I did notice of him was rather shallow and uninteresting. A short summary?

216,boost94951,Interesting chemistry makes this Rom-Com stand out,7,11 June 2010,"I rented this movie recently. On my first viewing, my initial reaction was,""Oh, boy. Nothing surprising in the least."" But my kids liked it, and so after viewing it a few more times with them, I realized there are things that make this movie surprisingly emotionally satisfying. Most of what made the movie increasingly interesting for me to watch was the performance of the lead actor Matthew Goode. Something in the inflection and timbre of his voice made every scene he was in a pleasure to watch. His body language and facial expressions were artfully appropriate, not overdone or wooden, and the range of expression was much wider than I have seen in many other lead actors. There is a moment in the latter part of the movie which I think is the most perfect moment of any movie I have ever watched, in which Declan expresses a mixture of menace, contempt, pain, and anger in a manner so pleasant that it is chilling. A moment that belongs in a movie like ""Miller's Crossing.""I cannot leave out the performance of Amy Adams as a counterpoint to the events of the plot. Although the film sets her up as an aggressive social climber, her reactions to the events that she creates and the ones that unfold about her are more reminiscent of a woman afraid of the struggles of her past rather than disdainful of a lower society, which it seems in the beginning. Although her performance is uneven in several portions of the film, her facial expressions in several scenes convey so much with an unusual sort of delicacy. It was captivating to watch her as well in them.Otherwise, I saw the plot and structure of Leap Year as an empty wooden box, more a vehicle constructed to accent the beauty and motion of the people within it rather than a coherent framework to incorporate ideas greater than the sum of its parts. Also, it sounds as if Jeremy was a cardiothoracic surgeon, not a cardiologist, and there are no known surgeries of the aorta that involve an approach from the spine, unless it's in a battlefield.",Leap Year
217,escapeintofilm,Worth seeing: Matthew Goode and Ireland,5,9 January 2010,"Not a bad little movie, but not one of my favorites. Hard to follow at first and a little too obvious throughout. The editing was messy in places and there were quite a few discontinuities. I found Matthew Goode very attractive and perfect for the role of Declan. I look forward to seeing more of him in the future! At times, he spoke so fast (like the Irish) that some of the dialogue was unintelligible to me. I like Amy Adams, but wasn't impressed with her performance in this film. She wowed us in ""Enchanted"", but not in ""Leap Year"". And what was with the clunky high-heeled shoes worn throughout the entire movie? I know of no woman (me included) that would go overseas with only one pair of shoes. If she truly did all that walking on paved roads, she would have blisters and pain after a short while. Most women would walk barefoot and carry the shoes. Amy's high-heeled gait was unattractive and painful to watch. (Probably because she truly had sores on her feet? or hemorrhoids?)Actresses that could have played this role more believably: Meg Ryan, Sandra Bullock, Kirsten Dunst, Amanda Bynes, Renee Zellweger, Helen Hunt, Scarlett JohanssonLest I forget, the scenery of Ireland's countryside was breathtaking.

Her character, Anna, is sweet and vulnerable, but self-reliant when she has to be. The male actors support Ms Adams admirably and the pace never lags, thanks to competent direction of Anand Tucker. The Irish countryside is spectacular. The story is a variation on an old theme, but it is retold in movies because it is a good one.

Her charm is uncanny, and she is obviously gorgeous. To me, she can do no wrong, and in this film she's at the top of her game.The most pleasant surprise was British actor Matthew Goode. Not only is he handsome in a very realistic and believable way, he's also very funny and obviously an amazingly gifted actor who is about to become a major Hollywood player.Finally, the third star of this movie is the setting.

Her seemingly perfect life is accompanied by a perfect boyfriend who only needs to propose to make things, well....perfect. Anna is convinced he will pop the question as he takes her out for a special date at a nice restaurant and presents her with a tiny square box from an exclusive jewelry store. Inside....is a pair of diamond solitaire earrings. Mr. Perfect jets off to a conference in Dublin, Ireland leaving Anna confused. As she mulls over why she is not engaged she remembers the conversation she conveniently had with her father hours earlier. One of her Irish ancestors proposed to a man on Leap Day, which is apparently on old Irish tradition, so Anna decides to hop the pond and propose to her boyfriend. With only days to make this happen a predictable series of obstacles including a local, rugged Irishman get in her way and force Anna to really consider why she's doing what she's doing. While the movie plays out along familiar paths it still holds a few clever lines and some engaging scenes. We are treated to a romantic Ireland of small village pubs and inns and ancient ruined castles. The cast of supporting characters are charmingly two dimensional. Amy Adams turns in a chick-flick worthy performance with little depth and Michael Goode is the likable rough around the edges love interest. We've seen this before, we've loved it before. It's worth seeing again. Leap Year probably won't win any Oscars, but it's a feel-good love story that's pretty to look at. Enjoy it for what it is.",Leap Year

This film is light-hearted with a laugh at every corner. If you're as conservative a mother as I am, you have nothing to worry about in this film. There are a few ""awkward"" parts; once when Anna (Amy Adams) is getting dressed. She's in her underwear, and Declan (Matthew Goode) walks in. There is no sexual interaction or undertone of any sort. The second awkward scene is when Anna and Declan pretend to be married so they can have the last room at a bed and breakfast in the middle of nowhere.

In Leap Year, Anna (an American tourist) has no desire to impress Declan (a cynical innkeeper) because her goal is to get to Dublin to propose to her American boyfriend. The characters are free to travel as they like. Type A Anna pushes far ahead of Type B Declan who tends to drag along. They only speak to each other if they have something to say that the other one doesn't want to hear. This pattern is their language.Anna (Amy Adams) differs from Julie (Julie & Julia) by refusing to give up her Dublin destination. Declan (Matthew Goode) differs from Charles (Brideshead Revisited) by making his own rules and not being governed by those who live in a glass house community.

Anna of course has so many problems to overcome just to get to him by February 29th. The largest hurdle is getting the help of a local, Declan, played by Matthew Goode. I felt like so much of the Irish accents, and the portrayal of a typical Irish bar were a little overdone. Why is it even in Ireland, when there is a bar fight they play country banjo music, it all seemed a little bit of a cliché. Throughout this movie I couldn't get enough of the beautiful scenes of Ireland. I would love to go to Dublin just to stand by the creek with water rolling over the rocks along with the cliffs overlooking the ocean. These cliffs of Dublin and that old castle brought me more joy than the love triangle between Declan, Anna and Jeremy. This movie was so much like other romantic movies, very simple storyline, where nothing unexpected happens. I knew coming in what to expect of this film, so I cannot say that I am surprised by the plot and outcome. If you were to compare it to another movie I would say it comes close to Bridget Jones Diary. With the love triangle and the less than perfect guy wins the girl.John Lithgow had such a small part but makes an impression. I wish they would have shown more of him in this movie. There are very few funny scenes, except when Anna is falling down the hill from the castle in the poring rain. Otherwise this movie really did not have much humor.I was pleasantly surprised by the beautiful Irish music. Initially I was disappointed by the choice of music, but then it hit a point in the movie where there was such a variety of Irish music. There are several scenes where the music outshines the actual scene and actors. There are several scenes where the natural light and outdoor scenery is well placed. The green of the hills with the gray rocks looks beautiful against the blue sky. I also love the play with different low lighting in the pub and later the use of high lighting in the pub to better reflect the changes in Declan.Every bump in Anna's road to Jeremy brings her closer to Declan.

Sometimes when they give a bad review, it only encourages me to want to view the film even more. You may not like the actors; or the chemistry just isn't there; poor script or directing, whatever the case may be, I don't think this was so with Leap Year (rated PG). Sure, there were a few flaws; choppy scenes or too many close-ups when a panoramic view would have been better in a particular scene. Overall I found Leap Year to be very entertaining, refreshing and delightful, with the help of Goode and Adams. Not to mention that Ireland is breathtakingly beautiful. To me, this film was as charming and enchanting as its main actors; beautiful and delightful Amy Adams, and sexy, laid-back Matthew Goode. (He'd make a great Bond someday, with a bit more buffing up, that is.) Even tho Goode has bashed this film or his work, that is, he showed that he has range. I enjoyed all the actors, as well as the extras from the various villages of Ireland. In the bonus portion of the DVD, I noticed a few scenes were eliminated. Those scenes should have been left in. They gave the film more meaning. I had been following Amy Adams' career since Enchanted and found her to be a class act. Loved her in The Fighter and Sunshine Cleaning (Emily Blunt and Alan Arkin were great, too). Amy is a credit to her profession, and a shining star. Matthew Goode surprised me. I loved his portrayal of Declan, his character. Goode is tall, good-looking, kinda' lanky, but in this film he wears a beard (not a full one), and looked more mature and seemed to have had a few extra pounds on him, which is a plus for this dude. He was funny, rude, gruff, playful, compassionate, and sexy. He was Anna's protector--her Superman, so to speak. I found that endearing about him. She was attractive, materialistic; a savvy hard worker. Somehow, Declan helps her to getting her priorities straight. I loved Amy's character, Anna, but wearing 3-inch heels throughout the entire movie was unrealistic. Case in point, one particular scene where Anna and Declan climb the hill to see the castle--I know ""Louie V.,(the luggage, must have had at least one pair of flat shoes or sneakers in there somewhere, but that's make believe for you. Nevertheless, I enjoyed this movie so much that I recently ordered a couple of DVD's as gifts and bought one for me, naturally. If Goode had turned down the role of Declan, I think Colin Farrell, Christian Bale, or even James McAvoy would have done a great job. The only advice I would give to any actor is to enunciate. But thank God for subtitling, it came in handy. I had to refer to it a few times, and it made more sense to me what Declan was relaying-- Irish expressions such as: fecking, ijiot, and shite! Leap Year was a breath of fresh air, and I chuckled several times during the film, plus the writer had me wondering about the ending because he manages to sidetrack us. Smart move! I saw a movie with Janeane Garofalo and off-beat, sexy David O'Hara entitled, The Matchmaker (1997, rated R), which also takes place in Ireland, and I really dig both these actors and the storyline, but not as much as I enjoyed Leap Year. Leap Year is an adventure and it's appropriate enough for even Goode and Adams children to view someday. However, I would have changed a few things in the storyline--a little more affection and passion between Goode and Adams. And, too, not once did Anna and Declan proclaim their love for one another, but they didn't have to; they said it with their very expressive eyes. I'd like to see them work together again, perhaps in a suspense - thriller -action movie. Who knows? Adams and Goode had the chemistry but somebody held back a bit in the kissing scene at the Bed and Breakfast. The best kiss was that of the middle-aged, Italian couple. Still, it's a good film. If you want to unwind and relax, this is the movie for you. Also, Adam Scott was wonderful as Jeremy, and in one of his interviews he makes mention of Amy Adams' talent, and was very complimentary of her. He's such a gentleman and so sweet and unpretentious—very confident and a wonderful actor. Go buy the flick from Amazon.com or rent it, and watch it more than once. It will grow on you. You'll enjoy the journey. I certainly did! So, Matthew Goode, wherever you are, take a tip from this fan, and see the good that you did in this film. The fight scene quickly brought to my mind, James Bond someday! I learned more about you in Leap Year than I did in A Single Man. How you received notoriety in that film is beyond me. You were hardly in the film except for a couple of nude scenes and a few flashbacks; oh, yes, then there was that famous kiss. Ahh, there you have it! Nudity and kissing Colin Firth! How naive of me!",Leap Year

Mathew Goode's Irish accent is an abomination.And for some reason, the locations are so weirdly out of whack, that while this young lady is claiming to be stuck in Dingle, the reality, according to where it's shot is that she is within walking distance!!!! Let alone the fact that her fiancé's hotel is the Irsh museum of Modern Art! hahahahahahhaha seriously!!! And...wait for it, at the end (no spoiler,don't worry), she leaves his bar in Dingle, and walks to a cliff face...... a cliff face which happens to be about 250km away....ON AN ISLAND!!!!

But if you are an old voyager, you ought to believe in luck. Events in the movie are well connected, so it maintains interest of viewers.

For these reasons, it is by no means a cinematic master-piece or an Oscar-worthy movie.

We are far too bright to allow this piece of crap get a decent rating.We do have communications in Ireland and cars that were manufactured beyond 1960. We do however have a way of coupling up that seems to be advanced in today's world. We don't doublebook dates and take it as it comes. This film at least recognises that.

The story wasn't well built, shallow, not convincing how the personages changed by the events, how they become in love and the reason why the girl dumbed her fiancé.I didn't feel that experience could change her and that Matthew Goode's words could have that big effect on her.

254,Wheely_98gnac,So bad it's almost racist,1,26 April 2011,"This is one of the most shockingly bad movies I've ever seen. I love Amy Adams more than the women in my own family and really thought that I could watch her in just about anything-Junebug, Enchanted, Charlie Wilson's War-she really does bring some sparkle into whatever she gets her teeth into. Here however, she can, at best, be described as a flower growing on a dung-heap.There is no plot-what plot there is is pure run-of-the-mill tripe. The image it portrays of Ireland is actually kind of racist. Yes I'm Irish, but an ardent nationalist I am not. But the characters in this movie are a mix between what Americans thought Irish people were 100 years ago (save the anti-British republicanism) and what the stupider Irish ""heros"" were in bad Irish folklore, a la Darby of Gill. A hairdryer, a contraption so modern and so powerful that the Irish electrical grid cannot handle it, manages to cause a black-out in the town of Dingle, which seems to only consist of one pub/hotel and four cottages. It takes the protagonists days to drive from Kerry to Dublin, a feat which takes about 4 hours. 5 max. The men are superstitious fools, obsessed with black cats and omens attached to different days of the week, while others are thieves and brigands. Matthew Goode's accent is possibly the worst attempt at an Irish accent since Julia Roberts in Mary Reilly. Strike that. It's definitely worse. Oh, also there is no public transport in Ireland so to speak.The little pickles that they get into along the way are idiotic. The dialogue is cringe-worthy. And I love a good chick-flick. As long as its good. Give me Notting Hill any day of the week.Amy Adams, shame on you, please don't let me down again. The only way this film could be described as being in any way good is if it was so bad it was good. But I think it gets there and then it becomes a case of its so bad its good, for a minute but then it gets so bad that its just plain bad. Avoid, unless planning to play some form a drinking game with it whereby a drink is taken every time some inaccurate stereotype associated with Irishness is propounded.Wait. Did I just propound an inaccurate stereotype associated with Irishness by suggesting you use the movie as the basis for a drinking game? Well, maybe they're not that inaccurate........",Leap Year

Our Dekko was cool-headed, kind, patient, and forgiving. He seemed to take her for who she is, and find things to like about her. He rolled with the punches too. My favorite scene was when they were cooking. They cooked together. He wasn't telling her how to do things, he wasn't expecting her to wait on him. They were a team. Pretty much that's how they got to Dublin. On the way they found out about each others values and deepest hurts. Both showed compassion for each other.

Some of the incidents were frankly ridiculous, such as crashing a wedding on a Sunday morning? The geography of Ireland was clearly never researched either, but Ireland is beautiful enough anyway for it not to matter. My only real beef with it, is that they got an English guy to play the main Irish character?!In a film which is set in Ireland... Matthew Goode played the part well, but it was the weirdest amalgam of Irish accents I ever heard- and I am English, so I can't imagine what Irish viewers thought!

268,gabriellebsudik,Unrealistic rubbish,2,4 April 2017,"""Leap Year"" Spoiler Alert! As most movie-goers know, in 99% of romantic comedies, the two main characters end up together at the end. So what separates good romantic comedies from mediocre ones from downright bad ones is what fills the movie until the final moments. In the best romantic comedies, viewers grow to like the main characters and root for them to be together. Viewers understand why the characters like each other. The entanglements that (temporarily) prevent them from being together are fairly believable, as are plot twists. In the best movies, viewers also grow to care about the secondary characters, who often have plots, character development and romantic interests of their own, and who also serve to help the leads towards their goals. And of course, the best romantic comedies are actually, you know... romantic and comedic.Leap Year is missing every element of a good -- or even a mediocre -- romantic comedy. Both main characters, Anna and Declan, are unlikable. Anna because she is selfish, demanding, stuck-up and narrow-minded. Declan because he's just a major crab-ass with a chip on his shoulder, hurling little but hate at someone who needs his help. The vast majority of their dialog consists of the two of them tossing insults and commands at each other, but not in a classic humorous banter kind of way. Just mean. They are not likable for the viewer, and I don't buy that they were likable to each other.The plot twists are beyond stupid. Viewers are expected to believe that it takes a rich American woman several days to cross Ireland. Ireland is a first-world country smaller than the state of Ohio, complete with boats, trains, planes, automobiles, taxis and buses, so of course the whole premise is beyond silly. And of course the goal that supposedly drives this whole plot -- Anna must propose to her boyfriend Jeremy on February 29 -- is flimsy and trite, especially for a self-sufficient woman from 21st Century America.Speaking of boyfriends, there is really only one secondary character worth noting -- the boyfriend Jeremy -- and he is barely in the film. To the extent that he is an impediment to the female lead falling in love with Declan, it's more just presented as fact, and not shown. Nor is it shown why Anna wants him so badly, or why they got together in the first place, etc. Finally, the film tries to convince us that, even after he proposed to Anna, Jeremy never really loved her. And yet... the film fails to convince. If anything, Jeremy's ""flaws"" are that he is practical and cautious. There is no hint that he does not love Anna. When Anna dumps him (off-screen) so she can return to Ireland and pursue Declan, this botched plot point only makes it seem like Anna didn't get what she really wanted -- a dream life in America -- and so she settles for some scrub in Ireland instead.Every other secondary character in the film is completely inconsequential, including Anna's father, played by John Lithgow, who we see for approximately 45 seconds and who serves no purpose other than to set up the importance of February 29th. No one makes us laugh. No one makes us care. No one contributes to Anna and Declan falling in love, expect through the most contrived ways (like some people at an inn who insist they kiss each other at the dinner table). There is certainly no character development among anyone besides the two leads (and even their character development is stunted, at best.)Perhaps worst of all, the film is neither romantic nor funny. Although the two leads are quite handsome, they don't match. There is no chemistry. There is no friendship or cooperation. The most -- nay, the only -- romantic moment in the whole movie came when Anna and Declan accidentally crashed a wedding, and the bride gave a speech to her groom that was short and sweet and wonderful... and completely unrelated to anything else in the film.And speaking of accidentally crashing a wedding... the film was completely unfunny. Attempts at humor consisted of ""witty banter"" that was neither witty nor funny nor flirtatious, just mean. It consisted of Anna stepping in cow poop, then complaining about her $600 shoes. It consisted of a car rolling into a lake. Of Anna being too snotty to ride in said car, because it was small. Of Anna blowing the electricity in an entire Irish town because she is stupid. Of Declan... oh hell, at least the script tried to make Anna's actions funny, even if it failed. The script didn't even try to make Declan funny at all, so I have no examples of the Declan-driven humor. He was non-stop sourpuss.Oh, and that wedding scene reminds me... Much of this movie takes place outdoors. Including the wedding mentioned above, with the bride and guests in bare arms, and no one in coats or hats. This movie takes place in February. Ireland is in the north and it is cold. Especially in February. But you wouldn't know it from the clothes or behavior of the characters. Other reviewers have pointed out similar lack of care regarding the geography of Ireland, the current state of technology of Ireland, and the stereotypical treatment -- bordering on racist insult -- of the Irish people.To sum it all up: This movie is a nearly complete failure all around. No romance, no comedy. No one to care about. No one to root for. Nothing and no one helping us make it through to the end. Two stars for good production values, sets, scenery and sound. Zero stars for everything else.",Leap Year

I challenge anyone to get through the whole film without either falling asleep or turning it off. Best of luck to all!JS",Leap Year

Some skin, not much, there again why when the plot idea is a good one. Liked her as Amelia Earhart in one of the Smithsonian episodes. It was well enough done(I have been to Dingle, etc) to keep us watching.",Leap Year
271,kateozxx,Love is just a word until you find someone who gives it the definition,10,29 March 2018,"This is one of if not the finest modern romantic movie, given the remarkable traditional Irish hospitality, glorious pictures, fascinating music and heart touching performance. It reveals the dark side of the human nature, greediness and selfishness, as well as the bright side, that is the beauty of true love. Everything has beauty, but not everyone sees it. Especially Richard Corliss from the Time magazine. Things that matter most must never be at the mercy of things that matter least.",Leap Year
272,merap,Wonderful Sweet Movie,8,18 September 2019,"Don't know what all the negative reviews are about! Sure you have to take a ""leap"" of faith, and be willing to go with a good dose of artistic license, but the chemistry between Goode and Adams great, the scenery is beautiful, and there's a happy ending. What more do you want in a romantic comedy?",Leap Year
273,alia_6,It resembles the essences of classic films.,10,16 August 2019,"Key ingredient to the divine classic films is simplicity. And that's for sure is obvious in ""Leap Year""; it's a simple film with an honest story that is honestly performed and delivered a lovely feeling to the spectator. There was no moment of boredom nor a moment of extravagance. I dare say that it is a one of the greatest Rom-Coms that is not well appreciated.",Leap Year
274,f_hanlew,Don't be so hard on the movie Matthew!,10,10 October 2018,"A simple story about complex people. While it zips past some character development, Declan steals your heart and the couple has amazing chemistry without being overly ""soppy"". The journey starts off as comedic and ends with you rooting for and feeling for this unlikely couple who seem completely authentic and believeable, despite the fleeting nature of the ""courtship"". Will be one of my all time favorites.",Leap Year

If you believe in the power of romance it may even make tears well up in your eyes. Not meant to change the world just meant to be a fun film. Louis, as in Louis Vuitton the suitcase, is one of the best characters right to the end of the film!",Leap Year
