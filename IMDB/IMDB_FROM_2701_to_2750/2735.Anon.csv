0,Leofwine_draca,A film with little to say,4,23 January 2020,"ANON is yet another Hollywood thriller that's cutting edge when it comes to modern technology, this time concerning surveillance and its implications in the 21st century world. Thus it shines a light on modern practices which are undoubtedly worrying to some. Unfortunately that's about all it has to say, as there's virtually zero storyline apart from a mild little murder mystery whose solution turns out to be mundane, to say the least. Clive Owen seems to be too old for the lead role - the years haven't been kind to him - although Amanda Seyfried fares better as the femme fatale. However, the plot and scripting are far too generic to be of any real depth or interest.",Anon
1,SnoopyStyle,sci-fi,7,3 January 2019,It's a world where everybody's POV is being recorded and accessed through a vast database called The Ether. Solving crimes has become easy for police investigator Sal Frieland (Clive Owen) until a series of killings where all the recordings have been hacked and corrupted. Charles Gattis (Colm Feore) is his supervisor. Suspicion falls on a mysterious woman (Amanda Seyfried) who is able to erase her image from the database.This is pure old fashion sci-fi. It's been stripped down. There are no car chases. Even the sets are unadorned which makes sense when one's vision can be altered anyways. This is reminiscent of reading an old sci-fi story. It's a fascinating world but only for true sci-fi fans. It's a black and white movie in a world of color. The thrills are drained from it but one can see it. There is one section where Sal's vision is being constantly corrupted which could have been a great CGI action sequence. Although I wouldn't likely to accept it since the audience knows it to be a fake. This will divide the audience between those who like old sci-fi stories from those who like action sci-fi.,Anon
2,Prismark10,We know who you are,6,11 May 2018,"Anon is a futuristic sci-fi thriller in the mould of Minority Report.Sal Frieland (Clive Owen) is a cop who solves crimes by reviewing people's memories that exist in the ether. Files are available and reviewed, this is a society where people have lost their privacy.When a series of murders are uncovered, it seems there is an anonymous hacker who is manipulating the point of view of the victims and their memories. Sal figures it is a mysterious woman (Amanda Seyfried) who society has no record of.Writer/director Andrew Niccol creates an interesting world but there is too much reading of small text on screen that scrolls so fast you quickly give up on it. The film loses its impetus once Sal and the woman meet up, the twist was not unexpected as I reckoned their would be an interested third person involved.",Anon
3,nogodnomasters,How long have you not existed?,8,9 August 2018,"The film takes place in a 1984 style ""contemporary future."" The different item is our ability to monitor all of our movements through our own eyes. Law enforcement officials have the ability to hack into our minds and determine innocence or guilt. Sal Frieland (Clive Owen) is one of these such detectives. It isn't long before people start turning up dead, guilty of ""white collar"" crimes. The memory of the dead person has them seeing themselves being shot and a gun barrel. Brains are being hacked and memories are being transplanted and even erased. Sal suspects Anon (Amanda Seyfried) who is off the radar. She doesn't respond to facial recognition and can erase memories. Sal goes undercover to trap Anon, someone who can hack his brain. The theme being we can't trust the accuracy of digital technology because we can make it do what we want. Interesting science fiction film. Wish it had a better lead in.

4,blanche-2,interesting concept,6,6 October 2018,"I watched this with no particular expectation about the story, and I haven't seen ""Black Mirror."" Two of my favorite actors, Clive Owen and Colm Feore star in it - I'm one of those old-fashioned people who follows the actors or director.""Anon"" takes place some time in the future, where no one has any privacy, where everyone's history is instantly available, everyone's memories are recorded and can be viewed.Detective Sal Frieland becomes intrigued as he investigates a series of murders and sees a young woman on the street who has no data. The murders are traced to a message board where people go to contact a hacker who can erase something in their record. Could this woman be killing her clients? He goes undercover to hire her and find out her identity. Amanda Seyfried plays the woman, Anon, and she looks completely different as a brunette. The film is interestingly photographed - in kind of gray tones with lots of strange camera angles. I found it an interesting concept and enjoyed the film.",Anon
5,Uriah43,A Killer's Point of View,5,10 September 2018,"This film takes place in a futurist setting where everybody has an implant that allows them to process and store information in a manner comparable to a computer. Essentially, a device known as ""the mind's eye"" allows a person to record everything they see and once saved in the brain they can then send that file to another person at will. It's an amazing technological leap forward for mankind. But, like everything else, the government has managed to take everything a step further by adapting this technology to solve crime by acquiring the pertinent file from the victim and using that data to resolve the case rather quickly. Unfortunately, this all changes when a female hacker known simply as ""Anon"" (Amanda Seyfried) finds a way to manipulate the data at will and subsequently leaves a trail of murdered victims in her wake. Not only that, but the detective assigned to investigate these murders named ""Sal Frieland"" (Clive Owen) soon discovers that he is just as vulnerable as everyone else. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an imaginative Sci-Fi film which I enjoyed for the most part. However, there were some scenes which seemed a bit too slow for my tastes and I believe the picture could have used a bit more character development as well. But all in all I thought it was an okay movie for a rainy day and I have rated it accordingly. Average.",Anon
6,bombersflyup,Nothing here.,1,21 October 2018,"Anon is lifeless and dull, with a concept but no film.Written and Directed by Andrew Niccol, who did ""Gattaca."" Both share the same tone, but that film's thought-provoking and has heart. We experience no character plot or development, Sal's working to find the killer from the start and we don't see Seyfried's character's point of view or the killer's. I'm surprised it could have such a simple flaw. The information boxes are too small to read and are gone far to quickly to serve any purpose, a big waste of time. The characters are so robotic and it's all way too technical.",Anon
7,Wizard-8,Lethargic pace ultimately sinks this,5,19 May 2018,"While this Netflix exclusive film is far from the worst sci-fi thriller I have ever seen, it is ultimately unsatisfying. I admit that in many ways it's well put together. It looks fairly slick, with solid production values and excellent photography. The acting is low key but effective, giving the characters an edge that does often grab your attention. And the premise of the movie - a world where everybody is connected to what could be considered a cyber Internet - is intriguing, and throws in some interesting ideas.However, as intriguing as the premise gets, there are some flaws in the script. For one thing, it has apparently never occurred to people in this futuristic world to keep using surveillance cameras... probably because if they were used, the story would have ended a lot quicker than it actually does. And while I was glad that the movie doesn't spoon-feed its audience explanations to questions, there were a few muddled moments that made me wish that the movie had more explanation for.Those particular script problems don't sink the movie. What ultimately makes the movie fail is that it's very slow, bland, and meandering. The slow pace prevents any thrills from building, and it's frustrating that it takes more than half of the movie before the protagonist finds himself in trouble... and even when that happens, you don't feel any of the pressure or panic that the protagonist must be going through. It won't take long before you start telling the movie to simply get on with it. But it never does. Not an awful movie, but if you do watch it, wait until you are in a really forgiving and patient mood.",Anon
8,deloudelouvain,Good sci-fi,7,20 July 2018,"For a sci-fi movie I thought Anon was a refreshing movie, with a to me totally new concept, a story that I haven't seen before. And not only I haven't seen it before but it was also good and entertaining, so I really don't get why you would score this movie with a low rating. It had everything you want when watching a sci-fi, nice futuristic concept, a good intriguing story, and a good cast. Clive Owen and Amanda Seyfried, as well as the rest of the cast, made this movie enjoyable to watch. It doesn't have alot of special effects and CGI's but it doesn't really have to, because the story itself stands on it's own and doesn't need any of that. I had a good time and I don't care about the negative reviewers.",Anon
9,siderite,"Watchable, but ultimately forgettable",7,1 January 2020,"The world is a voluntary dystopia sustained by technology and human complacency. Why make the effort of having a private life when everything can be recorded in the cloud? Why bother investigating physical evidence if everything everybody sees is accessible to the police? Why keep memories if you have records? This is the premise of Anon, with the mandatory retro dystopian look to demonstrate stagnation and self delusion, with the tragic silent strong detective and the brilliant and stunning criminal as main characters.It's a movie that feels like Blade Runner had a child with Sea of Love and it was delivered by a smartphone cesarian. The actors did a good job, the design was overwhelmingly more important than the story, which was minimalistic and felt like a prop. However, in the end, it's just a lazy movie that wants to appear discussing important zeitgeist issues, but doesn't make the effort. The dystopia is here, so is the complacency, this movie proves it.",Anon
10,Hellmant,Never quite delivers on it's premise.,7,11 May 2018,"'ANON': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A sci-fi thriller written and directed by Andrew Niccol (of 'GATTACA' fame), and starring Clive Owen and Amanda Seyfried. The story is set in a future world where most crime has been eliminated by eliminating all privacy. A police officer, that enforces these laws, discovers a hacker who has somehow avoided these regulations, and she has now put the entire system in jeopardy. It costars Colm Feore, Sonya Walger, Mark O'Brien, Joe Pingue, Iddo Goldberg, Sebastian Pigott and Rachel Roberts. I found it to be better than Niccol's most previous work, but it's also no 'GATTACA' either.The story is set in a future world where all privacy has been eliminated, and crimes can be solvedsimply by reviewing people's memories. Sal Frieland (Owen) is a police officer who enforces these laws. His whole world is thrown upside down though, when a series of murders go unsolved. Sal also encounters a hacker, called simply 'The Girl' (Seyfried), who seems to have avoided all public surveillance. She also becomes the prime suspect for these murders, because of this of course.The movie has an interesting idea for a sci-fi dystopian thriller, but it never quite delivers on it's premise. Owen is great in the lead, and some scenes make the film worth while. Overall I just felt like the movie is lacking substance, and it's a little too dry and dull as well. It's not that dull though; it mostly kept my attention throughout, which is always an accomplishment.",Anon
11,tabuno,Nice Try,7,1 February 2019,"Clive Owen and Amanda Seyfried star in this hi-tech crime thriller in some not too distant future. Bringing together elements found in the nascent sci fi hi-tech thriller Brainstorm (1983) and the more recent classic mind-bender Inception (2010) or even the superhero Doctor Strange (2016), Anon is the hacker of the futuristic electronic attachments of the human body. Real murders are occurring but what is sometimes seen is not be believed or is erased. The movie script brings a new twist to electronic hacking of the mind and goes some ways to making a decent movie out of it. Yet, the pacing at times is slow, the action not sustained, and the emotional intimacy or moral conundrum not sufficiently intense like Inception where the action continues to build or Brainstorm which is some ways ""knocks your socks off"" as Cliff Robertson's character asks for in that movie. Something really powerful and even more exciting could have come from the movie's premise than offered. Nice try, but Anon doesn't quite breakthrough its possible potential.",Anon
12,southdavid,Skyfall.,4,14 May 2018,"Heavily advertised on Sky in the UK for what seems like months, their second prominent distributed release of the year appeared to be a step up from ""Hurricane Heist"", but appearances can be deceptive and ""Anon"" is a terrible waste talent, money and most significantly, your time. Set in a near or possibly parallel future. Everyone is wired into The Ether, a central system, direct via their eyeballs. This allows for augmented reality, memory replaying and most importantly for the story - the uploading of everyone's view at all times, that can be accessed to (amongst other things) solve crimes. Sal (Clive Owen) is one such detective who does so, along with drinking, mourning his late child and drunk dialling his ex-wife (avoiding cliché is not in ""Anon's"" wheelhouse). A series of murders are committed, where people eyes are ""hacked"" and all they can see is the viewpoint of the killer as they approach. If that sounds like a poor knock off of a ""Black Mirror"" idea that too is how it feels. Though the effects are usually pretty good and personally, I really liked the concreate and glass aesthetic of unnamed city that the story takes place in, it all feels very familiar - like something that we've seen before. ""Anon"" though has two much worse failings than the well-worn set up. The performances are strikingly terrible. I was constantly thinking ""that's the take they went with"" as I sat through another scene of Clive Owen pausing for ages, then phoning in another line. It's like he was acting against a Green Screen and then badly pasted into the scene sometime later. Amanda Seyfried isn't much better, as if they realised that this was essentially a TV movie and gave it the effort that it deserved. Similarly awful is the script, occasionally forcing our leads to prattle on about the values of privacy. It should have been prescient, with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica not long out of the headlines, but instead it's a dull mishmash of sentiments and thoughts, far worse than any that ""The Matrix Revelations"" unloaded on us. And, without giving anything away, the ending is painfully obvious.Andrew Niccol has covered all the ideas of this film before, in better films. Save yourself and watch one of those instead.",Anon
13,imseeg,"Good acting, seductive suspenseful mood, BUT incomprehensible storyline and way too much silly and anoying visual effects.",5,27 June 2019,"Interesting story. Good actors, who act well indeed. The director is able to create an contineous suspenseful and seductive dark mood. So far so good, BUT this story is told in such an incomprehensible way that it really gets tiring after watching it for an hour. Too much complicated flashbacks and flashforwards.What's even more ANNOYING is the constant use of text messages on the screen. This is suppose to look futuristic, but it begins to seriously drag down the focus of this story. All this fidgety visual text effects projected onto the movie screen are heavily distracting and also often incomprehensible...Could have been a good movie, because the talents and money was available, but I highy recommend to AVOID this movie for above mentioned reasons.",Anon

In a world without anonymity or crime, a detective ( Clive Owen) meets a woman(Amanda Seyfried) She has no identity, no history and is invisible to the cops. Sal realizes this may not be the end of crime, but the beginning.Owens and Seyfried are excellent in this sci-fi indie noir .

15,alindsay-al,A truly terrible attempt at a thriller,1,16 May 2018,"This film has been promoted heavily on sky so I decide to give it a go and wow Anon is one of the most dull and boring films I have ever seen. The premise of the film sees a detective on the hunt for a murderer who is manipulating technology. Clive Owen plays the lead character in this film and I'm going to be truly honest I think he is one of the most overrated actors around, I just find him so dull and lacking any charm which fits with this film perfectly. There are times where he does an okay job but his character is so boring and lifeless that you have to wonder what is important about his character. Amanda seyfried is in this film and she just doesn't get anything to work with and it makes her character feel very cliché and adds nothing to the film. There are a bunch of supporting characters who are just nothing for the film and just add absolutely nothing to the film. The story is very bland as it becomes a mystery that just isn't particularly interesting, plus there is a story arc for owens character that feels completely unnecessary and is never completed. Also there is a twist towards the end of the film and it feels like a complete cheap decision and one that really hurts the film. The script is completely lackluster and it doesn't add anything in the film, plus this is a completely serious film and it provides absolutely no moments of humour. The style of the film is what everybody will be talking about, and I swear if you have ever played the video game watch dogs you have seen this style before, I didn't like it then and I don't like it now. Plus similar to Transformers: The Last Knight this film has a huge issue changing between aspect ratios as the film goes on and it is incredibly jarring to watch. Also this films pacing is terrible making it feel ten times longer then this film actually is. Overall this is a terrible film and should not be seen for any reason.",Anon
16,iquine,Well-Shot and Solid Creative Concept,8,19 May 2020,"(Flash Review)This was a similar concept to other films yet it had a different twist and mixed it with bold and geometric cinematography! The basis is the authorities can access your recorded memories, as society is all tied together, to retrace what happened in a crime scene or murder for example. Of course someone has found a complex way around this. A clever woman named Anon, who lives off the grid or untraceable, who can be hired to re-render and scrub out sensitive parts of your life from your recorded memory. Yet, Anon also has a bone to pick after seeing some of these memories and she knows how not to get caught. Until she meets our protagonist who works for the authorities and goes undercover to investigate a series of crimes. There's the basis for some neat Sci-Fi concepts in a detective story line. This also goes into what is a pure memory vs a recorded memory.",Anon

18,jimbo-53-186511,"Parts of other films are evident in the narrative, but overall Anon is fairly enjoyable",6,2 July 2021,"When 1st class detective Sal Frieland begins to learn of a series of crimes linked to an individual whom isn't registered on their rather 'invasive' database', he sets about trying to identify this mysterious assassin, but this may prove to be dangerous when the clued up assassin is able to clean up without detection leading Frieland and his colleagues on a wild goose chase...Anon sets its stall out quite early by showing Clive Owen wandering around with loads of random nonsense appearing on the screen in front of him on a heads up display (reminiscent of the Terminator franchise). Most of it is unimportant nonsense which is show-offy, but I did hope that the film would settle down after this slight faux pas...hmmm... it did tbf, but still had some rough spots.The investigative side of things actually isn't too bad and I did like the cat-and-mouse antic style narrative employed here which was arguably one of the film's biggest selling points. This is the most intriguing part of the film and was one of the biggest drivers in making the film as enjoyable as it was.Clive Owen gives a textbook performance here; he's done the same sort of thing in a villainous role and here he does the same turn, but in a more sauve sympathetic turn. Amanda Seyfrield is a good foil for Owen and does her part in bringing the film to life. Colm Feore is also good in support.There's a twist at the end involving who was behind it all (it was obvious that the police were behind it, but I guessed the wrong person :-(. Having said that I still quite enjoyed the film, but there were slow overly-chatty spots in the middle where my interest waned slightly, but that's just me. I still think many a viewer will enjoy this film, just don't expect much in the way of originality.",Anon
19,masonfisk,NOT ANON ENOUGH...!,3,9 September 2018,"A disappointing misfire from the usually reliable Andrew Niccol. This Netflix original details a world where humans have implants whereby they can see digital projections in the actual world around them in the form of advertising & in this story, details of crimes that only the police can see and/or access. When a woman's identity goes unregistered by this tech, our protag played Clive Owen, goes on the search for who this woman is & why all traces of her presence continues to vanish from people's memories like chalk from a cleaned slate. The femme fatale of sorts, played by Amanda Seyfried (who was in Niccol's In Time w/Justin Timberlake), is a ravaging vamp but the story in itself gives her nothing to work with. That seems to be the problem of this whole affair where the digital projections feel unfinished (still in their beta stage) & the thrust of the story has an unresolved sheen to it.",Anon
20,AudioFileZ,Empty & Depressing,5,11 June 2018,"Imagine a super computer. No not like that, but the theoretical one computer powerful enough that it connects everything. Oh, this includes each person as everyone is in the database and everyone is like a node with video of everything we experience. The computer can show anyone anything including the names of any passersby or even the content of a street vendor's knackwurst, Some have higher access as is common in analytics of course, but something strange is happening as those policing things are started to experience hacks in their files. This means simply some people won't show up and some people's files won't show what happened at a crucial moment in the commission of a murder. Is the AI pushing back or just a craftier computer hacker that is also an elevated criminal? Sounds promising, however get ready for a droll and dark ride. I said droll because it's tension building without much color or real emotion. The movie feels just as artificial as the files that fool the police, or whatever division of cyber law enforcement this is suppose to be. Why I kept watching was not exactly rewarding in the end. I felt as depressed as the sepia toned gray cinematography. Anon made me yearn for a more involving whodunit with some emotional color. If the ultimate connected society is as depressing as this flic then I even see our car's ECU's as sucking the life out of driving.

22,Troy_Campbell,"Cold and detached, but great ideas.",4,13 May 2018,"Slowly but surely carving out their own niche in the world of movies, this Netflix premiere is another mid-budget sci-fi with, for better and mostly for worse, an auteur at the helm given full artistic control. Kiwi writer-director Andrew Niccol is no newcomer to the sci-fi genre, his first foray coming way back in 1997 with Gattaca and subsequently including AI thriller S1m0ne and Justin Timberlake on-the-run flick In Time. There's no doubting Niccol's brilliance in creating juicy high-concept ideas; here we have a world with no anonymity thanks to human eyes acting as both live-stream cameras and instant digital databases. But the criticisms levelled at him throughout his directorial career remain, in particular the cold and detached tone he cultivates and his workmanlike approach to action. One can't help but wonder if more studio production control might've steered this into more energetic territory. There are interesting moments littered throughout, especially once the police force, accustomed to solving crime exceptionally quick and easily, come up against a hacker who alters what they see (and therefore believe), yet the thin character development makes it hard to really care. Clive Owen sleepwalks his way through as a dishevelled investigator with the same backstory as all dishevelled investigators-dead family member, his fault, looks for solace in the bottom of a glass-whilst Amanda Seyfried fails to convince as a hacker femme fatale. The action sequences are serviceable without being exhilarating; the notion of being unable to trust what you see generates some tension, but the stiff choreography and by-the-numbers progression of action hampers its potential to truly thrill. Not bad for a rainy Saturday afternoon, but a lack of heart and exuberance stop Anon from connecting either as an engrossing sci-fi yarn or an exciting action flick.",Anon

The issue it tried to address - the loss of anonymity is timely and important, given the constant security breaches we are all experiencing.

26,carbuff,Decent Sci-Fi with some basic philosophical/political points--insignificant spoilers,8,28 October 2018,"Overall, I'm not a huge fan of Netflix productions, but this is one I liked. The plot moves at a somewhat languid pace, but that seems appropriate for the type of modern society it depicts. If you're paying attention to what's currently going on in China with the citizenship ""FICO"" system they're developing, the approximate future society depicted in this film is definitely a possibility. When lead characters talk about how anonymity conflicts with larger interests, it's an obvious dig at Google, Amazon, etc. (of course, we really should include Netflix here also). ""Anon"" doesn't have a really hard punch to it, but my interest never flagged, and I was never tempted to fast forward or anything like that. There is a bit of sex and nudity, if parents are interested, and the sporadic violence is quite tame by today's standards. It basically succeeds in making the philosophical/political point that we should not be so quick to surrender our personal privacy for a few bucks and probably not even for perfect law and order. Of course, there is the requisite Sci-Fi hand-waving behind the basic super-high tech depicted in this film, but a reasonably close approximation of this hyper-surveillance society is certainly within the real of the possible.

27,joebloggscity,ANON will find itself anonymous quite soon,5,12 May 2018,"So this is probably my first time watching a film that is simultaneously availably on Satellite/Cable TV as well as cinema, but I'll leave out the merits or otherwise of this strategy. At least it will give some movies greater weight than if they were simply shoved straight to Cable TV (the new straight to video market).We have actually a science fiction tale, as Clive Owen is a policemen in a near future world in which there is a kind-of uber-Google glass system in place for information, identification & tracking. Murders occur and Clive Owen is on the case of a lady who is someone who can erase events in the Google Glass system.Clive Owen gives it weight, but really this film despite an interesting arc, is surprisingly boring. The settings etc are all wonderful, but I can't muster the interest to go into any further detail. You struggle to empathise with any of the characters and then there is the nauseating product placement at the start of the film which is like a baseball in the face. All that diminishes the film.If you can catch this on free to air sometime, it can be passable, but personally I'd say give it a miss. Some positives, but overall too dull to bother with.",Anon

Imagine as you walk down the street and as you pass people their name and everything about them instantly pops up and how this could be hacked. A police force which depends on playing back what is seen by the victims of crimes to instantly see who committed the crime, yes the end to crime, until it can be hacked and false recordings either replacing or omitting people or events being installed instead. Never trust what you can see or what hackers want you to see. Interesting story but unfortunately slow in places and no explanation as to why the hacker did the hacking? Rating 6 out of 10",Anon
29,kjproulx,"A Unique Premise, But Nothing More",5,11 May 2018,"There's always that one premise that comes along and impresses you to no end, but the execution may not live up to the promises that the film set up throughout the first act. Anon is one of Netflix's latest feature films to be released on their platform, but I truly believe this could've benefitted from a theatrical release and a little tuning within its script. Sadly, this is a premise that not enough audience members can probably latch onto and with not a very good execution, the marketing would've failed as well. I honestly had no expectations in terms of how I would enjoy this film, but I came out of it feeling both impressed and underwhelmed. Here's why you should check out Anon if you're a fan of fantasy or crime, but also why you might not want to, due to its overall execution.Imagine that you have video surveillance and the most advanced computer system that the world has to offer, all built into your mind and eyes. That's pretty much what this movie asks of you during its first few minutes. If that alone intrigues you, then I think you may share the same experience that I did. Following a team of detectives that rifle through first-person footage of numerous murders, almost like they are investigating in the style of playing the same level of a video game over and over again, this makes for a very interesting investigation throughout the movie and is definitely the right story to fit the world that has been built around it, but when your ending is just as ordinary as any other mediocre crime film, then what need should anyone have to watch it?I've always been a fan of Clive Owen and his performance here does seem to be inspired, but his character isn't given enough to do. I was caring about his backstory, due to flashbacks that are implanted in his mind that he replays throughout the course of the movie, but the backstory is really all his character is given to do. Amanda Seyfried plays the accused killer here and her story plays very well off Owen's. Personally, when these two would enter each other's minds, I found myself riveted by every second that would pass by. Sadly, I found the rest of the movie to be pale in comparison.The Fantasy/Sci-Fi genre has always interested me, so when a new, unique idea presents itself in the form of a feature film, I always jump on the chance to watch it. That being said, this is a film that leaves a lot to be desired in terms of surprises or an eventful climax. You sort of see where the movie is going by the time the film reaches act two and you realize who's good and who's bad. It's really more about exploring this world, but the idea that technology is built into us is about as far as they take it, not really exploring anything in detail, which felt slightly lazy. I never like a movie that starts out with a great premise and then fizzles out because they have nothing more to offer.In the end, Anon is a movie for fans of the Fantasy/Sci-Fi drama only, because those of you who like a good who-done-it should look elsewhere. You know who it's not and by the time the killer is revealed, it's like, really? I found myself scratching my head at how easily everything was resolved by the end and I have no desire to ever revisit this film again. So yes, the world itself is very unique and I would recommend checking it out for those who are impressed by that kind of thing, but the story is too basic and the end result seems like a cop-out. A unique and impressive world, held together by a very thin plot, with heavy dialogue as its coverup.",Anon
30,kuarinofu,Deeply immersive yet weak storyline,6,9 July 2018,"Wow, this movie was surely something I will not forget any time soon.
It's one of those movies that sucks you into its flow. The visuals are great, the score covers everything else. Nice pacing, the movie isn't too long and never really gets boring. A couple of details here and there, a couple of hints, expressions, I love this stuff.
It also mixes its own ideas with some of the existing ones, like Watch Dogs and Deus Ex franchises and that Black Mirror episode (The Entire History of You). 
The privacy message was straightforward and never really felt that groundbreaking or fresh. The timing, however, is perfect (taking into account recent privacy scandals).
The plot was the weakest part, it was very basic and sometimes shallow, not really providing for interesting dialogue and situations. But still it was executed the best way possible.
It is far away from being perfect, yet very immersive and is full of potential. I'd LOVE to see a series based around the ideas.",Anon

I was actually a fan of the nonsense story and the Big Brother, data footprint overlay that felt very videogamey, I really enjoyed the first person scenes and I thought the transitions from 1:85 to 16:9 was very effective. It's a really well conceived, well paced, moody, well edited sci-fi with great locations and a really sedate, hypnotic tone.
I was well prepared to enjoy it as a good piece of trash, filling the void of Watch Dogs style videogamey type adaptations with an over abundance of gratuitous sex and nudity and detective tropes. But right around the point where Owen's character starts to get hacked himself, the film lost me, might have been the bad pacing, strange goings on, start of the terrible acting, or the confusing plot, or the lack of cohesion in the emerging plot-holes.

34,pkpera,"Delete f* everything, especially the f*",2,5 May 2018,"As in many other cases, I could not resist to put quote from movie as resume of my review. Here, it needed some beeping, though. That was talk what made me laugh pretty much, and almost only part of the movie what was at least fun.I liked previous movies of Andrew Niccol, all what I watched. This is just light years below them. Too much using of F-word, here it was unnecessary in 80% cases. Sign of bad dialogue and that writer wanted some suspense in cheap, lazy way.
Cliwe Oven is good actor, but his age was well visible here, maybe too much. The movie dragged too, as some 80 years old. There was drug scene, little longer, too much smoking - nothing of it added to story. I again think with my paranoid mind that author(s) don't avoid those 'stimulations' . 
This movie is just some pretendous, weak, pseudo intellectual try to display some possible bad near future, where people may be under total watch, observation, by transmitting and recording their view. Is idea to start it right with some murders best one ? They made some forced detective cat-mouse play, what was executed on top of it poorly. Why were POV shots with gun in hand pointed to victims head so slow and unrealistic ? I can say only, again: pseudo tension. Good way to drag it some time, and reach 100 minutes of movie time. There were some unnecessarily repeated scenes. I can understand why editors repeated 3x part with Amanda Seyfried naked, again nothing with story. And funny thing, she was not naked on top in sex scene, where should be. I guess that was not her day for it :-) Don't get me wrong, I like her as actress and persona. Actually, she was great in all this mess, by just being natural, I think.
All in all, idea was good, not great. The writing, execution, direction - pretty poor. I would call it lazy writing, directing. Or maybe just incapable (anymore).
Would be nice if authors would wake up, and yell: delete f* everything ! Let's start all this again, now with much more spirit and effort.
Final words: and I'm now in dilemma: to watch at all anything of Netflix branded new Sci-Fi movies (all so far I watched was miserable), or to watch again new Lost in Space serial by them. It started poorly, but went better. And actually is rare case when remake is much better than original, or movie from 1998.

35,kaptenvideo-89875,"Deep and meaningful scifi about the dangers of modern technology. For you not to fall asleep, it's also a story about chasing a murderer.",7,4 June 2018,"The screenwriter-director Andrew Niccol's newest attempt to create a ""thinking person's"" sci-fi movie. This is what he once got known for, people still remember his debut in the form of 1997's ""Gattaca"".""Anon"" is a solid, somewhat innovative techno thriller which has been underappreciated by critics so far, although not deservedly so.The story is simple: police detective (Clive Owen) is trying to solve a series of crimes which lead to mysterious female hacker (Amanda Seyfried).As usual with ""hacker movies"", she is rather cool and sexy, not like, you know, the real computer geniuses. So far, so traditional. What makes the movie special, however, is how it's been put together exactly.You see, Niccol has found a way to effectively mix old and modern. Visually, it has the cool, sleek, minimalist style of pre-blockbuster-age sci-fi cinema when it was a mostly intellectual genre not interested to offer just cheap thrills.On the other hand, it manages to look futuristic - or at least forward-looking - depicting the way that everybody lives on and through the digital screen.This creates a memorable, somewhat creepy atmosphere of physical and emotional emptiness filled with (moving) pictures seemlessly integrated into life - these come in holographic form, so just appear and disappear when asked.This is exaggerated version of the digital-filled lives many of us have decided to participate in this day and age, and yet it's pretty realistic. Everything applies to our current everyday life, too.For example, the phenomenon of people compulsively pictures and videos of stuff that has happened before or to somebody else, instead of trying to go and have a life for themselves.Niccol has used a lot of first-person content - seen through the viewer's eyes - which make the result feel even more modern. There's a lot of FP-based videogames which feel similar to movies, now we have an actual movie which makes great use of the same perspective.Based on what's written so far, it's understandable how Niccol decided to create an experience based more on the mood (atmosphere) than story and characters.The problem with the movies betting big on mood, especially if they are slow and somber such as ""Anon"", is that people are finicky creatures and their moods tend to change way faster than a movie lasts. Yet it's usually supposed that we watch movies during one sitting.So when the initial ""charge"" of the mood wears off - and it most probably will before the end - the movie still needs properly fleshed-out characters and world to carry it through.This is something that ""Anon"" lacks by its very design, so at some point it gets easier to like it more intellectual level than form a deep connection with whatever's happening onscreen. Just like I felt watching ""Blade Runner 2049"", for example.It's not a flaw per se, the result is still good and doesn't feel stretched too far or long. ""Anon"" is a compact, carefully constructed work and one of the better examples of how to create an effective techno thriller. But I wouldn't expect many to really love it.The story would probably feel more fulfilling on emotional level, if it had more discussions or thoughts about the weird dichotomy of modern digital life where spying on people and gathering their data is the new normal, and the wish to be left alone can bring suspicions that you must have something horrible to hide.There's a brief dialogue about that in the end, and it comes across as surprisingly deep and thoughtful. Having more of that would turn ""Anon"" even more into thought-provoking antidote to Spielberg's recent ""Ready Player One"" which takes places mostly in digital worlds.Niccol's previous project, 2014's ""Good Kill"" starring Ethan Hawke, is a techno thriller of sorts also. Thanks to more fleshed out story and main character, offering more emotional connection, I would recommend it over ""Anon"".But both are worth watching, if you are interested about somber dramas about the dangers of modern technology.By the way, the beautiful and mysterious Seyfried doesn't have as big role in ""Anon"" as the promoting materials make you think.Her character is important but the movie shows a whole lot more of Clive Owen (or some other guys) watching videos appearing in thin air. Just so you know.",Anon
36,srdjan_veljkovic,"Interesting premise, bad implementation",4,26 August 2018,"It's not just that it lacks fundamental explanation - like, how does the ""I see what you see"" work, is there some implant? Of course, if there's an implant, then one could just remove it. If there's no implant, then there's some kind of brainwave manipulation, which is of course a problem as most people have brainwaves at similar frequencies, so, if you manipulate one, you manipulate many in the same vicinity.But, even if you disregard those fundamentals, the story is not compelling and there's not much point. The girl ""hides because she can"". Well, that's nice, but, as she said, it's a lot of work, nobody does that much work just because they can.One could go on to dismantle the story, but, the thing is, everything else is not all that good either. Acting is bland and uninteresting. Special effects are not very good, are uninspired and repetitive. Sure, some of it was on purpose, but, not much. There's no real fun here (and there could have been with this premise), but there's also not much dread or excitement, and there is only one really nice use of this premise.That one use is the scene when our protagonist as an undercover detective goes into his fake job as a stock broker. It's a an office with a bunch of people just sitting there. They are working, but you can't see it, as they work ""through their eyes"". There's no computer that they type on, or monitor they look at. So, it's surreal. They are just sitting there, yet they are working. It's a powerful metaphor for the intellectual work, stock-broking included, where there need not be any physical labor, not even typing on a keyboard.That scene is actually the reason to not give this movie a very low rating.

41,quaseprovisorio,it lacks a bit of pace and a bigger budget...but it unfolds interesting ideas.,6,1 May 2020,"Anon is another attempt of andrew niccol to endorse what he seems to love the most: sci-fi technological ""distopias"" (this one unfortunately can't be exactly called like that). here we pretty much know the life of everyone else, and someone keeps anonimity - that's the bug. plus there's a killer out there invading the eyes and the first person point of other people, in order to kill them but the biggest point is why being anonimous in a world where that's not even a thought. this makes totally sense in a world like today and i did like the way it unfolded.the characters are written in a pretty straightforward way, without much richness and they're not very deep, but we can understand their motivations. the main theme is very interesting and makes us follow the movie - the investigation while not having huge action moments is also well set, and we keep on guessing. it kinda feels like a tale more than a real sci-fi film, that's why somehow this could have been a short film instead of a 90 minutes movie. however i can't complain much becuse i did enjoy it.the best parts are how niccol manages this world to work. how he turns things upside down with the ""anomalities"", how he adds richness to the concept by some actions that the characters do within the eye. the concept was well worked i think, and that can raise a lot of questions regarding our own life.the main problem might be how superficial all seems to be sometimes: some dialogues tha want to be philosophycal, but they're more one liners than anything else. how the past of the characters is a bit too simple and the ending might be predictable soon enough. another issue is that this asks for more scenario richness, but perhaps budget restrictions might be the main reason for that.not gonna lie, i enjoyed it. don't think is a great movie but can't regret tha i watched it. i wanted more depth into the story and the characters, but how it is it's still an enjoyable movie. it's by no means a gatacca, but people can watch it without having regrets. plus it's sci-fi that speaks absolutely about today, and that's important.",Anon

46,ivko,middle of the road fair with strong message,7,7 May 2018,"Anon, a Netflix original movie, stars Clive Owen as a police detective or the future equivalent thereof. The film is set in a world where everyone has every second of their lives recorded to a kind of cloud platform that makes every second of their life available for instant retrieval.It's only visual information, not thoughts, but it includes literally everyone, even infants, and literally every second of each life, even the first breaths. The exact mechanism is never really gone into (or I just missed it), but it's a McGuffin and not really important. The real point of the film is the impact this technology has had on society.Cops like Owen's character don't really specialize in a particular type of crime anymore; their proficiency is basically information retrieval. People come in with questions or to report a crime and the detective simply taps into the recordings of witnesses and suspects at will, pulling what they need to solve the crime or answer the question.Although it's illegal for anyone but the police to access other's footage without permission, a common challenge in this world seems to be ""show me your last X minutes"", with refusal interpreted as guilt. In other words, this is a world without anything like what we would call privacy.People have responded to this lack of privacy by developing techniques for evading detection from law enforcement, bosses, spouses, etc. When someone wishes to hide an aspect of their life, they send out a request to the ""ether"", essentially the dark web, to hire a hacker to bypass security mechanisms and alter their footage. So a cheating husband might turn an evening with a prostitute into a quiet evening alone watching TV, for example.The trouble starts when people are murdered and it's discovered that the killer is hacking peoples eyes and projecting his/her perspective onto the victims eyes so that no recording of the killer exists. Owen's character takes lead and eventually discovers Amanda Seyfried's character, a hacker who is maybe also the murderer.I'll skip the rest of the plot. It's a basic murder mystery with a not-at-all surprising resolution. Which isn't to say it's boring or bad, just that there are plenty of other films with similar plots and ""twists"", so I think it's more interesting to focus on the philosophy, if you will, of the movie.The subject of privacy has been in the news quite a bit lately because of the Facebook hacks. I think what's interesting is that we seem to be starting to care once again about privacy, following a decade of steadily selling our information in exchange for some convenience software from Silicone Valley.The recent breaches have highlighted something that we seem to have forgotten for a while, which is that information about our private thoughts and habits represents tremendous power over us. The information can be used to bypass our safeguards and mental protections, altering our perception of the world around us without our knowledge.In the movie this is literally true; characters who have access to other's private information can control their actual perceptions and use that control to deprive people of life, liberty, and happiness, the rights Western civilization cherishes above all others. It may be a bit heavy-handed, but the point is well made, I think.I also think it's interesting that this privacy-free world is not presented as a pure dystopia. The movie is careful to show how the technology actually improves peoples lives in many ways, such as the relative lack of crime and the ability to retain memories of loved ones that have passed. It would be way too easy to present this future as a Orwellian nightmare, but the real danger of the convenience for information trade is the seductiveness of it. It's easy, after all, to avoid dangers that seem dangerous. It's the ones that seem like a good deal and have subtle, long-term costs that are hardest to avoid.But my favorite line in the movie comes from a discussion about why someone would care so much about privacy. Anyone who has ever had this discussion with others has heard the line ""Why would you care if you have nothing to hide?""Who cares if your ISP is tracking your Internet browsing or searches, unless of course you have something to hide. It's a hard argument to counter, because it implies that any resistance is due to you doing something embarrassing, and that therefore your objections don't have any merit. And it works, because no one wants their friends and neighbors to think they are deviants, which is why companies and governments are so fond of it as a deflection.Anon answers this question quite nicely: ""It's not that I have something to hide, but that I have nothing I want to share.""

Everyone in society has an embedded Mind's Eye that records absolutely everything you see at every moment. It's one form of a future dystopia, Big Brother taken to an ultimate limit. Detective Sol (Clive Owen) and partner Charles (Colm Feore) are trying to track down a serial killer who, somehow, can hack into the Mind's Eye records from each victim and erase the parts that would reveal who it is. It looks like the culprit is a woman (played by Amanda Seyfried and known only as The Girl) who has managed to take herself entirely off this futuristic, pervasive grid and lives as a hacker-for-hire.So far so good, but it all depends on how well it's done. I just give it a so-so 5/10. It's watchable but not gripping. Curiously a lot of scenes have the characters simply staring into cyberspace while they motioinlessly (and emotionlessly) retrieve Mind's Eye records or send messages. This is 'acting'? Nice work if you can get it. The settings including offices, streets, cars, apartments, dress, and all the rest are straight-up present-day stuff with not much attempt to look futuristic.The big theme, such as it is, is the old one of information versus privacy. Who among the controllers should have access to our individual histories, and how much? Withh today's social media networks we already have around us the roots of this information-soaked society. Anon shows it taken to an extreme. Its message, underneath all the busyness with the murder mystery, is that privacy should win (as The Girl says, ""It's not that I have something to hide.

I haven't read all his books or stories but he's not credited so I assume this is an original idea. If so, well done writer/director.But that is also the problem - writer/director. It's a great idea, but poorly developed and executed. The movie drags in many places, particularly the 2nd act. Some reviewers say this adds tension. Really? Let's just drag things out a bit to create some tension. Nope, sorry, it doesn't work. It's poorly paced and draggy.Clive Owen and Amanda Seyfried do a fair job, as do all the players, with what is not quite a sterling script and the acting demands aren't onerous. The direction is good. But slow...The movie has several shortcomings. First, the love interest between Owen and Seyfried just doesn't work. At least not for me. Assuming he's so magnetically attractive - as well he may be! - that Seyfried will fall for his character is one step beyond. And it's not actually essential to the development of the plot.It's supposed to be set in the future, even the near future. It looks just like our time, even a shade earlier!, the only difference is the Black Mirror-ish assumption on which the movie's based. And Owen smokes all over the place. Yeah, a detail but it's never explained. Unless we're in alternative dimension/time-line/history mode. But there's no indication of that, either. It just kicks another thread of reality into touch.Neither is the main conceit of the movie explained but we, the viewers, just roll along with it and that's sort of okay.The movie is all the more disappointing because Andrew Nichols is one of the very, very, very few people who can write and direct a good movie - Gattaca (of which this sort of has shades...) and In Time to name two.He also wrote The Truman Show but that had a different director and I'll warrant that made the difference between the movie being merely good and brilliant!So, disappointing overall.

Dick-ish movies (Blade Runner, Minority Report, Total Recall, The Adjustment Bureau, The Man In The High Castle...), you'll enjoy it (just be prepared for the draggy bits) otheriwse it's not a must-see.",Anon
53,elenaphysics,Welcome to mediocre,4,5 April 2019,"This movie is mediocre. It had suspens BUT it was lost in a huge plot hole.
First of all, why should you trust someone's eyes? They could have cameras everywhere and satellites etc etc and control everything,and then they could add the eye thing as a backup.
Actually you can do anything with eyes closed.
Then this guy watches and watches all over again his late son,but he does not even have a photo of him or a video.
At the beginning he sees an 'unknown' woman and automatically concludes that she is behind the murders and tries to hire her in order to contact her. But other 'unknown' people show up and he rejects them automatically without thinking about the possibility that they are too, involved in this mess.
Before hiring her he is involved in a cross fire with the couple killer and he is injured by a train. Because the killer hacked his mind. And when he meets her for the first time,if she was indeed the killer,she would have shot him on the spot.
The whole police department is based on what he is seeing and they don't even bother to put somewhere a surveillance camera. The whole movie seems old tech.I mean he could end up dead without seeing his killer.
Anw the lady pulls out a gun on him on several occasions. No one bothers to save him and arrest her or kill her.And he risks his life with the person he believes is murderer.
It feels such an odd movie. A combination of minority report (without the high tech ) and Se7en. Yes se7en because there is this detective that everything revolves around him and he goes to places that look haunted.Why would you go there mate? Also the cinematography is a bit dark, it has this annoying yellow undertone everywhere.",Anon

My biggest criticism is there was not enough character building or depth to the lifestyles of the era. Too little information to get the audience interested.
As for the plot, it is an interesting concept but perhaps not as far from current reality as many would think. Yes, it's plausible at least. I'm glad that Clive Owen was chosen for the lead role because he always gives that something special in his performances. The story is good, the computer generated graphics are excellent but the script is a bit weak. I gave this a 7/10 which is perhaps more than it deserves. Hey.. I'm a Clive Owen fan!",Anon

There is no further story development, therefore, many viewers may find it not so interesting (or cool) and become impatient to reach the ending scene instead.That much said, I would like to mention that the main lead actors ( Clive Owen and Afiya) did give fine performances in their respective roles.

58,joker-4,SciFi blast for cliché crime caper,7,30 May 2018,"The future can be scary, and that's exactly how writer/director Andrew Niccol (Gattica) likes it. Niccol's latest, Anon, directly distributed by Netflix, takes social media privacy scares and concerns and makes those issues a substantial threat as every event every single person sees is stored forever in an Orwell-ian cloud. Anon presents an original, albeit disturbing, viewpoint on how deep privacy can be regarded making this future world as scary as it is believable. Digital ads the size of buildings can be seen as an on-board Alexa/Siri/Samantha can direct listeners for every step they take, as someone is always watching you, until they hack you.Clive Owen stars as a detective in a nameless city under a perpetually gray twilight sky who has access to these personal, individual records. He's a gruff, tired-looking cop who smokes (so hey, at least that vice is still around in the near future) as much as he plays voyeur into his, as well others', memories. However, hackers who work off the grid can be paid in order to edit, thus hide, certain memories. One hacker has taken to killing such individuals and Owen is tasked to stop the murderer. Anon, played by Amanda Seyfried, is a hip hi-tech cat that proves her prowess by slowly hacking into Owen's own visuals, distorting what he is seeing, be that a clear intersection that is actually jamming, or an empty elevator car instead of an empty elevator shaft. The tech premise is extraordinary, tempering the best of what science-fiction at its core is supposed to offer, as the presented threat is real and believable.Alas, all good science fiction does have its limits, as does Anon, and this neo-noir thriller exposes its fatal flaws in the programming. Once this world and its technology have been explored to its limits, the crime element of the narrative forgoes all its collective coolness resulting in a typical whodunnit-style mystery that fizzles into a who-cares climax. Owen makes a good cop, but apparently gumshoe clichés, like tobacco and the vintage cars driving throughout, remain woefully relevant. Maybe the true magic lies ahead in allowing rogue editor to hack together a more fitting finale.",Anon

Hacking people. Some really good ideas there. It went a bit too crazy with it at times, but overall it kept it together. It's a great look at a dystopian future. It's not a slick or as fleshed out as Minority Report, nor ultimately as well written, but it's a nice little interesting thriller.Good pacing: it's more of a slow-burn style film. Nice world-building, nice technological milieu that has an understated realistic feel to it. Reminds me in a lot of ways of Gattaca and even Inception.Flawed ending & wasted potential: the killer was doing it for what reason again? Going around killing people for what reason? No reason? That just sucks. What was the point?There are lots of films like this: ones that provide no good reason for why something happens. No need to wrap everything up with a little bow, but at the end of the day, reasons matter. If a killer is seeking revenge, you can connect with that. If someone is trying to cover something up, you need to establish who and why.The worst stories are ones where the villain shows up at the end and there's no clues, no logically satisfying reason why they were doing something. In some films it doesn't necessarily matter, but in a film like this where it's essentially a whodunit/thriller and you're focusing on who and (more importantly) why, it matters a lot.

It's like the Robin Williams film 'Final Cut', only this time it's more of a sci-fi noirs murder mystery using a clever use of elements, setting the tone and shape of the world. For me, it would be a crazy challenge to try to live in Sal's world knowing that nothing is secret and all privacy is gone. I like Amanda Seyfried's character. The motivations of both characters speak louder than words and they have concerns around privacy and the film is done in a clever use of FX, lighting and the use of great locations making this film feel clinically sinister. It only amplifies the oppressive and dystopian mood of the storyline, adding up to giving the film a believable near-future quality and I think it compliments and enhances the story. It also shows how a complex and immersive world can be created using excellent design rather than a green-screen and hours of computer-generated eye-candy.

So the idea is neat, people have brain implants connected to the eyes like a cyborg, and someone hacks it, changing reality to become anonymous. And while this idea is very cool and was interesting for about 45 to 50 minutes, but I feel like this would have made a better short film, because that idea is mostly all they have and its drawn out, the techy tricks only go so far. I like the actors in this one like Seyfied and Owen, and they did a moderately serviceable job in their roles. The first few hacker tricks are neat but it gets old after a while, and I found myself waiting for the ending. I felt the film drags on pulling out the same old trick. But thats just my opinion.So as I said, I like the tricks and special effects involved, but that was truly the only thing I really LIKED. Everything else was average or above average at most. The acting was fine, considering it had some respected actors in it. The cinematography outside the special effects and what not was also very average, nothing to be amazed at like certain genius cinematographers.

70,BiiivAL,Gods of Anonymity,5,7 June 2018,"Andrew Nikkol again returns to his favorite topic (about) social science fiction. This time his fantasy creates a world of a near future, in which there is no longer any concept of anonymity. All the basic data about each person are in the public domain, and it's enough just to look at the interlocutor to find out who he is and what he achieved in life. Also, each and every without exception there is a permanent visual recording of the events taking place with him, which is archived and located in the space of the Ether, from which the detectives of the special police apparatus have access to the memories. Every citizen now has become like an open book, which is easy to scan. This, of course, is for the benefit of society, reducing the number of crimes and finally reducing everyday life to the level of monotonous despondency. But what happens if someone can keep his anonymity? With such a problem and faces the protagonist of the film Saul Freeland, investigating a series of mysterious murders, in which the offender also forges inventive inventories of memories of his victims.Referring to the topics of online surveillance and shadow total data verification by certain government agencies, the New Zealand director, however, does not risk digging a little deeper than what is originally offered to the viewer. ""Anon"" comes out with such a great generalization, the world of dominant conventions, starting from an unnamed place of action and ending with key plot points and characters. Substitution of reality here takes place not only in the eyes of Freeland, but also in the viewer - Nikkol seems to be returning to the scenery from his ""Time"", only changes the basic concept, introduces new, albeit unremarkable characters. Divorced, middle-aged detective with a classic set of tragedies of the past, depression, reflection, fatigue and alcoholism and his main opponent - lonely girl-hacker, sociopath, despises open society to which the glass walls of the world without privacy pressuring other stronger. The remaining types of the at least the templates, as well as conservative construction of the plot itself, in which everything is moving along predefined routes - from exposure, acquainting the viewer with the peculiarities of the activities of the protagonist and ending isolation, designed to cast a shadow over all this seemingly harmonious ranked utopian society.Having on hand an excellent idea that could be developed well thanks to a fantastic assumption - around the clock functioning in the mind of each interface, Nikkol prefers to focus on things simpler. His ""Anon"" is basically a standard technotriller, in which the level of intrigue is reduced to a minimum, and to study the geometric proportions of the scenery is much more interesting than watching the actions of the characters. The film after the introductory first act is too quick to make a transition from words to deeds, with every step of starting to lose touch with their own reality. Technical details, if negotiated, are only casual, and the content side is gradually surrendered under the onslaught of minor, but more curious details. Study eclectic interior loft hacker opposed to the local geometry of the totalitarian urbanism, or notice how during a given scene the characters for various reasons, look away somewhere amusing, but this impression is not vyvezesh. Niccol brings his directing style - as if detached from the observation with the academic alignment staging diluted oblique angles and close-ups with a reduced degree of emotions only adds to the feeling of total emptiness of what is happening.
Of course, ""Anona"" could save the final twist, which can turn the languidly lined intrigue into another optical illusion for the dejected viewer, but in this component the plot only finally recognizes its helplessness. The need to believe what they saw in order to protect the system from collapse here is simply a banal attempt to avoid compromise, and cause-and-effect relationships remain without due attention. Nikkol decides to play in symbolic postmodernism, completely guarding the viewer from any answers, but his thoughtful defaults look more like the lack of an ideological opportunity to develop his own concept or lead him to a logical collapse. Increasing paranoia stabilizes by itself, mysterious algorithms and databases remain in the form of graphical links of digital paths, and all motivation turns out to be an ordinary model. After all, maybe Nikkol is right - it's easier to get rid of the general in the finale and to impress the viewer that he already knows the answer, than to directly tell him the obvious conclusions. Accidents are nothing but whim, encryption of data is not reliable and it's much easier to permanently disable the interface and get rid of annoying advertisements and dice with useful information, because memories somehow always remain with us. To delete a record, according to the characters of the film, is much easier than to get rid of its contents, and at some point it seems that a little more, and the story will hit at least in the parable, but this information anti-utopia seems to be still unrevealed.",Anon

However at first at least the plot line seemed worthwhile and I thought perhaps the first unnecessary sex scene was a one off. Ha!! Someone making this movie was getting his jollies by having numerous naked women and sex scenes. I ended up fast forwarding these and lost nothing of the plot or character development (ha! again, almost non existent) by doing so.
Good movie making doesn't have to rely on gratuitous sex scenes, (or swearing for that matter). This had so much potential but lost all credibility with these scenes plus overacted characters like the Police Commissionaire.

I do enjoy ones that are more believable but I really don't care if there's a scene or two where something happens that's prob is a little unrealistic.

I'm 40 & world was a lot dif in 80's & we go back even further & im sure people would look at high speed trains, fancy cars, robots & airplanes and think they were on an alien planet.

Plot holes, they are being a little over dramatic. I mean seriously, do they need their hand held & have every single characters entire life from birth to the present laid out for em & have every angle of the story covered at all times. 90% of the time the people complaining about plot holes really are complaining about something pretty insignificant to the movie as a whole. Of course the other 10% have an actual gripe but most often they are just dissecting & over-analyzing as usual and too busy getting the gene siskel on the realize it don't really mattersThis was a Netflix original & those can be hit or miss sometimes but this was def a hit on their end.

As technology becomes more and more advanced, it's hard not to believe that at some point tech won't merge with the human body in some way that seems scary to those of us who grew up before the internet.
Anon features a great concept of hackers being able to manipulate people's personal tech, again, much like Ghost in the Shell, and commit various crimes by making themselves blind from the views of others. The way the technology and world is presented is very skillful, without tons of exposition, just allowing you the viewer to learn about the world shown in the way a movie should educate the viewer: by showing and not telling. Thankfully, there's no scene where some technician explains how the eye-lens and brain-tech works. Nobody in that world would look that up, how often do you look up how your microwave works? Do you even really know how it does, to an intimate level? Most sci-fi makes the mistake of having the characters explain things too much for the benefit of the audience in un-natural conversations. 
Anon's actual mystery component isn't stunning or extremely astounding, but it's worth a watch for the great performances, and how the future-tech intelligently figures into the story, and how it's presented. A solid watch.",Anon

It challenges views to really think and because of that challenge, that's why I rated it 9 and writng this review.First this film has a solid performance by Clive Owen. I appreciated his work in ""Children of Men,"" and this performance is just as good. I seems deadpan, but I empathized with his character, particularly as certain memories begin to be wiped from his sight (literally).This idea of ""wiping memories"" is another reason why I recommend this film to you. The effects are unbelieavable when these effects are showing how we are networked--and the scary part of this movie is that these special effects REALLY to mirror our digital lives today. Think of how hard it would be for anyone of use to go ""off the grid"" with the footprints we leave EVERY WHERE. This film explores this idea both with its effects and its theme.Lastly, I recommend this film because it is SOOOO ""film noirish."" I know the debates over whether noir is a genre or style. Doesn't matter to me. This film capture either and for this ""flashback"" to another time is one reason this film is solid for me and can be for you if you will allow it the time to work its magic on you.I have to confess that I saw this video on my computer and thar lessens the impact. I wish I had seen this on a big screen in a theater to relish to details. If anyone is interested in a university thesis, I would recommend simply analyzing the huge amount of text that is shown and assessing what this information communicates.

94,Chris_Ego,It's a student film at best,4,10 May 2021,"This Netflix production from 2018 came out at an interesting time of data privacy and the premise was on point. Acknowledging that it lacks in so many other areas.Here are a few no-go's: the acting is shallow. Everybody drags themselves through the movie without raising a single eyebrow. This is unbelievable even in a cold world that is displayed here. I couldn't connect with anyone but the two lead characters.The police finds a potential victim in the digital realm and waits for hours for something to happen. Yet nobody thinks about protecting this poor fella.The music has no theme, no motif and is pretty random throughout the movie.It's a shame that the film isn't compelling and didn't turn out to be as good as it could have been. The story is good, the lead characters have interesting perspectives of the world and there is potential in the way how the memory travels are visualised. There are even nods to ""Minority Report"", ""Gattaca"" and Orwell's ""1984"". Plus ""The Girl"" has a lot to say about her stand with data privacy, so we even get a message to ponder.Sadly the classic setting with all the 50s interior, the old cars and the faible for analog household items does not fit the presentation of the movie. There are many contradictions and it feels like a student film with a bigger budget. It's like the writers wanted to warn us from data theft and digital surveillance but couldn't agree on how to put that into a good storyline. It was the first 20 minutes that made me realise it won't be a good film and indeed it didn't get better. Even the ending was predictable that early on.But hey, don't let me keep you from watching it! Some things turned out great. Amanda Seyfried is a real asset to the cast. There are many camera angles that are executed in a very artful way. The cinematography is perfect and the editing is fine. It's just that the picture as a whole didn't resonate with me.",Anon

But Netflix' Black Mirror is an outstanding series, mixed equally with people of all races, genders and LGBT people.

99,gillies,Example of what Sci Fi ought to be,9,26 January 2019,"This starts with a great premise, that everyone has a digital recorder in their brain and can replay memories in perfect fidelity from their entire life. Not only that, everybody is networked together, so that after a crime, the police can replay memories and figure out was at fault. This this is a world. Where nothing. Can. Go. Worng. (to borrow a Westword 1970 ad placard). Sal Frieland is a detective confronted with a hacker who erases his presence in murders, replacing the murdered corpse's memories with his own viewing angle as he fires the gun. The goal is to apprehend this murderer before they kill again, so Sal Frieland goes undercover to lure the murderer into his life. But, there is a twist and as he closes in on the murderer, this person hacks into his own brain and starts to play hallucinations that would make a trip on Heroin look like a day in the park.This is a classic film noir, shot (almost) in black and white, and the characters do a great job living up to the genre.

It's like someone decided to stick a ""porn"" film in the middle of a ""sci-fi"" film. Now I can appreciate both, but mixing the two distracts from the more interesting ideas of the latter.
 The most annoying part however; is that the protagonist spends the whole movie hunting down a murdering female, who in the end turns out to just be another ""damsel in distress"", that he is obligated to save from the real killer, who of course is a male. You can see the ""lovey-dovey"" ending coming from the middle of the film. It's a like Disney film with a little ""porn"" thrown in.

103,infoalwaysacritic,Disappointing,4,5 May 2018,"If Clive Owen and Dystopian futures playing off of the Ghost in the Shell-like concept of hacking coming together sound like a good idea, then the premise of this film might be right up your alley. As a fan of both concepts of futurist cinema, the premise is all there, and with its slow-moving plot, surreal POV camera work that is painfully slow and characters unable to use their brains, the execution leaves much to be desired while its portrayal of women could be considered contemptuous.
Clive Owen plays a detective that works in a criminal system that can see everything and recall everything because it's recorded. This big brother concept takes a twist by placing the recording device in the eyes of its people, and it is by hacking the eyes and recordings in people's minds that a string of murders take place while concealing the identity of the killer - who imposes their own vision over the senses of those they kill. As the main character says, this brings the police back to a genuine ""who done it"". If the story followed a ""who done it plot"", then this wouldn't be too bad, but the police seem to be incapable of using basic forensics, which leads to over an hour of sitting around tables while staring off into space, smoking, drinking and shagging hookers instead.On a visual level, the stark environments are desaturated even further in editing, adding to the underlying tension of the film. Sets are concrete, institutionalized and imposing structures, which could have been symbolic but aren't fully realized within the plot. Societal regression might even be considered as a visual element considering the nostalgia that persists in characters' near-constant smoking and drinking in suits cut in a style that is reminiscent of the 50's. Sadly, there is barely a woman in the film who isn't there to take of their clothes and spread their legs. It might be considered a shame that women couldn't find a role in in this movie without having to have sex for it.The lynch pin for psychological thrillers of this kind could be said to be in the pondering of greater societal questions. In this case there is some thought to the impact of current technology and the implications of cybernetics and transparency that isn't without merit, though as a story there isn't a grand reveal or a strong conclusion.",Anon
104,imdb-23821,"Great visuals, excellent players, some holes",6,30 July 2021,"This film is far better than the rating suggests. Great production value. Terrific cast that gives its all to sell the film. In essence, everyone appears to have some type of implant in their eyes and what they see is recorded. Only the people individually and law enforcement can have access to your memory recordings, making it easier to catch wrongdoers and primarily serving to deter crime before it happens. Looking at objects are fed into a computer and the user gets to see information about what they are seeing, much like exists in rudimentary form today.However, there is a killer who is ""off the grid"" who has been doing jobs for hire killing people while hacking into the recording and making it appear from the eyes of the viewer. These unknown anons seem to not only be able to do this but also send images back to the viewer's lenses and see things that don't exist as if they did. They can also modify and delete all prior recordings too. Clive is a detective seeking to find the anon.This is a slower scifi film, similar in the manner of Bladerunner although nowhere near that level of excellence. Part of the problem is that the film itself betrays the premise it's trying so hard to sell and has some logic problems. For example (no spoiler just concept), if you wanted to kill someone, it would seem to be easy. Feed their eyes a different image, such as a sidewalk where there really is a busy street, and let them walk into an oncoming truck. Or if you can delete recordings, DELETE THE ENTIRE RECORDING instead of constructing a fake one.At the beginning of the film, the director wants to make a morality point how Clive/Sal decides to not to prosecute a maid who steals a bracelet because the complainant has annoyed him terribly. All the while I was thinking ""why wouldn't the maid close her eyes and steal something or look away while she grabs the bracelet with her hand?There are also other logic errors, e.g. Aassuming there isn't any backup copy of digital recordings somewhere in cold storage. It's common practice these days. But this assumes it's all connected and can be deleted in an instant.The denouement also falls apart badly. Very badly. This is a very watchable great six with unfortunate flaws.So yes, it's totally silly scifi at times and not well thought through. But the actors really sell the script well and does hold some elements of a whodonit. It's infuriating that this is a common problem with Hollywood films and one that perfectionists like Nolan do NOT get wrong or at least hides flaws well so they are secondary.

105,breckstewart,I Really Like This One,9,7 January 2020,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect but the subject matter seemed very promising. As I got into it, I started to really enjoy the story which is rather slow yes but I still had the feeling that somehow, it would lead somewhere.The acting is really good by Clive Owen and especially Amanda Seyfried who impresses as the girl with a mission, reminding me of the character she played in the movie ""In Time"" back in 2011. With a brown wig and those soulful stares, she made ""The Girl"" totally memorable and she really is the stand out in this movie.The effects are well rendered but not overdone and even though there is some action, if someone expects a whole lot of shooting and violence, they might be disappointed although there are some bloody scenes. The slow pace picked up progressively as we find out more about The Girl's world and how detective Sal Frieland (Owen) gets sucked into her web so to speak.The subject matter is rather appropriate and current in this day and age where total privacy is but a pipe dream and I must admit, I even liked the ending which, even though not every loose bit was resolved, is totally satisfying to me. I have this thing where if the ending of a movie is too open ended or botched up, I really resent it but this one was perfectly adequate.I give this a solid 9 stars and anyone who enjoys a well crafted and intelligent thriller should appreciate it. Unfortunately, the movie was a total flop at the box office so it was mostly overlooked but I think it deserves an audience and I for one am very happy I gave it the chance it deserves.",Anon

It's a world where everyone is accountable for their actions, because their actions cannot be hidden. We can immediately imagine the benefits of such technology because lying, cheating, stealing and murder cannot occur in an environment where everyone's digital record can be accessed, and evidence of consciousness of guilt gets written and stored on your digital brain, which can then be either downloaded or shared telepathically.However, in the real human world, the desire to lie, cheat, steal and murder does not go away, simply because there is technology to uncover one's deeds. In the real world, people want privacy for non-nefarious as well as nefarious deeds. And in Anon, this is where computer hackers come to engage and sell their services. One such hacker specializes in erasing client's records, as well as the records of those who interacted with her client in planning or engaging in criminal, and sub-criminal deeds. The only problem is that there is a serial killer killing off the hacker's clients and framing the hacker for the murders.Anon is both an original and clever movie which addresses the philosophical question of how much information should the government have regarding your personal life, your thoughts and your memories, all at the expense of privacy and anonymity. It forces the viewer into a creepy world where your personal thoughts are public, and that nothing is secret, or even worse, that your record can be altered.I'm not sure if Anon is as much original as it is simply taking existing technology and extrapolating where tech companies, and a police state would love to have tech go. Because it has not been done before, and subtly integrates into the discussion, the tension of the technology privacy debate, and a serial killer, Anon, gets high marks for originality. This simply has not been done before.Anon, however, doesn't go the whole mile. Anon disappoints in that it had the potential to be a truly superb film. The failure to show the political, social and economic struggle as to how the world got to the point of implementing such technology is a catastrophic failure in that it suggests that this level of intrusion is simply the new normal, and that there is, and was never outrage behind its implementation. WTF. It also, fails to discuss or elaborate the potential for such technology to be weaponized or simply create world wide anarchy.Additionally, I took issue with (1) slow pace of the film (2) underdevelopment of the serial killer (3) somewhat monotone acting and (4) seemingly lack of suspense and drama, given the potential issues which could have been incorporated into the film.The above issues notwithstanding, it is the kind of movie, you get drawn into to watch and listen, because there are some good nuggets in the script.

It tries to learn what I like, what I don't, where I've been, where I've avoided... so there's that. Perhaps we're another form of luddites here in 21st century thinking we're entitled to our privacy in an age where ""connected"" is the norm.In any case, the psychological aspect of the movie is just as interesting as the political. Having the power to anonymously look into other people's lives is tempting but ultimately corrupting to the soul. How would that effect you knowing that you could be watched just the same? What would that say about you as you're having so much fun with your peep show into a bystanders life?Perhaps we all do have something to hide and perhaps we'd like to keep it a secret no matter how trivial but that never stops us from wondering about what others might be hiding or how they're acting when they don't know when somebody is watching them, mundane as it might be. It's perhaps got something to do with power or some form of conditioning where we separate our innate desires and public persona from an early age so that we are all destined to be paranoid schizophrenics.Nobody (excluding her) knows how I have sex with my girlfriend. That's not something I'd like to share with the world, especially people who know me. Is it because I think what we do is depraved? That's what a lot of people would think first, before questioning why anyone would like to share intimate parts of their lives with strangers, against their consent. If someone had the power to peek into my world, could they be trusted to not peek for their curiosity or amusement?then there is the flip side of the coin, where we want to be seen and heard.

A psycho-analyst could have a field day following our comment thread, what we choose to reveal about ourselves given the opportunity. Social media shows us the worst in us at times, where we're most transparent when we think we have the protection of anonymity. If there was nothing but anonymity, would our civilized society crumble when we no longer feel like we have to follow social norms linked to our identity?This movie is so relevant, because at some point we have to decide what the future will look like and like any good cyberpunk fiction, the emphasis is on flawed humanity rather than the tech itself.

What disturbed me most greatly was at about the 19 minute mark, when the two ""agents"" for want of a better word, are sitting on a wall discussing the ghost assassin. I felt like figuratively/metaphysically ""butting into"" their conversation, and saying, ""Hmm, just imagine if we had something that could help identify who she is. Oh yeah, wait -we do!!! It's called a visual memory"". It's not really a criticism of the film per se, but it is a reflection on even the present society we all inhabit. And the observation is this, sadly in today's world a majority of people have ceded/delegated/surrendered a part of their psyche to digital devices. Also a worryingly significant portion of their thought processes has been impaired through reliance on, and addiction to such devices - primarily smartphones, but increasingly an ever-more bizarre array of headsets, eyepieces, ""fitness"" trackers, and various other monitors and ""tech"". What I'm trying to get at so clumsily, is the fact that if we don't have a massive course change in our current trajectory, we are rapidly in danger of losing our humanity.

116,mrvanin,A naive story from a SF paperback anthology,5,23 August 2020,"This movie is like a typical short story from those 1970's SF paperback anthologies. You know that a third of the stories will be meh-to-okay, half will be garbage and the remaining less-than-twenty-percent might be a good read.Anon falls into the ""Okay"" group. The writer has a usable idea, the characters are easily understood, the future is all grey, unpainted, concrete with minimalist furnishings and empty streets - and the magical technology is invisible and very few seem to actually understand it.Unfortunately, the execution of the movie is utterly unimaginative. Sets, costumes and vehicles rely on that rusty old dodge of using Retro to indicate Futuristic, because contemporary styling dates an SF movie so hilariously quickly. But that aside, the technical and logical holes in the story spoil it profoundly. I also found the POV scenes, where a sprite of an inanimate, gloved hand holding a revolver is used like a cursor in any of a million shoot-em-up computer games, incredibly stupid. My first reaction was to think that the POV was being rendered by futuristic AI to recreate the scene for the investigators. Reinforcing this feeling is the unrealistically slow and smooth panning of the scene - like a surveillance camera instead of the movement of a human eye.I think that Clive Owen did the best he could with what he was given. The same goes for Amanda Seyfried, while looking as desirable as ever - with dark hair and bangs, she's a lovely dish. I don't think anyone else could have added to her performance. The rest of the cast were nonentities - especially the commissioner and the bad guy. I don't think I would recognise them in another movie.",Anon

The idea is interesting, albeit very Black Mirror-esque, and the special effects are subtle enough to convey the premise well. However, it's the future and the main character is smoking cigarettes like it's 1987?There are way too many script cliches and tacky one-liners to a point it distracts from the plot. Of which there seems to be little of as the movie progresses. The promising start seems to get watered down drastically with the bad script and mediocre delivery (sometimes it's hard to distinguish which is at fault). Cheap nudity is abound, a shoehorned sex scene (Amanda Seyfried's trademark), all the tell tale signs of low confidence in the plot's interest levels. The problem with the plot is that even the gratuitous nudity couldn't keep it afloat. The dead son sub-plot was an interesting touch that wasn't explored enough. Instead of deepening the character it was brushed off as leverage for cheap tension. Somehow more hookers seemed more important to the plot's progression than building the characters.The decisions made by the main character (Sal) are at best baffling, I don't understand that character nor was I able to relate to him in any way.I will not watch this movie again nor will I recommend it to anyone.",Anon

120,pietroschek,Oldschool cyberpunk on tranquilizer...,6,4 April 2019,"The movie Anon is not a sci-fi movie, as it fits closer to the cyberpunk genre. Movies like 'Blade Runner', 'Johnny Mnemonic' & such can vaguely help to conjure-back that kinda atmosphere. If one considers 'I, Robot' a murder mystery, then this one has vague similarities.The focus is the vulnerability of computers, as the detectives have an implant keeping them online 24/7 and jamming their perceptions now and then.The interplay between Clive Owen & Amanda Seyfried works, though the storytelling is not really eager to make it all plausible aka easily-understandable to the audience. There is an indie streak of punky attitude here, and I don't mean being tired of the BREXIT media poo.An alcoholic police detective, haunted by the death of his son, gets drawn into a murder case, within which the killer manipulates the cyber-cameras each citizen has implanted, to get away with the crimes.The idea is: Signal riding. What, if your connection includes a shadowy lurker, who can manipulate the connection with everything pointing at you, when it goes awry? ;-)The title I chose tells the main backlash: The movie is slow, lacking some action and story-bolstering. Can't say phoning the ex-wife or banging the cool blackhat woman (damn, that hacker myth is so over-nerded) redeemed that.All in all a calmer and streamlined classic of the genre without any innovative or spectacular parts. Interesting lesson on discarding the cop, when he is no longer of use (in the end of the movie).""It is not that I got anything to hide, it is that I don't want you to see anything of me any longer..?""",Anon

124,Ska4Live,"Correct idea for current time, but realisation.....",6,9 May 2018,"Last work from Andrew Niccol is probably exactly that thing what you can expect from this kind of Director and Writer. Nearest future in grey anti-utopia tone, where bio-technologies playing key role in society. The whole idea in ""ANON"" - not new. The same technologies and what it may cause we saw in s1ep3 - of ""Black Mirror"" and the way how police work in this near fiction future is a little similar like it was in ""Minority Report (2002)"". 
Lets start from the beginning. In the nearest future all citizens in big cities has implants in the eyes, which gave them an augmented reality interface(next in text - ARI) together with lot of functions, such as: to record info from eyes \transmit this information \use free hands applications and solution (messaging, calls, money transfer, browsing web and searching etc ). Where technologies like this exists, you understand that Police department playing absolute God-mode role in society. Each crime (robbery, killing, suicide, corruption) can be seen by police department from victim or killer eyes perspective. Which is why every crime finds its justice in few hours. There is no more - unknown persons on the streets. Each citizen has it's name, bio, family information, information from job and so on. Everything is changed when police find dead bodies, where the last recording seconds is display video content only from killer eyes, instead of victim. This brings police to strange situation - integrated eyes chips was hacked by someone (Anon). Main police investigation in face of Sr.Detective - Sal Frieland (performed by Clive Owen), are focusing only (!) on main suspect - Unknown Girl (performed by Amanda Seyfried). Because Detective Sal Frieland saw her at the beginning of movie(!). The next what you will see is standard scheme: Operation 'Undercover' with ""F2F meeting"" and ""In the bed with enemy"" stages; Pain from the past; Eyes 'tricks'; ""It's a trap ! ""; Liars is around us; Nice quote at the end. It is actually all about story line.
Now, I want give a credit to a beautiful visual work and operator work, when we see ARI with its algorithms, schematic view of proxy servers, video content played from people memory, video editing. Its truly brilliant! But there is a lot things which makes mark this movie with only 6 stars only . First of all, dialogs is completely cheesy and sounds like 5 year old kid wrote it; in 80% of dialogs - actors aren't acting, they just keep poker faces. And a phrases: ""How should we found our killer?"", ""What to do now if we don't have killer's face?"" are completely destroy Clive Owen as an actor. Maybe i demand a lot from an actors and they just acted according a script. But Seriously guys! Maybe you can drawn a picture of your suspect, such tactic worked back in 19 and 20 centuries. Also one thing about ARI, we, as a audience need to understand what is proxy servers? what is algorithm in video editing means? what does mean numbers on each corner of square, when person trying to saw video content from history? 
Anyway, I felt some disappoint.... No, I am very disappointed from ""ANON""! The idea is correct! In term of latest Facebook privacy data breach, USA election hacking, and growing e-technologies market. All of this make timing of this film - correct. But the way how it was directed\ written together with acting performance, doesn't give me a chance to mark this film with higher star.",Anon

The 'Facebook' generation is unlikely to understand why, and I suspect hence the low reviews. The above phrase made a large impact on my rating of this movie. No explosions or wild chases in this one, so it mustn't be good, right? I happen to think it was very well thought out, from the whole idea of no longer being able to be anonymous, to the vector-line superimposed visual interface of the 'mind's eye'. A very sobering look into what a future society without anonymity would be like, with both the benefits and disadvantages that would entail.

129,ChronicCinephilia,A very poor movie indeed.,4,15 May 2018,"This movie carried the tagline ""stylish sci-fi thriller"" and I'm here to tell you it ain't.Let me first mention that throughout the movie there's gratuitous nudity and scenes of sex. I'm a man who appreciates a nice pair of boobs as much as anyone but it wont make up for the lack of substance. Clive has sex with a high class hooker, we see the sex scene again as the hacker tries to remove that memory from the ""ether"", then he bangs the hacker as well. It's quite laughable really but I expect men who are of low intelligence and fancy themselves as a bit of a ladies man might be sucked in.The movie itself, in terms of its sci-fi merit, is a miss. It's a detective solving a crime in a future where everything is the same except for something called the ""ether"". The ""ether"" is basically a data collection of everything your eyes have ever looked at your view can be live streamed. The hacker protagonist in this movie can manipulate that data and therefore is a person of interest. There's a twist at the end but it's underwhelming to say the least.I'm a huge fan of the sci-Fi genre. Scanner Darkly, Oblivion, Minority Report, Blade Runner, Total Recall, Aliens, Terminator, you name it I'm in to it. This however is a very tame and uninspiring movie that brings no new concepts to the table and there's very little effort made in terms of the CGI or acting. A truly forgettable experience.",Anon

I don't want to give any spoiler, so I won't. I found the plot interesting and the twist - ok. I am a fan of anti-utopias, so I can't say the idea was surprising and novel, but the actors were good and they made me contemplate how the story develops and think about it afterwards.

Some of the acting was a bit flat, but it's possible it was late-40s-50s-style to support the noirish flavor. The plot tells just enough really. The details and backstory served well enough to bring home the terror of erased memories (to me). I think i got the gist of the villain's motivation, but I could've missed something.The examination of technology and its incorporation into policing, the legal system and crime is frightening, regardless of plotholes. The term ""transparency"" gets turned on its head and refers to the government's right to know everything about us, instead of our right to knowledge about the actions of our government.In this era of increasing mechanization of surveillance, analysis, decision-making, information sharing, deepfakes and warfare, this movie looks at some possible pitstops along the way to complete loss of autonomy, self and the concept of truth.

There's a gritty cop with a troubled past, a corrupt governing system, an ineffective senior cop and a poorly thought through overexplained plan to catch the villain.

The protagonist is seen hiding evidence in a theft case because he didn't like the victim and wanted to help the criminal. We are supposed to feel empathy for this man because with his action he's helping a person in need, while completely disregarding the fact that this shows the police has put themselves above the law.Hiding from this all-seeing eye is also extremely simple: close your own eyes and no record of any crime is registered.
But this is also a contradictory point within the movie: the scenes where we look through someone else's eyes there is no blinking, no head bobbing, no surroundings, no sudden movements... but when the plot needs it closing your own eyes actually obscures the recording.There are also a few gunshot fired but apparently we are not looking at a human story because all the people shot are androids and have no blood whatsoever...",Anon

I love the electronic soundscape music which reminded me of Mr Robot.It does feel like this kind of connection between humans is not so far away, and the right to remain anonymous is slowly being erased/eroded from our lives as we appear in our own social media, but more to the point we also appear accidentally in other peoples pictures, videos, memories etc. These are things beyond our control that build a full picture of who we are. This to me seemed to be the drive of the film.The logic stays on point, things are carefully worked out so they make sense, apart from one really big plot hole. which is WHY? Why does the murderer decide to murder these people? It's never really explained, or maybe it is and I just didn't work it out, but it left me a little confused at the end, good film I might watch again to see if I can pick up more of the plot I feel I'm missing something.All in all the cast are solid, I love Clive Owen he's always worth watching and Amanda Seyfried was good too.

There are no set piece runs, car chases, nor space fighter clashes. If that is your measure of entertainment, you will have to look elsewhere.Apparently, the movie shares ideas with a black window, or mirror, or some other such TV show. It also has echoes of Minority Report. There are elements of the story evoking a 1984-ish concern with loss of privacy. I fail to understand this as a criticism. They say that there are seven basic stories in English literature. Accepting this, one might think that a movie may revisit an element of a previous movie or two.As far as I'm concerned, the movie had a solid premise, a decent script, and great actors (by the way, Colm Feore has always been criminally underrated). I enjoyed it.Sure, it is slow. Sometimes, ideas evolve that way. As with almost every movie, one could criticize this scene, or that dialogue, or maybe a choice here and there by a director or editor. This movie will not win the Oscar for best picture. It will not go down on your list of all time classics.That said, it is well done & entertaining. I didn't rate it an 8 or 9, because it's not a classic. It was however, a movie that I would recommend to anyone. I think that I have watched Casablanca over 40 times. By comparison, over the years, I will likely watch this one around 5 or 6.As an aside, what is with this hatred on here for naked people? I have not yet gone through male menopause, so seeing beautiful naked people does not really ruin the better part of my month.Lighten up, Francis.",Anon
158,mchertov,Story and acting ALMOST save the movie,7,19 May 2018,"This movie isn't great by any means. However, it's also not the worst movie in the world. I am a big fan of Clive Owen, so naturally I thought I'd try this out. Both Owen and Amanda Seyfried give decent performances. However, the somewhat slow pace and lackluster dialogue all but cancel the good acting out.The story is decent, with a ""Black Mirror"" feel. Conceptually, very interesting. The execution could have been significantly better though. The climax is surprisingly anti-climatic (though there is a decent twist), and the ending leaves you wanting more.I'd say this is an airplane movie. Not great, but something to watch.",Anon

Anybody that saw her automatically had their replay video memory of her erased, so the police were dumbfounded when they didnt have video of how she looked like. UM, HELLO? How about get a sketch artist?? So anyway Sal decided to make a fake life for himself to get her next to him, I suppose? When he went to meet Anon, it turns out that it was an AsianAnon.... Different person. Then he tried again, and this time a MaleAnon, Sal of course tried again.
So let me get this straight, right, theyre breaking the law too, and is still extremely dangerous to society but they will get away with it, they wont even be tracked?? You guys found out that this is not just a 1 person job, this is an organization.. Of probably MANY organizations. So what makes this Anon so different is that they have proof of her murdering people? I mean. They think its her... When really it could have been any female Anon (female hand on the murder weapon). AND also remember that organization thing I was talking about? You're guaranteed that theres many big dogs who are making a lot of money off of erasing memories, some are probably the creators of the program. Big deal. Right? You think they will let her get away with killing customers? Killing your customers is terrible business, and not to mention that it attracts the attention of the police. Thats enough for her to, ""disappear.""
So.. Sal finally met with 25Anon in his apartment, with his detective partner in the next apartment listening to every thing shes saying.... By his technology in his eye balls. Okay guys. But this time you think that you'll be smart enough to use a tape recorder, video camera, considering that she will hack into your eye software to erase all the evidence you have.For some reason they just let her go, and claims, ""she got away."" No fools, you let her walk out the front door.When Sal had a flashback of 25Anon being naked thats when I lost complete interest. It had the potential to be so good.",Anon

Feels more like a plot device.The POV shots are very slow and unrealistically on-rails, I can't tell if this was an intentional creative choice or just an inability to properly emulate what it looks like to view the world from our eyes.
You have to strike a balance between how it was done here and the handheld style usually employed.There is a reveal in the 3rd act that is utterly emotionally flat.The soundtrack, editing and world of the movie hold everything in a kind of detached embrace of melancholy. Relevant themes and concept but this really should have been a more interesting/engaging movie. Great visual style, as expected from Niccol. His movie's cars are always cool af.

The main character always see's people as a moving digital profiles and can log in to them anytime to access what is in deep. 
Now in this film, that hacker turns out to be a girl and suspected for serious crimes. The twist at the end was so poor, always there is a bad guy who mislead good people. It combines the great ideas of the watch dog's game with a crime storyline and Noir- like atmosphere. But that do not work.

I don't know much as pertains to cinematography, but I found the bleakness of it to go with the story. The only real luxuries were in The Girl's home and even those were sparce.
I thought the story perfectly paced and entertaining. The actors did a great job. Sal was a depressed middle aged man and Owen's did a great job expressing that. Seyfried's The Girl was bland and emotionless because she had cut herself off from society to maintain her anonymity/privacy. You can't be most popular and anonymous.
I did guess the bad guy correctly the first time they were shown, but there were no overt clues, I'm just the Nostradamus of movie villains. There was a lot more nudity than I was expecting, but it wasn't overwhelming.
I think people reviewing these movies take themselves way too seriously🤷‍♀️. I typically like fast paced action or comedy movies with a little sci-fi bonus so I didnt know if I'd like it, but I would definitely recommend this. In fact, I already have and I just finished it 10 minutes ago.",Anon
173,stefanelectric,THis is a Mind Blowing Film !,10,13 July 2018,I don't care what others think this film is beautiful to look at . And probably one of the best performances Clive Owen and Amanda Seyfried has had since CHLOE. Andrew Niccol did it this time for sure this is his cinematography yet. In Time I thought was OK but the look of the film was pretty basic. This film has some sexy atmosphere and some super nice apartment buildings . The films takes place in the distant future and is on time with whats happening now. Yes we have the right to give up our privacy now . But in this film everyone has proxy's and those proxy's can be traced back to anything you do. Anon basically has avoided this system somehow . And is resistant and works as a undercover eraser for clients. So in the film authorities want apprehend her for the deaths of her clients . And to figure out how she is able to avoid the system and not have a known identity. The mysterious young woman is then submerged into a web of deceit and drama. I think the film is bold and original and I am surprised it went straight to Netflix with all the current reboots and irrelevant sequel that are out there in Hollywood. The only thing that I didn't like was the ending . I felt like there could have been a deeper explanation for everything. Instead they just kinda through it all in one thing . With such a deep philosophical story I think the ending could have been more elevated . I really hope that we can see more things like this in the future in the movie theater.,Anon

How can any self respecting actor say the line: ""your of the case"" and not start crying about the failure he has become. And the drinking cop with a troubled past that falls for the femme fatale. Come on people. If we are going to recycle every lazy idea from the past then at least change it up bit. Like Tarantino did with kill bill. Let's create Jessica Bourne,Jane Bond who shaggs and dumps every guy she meets. The question of race I don't dare touch but it's obvious that the public is bored with middle aged white men.

It started off alright, i'll give it that, but it progressively seemed to get more and more dull and a lot of it just felt as though it was filler in order to stretch out the story in order to make it into a full length movie when batting it out in fourty minutes could be done easily.I don't think calling it a bad movie is accurate, I just don't think it's worth any kind of negativity either, since it didn't give me any emotions whatsoever.It is an interesting concept and plot on paper, and the description on Netflix was vague enough to have me interested, but it feels like I wasted any expectations I had, and in the first five minutes I realised that I was not going to enjoy the movie as much as I would have liked to.I feel like this movie would have blown my mind if I was a bit younger when I liked almost everything I watched because I didn't have a concept of what separates good movies from the bad movies. But since I'm older and have seen a lot of good and bad movies, I've learnt the difference between the two even though others might disagree with my opinions.But this movie felt like just a hug waste of time but also a relief that it's over and I don't have to waste time continuing it.It felt like a really bad episode of Black Mirror, and it probably would have been great if the directors of Black Mirror's more popular episodes had directed this too.To end this review I just want to say I don't hate the film, it left me feeling very indifferent and I see the film as not very special and I hope that the director can learn to grow with their work.",Anon

Whether you think of Bitcoin and it's blockchain technology, the Facebook data sold to spin doctors world wide (in the UK and the US, that we know of).

The track-record of this film-maker speeks for itself. He's been on this very issue of fundamental freedoms for decades and he is not new to the sci-fi genre. Indeed Writer/Director Andrew Niccol started questionning major philosophical and now everyday issues, back in the 90s when he made the screen adaptation of ""A Brave New World"" by Aldous Huxley (1932), the formidable Gattaca (1997). Some writers have it in them to question whether our fundamental freedoms are endangered by technology and this one has consistently done so over the years, with the brilliant Truman Show or Lord of War, and his work skillfully brings us to the depth of the questions he asks in a very entertaining fashion, and whether it is a drama or a comedy, it is always relevant.

223,roggio-666-739768,An Engaging & Entertaining Science Fiction Film,8,5 May 2018,"Anon was like a warm breeze on a summer evening. It was a relief from the bloody and bad science fiction often found on Netflix or other streaming services. (Or at the box office for that matter). The film was interesting enough to be engaging. Sexy enough to be arousing. But not too violent. This last bit is a very good thing. Too many films, in my opinion, are overtly violent or gory. As a viewer, gore is the last thing I want to see. It tells me the filmmakers have no real plot, no real story to tell so they go for the gross out. So bravo to Anon for avoiding too much violence.Please don't misunderstand. Andrew Niccol's Anon has violence. There is, after all, a murderer on the loose. The audience sees several killings. Blood is shown. But it is not punishing. It is not over board. You won't be compelled to look way or delete some scene from your memory.There is, however, sex. In fact, if one wanted to argue anything in Anon was, perhaps, excessive, it would be sex and female nudity. There are many, extended scenes showing various parts of actresses Amanda Seyfried, Sara Mitich, Jordan Claire Robbins, Sierra Wooldridge, and Alyson Bath. At least two of these scenes were graphic enough to be uncomfortable in mixed company.Overall, Anon was entertaining. It was thought provoking.

It is about privacy of information and vulnerability. The only thing I think is missing is the message of the movie. It's not that it lacks a message or depht, it's just that the whole lesson the film intends to teach us is only seen in the ending scene.
""It's not that I've got something to hide; it's just that I don't have anything I want you to see.""
This is the whole message the movie wants to let out. It's not seen throughout the entire movie, it only appears in the very end. It should have been an entire comment around our privacy, the data controlling... but it's simply a message almost in the ending credits.

Not to mention, a Clive Owen fan. It is a premise worth exploring over and over again. The loss of privacy, especially to such an extent, is a nightmare and every day that passes, such a Big Brother reality seems to become more and more plausible. There are several plot holes that I did not mind overlooking, as the message is what is important here. However there is one that ,for me, killed the plausibility of the plot and could have ended the movie right there. In such a high-tech age, have we all forgotten about low-tech ways of obtaining evidence? Why could someone just not have an external body-cam on to record Anon?

247,lasse-990-403492,Implausible implementation of a good concept,3,10 May 2018,"I really liked the concept of this movie, but the way they've portrayed it makes it very hard to sort of believe in the premise. What I mean that if you believe that such a universe could exist, where the things they say are possible, are actually possible, then the movie still have to portray a believable universe within those confines.It doesn't, not by a long shot.Warning, spoilers ahead.So the concept is that you have cameras in your eyes, so everything, everywhere, is recorded, all the time. You also have computer-hardware implants which allows you to see information on top of what you're seeing, and even watch archived footage.However, the videoes we look at from supposedly peoples eyes are impossible to believe were actually caught from someones eyes. Nobody looks at things like that. You don't slowly pan your eyes around a scene before you end up looking at the thing you were going to look at.I guess this was done to set a certain style of the movie, but they couldn't have made the movie harder to believe in if they had broken the fourth wall.Additionally, we see a couple of scenes where we supposedly see a movie caught from the killers eyes, and the same viewpoint is also projected into the eyes of the person about to be killed. In essence, they see what the killer sees, themselves. Why then are people looking at themselves from behind, and doesn't turn around? It makes absolutely no sense at all.So the concept was a good one, but style was much more important apparently than to try to create a universe one could believe in.",Anon

261,john-80325,"Fantasy, not Sci-Fi",7,7 May 2018,"This is not a science fiction movie. This is a fantasy movie where the magic looks technological. It's not a case of ""any sufficiently advanced technology,"" because, other than the magic, nothing in the movie was necessarily newer than the 1970s. There's no LEDs. There's still cigarettes. There's still physical cash. Nothing has advanced. It felt sort of like Dark City, before anyone knew what was going on. If people had all their information technology built behind their eyeballs and could fashion their environment however they like, very few would choose that look. Very few would choose the same look as was chosen by others. The ""technology"" had no limitations, no way of being turned off, no explanation for how it worked. Everyone accepts that there's a magical mediator between their eyeballs and their brain, but not between any of their other senses and their brain. The government seems corrupt and wants an end to privacy, but there's no targeted advertising - in fact there's comparatively little advertising, especially for an urban setting. They ask why the magician (""hacker"") meets clients in person, but not why upper level cops are working in physical proximity to one another and wearing neckties when there's almost nothing they do that isn't electronically mediated. There's a connection between the magic and door locks, but it isn't connected to vehicle brakes, although automatic transmissions seem to be popular and it can automatically judge velocities and momentum well enough to tell people when to brake. The auteur wanted to make a point about privacy, but it kind of fell flat, because like the male protagonist, we're cast adrift among forces beyond our own control. The only rationale for why the world it as it is shown is ""I wanted it to look that way."" As an anchor for a moral compass, it seems like a sea anchor, and, regardless of how it points, our direction changes with the wind. Only the magician and the offscreen purveyors of the magic have the wherewithal to successfully choose the pattern of their own behavior, and we're riding with the cop, not with any of them.However, regardless of any fault I find with the rationale behind this story, the job done enacting it was excellent. The setting is very self consistent. The people seemed believable, even when the choices they made seemed clichéd. They sold the notion to me that ""It's a cliché because human nature continues to be the same.""",Anon
