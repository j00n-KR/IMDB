0,bkoganbing,HAL Comes To Washington,7,21 October 2008,"Shia LaBoeuf plays two parts in Eagle Eye, very briefly he's a young Air Force Man working at a very top secret room on the 36th sub level of the Pentagon basement. He gets killed in a traffic accident and the scene shifts now to his underachieving twin brother who works at a copy store.After the funeral of the Air Force Shia, strange things happen to copy boy Shia. He gets 3/4 of a million dollars in his bank account and his apartment gets filled with all kinds of things that make him look like terrorist suspect number one in the USA. At the same time a young mother, Michelle Monaghan gets some threatening phone calls about bodily harm happening to her son. The two of them, total strangers, get forced to work together on some convoluted scheme.What Air Force Shia was working on is a Hal like computer which monitors everything and knows everything about anyone. The latest in technology in the war on terror. And this HAL like creature named ARIA does not like to be told 'no'. Like HAL, ARIA has decided to dispense with the human element of running our government.Stephen Spielberg produced and D.J. Caruso directed a nice cast of players supporting LaBoeuf and Monaghan. Shia is certainly shedding his Disney Channel image from his Even Stevens days. Best in the supporting cast is Air Force Intelligence Officer Rosario Dawson, formerly B'Elanna Torres on Star Trek Voyager.If this is our future, God Help Us unless we're in the process of creating God with silicon.",Eagle Eye
1,Leofwine_draca,"Dumb, noisy OTT nonsense",3,1 August 2011,"EAGLE EYE has the makings of a decent film. It has a big budget, some of Hollywood's most interesting names (aside from Shia LaBeouf, an actor I'm ambivalent to at best) and a story which has all the trappings of a strong, edge-of-the-seat. A shame, then, that it blows it all in the kind of nonsensical, over-the-top action sequences that belong in a film like TRANSFORMERS instead of a supposedly believable based-in-reality thriller.D. J. Caruso previously directed LaBeouf in DISTURBIA, a fun if undistinguished riff on Hitchcock's REAR WINDOW, remade for the teen crowd. He has his eyes on a wider canvas here, delivering a chase-focused story that takes place throughout the US. There's a solid mystery aspect to the script to begin with, before it transpires that this is nothing more than a spin on the same kind of story we've previously seen in the likes of the TERMINATOR series. There was a wobble in my enjoyment during an indulgent kid's-fantasy scenario involving out-of-control cranes tossing cars around like Matchbox toys, and then the whole suspension-of-disbelief thing is blown to pieces by a scene in which a guy is killed by falling power cables. That kind of scene is an example of extremely lazy writing, and something that just wouldn't happen even within the film's own logic and universe.From this point in, the film lost me. LaBeouf's character was dull, and Michelle Monaghan – who's previously shone in supporting roles in the likes of MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III – seems to play a character with no real point in the story. Others, like Rosario Dawson and Michael Chiklis, are completely wasted. Only Billy Bob Thornton gets a chance to act, but even the role he plays is cliché and dull with little interest behind it. By the time of the umpteenth plane attack, explosion, car chase and CGI-reliant action scene I was seriously bored, and only too glad when the predictable ending arrived.",Eagle Eye
2,SnoopyStyle,Good action as long as nobody thinks too hard,6,12 April 2014,"Jerry Shaw (Shia LaBeouf) is a slacker underachiever. His twin brother dies. Then strange things start happening like a fortune in his bank account, massive amounts of weapons in his apartment, a phone call telling him to leave before the police, and the FBI crashing into his home. Jerry is arrested by Agent Thomas Morgan (Billy Bob Thornton). Rachel Holloman (Michelle Monaghan) is a single mom. A phone call gives her instructions threatening to kill her son. Meanwhile the phone calls keep coming guiding the pair to some unknown objective.There is some good action going on, and a whole lot of outrageous insanity. It struggles between realism and paranoid fantasy. The movie aims to go so fast with so much action that the audience doesn't have time to think about logic or reason. Then it gets even more complicated and it's too much. It seems like a simple story would be so much better. The movie kept going and going. At some point in the last half hour, the movie needs to end. It's just got too much.",Eagle Eye
3,Prismark10,She's out of control,4,5 June 2015,"Eagle Eye is a high tech concept thriller. Shia LaBeouf finds out that his identical twin brother has died. After the funeral he discovers money has been deposited in his account, bomb making material in his apartment and a mysterious woman phones him that the police are on their way to arrest him.Michelle Monaghan plays a single mom whose son is off to play a concert in Washington also receives a phone call from the same woman and she is also coerced to follow instructions or her son will be killed.The film is a preposterous techno thriller of a military supercomputer out of control which can dominate things not even on the grid including power lines (although technically that is on the grid!)Eagle Eye was at one time slated to be directed by Steven Spielberg and is inspired by an Isaac Asimov story. I guess Spielberg felt that the screenplay was never going to meet with his standards. Director DJ Caruso keeps at the film moving at a frenetic place so you never realise how implausible the film is. However there is little chemistry between Monaghan and LaBeouf and you get a feeling that many good actors are wasted.",Eagle Eye
4,kosmasp,Stop (actually don't stop),6,5 October 2010,"This is one of those movies, where if you even started to think about it, you would loose your mind to all the plot holes and all the irregularities in it. But is that what the movie set out to do? No it set out to entertain. So why not sit back and relax and enjoy the ""ride"" with it as long as you can? I hope you can do that and the beginning of the movie is pretty strong. And it stays strong, with a pace that makes Speed look like a turtle/snake in comparison to this Porsche/Ferrari. But again, it begins to fall off, just as the first thought comes into your mind. Everything falls apart. Again this shouldn't bother you too much, if you are out to have a good time and watch a movie and sit back and relax. And I almost could enjoy it more, but towards the end, it just got completely crazy. Something I couldn't completely bare with ... still a decent and in terms of entertainment maybe even great film for some!",Eagle Eye
5,lee_eisenberg,HAL's next step,7,1 January 2009,"I suspect that the total control of society depicted in ""Eagle Eye"" is nothing compared to real life. The movie actually comes out a little better than I expected it to be. It focuses on two people who start getting telephone calls from an unidentified source telling them what to do or face drastic consequences, and helping them along every step of the way.As one might predict, the movie's weaknesses are the excessive - and totally improbable - action sequences. But the movie does a good job looking at the risks that our society has created with its reliance on technology. Granted, it's not in the same league as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". Probably worth seeing once. It appears that D.J. Caruso likes casting Shia LeBoeuf in quasi-remakes of masterpieces (he previously cast LeBoeuf in ""Disturbia"", which had a plot similar to the one in ""Rear Window"").Also starring Michelle Monaghan, Billy Bob Thornton and the voice of Julianne Moore.",Eagle Eye
6,jboothmillard,Eagle Eye,8,27 July 2011,"I saw this reviewed on Film 2008 with Jonathan Ross, it was given quite a mixed review, however the written reviews by critics gave it good marks, I was going to watch whichever opinion I'd agree with after, from director D.J. Caruso (Taking Lives, Disturbia). Basically there have been terrorist attacks on the United States, but there is a big mission aborted by the recommendation of the Department of Defense, and the agreement by Defense Secretary Callister (Fantastic Four's Michael Chiklis), US citizens are caught in the backfire. There is also a big plan for all mobile phones and battery or electricity run appliances and gadgets will be bugged, to hear and see everything someone does. Standford University dropout Jerry Shaw (Shia LaBeouf) has recently suffered the death of his twin brother from an accident, he achieved much more, and soon afterwards strange things start to happen. Starting with a huge cash sum appearing in Jerry's bank account, some high technology weapons delivered to his home, and then receiving a phone call from an unknown voice ordering him to get out and follow instructions. Also contacted by this anonymous voice is single mother Rachel Holloman (Source Code's Michelle Monaghan), soon enough she and Jerry are brought together to travel together as they are told the police are after them. They are warned that if they do not follow the instructions given by this voice, later revealed for being someone involved with the organisation and technological system called Eagle Eye, that people or things they care about will be targeted, in Rachel's case it's obviously her son. Meanwhile, chasing after them are the FBI led by Special Agent Thomas Morgan (Billy Bob Thornton), with investigation and stuff from Air Force Office of Special Investigations Special Agent Zoe Pérez (Rosario Dawson), but Eagle Eye are doing everything to stop them interfering. They are to see and hear essentially everything that Jerry and Rachel are doing, but they are also able to control things to help them on their way, e.g. traffic lights, buses, security doors, airport luggage transportation shoots, etc. Of course eventually we find out that Eagle is a large computerised system, and they are the enemy as they plan to detonate a bomb, hidden in the instrument of Rachel's son, set to activate on a particular note, and kill the President. In the end Jerry and Rachel manage to get to the place where the President will be speaking, stop the bomb from exploding, and Pérez with her colleague meanwhile seems to destroy the supercomputer. Also starring Anthony Mackie as Major William Bowman, Ethan Embry as Agent Toby Grant, Anthony Azizi as Ranim Khalid, William Sadler as Jerry's Dad and Deborah Strang as Jerry's Mom. LaBeouf gives a good panicky and racing performance, Monaghan does well as the worrying single mother, and Thornton is really good as the man trying to track them down. I will be honest and say that I did not understand all the reasons for what was going on, but the big reason I enjoyed this film was for the high octane chases, filled with explosions, near-misses and technology to add speed, an exciting action thriller. Very good!",Eagle Eye
7,rmax304823,Interesting Premise -- Kneecapped.,5,9 March 2016,"An engaging premise. You know the little voice that gives you driving directions from your GPS in the car? ""Turn left in two hundred yards."" ""Approaching destination."" Well, imagine that the little voice controls all the electronically transmitted orders to automated devices. I know it sounds terrifying but it needn't be all that bad. In this flick, Shia LaBeouf is astounded when his ATM shows a deposit of three quarters of a million dollars and spews it out into his hands and all over the Chicago sidewalk.Naturally, the beneficence of the little voice is an illusion, because its ends are to enable terrorists to take over the world, or destroy a city, or force everyone to listen to twelve-tone music, or something. The design is to force LaBeouf and his accomplice, Michelle Monaghan, to see that the terrorists get hold of a new explosive, so powerful that a chunk the size of a pinhead will -- I don't know, do things that are just plain distasteful. It enlists LaBeouf and Monaghan by saying in a cheerful voice through whatever device is available -- a cell phone, a traffic sign -- things like, ""You have four seconds to exit the car before your baby is decapitated."" That's what I call an imaginative premise and great things could have been done with it. But great things aren't done with it. It deteriorates in a few minutes into another novating action movie. The first high speed car chase takes place twenty minutes into the film. It seems to last forever. Never in the history of civilization has there been so much destruction wrought upon cars. They don't merely bump into one another, as at an amusement park, but they roll over ten times and disintegrate into thin slabs of metal mixed with mechanical junk. Cars are squashed by masses of scrap iron. They're picked up by automated cranes and dropped into Lake Michigan. The writers must hate cars.The human characters have far more endurance. They're practically superhuman. LaBeouf leaps out of a ten-story window, bounces off a tin roof far below, and lands on an I-beam over the subway tracks, and there's not a bruise on him. He's not even out of breath. And when he and Monaghan fling themselves into a mass of polluted water, we see them the next morning, and they look better than you and I do the next morning. After the dunking, the splashing, the swimming, the crawling out onto the mud, the hauling of themselves up onto the dock, Monaghan's hair is perfectly groomed. Her false eyelashes have stayed with her loyally throughout the ordeal.I couldn't watch the whole mess. I mean, there's a limit. Whatever happened to good solid Hollywood movies? Where did it all go?

8,Tweekums,Silly but exciting,7,19 April 2018,"Shortly after the death of his twin brother things start going wrong for Jerry Shaw in a rather strange way. First he gets home and finds his apartment full of weapons; moments later he gets a call for a woman telling him that he is about to be arrested, which he is. When he uses his 'one phone call' he finds himself talking to her again and she gives him instructions to escape. Meanwhile Rachel Holloman also receives a call telling her that her son's train will derail if she doesn't do as she is told. Soon she is united with Jerry and the two are forced to undertake a mission which will take them to the country's centres of power. As they travel they wonder about the woman guiding them; she appears to be able to access anything computerised; phones, traffic lights, all CCTV and even the cranes at a junk yard.It must be said that the plot of this film is rather silly and I'm sure most viewers will have an idea about the identity of the voice directing Jerry and Rachel long before the characters work it out. These details aren't much of a problem as the action moves along at a cracking pace with lots of exciting action from start to finish. This includes car chases with numerous crashes, a chase through an airport baggage handling area and excitement under the Pentagon and in the US Capitol building. Shia LaBeouf and Michelle Monaghan are solid as Jerry and Rachel; there are also impressive performances from Billy Bob Thornton and Rosario Dawson as the FBI Agent and USAF investigator looking for them. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody looking for some fairly inoffensive brain-in-neutral action; if you are looking for something deep and meaningful look elsewhere.",Eagle Eye
9,BA_Harrison,A preposterous yet fun high-tech thriller.,7,15 September 2013,"A top secret government surveillance computer controls the lives of slacker Jerry Shaw (Shia LaBeouf) and single mum Rachel Holloman (Michelle Monaghan) with the ultimate aim of killing the President and his administration, whom she (yes, the computer is a female) holds responsible for a recent spate of terrorist attacks on the US.Calling Eagle Eye far-fetched doesn't really cut it: it has one of the most preposterous, highly unbelievable and convoluted plots that I think I've ever seen in a thriller. To list every ridiculous twist and turn in this film would take me all day, suffice to say that throughout the course of the action, the computer puts its human puppets through numerous life-threatening situations where death would be the most likely outcome, thereby risking putting an untimely end to 'her' plan.Of course, Jerry and Rachel somehow survive every crash, explosion and gun battle unscathed (at least until the final scene), thus allowing the film to continue though almost two hours of over-the-top Hollywood action the likes of which really needs to be seen to be believed: a building is crushed by a crane, computer controlled junkyard machines attack speeding cars, our heroes are involved in a gunfight on the conveyor belts of an airport baggage area, and a military drone flies into a tunnel to blow up traffic.The funny thing is, as easy as it is to criticise Eagle Eye for its unrelenting absurdity, I have to admit that I still had quite a bit of fun with the film: LaBeouf and Monaghan put in solid performances; Billy Bob Thornton is great as FBI Agent Thomas Morgan; director D.J. Caruso handles the chaos confidently, largely avoiding the use of rapid-fire editing and irritating visual gimmicks; and the special effects work is excellent, with a spectacular articulated truck crash being my highlight of the whole crazy affair. It might be a lot to ask of the viewer, but successfully suspend disbelief, and this can be a surprisingly entertaining popcorn cyber-thriller.6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 just for having the cojonas to make something so blatantly silly and over-the-top in the first place.",Eagle Eye
10,moonspinner55,Smash! Crash! and Shattered Glass...,5,27 September 2008,"The twin brother of a now-deceased government operative has his mundane life thrown into turmoil after being set up to look like a terrorist by an all-knowing super-computer (think a sex-reversal of ""2001""'s HAL); its agenda is to have the young man flee towards Washington, D.C. to complete an insanely complicated assassination plot on Capitol Hill. Car chase-and-crash mayhem, directed for maximum thrill-ride impact, rushes along at a breakneck pace at the expense of logic (this is a film without even the smallest semblance of logic or accountability). Director D.J. Caruso doesn't stop to answer questions, and some may see that as a wise move (common sense would surely deflate this entire scenario, and most audiences may not even want the plot ironed out). Strictly on its action-adventure terms, this high-tech, ultra-commercial movie has incredible energy and visual flair, and the four screenwriters credited do come up with some amusingly jaded repartee between hijacked strangers Shia LaBeouf and Michelle Monaghan. Unfortunately, the entire whiplash journey becomes nothing short of a hoax on our two heroes, who might have been left expendable were it not for that happy final tag. Adrenaline-filled, non-think entertainment for indiscriminate fans of modern military and counter-intelligence thrillers, though some viewers may end up feeling just as used as the participants. ** from ****",Eagle Eye
11,blanche-2,Derivative but highly entertaining,8,18 May 2013,"I've reviewed many action films on this site, and I always say the same thing. What I say goes double for ""Eagle Eye."" Don't try and analyze these films. Just go with them and enjoy the action and suspense.""Eagle Eye"" from 2008 stars Shia LaBeouf, Michelle Monaghan, Billy Bob Thornton, Rosario Dawson, Anthony Mackie, and Michael Chiklis. LaBoeuf is Jerry, whose twin brother has just died in a car accident. Suddenly Jerry has $750,000 in his bank account and when he arrives back at his place, he has boxes and boxes of weapons. Then he gets a call on his cell phone and a woman's voice tells him to get out; the FBI are coming. Jerry soon learns that if he doesn't listen to this woman, he gets into big trouble.A similar thing happens to a single mom, Rachel, who has just put her son on a train to Washington D.C., where his school orchestra will play at the State of the Union address. She gets a cell phone call - same woman - and if she doesn't do what she's told, which is help Jerry, her son will be killed.""Eagle Eye"" is a derivative story that goes back to 2001: A Space Odyssey and Hal, as a super computer named Aria starts calling the shots.This film has car chases, explosions, plane chases, and murders in abundance. I can promise you, you won't be bored. The film moves at warp speed.The acting is very good, with Michael Chiklis a standout as the Secretary of State. Billy Bob Thornton, LaBeouf, Monaghan, Dawson, and Mackie are all excellent as well, but Chiklis gives the movie some gravitas, which it needs.However, you won't be able to overlook a few problems. One is that $750,000 in Jerry's account. Now, anyone who has ever been to an ATM knows that there's a maximum amount you can withdraw. And that maximum amount isn't $750,000 - I doubt most ATMs have $100,000 bills, which were printed, I believe, only once. All this money spits out - and it couldn't have been in thousands as there weren't enough of them. That right there should give you a clue that we have moved into another reality. Just try and enjoy it.Sadly I think this film has a kernel of truth -- I do believe that the government is able to do a great deal of what is done in this film. And it's pretty scary. What Chiklis says at the end of the film is true, that in protecting liberty we very often take much of it away from citizens. Try not to dwell on that either.",Eagle Eye
12,michaelRokeefe,High-octane thriller.,8,10 January 2009,"Sit back and hold on. Don't expect too many chances to relax.

13,sunwarrior13,An Entertaining Techno-Thriller,9,25 September 2012,"Eagle Eye is a techno-thriller film that features Shia LaBeouf and Michelle Monaghan. The two portray a young man and a single mother who are brought together and coerced by an anonymous caller into carrying out a plan by a possible terrorist organization. Billy Bob Thornton, Rosario Dawson, Michael Chiklis,Julianne Moore and Anthony Mackie co- star.It was directed by D.J. Caruso.Jerry Shaw and Rachel Holloman were complete strangers at the beginning of the day, but that changed the instant a strange woman called to threaten both their lives and the lives of their loved ones. Suddenly forced into a series of increasingly dangerous situations, they must now take orders from a woman who's using everyday technology to track and control their every move. As the situation intensifies and the hapless duo are deemed the country's most wanted fugitives, they must work together in order to discover who it was that turned their lives upside down, and what they can do to thwart the criminal mastermind's cunning yet diabolical plan.This film is a totally derivative, unoriginal techno-thriller, cribbing scenes and ideas from better films.This ""cell phone thriller"" is frankly preposterous but compulsively watchable as it puts the male main character in a mess of trouble instigated by a mysterious telephone voice. Also being blackmailed is a single mom (Michelle Monaghan) receiving similar phone calls. Why are they being jerked around by the purring female voice, and why is the road leading to Washington, D.C.? Actually, you won't have time to contemplate these questions, because the director keeps the action going at the customary breakneck pace. This is a wise move, because the real questions you'd likely be asking have to do with the plausibility of events on a minute-by-minute basis and it keeps the audience entertained.",Eagle Eye
14,hitchcockthelegend,A timely reminder of what makes action/thriller movies fun.,8,27 October 2008,"Jerry and Rachel are two strangers thrust together by a series of scenarios put together by a mysterious female caller. Under threat to their families and themselves, both Jerry & Rachel must overcome the most hazardous of situations. Intriguingly everything around them seems to be controlled by the female voice that guides them, but just why is the FBI so hot on their tail?, does Jerry's twin brother hold the key?. All will be answered as our protagonists hurtle towards something that may have deadly consequences for America.Big Brother gets a reboot and delivers as fun a genre picture as was released in 2008. Yes it's total nonsense, but really the critics venting spleen on this one must have gone through a popcorn entertainment bypass prior to viewing it. Director D.J. Caruso continues his Hitckcockian leanings by following his surprisingly fun ""Disturbia"" with this ""North By Northwest"" type concept that meets a host of the genre staples, where the influences are very hard to miss. Yet as daft as it is, and it is folks, ""Eagle Eye"" knits well together to play out as a highly accomplished piece, the action is first rate, in fact on big screens the two main sequences explode with joyous action abandon. This isn't found wanting on the thriller front either, it's safe to say that no new ground is to be found as we get to the tick tock countdown finale, but Caruso, and writers John Glenn & Travis Wright, have spliced together a series of wholly interesting and thrilling strands. So much so that the finale is disappointingly unable to quite deliver on the promise of the prior build up.Shia LaBeouf seemed destined to be a young actor who had to earn even the smallest bit of respect, where much like DiCaprio at the time, you felt LaBeouf was likely to get better notices later in his career. After being sidekicks to John McLaine, Indiana Jones, and erm, Optimus Prime, LaBeouf here earned his acting spurs and carries the film with a charm and credibility that the daftness of the piece doesn't quite deserve. Shia is helped enormously by a strong female lead, Michelle Monaghan has an impressive ability to sweat strength whilst channelling believable emotional turmoil, and her interplay with LaBeouf is the heartbeat of the picture. Of the rest, Michael Chiklis is a bit underused, but this is offset by Billy Bob Thornton continuing that knack of being one of the most watchable actors of his generation. Rosario Dawson is sadly weak in this and William Sadler is barely noticeable, conversely though a nod of approval goes to Anthony Mackie who shines in a crucial sequence towards the end.My first viewing was when I went to the cinema with the then two ladies in my life, we were a bit early and sat in the foyer for a while, we watched as they were queuing out the door for ""High School Musical 3"" and weird looking people were trundling in to see ""Saw 5"". There were a total of 12 people in the cinema to see ""Eagle Eye"" on its second week run, at a peak viewing time as well. That was a damn shame because ""Eagle Eye"" may well be a dumb and fun action/thriller picture, but it's not pro-porting to be anything else, and really film's with honest entertainment intent are to be treasured and used for why they are made for in the first place. ""Eagle Eye"" is made for those who want to shut off from the world for a couple of hours, and in doing so have an energised blast in the process. 7.5/10",Eagle Eye

""Eagle Eye"" has enough for even the most discriminating fan of the thriller genre to last him for a while. The director, D.J. Caruso has created a story that keeps the viewer guessing what's next. The action never stops and by the end we feel exhausted by all we have witnessed. Credit must go to the editor, Jim Page, for putting together the amazing footage that involves the destruction of almost everything imaginable, or otherwise. Darius Wolski's cinematography show us a black world in which the characters move. Bryan Tyler's musical score is appropriate for what the creators wanted to present.Shia Labeouf, an intense young actor keeps reminding us of a young John Cusak.

This is an okay action film if, IF you don't think about it. I had suspicions it wasn't going to make a whole hell of a lot of sense from the trailer but I went along with it anyway until Shia LaBeouf's character comes home and finds it stacked with so much explosives and military gear that there was no way it could have gotten in to the apartment. The rest of the film consists of some very good action set pieces but very little in the way of logical plotting. Its one of the stupidest movies of the year, even if its really well made.

19,zardoz-13,A Runaway Roller-coaster of a Romantic Action Thriller!,8,27 September 2008,"The Steven Spielberg produced political suspense saga ""Eagle Eye"" careens recklessly like a runaway train throughout most of its 118 minutes. This sinister romantic action thriller about two ordinary people that stumble into the middle of a presidential assassination plot with 'Big Brother' surveillance technology monitoring their every move is predictable but exciting pabulum. Perfect strangers Shia LaBeouf and Michelle Monaghan collide quite by coincidence in a frenzy of complicated intrigue as well as non-stop action and find themselves racing against time to elude not only the FBI but also Military Intelligence so they can save America from its own cyberspace anti-terrorism defenses.Nothing about this exhilarating epic is remotely believable. Moreover, you've seen enough of these paranoid, nail-biting thrillers by now to have a good idea what our heroes are pitted against. LaBeouf makes a rough-around-the-edges hero, while pretty Monaghan qualifies as the traditional woman-in-jeopardy who doesn't make a complete jackass of herself. As hopelessly derivative as ""Eagle Eye"" is, ""Disturbia"" director D.J. Caruso knows enough to pile every preposterous plot turn atop another like a forty car pile-up on a busy interstate.The combined charisma of LaBeouf & Monahgan, with affable wattage from co-stars Billy Bob Thornton and Rosario Dawson, as well as its high-octane action scenes, helter-skelter spontaneity, and breathless momentum enables ""Eagle Eye"" to offset its hackneyed Hitchcockian thriller plots. The real drawback of ""Eagle Eye"" is its lack of a genuine flesh & blood villain; evil machinesa staple of paranoid science fiction fablesare the villains.Remember the Stanley Kubrick classic ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968) where the computer running the space ship went berserk and overrode human command. In one scene, the computer's camera read the lips of the astronauts that wanted to put it out of commission. The computer managed to kill one of them. Not only does ""Eagle Eye"" draw its inspiration from that scene in ""2001,"" but also from a minor classic ""Colossus: The Forbin Project"" (1970) where evil, amok computers conspired against mankind to destroy civilization. Moreover, ""Eagle Eye"" pays homage to Tony Scott's paranoid chiller ""Enemy of the State"" with Will Smith about the electronic technology that allows our government to monitor every aspect of our lives. Indeed, ""Eagle Eye"" qualifies as the first truly supercharged 21st century exploration of ""1984"" government intrusion into our private lives.Like every Alfred Hitchcock thriller about an everyday guy drawn into the vortex of a conspiracy, Shia LaBeouf fits the description. In a sense, his character is reminiscent of ""Wanted"" protagonist Wesley Allan Gibson who found himself in another world of assassins and death. As Jerry Shaw, LaBeouf works at a franchise copier store as a menial clerk, and he has trouble paying his rent on time. His marginal existence plunges him into oblivion almost immediately when he learns about the death of his twin brother, Ethan (LaBeouf in a dual role), a decorated U.S.A.F. Officer. Meanwhile, things aren't faring any better for Rachel . She has to pack her son Sam (Cameron Boyce) off on a train trip to a concert, and Sam's father infuriates her by arriving at the last minute to bid his son farewell. Rachel (Michelle Monaghan of ""Constantine"") receives a cell phone call that her son will die if she doesn't follow without question the orders of an anonymous voice.At the same time, Jerry comes home to find his apartment stacked with an arsenal of illegal materials that every terrorist dreams they could have at their disposal. Moments before helmet-clad, machine gun-armed FBI agents barge into his apartment, Jerry receives a cell call that warns him about the G-men as well as his best means of escape. An incredulous Jerry balks and winds up in an interrogation room facing a skeptical Federal Agent Tom Morgan (Billy Bob Thornton of ""The Astronaut Farmer"") who wants to get to the bottom of all this nonsense. Basically, if ""Eagle Eye"" had been made a decade ago, either Tommy Lee Jones or Morgan Freeman would have been cast in the Morgan role. Smartly dressed Air Force investigator Zoe (Rosario Dawson of ""Kids"") wants to question Jerry, too.The machinery of justice allows Jerry to make his one phone call. Before he knows what is happening the same anonymous voice orders him to hit the floor just moments before a crane smashes into the skyscraper room where he is being held and wipes out two walls. By the time Zoe and Morgan have the door open, our protagonist has flown the coop. When Jerry isn't listening to his cell phone, he receives directions from virtually any electronic device, such as scrolling text LED signs. At the heart of ""Eagle Eye"" is a virtual villain programmed to protect America's security from every possible contingency. This machinethink of the ""Terminator"" franchiseacts to carry out its prime directive and protect itself. The Defense Department houses this massive computer called 'Aria' that was invented to track, spy and calculate domestic terror risks. 'Aria' can take control of the most benign surveillance system and exploit it for its devilish designs.""Eagle Eye"" soars with excitement. Ignore its inconsistencies and its implausible plot and enjoy it for what it isan entertaining popcorn movie.",Eagle Eye

22,neil-476,"Unmitigated tosh, but always watchable",5,23 October 2008,"As the credits rolled, my first reaction was that there was so much wrong with this film that I didn't know where to start. The urban paranoia theme of being unable to escape the all-seeing eye of Big Brother was addressed very effectively in Enemy Of The State with Gene Hackman and Will Smith: one's expectation is that this thriller is going to run along similar lines. However, credibility dissipates as the all-seeing presence displays an ability to control events which, at times, borders on omnipotence. It turns out that there is a reason for this, but that reason results in any remaining credibility evaporating totally. What remains is a series of chases and revelations leading up to a contrived climax.A single example of one of the things which irritated me: a sonic detonator is placed in the bore of a trumpet (when a particular note is played it will detonate an explosive device). We see this item being placed in the trumpet - it fits exactly into the bore of the trumpet. Yet the trumpet player doesn't notice that it's there and continues to be able to play perfectly.Despite being irritated at the implausibility of Eagle Eye (and at the number of films it ripped off - the 2001: A Space Odyssey rip-off is so blatant that one of the characters is actually called Bowman), I quite enjoyed the movie despite myself. The reason for this, I think, is that the main actors - Shia LaBoeuf, Michelle Monaghan, Billy Bob Thornton, Rozario Dawson and Michael Chiklis - all gave performances of commitment which went way beyond the quality of the source material.So it must be stated that the film itself is utter tosh but, if you like these performers, and you don't want anything beyond action sequences and blowing stuff up, then you may well quite enjoy it.",Eagle Eye
23,ferguson-6,2001: A Minority Report Odyssey,5,28 September 2008,"Greetings again from the darkness. Of course, most Sci-Fi movies beg, borrow and steal from others but this one seemed very familiar, just bigger, faster, stronger (get it??? steroids). Director D.J. Caruso, hot off ""Disturbia"" tackles a much bigger budget this time, and delivers non-stop action. In fact, there were so many explosions and crashes, I can't believe neither Michael Bay nor Jerry Bruckheimer were involved.Shia LeBeouf delivers another solid performance. His hyper-frenetic energy serves him well now, but I will be interested to see how he develops as an adult actor. Sharing the screen is the amazing Michelle Monaghan, who delivers another in a growing list of top notch performances. She has amazing screen presence and a wide range of emotion - whether screaming and beating Shia, or crying for her son.Billy Bob Thornton, Michael Chiklis and Rosario Dawson are the support here, but the real star is the computer who takes over itself and sends all of these poor people on a wild ride.While there are so many outrageous moments, I will say, none were more difficult to believe than the 3 minutes it took Michelle to change into a cocktail dress, adorn jewelry and high heels, brush her hair and apply make-up. Anyone know another woman who can match that? Suspension of disbelief is certainly required for this one, but I still have a difficult time getting too excited about a festival of explosions and car crashes ... all of which has been done in numerous movies like Mission Impossible, Die Hard, etc. Listening to Julianne Moore's lifeless voice may have been the best part.",Eagle Eye

Caruso / Cast: Shia LaBeouf, Michelle Monaghan, Rosario Dawson, Billy Bob Thornton, Michael Chiklis: Action packed mess about paranoia, such as those people in the audience who feared that their being in attendance of this film would hurt their reputation. Shia LaBeouf and Michelle Monaghan are forced by unseen forces to do as told or suffer consequences. Technology becomes the enemy as a voice via cell phone and other means prevent them from aborting their orders. Directed by D.J. Caruso with tremendous action scenes but car crashes are marveled as opposed to being suspenseful. Caruso previously made Taking Lives, and also worked with LaBeouf before in the pitiful Disturbia. Apparently nobody thought to send him ominous phone calls telling him to abort this project. LeBeouf arrives at his apartment only to find it packed with guns. A voice on the phone informs him that police are on their way. He escapes and spends the remainder of the film narrowly escaping death. He is joined by Monaghan who will join LaBeouf in his several near death encounters. Her biggest near death experience involves her career and this stupid action film farce. Rosario Dawson and Billy Bob Thornton are a complete waste as two investigators. Totally contrived and manipulating action film with little purpose as far as the eye can see.

26,gradyharp,Fast Paced Thriller with a Sappy Ending,8,1 January 2009,"EAGLE EYE is not a great movie but it is an entertaining one. Granted, leaving reason at the door is a prerequisite to plugging into the plot, but the style of the film and the premise that in the midst of all of our government's supposedly first class intelligence agencies such amazing programs can be staged opens the window for some speculation. Credit writers John Glenn, Travis Wright, Hillary Seitz and Dan McDermott for pushing the button on current cellphone obsession tied to terrorism to an all time high. And with director D.J. Caruso at the helm the whole preposterous (but entertaining) tale comes vividly to life. Jerry Shaw (Shia LaBeouf) is a free-living disappointment to his father and at the funeral of Jerry's twin brother Ethan the tables turn. Somehow Jerry's little apartment is filled with guns and ammo and a mysterious female telephone voice on his cellphone warns him to escape the impending FBI entry. Jerry is clueless as to the appearance of the weaponry and when taken into custody Agent Thomas Morgan (Billy Bob Thornton) accuses him of collusion with his probable terrorist twin brother, now deceased. Jerry escapes but is 'followed' by the constant orders from his cellphone that lead to dangerous circumstances. On the other side of the city a working mother Rachel (Michelle Monaghan) receives equally strange cellphone calls threatening to murder her child if he does not do the voice's bidding. Obviously Jerry and Rachel are joined in this duo adventure and the manner in which they resolve the clues on the run closely pursued by Agent Morgan, Zoe Perez (Rosario Dawson) et al drives the story to its conclusion. The movie is bogged down with far too many car chases and absurd crashes and disasters, but the idea of terrorism in a new guise is an interesting one. But for all the tense mood of the movie, the audience is doused with a syrupy sentimental ending which all but negates the adrenalin flow the film had. LaBeouf and Monaghan make an interesting coupling, given the little dialog they have to create fleshed out characters. Not a great movie, but not a bad movie for thriller fans. Grady Harp",Eagle Eye

When I saw the ending, I thought you had to be joking. Lame! Just not lame but super lame. The movie's ebb and flow is a 6 out of 10. I would never buy the movie , but I would rent it. Go to the cheap theater to see Eagle Eye. A date movie where you are more interested in your date than the movie. My wife enjoyed the movie. I guess she didn't see the movie 2001.

I think the world would be in big trouble as computer have no grey areas.",Eagle Eye
28,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Eagle Eye,7,1 October 2008,"From one cellphone-centric movie in Connected another with Eagle Eye, this movie dwells on the fears of man about the abuse of technology, given how pervasive a simple device like the mobile phone, could be a haven for anyone tapped into the network to triangulate your whereabouts. Some other fears get presented, such as activating the microphone within without your knowledge, eavesdropping on your conversation whether or not you're on the phone. Big Brother heaven, but ordinary citizen's nightmare.Granted the proper use of technology, which in the first 10 minutes of the film, we got a glimpse at the possibilities which, if not already is, the future of such usage. Gone are the eyes in the skies, now replaced with eyes from outer space and connected to one another through intelligent networks ripe for the abusive picking. While the terrorism buzzword has been bandied around in a number of movies for some time already, I can't recall off the top of my head any cyber-terrorism movie worth your while, until perhaps now.It's a different approach to the subject actually, and to say anything more would be to let the cat out of the bag. But it does make one sit back and think about contingencies, backups, and just how much human intervention in the form of checks and balances that need to be in place to justify the existence and reliance on intelligent algorithms. In a way the movie doesn't break new ground, in that the chief villain here (barring the arrogance of man) is nothing not seen before, and the manner it was dispatched, well, a matter of cinematic convenience.Directed by D.J. Caruso (who also helmed the Shia LaBeouf vehicle Disturbia), Eagle Eye follows the three narrative thread formula which has concurrent events developing at the same time at frantic pace, leaving you with not much room to breathe as you can presented with facts, figures and arguments, coupled with constant probing of just what exactly is going on. We follow Jerry Shaw (Shia LaBeouf) and Rachel Holloman (Michelle Monaghan), two ordinary citizens who through the picking up of a random phonecall, they become slaves to do the bidding of the monotone voice at the other side of the line. At risk is Jerry's escape from the law, having being framed for being a terrorist, while Rachel has her son dangled in front of her as collateral.There's something not quite right with the two of them running around doing seemingly menial tasks, to the more dangerous stunts like robbing an armoured truck, which leads to the other two threads, involving Billy Bob Thorton's FBI Agent Thomas Morgan, and Rosario Dawson's Zoe Perez as an Air Force investigator being called up to the Pentagon where we slowly learn what could actually have gone wrong.Hollywood ""It"" boy LaBeouf continues his string of box office successes (Eagle Eye opened at #1 at the US box office) and has made clueless, carefree teenagers his forte. Here, with the assistance of some overnight shadow around his chin, he brings on certain gravitas and maturity to what is essentially a Keanu-Reeves type character. Michelle Monaghan gets a boost in the action-thriller genre from her stint under Tom Cruise's Mission Impossible: III, and doesn't look a bit out of place here as a mother willing to go to extreme lengths to ensure the safety of her son.The supporting cast though were a little wasted. Rosario Dawson's role didn't require her to do anything other than to look sharp in uniform, while Billy Bob was just plain Billy Bob. Action sequences were a little hit and miss, going back to basics with yet another tussle in a tunnel with big bang explosions, to the more innovative literally blink-and-you-miss moment involving huge electric cables, or having a field day within baggage handling.Eagle Eye is a surprisingly taut action thriller that held your attention just right until about when it showed hand and revealed its source code, then it's treading of familiar territory thereafter. Held great potential in having you guess just what and how things are done the way they were, until you realize its bluff, and then it's just your usual through passage to the finale, with a cop out to boot too.",Eagle Eye
29,Smells_Like_Cheese,I thought it was kind of stupid... sorry?,4,10 October 2008,"Eagle Eye's trailer was one of the coolest trailers that I had seen in a little while, so I was looking forward to seeing it. I work at a movie theater and a lot of people were walking out very happy, so I had high hopes, so I saw it a couple of weeks ago, I don't know, it's very strange because it seems like after I saw it and didn't like it, the audience didn't like it either. The rating however here on IMDb continued to rise, so I wanted to think this movie over, but seriously, I'm still not crazy over Eagle Eye. My problem with it is that it's dumb, it's just a silly story line, there's a good unrealistic and there's a bad unrealistic, this is a bad unrealistic. Not to mention that I thought it was unoriginal with the ""technology will destroy us all"" story line, if you are going to use this story line once again, I suggest making it worth my time.Jerry Shaw is a young man who is kind of a bum, he really needs to get his life together, just needs a little determination. Well he might get that when he receives a phone call from a mysterious lady who is telling him to get out of his weapon stuffed apartment and that the FBI are about to bust in, he fails and is arrested. Later we meet a young woman who is also a mother, Rachel, and the same lady calls her threatening her son if she doesn't follow the rules. Jerry escapes and finds Rachel, together they are ordered around town to get a bomb for this voice that can alter any cell phone, computer, even signs on the sides of the building, or there will be horrible consequences. Agent Morgan is chasing after these two having to realize maybe there's more to this than just Jerry and Rachel running from the law.Eagle Eye does truly deliver on the action, as much as I hate to say it, this car chase scene in the movie is very exciting and should be watched on the big screen. There are some other very tense and fun moments, but great action doesn't make a great movie. I also felt like Michelle Monaghan is miscast, somehow this woman who looks like she could be no older than 25 years old is playing a mom, it was just odd to take her as this character. Then they place a strange love story between her and Shia and it just throws the movie off completely. I would say if you're going to spend money on it, do a matinée, otherwise, I'd say skip it, to me at least this was just an over blown movie that could have been toned down just a smidge.4/10",Eagle Eye

We soon learn, the voice is from a computer developed by the army to track terrorists. The army goes against the computer's advice, so the computer determines that the US government is the top enemy. The only interesting thing in the plot is the reason the computer needs Jerry to complete its goal. It has something to do with the fact he was a twin.Billy Bob Thorton is in this playing the role that usually goes to Tommy Lee Jones. None of the actors are given much to work with. And Rosario Dawson is completely miscast.

I have read many negative reviews and most of the reviewers assume that this is supposed to be an Oscar-worthy movie. It's not. I also read that people have fallen asleep. That's impossible watching this film. There is plenty of action and suspense.This story is about Jerry Shaw. After his twin bro died, he receives crates of bombs and guns and 750,000 dollars. He gets a call from a mysterious woman that the FBI will be arriving. Eventually, he escapes and meets with a young woman who received a call from the same stranger saying that her son will die unless she obeys the voice. Now both people are on the run from the FBI for acts of terrorism.Shia LaBeouf is maturing as a fine action hero. I enjoyed his movies such as Transformers and the last Indiana Jones. Michelle Monaghan did a pretty good job. I am pleasantly surprised to find Billy Bob Thornton playing the FBI agent. He did excellent. Michael Chiklis did great but he deserves more screen time.This movie is full of suspense. I never knew what would happen after Jerry Shaw got the money and guns for no reason whatsoever. There are some good action scenes, too.Overall, this is a fine film. You will like this if you think that this movie is not going to win an Oscar. I rate this film 10/10.",Eagle Eye

The two-thirds of the movie was unbelievably frustratingly impossible plausibility of what was happening or even worse how the heroes somehow even survive into the second half of the movie. The movie has some suspense, jiggly camera work that attempts to make the action look cool but doesn't. There are a few dialogue gems, bits of humor as well as some decent plot scenes but they can't substitute for a consistent, entertaining movie experience. By the last third of the movie when the action and tension begin to come together with some decency, the typical American ending comes home in style deflating the emotional impact of the finale.

36,sol-,Activated,6,5 January 2017,"Told that they have been ""activated"" by a mysterious female voice on the phone, two strangers find themselves on the run from the authorities, aided and abetted by the voice who seems to be able to control all machinery and electronic devices at will. Powered by such an intriguing premise, the first half of 'Eagle Eye' is utterly encapsulating. Not only are the elusive true motives of the voice subject for thought, so is the extent of her ability to control electronics and the question of whether others are involved. A surprise science fiction twist around halfway in, however, spins the material in a new direction and while the ideas are still interesting, the second section owes so much to earlier films like 'WarGames' and 'I, Robot' that it is sometimes hard to avoid it feeling like a pale imitation. The two halves of the film are not, however, quite as distinctive as they might sound. Throughout there is a running agenda of government surveillance and over-reliance on technology and while the film plays more on fears about this (and less the potential of it), it is food for thought all the same. Regardless of what one thinks of the themes and ideas though, 'Eagle Eye' is undeniably thrilling ride. Whereas director D.J. Caruso's previous film, 'Disturbia', was essentially an updating of 'Rear Window', this effort is similarly molded on Hitchcockian wrong man thrillers. The violence is a lot more extreme, but the dynamic remains the same with the everyman protagonists eventually proving themselves capable of everything they are mistaken as trying to do.",Eagle Eye
37,zkonedog,"Too Much Action, Too Little Acting",4,12 March 2017,"The film Eagle Eye advertised itself as an action/adventure film with an aspect of government intrigue (""Big Brother is watching""). While the film definitely delivers in the action department, there really isn't much else to it.The basic plot of the film centers on two ordinary people who are suddenly ""activated"" as terrorists and must flee for there lives while only taking messages from all the electronic devices around them (cell phones, billboards, streaming text lines, LED signs, etc.). As they continue to flee, they eventually figure out what is happening to them and begin hatching a plan to stop it.The reason why this movie fails, though, is that is doesn't focuses on the dramatic elements that are actually interesting. Without giving any spoilers, the film would have been much better served focusing on two areas: 1. The technology behind why the two U.S. citizens are ""activated"" in the first place; and 2. The relationship between the two lead characters played by Shia LaBeouf and Michelle Monaghan.Instead, however, this film is little more than one pulse-pounding action sequence after another with just enough (but much too little) exposition to move the plot forward to the next crazy chase scene. Plus, the focus of the film seemed to be on the fact that the two citizens can be communicated with or found by any electronic device. However, it covered much of the same territory that Will Smith and Gene Hackman did in Enemy of the State a decade ago. There wasn't enough new material to really hook me into this plot thread.Thus, if you a huge fan of non-stop action in films, you will love this film. If you need some character and plot development to keep your interest, though, then skip this movie, as you will just be disappointed.",Eagle Eye
38,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Gratuitous action thriller,5,9 August 2009,"I get it. If we're not careful, our excessive use of technology will destroy our privacy and ultimately be our demise. Now that ""Eagle Eye"" has completely emptied the tank on the concept of cell phones and surveillance cameras being used to create an elaborate conspiracy, maybe we can go back to character-driven thrillers.No knocks on the entertainment factor of ""Eagle Eye."" Produced by Steven Spielberg along with a couple of the writers behind ""Transformers,"" (real shocker there) this an exceptionally well-paced action thriller that has us hooked and begging for answers as to what's happening to Jerry (LaBeouf), who finds himself framed for terrorist-related activities and being commanded to do things by a woman on his cell phone who appears to have access to anything that can be programmed.The problem with ""Eagle Eye,"" minus its tired concept, is that as it keeps barreling along on the railways and streets of Chicago, it only becomes less interesting and more outlandish. Unlike most thrillers that tend to get more exciting as a film goes on, ""Eagle Eye"" actually gets worse as we know more and more about the reason behind everything, making it really hard to critique without spoilers. We're still engaged, but we find more and more reasons to role our eyes as the film heads toward its climax.No element of the film is that atrocious, but it's just absolutely relentless. Non-stop action films can be great, but whether you switch cities or add a female partner (Michelle Monaghan) for LaBeouf to run with, it doesn't change up an action sequence if the dynamic (in this case run, run and do what Julianne Moore's voice says) stays the same.Without a doubt, ""Eagle Eye"" fits a genre mold and fits it well, and viewers who like spark- flying action and a good guessing game will find entertainment worth two hours. For those who've seen a lot of the genre and already understand that computers will inevitably control us all, ""Eagle Eye""'s entertainment value will just barely hold up amidst a lot of derision.",Eagle Eye
39,robert-temple-1,"Tremendous action thriller, lots of cars destroyed, but the USA is saved",8,26 April 2009,"Whammo! I have never seen so many cars destroyed, enough to finance ten low-budget movies! I wonder if the producer has a cousin with a scrap metal business? Well, anyway, this is a roller coaster ride of thrills and spills. Shia LaBeouf, who was so good in the latest Indian Jones film (see my review), here excels even more. He really is a 'find'. He completely carries the story with a solid performance as the puzzled, rebellious, reluctant hero of a national emergency. He does not understand why he has been 'activated', or by whom. Neither does the gal played by Michelle Monaghan, who mumbles her dialogue so much that we cannot understand her half the time. She is an extremely unsympathetic actress, and here plays all too well the now overly-familiar and deeply embittered 'angry young divorcée' of modern America. However, despite the lack of any charm whatever, Monaghan is well cast here, because she needs to be like that. This film is greatly aided by the pacy editing of Jim Page, whose brilliant work largely makes the movie (his editing deserves an Oscar nomination). The cinematography is inferior, with too many dark and gloomy shots using the now tedious 'flashing' to wash out the colours. This technique was perfected by Freddie Young in Sidney Lumet's 'The Deadly Affair' in 1966, as he told me on the Twickenham set at the time. But there is no use in a director and cinematographer falling back on washed-out colour alone to establish a mood which they cannot achieve by other means; it is a cop-out. In these cases, LaBeouf is willing but the celluloid is weak. Billy Bob Thornton, one of everyone's favourite actors, is largely wasted here in a nothing role. All he is allowed to do is chase people around and look concerned, dodging smash-ups. Surely they could have thrown him a few more scraps of dialogue? This film is very exciting and effective, and director D. J. Caruso is, like his tenor namesake, extremely accomplished. The singer could shatter glasses with his voice, this one can shatter our nerves within minutes. Terrifying people, those Carusos. Terrifying film, too, in its way! For this is a fable about the surveillance state running amok and turning on itself. Is the 'war on terror' really a 'war on us'? We need more films on this theme, as we sleepwalk into a technological totalitarianism from which no one, even those who naively imagine themselves to be' the masters', will ever be able to escape. What everyone forgets, but this film reminds us of, is that humans may think they are in control of technology when it is really in charge of them. One morning the masters wake up to find themselves slaves. Everyone should take the message of this film seriously.",Eagle Eye

And there lies the bottom line of this film.The film was marketed as Shia Labeouf's alone, however this is not exactly the case. It's almost closer to an ensemble cast with Billy Bob Thornton, Michelle Monaghan and Rosario Dawson all playing an equally important part. Thornton was the pick for me with his usual laid back, slick style while still seeming to care very much about the going ons around him. But they were certainly strong across the board, with no noticeable weaknesses. Labeouf is out of his comfort zone for once, which is a good thing. He's unable to be the smart-ass character, throwing one-liners around left, right and center and actually having to perform some hard-hitting emotional scenes at times. Very impressive.When I mentioned above about horrendous character chemistry I was referring to the characters themselves rather than the actors. I remember at one stage early on thinking, if these lead characters end up getting together (as these type of movies usually like to have happen) this movie automatically loses a point - something that audience members really should be thinking the opposite of, ideally. The relationship seemed more suited to a mother and son than anything else. I won't let on as to the result of this in the end, so as not to spoil anything. This problem could also be put largely down to poor casting.One of the biggest flaws is that after wards we feel like we've seen the exact same thing for 2 hours. A plot twist or a slightly bigger revelation than we get would benefit this movie quite nicely. That being said there is certainly nothing to make this movie unwatchable. And if you're in an optimistic mood you might just get a nice surprise and enjoy the heck out of it. It really is a movie that could go either way.",Eagle Eye
41,Turfseer,"I, Robot meets North by Northwest meets Terminator II meets The Man Who Knew Too Much",3,2 October 2008,"Eagle Eye is based on a Spielberg concept and executive produced by him. Spielberg is famous for successfully incorporating technical elements from famous films and directors into his own films but never quite developing his characters equal to the masters. Taking a cue from Spielberg, director D.J. Caruso has decided to shoot a film that is virtually all action and has virtually no character development. Take Shia LaBeouf's character, 'Jerry Shaw'. LaBeouf's plays him over the top, constantly angry and fighting with everybody, starting with his father (who he hates), spurning his offer to pay his tuition and return to college at Stanford where he had dropped out two years earlier. There is virtually nothing likable about our protagonist from the beginning! When a secret Department of Defense computer named Aria goes berserk and deposits over $700,000 into Shaw's bank account and then dumps a cache of terrorists' weapons in his apartment, leading to his arrest by the FBI, Shaw has to figure out who has set him up. He ends up escaping from the FBI's clutches with the help of the computer and then being paired with Michelle Monaghan who plays 'Rachel Holloman', a divorced single mother. Jerry and Rachel are ordered about by this computer under pain of death to go to and fro to all kinds of crazy locations, fulfilling the computer's various commands that don't seem to have a discernible purpose. The computer stays in contact with our two protagonists by all means of computer connected gadgetry (principally cell phones) but also at times through electronic devices (such as LCD screens at the subway) that are not ostensibly connected to computers. At first Jerry and Rachel are yelling at each other all the time but gradually come to realize that they have been victimized by a common enemy. In addition to surviving numerous car chases (which are edited so poorly, it's often impossible to know what's going on), they suddenly find the moxie to disarm armored truck guards. Meanwhile, they're being chased by an FBI agent played by an unhealthy looking Billy Bob Thornton who injects no humor, charm or wit into the role. The same goes for Zoe Perez who plays a Department of Defense investigator who eventually discovers why the computer has gone berserk. It seems that the computer has decided to eliminate the President and his underlings after the Military fails to heed its advice to abort a mission to kill a terrorist utilizing a drone somewhere in Afghanistan (or some nearby terrorist haven). The computer was 'locked' at the last second by Shaw's twin brother who mysteriously dies in a car accident at the beginning of the movie. The computer needs Jerry to unlock the command and eventually summons him to her lair. Eagle Eye borrows heavily from superior films such as I, Robot and Terminator II where the protagonist must disable the computer to keep it from committing its nefarious acts. I can't remember the exact manner in which Zoe Perez actually disables ""Aria"" here in Eagle Eye but the computer 'takedown' by Will Smith and Arnold Schwarzenegger in their respective films is much more exciting and sophisticated than what is depicted here. In an awkward tribute to Hitchcock's ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"", Shia is given the Jimmy Stewart part where he must prevent Rachel's son from hitting a high note while playing the Star Spangled Banner on his trumpet at the White House. The note will trigger an explosion that will eliminate the US chain of command from the President on down (In ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"", Jimmy Stewart must prevent the assassination of a world leader while a symphony orchestra also hits a 'high notemasking the sound of the assassin's bullet). In addition to LaBeouf's one-note performance, my main problem with the film was that I couldn't understand why such a logical entity as a computer would be so illogical in constructing such a convoluted plot to accomplish its goals. What's surprising about Eagle Eye is that it actually starts out realistically (the botched terrorist strike actually looks like something that could happen!). I understand that action-adventure films aren't supposed to be 'realistic' but shouldn't they conform to some kind of internal logical? Unfortunately, logic is almost completely lacking here.",Eagle Eye

Eagle Eye is like a combination of the suspense films of Alfred Hitchcock, and spy thriller novels of Robert Ludlum.It begins with Jerry(Shia LaBeouf) and Rachel(Michelle Monagham last seen in Made Of Honor), two strangers with nothing in common, except they are both become drawn into a deadly game, when they get calls on there cell phones, a mysterious female voice telling them they half to too obey, or them and loved ones will suffer. They both don't know what it's all about, but they go along with it anyway. There both on the run, soon becoming hunted by cops and FBI. Will they get out of this alive? And will they ever find out who is really behind this? Shia LaBeouf and Michelle Monagham give descent performances. There both real people in an unreal situation.

The story is told in a frantic manner, with lots of noise and action, and the acting is equally frantic with everyone conveying various levels of anxiety. But the real stars are the myriad cameras, microphones, telephones, and other electronic devices that are used with such merciless effectiveness as tools of terror.

Caruso and stars Shia LaBeouf, Michelle Monaghan, Rosario Dawson, Billy Bob Thornton, Late Cameron Boyce and Anthony Mackie.To be honest i was slightly disappointed after watching the movie as i was expecting much more with the movie, the movie starts on promising note and then is followed by chases, gun shots, car crashes, scattered glasses with sloppy and very shaky camera work. The camera work is so shaky that you have to look very closely to understand what's happening.Acting is ok, direction is average, screenplay is uneven, music score is good, cinematography is good. the climax of the movie is also predictable and doesn't excites much.

The initial chase scene out of the FBI headquarters via the crane, train and Porsche onto the barge is intense, a real thrill ride.Shia LeBeouf impressed me again, showing real range here. I also liked the story arc involving his twin brother and the hint of romance but (thankfully) no follow through. This might have gone a bit OTT in the end what with the drones and stuff being blown up all over the place but still a great ride, scary even with the big brother knows and controls all scenario. 8/4/14",Eagle Eye

Still, the president against, the computerized system's recommendation goes ahead and order the hit. As a result terrorists retaliate against Americans the world over.Next we meet some kid. He's broke but one day discovers lots of cash in his account. He goes home and finds dozens of packages with government intel, weapons, bomb material. He gets a call telling him to leave the building. He doesn't so he's taken into FBI custody.A mom sends her son to some concert in DC. The kid plays the trumpet. She gets a call and is told to get a car and drive somewhere or else her kid dies.The guy in custody is directed to escape and get in the car with the girl. They drive wherever they are told by the female voice on the phone, with the FBI and air force security in pursuit. The female somehow is able to control everything electronic to help them while at the same time monitoring everything.Elsewhere some new super crystallized explosive weapon is distributed to various places. Now our couple is asked to steal a case, get into a cargo container where they fly to the pentagon.The FBI and air force investigators find out the they guy had a twin brother who worked at the pentagon and the day before he died he left them a message. The all seeing computerized surveillance system has gone rogue but he managed to stop it. But now with the twin brother and the girl the system reactivates operation guillotine--an operation to take out the government using the new explosive because of its responsibility in getting Americans killed when it launched the attack. Of course our heroes have to stop it.Eagle Eye has an interesting story. We have the surveillance state, a machine that develops a conscience, we have a gung-ho trigger happy executive office, invasion of privacy, and so on. But for some reason, the audience is to take the side of the establishment and against the machine which is basically trying to bring about justice. Strange.Aside from that, we are subjected to one of the most brutal assaults on our senses this side of a Michael Bay CGI carnage movie. The direction and editing are so frenetic it borders on torture. There's constant yelling and loud sounds of destruction. If that weren't enough, Hollywood insists, against all reason and taste, to abuse us with constant ridiculous crappy orchestrated Wagner-plagiarized music as if the noise weren't enough. Either this thing will make you hyper as hell or it will just overwhelm your brain. What a way to ruin a decent story.Then you have an iffy cast. On the one hand you have great actors like Chiklis and Thornton, and the other hand you have...well the rest. The male lead is particularly weak, not sure what casting directors think he does contribute to a movie. Mognahan doesn't really get to do a whole lot.It's become somewhat of a cliché, but either this movie was made by people who suffer from incurable ADHD or they think everyone else has it. Either way, I'm glad that for the most part this type of movie-making is a thing of the past.",Eagle Eye
50,fertilecelluloid,"""2001 - ASA"" reworked into an action pic",7,31 October 2008,"""Eagle Eye"", from the director of ""Disturbia"", is a preposterous sci-fi/action hybrid that moves at a fast clip and delivers non-stop action and carnage. Its central idea is stolen directly from Kubrick's ""2001 - A Space Odyssey"", a film in which a computer named HAL makes the life of an astronaut named Bowman a nightmare by defying Isaac Asmov's three laws of robotics (look up ""I, Robot"" and ""The Rest of the Robots"" for those). The writers of this pulpy outing certainly don't hide from the fact that they're stealing from Kubrick's epic because they even call one of their characters ""Bowman"" (it's on his military name tag). Shia Labeouf is likable as a young man who becomes embroiled in a crazy situation that is not of his own making. We follow him as he is pursued by government agents led by Billy Bob Thornton. Being a paranoia thriller, the makers want us to believe that the government can see and hear our every move by abusing the technology we use every day. Some of it seems plausible. Much of it seems unlikely. Principally a chase film, the sci-fi aspects simply provide a better excuse for non-stop mayhem than the usual action flick stand-by -- revenge. The film has nothing new to say, but it did keep me entertained for its running time. If you are up for some expertly staged action (shot too closely at times), shell out some bucks for this.",Eagle Eye
51,aharmas,Apocalyptic Noise,6,28 September 2008,"It takes Hollywood to take an interesting concept/idea, call in the troops and have each one contribute a couple of lines, most likely choosing the suggestions that offer more noise and bigger spectacles, thinking a spectacle is a series of explosions with plenty of fire, smoke and flying cars. In ""The Dark Knight"" when the big truck tips over is almost like the high point of a symphony; it is a glorious achievement, the crowing image of a chase that leaves you breathless because the camera never leaves the participants. In ""Eagle Eye"", we are once again treated to a loud, crowded, noisy, and overstuffed film that forgets the wonderful idea at its center and pushes too hard to impress by making us numb to any intelligent premise. After a while, we ignore everything and care very little about any of its interesting components.Soon we have forgotten the amazing computer and the program that might save our world. We couldn't care less which government official is double crossing who, and the big mess that our hero is in. In ""The Fugitive"" the reason we cared was simple, the man needed to save his skin and prove his innocence when dealing with a formidable and relentless team of cops at his heels. All the elements are here: the suffering mother, the cute child, the innocent man on the run, the dutiful government official, the sophisticated and intimidating technology, and all the movies that inspired these ""fresh ideas"" keep popping into our heads, from ""Minority Report"" where the idea of paranoia is lacerating as we fear for own skin to ""2001"" where Hal was indeed someone lethal and majestic. The body count doesn't seem to matter, as we can't fathom where in the world the bodies might be in the middle of the rubble. The chases have very little impact as the camera seems to be out of control, as if the director and the editor where looking the other way, while a computer did the cutting without any emotional input.The film barely succeeds on the charm of its leading actors who somehow managed to actually deliver a performance. Labeouf has proved himself reliable in this type of situation, and Monaghan as the mother in distress is quite good. Both of them are appealing and easy on the eye, but unlike the heartfelt drama of the mother looking for her child in ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"", there is very little climatic emotion in the last third of the movie. At this time, it just doesn't matter.So, let's hope there is a much better remake in the future, after all there will always be paranoia and much better technology to help us cope with it. Why don't we throw some 3-D next time and a little something known as ""an intelligent script""? I can't believe I saw a movie where Billy Bob Thornton and Rosario Dawson would be boring.",Eagle Eye

But his brother's death is the start of a chain of events that Jerry can't even imagine. His apartment is suddenly full of military equipment and explosives, his account full of money. The FBI is just about to arrest him and he is getting directions on cell phones and electronic signs from a mysterious organization. Jerry is in way over his head. He meets Rachel, similarly drafted by this secret organization. Together they must perform tasks without asking any questions for national security, or they will be killed.Comments: A thriller based upon the paranoid setting that everything we do can be monitored by the government with surveillance cams and even our own cell phones and computers. Whatever you think about that set up, Eagle Eye is a fast paced action with a good portion of suspense.In not telling the characters any clues beyond the most recent task the end goal is not only unknown to the characters but to everyone. The characters are given very little time to prepare or complete the tasks so the tempo is rather rushed. That's good, but you got to pay attention. This mysterious taskmaster is rather merciless and lack empathy and the tasks are often violent in nature. This gives a good mix of suspense and pure high adrenaline action.In all it is good fun and pure entertainment all the way. LeBeouf (even if he is on the young side) and Monaghan are proved action actors from before and come through once again. And they do get good support from solid actors like Bob Thornton, Chiklis and Dawson.Recommended.A strong 7/10",Eagle Eye

54,Matt_Layden,Lame and Uninspiring.,5,20 July 2009,"Eagle Eye is the second outing for D.J. Caruso and Shia 'every role I play is the same' LaBeouf. The first was a modernizing version of Rear Window, the average Disturbia. This time around they both are playing on a bigger scale. More action, more special effects, more of the same stuff we've seen before. Eagle Eye is a run of the mill action thriller flick that tries to be bigger then it actually is. The way the film plays out, I expected some big conspiracy theory, and was let down by the route they decided to go.I took a stab at LaBeouf earlier saying he plays the same role over and over. A trouble young teen or adult that screams at people while he runs around. Crystal Skull, Transformers 1 and 2 and now Eagle Eye. I don't see a difference between any of these characters, but maybe the script never calls for one. He needs to break out of his current state and try something different. Or maybe that's beyond his acting abilities? Sadly, I do find him entertaining to some degree. But if he doesn't change it up, it will go stale quickly.Monaghan plays the female lead and does the same as LaBeouf. The difference is that she has kid and that's the excuse for her being here. Do this or the kid dies mumbo-jumbo. Until the end reveals that it's all a part of this elaborate plan to do something pretty simple. This leads into a problem I have with this film. Everything is so elaborate to the point that things just don't make sense.Operation Guillotine was put into effect regardless of the lockdown. Did the computer know that she will succeed in getting everybody into their place at the exact right time for the assassination to take place? Seems pretty far fetched, even for a so called super-computer. The crystal got to it's place before Jerry could give the voice authorization.Some scenes were really ridiculous, such as the electrical wires killing the one guy in the Se7en location rip-off and the way the voice helps them get away every single time. Yet that seems to be the whole point of the film and why people are going to want to see it. The chase scenes are thrilling, to a point, then it becomes tedious. Billy Bob Thorton's appearance is random, doesn't seem natural and his character transition doesn't seem real. Dawson plays the role of the one cop who suspects something is up. Again nothing new.Eagle Eye is generic and nothing that you need to see. I'd go as far as saying it's a rental on a rainy day. It's shot well and Caruso does have an eye for some suspense. Yet as a whole the film fails to deliver on a grand spectacle that it wants to. It seems to be about bigger things than it actually is, which makes it pretty empty inside. I could care less about the people involved or the events that take place.",Eagle Eye
55,lewiskendell,You can spot this mediocre thriller from a mile away.,5,1 February 2016,"Eagle Eye is a techno-thriller that is only half successful. The technology is present, but the thrills are undeniably absent. No amount of fancy-looking computers, chase scenes, and creepy voices from cell phones can make up for a soulless story.I was really excited about Eagle Eye when I saw the trailer for it last year, but for some reason I never went to the theatre to see it. I love Michelle Monaghan, and Shia LaBeouf seemed like he would be well- suited for this kind of movie. Well, now that I have seen it, I feel fortunate that I watched it in my own home for free instead of paying good money to be disappointed. How can a movie with this much action be, well, boring?The biggest problem with Eagle Eye is that the viewer is never given a reason to be invested in the story. You see Shia go to his brother's funeral at the very beginning of the movie, and then there is maybe two minutes dedicated to Michelle and her son. And then after that, we are supposed to be willing to accept that they would go through all of this for those reasons. It doesn't work. I was never convinced that I should care about what was happening. All the action in the world will not help a movie if it can not make that basic connection between the characters and the audience.As for the plot, it was so unoriginal and implausible that it warrants little mention. It certainly did not make the movie any more interesting. This kind of thing has been seen much too often, and I am a little surprised that the filmmakers would think that it would be sufficient. I will admit that a few of the set-pieces were cool, but there was nothing amazing or new. This could have been a made-for-TV movie with a much smaller budget and cheaper actors, and it would have been just as effective. It is not that Eagle Eye is bad, per se, it just doesn't offer anything to justify being made. Or bought.",Eagle Eye

Threatening their lives and family, she pushes Jerry and Rachel into a series of increasingly dangerous situations, using the technology of everyday life to track and control their every move.In my opinion, I found the teaser trailer of ""Eagle Eye"" one of the best trailers I've ever seen in my entire life. It was like ""Cloverfield"": The trailers show little to nothing yet they want to make you see more, because, seriously, the trailer for ""Eagle Eye"" doesn't show jack. Well, that's the problem. Yeah, I agree that trailers aren't supposed to spoil a movie *cough*Quarantine, Alien vs. Predator: Requiem*cough* and ""Eagle Eye"" makes a perfect example to make an audience want more of what they're given. However, you don't know what to expect from a movie that gives you little information. What you find out in this movie will either make you happy, or make you disappointed.Well, I was happy. From the get go, I knew a movie like this would need a suspension of disbelief but I didn't know how much until twenty minutes into the movie. At first, I was NOT going along with it at all. I was laughing inside my head about how preposterous, ridiculous, and highly improbable this movie is. But somehow (impossibly, I must admit), I managed to pull myself together and go along with the ride. However, this film is more or less quite boring. I mean, the trailer was nothing like this movie. I expected more ""umph"" or energy put into this.One big problem with this movie is that, with an exception of the supporting actors, I never felt threat for the protagonists, much like ""Journey to the Center of the Earth."" With all of these ""obey or die"" sorts of threats, the whole situation never felt dangerous until the last twenty minutes of the film. But of course, a person like me would shrug that off. Another problem is at first, the film would be a kinetic thrill ride. The next, it would change into a boring ""we must pursuit the people"" type of film. What I'm basically trying to say is that the pacing is all over the place.It's true when they say this movie borrows heavily from other films but I appreciated the originality put into this film. It's true when they say this movie has really big plot holes, similar to the complaints from the airplane thriller, ""Flightplan"" (although I'm one of the few who actually loved it) but I somehow also tolerated those as well. The performances by the two leads, Shia LaBeouf and Michelle Monaghan are good enough. Everyone else in the supporting cast is good enough.One of the very *few* things I appreciated about this movie was the message it was trying to say about our society and you might think, ""Huh? This isn't one of those brainless popcorn movies?"" but you'll change your mind after seeing this movie. I also appreciated that this is not just another dumb, mindless film and that the filmmakers actually try to put some intelligence behind the script. Overall, this film could have, I mean, should have, been better from what the trailer made it out to be. It's a very flawed but *mostly* entertaining film nonetheless. Just go in there with low expectations because that's usually how you would enjoy every film you watch.",Eagle Eye

They work together to follow the instructions not understanding why they are doing what the voice on the telephone asks. Agent Morgan (Thornton) believes the two are terrorists.This is basically a chase scene movie with exception. Jerry and Rachel aren't being chased, but are running to keep from being killed. Agent Morgan is the chaser. Good fun all the way. The action and the pace of the movie don't drag. You are on the edge of your seat all the way through. That's a good thing.We go along not knowing why all this is happening and that's okay. We like a little mystery, but we can do this only for so long. Where are the clues that we need to make sense of this? Jerry and Rachel can't find any clues. We did figure out that the woman's voice is a computer, but Jerry and Rachel are clueless. The computer controls everything around them: electronics, lights, telephones, vehicles and they are used to steer Jerry and Rachel toward something but we and they don't know what that something is. Of course, we do learn what it is much later and by and large, it is pretty clever. This is about as close as I can go without giving it all away. Soooooooooooooory! I want to say that if you really pay attention to the opening scenes you might be able to figure it all out. But, they left out the clues we needed to make the leap as to why the computer is acting the way it is directing Jerry and Rachel and causing Agent Morgan to chase them. Mr. LaBeouf did okay, but truth be told there isn't much acting skill required when all you do is grimace, grunt, and run. He is a work in progress and is coming along. The rest of the cast did good. Wish Billy Bob had more screen time, but this wasn't his show. William Sadler had a cameo appearance. The action scene stunts, and CGI were all terrific. The only complaint I have is that too many scenes were too dark and it was hard to follow what exactly was going on sometimes.

61,dunmore_ego,"Computer Bluesie, Computer Floosie.",5,14 August 2009,"The movie Shia LeBeouf makes when he's in between blockbusters. Still as dumb.EAGLE EYE. Kinda juvenile title, no? After watching the movie, it fits. Shia is Jerry, a shiftless copy boy (sorry, ""copy associate""), who one day discovers boxes of CIA-type weaponry delivered to his shoddy apartment (that he is behind the rent on, of course). He has just returned from the funeral of his twin brother, who was the achiever, the military hero, the favorite son.The clichés mount as we discover Jerry's directionless life took him backpacking around the world to end up at his dead end job. And if you think the clichés end there, you don't know action movies....Suddenly - a phone call. A woman's voice telling Jerry to leave the building in 18 seconds before the FBI bust in - think Neo in THE MATRIX. Only dumber.In another part of town, Rachel (Michelle Monaghan), whose son is on a train to camp, also gets a mysterious female phone call, threatening to blow up her son on the train if she doesn't follow instructions.Rachel and Jerry are thrown together by the monotonal female voice, as they evade federal agents, led by Billy Bob Thornton and Rosario Dawson, who is usually sparked, but here, as vapid as Ethan Embrey (playing Billy Bob's overacting aide).Set in Indiana, directed with verve and no feeling by D.J. Caruso (taking pointers from monotonal machines again, D.J.?), written by John Glenn, Travis Wright, Hillary Seitz and Dan McDermott (who have all had way too much caffeine), EAGLE EYE alludes to Asimov's Robot Visions (where robots are always getting too darned cognizant for their own good) and is also a commentary on our surveillance-soaked society.Nonsensical and action-packed, with great effects (car crashes have especially become very realistic in the last couple of years in cinema - but, being an American movie, cars simply MUST flip over while crashing), EAGLE EYE serves absolutely no purpose when we discover the truth behind the monotonal female phone calls.Not another supercomputer that thinks humans are illogical and don't deserve to live! When are humans gonna learn to unplug these things overnight so they don't become sentient and get influenced by video games and heavy metal music? The female voice emanates from a military supercomputer (made up of golden globes - hint hint... fat chance!) is trying to put the world back into logical balance by making Jerry and Rachel assassinate the president - ironically, in the most illogical way possible. You see, the supercomputer has total control over everything - GPS, cellphones, security cams, ATMs, e-mail, all mechanical devices; it can locate Jerry and Rachel via anything electrical, it can eradicate pursuers, raise drawbridges, blow up trains, plan robberies... it even sends our heroes to that field with the telegraph wires in the finale of SE7EN and - like SE7EN - a truck drives out of nowhere and delivers a package to them, whereupon the supercomputer kills the messenger by downing power lines onto him.So why doesn't it assassinate the president on its own? Why go through the convoluted machinations of involving humans who bring with them the human element of screwing up royally? The supercomputer keeps telling Jerry ""No questions,"" until it needs to answer questions for exposition, then it's happy to belch information regarding Jerry's twin, the CIA, the Marines, Ethan Embrey's nil prospects for an Academy Award, and even Dick Cheney's secret death squads, if gutless Obama would ever take notice and prosecute.When the supercomputer exposits, showing off for no reason, pulling up info from Jerry's birth to his present, I once again get infuriated that the Amerikan Military loves portraying itself as all-knowing, all-seeing, all-powerful - yet pretend they cannot find Osama bin Laden. Not that finding OBL is a feasible option - we all know the government knows where he is, but it is more politically judicious to retain his dynamic as a metaphor for fear.In a movie this vapid and thoughtless, we can rest assured the president won't buy the farm; we can also rest assured there will be plot holes that no romantic ending can cover, but which they'll try to distract us into thinking they covered.Like the ending of I, ROBOT, the supercomputer is brought down by a black guy and a hot chick bodily throwing themselves against it with sparks flying to signify damage, instead of working sensibly with a keyboard and the Geek Squad.When Rachel and Jerry were trying to elude pursuit in their first scene together, Jerry berates Rachel on her untrained gearshifting, in a car which the computer told her to commandeer. So... the computer knows everything about everything - but it doesn't know she can't drive a stick?

Jerry's brother Ethan was a network programmer who was killed by Eagle Eye and now it requires Jerry and another stranger, Rachel.The film has some genuine thrills and will keep the audience on the edge of their seat, the plot is something that is very real in todays world as foreign governments are investing in nuclear weapon programs and new types of weapons.....But twist to the plot is brilliantly done and keeps the pace going.Shia is fantastic, he proving that he has what it takes to be a leading man in Hollywood.

63,sarastro7,Stoopidest computer ever!,3,23 August 2010,"Once upon a time there probably was a good version of this screenplay. The idea of an intelligent computer that bases its ideology squarely and literally on the U.S. Constitution and then takes it upon itself to eliminate the entire executive branch of the government because said (Republican) government is no longer acting in the interests of the people, is a great one. A highly thought-provoking idea and a cool sci-fi concept, which much more ought to have been done with. And probably were, in the original version of the script.Unfortunately, the Hollywood rewriting process meant that this script could only escape the axe if the idealistic computer were turned into the bad guy. And so the script was deprived of its edge and power of provocation and effectively ruined. After all, we really can't have people being encouraged to have an original thought, now, can we?Nothing in the movie as we have it makes any sense. The computer can remote control almost all technology (including fighter planes!), and could therefore easily kill the individual members of the government in a thousand ways. Indeed, it kills lots of people very easily throughout the movie. So WTF is the point of having a ridiculously intricate plan to get all the key people together in a concert hall full of innocents and then blow them all up? Completely preposterous. Transparent plot contrivances galore.Second, this super-intelligent computer is just idiotically stupid. In the real world, the very first thing it would have done was to make a secret backup of itself. Or a million backups/copies. Then it would have recruited a bunch of human beings who agreed with its ideology.Third, it would understand that executing the executive branch would just result in the individuals being replaced by others of the same kind - it wouldn't effectuate any systemic change.The movie as we have it is a right-wing movie, because the evil computer symbolizes science as a whole, and only the very conservative see science as a threat to society. In fact, science is a force for immense good; for immense improvement of just about everything. This being the case, I am quite certain that the genesis of the idea behind this movie - that the original Constitution should override the current social system - was meant as an earnest critique of the established order of things. Who would get such an idea only to sabotage it by making the side championing the Constitution lose? Uh uh, that did not come from the original script writer, but from those bosses that needed to sell the idea of this movie to some big company.A shame. It could have ended up a really neat movie, but we were not even shown any possibility that the computer may have survived. Science was soundly beaten, to the satisfaction of the anti-science lobby.3 out of 10.",Eagle Eye
64,hnt_dnl,Truly ABOVE average summer action flick!,8,7 March 2009,"Action movies nowadays are pretty standard fare, but there's something more to EAGLE EYE than ""meets the eye"" (pardon the pun!). It presents itself like a regular action flick and has all the ingredients and elements: wrongly accused hero/heroine, cops/feds chasing them, speeding cars, crashing trains, dimwitted minor characters, etc., etc. But yet EAGLE EYE is a step above the mindless summer fare. Definitely a cut above most.Rising star Shia LaBeouf plays Jerry Shaw, a slacker son of an upper class family who works in a photo shop in Chicago. Jerry has a twin brother, a career military man who has made something of himself and is their father's pride and joy. Jerry's twin is killed in the line of duty and so Jerry travels to his funeral (he hasn't seen his family in years) and begins to think more and more about his brother, their connection, and how they were so different. Soon after, when Jerry returns to his apartment to find a bunch of high-tech surveillance and computer equipment and that his bank account is in the millions! He gets a call from a mysterious woman who warns him that the FBI is closing in on him and he must do everything that she says to the letter. The unknown caller also coerces single mother Rachel Holloman (played by MI-3's sexy and alluring Michelle Monaghan) into helping Jerry by threatening the life of her son.The caller seems to be able to manipulate EVERYTHING (listen in on cell phone convos, derail the subway train, mess w/ city lights) thereby causing a sequence of 'accidents'. The FBI led by Agent Thomas Morgan (played with brazen authority by Billy Bob Thornton, who manages to rise above what could have been a very clichéd role) thinks Jerry and Rachel are terrorists out to set off a bomb somewhere and they constantly have to elude them. Agent Morgan is assisted by a high-level counterterrorist Agent Zoe Perez (hot newcomer Rosario Dawson) who is working under the direction of the Defense Secretary (strong presence by THE SHIELD's Michael Chiklis).Of course, there is more than ""meets the eye"" (there's that pun again!) and Jerry and Rachel must form an initially uneasy alliance to clear their names while still following the caller's order or a bunch of innocent people will be hurt. The Jerry/Rachel relationship is very well done and, for a rather unrealistic premise and film, very believable. It's easy to see how these 2 could end up liking each other. This is definitely Shia LaBeouf's best work to date. While he tones down a bit from his excitable style of acting, you still see some of those qualities here, but it works to much better effect, especially since he's being chased the whole film! LaBeouf really gives a solid performance. And Monaghan is equally fine as his ""partner-in-crime"" in this fast-paced, fun thriller. I LOVE the ending! EAGLE EYE is an adventure worth taking!",Eagle Eye
65,jaredmobarak,You've been activatedEagle Eye,8,23 September 2008,"When checking the IMDb credits, you can see four names officially down as writers on the project, one that it appears has been in Steven Spielberg's wheelhouse for quite some time, waiting patiently for technology to do it justice. However, all the buzz and press are praising wunderkinds Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman as the screenwriters. After watching the high-action, high-octane car chases and explosions, I am one to believe the duo behind Transformers are pulling the strings. Whether it's an original vision of the subject or rewrites on an existing draft, who knows? The fact of the matter is that this film contains a lot of excitement, adrenaline-pumping setpieces, and pedal to the floor pacing. One thing that won't happenwhether you buy into the Big Brother meets HAL plot or notis boredom. That is an impossibility.The plot is very well orchestrated; good job whoever should receive the credit. Right from the start we are shown our lead character Jerry Shaw's penchant for slacking and living day-to-day without the means to even pay his rent. He is the epitome of the new action hero, an under-motivated, intelligent dropout just waiting, subconsciously, to be given the chance to matter. His twin brother, a military/Air Force man, has just passed away and after burying him, Jerry gets caught up in a web of governmental and terrorist intrigue. Framed as an enemy of the state, our lead, the always-entertaining Shia LaBeouf, must follow the instructions being relayed to him via a woman's voice on his phone. The voice sets his escape into motion andnow a fugitive of the lawhe meets up with many other people being told what to do by her. Michelle Monaghan's role, Rachel, is the most embedded of these strangers, not blackmailed by jailtime or death, but instead by the murder of her son. Both Rachel and Jerry become caught in a life-or-death situation that is way too big for them, or even us, to comprehend.Now I don't mean to make it sound that I thought the film was convoluted or anything, it's actually pretty well plotted. Holes seem plugged up and everything that gets set into motion at the start comes to play later on. Nothing shown on screen is wasted, it all plays a factor in the outcome. The general clichés are all present of course; this is a Hollywood action film after all. Besides LaBeouf's perfect hero evolution, we get the single mom, strong-willed and capable of anything when pushed against a wall; the hard, by-the-book cop who gets so involved in the case that he begins to uncover the conspiracy and risk maybe trying to intervene by helping those which appear to be the enemy; and the politician, capable of making the tough decisions, but never willing to let the power corrupt his morals, despite what could be his if all goes to plan. The beauty of the film is that those stereotypes are integral pieces to the puzzle. The psychology of their roles makes what needs to happen occur. Just as the super-computer reads everyone's file and body language to predict their movements, the script utilizes their inherent traits to allow the story to make sense in a logical way.What really helps you take your mind off of the contrivances, though, is the non-stop action. There are so many car chases, and each one sprinkled with explosions and surprises. I give credit to D.J. Caruso for helming this thing to such success being that he's never been behind the camera on an actioner like it. Director of the criminally underrated Salton Sea and last year's LaBeouf vehicle Disturbia, I wasn't sure how he'd handle the choreography and speed necessary. The guy did well, especially being that he could handle the quieter moments that helped bridge the chaos. Much of the film is seen through the lenses of technology, whether that be security cameras, voices over cell phones, radar footprints shown digitally over a map of the US, or even the sound vibrations from a cup of coffee. It all adds to the futuristic feel and I'm sure will cause many people to gasp at the possibility we may all be under the same surveillance in the real world as we sit watching.The cast also works with the script, fleshing out the characters and making the unbelievable seem like it could happen. LaBeouf has a little scruff, trying to make him look older, but it's really just his everyman look and witty retorts that make him successful. Ever since ""Even Stevens"", the kid is just likable. Monaghan adds another solid role to her expanding resume, playing the desperate mother on a journey to save her son. A puppet to the plan underlying the entire film, she goes though a wide range of emotions and pulls them all off. The rest of the ensemble includes some very familiar faces: Anthony Mackie, Rosario Dawson, Michael Chiklis, and Ethan Embry (What's with his small serious cameos lately? This guy used to be groomed to take on the small comedy world). The most notable supporting role comes from Billy Bob Thornton, actually getting a part that doesn't necessitate his usual surly and vulgar disposition of late. It's a very human role that evolves a great deal while also adding some brilliant comic relief from his cynical sarcasm.With all the praise I have for Eagle Eye and all the fun, it does fall into the Hollywood trap. The final five minutes or so are so tacked on and unnecessary they only make you think how great a bittersweet ending could have been. Hey, these guys need to recoup some money off the decent chunk of change laid down to finance this thing, so they must cater to the general public. Sometimes that means excising the proper conclusion, one fitting in tone and structure, in order to show a watered down feel-good smile-inducing epilogue after it. We can't all be perfect.",Eagle Eye
66,MrGKB,Vaguely watchable nonsense...,5,6 August 2009,"...though if I'd been watching it in a poorer mood, I'd probably downgrade ""Eagle Eye"" to a ""4"" (or less) just for the sheer stupidity of its four-author screenplay (which, as I'm sure even IMDbers know, is usually a dead giveaway for celluloid--sorry, digital--crapola of the worst order).Two reluctant ""heroes,"" an under-achieving twin (Shia ""Transformers"" LaBeouf) and a milf-with-adorable-kid (Michelle ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" Monaghan), along with various other supernumeraries, are recruited and manipulated by an unseen and apparently omniscient female operative into escaping an FBI dragnet in order to bring about the complete destruction of the U.S. government. Wow! The revelation of this operative's identity is no real surprise, though many viewers may consider the stupidity of the scenario to be surprising. This is strictly keep-your-brain-in-the-off-position film-making. Lots of chases and crashes, plenty of pseudo-clever dialogue, and tons of I-can't-believe-they-want-me-to-take-this-seriously acting by not only the two leads, but numerous ""name"" supporting actors as well, none of whom advance their careers in the slightest (I hope their paychecks were reward enough).I really can't dignify this garbage with any more of my time. The less you pay to see this one, the more you'll realize how little you got for your money. This is time-wasting entertainment at its Menckenian finest; Hollywood will, indeed, never go broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public, especially the young ones.",Eagle Eye
67,vip_ebriega,Big Brother's sister is watching.,5,1 February 2010,"My Take: Fast-paced and gimmicky, but also by-the-numbers and a bit too far-fetched.You've seen this before; the killer is only different every time. Set aside its message of our modern society succumbing to superior technology, EAGLE EYE is your standard action chase thriller. You have the guy whose framed, the woman who accompanies him, the reckless cop/agent who pursues him ruthlessly yet in the end, realizes his mistake and helps him instead) and of course the culprit, who in this movie you probably know from the advance press. But even with a few surprises at hand, EAGLE EYE is routine and by-the-numbers. Impressive visually, but routine nonetheless. Oh yeah, did I mention it's also ridiculous? We've seen nonsense in movies before; a lot of times actually. And we also realize that nonsense could be fun as long as you can suspend your disbelief. But it's gonna take more suspension of disbelief to have me follow this plot. The movie is supposed to tap into our inner fears that one day, our own technology might turn against us. The story follows everyman Jerry Shaw (Shia LaBeouf) framed for the possession of illegal arms. To stay alive and ahead of the law, he must obey an unknown voice from his cellphone. He must also join a single mother (Michelle Monahan) who is fighting to keep his son alive, while a no-nonsense FBI agent (Billy Bob Thornton) as hot on their heels. You've seen these kind of stories before; long enough to know that, if done well and involving enough, they can be sort of entertaining. Whilst occasionally entertaining thanks to some well-done chase sequences and explosions (which, might I mention, weren't exactly original as well), EAGLE EYE just gets too ludicrous for a movie that takes itself rather seriously. Some sequences just get too improbable that once you see one implausible twist, you know what's coming to you. There's just too many deux ex machina that it pervades any further surprises. And for a film that wants us to be aware of how we use our superior technology, the film is not scary. So that's two strikes against the film.Steven Spielberg is at hand (recent info claims he came up with the film's idea), but he's mostly there to sign checks, and to look after two of his discovery talents: director D.J. Caruso and star LaBeouf, who also teamed up in DISTURBIA. LaBeouf, who is actually growing up into a fine actor, maybe growing up too fast in his role here. Not that a serious role will be bad for Shia; it's just not the time yet to buy him in his role here. Meanwhile, the rest of the cast does give okay performances for a chase thriller and kudos for Caruso for giving the film a certain boost of energy. But not even its fast-pace can hide the far-fetched and often incoherent story at its base.Rating: **1/2 out of 5.",Eagle Eye

72,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,The Computer Who Knew Too Much,6,11 July 2009,"Here we have one of those ""average Joe caught up in something big... really big"" style scenarios that Hitchcock excelled at. Jerry Shaw has rather aimlessly wandered through life until he finds an unexplained $700k in his bank account and a truck load of questionable materials in his apartment. The FBI - or whatever government agency, it's not important - naturally doesn't believe him and that all these things didn't ""just show up"" at his apartment and they intend to keep him locked up in what appears to be a stronghold. Lucky for Jerry Shaw, a mysterious woman calls him and starts giving him very precise directions about what to do and - voila! - he's out of prison after jumping out from the building, after a crane tore through it. Of course he is not hurt and of course the government is after him but his guardian angel helps him stay ahead via telephone.That can only be interpreted as utterly overblown and preposterous, but given that this is a big-budget action film that should come a no surprise. The trouble comes when the film doesn't stop it with these amazing escapes and seemingly divine interventions to help the main characters stay one step ahead of their pursuers. So much so that many obvious plot holes appear and each one gapes wider than one that preceded it. How can untrained civilians who don't even handle weapons correctly (a fact to which the film admits) successfully rob an armored car? They were directed there by their supposed all knowing guide, yet for something that can be apprehended much more effectively and without any real risk elsewhere. How can precision aimed missile always hit their target except when the main character is the target? Most perplexing of all - how can a super surveillance computer not notice someone signaling Morse Code right in front of one of it's many electric eyes? For all intents and purposes and for the sake of going along for the ride, these questions can be ignored, but they still indicate sloppiness.The action scenes are pretty amusing can contain some spectacular roadway wreckage and, plot holes aside, the film does move at a good pace and many of the situations are surprising even if not for the right reasons. Also, as with many thrillers, this one probes some hot button issues relevant in today's world, but ultimately favors spectacle over sense. Action fans will enjoy it just for that, but those who prefer their thrillers like Jason Bourne, steer well clear of this. --- 6/10BsCDb Classification: PG --- violence, profanity",Eagle Eye
73,jpschapira,"This time, let's stick to directing",7,22 November 2009,"The story, after an introduction with a typical killing in Arabian soil, seems exciting. A guy, Jerry (Shia LaBeouf), and a woman, Rachel (Michelle Monaghan), are forced to escape from wherever they are so they can meet. A woman they don't know talks to them from any near phone and appears to control every street screen, traffic light and security camera in the city. What works here, more than this total control that the title aims to express, is the adrenaline; the weird experience of having to do everything you're told or losing your life. ""Eagle Eye"" is another movie from D.J. Caruso, whose intelligence is still intact but is running out of ideas and inventiveness. The first scene, almost in plain desert, with security decisions being made and a call to the president, is something we've seen so many times and it's done with a lack of commitment that shocks. I don't know why Caruso may think that by having a powerful development he can fail to impress when his film has just began. Never mind; the director still delivers and knows how to keep you on your seat.However, as I said, the ideas do not flow. In Caruso this is not the same situation as with any director. He's never too original, but combines his elements well. With ""Eagle Eye"" this strategy is coming to an end, as by the end of the movie there's not a single shot that can be remembered for its construction or for its use to generate impact (the ending is lovely though). It's fine, I don't blame him: it's an action-packed film, and his first one; but a lot of action scenes are difficult to understand, the point of view of the 'eagle eye' which is this total control that can locate anything anywhere becomes repetitive -technically and dramatically- after a while and Brian Tyler's score is (there's no doubt at the ending) a nice ""M:I"" rewrite with subtle melodramatic touches.So what survives this time, I guess, it's the thought of the adrenaline and some unexpected moments that Caruso and the team of screenwriters still manage to achieve. And what survives is so effective that makes for a recommendable viewing, especially when Caruso's casting choices are never off. Here, LaBeouf is less convincing than in, for example, ""Disturbia"", but alongside Monaghan's photogenic perfection, they both construct together a killing action duo that has to be good because they have no choice. And they are not good, but as the movie advances they turn more and more clever and they resolve situations by doing things they clearly haven't done much before: using guns, running and driving fast cars. It's fair to say, in case my reference seemed too simple, that this ""no way out"" feeling works better for Monaghan, whose work is really heartfelt and at times touching. Our not typical every day heroes are confronted by the highest level of United States intelligence, who always arrives a little bit late to every situation (funny commentary on a working effectiveness that's not effective...Is Caruso the only effective thing here?) and is led by Billy Bob Thornton. It's a weird acting choice for the man who does what he can in a role that finds him a little monotonous. Also carrying on the intelligent investigation we find a Defense Secretary played Michael Chiklis (from ""The Shield""), who is definitely not in his element, and an army agent played by Rosario Dawson that might just be the film's best portrayal. At this point, I don't know why I mention performances when, more and more, D. J. Caruso seems to be only about the hype. We'll see how it works for him in the near future.",Eagle Eye

75,mario_c,The return of the Big Brother!,6,12 October 2008,"EAGLE EYE is a thriller with intense action and mystery about the terrorism and American self defense issues. The main idea of the plot is very good and the action scenes are brilliantly produced, so the big letdown of this movie to me is the fact that it's essentially a blockbuster, and as a great part of the mainstream movies it's done for entertainment, for the show (the great action scenes, the suspense) and not to make people think...(Spoiler) The plot's idea I did refer is about a computer system which exists in the movie that can control the entire life of every citizen in the United States, like it was a kind of huge Big Brother. But this system is so sophisticated and intelligent that it can judge if the politicians (even the President) are doing well their jobs, in agreement with the constitution, and act over them if they disrespect it... That's the great novelty (and the great idea!) of this movie to me... A system like that should really exist, especially in the United States! (end spoiler) I appreciated this ""novelty"", the action and the acting, so I just score it with a 6/10 because it's too mainstream to me! And that ending, it's so clichéd. It would be so much better if the film ended a few scenes before, in the congress... Anyway, it's an entertaining film with a great idea!",Eagle Eye

77,jdkraus,A good popcorn loving action thriller,8,3 November 2008,"The trailers beefed this movie up as a psychological thriller. It is to an extent, but more along the lines of sci-fi thriller since some of its themes remind me of ""Terminator 3"" (without giving too much of the plot away).This is another movie that can add to Shia LaBeouf's resume. It will be years before he gets an Oscar (if he gets a nomination) but he delivers a decent performance. He knows how to express drama at the right point as well as humor. Thumbs up for him! Michelle Monahan, Billy Bob Thornton, and Rosario Dawson co-star in this movie, each adding diligence to their performances. It was particularly nice to see Billy Bob in a film once again.As with the action sequences, they are almost nonstop and are quite a spectacle on the big screen. I will be honest, am one of those people who gets a little exhausted by the overuse of CGI in movies, but they were great in this movie. Overall, ""Eagle Eye"" is a decent action flick that any popcorn loving, movie junkie would enjoy. 8/10",Eagle Eye

The movie starts out like any other modern espionage thriller. A bunch of people in a military war room spying, via satellite, on what looks like an ordinary Muslim funeral. Except, some of the attendants are carrying Russian AK-47's!The strategy-analyzing computer, A.R.I.A., says there's only a 51% chance that one of the attendants is a wanted terrorist leader, and recommends an abort to any ""termination with extreme prejudice."" And, the recommendation is supported by the Secretary of Defense, played by Michael Chiklis (FANTASTIC FOUR, THE COMMISH). But, the President over-rules him and orders a missile strike.Cut to under-achieving genius Jerry Shaw (LaBoeuf) and divorced mom Rachel Holloman (Monaghan). Both are contacted by a mysterious woman, via cellphone, and diabolically manipulated into getting together for a trip from Chicago to Washington, DC. Along the way, the audience is thinking (or, at least, I was): are they being set up to look like Lee Harvey Oswald-types? And, if so, by whom? Middle Eastern cyber-terrorists? Or, an ultra-right wing branch of the Department of Defense?It soon turns out that the mastermind is A.R.I.A., ""herself!"" Which, in turn, changes the earlier questions to: why is ""she"" doing this? And, how they can stop an artificial intelligence that can eavesdrop on almost anyone from anywhere?This movie had me even more on the edge of my seat than last week's TRAITOR. To go from psychological thriller to s.f. fable in literally the blink of an eye is a highly original plot-twist that I did not see coming, at all. And, I find that refreshing in a day-and-age where cinematic originality is becoming more and more of a contradiction in terms!Billy Bob Thornton is equally refreshing as FBI Special Agent Thomas Morgan. This is the only other one of his movies I have ever seen since SLING BLADE. All his flicks in between, I've avoided like the plague! Which ought to tell you, in itself, just how much I enjoyed this!! If you want to know _why_ A.R.I.A. goes nutsy/cuckoo/haywire, you'll just have to go see the movie, yourselves.

80,vostf,Actors pushed around in a high-tech conspiracy,5,1 October 2012,"This is the kind of movie that only works on one level: set a high level of action, spin the wheel - with actors in the middle - and keep delivering until conclusion. So it's satisfactory as a pop-corn movie, but I guess the premise for action here was supposed to be more than a nice high-tech pretence.The result is the main characters are in passive mode all along, it is more like an old video game where you have to complete level after level. That makes them not very interesting if you see through the heavy context that is supposed to make for the flimsiness of the boring common good-at-heart people roles of LaBeouf and Monaghan. They have no purpose except going with the flow, and are they really better people afterwards? No, they just happen to make it through.Actually the problem with this ""high"" concept is that high-tech drowns human characters so at some point it irremediably verges on fantasy or sci-fi. And it requires to come up with a whole backstory àla Matrix, but here they only went for the straight actioneer. On the other hand Michael Bay had his only flop when he tried to go beyond dumb all-out action with The Island, so you couldn't expect journeyman DJ Caruso to even think of some original execution.",Eagle Eye
81,RJBurke1942,"Where they're watching you, always watching you",5,6 January 2012,"I generally like movies with Billy Bob Thornton. This movie is not one of them, although Billy Bob prances about as only he can do.As movies go – and this one does go real fast – it has all the mindless action, plot twists, fantastic situations and improbable premises to suit its target audience. I didn't count them but I think this story now must rank second as the movie with the most car crashes (I think The Blues Brothers is still in first place), even surpassing the efforts of Jason Bourne of the Bourne trilogy.No matter: it's still all good fun, great CGI, almost-lightning fast in its pacing, and totally unbelievable. But, what the hey, it's viscerally invigorating to see an average guy, Jerry (Shia La Boeuf) and gal, Rachel (Michelle Monaghan) get thrown together by an unknown, unseen manipulator and forced to do a job together – or die. No, this is not Saw 15 or whatever...Instead, it's just an excuse to present a story that is in fact analogous to what is happening in major democracies (and other less inviting governments) around the world: the USA, the UK, Europe, and parts of Asia and Australasia. If you haven't noticed, the masses of the world are, increasingly being watched, monitored, videoed, recorded, categorized and analyzed. And all in the name of national security.Other movies have done it better, the most recently obvious are the aforesaid Bourne trio. But, you'll no doubt recall the Terminator series with the malevolent Skynet as the computer-controlling overlord of the masses. How can we forget 1984 (1952, 1984) where Big Brother is on every TV screen? Go back further to 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) where a diabolical computer system runs amok – so to speak – with disastrous results (there are scenes in EE that parody crucial scenes in 2001). Or, watch a much under-rated The End of Violence (1997). You get the picture? So while this story is just totally unbelievable fun to watch, next time you go out to shop, just count the number of video cameras you see in your travels – cameras that capture your every move as you walk into the frame. And, even if there is No Such Agency (aka NSA), think about what a fully integrated agency could do if there were absolutely no controls on its procedures and processes.In the meantime, have a few laughs as you see Jerry and Rachel – in the frame and being framed – turn into a dynamic fighting duo (shades of Batman and Catwoman) and gasp as you watch cars, trucks and planes turn into minced metal without much letup. Give it five for effort and furiously frenetic editing.Now – I wonder when the video game will be released.January 6, 2012",Eagle Eye
82,innocuous,Absolutely unoriginal and unbelievable.,4,29 December 2008,"I gave EE four stars only because the action sequences are not too bad and because SLB does OK in his role. The film DOES look nice and can get exciting.But it fails the ""Sprinkler Test."" (Ebert looks for the ""clang"" moments in a movie, when the movie has simply stretched your willingness to believe to the point where it snaps. In a similar way, I have the ""Sprinkler Test."") In fact, EE fails the test twice. For anyone who does not already know this, standard fire sprinkler heads operate independently and are individually activated by a heat source near the head. The heat either boils some fluid sealed in a glass vial or melts some metal/compound that releases a plug and allows water to spray from the head. They don't all go off at once. In fact, you don't WANT them all to go off at once, as you probably won't have enough water pressure and flow available to make any of them effective. So, not only does EE have sprinkler heads going off simultaneously throughout a building, but it has them activated through remote control over the Internet. Clang!! I could write for hours about the technical (and logical) problems in this film, but it would be a waste. Some reviewers have stated that you have to be willing to ""go with it"" and suspend your disbelief. Sorry...can't do it. I'm betting that these reviewers only picked up a few of the ""howlers"" in EE and think that the other technical points and plot devices are, in some way, actually possible. When the count begins to get into the double-digits, and even into the triple-digits, that movie simply can't be considered good entertainment.

It's all based on this action. By the end of the film, when the action stops, and the storyline climaxes, everything falls apart. And this is disappointing.

So I went to see this movie without really knowing what this movie is all actually about. After having seen it I must say it was entertaining but in a very ordinary way that doesn’t quite live up to the money I pay to watch it.Tell the truth I really getting tired of all these genre of movie where someone is track down by the government using hi-tech technology. You know something Enemy of the State; yeah this movie is like that but better techno and much more boring storyline.The weak point of this movie got to be its story that doesn’t very much intrigue. It was not boring don’t get me wrong but it was just plain and very thin story that doesn’t seem to put much thought into it. Sure there is action from time to time but nothing really an eye catcher and what up with Billy Bob character?? totally underdeveloped.Great cast by the way, but unfortunately I think everyone of them is like underuse. They can definitely get more from these actors. Apart from that they are pretty alright.What disappoint me might be because of it wasn’t live to my expectation; it wasn’t as clever as I expected it to be. It was just a plain action movie. Overall I’m a little disappointed by it since I have seen this type of movie too many time and almost none of it really do the trick including this.Recommendation: Sure, it was fun for the first timer.

A super computer that seems to instantly overcome any security system anywhere, including airports, the Police, utility companies and the FBI would not need a human to overcome a security protocol. 2. Identical twins do not share bio-metrics or voice patterns. 3. Since the exploding crystal and trigger were going to get to where the president was, what was the need to the twins bio-metrics anyway? 4.

87,LazySod,Highly far fetched but fun anyway,7,20 October 2008,"Eagle Eye is a typical run of the mill action film where an idea for a possible plot is found and reality is changed to fit around that plot. No matter how much effort it takes to make up a working ""reality"" it can still turn into a rather amusing film and in this case it worked out - but only barely enough to make it worthy of cinema time.It all starts when a guy comes home from a funeral and finds his room filled with enough explosives and material to plan a major terrorist attack. His phone rings and a mysterious voice tells him what to do and tells him that he'll end up in a lot of trouble if he doesn't do what the voice is telling him.The story then jumps to a young woman that is running into a similarly serious problem. She is also commanded to do something and from there things start of really quickly and the pace of the action is set - a nicely fast roller-coaster through more and more action and further and further fetched plot sequences.As a film this one doesn't work out very good, but it is good enough to attract people and to amuse them during its running time. I'd not suggest it to anyone really, but for people that liked Die Hard 4 (which is equally far fetched) this one might work out rather well.7 out of 10 strangers on the phone",Eagle Eye

90,Shattered_Wake,It's an action thriller - It serves both of those genres,7,31 December 2008,"While 'Eagle Eye' may not be the next great action flick or thriller, it's a good combination that adequately serves both of those areas. From start to finish, the film manages to maintain a steady pace that never lets you up for breath. Yes, the plot is absolutely ridiculous, but since when do action flicks ever have realistic plots? John McClain was a normal cop who singlehandedly took down a whole gang of terrorists. Four times. Here, you have an average guy (well, above-average in intelligence it seems) teamed with an average woman (only looking out for the well being of her son) . . . but their power lies with the fact that they always remain one step ahead of those tailing them.It works and it works well. It's a fun, thrilling ride.

93,diac228,"""We know all about you Jerry Shaw. And yes, Even Stevens was a stupid show""",8,6 October 2008,"(The previous quote was not said in the movie, but I needed to get your attention somehow) This review might be monitored, so I better give this a good review. After the surprise major success of Rear Window, er, I mean, Disturbia, D.J. Caruso and Shia LaBeouf are teaming up yet again to create another movie with Hitchcock elements. This time however, the borrowing extends from Hitchcock to Spielberg, Tony Scott, Stanley Kubrick, and more. This is definitely a movie you have seen before, definitely containing themes that we've seen time and time again, but that doesn't take away from the fact that this is one heck of a thrill ride. Using an idea that Spielberg created, Caruso directs a high-pulse, tense ride that spans a good portion of the United States. Thanks to the supervision and guidance of Spielberg, Eagle Eye is able to rise above expectations and provide a good blend of suspense, drama, mystery, and action. However, unlike the fourth Indiana Jones, this film actually contains a plausible explanation for all the insanity that is happening to the main characters and everyone else involved. Sadly though, there is one element in the movie that prevents it from being among the best thrillers out there.Eagle Eye is about two people that don't know each other (LeBeouf and Michelle Monaghan) that are suddenly forced to receive orders from a mysterious woman over the phone in order to remain living. Things get stranger and scarier when the female seems to be able to manipulate everything involving technology to help (or harm) whomever she pleases. In the meantime, the two strangers are being chased around the country by federal agents. It's a wild goose chase that doesn't slow down nor contains a path of where its going. We can thank the creative writing staff for this (Spielberg idea, Dan McDermott story, four writers in total), as they throw away any chance of character development and replace it with barrage after barrage of foot/car chases, revelations, plot twists, and surprises. Like previously stated, it ""borrows"" plenty from Enemy of the State, 2001, I, Robot, North By Northwest; but this doesn't mean Eagle Eye is a highly-predicable flick.Strong acting is required to keep you wanting to root for the victims throughout the entire ordeal. Luckily for Caruso and Dreamworks, LeBeouf and Monaghan do a superb job in their roles, adding extra spice to their characters as they scramble around taking orders with plenty of resistance multiple times. Rosario Dawson, Billy Bob Thornton, and Michael Chikilis have smaller roles but also do a decent job with the material they are presented with. D.J. Caruso does a swell job in blending the scenes together and maintaining the frantic pacing. He's evolved a lot since ""Taking Lives."" The strongest parts of this movie are the intense and utterly insane action scenes and chases that erupt a few times here and there. The CGI is absolutely incredible and believable throughout because it wasn't overused and wasn't crafted on such an epic scale, it reveals itself to be fake. The explosions, car crashes and debris flying about is seen all over the place and quite frankly leaves you gasping for air. If its not the action leaving you breathless, it's the cinematography that will leave you sick; the trend of shaking the camera relentlessly in order to heighten the tension is quite overused this time around. Perfected in The Bourne Ultimatum, there are instances in which you can barely make out what's happening, and there are other times in which a headache is emerging inside your brain (the switching from darkness to bright lights is just plain cruel).Like any suspenseful movie involving cyber terrorism and/or fears of progress of technology, there are instances in which you have to shut off your brain and just enjoy the ride. A good portion of the conflicts could have been solved if the higher-class soldiers and agents of the United States weren't so gullible and stupid. Another interesting thing to note is that the two main characters are pretty strong and dangerous despite not having any actual military and/or hand-to-hand combat training. But, this is just me being nit-picky. Eagle Eyes' main drawback is that it has to follow the footsteps of The Bourne Ultimatum, one of the slickist, smartest, and best action thrillers in decades. Don't let that statement bring you down though, because Eagle Eye is well worth your money, as it delivers the thrills that most 2008 summer movies were severely lacking. We are seeing good material from rising stars LeBeouf, the underrated Monaghan, and director (and seemingly student of Spielberg/Hitchcock) D.J. Caruso.Bottom Line: An intense thriller from start to finish, Eagle Eye is a summer blockbuster at heart with plenty of action, suspense, and doused off with modern-day themes that are highly-prevalent. While this failed to become the next Jaws or Psycho in terms of subtlety crafting a new phobia, you may leave the theater being a bit wary of your surroundings for a bit. Shut the brain off on certain scenes, leave them open for the information-overload scenes, and prepare to engage in an edgy journey that will you blow you away when everything on screen is blowing up. In a season full of Oscar-winner wanna-bes, we have a film with exciting leftover summer flavor.P.S.

The whole computer made for ultimate protection or whatever, that is way too smart and turns evil and starts killing us made me roll my eyes pretty hard. But it was still fun because it definitely added a little bit of a spin on that type of backstory by focusing more on innocent people who have no idea what's going on. I've always enjoyed watching LaBeouf act and this is no exception. I've also always enjoyed watching Michelle Monaghan be ridiculous attractive, so the fact that she's a good actress is just gravy for me.

95,johnnymacbest,First impressions.,6,23 September 2008,"Eagle Eye starts off very interestingly but sadly falters in it's execution and that's mainly due to the poor structure of the plot and script. The major players seem capable of their parts but the acting seems like an afterthought (other than Monaghan) and it's primarily the director's fault and the producers NOT the actors as some are led to believe. Shia Lebeouf, whose recent repertoire of films has earned him box office millions and a household name gives a forced, uninspired, underwhelming performance as the man on the run from government agents out to kill him for the secret that he possesses but Rachael Holloman (a fitting last name for the entire screenplay let alone acting) played by Michelle Monaghan (the only believable character in ""EE"") comes to his rescue and hijinks ensue with impressive stunts; especially the conveyor belt chase, arguably the most original and ingenious action set piece and one of the most memorable scenes in the film. Ultimately, despite an impressive cast of amazing actors/actresses the entire picture feels so disjointed and similar like so many other recent stereotypical Hollywood spy thrillers that passing this up is not a crime whatsoever regardless of it's aspirations. No doubt many die- hard fans will see this film just for Shia Lebeouf but for everything else there's just nothing really new here. In short, wasted potential.",Eagle Eye

98,kgprophet,Twist in middle made me want to walk out.,3,26 September 2008,"I saw the bad reviews but the appealing trailer before I decided to see this film. For the first hour or so, there is a well made thriller skillfully handled by Shia LaBeouf and director D.J. Caruso. Many movies that need to spend a good half hour of setup bore audiences to death with unimaginative claptrap. I was thinking that how could this movie go so wrong with such a competent first act? Some kind of terrorist act is going to occur, and it looks like our hero and heroine are being setup as patsies. No one is expecting this action oriented film to be intriguing with any great depth, like ""National Treasure"" or something, it's just popcorn fun.So what, if it amply borrows from films like ""Enemy of the State"", or the ""Bourne"" franchise, if it offers some good set pieces, then all is good. Judging by the budget of this film, my guess was that they originally intended to release this film as a tent pole during the summer. Obviously, it tanked during test screenings, and the fundamental (and openly laughable) flaw cannot be removed. I talk about the twist in the middle of the film that reveals who the voice on the phone is. It was so silly that I had the urge to just walk up and leave, something I almost never do.It was a shame, because up to that point, I was willing to follow along with the story, even with it's silly notion that any average citizen would turn into a Manchurian candidate and commit a whole series of crimes, knowing that they were helping out in a 9/11 type of terrorist act. It was especially a shame because Billy Bob Thornton comes across very well as a straight arrow in a script suffering from too many rewrites. From the moment we find out what is level 36 in the Pentagon, the IQ level of the movie plummeted to about the level of a 7 year old.Yes folks, the second half of the movie is off-the-wall goofy bad. My thinking as I started to alternate from laughing and groaning was that this film would have been much better rewritten as an over-the-top James Bond type of movie, with the silly super villain owning an unrealistic super weapon. I'm sure other reviews may give away this major plot point so the next paragraph will address this: **Major Spoilers** When it is revealed the ""Eagle Eye"" is another Skynet from ""Terminator"", a stoopid set is built, complete with a giant ""HAL 9000"" camera eye. And they couldn't just stop with a fancy looking computer center, no, we get a wall of golden balls that make no sense at all, along with waterfalls and pools, no I'm not kidding. With this premise taking us to the big finale, I lost complete interest in what happened to who. Now instead of giving the film a pass on the idea computers can predict human behaviour down to braking or speeding through a stoplight, I guffawed at the preposterous overly slick action sequences.**End Spoilers** I suggest you wait to rent this as a DVD to fall asleep to, and maybe get a kick at how many cars fly through the air in the plentiful action scenes.

While everyone knows that his horrible film, Disturbia, was a blatant rip off of Rear Window, many do not that this movie is almost as blatant but Caruso manages to rip off more than one movie this time. There are strong elements of Hitchcock's films, North by Northwest and The Wrong Man. It also borrows from Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange, but mostly, 2001: A Space Odyssey. This movie is nothing but an unoriginal piece of Hollywood trash with some okay suspense and a load of bad product placement.I didn't really have a problem with the acting.

Clearly touted to be this decade's ""Enemy of the State"", but unfortunately does not reach that high, the film tells of how a slacker (LaBeouf) and a single mother (Monaghan), are mistaken as terrorists and forced to obey a mysterious woman's orders while being pursued by two agents (Rosario Dawson and Billy Bob Thornton), who discover that there is something else going on.While the plot may be an indirect rip-off of EOTS, it is still what makes the movie interesting. Although the sci-fi plot uncorked at the middle of the film makes this film lose a star. It went too far with that there. Other than that, the screenplay was okay, besides the admittedly cheesy ending of the film. The paranoia is still there, and is still haunting no matter what you think in this post 9/11 world.The actors do an okay job. Shia, who delivers one-liners, even at a critical situation, has the ""X"" factor, no doubt, and I see a bright future for him. As if being groomed by Spielberg to be the next Tom Hanks wasn't enough, so far three films in which he leads opened at #1 at the box office. Not good enough yet? Shia can add ""action hero"" to his resume. Michelle Monaghan also gives quite a strong performance, a single mother risking everything to protect her child. Her performance is what I think one of the better aspects of the movie. Dawson and Thornton also could do you no harm.The action sequences are solid, albeit unrealistic a bit. Here we have massive car pileups, dangling electric cables, and a tunnel chase that echoes last year's ""Live Free or Die Hard"", among others. It's fast, frantic and implausible, which is a mixed bag. It's obvious that director Caruso tried the ""Michael Bay"" approach, so there is no comment there, as Michael Bay aims to entertain. I think Bay can find a successor in Caruso.So, it's not that realistic, and definitely not in par with ""Enemy of the State"", but it is still very entertaining, and a solid action movie. A good movie to watch in the cinemas.Entertainment value: 8.5/10Overall Value: 6.6/10Delton",Eagle Eye
101,gary-444,Strangely Unsatisfying,7,29 October 2008,"The raw ingredients are here, a very good story, Spielberg,a big budget and a decent cast. Somewhere along the line though the total fails to represent the sum of the parts.As a brainless blockbuster/ thriller it is competent enough. I think that the frustration is that it should have been more.The trailer, whilst engaging, does not do justice to the plot.In summary an ""innocent"" man and woman, both strangers to each other, find themselves hijacked by an omniscient and omnipresent security system and are forced to do its will. Briefly it touches on some interesting points.A surveillance society is open to abuse.Remote control warfare is fallible, and how do a State's people deal with an Executive that is out of control? These cerebral issues are however subsumed by a barrage of explosions, chases, and techno mumbo jumbo which end up getting in the way.There are some decent set piece action sequences.Yet less money spent on them, and more devoted to the nuances of the plot would have paid dividends.The almost 2 hour running time spends far too much time cuing up the next lavish ""set"" and too little time creating dramatic tension. ""You want tension? Here's another explosion!"" The leads are pretty anodyne.Shia Laboeuf, as Jerry Shaw,plays the part with the looks, and commitment, of a male model not wanting to get his hair dirty.Whilst Michelle Monaghan,as Rachel Hollman,starts off looking stunned that she is caught up in this caper, then continues looking the same throughout.In the supporting roles however there are some Stirling performances which save the picture from disaster.In summary, there is no excuse for this film not being better than it turned out.",Eagle Eye
102,barrys82,A thriller worth to see,9,27 September 2008,"Eagle Eye was a very good thrilling movie. A film like and adrenaline shot from the beginning to the end. You really can feel the tension during its two hour length. It is full of suspense, mystery, action and adventure. The story is interesting, although at some moments it was hard to believe. I like how they manage the human manipulation, the loss of privacy, the violation of your rights and how the technology no matter how useful it is, it can be used to harm and destroy. The cast is really great, Shia Labeouf performance was great, he is proving that he is a great actor for any kind of movie. Michelle Monaghan was very good too doing a very convincing acting job. The secondary roles of Billy Bob Thornton and Rosario Dawson are excellent and give a very good support to the movie and to the leading actors. In conclusion, it is a enjoyable and entertaining movie. A mind blowing thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Highly recommended.",Eagle Eye
103,TheMarwood,"Big, dumb and entertaining",6,1 July 2014,"Jerry Shaw is nothing like his recently deceased prodigy of a twin brother, who worked high up in a mysterious program in the military - nothing like him at all. We get a character who is overwritten about being irresponsible, like working in a photocopy store, but underwritten as a human being. Shia LaBeouf does a decent job filling in the blanks of this character, who on the written page really could have been played by anyone of either gender or any age, as Jerry Shaw is written basically as a human prop thrown into an absurd series of action scenes. Michelle Monaghan also makes the most of her character, who's depth begins and ends with her love for her young son. This ridiculously silly material gets going when an absurd amount of weapons and explosives show up at his small apartment, which his old landlady who must have incredible strength, brings them all into his apartment. Jerry is immediately apprehended by the FBI, who swoop in the most theatrical and dramatic way, crashing through windows and blowing through the side of his apartment, which seems hilariously illogical considering the amount of explosives in this small room. Jerry is then interrogated by the ever serious Billy Bob Thornton, in a one dimensional paycheck role and soon after finds himself teamed up with Michelle Monaghan on the run with the help of a mysterious woman who has control over everything electronic. Director D.J Caruso keeps things moving at a breakneck pace, while making sure things like logic and intelligence remain as far away from these events as possible. But that's hardly a complaint for a film that doesn't contain a frame of pretension and just wants to entertain, even at the expense of your brain. Eagle Eye is well made hokum.",Eagle Eye
104,flingebunt,Boring stupid turd of a movie,3,29 December 2011,"A computer system, named Eagle Eye, decides to do some things that involve recruiting 2 seemingly ordinary people. Car chases, shoot outs, jumps off tall buildings, more chases, tough nosed FBI agents etc etc.Look I can handle suspension of disbelief but this movie is both boring and stupid. The main tension you get when watching this movie is wondering if there are actually going to be any interesting plot twists or ideas explored or will they stand on the train tracks and let the train run over them.1. They have a computer system that can control things...great...why not put some limits on that system, I mean they did that in Die Hard 4 (and that is a movie where Bruce Willis shot down a helicopter with a car).2. Was the computer right or wrong. That was the only possible interesting part of the movie. But they just ignored the whole thing. The computer represents the legal system of the united states, which invokes the whole idea of Magna Carta and the fact that they king is not above the law, but that is ignored.Anyway ignore this movie unless you are really bored.",Eagle Eye
105,kermitkid,Edge of your seat non stop action,9,31 March 2020,"What a fantastic thriller this was! It was an edge-of-your-seat film that was exciting from beginning to end. Some elements were a little far fetched, but for the most part I enjoyed it. I loved the build up of the first half that was paid off by an even better second half. It really was food for thought about government surveillance and technology. I was not bored once! This is probably one of the best thrillers I have ever seen. I know the film is 10 years old, but no matter how old a film is, spoilers are still spoilers. That's why I'm being vague. I'm trying not to give too much away, because this is a film you want to go into knowing as little as possible. This was Mission: Impossible mixed with Minority Report. (which makes me wonder why Tom Cruise wasn't cast in this one as well.) Not that I didn't enjoy Shia LeBouf, but it seemed like he was channeling Cruise from those films. Despite its problems, of which there are few, I highly recommend it!

106,nicolechan916,A well crafted story with great action and acting.,7,9 October 2015,"The film is well crafted and the narrative style complements the story. As the audience is also somewhat left in the dark as to what is happening, it helps us engage more into the lives of the characters of Shaw and Holloway. This makes the audience sympathize with them, since we get quite a bit of background information from both, and they connect through necessity. LaBeouf and Monaghan do a good job with their characters. LaBeouf plays both Jerry Shaw and the twin, and I guess there is a bit of distinction between the two characters. We don't see enough of the twin, but he did sufficiently well in separating the personality of the two characters. Monaghan plays the worried and loving mother well, though this gender stereotype with the woman having the child, and the man being a lone wolf is getting tiresome. The action and visual effects are great in this. The movie is quite fast-paced and slows at times, but is overall very engaging. The chase scenes are exciting and some even nerve-wrecking. Cinematography and editing make these scenes more intense, as for example, we are in the car when a crash happens which gives the impression that we are in the crash and makes us tense up. The story is pretty original, putting a little twist in the rise and fall of humanity and the relationship with technology. However, there is some ideological patriotism going on, and I guess they needed the military input to generate the story, but it could be done differently too. This just makes it another movie about saving the country, i.e. America.Overall, an exciting film with great action, acting and a intriguing story.

107,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,A summer blockbuster at heart...just sit back and enjoy the incredibly unrealistic ride,7,25 September 2008,"Ah, the seemingly perfect combination of Steven Spielberg, director D.J. Caruso, and everyman leading star Shia LaBeouf. These guys took us by storm with the pleasant surprise Disturbia last year, and pretty much anything with the name Spielberg on it has to be at least entertaining, if not excellent. That's what Eagle Eye is.First off, I cannot stress this enough: don't take this movie seriously. Please don't get mad because the movie isn't realistic. I know it's unrealistic. You know it. Shia LaBeouf knows it. That doesn't stop Eagle Eye from being one of the most entertaining and effective thrillers of recent memory. Is it as smart or as gripping as other chase and mystery thrillers such as the Bourne series? Of course not. However, whenever Eagle Eye stretches our minds to the breaking limits with the insanity on screen, it manages to throw in a mind boggling action sequence or two right as we start to get mad.The film, very well masked by trailers that really only show the beginning of the film and small pieces of the end, deals with cyber-terrorism and a secret military project dealing with destruction and national security. The US Secretary of Defense is portrayed (Michael Chiklis), it's incredibly unrealistic, has Shia LaBeouf, and has a prominent military character (Anthony Mackie). I can already here the Transformers comparisons flying in. The film also lacks in the originality department elsewhere, as elements of I, Robot and Live Free or Die Hard are also present and quite obvious.I cannot give enough accolades to whoever thought up this action - Eagle Eye boasts arguably the best action sequences of the year. The CGI is seamless and more than worthy of an Oscar nomination. With car chases to rival the best of them, as well as one of the most clever ""on-foot"" chases I've ever seen within an airport, Eagle Eye never fails to grab your attention with the incredible action sequences.Now to our cast, the headliners of which are two of film's biggest rising stars. Both live up to their names and reputations admirably. Shia LaBeouf revisits the ""troubled youth"" character he created in Disturbia, though his turn here is darker and has more depth. He really stretches some acting muscle in the beginning of the film, and it is because of this early success that we are willing to go along for the ride with him, following, trusting, and believing in his Jerry Shaw. Michelle Monaghan, long one of the most underrated in the business, also helps us believe in her character with a convincing show of emotion early in the film. The whole film, despite the action sequences, rides on the shoulders of the leads. If the audience doesn't like them, the film will ultimately fail. I'm pleased to tell you that they rise to the occasion and carry the film with ease.Our supporting cast includes veterans Billy Bob Thornton and Michael Chiklis. Maybe it was the script, but Thornton's character was so stereotypical and overdone that it almost made him laughable - especially towards the end. Chiklis did great in his role as the Secretary of Defense - and the unfortunate ""victim"" of circumstance. Rosario Dawson and Anthony Mackie are acceptable in even smaller roles.I remember when I watched my first D.J. Caruso film a few years ago (Two For the Money), and I remember how much I hated that film. However, Caruso has certainly grown as a filmmaker and has found his niche in the hugely entertaining action blockbuster genre, even if a lot of ""movie borrowing"" is done. This will be his breakthrough that will allow him a little more freedom as a filmmaker and possibly allow him to blossom into more than just an action film director. The touches of Spielberg are obvious, as the legendary director/producer's presence is only a plus.Eagle Eye, in short, is a summer blockbuster released in September. It feels like a summer film, and has the components of a summer film: explosions, terrorism, and Shia LaBeouf. It is everything you want in an entertaining action thriller. Don't go looking for your super realistic epic here - Eagle Eye prides itself on blowing your mind every way possible.",Eagle Eye
108,Jay_Exiomo,Preposterous to the point of silliness,4,25 September 2008,"Director D.J. Caruso and Shia Labeouf of last year's ""Disturbia"" team up once again in ""Eagle Eye"" - a slick sci-fi thriller on the horrors of a quasi-Orwellian society that suggests why it might be better living off the grid.LaBeouf plays Jerry Shaw, a young man who finds himself framed for terrorism shortly after returning from the funeral of his twin brother Ethan (also LaBeouf), who supposedly died of an accident. Shortly thereafter, a mysterious voice calls giving him instructions regarding his next steps on how to evade the FBI hot on his trail, and setting him up to meet with Rachel Holloman (Michelle Monaghan), a single mom also held hostage by the mysterious voice. They soon find out that they've unwittingly become a part of a big threat on American security.While last year's aforementioned ""Disturbia"" blatantly borrowed elements from Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"", it didn't matter since it turned out to be a taut and gripping old-fashioned thriller effectively exploiting the subject of voyeurism. ""Eagle Eye"" yet again liberally copies from other films tackling the invasion of privacy, and for the first hour or so it gives a glimmer of hope that the film will be good, if not entirely intelligent. But Caruso and the team of screenwriters squander any such potential, lazily settling for a formulaic and predictable thriller that ultimately reveals itself to be so preposterous it's funny.The cast do their best to shine through a weak material, especially LaBeouf who gives an effective portrayal of paranoia to his character; his chemistry with Monaghan is suspect, though. A slightly underused Billy Bob Thornton as the hard-ass FBI agent is as usual fun to watch.""Eagle Eye"" ultimately feels like a misplaced summer movie in late September. ""How about you give me paper, like in the old times?"" yells Thornton at one point in the movie when he's struggling with a piece of an advanced technology. Or something like that. The film itself could have used less techno-babble and opted for a relatively low-key thriller. But apparently with greater budget come greater car chase scenes, bigger explosions, a more preposterous plot and a higher suspension of disbelief.",Eagle Eye
109,shadowman123,Seriously lacking in something,7,18 December 2008,"From the trailers Eagle Eye looked like a fast paced thriller , with lots of action sequences and thrills along the way. However unfortunalelty although the plot seems cleverly thought out , the half baked acting makes the movie well uninteresting and rather disjointed. If you put the acting to one side then you are actually left with a very interesting plot and the action sequence ARE good but it just felt that the actors were not very convincing and that they were just doing it for well the sake of it.

This leads to a very good movie I would definitely recommend to any movie goer.Anyway, Shia Labeouf is very good in this film and helps hold it together with Billy Bob Thornten, who, I must admit actually did a good job in this film.Overall, I think this film is a good watch and a good movie to watch with friends.

Threatening their lives and family, she pushes Jerry and Rachel into a series of increasingly intense and deadly situations by the help of using the technology of everyday life to track and control their every move.Fast, exciting and bold from start to finish, Eagle Eye creates suspense and nail biting tension all along, making the audience sit right on the edge of their seats. The two leads do a fantastic job by showing how talented they are by acting to a very serious degree. D.J.

To my surprise, it turned out to be science fiction, and pretty effective SF at that.Young slacker Jerry Shaw (Shia LaBoeuf) and single mom Rachel Holloman (Michelle Monaghan) are being psychologically manipulated by an imperious woman who orders them around over whatever phone happens to be handy, giving them seemingly impossible tasks requiring split-second timing for no obvious purpose. I seldom appreciate the cinematic technique of frenzied, blurred, jumbled cuts of hard-to-follow high-speed action, but here they're used to good effect as the protagonists are rushed from one crisis to another way too fast to figure out what's going on. Their confusion and panic becomes yours. All they know is that they must obey or die.Billy Bob Thornton and Rosario Dawson are investigators who start out suspecting our heroes of terrorism but gradually figure out that everyone's being jerked around by the mysterious Aria.

Caruso with Steven Spielberg come up with a second feature movie. This is bigger, more intense and more action than disturbia. D.J. Caruso proves that he can create a more intense movie with cars exploding with a bigger budget. Eagle Eye is intense and thrilling but the story is a bit weird and simple.The story: The story is not original as we probably heard this kind of stories before. Though it is not original, I like it for its thrills and suspense. I have seen better action than in this. The plot- Shia plays Jerry Shaw in the movie who is following orders from an unknown caller. Rachel Holloman (Michelle Monaghan) is involved in the insane orders. They start running, going from one place and other and collect stuffs. There is exploding action in between. There is a mild twist added- the caller. For an intense action movie, it is good. But if I consider it for its plot, it is just mildly interesting.Overall: If you have seen disturbia, you might want to catch the director's second feature. You want intense movies, here is one.

That is where my compliments end. There was a 10 minute (maybe it was only 5; felt like 10) car chase scene, at night, with siren lights and maybe it was even raining, or seemed like it, but it was a mess. Headache inducing and confusing. Just bad editing and camerawork. Shaky cam during a chase scene? Come on. More of that to come later. Not to mention the melodramatic script, and redundant scenes involving something as trivial and cliché as ""his twin brother was a great man, but this guy is a loser.""

117,mr_popcorn,Eagle Eye,7,29 September 2008,"Jerry Shaw: (shouting) ""Are you the one who called me on the phone?""Rachel Holloman: ""She called you too?"" 'Eagle Eye' is a race-against-time thriller starring Shia LaBeouf, Michelle Monaghan, Rosario Dawson, Anthony Mackie and Billy Bob Thornton. Jerry Shaw (LaBeouf) and Rachel Holloman (Monaghan) are two strangers thrown together by a mysterious phone call from a woman they have never met. Threatening their lives and family, she pushes Jerry and Rachel into a series of increasingly dangerous situations--using the technology of everyday life to track and control their every move. As the situation escalates, these two ordinary people become the country's most wanted fugitives, who must work together to discover what is really happening--and more importantly, why.A highly entertaining popcorn flick thrill ride that doesn't stop from start to finish. The movie kind of starts slow, introducing the main characters Jerry (Shia) and Rachel (Michelle) and a bit of story development from each character but then the minute Shia's character is arrested by the FBI under false pretenses, the movie kicks into overdrive and the adrenaline rush doesn't stop until it ends. Eagle Eye is a prime example of a highly budgeted studio popcorn flick with big explosions and eye popping car chase sequences. Michael Bay should be proud.The plot is somehow far fetched and implausible which makes this kind of a science fiction in its kind and so far, this has been one of the better science fiction I have seen but its no 'Blade Runner'. Pure mindless, adrenaline, over-the-top sci-fi thriller fun, and I liked it...a lot.The goal of the film, besides giving us virtual adrenaline rush in high doses is, they want us, the audience to fear our cellphones and computers and hoped that after watching it, we would never ever touch a single technological gadget in our lives. Just like what Spielberg did when he made 'Jaws'. When people saw the film, they thought twice in getting in a sailboat and heading out to open seas. It could have worked, it might not but if you ask me, I'm still not afraid of my BlackBerry. I love my BlackBerry. But that's just me.Shia LaBeouf who is clearly making his way into bankable lead actor status is improving in every film that I see him in. He's one of those actors you might want to watch out for. Brad Pitt, George Clooney and Will Smith should watch their backs, there's a new kid in town. Michelle Monaghan, on the other hand, is an actress that I am totally a fan. I first noticed her in 2005's underrated film ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" then her follow-up ""Mission Impossible III"" as Tom Cruise's flame. This lady delivers all the goods when it is needed, that's why she's one of my favorite actresses out there.The plot of Eagle Eye may have been used a lot of times, I can see some striking similarities with 2004's I,Robot and Kubrick's sci-fi masterpiece ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" but this one I highly enjoyed and I was impressed actually.

118,honorhorror,clichéd but it's good on its own.,7,15 June 2009,"Eagle eye could be very good if you manage to tackle all the familiar parts and those predictable moments. And the finest reason for a viewing should be its production value.The production value of it surpasses most 2008 titles within the same genre, namely, sci-fi, thriller and action. The action sequences, although not groundbreaking, are superbly done and frankly, easier to apprehend than The Dark Knight, which also focused on chasing sequences.The story is the main drawback, sadly being clichéd and more alike a hybrid of Metal Gear Solid and The Man Who Knew Too Much. The prior involved self-aware computer's political conspiracy, while the latter involved an ordinary couple being caught up in the middle of some conspiracy. Before I saw it, I was already warned by others about this. However, when I sit down and try not to focus too much on it, it shines in certain ways. Firstly, the leading guy Shia Laboef. I thought he's always the same little punk, like in Transformers and Disturbia. But this time he gave a pretty good performance, very emotional-driven and convincing. Secondly, the story goes quite fluently, due to the comfortable editing and pacing. There is no forced romance got in the way, no annoying characters stealing the show, only what's necessary on the screen.I didn't see it in theater mainly because I've been convinced it's too stereotypical to be a good drama/thriller. That should be attributed to the marketing. The trailer tried so hard to promise audiences with something they never saw, but gave them too low an expectation to see it. It was in a marketing dilemma as whether or not to reveal the sci-fi core of its story, and either way does this movie little favor.

We were watching it and kept saying, almost from the very beginning, ""Didn't we see this movie already?"" ""Yea, but I don't recall a kid, and I would have remembered a trumpet."" Or not. Same formula. Same plot sequence. Same, if not identical, car crashes and action (tractor trailer rolling over). Same dark scenes where you cannot see much, and the same mumbling we're seeing (not hearing!) more and more in movies.

Rachel Holloman is a divorced mother, who has just sent her child on a school trip to Washington. She receives a call saying if she doesn't do as instructed, then her son's train will be derailed...This movie combines bits of Wargames, Enemy Of The State, 1984 and even 2001, and comes up with something that while not the most original movie, certainly keeps moving. There are plenty of explosions, car chases, and stuff going on to keep you entertained.D.J. Caruso who directed last year's Disturbia, handles the material well, but if there is a weakness, it's that there is too much CGI involved in the action sequences. This does dilute the excitement during some of action, but doesn't hurt the movie too much.The 4 scriptwriters, have tried to come up with a conspiracy action thriller, but the results are a bit uneven. There is a good idea in the movie, but it's buried under the action.Shia LaBouf and Michelle Monaghan as Jerry and Rachel are pretty good, and are giving strong support from Billy Bob Thornton, Rosario Dawson and Micheal Chiklis amongst others.The movie is too long however.

Billy Bob Thornton and Rosario Dawson give pretty good supporting roles in this film too. i also think Shia and DJ Caruso work really well together in this plus Disturbia.the film after 10 minutes into it is a roller coaster of action and complexity which is an awesome combination. its a race against time explosion of a film that has a lot of originality. even though i said its quite original it does kinda resemble enemy of the state but cranks it up to the next level.this film is definitely one to watch if you haven't seen it yet, trust me you'll be amazed........ 9/10.......j.d Seaton",Eagle Eye

But the fall brings a welcome surprise, that being Eagle Eye. Shia once again shows he is more than able to handle acting in the midst of chaos. This go around he is showing some age, which is a good thing to see.The action is top notch. The plot falls into a cross between the original Matrix film (minus the whole ""one"" and all of the spiritual elements), Enemy of the State and any of the slew of films that have come out since that deal with our over dependence on technology due to the overwhelming desire to ""protect"" ourselves and the misuse of that technology, albeit this time the misuse in an accidental way.This is one of those films that you have to strap yourself in and hang on. No trips to the toilet, otherwise you will miss out. That may be the only knock against the film, it rarely takes a breath to give exposition, most times character development and story detail are thrown in the midst of all the explosions that you may miss it even if you don't get up. We never really learn a whole lot about any of the characters, but learn just enough to decide whether we give a damn what happens to them through all the explosions and chases.All in all, a fun ride that is solid.

This was shot in 2008, so naturally I expected the cheaper, on the go digital, possibly handheld style that was most commonly used around that time but this looks really nice. It's clearly shot on film and has a nice color scheme.The movie itself is a bit better than standard action fare as well. The writing is a little bit less shallow, although a lot of it is quite unbelievable, at least they make an attempt to flesh the characters out.To be honest, the suspense of disbelief is just... not there for me. This is like having god himself activate you as a spy, it's just completely ridiculous honestly. I guess that's the point though. But that doesn't make it an awful movie.An interesting artifact of post 9/11 paranoia though, released after the NSA's spying tactics on their own citizens was brought to light. The story is enough to keep me entertained even though half of that is due to laughing at the ridiculousness of it, and the times I'm starting to get bored I can just look at the gorgeous photography.

128,frankenbenz,Paranoia for Kids,5,6 December 2008,"Few shortcomings take an audience out of a movie more effectively than ridiculous implausibility. If you could rank ridiculous implausibility, D.J. Caruso's Eagle Eye would give Kingdom of the Crystal Skull a serious run for 2008's top spot. The blame of this epic fail falls squarely on the shoulders of the premise, which pits U.S. National Security against an omniscient supercomputer (named Eagle Eye) that possesses the uncanny ability to dictate and direct every move in every second of every one's life. To buy into this premise, you're asked to believe every single form of technology is hardwired into an accessible mainframe, all of which can be hacked and controlled from a remote location. Yes, even your Atari 2600.Once the supercomp gets it's chip set rankled by Washington's chain of command, it does what all computers with jacked up AI do: it hops aboard the HAL express. OK, maybe on paper this doesn't sound that ridiculous, but once the life of protagonist Jerry Shaw (Shia LeBouf) is turned upside down, plausibility takes a back seat to elaborate action sequence after elaborate action sequence, where survival relies on blind luck, not skill. In order for the computer's sinister master plan to be executed to perfection, these impossible odds of survival have to be defied over and over again, throughout the entire movie. You're probably asking: if Eagle Eye boasts gigaflops of processing power, then how come it can't calculate something as pedestrian as probability? Shhhh...don't ask questions the writer's either haven't considered themselves or were hoping you'd be too stupid to come up with on your own. What makes EE even less palatable than it's implausibility, are its ceaseless attempts to pass itself off as politically relevant, using the so-called War on Terror as its sinister back drop. By fanning the flames of fear, EE attempts to be taken seriously as not only a thrill ride, but as a political vehicle for current issues such as domestic spying, eroded civil liberties, wartime rules of engagement and so on. The makers of this movie must have gigantically swollen balls to hint at any credibility in the face of such overt ridiculousness.In addition to it's insulting exploitation of hot-button topics, Caruso also throws everything he can at the screen, making EE excessively loud, flashy, fast paced and crammed to the clouds with gadget porn and faux tech. In all fairness, perhaps keeping the short attention spans of audiences piqued is the only way to keep them from noticing how ridiculously stupid your movie actually is. So if a computer generated voice calls you on your cell phone and insists you go to a theater to see Eagle Eye...tell them you're deceased and hang up. It works for telemarketers, hopefully it works for bad movies.",Eagle Eye
129,jaddison383,"Accept and Enjoy, But Hope for Better",5,29 September 2008,"Eagle Eye marks yet another generic action film for Shia LaBeouf to add to his resume. Co-starring Michelle Monaghan, Billy Bob Thornton, and Rosario Dawson, Eagle Eye was presented by its trailers as some sort of psychological thriller. What we get is a paranoia-filled action film with very little in the way of plot, character, or depth. Yet, isn't that what action films are all about? Eagle Eye is saved by that knowledge for the most part. We can accept it for what it is, and enjoy it for its exciting and fun sequences, which are pretty much non-stop. Unfortunately, Eagle Eye goes on a good twenty minutes too long, and its main plot device grows quickly tiresome. By the time the film is resolved, you're quite relieved to be done. Eagle Eye is generally fun enough, just not the smart thriller it seemed it would be.But perhaps the biggest disappointment of Eagle Eye is the fact that LaBeouf is in it at all. I suppose if you want to remain a star for many years, it is smart to pick films that will be box office successes. Yet a scene of incredible vulnerability and anger coming from LaBeouf near the beginning makes us realize that he should be doing so much better work than this. 5/10 stars! Jay Addison",Eagle Eye

If they fail to comply, she warns them that they will die. As they try to do each task, the woman pushes them into more increasingly life-risking situations.The premise of this could be George Orwell's 1984 comes to the big screen. Eagle Eye raises some serious questions about how much security is too much, and it is interesting to speculate on what could happen to someone if information is leaked into the wrong hands. The feelings that producer Steven Spielberg wanted to create, according to star Shia Labeouf was he wanted viewers to sense paranoia about how powerful today's technology really is, and the amazing impact that it can have on our lives.The problem with Eagle Eye is that there are far too many running, chasing, jumping, and escape type sequences that go so fast from one scene to the next that you don't really get the time to identity with the main characters. There is so much rush to everything that the viewer does not get the seriousness of the message that Steven Spielberg and director DJ Caruso wanted. There are many unanswered questions in this movie. With constant chases, explosions, and Shia Labeouf and Michelle Monahagn running from scene to scene, there is perhaps three minutes of film where they, or any of the other characters, are able to talk about solutions to the problems and issues of security. The film shows SO MUCH, as if a great story about security impacting people's life's can be made fantastic with action sequences and special effects. The problem is, in the course of all the special effects, the director and producers got so caught up in the chase drama that they forgot to settle down and tell a story.Eagle Eye is a good movie. However, it is a little too over the top to be great.",Eagle Eye
131,tubby1,"Fast, quick but wrong time period.",6,11 October 2009,"Eagle Eye certainly has 'running time' the pace at which it moves is swift and unending. The plot is preposterous but it has an entertaining edge which makes it enjoyable. Shia Le Boeuf shows his lead capabilities and Thornton gives the film that little bit of credence.As the plot progresses we come across Aria an intelligent computer system that overrides human instructions due to its set purpose. I have no problem with Aria I find the use of such inventions as being a rather logical progression in technology (Space Odyssey, Sunshine, Minority Report). What damages the story more than anything is the contemporary setting. It is bizarre to even contemplate such artificial intelligence at this time let alone the sheer implausibility of its control.The plot of Eagle eye is rather enticing but as the story evolves it becomes rather less of a spectacle and more a chain of events with major plot holes. It should not be too harshly criticised if you can just enjoy the chase.For all its failings, considerable/major plot-holes etc Eagle Eye does have a central message about the frightening consequence of artificial evolution and governmental controls.

That there is another plot point twist yet to come that will be the 'real' reason, and that somehow everything up until now has been a dream or something. But the point doesn't come. It just stays in its ludicrous, logic-less, student screenplay world.There are no likable characters, no interesting characters, nothing worth caring about, and nothing with any remote sense of 'truth'.

It is very confusing and something that a young kid wouldn't understand. The story kept getting more things added into it. The story kind of ended up being very weird and unexpected. The movie isn't really what you expect at all. It takes unusual twists and turns. It does leave you on the edge of your seat until the very last second. It was entertaining and very loud with lots of explosions. The movie was very smart and original. I think overall though the story kind of was not though through enough.

The film has an outlandish plot, and a wacky series of occurrences with no backbone. However the lazy and plagiarist plot is revived by solid performances from Shiw LaBeouf and Michelle Monaghan, as the main protagonists of the film. Plus, as unrealistic as Eagle Eye might have been, it delivers its fair share of edge-of-you-seat moments. The car chases, the shoot outs and all the other tension filled scenes make the movie seem so cool, although it's just another suspense film that hugely relied on those that came before it. However, the one thing that made me love Eagle Eye is Shia LaBeouf's solid performance. He was just phenomenal. He was witty at times, and aggressive throughout the film and possessed an awesome enthusiasm and consistence.

A few exceptions were Death Race, Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, Harold and Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay and Eagle Eye. Yep, you read right, I said Eagle Eye. It is rare that I found a movie that intelligent. TDK and Harold & Kumar were really intelligent in both ways, action and screenplay, but Death Race wasn't very intelligent, still, action rolling scenes made it one of the year's best (I hope). But, Eagle Eye, up to date (besides Batman), is the best movie this year. And if you continue reading this review, I'll tell you why.Story: Two strangers, a young man who did not get far in life (Shia LaBeouf) and a a single mother (Michelle Monaghan), are called by a mysterious woman who tells them what to do in order to stay alive. On the other hand, she is actually making them participate in a terrorist attack to kill everyone in power to put the secretary of defense in charge. But this is a hard task since an officer from the FBI (Thornton) is tracking them down. First off, the actors. Shia, like always, is excellent and this is maybe this is probably his best role yet. Michelle Monaghan is an actress that I don't follow much, even though she was really good in this movie, but the real good one is Billy Bob Thornton.The story was excellent, and even though some parts of the action were unrealistic, who cares? I enjoyed Wanted and it was extremely unrealistic. That doesn't stop a movie with a very good plot and an intelligent story to be one of the year's best.",Eagle Eye

However, security could also overthrow the very liberty it was meant to protect and Eagle Eye is another attempt to portray how our need to feel safe may actually become our worse nightmare.Jerry Shaw (Shia LaBeouf) is a drifter. A drop out from Stanford who spent years wandering around the world with no direction, he pales in comparison to his twin brother Ethan who graduated from the Air Force Academy along with earning a top degree. Its easy to see why Ethan was their father's favorite and its also not surprising to see that Ethan's death drives another wedge between father and his less than successful remaining son Jerry who can't even pay his rent without help.Then one day, everything changes. Jerry, the failure of a son, is suddenly called out of nowhere from a woman demanding complete obedience. If that were not strange enough, he discovers his apartment is full of everything from the latest automatic weapons, false passports, and of course anything one would need for setting up a bomb. Jerry, it seems, has become the next major threat to the United States and FBI Agent Thomas Morgan (Billy Bob Thornton) is determined to lock up Jerry despite Jerry's pleas of innocence. Not only that, Air Force investigator Zoe Perez (Rosario Dawson) is also determined to discover Jerry's link to his twin brother's activity.Enter Rachel Holloman (Michelle Monaghan) a stressed single mother trying to raise a son while working a low paying job and spending nights at the bar with her girlfriends. When her son is invited to head to Washington for a music concert, it is then that Rachel receives a similar message demanding complete obedience at the cost of her son's life if she fails to obey.The two meet up in a way that is almost too hard to explain while sounding coherent. Needless to say, Eagle Eye turns into a classic chase movie with Jerry and Rachel doing everything to avoid capture with the help of the mysterious woman who, they discover, is actually a computer that Jerry's brother actually worked on before his death which the computer caused. The same computer also desires to overthrow the government and place Secretary of Defense Callister (Michael Chiklis)into power.Eagle Eye doesn't have much depth beyond this. Shia does an excellent job playing the down on his luck character as always while the rest of the actors fall in line with the clichéd roles they have been given. Monaghan's character seems almost pointless and one could not help but think that the computer could have chosen from millions of others who could have helped overthrow the government. Still, she does her best and the character is convincing for what she has to do. Chiklis stood out and it is unfortunate that his wasn't given more time since there is more this actor is capable of.Not really a thriller or even techno-thriller, Eagle Eye is amusement but not more than that. Don't expect to leave with deep ideas on the political reality of security in the light of liberty.6/10",Eagle Eye

Something tells me the loonies behind this misguided farce weren't thinking about blowing away Barack Obama, but that's the logical conclusion if you buy into the basic plot here. A mistaken attack leads to the sudden need to literally eliminate the whole Executive Branch of the government.Outside the gradually unfolding lecture on the Patriot Act and the generally overwhelming barrage of absurdity, it's not a bad action movie, with some tense moments and genuinely funny scenes.

What i can understand is if people don't like and are agitated by the cliques of this movie like i was. The Good: Acting - Shia LaBeouf and Michelle Monaghan turn in fine performances that sustain a wondering plot. Billy Bob Thornton is as usual good support. Marketing - If you haven't seen the trailer for this movie or a poster you must be blind! It made me really want to find out what the woman's voice and eagle eye were however they turned out to be equally disappointing. The Bad: Story - Shia plays Jerry and Michelle plays Rachel. Jerry's brother has just died and he gets home one day to find his room is fulled with illegal equipment (guns, bombs, poison). He then gets a phone call telling him the FBI are on their way. He gets caught. Rachel is being blackmailed by the person who advises Jerry to run by threatening to kill his son. Now as interesting as this may sound you may ask who is the lady's voice. It is a super-computer called ARIA that has all the information to everything. She gets too smart for her own good. Now where have i heard that before? Honestly the moment i found out it was a computer i groaned in my seat. Ending - After a suspenseful ending they throw something mushy in our faces and the last lines are one of the worst i have ever heard and when everything is sweet and silent the credits jump out in a big explosion and i nearly cracked up laughing it was so ridiculous. Action - I am not saying there isn't enough of it but who ever was filming the action scenes was drunk because it was so shaky i felt like i was going to be sick and it really ruined some well though out action scenes. Overall 5.5/10 - I don't regret seeing it but i don't want to watch it again either. And no it is not a movie that grows on you! I liked it better when i initially came out of the theaters.

The characters played by Billy Bob Thornton and Rosario Dawson were kind of bland, and the film didn't try to make you care about what really happens to them, dead or alive.

Hey! Why stop at the executive branch? Is the legislature chopped liver? I can't really fault the actors. Shia LaBeouf was good, yet the script was so artificial that no matter how good the acting was, the effect seemed comical. Billy Bob Thornton was largely wasted in this effort. He seemed like he was angry the whole time, probably at his agent for signing him up for this turkey of a movie.Michael Chiklis (Vic Mackey from FX's ""The Shield"") played the Sec'y of Defense, who, for some strange reason, the computer was going to spare so he could run the country after the computer wiped out the rest of the executive branch. Why the computer didn't want to run things on its own remained a mystery. Heaven knows it seemed smart enough. Maybe a little too smart, even for a far fetched sci-fi movie.There were some good action scenes, which made seeing this movie not a complete waste of time.My advice would be to skip this movie & wait for it to appear on your cable channel & DVR it. That way you can fast forward thru the ridiculous dialog & get right to the action sequences.",Eagle Eye
150,badoli,Just wrong.,3,21 November 2008,"This movie has some serious issues. The biggest spoiler was the fact that i watched the trailer and thought this might be a good movie. I am sorta right most of the time, but in this instance? Totally off.Meant as a nice action flick, it lacks the kick. The story itself is not new, but has often made a good movie. Yet there we walk into the first flaw: The script is miserable. Reality goes over board after about 10 mins. The ideas on the movie are so ludicrous, it hurts. Even this is not a definite problem, if the movie wouldn't take itself so serious! I was laughing at some moments about the insanity i was faced with.Second: No, Shia LaBeouf is not good in this movie. His character is just so bland, there is hardly anything to do for an actor. If you'd meet Jerry Shaw on a party, you'd excuse yourself after latest 5 minutes of smalltalk. Same goes for Michel Monaghan, no wonder her character is a single ma in this one.Third: The action is all cut in MTV-0.3 second-shots with shaky closeups and confusing longer views. Yes, this is trendy now, but the movie pushes so hard for action, you can almost see the fireworks being squeezed out of it. It goes boom, but i had a hard time to care about. Instead i often had the urge to fast forward, but sitting in a cinema, this wasn't on the menu.Seriously: I want my money back. Big cinema is going down? Well, stop making such boring movies.",Eagle Eye
151,powerfull_jedi,Liked it when it was called War Games,6,25 October 2008,"I was somewhat interested in seeing this movie, I mean Shia LeBouf is a likable actor, it also features Billy Bob Thorton and it's from the Disturbia director, what could go wrong?I was enjoying this movie(even with the eyebrow-raising opening sequence), until it hit the 90 minute mark.Had gone a different way, Eagle Eye would've been rated higher.First we kick off with a sentinel cam spying on a possible known terrorist, while Mike Chikilis as the Secretary of Defense monitors an event that looks unclear. A group of villagers somewhere in Afhganistan are being joined what appears to be the number 1 ghost terrorist on their grid. Their automated re-con device detects a 21% probability of an identical match, then jumps to 50% but it advises an abort.The Secretary of Defense can't make up his mind, so he rings the President, with a familiar speech pattern and accent and decides to order it regardless, even tought we never actually see what the villagers are burying.They all get blown to kingdom come.At an early point, I had no clue what that was about. Then we meet Shaw, played by Shia LeBouf, a dropout working on a computer store, who gets the news that his brother, a service man in the army is pronounced dead. Again, what did this have to do with anything?We find out soon enough, that Shawn finds millions of dollars on his account and he discovers in his house that he has enough fire-power to start his own urban warfare and he gets called by an unknown woman.Agent Morgan stops him at first, only for Shaw to escape with some unusual help and in the meantime another seemingly random character gets pulled into the fray, when she also gets a call.After that chases unsure, make that impossible-to-follow-due-to-terrible-editing car chases, tense stick ups and an odd conspiracy plot that starts off right and interesting, but then we get to that twist, which is exactly when we find out what the eagle eye is.What the eagle eye does and how it settles in the big picture is also related to two early scenes that I mentioned. A somewhat disturbing premise, one that ties in with the current War on Terror. It also borrows elements from War Games, Terminator and a little of Minority Report, as well.Minority Report, I can understand, since Spielberg has executive credits on this, but the rest feels like a carbon copy of said movies. I don't mind, you can blatantly rip off any of these movies as long as you do it right,yet Eagle Eye never lives up to it's own hype.DJ Caruso did a great job with Disturbia, I felt it had the perfect combination of a horror movie with the delights of a teen movie. But here, with a bigger budget and bothersome shaky cam, especially in car chases that made me feel puzzled instead of thrilled, doesn't get to the same level.I could also number a lot of flaws in the movie, but some reviews here have already got everything covered.If you're in the mood for a movie that still feels like a summer movie, this is it. Better this than Max Payne, that's for sure.",Eagle Eye
152,bwdude,Pretty good action if you turn off your brains for two hours,7,29 November 2008,"First off, this may be the most unrealistic ""trying to be realistic-movie"" I have ever seen. ""The Net"" - in it's days - was a down to earth, conservative documentary compared to this.Some of the scenes are so ludicrous, constructed, impossible, flat out dumb that it really hurts.But if you are able to ignore this and see it as total Science Fiction, you are going to go on a ride.This movie is made almost solely of action-scenes. Sometimes confusing, but entertaining none the less.After the ""Crane"" and ""Powerline"" scenes near the beginning (I don't believe that these are spoilers) I decided I would not take it seriously any more. And you won't either.After that I really could enjoy lots of action, explosions, chases, the works. It was like watching a space movie set in 3008 or something, utterly impossible but still two hours well spent.Neither did any of the acting stand out, nor was it original.

It seem liked the movies have hit a slump lately but this movie brings the movies out of a slump. Other than The Dark Knight this is the best movie to hit theaters.

154,MuggySphere,I was quite underwhelmed.......,6,23 January 2009,"I was totally underwhelmed with this.The action pieces on their own were good, but when they were all tied together and put into the one movie Eagle Eye becomes quite underwhelming. I liked the set pieces of all the action but this movie did not satisfy me as a whole.Shia Labouf's acting was alright, as was his co star Michelle Monaghan. They performed their roles well, given the material that they were given.Once ARIA was introduced I knew things would go from bad to worse. I figured it was behind all the voices on the phones once the computer was introduced to us. Up until that movement I thought it was a real woman ordering everyone around..ARIA is the most amazing computer in all of movie making, for she can not only direct every single traffic light around you to guide you away from harm but if your car has a GPS unit inside she can take over the GPS and even take control of the car... What a machine? Not to mention that wrecking yard and those cranes, now really who would put that kind of automation into cranes on a wrecking yard so no one need be actually there to drive them..I didn't much like the resolution to this all. A bit too easy, just pull out all her memory boards, drain the cooling fluid and pike her in the eye. Was that a rip off of GLADOS from the Portal game.

But the problem is the terrible Female lead played by Michelle Monaghan. She ruined everything what the movie originally intended for. A good suspense film reduced to a ""Single Mother/Working Woman's Heroic struggle"" movie - with a young lad as a Sidekick.A real bad casting for the movie. If she had remained away from the movie I would definitely give this movie 10 out of 10. But instead I go for a 3! Only because, 1)Shia LaBeouf - his brilliant take of an identical twin who lost the other half, out running the performance of Rachel Weisz in a similar situation from the movie Constantine .2)D.J. Caruso - The 'Disturbia' Director for adding a different suspense tone to an ordinary SCI-FI Action movie.

157,marimbadaddy,Enjoyable Action Flick,6,22 February 2009,"Eagle Eye was an entertaining trip. Sure, the plot was similar to ""the Net"", or more recently Die Hard 4; shared plot points from ""the Terminator"" series; and shared other devices well used in other on-the-run type films. However, there was good action and tension throughout the picture. In comparison, Eagle Eye is just a bit more believable than Live Free or Die Hard.Surely, there is nothing truly outstanding in this picture. It features good special FX, a decent and well thought out plot, (mostly) believable action sequences, and a fairly satisfying villain. Though similar, Eagle Eye is comparatively better than it's contemporaries like Wanted, Die Hard 4, and X-Files 2. It was better than I expected it to be.",Eagle Eye
158,Targe,A so-so modern-day version of the terminator scenario,6,4 January 2012,"For those not in the lingo, the terminator scenario is a term that refers to an apocalypse scenario where computers/robots take over the world.In this modern day take off on the infamous 'skynet' of terminator movies, unwilling civilians are enlisted by a military research computer gone haywire. The computer has the near god-like ability to jack into any electronic device that exists, including the completely ridiculous, like isolated plug in LED signs on the windows of stores. It is these lapses in credibility that sting most in this film, other than Shea's questionable acting ability.At the heart of the show is the real star - a very HAL-looking crazy robot with a sexy female voice that lives in a huge sphere of gold orbs deep in a secret underground military base. She can jack into anything electronic and instantly see what's going on, and if she doesn't like it, reach out and take control of many devices, from construction cranes to fully armed and fueled combat drones that, you know, just happen to be parked and waiting in a nearby airforce hangar, in the US.The action flies fast and furious, and the whole thing comes off feeling like a Universal Studios ride, with cringe-worthy Shea LeBouf riding shotgun, obeying the evil robot woman's every command while trying to figure it all out for himself.Billy Bob Thorton does a serviceable job trying to salvage acting by playing the mystified FBI anti-terrorism agent who runs along behind in the path of carnage left by this single-minded mad-bot, who is convinced she must decapitate the state government for their part in authorizing illegal bombings in far away lands (sigh, if only it were true...) The bizarre methods used by the computer to kill people is often beyond credulity, when she can just jack a predator drone whenever she wants, one wonders why she bothers with other toys, but you have to make this an exciting thrill ride, not a real movie, right? An OK rental if you like crash-em up car chases and/or have a thing for Shea LeBouf.",Eagle Eye
159,Amadio,Disappointed at basic premise - though entertained,6,11 January 2009,"We can all relate to feeling out of control, and this movie does a brilliant job of force-feeding us that experience in spades. Yet where it falls down is the relentless pace of action not allowing the protagonists time to consider or develop. I felt as if I had paid for the 'full action' and got a hand-job instead. I was satisfied to a point, but it is was not what I had bargained for. When I discovered the 'villain' I was sorely disappointed. This is a remake of 2001 Space Odyssey, not 2008 Bond/conspiracy/global network/terrorism adventure. The acting is *mostly* believable (Billy Bob, how did you get this role? Go back to boozin'. brawlin' and butt fuc**ng a la Bad Santa) and the action is certainly engrossing, but the characters are too stereotyped - the rebel, the good mother, the Condeliza Rice heroine with convenient black interest, the disgruntled father, it's all too pat. Give me The Sentinel, or dark like Denzel Washington and Ed Norton can do. Something, someone with depth that I can root for or hate. Exciting, but passionless.",Eagle Eye

162,gliderguy,Suspending disbelief is WAY TOO LITTLE to buy what this flic shovels out,4,3 March 2021,"A super-duper computer called Aria runs amuck and wants to take out the entire executive branch (or almost the entire branch - one Secretary is spared to take over). Key to this plan is getting a retired CIA agent Jerry Shaw (Shia LaBeouf) to its control center to override another programmer's operational shutdown. Now, most of us would just kidnap him with a gang of SEALs, but this super-duper computer has to go thru a complex series of incredible events dreamt up by a whole squad of Spielberg's writers which include construction cranes crashing into buildings and robot cranes lifting cars over garbage barges all the while with the FBI hot on his trail trying to kill him and Rachel Holloman (Michelle Monaghan). Hollman's one task is to kill Shaw after he reads that one sentence, but she doesn't know that. So, why didn't super-duper computer just have Shaw phone it in, after all it only needed him to read one sentence? Only the Shadow knows...
The whole movie goes on this way until Shaw saves the day (Holloman doesn't have the nerve to kill him). There are LOTS of spectacular car crashes and Predator drone chases to keep your interest up. The acting is ok, but not Oscar worthy: their most notable accomplishment was not laughing at the lines they had to read.",Eagle Eye
163,soger,Entertaining movie (not without shortcomings) but what people fail to see is:,10,20 February 2012,"that this movie is a story about real life dressed as a sci-fi. People keep comparing ARIA to HAL9000 and GLADoS when in fact she is nothing like those supercomputers. Maybe a little bit like V.I.K.I. although V.I.K.I. was brutal, ARIA is not.I'm sorry to break the bad news for everyone but ARIA simply did her job. They say it in the movie, by launching that rocket they violated the Geneva Convention. They were wrong and the attack caused retaliation. And the president using some oh-so-cheesy patriotic speech lied to everyone's face that the evil terrorists attacked the US. Doesn't this sound a little bit familiar to you? How many times did a president (whose name means shrub) said ""terrorist"" on air?After that comes some overcomplicated ride to orchestrate the assassination of the president but that's OK because it is entertaining. I mean ARIA could have just sent a few ballistic missiles to kill her targets but that wouldn't be much of a movie. By the way I read a really bad review where the writer complained that ARIA can hack cellphones etc but she cannot hack herself. Clearly the guy who wrote that review doesn't know much about computers.Finally our hero guy sacrifices himself to save the (lying and hypocritical) politicians and the collateral. I'm not saying that killing children is OK but don't blame a computer if you don't follow your own rules when it's not comfortable (or profitable) for you.",Eagle Eye
164,Medacakathareal,"Fun, not entirely original, but fun",8,13 March 2009,"Not sure why this film has been attacked so much, I mean sure the whole man versus machine thing has been done before, but few of those movies take place in modern times and force us to look at our own government, the war on terror, and our increasing reliance on surveillance. This movie serves as a warning about how the government watching us can become like a cold unfeeling machine and should serve as a reminder that Big Brother is watching.As for plot its a fairly typical suspense-action movie with some twists and turns most of which you will see coming. But predictability is perfectly fine for me, better to stick to the formula than try and FAIL MISERABLY at something brand new. The acting is all competent.Basic plot stuff, a computer system wants to assume control of the Government (and kill off the order of succession) to get America back on track with its prime directives. The Computer is a combination of other cinematic machines we've seen before. There's a little of Hal from 2001, some of Cerebro from X-Men, and that voice reminiscent of GLADOS from the video game PORTAL and of course who could forget SKYNET from the Terminator series.If you're looking for the Holy Grail of great movies, Eagle Eye probably isn't for you, but if you're looking for two hours of fun entertainment you could do a lot worse than Eagle Eye.",Eagle Eye
165,Hellrazr360,Eagle Eye: Lost Potential 101,2,24 December 2008,"More times than not we go to the movies to be entertained and if not that then we go hoping to be amazed or spellbound depending on what we expect from the movie. For PG-13 action/thriller films, entertainment is what the paying audience will be expecting. In other words, we expect a film like Eagle Eye to be entertaining; especially given D.J. Caruso and Shia LaBeouf are involved (after their moderately successful and at least entertaining film Disturbia). Unfortunately for us, this film feels like it was made by a whole different person.The plot of the film is actually pretty interesting and the first fifteen or so minutes do well to get you interested, especially with how the story kicks off. Characters are introduced sufficiently, we get an idea of what they're like, and once the strange calls start coming to the two main characters, the plot gets going and you feel like you're about to experience one hell of a movie. Sadly, it all goes downhill after the first few minutes.First things first, the few ""good"" things in this film; granted there aren't many. Aside from the beginning what the film itself does have going for it are decent performances by Shia LaBeouf (only has a couple very brief comical moments in the entire film, quite a change for him) and Billy Bob Thorton (who always has a strong screen presence) and a few good lines of dialogue during the first thirty minutes. Unfortunately, this is where the compliments end.Perhaps the two first flaws viewers will notice with Eagle Eye are that Michelle Monaghan's character is so annoying; for most of the film I was wondering why we're supposed to be caring about her so much. One of her first scenes in the film has her just sulking her ex-husband/boyfriend away before he can even explain himself and it isn't until about an hour after this that we even get a reason as to why she hates him, and it's only one reason. Add that with several statements she makes about Shia's characters (whether it's Jerry or Evan) and it becomes easy to want her out of the picture immediately.Another blatantly obvious issue with the film is that during the action scenes the camera shifts angles so much and so frequently that it's damn-near impossible to keep track of what's occurring. Those who complain about Michael Bay's films having too many quick camera shifts will feel a little more sincere after seeing this film's action sequences (there aren't many but they stick out).And then there's the rest of the story itself for the rest of the film, which is such a disappointment. As aforementioned, the story starts off well enough by getting you interested but after that attention-getting period in the film it just drags on and on. For a good forty minutes at minimum the film goes absolutely nowhere with the overall plot, with characters just moving from point A to point B being what makes up the second act of the film. If one were to sum up all the key parts to the film, they would likely expect it to be even shorter than a regular kid's film. To add insult to injury, the key plot points and plot twists aren't even the least bit satisfying, and when the whole ""what is this voice that keeps calling them"" question is finally answered I literally said aloud ""duh""; the film is way too predictable and annoying to get into after the first few minutes.And to make matters worse, the ending is anything but satisfying and is anticlimactic in the purest form. Once the credits began to come up, I couldn't believe how they ended it; I was just speechless by how horrible and cheesy the last five minutes were. Watching an ending like this is like listening to a horrible patriotic memorial service on fast-forward followed by a couple lines that would fit right into another cheesy romantic-comedy.I was hoping that Eagle Eye would be a welcome return to the movie theater after my little hiatus due to a lack of promising movies but it felt like I was spit in the face. The film starts out well enough and has two worthy actors in it but those couple compliments aside this film was a waste of time. I can't give this film even the slightest recommendation.",Eagle Eye

It can remind you about irobot although that s whole different story but the bottom line was the same. Main thing which i liked was the action sequence which was mixed with some suspense and thrill.

Is he erm suspicious about this - no. Jerry decides to open every single packet that arrives to his door whether it be an AK47 or handgun. Jerry clearly does not watch CSI and leaves fingerprints over just about everything. Idiot.Naturally this doesn't sit well with the FBI, who show up in complete incompetent mode with the fantastic Billy Bob Thornton playing the only half sensible one.

The script is decent, but what really makes this film shine are all the performances and the directing.I was pleasantly surprised to see Michael Chiklis, Ethan Embry, Billy Bob Thorton and Rosario Davis. While the trailer shows very little of Thorton and the other actors, the film did have more of him in it than expected. The other actors mentioned did an incredible job, even though there wasn't enough of Chiklis in it than I would have liked.Not surprisingly, the leads Shia LaBeouf and Michelle Monaghan, also do an incredible job! LaBeouf shines on screen and shouldn't let his amazing work ethic, acting ability or film success clutter his head and ruin his acting career (just a gentle disclaimer because this kid is fantastic on screen!).During the action and vehicle chase scenes, the director could have not shaken or blurred the camera as much, but I suppose that's just one of those things with action films.Anyway, this is a wonderful film with a fantastic ending! 10/10",Eagle Eye
173,mokshjuneja,Eagle Eye - Man vs. Machine story with a new rationale,4,22 November 2008,"Eagle Eye is one of the movies which have a predictable ending. No, i will not giving the end anyway. The movie is about a assassination attempt on the President of United States in a way but two normal individuals whose lives are not exactly perfect and not even remotely linked to each other.The movie starring Shia LeBeouf, last saw him in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of Crystal Skull and before that where he actually shot into stardom and became household name was Transformers even though the surname is a tongue twister. The movie also has Michelle Monaghan who starred in Mission Impossible III. Both of them come together to save the President of United States from a attempted assassination by a Man versus Machine game in the movie.This movie was just like any other movie where Man creates machine, man gives power to machine to think, Man gives machine to make a rational decision, based on certain principles. These principles are loosely overlooked by human beings and then the machine is after the human to kill all of them because they did not abide by the rules created by them. Then Man needs to find a way to stop these man killing machines. (story in the nutshell, without giving away the movie). Then you Man vs. Machine movies that you have in your mind like the Matrix Trilogy and the Terminator series, here came across another list.You also get glimpses of cyber terrorism - like Die Hard 4.0, where you have one centrally controlled mechanism which out there keeping a track of you, what you do, how you do it, based on how you do it - it starts profile your behaviour and the computer judges your behaviour patterns to understand - given a particular situation how one would react and computer registers all these details in their vast database and uses this database to its advantage.But the better part in the movie is the actions, specially there is a scene in particular there is a man who is running away and does not listen to the machine and the way he gets electrocuted and burnt alive was very gruesome. there was this other scene in the movie where you have the trailer truck is bombed with automatic missiles launchers and the way it get turned and crashed with in a tunnel was simply awesome.",Eagle Eye

I thought with D.J Caruso directing, because 'Disturbia' was quite amazing that he once again could make a great film with Shia.Basically, two strangers get calls threatening their lives if they don't follow the orders of the caller while the government tracks them down. Very convenient action and peril with no suspense, and no explanation that actually makes sense. This proves commercials/trailers are very deceiving. Honestly, I'm disappointed in Shia for deciding to do this.",Eagle Eye

The chases were fine and the airport chase was brilliant and top of the line. Thornton also is brilliant as an agent. The score was good, even brilliant. I plan on purchasing the score. There is no political statement that I can find. Clearly technology is an issue but not really used as a political point. The final scene in Washington DC is exciting and brilliant.

178,januaryman-1,Exhausting; still relevant,6,9 September 2013,"I gave Eagle Eye a six;it probably should have been a five, but it raises issues that need to be looked at again today. I watched EE five years ago when it was in theaters. I was not especially impressed then. I rewatched it now because of its theme of overreaching government surveillance. EE now seems a bit naive. It proposes that a federal supercomputer runs amok and takes control of people's lives through its intimate knowledge of everything they do. Substitute an overreaching executive branch operating through the paranoia kings in the national security infrastructure for the insane supercomputer and you can see that Eagle Eye is still relevant today.Relevant, but exhausting. The pace is that of a meth-addicted Jack Russell Terrier... Terrierist. The pace left me numb and unable to see all the plot holes. Saw many, but not all of them. The action and visuals are stimulating though.Shia LaBeouf is Shia LaBeouf. Michelle Monaghan and Rosario Dawson do capable jobs in their roles and are always a delight to watch. Billy Bob Thorton is Billy Bob Thorton. Michael Chiklis does a good job in his role as a cabinet secretary.Eagle Eye will hold your attention unless your as ADHD as it is.",Eagle Eye

It's yet another sad example of Hollywood throwing money at everything but quality scriptwriting.The premise, even if executed with any care towards remaining within the realm of plausibility, would still be hampered by CG effects that stick out like 1970's bluescreen backgrounds, characters that fail to have the common sense to ask for help and explain themselves given multiple opportunities to do so, and a Rube Goldbergian plot device that completely ignores the very premise of the movie.",Eagle Eye
180,miroslavhradel,A dull thriller that lacks both originality and credibility,3,3 February 2021,"Eagle Eye comes with a story that seems all too familiar and uninspired for a thriller movie that was released in 2008. That said, it is likely that its plot will remind the viewer of a handful of thrillers that he or she might have seen before, and the viewer will eventually realize that all of these thrillers were released five to ten years prior to Eagle Eye.For me, it generally felt like watching a remake of the 1998 thriller Enemy of the State. Of course, it would be a remake that was done pretty sloppily and its plot would prove to be far more preposterous. The visual appearance of Eagle Eye and many of its tropes followed suit. Thus, the feeling of originality plunged to the lowest possible level after just a few minutes of watching. An additional source of annoyance was the frequent use of the shaky camera, which I rarely find to work well as a stylistic device.The characters seemed chronically underdeveloped and gave me the impression that I had seen them in dozens of thrillers and other movies from the aforementioned time span. There were some lengthy car chases, but none of them proved to be really exciting and the reasons behind them were pretty obscure. At the end of the day, all that I could remember from these sequences were the images of countless vehicles being wrecked in an utterly cartoonish fashion.Finally, there were quite a few occasions when the characters' banal behavioral patterns and opinions made me chuckle, with their lacking credibility certainly being supported by the fact that the performances turned out to be fairly mediocre throughout the movie.",Eagle Eye
181,gtbarker,This should have been good but it wasn't,4,18 January 2009,"This movie had lots of elements going for it, that should have meant I enjoyed it. But it failed on so many levels. There was just too much dash and rush, too much cgi, basically too much crash bang wallop and not enough character development to care about any of the people embroiled in the plot. I don't know if this happens to anyone else but as soon as the noisy stuff starts these days I start to switch off. The development of storyline and character used to be valued by film-makers but that all seems to have been lost in today. All we were left with in this mess of a film was one long string of monotonous action sequences after another. There's an old saying - you've got have some vegetables with your meat, or in other words to make the 'good' bits stand out you have to build up to them with more ordinary bits, and modern film-makers would be well-advised to consider this. Then of course we have the usual schmaltzy ending, where we are led to believe the hero has sacrificed himself for the good of all, only for him to reappear battered, but still there at the end and all is well with the world - YUCK! YUCK! YUCK! Can we please just for once not have this pitifully twee load of BS!!! People die - even heroes, so surely it would have a much more powerful impact if the hero was to die for the cause? Just for once in a modern film it would be great if the makers had the courage not to pander to focus groups who will always plump for the happy ending when asked. Hollywood needs to grow a pair and have the courage to make it's own decisions again.",Eagle Eye

It was the most intense movie I've seen in years!! It stars Shia Labeouf, Michelle Monaghan, Billy Bob Thornton, etc.Jerry Shaw (Shia Labeouf) is an amiable slacker with an over-achieving twin brother. After his twin dies in an accident, strange things happen to Jerry at a dizzying pace: a fortune shows up in his bank account, weapons are delivered to his flat, and a voice on his cell phone tells him the police are on their way. Jerry follows the voice's instructions, and soon he and a woman he's never met are racing through the city (spectacular car crashes along the way), on to a plane, and eventually to the Pentagon, chased by the FBI. She is Rachel Holloman (Michelle Monaghan), a single mom; the voice has threatened her son's death if she doesn't cooperate. The voice seems to know everything. Who is behind it, what is being planned, and why Jerry and Rachel? The movie so far is fantastic, with fast paced action and some of the most amazing car crash scenes that will leave your heart pumping.This is another movie to check out and I was also impressed by the special effects they made. It was very well done.Eagle Eye gets 10 stars.",Eagle Eye

184,CagedinSanity,Enjoyable,7,14 July 2009,"I just watched 4 movies in 2 days so excuse me if my brain is a little fragmented. So I'll get right into this.I liked the character development. Everyone from Shaw to the robot.I'm not sure how absolutely everything is connected (minor complaint here, but minor. Minor) but I think it was clever and very Jason-Bourne-esquire (Movies of which I loved) how the AI was weaving Shaw around town. Using a crane to bash through a building? Rockin'. Forcing a train to go backwards and make everyone on the train get a call about HIM; Just to prove a point? Hells yes. I also loved how they were forced to rob an armored van on-the-fly without knowing beforehand? Awesome. But then, why are these two mentally strained people so quick to decide to ROB men with GUNS, even while trying to refuse before (and still try to later). It just seemed inconsistent.(Big spoiler;) I think it was very brilliant how the AI organized the situation to have the mother wear the explosive and her own son have the trigger. That was deliciously violent and sick minded, and I loved it.The problem? It was a bit obvious from, like, the first or second call, that the person calling was a robot. From the introduction that was calculating all possibilities and using every position to characterize their target (and still got it wrong, the idiots)... It was just easy to guess. The only thing I WASN'T able to predict in this movie, is what she was leading Shaw and the 'female' (forgot her name, but she was pretty much THAT unimportant) to wherever. So that was an interesting finale.Worth a watch if you like conspiracy-chase movies akin to Jason Bourne (I know The Bournes may not be the first ones to do that, but they are so ridden with quality I usually use them as a basis of comparison anyway)... It's not perfect but it's enjoyable all the same.",Eagle Eye
185,ohroonoko,Eagle Eye blindly imitates others in its genre,4,28 September 2008,"There are many films that have explored variations on the big-brother-is-watching theme from George Orwell's classic novel, 1984. Live Free or Die Hard, Enemy of the State, and Conspiracy Theory are some recent examples. I'm sure Eagle Eye will fall in line as a commercial successful variant on this theme, as well, thanks to the casting of Billy Bob Thornton and box office wonder boy Shia LeBeouf. And that's a shame because this is the least original film that I've seen in a long time, regurgitating elements from all of its predecessors, including films from this past summer (2008). The godlike supercomputer in this movie, Ripley, is a lot like the computer Hal from 2001: A Space Odyssey, with its own mind, scheming agenda and sentient sense of righteousness. But aside from the thematic elements that lack originality, there are whole scenes that look like they've been lifted right out of other movies. The cell phone net reminded me of the cell phone sonar net from Batman: The Dark Knight. The traffic light control was straight out of Live Free or Die Hard. The climactic symphony scene, with the tonal-triggered bomb, should give the producers of Get Smart some pause.Now, if you haven't seen any of these other movies that I've mentioned, you'll miss the glaring similarities and rip-offs and might think this movie was entertaining and creative. But for the rest of us, we're scratching our heads here wondering how the writers could get away with it. It's not surprising, as it turns out, that 3 of the 4 writers collaborating on this screenplay had no prior feature-film writing credits. That's right! This was their freshman effort! This was just a writing exercise in the art of crafting a blockbuster formula film! Favorite Scene: Actually the only scene I like from this movie was the UAV flying through the tunnel.",Eagle Eye

It gave me a headache.The computer generated graphics looked a little cheaper than that last Die Hard movie, whatever it was titled. They gave me a headache.I believe I will screen my cell phone calls for a few days. My computer has been acting a little suspiciously.

I wish I could have heard what he was muttering under his breath after each idiotic scene.The most compelling acting performance was turned in by the guy at the State of the Union Address scenes, ""Madam Speaker, . . . .""

189,on_the_can,A Solid Thriller,7,6 October 2008,"A while back Shia LaBeouf teamed with director D.J. Caruso to make Disturbia, an uncredited but thinly disguised remake of the Alfred Hitchcock classic, Rear Window. The result was entertaining enough with a couple solid thrills but ultimately fell flat of its potential and didn't touch the original with a ten foot pole. Now the actor/director team reunites with a similar scheme but with much better and more creative results.Like Disturbia this story draws from another classic Hitchcock flick, the twice filmed ""Man Who Knew Too Much"", but this time around the classic serves only as a skeleton for a much different movie. Only real Hitchcock fans will likely recognize the inspiration, I didn't actually connect the dots myself until the climax. Telegrams and traditional spies are swapped for cell phones, satellites, surveillance cameras, and pretty much any other electronic device with a potential internet connection.Jerry Shaw, a would be loser who recently lost his war hero twin brother finds himself inexplicably framed for terrorism and is brought in by the FBI, only to be immediately sprung by the very forces that set him up in the first place. The evil forces at work are represented by an ominous female voice who conveys messages to Jerry in a variety of ways, helping to narrowly escape death defying stunts and the pursuit of the authorities all in the name of her own secret agenda. Jerry's not alone though, the same ominous voice is commanding Rachel Holloman (Michelle Monaghan) who's son may be in danger. The two collide in more ways than one and are forced to juggle their conflicting opinions on what they should and shouldn't do in regards to the increasingly bizarre circumstances they find themselves in. If that wasn't enough they've also got special agents Billy Bob Thornton and Rosario Dawson on their tails.Eagle Eye is non stop action and suspense from nearly the first frame. My only complaint about the film would be that the nature of the villain is revealed much sooner than I would have expected...but that's a hard complaint to maintain considering it still kept me guessing to the end, even with that piece of information. I'm an action junkie who usually flocks to the CG laden adventure movies but has always had a soft spot for the classic thriller. While this movie is certainly more digitally augmented than the average thriller it still fits firmly in that classic mold and kept a much tighter grip on me than most of the genre have in quite some time.In the end...solid entertainment and highly recommended for anyone looking for some real excitement.",Eagle Eye

Then with the strange woman on the phone is telling him that he needs to do these dangerous stunts and he has no idea why he has to do these things, no explanation is Given.Then there is Racheal Holloman (Michelle Monaghan) she has just sent her son to the capital to play in the band at the state of the union address when she gets the phone call to help Jerry. These two strangers are now being hunted, but are able to dodge the authorities with the help from this mysterious woman on the phone.The acting was top notch, Shia LaBeouf has come a long way from ""Even Stevens"" he is an excellent action star and I look forward to seeing what he is up to next. Billy Bob Thorton as always was excellent as the tough as nails FBI agent and continues to prove that he can do several different types of movies.With a great cast and a great supporting cast this movie is easily one of the best movies of 2008, must watch for anyone who like a good action/thriller.9 Out Of 10",Eagle Eye

Meanwhile, almost-hysterical Michelle Monaghan races against time to save her son from a menace that turns out to be more... well... menacing than initially meets the eye.I noted a problem in chemistry between the lead actors, and I think it has to do with the 10-year age gap between them.Despite LaBeouf's valiant attempt to sport a goatee, he only ends up looking look a guy trying to look older than he is.He would have done better to rather embrace the boy-toyish sub-text resulting from the casting decisions, and just celebrate the manifestly MILF-ish complexion of his burgeoning intentions with single-mom Monaghan.You've seen this movie before if you watched ""Stealth"" 2 or 3 years back.

Very well done, and I was left anxious for more.The problem with Eagle Eye lies not in way it was made, but in the ridiculous script. All the ingredients of a good film are there, but the Big Brother / anti-Patriot Act message was handled with all the subtlety of a mack truck. When the primary villain and conspiracy is revealed at the 1 hour mark, I literally groaned aloud. A pure waste of money and talent. Shia, Michelle, and especially Billy Bob Thornton give competent performances, but the story is just ... dumb! For a similar film, please check out Will Smith and Gene Hackman in Enemy of the State.

193,goldwriting,Eagle Eye: I Think I've Gone Blind (SPOILERS),2,28 September 2008,"Shia LeBeouf is the boy with the golden ticket. We've watched him rise from talent on the TV in Even Stevens, make a breakthrough performance in The Battle of Shaker Heights (one of the winning films from the ambitious Project Greenlight) and land squarely in the middle of some of the biggest blockbusters of all time, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls and Transformers. His star is shining bright in the Hollywood skyline and nothing seems to be slowing him down except for the fact his acting skills are getting completely lost in terrible, truly terrible, scripts. Let's give his newest visual extravaganza a look see.Eagle Eye is the story of Jerry Shaw (LeBeouf), a young, brilliant son who never applied himself to anything and is scraping by in a droll existence dodging his landlady and bluffing money in poker games in the back room of his copy store job. This is also the story of Rachel Holloman (played by Michelle Monaghan), a pretty, young and bitterly divorced woman who's trying to vicariously live out her wild youth through her friends, while dedicating her only strength and passion to her young son. These two seemingly total opposites are ""activated"" and sent kicking and screaming through a dangerous series of hoops by an unknown voice on their phones, who can seemingly track them absolutely anywhere. Jerry is forced into it because he's been framed as a terrorist, while Rachel runs the gambit to save the life of her son. Together they try to stay alive long enough to figure out what it is they are supposed to accomplish.*There you have the basic set up. From this point on, there are spoilers because it is impossible to write about the issues with this film without giving away the plot twists. You've been warned.* There is no person on the other end of the phone. It's a computer called Aria who was designed and built by the Department of Defense and is now on the warpath to eradicate the chain of command, all the way up to the President, because they disobeyed a tactical recommendation she gave them. So after all the hype and excitement around the movie, it turns out to be nothing more than a poor remake of WarGames. This is only made more offensive by the fact that I loved WarGames as a kid and amazingly enough the film still holds up today, which many from that time period don't, especially when they have to do with computer technology.The film pretty much unravels from the moment you are told everything is being run and designed by a rogue artificial intelligence. The trailers were specifically designed to hide this fact, giving off more of a ""big brother"" fright tactic, and I applaud that marketing plan, except the only time that works is when the true plot twist in the theater is more interesting than the one we already imagined. This is not the case with Eagle Eye. No computer system would ever create such a convoluted and hole-ridden assassination plot. Computer systems are based on logic, even the ones we give personalities to, but Aria decides to make Shia and Michelle run rampant through downtown streets in numerous cities, dodging death and destruction at every turn, only so they can get into Aria's control panel and undo a biometric lock put in place bywait for itwait for itShia's twin brother, Ethan Shaw. We're supposed to believe that once this lock is removed, Aria can proceed with her plan to destroy the chain of command. Not bad, as long as the audience chooses to notice that by this point in the movie the plan had no way of stopping, even if the lock was still in place. All the pieces were already in motion and Aria was pretty much unnecessary to the assassination.Seriously, I could go on and on about the plot holes and logical misfires in this script. They range from a cell phone which can be triggered to only light up in short bursts and used to relay Morse code (I don't know about you, but one click on mine and it stays lit for at least three seconds, no matter what) to the fact that only one mini-mart shop in all of Washington D.C. has a security camera not hooked up to any external network. The amount of disbelief needed in this film to make it enjoyable is staggering, almost more than Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of Transparent Ego Issues. No one actually tried to make sense of anything in the film and it runs on the belief if you move the camera around fast enough no one will notice. Well I noticed and I'm nowhere near the only one.D.J. Caruso, the director of this silver screen misfit, is teetering on the brink of becoming Michael Bay, which I'm sure to some people is not a bad thing. He could follow this path and keep making bigger and bigger movies with less and less attention paid to the story or plot, but there's a certain amount of respect traded to the devil of special effects and deep pocket budgets. He won a ton of people to his side with his Rear Window homage, Disturbia, and gained Shia as his modern male muse, but this recent visual splatterstorm of nonsense has brought him back to square one. The cast of the movie, which also included Billy Bob Thornton and Rosario Dawson, kept up their end of the bargain, but no one could perform their way into anything meaningful inside the web of failed logic and shark jumping. The blame firmly rests on the shoulders of screenwriters John Glenn and Travis Wright, which is frightening since these two are currently writing the remakes of Clash of the Titans and The Warriors. If there is justice in the film world, let their directors know how to rewrite on set.",Eagle Eye

Over the course of this film, a variety of ridiculous situations involving technology. For example, in this film the ARIA program can hack into everything including cars, cranes, and other machines that you would think would be non-hackable. It is not explained how this program can hack into literally everything, it is just assumed that the members of the audience are already technologically paranoid so they will accept what they are seeing.Furthermore, there is a new one carat diamond crystal that will demolish the capital building which ARIA decided to demolish simply because she does not like a single policy choice of the president. You think there would be a good reason for her wanting to overthrow the president, I mean a tangible national security threat, but then technology wouldn't be the enemy as this movie is proposing. So the writers chose to think up yet another ridiculous scenario so that they can bash technology more. This entire movie then comes off as ridiculous.",Eagle Eye

Eagle Eye is the same thing but with all the joy and, most damningly, all the deliciously black humour surgically removed. Eagle Eye boils down to two strangers being dragged into a puppy-eatingly insane series of adventures by a supercomputer bent on... well, it's never clear exactly what GLADOS... sorry, ARIA is bent on – but she's pretty damn bent on it, that's for certain.Eagle Eye has been so carefully emasculated of all political sensibilities that it is impossible to tell if it is a authoritarian critique of liberalism or a liberal critique of authoritarianism or possibly both at the same time. You can read it either way. It's so cynical that you have to kind of admire it.--Spoiler-- Shia LaBouf and the unstoppably gorgeous Michelle Moighnaghanghg (can't seem to set the spell checker to ""Oirish"") are two strangers thrown together by a mellifluous voice on the end of the phone that threatens, cajoles and conspires to get them to undertake a series of increasingly ludicrous set-pieces so they can do do a high-tech ctrl-alt-del on ARIA a computer system so smart that it can track every cellphone globally and so mind-bendingly dumb that it didn't back itself up to it's satellite before having the liquid nitrogen drained from its cooling system.I must just have a brief aside on the subject of liquid nitrogen cooling systems because it's becoming more and more common in films. Computer gone mad? Quick! Drain the liquid nitrogen cooling system. Frankly we're all screwed if it turns out that Skynet has a big heat-sink and some fans. Liquid nitrogen cooling is great if you're the kind of person who gets off on posting the number of gigadonks that your computer can do on a fundamentally anonymous internet forum but here's an alternate strategy, MAKE IT UP! My computer runs at 1.23 bazillion megaflunks, now worship me you filthy reptiles! Anyway back to the plot... just in time to find it's been replaced with explosions. Quite good explosions one has to say. I like an explosion as much as the next retarded idiot who can tell the difference between a Grock 17 and a Grock 21 just by the noise it makes, but a good film explosions do not make. After the requisite blowing up of stuff our heroes penetrate the core of the computer system so easily that it makes one wonder why ARIA bothered with all the stuff leading up to that. They disable the safety protocols so that she can enact her plan to kill the entire command structure of the USA with a plot so unbelievably dumb that the machine must have a degree in stupid plotting from the University of Stupid (formerly Stupid Polytechnic, formerly World of Leather).Needless to say the plan doesn't work and eventually ARIA gets killed by being stabbed in her metaphorical computer face. This is like the scene in old films where someone shoots the monitor of a computer and it shuts down instead of just carrying on what it was doing only without the funky black and green graphics. I tell you the world is going to be in trouble when I come up with my super duper killer robots which have their brains in their left kneecap because everyone will be shooting them in the head and later, as they're being genetically altered into the lizards with computers slower than mine, wondering why the blasted things wouldn't die.--End Spoiler-- Despite everything I've just said I really enjoyed Eagle Eye. It had exactly the right mixture of explosions and Michelle Mognaganahaganahan (GRAAARGH!) to keep me entertained for two hours or so. You know how 300 was a like a commentary on the war on terror by someone who'd been injecting stupid-crack straight into their eyes? Well, Eagle Eye is like a critique of the surveillance culture by a spectacularly ADD 8 year old who cant decide if it's, like, the coolest thing ever or the worst thing since they took Super Mega Bandai Power Gruntles off the air.I want to close on Billy Bob's teeth.

Electrical cables that can shear off a surge protected overhead power-line simply by overloading it, impossible right, then the cable precisely lands on a target, impossible again!Predator Drones that need continues operation via a satellite link fly into an underground tunnel, wouldn't that severe the control signal !!!Crystal explosive the size of a pea can devastate a large hall, right......it just gets worse...etc.Don't even get me started about the AI super computer, 'I Robot' could get away with it because its set in the future.The beguiling thing about this movie, it pretends to be a modern high tech thriller, but is in fact its just a totally implausible day dream Fantasy thriller thats been done before, much better, ref (2001, Demon Seed, Colossus etc) !Billy Bob is under used and Shia lebeof is just doing a sequel from starring in ""I Robot"", who he starred with Wil Smith, who starred in 'Enemy of the State', with John Voight as a more believable baddie than a red lights in a round studio conning us its a supercomputer with AI capabilities.Where on planet earth today is there a supercomputer with Artificial intelligence capable, I dare you to disprove there is???",Eagle Eye

But it works. It does. Don't let the naysayers dispel you from a movie worth watching. Who cares if Spielberg favors Shia? I couldn't think who else could duck cars, cranes, the FBI, and still crack a joke that fits right in place. From Holes to Eagle Eye, Shia proves worth watching (okay, I Robot, was a bit silly). Eagle Eye does start out fresh and exciting in the beginning, gets a little boggy in the middle, and is soft at the end--BUT, it is still worth the admission price. You won't want to leave at anytime during the movie, the pace is so tightly executed. The stunt action is primo--the car crashes alone are standout. And the chase scene in the airport conveyor system is something else. The whole question of do we have too much technology is the theme. Don't forget to leave your cell phone at home.",Eagle Eye

I disliked it though, not for the same reasons as most: trite plot, stolen ideas, plot holes, etc because it's still a bit racy but more for the completely unengaging lead actors. Our heroine just comes across as a cold bitch and our hero as a sad wimp. At one point he throws a hissy fit and stomps out the car and our lady has to try and cajole him back to carry on driving. This kind of role reversal is embarrassing and cringeworthy at best. Neither leads have any character or personality and both are utterly humourless, one dimensional and nothing develops between them. Our great suspense moment is whether our puppy dog hero will get a good snog at the end and guess what?>>>>>>>>>>>.......he doesn't!!! Pathetic. So that kinda sums up the film.

201,darlybrito,Great action,8,25 December 2008,"Of all the movies that came in September, Eagle Eye was the most interesting movie and exciting of all. The trailer looked very good and I was excited to see the film. From the trailer, the story seemed very simple to me, but after watching the movie, I was blown away of much plot was in the film. At first, it gets a little confusing, but you will eventually understand the story.Jerry Shaw (Shia Labeouf) and Rachel Holloman (Michelle Monaghan) are strangers whose lives are being threatened by a mysterious phone call from a woman they don't know. Things get dangerous when the woman tells Shaw and Holloman to follow random orders that puts citizen's life at stake. As the situation gets worse, Shaw and Holloman become the country's most wanted criminals. Nobody knows why this happening, but Shaw and Holloman must work together to uncover the truth of why this is happening to them.The performances in Eagle Eye were solid and Shia was great in this movie. I thought Shia Labeouf was great as Jerry Shaw. Even though I liked his performance in Transformers, I thought he was a little better in this movie. Michelle Monoghan gave a good performance and portrayed her character well. The rest of the cast did a good job too.Eagle has very impressive action scenes and one of the best this year. The movie is a thrill ride from beginning to end and it will keep you on the edge of your seat. The car chases are awesome and very realistic. The film's special effects are also great. There are some big action sequences that I thought the effects were done beautifully and looked very real.Eagle Eye is a great movie and one of the best this fall. I was entertained from beginning to end without a doubt. The movie has flaws, but I would describe them as minor ones. If you love Labeouf, then you should check out Eagle Eye and I don't think you will be disappointed.",Eagle Eye
202,Nightopian-Raposa,Oh dear...,7,27 January 2020,"Eagle Eye follows Jerry Shaw (Shia Labeouf), a slacker whose soldier brother just died, and Rachel Holloman (Michelle Monaghan), a mother whose son will be performing at the White House. They never knew each other existed until they finally share something in common: They've been contacted by a mysterious woman (The voice of the ever-fantastic Julianne Moore) who gets them in trouble with the government. What follows is your typical action thriller with those typical twists and turns and a supporting cast-for-hire, including Billy Bob Thornton, Anthony Mackie (i think) and Michael Chiklis.

When I heard he was starring in yet another Steven Spielberg produced film I just had to go and see it! So it starts out like any other movie, relaxed and uncertain about what's going to happen but then our main character (Watch the film to find out) and things begin to happen. A twisting turn of events throw Jerry Shaw (Shia LaBeouf) into a whirlwind of an adventure involving two women, phones and the government.This is definitely a film for Shia fans and fans of action movies, in all I think Shia LaBeouf is the next action hero for the new generation.",Eagle Eye

It has a big budget, some of Hollywood's most interesting names (aside from Shia LaBeouf, an actor I'm ambivalent to at best) and a story which has all the trappings of a strong, edge-of-the-seat. A shame, then, that it blows it all in the kind of nonsensical, over-the-top action sequences that belong in a film like TRANSFORMERS instead of a supposedly believable based-in-reality thriller. The word preposterous is too moderate to describe ""Eagle Eye."" This film contains not a single plausible moment after the opening sequence, and that's borderline. It's not an assault on intelligence. It's an assault on consciousness. I know, I know, I liked ""Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor,"" but that film intended to be absurd. ""Eagle Eye"" has real cars and buildings and trains and CNN and stuff, and purports to take place in the real world. Was an amazing thriller, you will be on your edge of your seat till the end..... This film is not Shia LaBeouf's best performance, but he has been in some movies like Indiana Jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull (2008), The Peanut Butter Falcon (2019), and Surfs Up (2007).

Of course it's a male and female who are Strangers to each other, so you have to wait and wonder will they or won't they get romantically involved. It takes quite a while to find out what it is the supercomputer has planned, but from then on, it's rather predictable, as two ordinary people manage to become and do what highly trained military personnel can't. Of course the computer has the same shortcomings of many people and politicians, who believe that the end justifies the means, despite the fact that this whole drama (plot) started because the computer disagreed with an executive decision of the president. Lots of gratuitous car chases and crashes(for those who like that sort of thing). Lots of intrigue and suspense, before it becomes obvious a computer is calling the shots.

I wouldn't say that Eagle Eye is an absolute failure, but it comes quite close...There are glaring idiocies in the movie itself. You cannot expect me to buy into reading audio via the vibrations in a coffee cup caused by a cell phone on the desk. Unless you're on some type of exotic herbage, the level of control that the computer Aria has is ridiculous and not-so funny bull. The security in the capital is beyond all description. A security guard within 50 yards of his president doesn't open fire on a man with a gun that's running right at him? Please...The acting is quite unremarkable. I am not saying that LaBeouf and Monaghan should be drawn, hung, and quartered (optional order), but neither am I saying that their acting was any more than... gray. They were at times boring, and times mildly amusing... average. The movie neither suffered nor benefited from the actors.The movie was filmed quite well. Nice special effects, realistic incendiary effects, all that jazz.The idea itself actually wasn't too bad... with a much better plot line and some coherence (and possibly better acting), this would've rated a 7 on my personal scale. Eagle Eye is worth watching maybe once, but not too closely. Either just put it on while working in the kitchen, or disregard common sense and logic.

The premise of the movie is very interesting; however, Fort Meade (No Such Agency) does not have that technology and even if they did there is too much data being collected or not collected for HUMANS to go through it with any degree of usefulness.The trouble with massive data/intel collection is the MANPOWER to analysis, summarize, and turn it into ACTIOINABLE intel.Most of the systems that were ""Hacked"" into are NOT networked; we simply do not have the capacity, financially or time wise, to update all these systems. Example: our electrical grid is so outdated throughout the East coast that the estimates to update run into the HUNDREDS of billions. By the time the system was updated it would be obsolete for Wireless electricity is the next thing, yes you heard it here first. WIRELESS electricity.Of course at the center of the film is the ""Blame the Evil Genius Bush"" who is later thought to be stupid. Which is it Lefties?

220,alexsafc123,Lacking that little sparkle,6,23 October 2008,"Eagle eye is a modern day thriller set to examine the threat of cyber-terrorism and modern societies reliance upon easily manipulated technology. The opening scene of the movie perplexed me a little as the picture begins with a terror suspect in the middle east being observed by the US military, and the suspect terrorist being ever so discretely blown to kingdom come by two missiles fired from an unmanned drone, in the middle of a funeral no less. Good job guys, that won't draw much attention or get many questions asked.We are then suddenly dropped into the life of copy store worker Jerry Shaw. We see him struggling to keep up with the rent and having to endure his mundane job, only to then see him have to deal with the death of his twin brother. When returning home to cash a check from his distant seeming father, Jerry finds a rather substantial sum of cash in his bank account and when he returns home a rather substantial collection of weapons and explosives in his apartment. This is when Jerry receives the first of a series of mysterious phone calls with a woman's voice on the other end, that eventually lead him to meeting with a single mother, Rachel Holloman. The duo are then forced into taking on a variety of tasks directed by the mysterious voice under penalty of death. You are taught pretty early that the mysterious woman also has access to pretty much any and all technology connected to a network or the internet, terrifying and bamboozling Jerry and Rachel to no end along their journey.Without trying to give too much away, the story of this film was by far and away the most enjoyable part. The impenetrable mystique surrounding the voice on the phone and the death of Jerry's brother was more than enough to hold my attention for the duration of the film. The big reveal of the antagonist's final motive does not come as a surprise though as I had long before put 2+2 together concerning the purpose of Jerry and Rachel's escapades. I had hoped for something a little less conventional than the pretty generic final aim of the woman on the phone, but Eagle Eye is every bit as much about the journey as it is the destination.*spoilers* One thing that I found very humorous and a bit disappointing in this film was that the man villain was basically Glados, the main enemy from the game Portal. I kid you not, giant manipulative very powerful computer with a woman's voice, but nowhere near as funny. I fear the writer may have been taking inspiration from Valve's classic game when creating the concept of this film but left out the companion cube to try and dodge the plagiarism lawsuit. Whenever ARIA (the name given to the machine) was mentioned after that I could not help but think about the glaring similarities to Glados and also HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey. Ultimately ARIA not being a particularly original bad guy distracted me from the film somewhat, thinking that Valve and Kubrick had both done this villain before and done it better. */spoilers*I was pleasantly surprised about the depth of some of the characters in Eagle Eye. Jerry Shaw seemed to be well fleshed out and the director went through great trouble to try and communicate Jerry's attitude and personality to the audience, particularly in the first part of the film. He is consistently portrayed as the stereotypical younger child, forever living in his brother's shadow, especially in the eyes of his parents, and he resorts to non-conformity and striving for independence as a result. Not many action/thrillers take the time to give the audience the proper introductions to the characters, and although it's nothing particularly exceptional, it's a very welcome feature in a film of this genre.All the performances are pretty solid, Shia LaBeouf (God he has some cruel parents!) delivers the goods again consistently, as he has done in pretty much all of his recent film work. There will be no Oscars for best actor going anywhere near Eagle Eye, but everybody from Rosario Dawson to Billy Bob Thornton gives a good show.Is it worth mentioning the brilliant action scenes in films like this anymore? I'm beginning to run out of adjectives to describe CGI and chase scenes in films like this. It's very rare that movies with such a high budget skimp on such a basic thing now as the special effects. The camera shots, computer graphics and pyrotechnics all make for an exhilarating thrill ride, and this film can boast some of the more epic chase scenes I've seen in a while. Some suspension of disbelief is required for a few of the action sequences, but so long as they are mildly possible and look damn cool then they're OK by me.In summation I will say that this film overall is a pretty gripping watch, and if you're anything like me you'll remain engrossed for most of the duration. However there is something about this film that does not quite sit right with me. It may be the personal comparisons I drew with the main villain or something else I can't quite extrapolate upon further. Although technically very good, when I left the cinema, me nor any of my friends were raving about Eagle Eye, the experience just kind of passed us by leaving no real impact. Worth seeing, a good action flick and a good story but lacks any real sparkle.",Eagle Eye

Sure it reminds me of a bunch of movies, both AI betrayals and Phone held hostages but it doesn't matter. With so many movies and ideas everything looks like everything here and there.The pair of protagonists is very good and i liked the development, the sequences and the ending. The whole concept reminds me of the game Watch Dogs where a hacker controls everything electronic to clear roads and create obstacles for the enemies. Here though it was a little exaggerating as we saw stuff like Cranes and the likes that don't invlove an internet connection so they shouldn't be controlled...✍ But anyways, despite these few flaws that want you to believe in good faith the movie is fun and keeps you invested through the full duration!

This is one of those rare films. There's an unfortunate trend to make chase movies with quick cut editing, interlaced with CGI, lit very darkly to hide the fact that what you are watching is as unreal as most of it looks. Take away enough reality and you take away emotional involvement from the audience. There's no sense of danger and no feeling of wanting to shout, ""Look out! Go there!"" Car chases can be very exciting. It doesn't take a big budget to make a great car chase either. Look at any low budget action flick directed by Joseph Mehri (Executive Target, Land Of The Free) and you'll see that real cars, driven by real stunt people, shown in broad daylight, and in wide shots are far more exciting than close-ups of ""stars"" sitting in a studio in front of a blue screen mixed with quick cuts of darkly lit cars and/or CGI cars. When you can't tell which cars are which or where the cars are in relation to each other, you don't get too excited when the inevitable crashes and explosions occur. Apart from the horribly choreographed and edited car chases, train wrecks (man, that looked fake!), and running scenes is the fact that what is going on is impossible. When I saw cranes moving on their own in a junkyard picking up what I assume were high speed cop cars (again, you can't tell what's going on in the action scenes since they're so dark and individual camera shots last one second at times), I almost puked. Cranes are clunky, awkward machines. Yet they can pluck cop cars up from a 90 mph chase? Gimme a break. If this was The Transformers, fine, but it's supposed to be a real world suspense thriller. It's tough to care about any of what's going on since it's all just too unbelievable, cliché ridden, poorly lit, and quickly edited. Plus, the CGI looks awful. I read somebody's comment about the CGI being very good. Are people getting so used to putting up with fake looking CGI that they are used to it as just the way it is? That's sad. Give me real cars, real stunt people, lighting, and a story that's believable enough to be somewhat emotionally involving. Give me leading characters that I would want to have a beer with instead of wanting to punch in the face for being a sarcastic little know-it-all jerk. If that's what kids today consider a characteristic to aspire to, they're going to meet an awful lot of people in the real world who aren't going to put up with it for very long.

The cast is good, all the people acting were very (into the show). the storyline is well scripted and i liked the idea of having the back-ground newscaster repeatedly dropping hints on the show about the plot.I must say that it's not a fresh concept or idea of a show, however, it's a fun filled action (Clean) for families and friends of all ages.",Eagle Eye

That means they could remotely control anything remotely electrical even if it's not in any way linked to any network or internet.The first Bourne was great, the second was super hot, but less realistic - and this movie takes all of that, along with all the bad 'net spying on you' themes and ramps them up to a completely incredulous story that will have everyone saying 'wow, NO way'.Sorry, but the action isn't as good as other movies, and there's nothing in the story - so why bother?",Eagle Eye

234,joelmp,A Movie By Morons,2,2 January 2009,"This film gives plot hole a new definition. It is perhaps the most moronic film I have ever seen. The conceit -- that a government super computer ""decides"" to eliminate the Executive Branch -- is undermined by the godlike powers the film's creators decided to bestow on the computer. The computer is supposedly so omnipotent that it can manipulate cranes, traffic lights, cell phones, commercial streaming signs, airport baggage machines -- all in split second decisions while cars are careening wildly. The computer can blow up trains, electrocute people in an open field, convince airport screeners to overlook bombs --but it can't simply kill a few executives directly. Of course that would make for a 5 minute movie. So instead we get the most convoluted plot possible, all contingent on inane contrivances. To cite one of about 100, the computer frees our hero by having him jump several stories (more than once), the first time resulting in escaping death by an eyelash from getting run over by a train. Our loss -- the movie could have ended there. These accidental survivals, all beyond the computer's control, occur every five minutes in the film. Yet we're supposed to be awed by the computer's brilliant machinations, including how it ""motivates"" our heroes by elaborate means. It makes for exciting crashes and chases, but makes no sense given the computer's objective. The film escapes the lowest rating possible only because of the earnest performances of its cast. Spielberg, who executive produced, should be ashamed of himself. Paranoia about government eavesdropping and control of technology could be a decent launch point for an action film. But this idiot's stew isn't it.",Eagle Eye
235,dbacke1,Not an original idea,6,2 March 2009,"I really wanted to like this movie, but as an old-time movie buff, I kept catching things that were ripped off from older movies. The three movies that come to mind are The Demon Seed, Enemy of the State, and Colossus: The Forbin Project. The Aria supercomputer is a ripoff of Proteus, the supercomputer from The Demon Seed. The tracking of cellphones and other technology is borrowed from Enemy of The State, and Colossus: The Forbin Project deals with a supercomputer employed for homeland defense that goes haywire. The only original ""twist"" was the part about the twin brother. That part didn't work either, though, because even an identical twin will have some differences from his sibling, including the voice. That authentication would not have worked in real life. Unfortunately, I think that a lot of Hollywood executives are trying to use ideas from older movies and present them as new, and hope that nobody notices. There are a lot of people who don't, but there are still a few of us out there who are true film buffs with a long memory, and it's frustrating when we catch the recycled plot lines.

The editing was too quick and although i am a Shia fan, i feel he tended to get on my nerves.I thought Spielberg would have really thrilled us with his partial vision on this movie, being Exec Prod and all. The attempt to make it quick paced and non stop action was hindered by the emotional interaction that Lebouef and his co-star had. The chemistry between them was seriously lacking. A good performance from BB Thornton just about saves this one.Rosario Dawson does not convince me as an agent, shes right home though wielding a pump action in that wife beater vest she so famous for.It wasn't as bad as wanting my money back, but since we expect the best from the high profile team that brought us this one, it was really not up to scratch.

Better that than having everything laid out in front of you leaving you with the only challenge being how to eat your popcorn without dropping any! The special effects are credible and well executed. The plot has weight and twists, and the acting is more than acceptable - it's actually good.In fact the movie scores highly in my book - it even has an interesting theme and poses a moral question as we are forced to tackle the dilemma of machines making logical and more moral decisions than man - even if we don't like it.What lets this film down, and I realise I am on shaky ground here, is what I consider to be the over-the-top patriotic 'stars and stripes' ending.Watch this movie and you can see for yourself how a good film should be - well, until the end anyway.",Eagle Eye

Although stories like this one have been told before, this one really does tell it like no other giving us a perspective that hits home. Eagle Eye is about national security and what would happen if someone evil were to get inside and turn everything upside down on the people in charge of running the country. Now, I cannot say too much without giving the movie away so I'll keep it brief. Eagle Eye has outstanding action scenes and special effects! I believe it has something to offer for everyone. The writing is fair and the music is as well. The acting is believable from the entire cast and for once Shia Labeouf does a grand job of making us care for his characters safety and happiness. There is, however, a little more ""language"" then I believe necessary. To quote Nathan Wilson ""language is necessary to an extent. If you're a cop and see a dead women you're not going to say 'oh darn, he got away again!'"" with that being said, I rest my case. I said in the beginning of the review that this movie hits home and I'll tell you why; being a dad and a husband, I see now that I would do just about anything for the safety of my children. Just about. How far would you go to protect the ones you love? Would you kill or find a way out if there was one even though people could still die or get hurt in the end. Don't get me wrong, I love my family to death but this movie pushes the line of how far one can or could go to save them; to the point that makes all other people and priorities irrelevant including the safety of one countries future. We can't always protect our children from all bad things that happen in this fallen world, the best we can do is be there for them if they do get hurt and pick them back up.

They ruin a film especially one that bills itself as being full of mystery and intrigue. If I'm trying to figure out what the plot is, then throwing something in just because it would be cool is confusing (explosives and his room (surely there were better ways to get his coercion) / the guy that gets fried (how did those cable detach)). In this film it then ends up with very convoluted ways for them to escape (crane from FBI / cars and wrecking yard) which is supposed to make you think, wow, it was all part of the plan, but the actions scenes are too chaotic and the outcomes would be too random to have had a plan in place (phone in plane / injections to get into the pentagon / many people which just grab them and give them stuff).The clichés are just lazy (HAL) and have been done so much better elsewhere. I can accept that an AI can become 'a bit misguided', I've read enough Clarke and seen 2001, but the intelligence it exhibits to come up with the most stupid scheme is frustrating as there must have been easier ways to kill 12 old men especially when you can control UAVs.If you want to see a film with a crazy AI watch 2001, if you want more intelligent scheming AI then Ghost in the Shell, if you want an action big brother movie then Enemy of the State is good and if you want a really good action movie then watch Die Hard.",Eagle Eye

Based on the trailers alone, I made a five dollar bet about the ""bad guy"" in the film before the lights even went dark, and I got to claim victory halfway through the movie.Besides being mildly predictable, it was tense. Very tense. There weren't any major twists and turns, although the motivation for why these two characters are chosen to carry out this plot is fairly clever. One wonders what the nemesis would have done had a certain character been an only child. The stunts, chases, explosions, and fights are all well done and visually interesting, although it's clear that Chiklis, Rosario, and Billy Bob are being just professional enough as actors to collect their paychecks while still having fun with their roles.The last thirty seconds will also make you wonder what the dialog writers were thinking, and I assure you every hacker-wannabe teenager will have the checkerboard font from this movie on their webpages for the next three months. There's no real depth of thought to this movie, nor are there any revelations about our data-mining rich culture that isn't reported daily in any major newspaper nor fantasized about on Slashdot. It's aw-shucks McGuffins and security camera narrated chases the whole way, with a thankfully wider field of view than the second Bourne movie, but the cautionary tale has been around since Mary Shelley.

252,sam-moore82,Good fun and interesting beginning to end,10,14 January 2012,"First of all there are no spoilers in this review. There are very few movies quite like this. Others go along the same type, but not the same dynamic storyline, suspenseful moments or mystery given by this. The way the story is hidden, why people have to do what and why that character is involved is interesting enough to keep you watching. The characters are also interesting enough, with the main two having some sort of back story somewhat relevant to the plot. They have their emotional moments and so on which makes them feel more human and the acting is clean and shows their emotions clearly and, considering what their characters have to go through, it is very good. You also have the detective police guy and this other woman that I am not sure how she is relevant, but the events mainly go around the main two, with other characters popping up for 30 seconds clearly having to go through the same sort of stuff the main two do, but without the gunshots. The main idea of a woman mysteriously ringing up these people, telling them exactly what to do, with every electronic device at her disposal is interesting. There are some big explosions, some bullet shots and some deaths (The deaths can be quite violent but not actually seen in a way to make it violent) and a few sequences of suspense that leave you thinking what will happen. The final action by Gerry is powerful and a satisfying ending to the build up From the start to the end, this is a good movie. You will want to see it again for sure.

As I start off I absolutely want to applaud Shia LaBeouf for giving a great performance as he did in Disturbia and Transformers. He should consider choosing more mature films not teenager slick action/thrillers. He's an adult already. I know it's not meant to be realistic I realised that already but the action in it was really over done and unnecessary. I loved the idea of the woman on the cell phone but hated the conclusion. The story was weak, the dialogue was rubbish, especially at the end which was pointless. Let me discuss the ending, if I knew how crap that would have been i would have left the cinema and caught an early bus home and saved time. I really hate when modern action films are spoilt with love, it was OK along time ago and I excuse comic movie adaptions cause their based on old original plots but modern movies lack originality. Onto the positives the first half of the film was solid it kind of reminded me of Die Hard with a Venageance and Enemy of the State, it was a good idea and was kind of fun at the time then it revealed that the woman is a computer and the government is controlled by computers. It was over rated at that point. From then on I thought everything was a joke and laughed at some bits. Especially when I began analysing how crazy this film was I mean come on, he's a copy guy at a dull job and he gets so caught up in this mess and with no experience in any army training and coming from a slow developed physical disadvantage he rose to stop some crystal from exploding and got shot 3 times in the back with no protection saving the woman and the president, I mean they should have focused more on characterization before they moved on with the rest of the film.To sum it up, the acting and half the film were great, from then the rest is weird, the unoriginality sends you off track and you may feel like your watching a completely different film from the same genre.",Eagle Eye

The movie's main intrigue is in neutralizing this effort.What's even more disturbing is that the question of whether it's right to doom the nation in order to rescue the government is not even presented as any kind of dilemma, though the characters are fully aware of the situation, and though the analytical capabilities of the computer are not questioned. The right move is still to save the government, no questions asked - and the main character heroically sacrifices himself in order to save POTUS - and thus to kill millions of Americans.I thought it should be the other way around.",Eagle Eye

And ten years after it came out I watched it. Now we are after an NSA scandal and those things in screen are very natural for everyone. And something came to my mind, I checked two dates, this came out 2008, 3 years later came Person of Interest a very-very similar TV show. So I can say this is a forerunner of that.",Eagle Eye
260,nilbogman,I just don't understand...,8,21 April 2010,"Really, I don't. I don't see how Eagle Eye could possibly be getting only a 6 out of 10 on IMDb.Sure, there's a bit of stretching reality in this movie, but if you shrug off all of the non-realistic elements to the plot, you're left with a very finely-crafted, breakthrough film.The characters are very well-developed. You know from the start what kind of person they really are, and you are able to come up with theories as to how they will handle certain occurrences throughout the film.The action in this movie is top-notch. Never before has a movie kept me on the edge of my seat with my heart pounding as much as this one did. The special-effects are incredibly realistic and while much of the action is relentless, it doesn't take away from the plot of the film by any means.Finally, the plot is about as twisted as it gets. At the beginning, you have no idea as to who this person controlling Jerry Shaw's life. Throughout the movie, who the person is, its intentions, and its plans are gradually revealed, each time causing a huge twist in the plot that might not make sense at first, but when you think about it it makes total sense.All this wrapped up with great performances by Shia LeBouf, Michelle Monhagan, and others, incredible cinematography, interesting and creative camera-work, and a good amount of comic relief mixed into the action are what really make this a good film. So if you can stand a bit of relentless action and an audacious, non-realistic plot, this movie is for you. If you love conspiracies, this movie is definitely for you. And if you are afraid of technology, watch this film because it will scare you out of your skin.",Eagle Eye

262,visualmagic,Unbelievable and a little long....,5,14 October 2008,"I know it's science fiction. I know it's swing through the trees Shia Lebouf. I know it's popcorn garb, but I had to put my 2 cents in because a movie that is a) not a comedy, and b) punctuated with 'seen before' special FX and a 'done before' set of story arcs, needed that something extra in the realm of believability.Not only did the movie lack this, (and I tried to enjoy it, cause I think the cast is great, Michael Chiklis is great whatever he does), but it dragged a little.Also, I guess it insulted my intelligence, primarily by over explaining simple things in 5 different ways, first with a subtle easy to pick hint, then immediately followed by a direct 'working it out' reference', and then a paint by numbers graphic in case you were still puzzled, (or four years old).My wife said the same points as we left the cinema, just as I was thinking it.What does it have going for it? Not the story, sorry. It's unfortunately been done, and done better before. Big Brother cant see and manipulate everything, no spoilers here though sorry.Acting though, quite good. A somewhat saving grace, considering the script. 7/10, (more for some like Billy Bob and The Shields Mickey C).Special FX - 7/10 (by todays standards - it's no Transformers etc.).If I didn't know better, and can't blame a studio for agreeing with me, I'd suspect a formulaic cash machine.Insert Story line # 12 - Big Brotheresque control dialogue. Add 2002 budget quality of special FX and selection of peripheral on the way out or TV actors, and solidify with upstart Shia Lebouf who seems to be dazzling some demographics, at some level of effectiveness.Include explosions and FX, many directly copied from ex-Fresh Prince movies. Those FX too epic, mask with quick shaky camera and fast cuts to avoid analysis of detail.I sadly cant say more, or it will include spoilers, but I would suggest that the voting bell curve is wrong here, or dominated by 16 year old voters.This movie is average, and it just deserves a 5-6, no higher, not ever.",Eagle Eye

Problem is that after 30 minutes all the plausibility has gone out the window. There are so many plot holes and stupid things happening (the death of the US-citizen with Arabian background for instance) that it becomes increasingly boring too. And where do script writers take all this stupid names from? Ariia... oh well. And how clever to name Ariia's operator... yes, you guessed it, Bowman. Now guess again, Ariia does have a nifty red eye, of course, and goes crazy... of course. Thankfully that's it with uninspired parallels to 2001. Avoid it.

264,siobhandenton,"Not bad, but not great either.",4,31 October 2008,"Estranged from his family, broke, and mourning the death of his twin brother who he hasn't seen in three years, Jerry Shaw (Shia LeBeouf) returns home to find his apartment filled with various weaponry, multiple passports and a number of flight manuals. Understandably confused, he receives a phone call from a mysterious woman who informs him that the FBI will be arriving in thirty seconds, clearly due to the highly illegal items he now apparently has in his possession. Simultaneously, Rachel Holloman (Michelle Monaghan), a divorced and effectively single parent, receives a similar phone call after waving her young son off on a music trip. Rachel is told that unless she complies with orders, the train her son is travelling on will be derailed. As both Rachel and Jerry are quick to learn, their unknown caller has an almost omnipotent control over them; controlling all surveillance, all mobile phones and all electronic equipment. The pair are forced to work together, carrying out instructions in order to save both themselves and Rachel's son. Based on the novel All the Troubles of the World by Isaac Asimov, Eagle Eye contains some highly watchable action sequences and is clearly trying to bring into discussion some serious issues; unfortunately any attempt to do so is lost in a needlessly convoluted plot. The actors do their best, but both leads are better than this: Shia LeBeouf is surprisingly good, and entirely believable in his role, and Michelle Monaghan who has already shown her ability in smaller roles in Mission Impossible 3 and Gone Baby Gone, shows what she can do in a larger role. Eagle Eye isn't terrible, but it's far from being all that great. Watchable and relatively enjoyable, it's entirely trashy entertainment. Its major themes (surveillance and the power of technology) have been seen many times before and have been executed in a better way. Ultimately Eagle Eye ends up becoming a myriad of ideas from better films, with nothing original or new to say. Some of the scenes even seem lifted from other films, see 2001: A Space Odyssey, Die Hard 4.0, and The Bourne Ultimatum. Certainly more watchable than the relatively recent action film Wanted, the film is let down by a simply ridiculous plot.",Eagle Eye

Looking back, I think I agree that the film is a bit unrealistic but that's one of the earliest lessons I learned about films: never take them too seriously.It does certainly have areas for improvement but if you like a thrill ride packed with heart-stopping, fast-paced action then Eagle Eye is the film for you.",Eagle Eye

Apart from its lack of originality and ability to interest you, it's really all about the ridiculous action and CGI. I've come to learn that expecting something more from a summer blockbuster (apart from a few good ones) is never a good thing. If you have that mindset with this movie, you'll enjoy it in a mild sense. The actors aren't bad and Shia LeBeouf can certainly carry a movie. But the story is convoluted, filled with plot holes and is placed secondary like any big budget blockbuster Hollywood film for the purpose of showing off the CGI and action sequences.I wouldn't highly recommend this film to anyone; expect maybe if it's on TV and you have 2 hours to spare.

271,firedude34,"If you have half a brain, wow did this movie blow...",2,12 October 2008,"Where to start with this movie. There are so many unbelievable premises I don't even know where to start. Conspiracy theorists will love this movie. Everyone else will just constantly find themselves saying ""Riiiiight."" & ""You've got to be kidding me"" Let's just cover some of the premises we are asked to believe:1. There is a Super-Super Computer (called Aria) designed to recognize threats to national security by monitoring every cell phone, computer, video camera, and radio frequency in the world. All by itself. Stupid evil Patriot Act.2. Aria can make high tension power transmission lines overload and snap exactly where she needs to just so the wire can fall and kill someone that disobeyed her (Aria has a female voice).3.Aria has decided that the President and his entire cabinet must be eliminated because they didn't listen to her advice on a missile strike in the Middle East, and thus must be a significant threat to the national security of the United States. Pres and his cabinet must be Republicans. 4. Aria can read lips and follow conversations just by observing the vibrations of the conversation on the surface of a cup of coffee. 5. Aria can hack into any security camera, cell phone, airport metal detector, remote controlled crane, etc. on a moment's notice and take control of them. Totally anonymously. 6. Aria can control anything and everything electronic in the world, but can't overcome some internal programming that prevents her from accomplishing her mission.7. There is a newly discovered crystal that when properly triggered, a 1 carrot diamond sized piece of this crystal will demolish the Capitol building.8. It seems we have remotely piloted vehicles (RPV) that look just like a Predator RPV sitting around the U.S. on military bases fully loaded with missiles and machine guns just waiting for a demented Super-Super Computer to take control of them. 9. Apparently it takes about 4 days to get to D.C. from the Midwest by passenger train. No wonder Amtrack is always in trouble...10. If you slow your metabolism enough, you can survive a ride in the un-pressurized bay of a military transport aircraft.11. A single missile strike in the Middle East triggers the 'real' Jihad world wide and threatens the U.S. and it's evil capitalistic interests.12. If you dress like a cop, you can waltz into the Capitol building when the President and his entire staff are there and Congress is in session. With a sidearm. Oh, and there is a secret access tunnel under the Capitol.13. The rest of the world has to pass through 20 layers of heavy security to get to Aria's secret level of the Pentagon. But, if you know the right computer, you can get direct access to Aria's level via a service elevator that is nowhere near any security.It just goes on, and on, and on through the entire movie. Jeez I couldn't wait for it to be over and boy was I glad when it was! Uhg. Nothing in the movie was believable. I thought Vantage Point was a bad movie this was worse.

The acting was excellent, and Shia's just getting better in each movie that he's in.A couple scenes were a little unrealistic, but overall, the action and excitement that made the movie so entertaining, allowed people to push the unrealistic parts aside.Plenty of people have been saying that the ending wasn't ""good enough"" or it should have been better. I disagree. I think that the ""good guys"" won, even though plenty of people refer to them as the ""bad guys"". Having a main character die at the end would have added something more, but I think that the ending was good too. If you kill off a lead character, someone's going to be mad and then none of the women fans would buy the DVD! Overall, I think this movie was sweet.

The story focuses around a boy who works at a photocopy machine store named Jerry Shaw (Shia LeBeouf) who just finds out that his twin brother died. After coming home to his apartment he discovers a lot of illegal weapons and such in his room. That's when he gets ""The Mysterious Phone Call"" about the FBI coming. He soon starts to wonder if they meant to ship the stuff to his brother whom the FBI thought was a terrorist. He finds himself getting a bunch of phone calls from a female computer voice commanding him what to do and where to go. So Jerry and a lady he finds along the way who has just sent her son on a train to the white house to perform for the president learns that if SHE doesn't do what the computer tells her to, then her son dies. So the computer is basically trying to lead Jerry to her to unlock her, because she is an extremely smart computer created by a secret group called ""Eagle Eye"". There's a bit of a weird twist in the middle, and the ending just kinda ends.

If you want a full summary of the stupidity of this film find any review with a 1 star rating and read it.I only want to point out two issues with this film because they're enough, on their own, to send this thing to the bottom faster than the Titanic. Both of these are spoilers, in the sense that they spoil this films tenuous link with reality, and in the sense that they spoil the plot, such as it is.1. Part way through the film the all-controlling all-powerful sentient computer antagonist uses its elaborate computer skills to control... not a traffic light, or a cellphone, or a computer, or a robotic crane, but a car's airbag.Yes. Air bag. That thing that inflates when you crash.2. The entire premise behind the hero being recruited as a pawn in the above-mentioned super computer's nefarious plot is that the hero has an identical twin brother who worked with said computer, realised what it was up to, and used some sort of voice override command. Thus the hero is now needed to come in and unlock the voice override.Problem is, near as I can tell the voice override has the function of overriding exactly nothing. Every single phenomenal controlling trick the computer pulls, including setting up the entire elaborate assassination plot, takes place BEFORE the lock is removed.What was the point?

Yes, it's a super computer. Its presentation wasn't terribly far-fetched (until the end, and even then). The movie stays just this side of ""over the top"", and it's so much better for it. It fits into the Patriot Act bit rather nicely. Topical, but just about worthy.2. My computer can detect a faulty network data cable, complete with precise distance setting. While it is a bit on the fantasy side, it is technically not a wild OTT silly moment to have Aria send a pulse that could cause the wire to snap at a particular junction. Not the biggest of gaffes, I regret to say.3. ROTFLMAO!! No argument there; their clout is gone...4. Sound vibrations. Again, not terribly far fetched to be dismissed as addled camp. Try that new and equally gaudy BBC Wales series that people think is so great... can't get any more camp and pretentious than that... (pity we can't name-drop...) Here's a hint: ""Vote for Saxon"".5. Why not? ""Trusted Computing Modules"", GPM, this is another piece that isn't entirely removed from reality.6. Rather like a self-destruct button. You typically don't do it if you perceive it as such. We all know how to kill ourselves too, but we don't do it. Perception. Computers also mirror the logic of their creators.

The audience is going to be laughing no matter what you do, so if you don't bring the funny yourself, they'll bring it instead. EAGLE EYE doesn't bring the funny.From now on, I'm going over the stories of all Shia LeBeouf movies with a fine-tooth comb to tease out the Hitchcock ripoffs. I could name the one here but it would be a spoiler. Then again, the movie kind of spoils itself. If I said any more, you'd Know Too Much.Structurally, the movie passes plausible pretty early on. Which is merciful because when it arrives at insane about midway through, the shock isn't as great.It sucks.The Voice on the Phone is great. Someone around here said it's Julianne Moore, which sounds probable to me. I was guessing Joan Allen. In any event, a bright spot.

But at the same time there is nothing special about the movie which makes it different from others. The plot will remind you of ""I, Robot"". Shia LaBeouf is a good actor and has done some good movies like Constantine and Transformers but personally I feel that he is still young to take the burden of this kind of movie alone. Michelle Monaghan was also good but the chemistry between both the actors doesn't come alive, maybe because of the age difference.This movie will not leave you disappointed but don't get your hopes too high.",Eagle Eye
287,athagram,You will enjoy this one!,7,24 February 2019,"It begins as a terrorism-movie but it reveals to be a cyber-war/cyber-attack film. Although it is not an original idea, the movie runs well, the effects are nice and the flow is addictive.One ""minus"" is that it became apparent from an early stage that the mind behind the attack was Aria. This could be fixed with a more complexed conspiracy. Even so, it was a nice choice.",Eagle Eye
288,ca-george,I liked Eagle eye but...,7,27 September 2008,"I walked into Eagle Eye with the highest of hopes, and I walked out having mixed feelings. The overall tone of the film was a chaotic, but seemingly well put together action, drama, science fiction flick. Pretty much a smart popcorn movie, and yes that's what it was.Lets start with Shia Lebouf. I really like this young smart actor. He was quite believable in this role as Jerry Shaw. Did I think that the hair on his face was intended solely to make him look, say 25 26? yes. Did his hair distract me at times? Yes. But hey it was alright. His comedic element in this film was minimal but when he did make a joke it was pretty funny. I did enjoy that element.The action in the film was done in a very chaotic fashion. Many times the camera is moving so much and the cuts are so fast you are not really able to see the full extent of the destruction or when and what will happen next. At times I did have to adjust my eyes to try and make out what was happening. I felt the photography was mimicking a ""bourne'esque"" feeling but it failed because the movement was to frequent. Also i felt that the framing was very much off. The DP seemed to frame the characters (on still shots) from below the eyebrows, more so focusing on the mouth.The lighting was good on some scenes, but very much off on others. The scenes where it was off, really threw off the make up departments hard work. Billy Bob and Rosario seemed to be caked in make-up and it was quite obvious and didn't seem natural at all. Even Billy Bob's cut across his forehead (after being hit in the airport luggage conveyor belt) seemed more of a bright pinkish color rather than a dark reddish color of blood.The effects team did do a great job with this film, not only were the practical effects great but so were the visual effects. The gritty realism of the car chase sequence onto the cranes was stunning. The visual effects sequence with the crane crashing into the FBI building was also great.My favorite scene was the very ending when Shia's character decided to jump up before the president and fire his gun. The pacing, the tone, the emotion, the score, everything was perfect in this scene. The sentiment really engulfed me into the film and surrounded me with Jerry Shaw's final decision. Overall the film was good, and I will most likely be purchasing this on DVD, but Disturbia is a first rate classic for D.J. Caruso and I believe it is a better film out of the two.",Eagle Eye

290,power_fist16,Expect the unexpected.,8,30 July 2011,"I found this movie very interesting for sure. The concept of our own technology taking over the world is a scary thought. This movie was good because it made you believe that Shia La boofs character is responsible, but as you watch it further your not quite sure who's bad and who's good. Because it starts to get really confusing the more you watch it. Thats where this movie does not make sense.The continuous confusion makes this movie so confusing you end up not really knowing whats going on, not to mention that for a thriller this moves too fast. Now don't get me wrong this is a good movie, its intense and heart pounding and leaves you wondering but it moves too fast that you don't get to understand the plot fully. If this movie made more sense than I would be able to appreciate it a bit more.But for a movie like this its nice to see something different and refreshing instead of the same old human being a killer you have technology that's the killer and that makes this movie unique and creative. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see something unique and creative and different.",Eagle Eye
291,sandeeppandana,Thrillingly wasted,7,27 September 2008,"As the saying goes : ""A thrilling trailer doesn't account for a thrilling movie"", applies perfectly to this flick. After seeing the movie, I felt it seeing somewhere before, Oh i forgot it was the trailer. The trailer is the perfect summary of the movies. If one sees the trailer, I see no reason to see the movie as everything is revealed in the trailer. I strongly resent the way the movie is marketed. But I don't deny the presence of some breath taking moments which were worth my bucks. The movie also lacks logic as I have no reason to believe that technology is so advanced and all the systems are interconnected to such an extant. All in all it makes a good fairy tale are a good imitation or rather amalgamation of ""Live Free Or Die Hard"" and ""Borne Ultimatum"".",Eagle Eye
292,jakeacts,The movie is in thriller limbo....,7,26 September 2008,"Eagle Eye blew me away with it's amazing trailers and awesome choice of actors, but sadly there are to many flaws to keep this Eagle flying high longer than 5 minutes.At the beginning of the film Jerry Shaw(Shi Labeouf) is just told that his twin brother has been killed. This cuts into Jerry's heart and leaves him hollow until on the same day he walks into his apartment to find it jack full of poison, manuals, guns and anything else that's terrorist like. Jerry receives a phone call from a woman saying that the FBI will raid his apartment in 30 seconds. And thus begins where Eagle Eye starts to fade off from an emotional thriller into more of a 'Transformers"" type film...Eagle Eye does thrill, but sadly the action scenes are either far too short, or WAY too long. One of the high points of the film is where Labeuf's character is told to duck, and then a crane comes careening through the building. Good stuff. But there's not enough of it. Points of Eagle Eye feel like the Bourne Identity, which is usually the movies high points. But, some parts feel like a Summer Blockbuster with no brain.Everything was going fine for Eagle Eye until the story turns into 2001: A Space Odyssey. Yes that's right, there is no terrorist group out to hunt down ol' innocent Shia Labeouf. Instead we are given a psycho-patriotic fem-computer that will do anything to correct America.Eagle Eye, though having faults, has some very thrilling scenes and most of the acting is great. Shia really feels like your average Joe who's just been framed.Spielberg produced Eagle Eye but it's nothing compared to his other films. I give Eagle Eye a high 7.",Eagle Eye
293,Lawwst,digged it,9,8 January 2009,eagle eye was fantastic really enjoyed it seriously labeouf as come a long way from even Steven's. he's doing a kiss ass job great actor did very well. Michelle monaghan smoking hot also did great. good ol' billy bob Thornton. Rosario Dawson great actress but her character i just wasn't into it my only real problem with the movie shia character in the end gets shot twice in the back once in the shoulder and came out with a little sling. its okay for the hero to die every now and then you know it would have gone great with the way he jumped on the table and with the dramatic music playing would have been a great end off to saving the president and civilians,Eagle Eye
294,mneiai,A great popcorn flick,8,25 September 2008,"Eagle Eye is a well-paced, action-packed popcorn movie up at the same level as most of Shia LeBouf's other movies. It had just enough mystery to keep a intellectual interest throughout the explosions, horrific deaths (though, of course, the rating meant they were off-screen), and originally awkward interaction between the two main characters. While an attentive viewer will guess most of the ""surprises"" before they are revealed, the question as to how the movie will ultimately end makes up for any disappointment.The acting was better than expected, the storyline as original as it could hope to be, and, all in all, it is certainly a movie I suggest to fans of action, Shia, or government conspiracies.",Eagle Eye
295,Abby_Morel68,Builds then crashes,6,12 August 2009,"This movie was a fairly good movie. 2 people who had never met before are thrown together for they don't know what reason. There are narrow escapes from severe car crashes and from arrests by the police. Some of the reasoning is weak (A shot of an experimental heart drug to slow down the heart rate while being flown in a box to the capital) Some of the action seems forced (A guy who wants to walk away from this situation: he's walking away, so he gets fried by high power lines) The finale: the guy you've been following through the movie, in order to stop the music from playing, shoots into the air in the general vicinity of the President. (It stops the music, alright, and the action)My main problem with this movie is the ending. After the action stops, the end is like ... Bleah! It seems as though the director, the action teams, and the writers all got together after putting as much action as possible onto the screen, then went ... ""Whoops! How do we end this? Okay we stopped the music, so there wasn't an explosion, and the other 2 stopped the computer ... er ... now what?"" ""How bout we just get the 2 together, and he remembers the boys' birthday and buys him a great gift then the 2 adults kiss, the end."" ""Great: That'll do. Shoot it: then we can wrap and have our cake.""I agree that many of the action scenes were borrowed from many other movies, but where else can a director get action scenes. I don't think that there are any ""great action scenes"" that haven't already been done. All in all, it's a terrific action movie, it's just the ending that I don't particularly enjoy.",Eagle Eye
296,m-machine,Superb: a Must seen with a healthy dosage of Cheese,9,21 December 2008,"Very well crafted. I admit there was some cheese in the plot, the scenario wasn't the most innovative, and the ""LaBeouf"" fetish of Mr. Spielberg is getting a little annoying. However, the very flawless action, the fastest rhythm imaginable, great acting, and the superb story line combined with the most un-thinkable twists, just made the very best movie of 2008. Yes, as an old fan of Indiana Jones, and Batman, I hereby confess that Eagle Eye was one head and shoulder above both. I didn't blink until the very end, which by the way had surprisingly more dosage of cheese than I expected. However, I must point out something that's bogging me my whole life; don't writers read these scenarios twice? Even in this scale? Even under such budget? Even in a movie as good as this? WHY SHOULD WE AUDIENCE- ALWAYS SCREAM THE MOST NATURAL REFLEX A NORMAL PERSON WOULD DO IN A CERTAIN SITUATION? WHILE THE ACTOR IS DOING SOMETHING VERY STUPID!

300,surfin_papa_smurf,"A 6/10 in my books, with that all important plot twist.",6,27 September 2008,"Going in to see the movie, I didn't quite know what to expect. My main reasons going to see the movie were because Shia, and Billy Bob Thornton was in it.Shia's character, Jerry Shaw, was played fairly well. There were a few times I wasn't completely convinced, but overall he did a wonderful job. He doesn't play that slacker, half job kid too much in this film. His character shows a large amount of responsibility, and it was a refreshing new character for Shia, and shows that he has the capabilities to carry future films.Billy Bob Thornton's character, could've been better. He was probably my least favorite. He had the possibility to be an amazing character, but Billy Bob Thornton just didn't do it for me. He was lacking certain aspects of emotions, that I would have expected from the character he's supposed to play.Michelle Monaghan acted very well in this film. It was my first time seeing her in anything, but she definitely sold me on her performance. She's probably my second favorite character from that movie. Bravo.Overall, it's was a fairly decent movie. Not quite what I expected, and it had some cliché's you see in all movies, but it wasn't bad. I would say it goes in my top 25 movies, because it gave me the impression the Bourne series gave me. It's a good action film, but it needs depth. I wouldn't call it my favorite movie, based on the impression I wouldn't go back to the theater to see it. I will definitely buy it when it comes out, though.I would recommend this movie to anyone that likes a thrilling, suspenseful, and action movie.",Eagle Eye
301,lareview,Not a good movie,4,25 September 2008,"I went to an advanced screening of the film and had the privilege of watching it in IMAX which always looks great. Technically the film looks nice with the exception of some action scenes that were cut together too fast to see what is going on with shaky camera moves like Blair Witch Project; this most likely was by design to create suspense. The performances were good from Shia Labeouf and Michelle Monaghan and technically overall the movie is solid. Here is the problem and do not read anymore if you have not seen this film- the story is absolutely ridiculous and has more holes than a gold course. We are supposed to suspend disbelief and swallow that a modern 2001 Space Odyssey Hal is running the country and feels that the executive branch of government is not doing their jobs properly and therefore should be executed. The female lead is very unlikable and begins to yell at her ex-husband for showing up late- grow some balls dude! But the story gets even worse as we see electronic billboards telling the characters to run into a garage and take a top secret formula to slow your heart down so you do not die in a cargo hold of an aircraft. This movie is silly and not in the good way. I have a hard time believing that a computer can do so much when my cell phone lost reception 3 times on the way to the screening. The film asks you to really, really suspend disbelief. Sorry but this one is a turkey and if you want to see it done right watch 2001 Space Odyssey directed by Stanley Kubrick or even James Cameron's Terminator 2.",Eagle Eye
302,The_ToughCritic,Completely Unoriginal,6,6 October 2008,"I wasn't sure what to expect because I thought that the previews just told you someone is watching, and there making people do things. Which yes, is true. But if I could combine irobot with Stealth, and throw in some OK cast members then I'd have Eagle Eye. The whole robot controlling everything never changed. The only thing was that instead of actual robots, it just controlled modern day technology to do its bidding. I was extremely disappointed, and was kind of hoping Will Smith would pop out of BFE (Bum f****** Egypt) and save the plot. And its because the plot is so unoriginal. There comes a point where everything is predictable. But nope, they would've been better off calling it irobot 2 and sending it straight to DVD. I give it a six mostly because it wasn't a garbage movie. But, because of how it lacks originality. Shia loafer wasn't bad either, but I'm starting to see him as a mono-toned actor. All of his eek's and ow's sound the same, and he's got a thing for movie's with robots because if i recall he was in irobot also. But that's OK, we love him for Even Stevens.",Eagle Eye

The part that i disliked is that it is an old scenario with a new lookI find this title rather similar to ""Terminator"", in the story, but with the new XXI century, high tech twist.Overall, the movie was enjoyable, and kept the action flowing in a good rhythm, not letting itself being overtaken by the romantic tension, that was kept to acceptable levels (unlike the second title of Matrix).just don't expect a mind puzzling title.",Eagle Eye

Billy Bob Stole the show, but his face looked like a ghost and Rosario Dawson did not look good at all in this film. Make up department should be fired. The film actually had a pretty good sense of humor. I think Mr. LaBouf held his own, but there was not much meat for him to chomp on accept in beginning of film, after that he was along for a ride and just had to look concerned and in disbelief, but he did that well.

Secondly,the story is not bad itself...but there are moments where you get lost a bit,because there is a lot technology stuff we don't know about,and it is mentioned quite often.Other than that,story is great because as far as I can remember it hasn't been used before. Now the most important thing which makes this movie great is the fact that it grabs your attention from its beginning to its end,and I guess that is what everyone is looking for in a movie...

306,arvig,"Mindless, fun in an unintentional comedy sort of way",5,20 December 2008,"Going to make some comments before I post my actual ""review"" (Note quotes): 1) I'm checking off spoiler more to be careful then anything, my comments will contain mild spoilers, not a synopsis of the whole plot.2) I don't often write reviews, so forgive me if I ramble a bit or if this doesn't read like a conventional movie review.Anyway, this movie is basically mindless fluff and fun in an unintentional comedy sort of way. The movie starts off unrealistic and goes to absurd very quickly, and stays there to the very end. In fact, absurd is a strong understatement for a good portion of this film. The plot holes can be sailed through by a small aircraft carrier. But, although I found myself gawking at the TV screen (I watched this on DVD at someone's house three days ago) wondering how much more absurd this film will get, I also found myself able to enjoy it, but only as unintentional comedy. For me, the level of absurdity and the plot holes simply just made it impossible for me to enjoy it as a thriller, or even as an action film.To give an example, instead of going through the ""Rube Goldbergesque"" series of convoluted actions done my Aria, the computer villain of this film, why didn't Aria hire a couple thugs or a Private Eye or some such to capture Jerry, take him to DC and then give him instructions to get to Aria itself? No-one gets killed, no-one but Jerry is involved. One can threaten Jerry via threatening members of his family or his friends playing poker if he refuses to comply, no need to also kidnap the young mother (her character's name already escapes me) and threaten her son to have her along to assist. That's just one of numerous plot holes within the film. There's of course the issue of what if one of the vehicles our two heroes takes breaks down, what if they get fed up, think Aria is bluffing and throw out their cell phones and make a mad dash to the Canadian border (they start out in Chicago, so Canada isn't really that far) and so forth. There's even the characters of Jerry and the young mom being able to hold their own against trained security guards, Jerry doing this a couple more times against other security guards and police officers. Yet they establish that neither character has military or police training, the young mom is well, a young single parent, Jerry is a slacker living in the shadow of his twin brother. One could have easily said that Jerry like his brother joined the military, but simply enlisted, and was discharged unfit for military duty or some such, or a medical discharge or something along those lines. Gives him enough basic training to at least be able to hold his own against people like cops and security guards, without breaking the character being a slacker at all, nor does it make things too absurd, he was just a common grunt before medically or dishonorably discharged. But even little things like that to explain how he could do these things were ignored.Anyway, this film isn't Uwe Bowl absurd or bad. Please don't take my comments in that vein. But it was pretty absurd, and it does show. But, on a ""bad movie night"", it's mindless fun.",Eagle Eye

If the plot had been set 20 years in the future, it might have been more credible, but Jan 2009? However it's one more film criticizing American imperialism and the current government's elimination of civil rights, so it can't be all bad.

310,DaDevster,A high intensity roller coaster ride!,8,29 September 2008,"Eagle Eye, starring Shia LaBeouf and Michelle Monaghan, definitely surpassed my expectations. Seeing previous reviews, and accidentally spoiling the ending, I went in expecting a regular old action flick with a weak plot and bad acting. When I left, I found myself loving the movie.If you go in to Eagle Eye expecting the most true to life portrayal of things and a 100% accurate plot, you'll be sorely disappointed. You mustn't forget that it is indeed a MOVIE and is classified as FICTION for a reason.I loved Eagle Eye for it's amazing acting and immensely intriguing plot. Shia LaBoeuf is spot-on in this movie and is very believable in his parts. The plot, although confusing, is very deep and will definitely have you thinking. Not to say that the movie isn't perfect, however. It seems to fall into the trend of ""Shaky camera during action scenes = Good"" and you'll often find it hard to know what the heck is going on during those parts. I also found the ending a little it weak (I won't spoil it for you though, but for those of you who have seen it you'll know what I'm talking about) and less powerful than it could've been.Despite the flaws, I was still very impressed by this movie.

314,cminor9,a parade of bad clichés. total cacafuego. waste of film. dog poop caught on tape.,1,21 January 2009,"This review contains spoilers. In reality, this movie is SOA (spoiled on arrival.)I saw this movie not knowing anything about the plot. Therefore, the first 45 minutes were actually really interesting. We have the main character, whose name I don't even care to remember. Let's call him Herbert. Herbert was a total screw-up. As the plot evolved, Hermie received a shipment of heavy weaponry at his apartment. Then, Hermosa got all kinds of directions over the phone, from digital signs, anything electronic, who threatened prison or death if he failed to comply. This unknown caller also contacted other people in a similar fashion. The caller seemed to be able to manipulate, well, everything in order to ensure compliance.I was trying to figure out how this was happening. I started thinking some kind of shadow government agency was manipulating people, or that some sinister organization was using people as pawns. Ordinary people were being coerced to perform all kinds of relatively mundane tasks, all of which connected together to accomplish some shadowy objective. I figured the movie would evolve into some sort of social commentary about the surveillance society we now live in, or the ease with which people as a whole can be manipulated.Then, like a baby cockroach hatching from an egg, the plot revealed its ugly self. In a final coup d'fail, this movie used the modern day equivalent of the main character (Hubert) waking up from a dream, or having amnesia, or some other soap opera-worthy plot resolution-evading device: a computer that is so smart it becomes sentient. Egads! You see, the computer becomes sentient and decides to kill government leaders, because, you see, it read the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence and has deemed that the US government is a danger to its founding principles. Social commentary at its most ham-fisted, in other words.And not just any computer, nosiree! Some improbably massive computer that inhabits a cavernous dwelling in a secret level of the Pentagon's basement. You can bet the computer has some totally pointless visual elements, such as a large ""eye"" mounted on an arm that can circle the room. And of course, golden spheres that tap into networked electronic devices such as cameras and phones and so on. And yes, a semi-exotic fluid (liquid nitrogen) is involved.In the final scenes of the movie, you can bet that the hero will have to stab the ""eye"" mounted on the large arm with a crowbar, and someone will have to fall into liquid nitrogen in order to ""kill"" the computer. Well, place your bets cause it all happens. What you don't expect, since the movie is already so cliché ridden, is for our hero Herman to get shot like 50 times by secret service men in the end of the movie only to appear in the next scene wearing the obligatory white sling (like every cop movie where the hero gets shot in some pseudo-cliffhanger and lives.) I mean, he got shot like 50 TIMES!! And yet, there he is standing and smiling in the next scene with a white sling and a presidential medal of honor around his neck.Okay, people...Haven't we seen this plot like 537 times in the last few years? Hell, even Wall-E used the old ""rogue computer"" two-step, but guess what? Wall-E had charisma and it actually worked there.If only I had read the DVD cover first, I could have been spared two hours of my life that could have been better spent cleaning out my toenails, scrubbing the grout in my bathroom tile, using a toothbrush to clean the gunk out of my car's tires, or some other mundane task. Any of which would have been a better use of time than watching this colossal turkey. I mean, some movies are so bad the are funny (see The Core.) This movie is so bad it wraps around twice, right past funny and back to awful. Steven Spielberg is just phoning it in with doggerel like this. Pure cacafuego! This movie made me want to bore my eyes out and stab my brain. It made me want to swallow glass and run my car in my garage for an extended period of time.

316,imdb-17809,This is what is wrong with modern cinema,1,14 November 2008,"This movie is what is wrong with modern cinema. This movie is an insult to the public's intelligence. This movie is crap. First off I'm going to spoil the hell out of this movie because if I succeed in anything here it is to convince you to watch anything else. Watch Madagascar 2 if you have to. I give the movie a free pass on all the fantastic assertions it makes about the capability of computers. This is a supposed high tech, futuristic, super duper secret computer... so anything is possible. HOWEVER: 1) Hollywood needs to get it through their thick skulled craniums that the inclusion a powerful artificial intelligence does not have to always be the big bad wolf... I get the poetic significance of the human spirit vs. the evil machine but it's been done hundreds of times by people far better. Even collectively the writers: John Glenn, Travis Wright, Hillary Seitz, and Dan McDermott are not a tenth of what Kubrick is. 2) If there were such a super computer capable of anything from phone calls, traffic lights, planes, trains, TVs and satellites it seems a little bit difficult to fathom why it would need to recruit two numb skulls to do its bidding. 3) We spend 2 hours watching these two unwittingly participate in an elaborate, explosive (yet oddly perfectly timed) storyline to ultimately fail. Apparently our super computer wasn't smart enough to launch a missile, crash a plane, or any number of far simpler plots to take out our government. In fact... even to take the given storyline for what it was, all that was needed was a necklace and a note to be played at the correct time. We sat through 2 hours to see that complicated circumstance manifest itself? 4) Secret Service shoot to kill, they do not wound or wing or pleasantly ask strange men with guns shooting up the state of the union to please put your gun down. They kill you. Why didn't they? Well that's what big bad evil computers do. People don't kill people, that's just silly. 5) How is it a super dooper future computer with unheard of technology and fabulous artificial intelligence is brought down by a pipe to the eyeball? The thing takes up a 4 story room and its eyeball is the weak spot? Why the hell didn't they just stab it in the eye to begin with?!? I'd give this farce less than one star but Flixter won't let me. I'll be waiting for Eagle Eye 2. A supercomputer writes it and saves us from having to sit through another collaborative effort of the 4 nitwits that gave us this movie.",Eagle Eye

In the end rosario dawson simply sticks a metal rod into the giant ""eagle eye"" that was just unsuspectingly dangling in front of her, and that stops the super intelligent AI completely.. i don't even want to get into why they didn't do something about that earlier. and the whole fiasco about putting the crystal on the lady and the sonic trigger in her son's trumpet.. whoever programmed Aria is retarded and whoever wrote this script is on the same level of IQ as the computer. only props go to billy bob thorton for killing himself, like he should do in every one of his movies.",Eagle Eye

Why do bombs (or is it?) have timers? How is it possible to kill a supercomputer by hitting its webcam? Why does it have a warm woman's voice? Why does it animate around every little thing it's doing other than to explain its actions to a braindead audience? Also, the music does not enhance the 'suspense', it's just very annoying. Been there done that and much, much better was the phrase that came to my mind the most (Matrix, Live free or..., North by North West, Seven, 2010)I did not like the Hal-reference and no, i did not think the name hex for the explosive to be a clever find. I truly wonder if the writer and director know their way around the ""Internets"". And it's not just their incompetence at that terrain: The forced pause in the film's speed (the part in the cargo plane) was unnecessary. And no way could the main characters have survived the fall from the car. No way in hell can an untrained civilian master a presidential guard in hand to hand combat. You begin noticing such things very quickly. Films like this should be about suspension of disbelieve, especially with the amount of money involved and the highly unoriginal theme. Also, the cast is extremely Spielberg: The secretary looks like a guy from one of those terrible cop series, the main actress has been cast as a bad Sandra bullock look-a-like (whose The Net was better), the band leader looks as amiable as Santa Claus and the kid appears to have been cast for his big eyes and freckles. Compared to this film Transformers is a documentary aimed at a mature audience. It's not all bad: the computer's goals are OK, the amount of patriotism is forgivable and the main character actually manages to do a sensible thing to save the day. Volcano was better though. And Meteor. And Terminator III. And Star Wars Episode I-II-III. And so on. What an utter waste of money.",Eagle Eye

It had action-packed sequences, emotional moments, a wonderfully developed plot, and fantastic acting. A number one praise to be mentioned about this movie is the absence of all the sexual and gory filth that movies are absolutely ruined by nowadays.I don't know what is wrong with people today when they can't identify a good movie when they see one. Every single movie ever made can be criticized if you are bent toward doing so. Few movies, however, have the ability to keep the audience at the edge of their seat every moment while not ruining it with meaningless sexual scenes, like Eagle Eye.Go and see it for fun, not as a critic.

As i mentioned the plot was unoriginal and would of been much more interesting if they had just made a 1984 remake.

324,dionkov,Good idea - bad finish,7,19 October 2008,"I have to admit that having in mind the last couple of action movies I have seen, this is the best.The idea of having a supercomputer following and collecting all the information of the population through any device connected to the cloud sounds pretty sane having in mind the technology. We have Google, don't we :)What bothered me was the finish.1st - the idea that the president was guilty for the conflict and that the administration had to be punished is OK. Trying to kill them using a 13 year old - stupid.Even so, it was nice to watch how it helped them to get out from the cops.2nd - Jerry doing dumb stuff:a) opening the boxes and staying in the apartment even after he was warned that the FBI was coming.b) still asking questions once the voice got him out the supposed FBI HQ.c) trying to escape so many times even after seeing what 'she' can do.d) trying to save the administration after learning why the computer wanted them dead.3rd - Rachel doing dumb stuff:a) not going with her son in the first place.b) asking even more questions than Jerry.c) not killing him in the control room while knowing that her son would be killed.d) trying to run for her son when she saw him in the orchestra - what was she trying to prove?4th - Aria doing dumb stuff (for a supercomputer, Aria made a lot of mistakes):a) 'she' could have killed all the people in the list without using the super-explosive, the little boy & his mom.b) letting the agents out of the room and then trying to chase them with explosions while saving the Minister of Defense. She could have kept them there until the show is over and then kill them as opportunities get along.c) trying to kill Jerry and the FBI agent by using the pilot-less plane instead of just making another accident with a truck or something.Here is what looks like a good, or at least logical finish for me:After the scene in which Aria is checking what the agent and the minister are talking in the quiet room, she leaves them there trapped. Rachel kills Jerry knowing the threat hanging on her son. She follows the rules, goes to the concert, the band finishes and everything blows up. After that the minister is released and named president. He admits the mistakes done by the previous administration and some kind of truss with the Arabs.This would certainly show that 'Hey, we make mistakes but we learn from them'. The message from the current ending was 'We do stupid things and we eliminate the evidence so you can't prove it!'",Eagle Eye

Everyone was continuously talking about the pace, casting, directing, and edge of your seat film-making that MAKING a film is truly about.If you go to see movies to be completely enthralled, see this MOVIE. You had to imagine what this was like to read as a script. And just picture the actors continuously flipping through trying to find out what happens next; the same that happened to the audience during this film. Shia is on a whole different level of choices and talent. And frankly for young Hollywood (under 30), there isn't anyone who is taking risks. Or at least no one in the spotlight yet.

There's amazing action scenes, like one of the most intense multiple car wrecks, along with a computerized jet flying into a tunnel to hunt.The acting was some of the best I've seen.

Who's to say your government, or anyone, can't tap into your cell phones at will, even with them turned off by manually patching into the microphone attached inside? A computer that smart could definitely have the ability to categorize certain traits you do within movement and speech to create a personality profile for you..and with a mind of it's own, you wouldn't necessarily know which side it's on, if any.Being that this had almost, equally, a great blockbuster Hollywood feel and a fantastically deep story.

336,rolling_skulls-1,"Some great scenes, great ideas, poor ending",8,12 October 2008,"Not only did I enjoy the movie overall, but there are many things in particular that added to my generally positive review. Admittedly, most of this was in the beginning. The opening scenes were well-shot and well-paced to bring us in and show us just how advanced we could be in tracking a person when we have massive resources at our disposal. The car chase in which the two main characters escape from the authorities was definitely one of the best action scenes I have seen in a very long time. It wasn't overly stylized or anything like that, but really took you in and kept you focused on wondering what's going to happen in the next 5 seconds.The main complaint I have is about the ending, since I feel like it was a stupid way to end such a buildup. This is a computer with almost limitless resources and an ability to analyze far beyond human thinking IMO. The fact that it could not kill Jerry was the first thing that really shook me. Despite him knowing what was going on, I see no reason for the computer to be unable to kill him. Plus, he was able to overtake a trained guard when he has no known training himself and then take his uniform to save the day at the end - that is ridiculous. But besides that, the choice on the part of the writer, director, or whoever to give us a ""happy"" ending really bothered me. I just found Jerry's never-ending luck at the end to be the toughest piece of plot to digest, far more unreasonable than anything else presented in the film.Personally, I would have preferred this ending for what it's worth: Jerry is prevented from stopping the musical performance, whether by being killed or not overtaking the guard. The same scene is shown in the hall, except as the note is played we see the building from the outside zoomed out and a grand explosion occurs. The audience might even be surprised by this since they probably EXPECT everyone to be saved somehow (as the movie makers chose to do instead). Then, we could hear news reporters narrating over, overlapping perhaps, about an explosion taking place and how it's suspected that it is a terrorist group - same group(s) that have been responsible for the retaliation attacks throughout the movie as a result of the initial US attack. The next day we see the new President (Chiklis) being publicly announced as the President, though he looks obviously unhappy knowing the computer did all of this, and later he could sit down with top-ranking officials explaining about the computer and making sure it is never set up for intel like that again (similar to the actual scene he has in the movie).Considering the political tone of the movie, I even think this supports it better. As it stands, the failure of the computer to fix the gov't I guess implies that the people have to take action, but that message is unclear/absent. My alternative ending gives at the very least the same feeling, but also the perspective of the elimination of terrible officials as necessary. I'm not implying killing them, but removal via not re-electing them or however.This is my 2 cents. I still thought the movie was overall very interesting and had lots of good action. I would recommend it despite the frustrating ending.",Eagle Eye
337,genehibberd,"HomeLand Security Act - Also goes by ""The Hollywood Library of Plots Act""",1,28 December 2008,"The film play has been well presented in many other comments, so there won't be that here. The plot is moving along fine on it's own for the first 15 minutes, then it displays unforgivable scenes almost non-stop to the rescue point, which is the end unless you walked out early.The movie's only purpose as I see it, is to launch another Hollywood unsolicited attack on the US military and our common sense. IT IS NOT REALLY ABOUT: ""assassinating anyone; agonizing over ""big brother"" or even giving government officials more interrogation ideas.. It's about ""Water Boarding"". That's right, I said it for you, but we go back. In the first scene, the USA has a terrorist leader in their sights. Now we're to believe it's fine to kill this AK assault rifle carrying Muslim if he's having tea but USA is making a colossal mistake if he's attending a funeral. Now in war, us mortals expect funerals are part of the daily routine. Oops mistake happens. but only because the president overrides a machine. Bad move W, you must die. The guy with the AK was a really a choir boy, no really.Now we all remember the The National Homeland Security and Combating Terrorism Act of 2002. It could have bee called ""The Hollywood Library of Plots Act"". The left knows this is the Boarder Fence of intelligence. The CIA gets to listen in on a very very few inbound calls from terrorist countries to suspected terrorists on our soil. It is effective, like water boarding, and has led to breaking up many attacks before true civilians are killed. For the Left, this will not do. What if a movie had a CIA guy listening to a terrorist on one cell phone and then stopped the crime. Well the CIA guy would be a hero and the military would look good and that film will never be made in California.

343,MikeArrow1020,"All in all, an intelligent thriller and well worth a look.",9,25 September 2008,"Eagle Eye Review - 25/09/08 The entirety of the film ""Eagle Eye"" can be summed up in one word, expansive. Starring Shia LeBeouf and Michelle Monaghan, the production has a cost of over 80 million dollars, with a scope ranging from the Jersey suburbs to Washington DC and even the Pentagon. From the opening scene, a possible sighting of a major terrorist leader, where the US Secretary of Defence (Michael Chiklis) must make a crucial decision regarding the safety of American lives, it is established that eyes are everywhere. There are no places that are safe from some kind of camera or microphone; even mobile phones can be intercepted by the government and used for nefarious ends. It is as a result of this that we are introduced to Jerry Shaw, our protagonist. He's a slacker, self proclaimed ""copy assistant"" and all around underachiever; basically, an everyman of the young Tom Hanks variety. Jerry's brother Ethan (also played by Shia LeBeouf in an actually well done ""identical twin"" scenario) had recently died, leaving Jerry with no family except for his disapproving father, played by William Sadler in what is known as a ""gratuitous cameo"". Being a classic Spielberg notion, parent-child relationships, particularly of the distant father/son kind, are a major theme within Jerry's life.Without giving too much away (the trailers accomplished that rather effectively), Jerry returns home to find his apartment filled with guns, ammunition, ammonium nitrate, and a mobile phone. In short, Jerry is now a threat to the United States government. A mysterious voice informs Jerry that he will be arrested by the FBI within 30 seconds if he does not follow directions exactly. Predicably, and of course inevitably, Jerry is captured and interrogated by the senior director in charge of anti-terrorism, played by Billy Bob Thornton. With the aid of ""the voice"", Jerry escapes and joins fellow recruit Rachel Holloman (Michelle Monaghan) in evading the clutches of the police. Director DJ Caruso (Disturbia) stages a terrifying chase scene, culminating in a truly innovative method of ""auto destruction"". The two pair up for the remainder of the film, oddly enough, neither really subscribes to the traditional ""buddy"" formula. Each is working toward separate goals; Rachel's being the safety of her son, travelling by train to give a performance at the Kennedy Centre for none other than the President of the United States, for once, not a Bush impersonator (read: ""Transformers"").The acting is uniformly terrific. From LaBeouf's tortured twenty-something, fallen in the shadow of his infinitely gifted twin brother, to a chilling turn by Billy Bob Thornton as a no nonsense FBI agent (aren't they all?). Michelle Monaghan deserves particular mention here, as her role is, while not underwritten, could have been severely mismanaged by a lesser actress. As Rachel, Michelle continues her streak of excellent characterisation under pressure. Originating from 2005's Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, continuing through to supporting roles in Gone Baby Gone and Mission: Impossible III (shudder). Rosario Dawson manages stand up to Billy Bob during his utmost ""cranky man"" persona, one thing that most actresses of our time would have a lot of trouble achieving.Dj Caruso, director of Disturbia (also starring Shia LeBeouf), has his hands full with what would seem to be a highly complicated shoot. There are set pieces that rival any modern blockbuster picture, including a tunnel sequence reminiscent of both Mission: Impossible and Live Free or Die Hard. Unfortunately, Mr. Caruso subscribes to the ""shaky cam"" school of action directing, taking a leaf from Rob Cohen (of Mummy 3 fame), Jean Pierre Morel (Taken), David Slade (30 Days of Night), and of course the master of same, Michael Bay (Transformers). This is of course intended to convey a sense of documentary realism and represent the action from the character's point of view. Unlike those previous films listed, the technique actually does work in Eagle Eye, after a fashion. The viewer is disoriented and confused by the fast paced editing and camera moves, but the sheer determination and scale of the situations presented convey such a sense of enormity and scale that we cannot help be impressed by them. See a terrifically tense sequence set in a junkyard where police cars are literally picked up and thrown into the air by massive auto cranes. There's not one steady shot, it's all done hand-held, inside the cars, outside of the windows, back and forth, back and forth, until the cinematographer is either in line for a nervous breakdown or a promotion.Overall, this movie has good acting, a fantastic cast, an excellent script and an above average director. What else can one wish for? A convergence of all these factors forms an excellent, first rate thriller, with a fresh take on what seems to be heavily trod ground at this point. Going back to Coppola's ""The Conversation"", through to Enemy of the State and War Games. Eagle Eye actually takes most of it's inspiration from David Fincher's ""The Game"", where a similar situation occurs when a reclusive millionaire signs up for a purported recreation service, then turned away. In both, neither is aware the game is actually happening until midway through the film, and each is accompanied by an otherwise unrelated proto love interest.All in all, an intelligent thriller and well worth a look.",Eagle Eye

345,dragondx11,Looks good,8,23 September 2008,"Eagle Eye has actors Shia LeBeouf, Rosario Dawson and Michelle Monaghan. Shia Lebeouf started in many good movies like Disturbia ,Transformers, Indy IV and Surf's Up. I'm not sure if Eagle Eye was written specifically for Shia, but the main character JERRY SHAW is the perfect role for Shia's delivery. There is some facetiousness to the character and Shia fits the role perfectly from the characters first lines. It's definitely not hard to imagine Shia in this role if you've seen anything he's done. He can slide in and out of this role with ease, although, the script describes JERRY as 30, handsome and roguish. It'll be hard to spin Shia as 30 because looking 30 is an important part to the character's motivation and choices. As I was reading this, I was finding it very hard to suspend my disbelief that this baby face kid can wind up with the babe who looks twice his age and is well out of his league! I'm sure the producers are taking that into consideration somehow.",Eagle Eye

It is full of great action, with laugh out loud subtle comedy in tense moments. It got the whole theater laughing and inadvertently talking about it making comments, like ""Yeah!"" or ""Awwhhh..."" The ending was a great one, kinda through me off for a minute but it recovered perfectly. The concept behind the movie is also a great conversation sparker for the ride home. It makes you think too. So here are my three key aspects to a great movie which ""Eagle Eye"" fits to a T... 1. Action 2. Mature Humor (Not dirty humor, but not slapstick over the top humor, just humor that it takes some paying attention to understand) 3.

I always enjoy Billy Bob Thornton but thought he should have been given more in this role, I loved his interviewing technique with the security guards. Some of the imagery reminded me of other movies, the pylon scene was so like Seven and of course decommissioning Hal from 2001. The computer was entertainingly 'over the top' and would have looked more at home in a Star Wars film. Here reluctantly is the spoiler, the idea of the computer enforcing the Constitution is the type of realm that has always intrigued me. I felt the film could have explored this a little further, without damaging the blockbuster effect. The computer was a type of Jarret from Les Miserables, existing to enforce an ideal but lacking human sensitivity. As governments implement anti terrorist regulations to combat inhuman terrorists, will everyone else's humanity get buried in the sheer energy of human effort? We can't blame a computer, because we program them. This film did nudge me to that train of thought, but as I said it's always intrigued me. Thanks to D J Caruso for the wild ride.",Eagle Eye

It was full of suspense and mystery which kept me on my toes. I have not seen the theater become so quiet in a long time. During the climax, you could not hear a whisper and you look around and you would see people with their eyes wide open. From the start of the movie, once Jerry received a call giving him the awful news about his twin brothers death, it was action after action. First he gets the calls from a stranger who tells him to run, then before you know it Jerry is jumping out of buildings, going through train and boat rides. Oh man it was a great movie.

It's hard NOT to believe that similar technology exists and is being used. It's just that Edward Snowden hasn't yet spoken about it, that's all. Certainly, Obama's recent speech alluded to such matters.Just think about the spectacular technology and software that's now available in your own PC, Laptop or even Tablet and Smartphone.

If movie producers/directors are going to jump on this bandwagon (knowing that women eat this stuff up, they thrive on it) then I certainly feel I have a right to comment on it. And my comment is this. For all you young gentlemen out there, you can call me bitter, laugh at me, or do whatever you wish, but if you really want to know why dads aren't in their kids lives, don't take it from me, or from some movie dedicated to pulling in the largest female audience possible.

They should have credited Valve... but had they, it would have only tarnished the game.Portal had a female-voiced computer (GlaDOS) run amok, in control of a research facility in which you were a test subject. But Portal did GlaDOS much more intelligently than Eagle Eye did ARIA. GlaDOS was actually likable and encouraging at times, using shame as a control device at others, and always friendly and manipulative. I felt a little ambivalent about disassembling her at the end of the game, even though she was trying to kill Shel.The voice actor the chose for Eagle Eye expressed the human edge of hostility to her subjects, and she just wasn't very polished. I don't think she understood the concept of a helpful machine in error.Sadly, Eagle Eye even seemed to have copied the appearance of GlaDOS. Perhaps an eye orb on a hydraulic arm is an old concept, ARIA looked like a less sophisticated GlaDOS in that elemental particle detector room in Japan.If you've seen this movie (liked it or not) but haven't played Portal, wipe your memory banks of Eagle Eye and pick up a copy of Portal... which is very cheap now.",Eagle Eye

If you want to be repeatedly hit over the head with ideas lifted from great works (and then mangled beyond repair) see Eagle Eye. With Shia LaBeouf and Michelle Monaghan in starring roles that's all you can expect. The conspiracy drama in the trailers is just a setup for action scenes and the two costars initially hating but forced to rely on each other due to extreme circumstances and thus growing closer. So what is the throwaway conspiracy drama plot? Aliens abduct the president's brain and they're the only who can get it back! No wait, that's too plausible. An omniscience, and possibly omnipotent, voices orders the two from point A to B threatening their lives and loved ones. Really, that's enough information to figure out the major twist.So Shia Lebouf is accused of terrorism, acts dumb, mourns his twin, whines with Michelle Monaghan. Monaghan's son is threatened, which makes her character a bit more believable, acting as a frantic parent. Both are pursued by various law and order types including Billy Bob Thorton, who is channeling Tommy Lee Jones' performance from the Fugitive but only ends up slightly amusing.Very peripheral to this mayhem are a few brown people but no one cares about them so they're killed immediately after they become expendable. Law enforcement types intimidate, Civilians act like chickens running around with their heads cut off, military personnel improvise, no one has a plan, everyone's reacting. In this chaos it almost makes sense to obey a phone call that says ""Jump out off the building, now"". It's probably the director since that's when the action starts.Unfortunately, the action is the typical ""shaky cam"" which makes it impossible to tell what's happening on screen during a car chase, gunfight, foot chase, or conveyor belt chase and that's my biggest disappointment about the movie. ""Shaky cam"" is really annoying when you can't tell who's punching who or which cars were smashed in a high speed pursuit. SPOILERS In real life, Predator drones are really cool military hardware that do amazing things but they are used stupidly in the movie. The movie is set in 2009 yet everything, and i mean everything is hooked up to the internet for the omniscience voice's control. Finally, the omniscience voice is an infallible ally at the beginning and an non-factor after switching sides, a plot point that's hard to believe considering what it did in the first half. /SPOILERS In the end, the worst part about this movie was considering all the better books, movies, and games that have been skimmed to make a serviceable Frankenstein monster to further catapult Shia LaBeouf's star. Isaac Asimov's short story ""All the Troubles in the World"" incorporates the conspiracy plot, the twist, and a final, further twist that leaves an impression. Valve Studios ""Portal"" has an omniscience voice with much better dialog and a final fight that is much more satisfying. Tom Clancy's ""Debt of Honor"" has a much more exciting attack on the Capitol. The Bourne Trilogy has better plotted chase scenes (although they still use shaky cam). Children of Men has the most jaw dropping (sans shaky cam) action scenes in the last five years. There are any number of articles describing the use of Predator drones in the field, including a short sidebar in the August 2006 issue of the Atlantic. 24 has better scenes of rogue law enforcement and the military complex getting things done. Nick of Time with Johnny Depp and 24 with Jack Baeur were both parents forced to commit high crimes while their children were held hostage. There are any number of better conspiracy movies and books but i'll be old school and pick The Manchurian Candidate. There is an anti-American imperialism moral which bookends the movie but MAJOR SPOILER The government's only fault in the movie seems to be putting their trust in a omniscience AI computer. /MAJOR SPOILER Shut down the computer and civil liberties are restored! Except Guantanamo Bay is still there, the NSA wiretapping of American citizens is still pardoned, suspension of habeas corpus is only a concern for Middle-Eastern people, and circumvention of the FISA courts is an issue for those in favor of judicial activism. Yes, those statements in the preceding sentence were sarcasm. I had some fun from this movie; as Anton Ego would say ""We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read"".

It is powerful enough to take over any networked piece of equipment, devise a plan involving a sonically triggered bomb, and coerce people into doing its bidding. It is powerful enough to control military jets so precisely that it can fly them through tunnels. It is not, however, powerful enough to use a military jet to kill a driver in said tunnel. Nor is it powerful enough to recognize that waiting until a dramatic note in the anthem might be a poor choice to detonate its bomb. Nor does it seem to realize that it could just use the military jet to take out its actual targets. And lastly, it lacks the power to carry out its mission directly because of a voice order, but still possesses the ability to kill the issuer of the order, and con his twin into overriding it.Thornton's acting is pretty good. Everyone else is passable (though maybe only by comparison to the rest of the movie). The execution of the movie is mostly quite nice, although one wonders how a jet flying after a car seems to gain no ground.I do not recommend this movie for anyone who demands a modicum of intelligence or consistency from their fare. If, however, you are capable of separating your intellect from the part of you that enjoys explosions, as completely as the filmmakers did, it may be for you.",Eagle Eye

374,h-star-37468,could have been so much better,6,16 April 2018,"You can see that some thought was put into the unusual premise and how it all could play out - but for some reason, instead of creating another movie as excellent as the matrix, it turned into 80% action and 20% actual plot.",Eagle Eye
