0,MartinHafer,"Good for the 70s but a far, far cry from classic Disney",5,31 December 2014,"""Robin Hood"" is a very dull film but one that kids will no doubt enjoy. I think much of this is because kids don't think like many adults. Many adults will see the film and think ""wow....this is not nearly as good as the REALLY good Disney films like BAMBI, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST and LITTLE MERMAID""--but I cannot imagine most 6-8 year-olds thinking this way. Nor can I imagine most kids hating the music--although lines like ""Oodelally, Oodeelally Golly What a Day"" are truly insipid and annoying. And, kids won't likely think ""Wow...the classic Warner Brothers film with Errol Flynn is a bazillion times better than this dull picture""--but this is clearly true. My feeling is that this film is a great way to illustrate the doldrums in which Disney Studio was in at the time. The film simply isn't in the same league as their better films.",Robin Hood
1,TheLittleSongbird,Truly entertaining!,8,26 February 2009,"Robin Hood mayn't have the direct charm or the memorable songs of the later Disney movies, but it is solid entertainment nonetheless. The animation is generally lovely, if slightly archaic which is a style I kind of like, but the story sometimes fails to engage being fairly episodic but this is only occasionally. But the action highlight was the archery contest, which was so funny, as was the witty and delightful script. The songs are not as memorable as the ones in Beauty and the Beast, but they are still lovely. ""Love"" is a beautiful song, but my favourite was ""Phony King of England"" because of the funny lyrics. The only song I didn't like as such was the rather annoying song in the opening credits, which were a bit long. As for the characters, I loved the fact, the animators made the legendary characters animals. The best ones were Prince John and Sir Hiss, who were an absolutely hilarious double act, especially when Prince John sucks his thumb, the only villain to do that. Peter Ustinov and Terry Thomas were superb supplying the voice overs. Robin and Little John were also entertaining, as well as the Sheriff of Nottingham. Casting Phil Harris as Little John was genius, after his incredible voice-over as Baloo in the Jungle Book. I particularly loved the line ""I'm Sir Reginald, duke of Chutney"". I know in some scenes, they looked as though they were running out of ideas, but they weren't. They were just looking for a bit of inspiration. In conclusion, a really entertaining animation, that couldn't really live up to the Jungle Book. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Robin Hood
2,Leofwine_draca,Much better than expected,6,28 May 2017,"ROBIN HOOD is a Disneyfied version of the popular folk legend, positing the various familiar characters as various animals. Thus Robin himself is a charming fox, and one of the villains is a lisping snake played by the great Terry-Thomas. Overall I found this to be a much better production than expected given its reputation; the music is toe-tappingly good and the voice actors work hard to add emotion and meaning to their voices. There's little to complain about regarding the old-fashioned animation, which has real character. Peter Ustinov is a particularly oily delight as the villain of the piece. The plot moves along at a fair old whack and it's all very light-hearted and comedic without being silly or juvenile. In fact, it might just be one of the most entertaining Robin Hood films to come out of Hollywood.",Robin Hood
3,SnoopyStyle,second tier Disney,7,30 July 2018,"It's the classic Robin Hood characters as animal characters in a Disney animation. While it is a classic, it's at a time in between the traditional Disney classics and the newer classics like Beauty and the Beast. It doesn't have a catchy tune to hang on to. The music is mostly country folk genre and doesn't have the pop punch. The animation is traditional and bright. While it's not breaking any new grounds, it does have the charms of traditional hand drawn Disney. I do love the character designs. Robin Hood himself lacks a certain charisma. Brian Bedford is a Shakespearean actor which leaves the lead feeling old fashion and old. Overall, this is a fun little adventure for the little ones but one that is mostly forgettable for older teens or adults. Honestly, I don't remember much soon after watching it except for the often-done archery competition. This is definitely a second tier Disney.",Robin Hood
4,Hitchcoc,Done to Death,7,6 September 2017,"There have been so many treatments of the Robin Hood legend. In this animated one, we are serenaded by the wonderful Roger Miller (who died way too soon). He plays a singing rooster. The plot is the old Sheriff of Nottingham going after the poacher and thief, Robin Hood. Robin wins the big archery tournament and hooks up with Maid Marion (they are both foxes or there would be some issues here). Of course, Prince John and the Sheriff will stop at nothing to get their man and use the threatened hanging of Friar Tuck to draw our amazing archer into the open. There's no question how this ends. The animation is truly striking and it's a nice story. You will recognize some of the voices though we must go back some time.",Robin Hood
5,gavin6942,Good Fun,6,14 March 2015,"The story of the legendary outlaw is portrayed with the characters as humanoid animals.This is a story well known but a film probably not often watched. Ranking the Disney cartoons best to worst, this would be lucky to end up somewhere in the middle. Not that it is all bad, but it has been overshadowed by its successors. We still get Phil Harris, Terry-Thomas and some fun characters. Not to mention the song that would inspire ""The Hamster Dance"" decades later.Those from Wisconsin will be a bit surprised and excited to hear the tune of ""On Wisconsin"" during a football scene. Was someone in the music department a University of Madison graduate?",Robin Hood
6,lee_eisenberg,"Still, I prefer Errol Flynn and Cary Elwes.",5,27 November 2006,"When I was young, my favorite scene in Disney's version of ""Robin Hood"" was always the battle following archery tournament (you gotta admit, it would be cool to experience that). Otherwise, it seems like the whole thing is sort of a Disney movie: a classic story turned into a jolly musical, with some comic relief here and there.So, it's not a terrible movie. I just prefer the Errol Flynn version, and Mel Brooks's spoof of the Kevin Costner version (plus the short cartoons starring Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck). OK for some brief entertainment.So yes, let's point that pea-shooter the other way.",Robin Hood
7,jboothmillard,Robin Hood,6,19 September 2005,"Before I heard of the Kevin Costner and Errol Flynn versions of the classic legend story of the man who stole from the rich and gave to the poor, there was this cartoon version by Walt Disney Pictures, with the interesting idea of animals playing the characters. I obviously liked it when I was a kid, but I saw it not too long ago, and it is just a bit corny and more aimed at kids. Anyway, it brings back singer Phil Harris from The Aristocats and The Jungle Book, as Little John. It also introduces Brian Bedford as Robin Hood. There are some good moments of cartoon like comedy, but again, more for kids. Also starring Peter Ustinov as Prince John and tom thumb's Terry-Thomas as Sir Hiss. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for ""Love"". Good!",Robin Hood
8,Tweekums,Disney's anthropomorphic adaption of the classic story,8,22 April 2019,"This Disney adaption of the Robin Hood story sees each of the characters portrayed by animals but keeps the basics of the story. Robin, along with his friend Little John, 'borrow' from the wealthy to help the poor and there is nobody more deserving of being robbed than Prince John; a character who is constantly raising the taxes for the ordinary people. After being robbed the Prince plans to trap Robin Hood with an archery competition. When that fails and the people start mocking him even more he raises taxes yet again and has Robin's friend Friar Tuck gaoled... of course it is only a matter of time before Robin is planning a rescue.I know that many people consider this to be a weaker Disney production but I rather enjoyed it. I recalled watching it as a child but didn't remember too much about it other than the fact that Robin Hood was a fox and that I'd enjoyed it. Watching it again forty five years later it still entertained me. The story may be pared to the basics but that is ideal for a younger audience. The characters are introduced in a good way; the heroes are suitably heroic without losing the common touch and the villains are bad but with traits that ensure that they won't scare younger viewers... who can be scared of a lion who sucks his thumb! The story provides plenty of solid child-friendly action and some good laughs; it also provides some more downbeat moments as we see the people suffering under John's tax regime. There are the expected songs; they may not be classics but they are fun enough. Having the characters portrayed as animals was rather fun; this was helped by a solid voice cast that included Peter Ustinov, as King John, and Terry Thomas as is sidekick Sir Hiss, a snake. The rest of the cast are solid too; some viewers might not be keen on the mix of English and American voices but it didn't really bother me... who knows what people of that time actually sounded like?! Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of animated films that are suitable for all ages.",Robin Hood
9,ma-cortes,"Animated version based on famous character filled with musical numbers , entertainment and fun",7,30 December 2012,"Again Robin Hood and his Merry Men but this time they are a menagerie! The story of the legendary outlaw is portrayed with the characters as humanoid animals . Classic version based on the legendary character with exciting adventures , breathtaking animated battles and load of action and romance . Greatest adventure of the centuries ¡ , greatest thrill of the screen ¡ an adventure the world has thrilled to for centuries , in a picture it will never forget . He lives again , a hero of every villain , friend to those who have friends . In 13th century England , dashing Robin (voice of Brian Bedford ,Tommy Steele was the original choice to perform the voice of the title character, but he was dropped shortly after recording sessions began) and his band of marauders confront general oppression and corruption of wicked Sheriff Nottingham (a wolf ,was originally a goat and voice by Buttram) , leading an uprising against the crown that will forever alter the balance of world power , foiling evil Prince John . When the Norman Lords begin oppressing the Saxon masses in King Richard's absence , a Saxon archer named Robin Hood fights back as the outlaw leader of a rebel guerrilla army . The legendary Sherwood forest's hero Robin Locksly again and Lady Marian (lovely Maid Olivia De Havilland) along with his Merrie men brought by him : Friar Tuck (voice by Andy Devine) and Little John (voice by Phil Harris). Robin Hood (a fox) , Little John (a brown bear) and Friar Tuck (originally, was to be a pig, but was changed to a badger to avoid insulting religious sensibilities) cleverly revolt against over-taxation carried out by the king John Without Land and other royal men. Robin wins the heart of royal ward Marian (a vixen with voice of Monica Evans) . While there is organized an archery tournament held by Prince John, with the winner receiving a kiss from Maid Marian . This cartoon/swashbuckler has great animated sequences well staged with stylish and vitality , adventure , romance , outstanding final dueling and is pretty entertaining . An imaginative and jolly Disney adaptation of the Robin Hood legend with brilliant drawings and catching score by George Bruns . There are great songs , enjoyable action sequences in forests and castle , including amusing ending confrontation at the climax of the film .Initially, the studio considered a movie about the European fable, Reynard the Fox. However, due to Walt Disney's concern that Reynard was an unsuitable choice for a hero, Ken Anderson used many elements from it in Robin Hood. Robin Hood, also known Robin O'Locksley and the Earl of Huntingdom, is probably and sadly a creation of romantic imaginations . The motion picture was well directed by Wolfgand Reitherman , a good craftsman from Disney factory .He often animated fast action sequences or dances , and known for ""re-using"" animation from older films and placing them in newer films . He co-directed several Disney movies such as Aristocats , Jungle Book , 101 Dalmatians , Peter Pan , Cinderella , Dumbo , among others .The story is indirectly based on historic events and is developed after third Crusade when Richard Lion Heart abandoned Holy Land . If Robin Hood did exist, it's almost certain that he was not a Saxon , though his enemies may well have been the Norman sheriff of Nottinghan and Prince and later king John Lackland.In route England Richard was captured by Leopold II of Austria and ransomed by his own subjects . But Richard returns England to put down a revolt against him though his brother John without Land takes over the kingdom with his underling evil Sheriff of Nottingham . Though Richard eventually returned from battle and foiled John's rebellion, John eventually became king anyway after Richard's untimely death (1199) in battle without an heir. Queen Eleanor supported John against rival claimants until her death in 1204. Other versions about this famous personage are the following : the classical (1936) ¨The Adventures of Robin Hood ¨ by Michel Curtiz with Errol Flynn , Olivia De Havilland , Basil Rathbone , Alan Hale , ¨Robin Hood and his Merrie men ¨(1952) by Ken Annakin with Richard Todd and Peter Finch ; ¨Sword of Sherwood Forest (1960) by Terence Young with Richard Greene , Richard Pasco and Peter Cushing ; ¨Robin Hood price of thieves (1991) ¨ by Kevin Reynolds with Kevin Costner , Alan Rickman and Morgan Freenan , the same year was exhibited ¨Robin Hood¨ by John Irvin with Patrick Bergin and Uma Thurman but was a flop though the critics considered best adaptation . Furthermore , recent and revisionist version titled ¨Robin Hood¨(2010) by Ridley Scott with Russell Crowe , Cate Blanchet and Oscar Isaac .",Robin Hood
10,Quinoa1984,"it's less than great, but I liked watching it as a kid",8,23 November 2006,"I wouldn't recommend the Disney animated 70s movie of Robin Hood as essential Disney, but I have some great memories of it as a kid anyway. If there's any one thing I could probably criticize it's the song numbers- they just don't work and lack the fine polish of the Sherman brothers collaborations. Looking back on it it's very dated in that respect, sort of serving to the kids of the moment in part, and even to the point of reusing actual dancing bits from the Jungle Book (if you've seen these movies as much as I have you start to notice these things). And as far as energy goes it's sometimes pretty lackadaisical. This being said, I also found a lot of it to be very funny, with the interplay between Peter Ustinov and Terry Thomas is fantastically good- they're such laughable villains, yet when they do strike their irons down it goes pretty dangerously. Of course you wont find anything at all in way of getting at all into the character underneath their basic demeanors- Robin Hood and those on his side, good, Prince John and those on his side, bad. But within those boundaries there is entertaining stuff going around, with the first robbing of Prince John through the very cheap disguise Robin puts on one, and another when Little John disguises himself as a Duke. Again, nothing immediately noteworthy, but as a kid I found a lot to go on it, with the more cartoonish aspects of the villains and side character outweighing the weaker sections of music and song, stale Robin and Mariam parts, and so on.",Robin Hood
11,tavm,Walt Disney Productions' Robin Hood was one of the pretty entertaining animated efforts made after the founder's passing,7,3 July 2016,"After years of only watching bits and pieces of this movie, I finally watched the entirety of this on a recent flight from Korean Air. Made after Walt Disney's death, it still had many of his old crew involved making this quite entertainingly funny to watch. All the characters of the Robin Hood tale are portrayed as various forest animals with the leading character and his leading lady being foxes. This marked Phil Harris' third and final voice role in a Disney movie, having previously been such in The Jungle Book (Uncle Walt's last in the animated category) and The AristoCats. Roger Miller contributed some songs and also voiced a character though the tune that got an Oscar nomination-""Love""-was written and performed by someone else. Overall, Robin Hood was a nice movie to watch on a flight back home...",Robin Hood
12,hitchcockthelegend,Merry Menagerie!,8,4 May 2014,"Disney take on the Robin Hood legend in animation form with family friendly rewards aplenty.Directed and produced by Wolfgang Reitherman (Sleeping Beauty/The Jungle Book), the voice work comes from Brian Bedford (Robin Hood), Phil Harris (Little John), Monica Evans (Maid Marian), Peter Ustinov (Prince John), Terry-Thomas (Sir Hiss), Andy Devine (Friar Tuck), Roger Miller (Allan-A-Dale), Pat Buttram (Sheriff of Nottingham) and Carole Shelley (Lady Cluck).All the characters are drawn as animals, with Robin suitably given a fox make-over, plot revolves around the dastardly machinations of Prince John and the Sheriff of Nottingham. Who find themselves hindered considerably by Robin and his band of merry men. Meanwhile Robin and Marian are rekindling their romance on the sideline. It lacks the class of other Disney animation movies, with no songs of note to tap the feet to, but the action is strong (love the archery), Prince John and Sir Hiss are great comedy value, and ultimately it's a delightful retelling of an often told wonderful legend. 8/10",Robin Hood
13,CinemaSerf,"""There's something funny going on around here...""",7,2 April 2020,"This probably stands out as the first time I really noticed Disney turn to cast an ensemble of more established ""stars"" as their voice talents - a wonderfully paired duo of Peter Ustinov and Terry-Thomas as Prince John and ""Sir Hiss"" as well as Phil Harris as ""Little John"" and ""King of the Road"" crooner Roger Miller narrating the whole tale as ""Alan-a-Dale"" really do animate this story splendidly. Everyone knows the story of Robin Hood - the gent of 12th century English folklore. When the King heads off to fight the Saracens in the crusades, his evil brother remains to extort all he can from the poor population whilst Robin Hood leads the rebellion against this tyrannical regime. The personifications of animals in this film is a masterstroke - and the choice of animals: a snake, fox, bear, lion, badger and even a tortoise all add hugely to the symbolism and fun of this thoroughly enjoyable rendering of the ultimate good v evil tale. I always seem to have a problem with the intrusive scores in Disney's animations - it never seems to let up long enough to let the voices take centre stage, and as such is quite distracting much of the times. That said, I am nit-picking - aside from a rather protracted musical interlude - the action animations are first class and this is a cracking film.",Robin Hood
14,Bunuel1976,"ROBIN HOOD (Wolfgang Reitherman, 1973) **1/2",6,24 January 2010,"It was perhaps inevitable for the Walt Disney Studios to make an antropomorphic animated feature out of the adventures of the legendary Sherwood Forest outlaw, yet rather superfluous considering their own superior 1952 live-action rendition (with which I also intend to re-acquaint myself this Christmas – particularly in view of star Richard Todd's recent passing). In spite of the film's somewhat maligned reputation as the unit's least effort from the 1970s, I used to like this one as a kid and, to be fair, it remains eminently watchable (if hardly stimulating) even now – thanks largely to the enthusiastic voice 'performances' of Peter Ustinov as Prince John (depicted as a lion and, amusingly, a mama's boy!) and Terry-Thomas as his reptilian (thus a snake, appropriately named Sir Hiss) but long-suffering sidekick/patsy. In typical Disney fashion, however, the obligatory romance is a drag (while also throwing in a bit of 'child' interest); similarly, the oppression of Prince John's rule is treated with excessive sentimentality. That said, Robin (in the guise of a fox) is suitably wily when dealing with John, Hiss and the Sheriff Of Nottingham (appearing in the form of a wolf) – notably when he robs the royal carriage (dressed up as a gypsy), the famed archery contest (with his features hidden under a stork's countenance) and the finale in which the Prince's income is pinched en masse and swung along ropes from his balcony. As for the ""Merrie Men"", Little John is a bear (voiced by Phil Harris, in a virtual reprise of his Baloo characterization from THE JUNGLE BOOK [1967] – the film, in fact, feels closest to this one in style and approach), Friar Tuck a badger (dialogue spoken by Andy Devine) and Allen-a-Dale a crooning rooster who also acts as Chrous to the proceedings. Incidentally, though an icky love song (unimaginatively called ""Love"") may have been intended as the musical centerpiece here, Little John's bouncy ""The Phony King Of England"" and Allen-a-Dale's wistful ""Not In Nottingham"" are actually much more rewarding numbers.",Robin Hood
15,utgard14,"""Oh, he's so handsome. Just like his reward posters.""",7,12 August 2014,"Charming Disney version of the Robin Hood tale. With animals in place of humans, of course. The voice work is great. The animation is modest but nice. The music is quite fun. I liked all of the songs, particularly the folksy country ones. It moves along at a leisurely pace. Probably better suited for teens and adults than little kids. This one doesn't have the strongest reputation. I can't help but feel it's a little under-appreciated. I watched this movie quite a bit growing up. I realize it may seem a little flat to kids who grew up in the Pixar era, but I hope they can appreciate these older Disney cartoons. They may not be as flashy as today's animated movies but they are still very entertaining, quality productions.",Robin Hood
16,grantss,Sweet little Disney children's classic,7,10 April 2015,"Sweet little Disney children's classic.Directed by Wolfgang Reitherman, who also directed The Jungle Book, 101 Dalmatians and The Aristocats, Robin Hood is one of the quintessential children's movies. Has a sweet, often funny story, with the characters portrayed by animals. Adults however, may find the plot a bit basic. Still good fun though.Where Robin Hood doesn't reach the same level of class as The Jungle Book, however, is in the music. Every song on The Jungle Book was catchy and incredibly memorable. Robin Hood's music just isn't in the same league, and feels flat and insignificant. This, despite enlisting the musical talents of Roger Miller for a few of the songs.Overall, worth the watch, no matter what your age.",Robin Hood
17,evanston_dad,One of My Favorite Disney Cartoons,8,8 June 2007,"I LOVED this cartoon as a kid. I was and am an animal lover anyway, so the idea of Sherwood Forest being populated by a bunch of talking animals delighted me.My favorite characters were Prince John, the hapless lion with his crooked crown, and his right-hand man (or snake), Sir Hiss. I especially enjoyed Prince John's unique way of robbing ladies of their rings, which was to suck them off their fingers while he was pretending to kiss their hands.The highlight of the film is the famous archery contest that turns into a wild and crazy football game. All these years later, I wonder if that section of the film was tipping its hat to the equally delirious football game in ""MASH."" Grade: A",Robin Hood
18,bombersflyup,Mostly dull.,2,23 July 2018,"Robin Hood is a weak animation, my memory of it far exceeded anything it had to offer.It's a bit of a musical.

20,Smells_Like_Cheese,Disney's most under rated film,10,10 February 2004,"Robin Hood is personally one of my favorite Disney movies of all time, it's one of those animated films that gets over looked or over shadowed by other Disney classics, I wish it did get more notice. The animation is great and just has that old feel to it when animators used to draw the pictures, it feels more personal and special that way. Not to mention that this was a great adaptation of the Robin Hood story for the kids. Even as an adult I still enjoy watching this movie, it's funny, romantic, touching, and just very entertaining to watch. How could you not love Prince John? He is one of Disney's most awesome and hilarious villains of all time! Granted I know this film can come off as a little corny, but seriously give this movie a chance, it's one of Disney's buried treasures.The story begins as Robin Hood and Little John run from the Sheriff of Nottingham, who has ambushed them with a team of archers. After narrowly escaping, Robin Hood and Little John happen upon the royal entourage which is taking Prince John and his counselor, Sir Hiss, to Nottingham in order to tax the people there. Disguised as female fortune-tellers, Robin and Little John effectively steal all the gold they can carry and run off into the forest, leaving Prince John sucking his thumb in humiliation. In Nottingham, Robin uses Friar Tuck to smuggle the stolen gold back to the peasants. Later Robin sees Maid Marian, she and Robin had once been sweethearts as children, but were forced to part ways when she moved to London. But she is mistaken: Robin can't stop thinking about her. But since Robin is an outlaw he and Marian wait for marriage. Seething with rage, that Robin is winning, John triples the taxes, making the bleak situation in Nottingham even worse. One night, Robin Hood, disguised again as the beggar, learns that Friar Tuck is in jail and will rescue him, save Nottingham once and for all and give Prince John the justice that has been coming to him for a long time.I can't tell you how much I love this film, I think my favorite scene will always be the archery scene. Robin Hood learns that there is an archery contest and the winner gets a kiss from Maid Marian, so he enters and goes in a disguise, and Little John had his back the whole time while getting Prince John to lighten up about Robin being in the contest. I also love Prince John's side kick, Sir Hiss, he's the perfect little sleaze bag tattle tail and we go in Tom and Jerry classic mode when Prince John has it with him and just ties Hiss's body in a knot. This is a terrific Disney movie, just trust me when I say that it's a lot of fun to watch and just enjoy it, we don't get films like this any more.10/10",Robin Hood
21,DKosty123,Excellent Animated Robin of Sherwood,8,3 March 2007,"To introduce your children to the Robin Hood story, this one does a very good job. There are many qualities it has that make a child want to watch it over & over again. This is the official Disney animation of the Sherwood Forrest bandits.The Roger Miller soundtrack is great, & even adults can appreciate what the old King of The Road singer put into composing his songs for this movie. The music is contemporary & catchy. Phil Harris has a great song in it too. The music appeals to everybody.Add to that, a lot of fine voices for the animated cast in this one. This is one of the first animated films that really got a lot of good celebrity voices. Some of the animated sequence drawings very much resemble the live action ones in the 1938 classic too.The story is told slightly differently & the script actually has some real fun with the characters & brings the story to a new lifestyle as Robin Hood is a fox in this story.My favorite quote in this one is from Friar Tuck, ""Parise the Lord & pass the tax rebates!"".",Robin Hood
22,Rainey-Dawn,Oo-De-Lally What A Movie!,10,4 July 2014,"A very cute version of the Robin Hood tale. It's hilarious when it should be and feels very melancholy at the appropriate times. Disney did so well to capture the emotions of the characters that you can almost feel them yourself. A very comical movie.The musical numbers are good... the songs work well with the scenes and are not bad to listen to for a Disney family film. I used to try to whistle Roger Miller's ""Oo-De-Lally"" to my cockatiel who in turn would try to whistle it back to me. LOL, it's quite a catchy little ballad.This is an all time favorite Disney animation for me. I loved it as a kid and I still love it today. I can still laugh every time I watch this movie or even just thinking about it I can bust-a-gut with laughter.10/10",Robin Hood
23,KineticSeoul,A really good showing of the Robin Hood story from Disney,8,27 September 2014,"This is animated telling of the Robin Hood story, and it's executed really well. I think it was a brilliant idea to make the characters into an animated animal form. It really does add to the more light- hearted feel of things. Robin Hood is how he should be, with his charm, wit and slyness. However the villains which include Prince John and his companions are just super incompetent, cowardly and dumb. To the point it's kind of difficult to really dislike them. Except maybe for the snake. Which does get kind of tedious after a while, because everything just seems one sided. But I guess the Disney team did the best they could with the running time and development. It's just cool to see Robin Hood all sly and mischievous while doing some rebellious tasks again Prince John and his men. Overall this is a entertaining and well made Robin Hood adaptation from Disney.8.5/10",Robin Hood
24,OllieSuave-007,Legendary outlaw in a daring Disney film!,7,25 February 2015,"This is Walt Disney's 21st full-length animated feature film, where the fox hero Robin Hood and his bear sidekick Little John set out on a daring adventure to give money to the poor residents of Sherwood Forest. In doing so, they try to outwit the greedy lion Prince John and the cold-hearted wolf, the Sheriff of Nottingham, and stop them from suppressing the poor.This movie starts off with a captivating intro where Prince John had his brother, King Richard, hypnotized so he could rule the land in his place. This all leads to Prince John being outsmarted by a disguised Robin Hood and Little John in some jewels, resulting in a widespread manhunt for the outlaw.While this film has a basic and predictable plot and is slow at certain points, the story is actually quite entertaining and imaginatively fun - especially in seeing all the animals take on the roles of a legendary human tale and trying to survive a tax assault by the unscrupulous king and his cohorts. There are some great adventures and action - great excitement for the kids. There are also some humor that even adults might find enjoyable.The animation was pretty good, not as vibrant as earlier films or in later films of the 80s and 90s, but it is serviceable. The songs by Roger Miller has a nice country and comfortable feel to it and the music score by George Bruns is top-tapping fun and intriguing. Wolfgang Reitherman did a nice job directing and Larry Clemmons and the story team gave us quite a captivating screenplay.Overall, it's an adventurous Disney movie with a predictable plot, but has that certain charm and special ""Disney touch"" that the entire family would enjoy.Grade B",Robin Hood
25,ElMaruecan82,"A charming, hilarious and exciting Medieval Zoo ...",9,8 November 2013,"It seems like the same pattern governing Walt Disney's animated movies released between the 'Golden Age' (from ""Snow White"" to ""Cinderella"") and the 'Renaissance' (from ""The Little Mermaid"" to ""Tarzan"").First, they're inevitably compared with their glorious predecessors hence rarely meeting with the critics' expectations of something on the same league than ""Bambi"" or ""Fantasia"". However, in their mighty magnanimousness, they reckon the entertaining value of the film and never doubt its capability to please each member of the family. And rightfully so, the film meets with popular success and becomes a box-office hit, generally throning on every year's podium. And a few decades later, the film is an instant classic.What I just described applies to ""The Jungle Book"", ""The Aristocats"", ""One Hundred and One Dalmatians"" and ""Robin Hood"" is hardly an exception. The adaptation of Walter Scott's novel (or the animated remake of the Errol Flynn classic) carries the mark of that particular period where low-budgeted Disney studios recycled old footage and reused the same animation in different scenes –I thought the most blatant case was ""The Sword in the Stone"" but ""Robin Hood"" isn't beyond reproach either- at the end, we get a rather rudimentary approach to animation which isn't on the same vein than blah-blah-blahI stop here, because I'm bored by my own review, as if the very rationality I'm expressing was depressing both the little kid I was and the grown-up I became, as both saw the film with equals levels of excitement, fun and enthusiasm. So, if ""Robin Hood"" offers a fair share of action, humor, music and romance, that anyone would expect from a Disney film, do any technical consideration matter? ""Robin Hood"" has always been a cheerful legend, the iconic outlaw who stole from the rich to give to the poor is such a flamboyant, rebellious and romantic hero I could never picture him without a smile on his face, whether from Douglas Fairbanks, Errol Flynn or Disney's fox. The stroke of genius is to populate the film with anthropomorphic animals, which has never been done before, even in ""Lady and the Tramp"" and ""The Jungle Book"", animals were still coexisting with men.In ""Robin Hood"", it's a whole medieval zoo created with the perfect animal for each character. The hero is as clever, fast, agile and intelligent as a fox, his strong and jovial friend is a bear and the victims of Prince John's tyranny are all fragile and weak animals: owls, rabbits, mice or raccoons. As for the villains, the treacherous sheriff is a wolf, the Prince, naturally is a lion but deprived from the obligatory mane as to emphasize his immaturity, his counselor is sneaky like a snake, his troop is made of elephants and rhinoceros lead by a raspy-voiced crocodile.(And now that I think about it, I noticed that the good guys are all animals from the farm or forest and the bad ones from the jungle, as if it had to show the poor habitants of Nottingham as the unfortunate preys of greedy predators (Little John is a bear but bears have sweeter tastes), as if dictatorship was the only the socialized version of the 'law of the jungle'.) It's obvious that since the creation of Mickey Mouse, Disney films could never do without animals, even ""The Sword in the Stone"", which was set in the same period than ""Robin Hood"" approximately, featured many sequences where Merlin and Arthur were turned ones. My guess is that it probably has to do with the wide range of animation it offers and the way animals enhance children's imagination with a great use of colors and diversity in movements drawings. This is the main appeal of ""Robin Hood"" and had the film featured humans, I don't think I would have cared much about it when I first saw it at the age of 5.I remember the film was recorded from an Italian channel and I could hardly understand a word, but with this unique touch of marvel animators' magic hand bring to their film, the whole adventure excited me. As a teenager, I still loved it, and as an adult, I started to notice that the film carries many pleasantly surprising aspects.""Robin Hood"" is perhaps the first film to talk about 'having children', 'marriage', some cute naughty innuendo like when a rhino whistles at a disguised Little John, waving his stocky posterior, that's not usual Disney material. Even 'God' is uttered many times and a few political matters, notably when Little John questions the morality of their actions.Sex and politics have always been forbidden themes in Disney movies, but ""Robin Hood"" tackled them without hurting any sensitivity. The film is cleverly written and the dialogs' wits are highlighted by the voice-over, which is strength of the film, especially from Phil Harris who reprises his Baloo-role, and Peter Ustinov who's absolutely delightful as the royal Mama's boy, sucking his royal thumb with an irresistible baby moaning voice, or shouting ""Seize the fat one!"" during one of the film's zaniest and most exciting moments when the aftermath of an archery tournament turn into a football game parody.At the risk of repeating myself, that's the stuff that family movies are made of. I myself just turned into a father and I'm looking forward to make my daughter discover the film like I did with her grandpa, that's the magic of Disney classics, their appeal is both universal and timeless. And who can't resist to that little whistle tune that open the film and reflects the cheerful mood of the story, just the thought of it erase any piece of criticism.Not that the film is flawless, it's just that the flaws don't really affect it. It's fun, full of bright colors, hilarious, catchy and 40 years after, it's a classic. ""Beauty and the Beast"" might be superior, but I wonder how many Disney fans would choose it over ""Robin Hood"".",Robin Hood
26,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Oh, merry men!",7,10 July 2020,"'Robin Hood (1973)' is a solid animated adventure which transforms the titular folklore hero and his band of merry friends into anthropomorphic animals. It doesn't do anything particularly revolutionary or, even, all that noteworthy, but it does everything you'd expect it to and it does it all rather well. It's an entertaining time throughout, with its variety of set-pieces being both fun and exciting. There are some proper stakes, too, and the antics of our heroes often have tangible consequences. A real highlight of the thing is Peter Ustinov's performance as a feline 'momma's boy' version of Prince John, with his self-righteous bumbling and barely disguised insecurity making for a rather unique villain. The entire affair has a sort of storybook aesthetic to it that makes it incredibly easy to watch. It's enjoyable and well-conceived. 7/10",Robin Hood

However, even though this film is only 83 minutes long, the story feels a little watered down. This was the beginning of the Dark Age of Disney, after all.

30,tomgillespie2002,Often feels like an afterthought,5,31 July 2015,"Robin Hood rarely features on many people's favourite Disney movies, and there's a good reason why. Disney's original concept was an adaptation of Reynard the Fox, a collection of allegorical fables from Europe. The deceptive fox was seen as an amoral leading figure for their squeaky-clean and child-friendly output, so the plan was abolished in favour of adapting a more familiar folk-tale, Robin Hood and his Merry Men. This sudden change of plan causes Robin Hood to feel almost like an afterthought, written in such a hurry that the plot seems to shift around without focus, and characters feel like abandoned first draft's of the classic Disney heroes and villains.With King Richard away fighting his crusade, the kingdom is left in the hands of his thumb-sucking, mommy's-boy younger brother Prince John (Peter Ustinov). Our narrator Allan-a-Dale (Roger Miller) informs us that the poor are being bled dry by the astronomical taxes set by the Sheriff of Nottingham (Pat Buttram), and rely on the exploits of local hero Robin Hood (Brian Bedford) and his companion Little John (Phil Harris), who routinely steal from the rich to give to the poor. Robin enters into an archery tournament dressed as a stork in the hope of winning the heart of old flame Maid Marian (Monica Evans), under the watchful eye of Prince John and his hypnotic sidekick Sir Hiss (Terry-Thomas), who want Robin's head.Despite the mediocrity of the final film, Robin Hood is certainly bolstered by the impressive array of vocal talent. Bedford provides the charming twang of an English gent and Terry-Thomas is suitably and simultaneously reptilian and hilarious, but Peter Ustinov walks away with the film - his whiny rich-boy Prince John is one the greatest characters Disney have ever created. The presence of such quality British talent makes it strange that a lot of the cast sound like cowboys who have somehow wandered into a distinctly English setting. Some sequences are recycled directly from Disney classics such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and The Jungle Book (1967), and some characters are even borrowed and simply re-named. It's an up-and- down experience, where the plot occasionally wanders and lingers without any sense of narrative, but when Bedford, Thomas and Ustinov share a scene, that familiar Disney magic re-emerges.",Robin Hood

In fact, The things that goes on in this series' cartoons are in My opinion nuts which that is what makes them hilarious! There are so many to like and laugh at and the silly things they do!

32,zkonedog,"A Good Effort During The ""Down Years"" Of Disney",8,12 March 2017,"Sandwiched in between the death of Walt Disney, the visionary who established the entire Disney brand, and the company's partnership with Pixar that produced Toy Story, was a period of time in which Disney Co. was in limbo. This film came along smack dab during that period, but still managed to turn in a more than decent effort.The basic plot of Disney's Robin Hood closely follows the classic tale, where Robin (with the help of Little John and Friar Tuck) tries to save the poor citizens of Nottingham from a corrupt Sheriff and King, all the while striving for the hand of that beautiful Maid Marion. The fantastical twist, however, sees the characters being portrayed in an animal form that children will love. Robin is a crafty fox, Marion is his lovely vixen, King John is a cowardly lion, and the evil Sheriff is a menacing wolf, to name but a few.The plot of the film pretty much meanders around aimlessly, but is filled with enough action, hijinks, and subtle dashes of humor to keep your interest. In a nice addition, a slew of child-like characters add some heart to the movie, as well as give the kiddies some contemporaries to identify with (I did while watching the film as a youngster!).Perhaps the hallmark of the entire effort, though, is the fantastic music. The soothing, clear vocals of Roger Miller narrate portions of the film, as well as provide the signature songs. Other characters also lend their vocal talents to the soundtrack, and none fail.Thus, although Robin Hood isn't as ""classic"" as the early Disney collection or as ultimately engaging as the films of the Pixar era, children (and nostalgic adults) can still find plenty of things to enjoy about this movie. Plus, with Russell Crowe set to resurrect the Robin Hood franchise in a feature film this summer, now is the time to re-discover this hidden gem.",Robin Hood
33,filipemanuelneto,Something is missing here.,4,30 August 2018,"This film tells the traditional story of Robin Hood. However, it replaces humans with animals, in the best cartoon style and other Disney films like ""Lady and the Tramp"" or ""The Little Mermaid"" (where many characters are fish and sea creatures that speak). However, this film had the opposite destiny to these two examples: while they became well-liked classics, ""Robin Hood"" was eventually forgotten.Because? Well, the answer is clear to me: the film does not have the necessary quality. Kids will definitely like it because it's colorful and it's funny. But the film will not be able to please the adults, who will be deeply bored and think ""how is it possible that I, as a child, liked this?""The truth is that Disney has not always produced successes. I have been reviewed here some movies that the studio, if they could go back, would probably never have done or would have done in a radically different way. I'm remembering, for example, ""The Black Cauldron"", which was a failure and is considered by many (and in all fairness) to be one of the worst films Disney ever made.This movie is not totally bad. The characters play their role well, the voice actors do not deserve any negative criticism, the story is fairly true to the Robin Hood's story and there are some quality dialogues and scenes. The problem is that magic is missing. That spark is missing, that magical element we feel in other films. The songs are also here, and quite markedly, but most of them are so dumb that it deserves to end in oblivion.",Robin Hood

For this one, I wanted a summer vacations funny movie. The kid didn't like it (again too slow) so I watched it alone and have a really good time.England, medieval times are among my favorites interests. In addition, it's above all a comedy and without a lot of choregraphied songs! When I notice that it was released in 1973, I'am truly amazed. The movie is among my oldest I have seen and as nearly my age, I can tell it ages much better than me, ah, ah! In the DVD, you got also a Mickey cartoon from 1933, making me realized that the Disney company had a tremendous monopole over family entertainment: nearly 60 years (of wonder, like they said!).

37,Vartiainen,Fantastic medieval romp,7,3 August 2015,"Robin Hood is Disney's version of the classic English folktale, including multiple elements from different retellings, including King Richard being away on a Crusade, evil Prince John ruling the land with an iron fist, Maid Marian and many others. It's also one of the most successful films from the so called scratchy era of Disney when they were using the Xerox copy paste method to make their films with a smaller budget.Robin Hood succeeds because it's just so likable. The style, for one, is nicely medieval. Everything, from the opening titles to the characters to the style of music to the dialogue, hearkens back to the Dark Ages and as a whole it's one of the best medieval films Disney has ever done.Another great thing is the character cast. This is a film of many unforgettable characters, from Robin Hood himself to Little John, from the sheriff of Nottingham to Prince John, who's the perfect example of how to make a complete wimp of a villain that's still a legitimate threat, plus interesting to watch. The side characters are also excellent and as a whole they're so good that the story practically tells itself.The one problem and the reason why I didn't rate this higher, is the fact that this film is notorious for borrowing heavily from previous films. Various dance and action sequences were copy pasted directly from The Jungle Book and Snow White, among others. The character of Little John is basically just Baloo with a green shirt. Sir Hiss, Prince John's lackey, is simply just Kaa with a hat and a cape. It doesn't ruin the film, and you really can't tell if you haven't seen the films in question, but it does mean that it cannot be called a perfect film.Nevertheless, Robin Hood is a great deal of fun. It's filled with thrilling scenes, one after another, has a great character cast, some good songs and as a whole it's simply entertaining.",Robin Hood

Of course, a scant four years later, Star Wars was to usurp it as my very favorite, but it remained a close second for many years to come.I'm not entirely sure, but I think this is the only Disney animation to have all the characters portrayed by animals alone.

39,drqshadow-reviews,"A Charming, Light-Hearted, Young Boy's Fantasy",7,31 March 2020,"Dashing outlaws and dastardly lawmen collide once again in Disney's appropriately scrappy, talking animal production of a well-worn literary tale. Smartly cast as a thrifty, roguish fox, Robin Hood is the charismatic engine that drives the whole affair. Whether athletically embarrassing palace guards in public, lifting a stash of the king's gold on the sly or winking at gobsmacked kids to share a taste of the day's thrills, he's a mesmerizing character. Dare I say, the animated version is right in-line with Errol Flynn's timeless, entrancing live-action take from thirty-odd years prior. One glance at Robin's optimistic vigor and never-say-die attitude and it's tough to look elsewhere.After a few lean years, Disney's animation department seems to have turned a corner with Robin Hood. They still take some artistic shortcuts - this film's become notorious for its use of repurposed shots from prior features, plus its copy-and-paste stock animations - but the workmanship is top-notch, bursting with life and detail and smooth, extravagant flourishes in motion. There's an energy to this picture, both in action and appearance, that smooths over most of the rough edges. It's not top-shelf material - neither as ambitious, nor as miraculous as the daunting epics of the studio's past - but few are. As innocent, inoffensive, swashbuckling adventures go, one could do a whole lot worse.",Robin Hood

I don't worship at the church of the mouse or get all weepy over it's iconography. So I'm judging its early 70s take on 'Robin Hood' strictly on merit, and sadly it barely gets a passing grade.Considered one of Disney's weaker animated efforts by even the most ardent of fans, 'Robin Hood' ambles along pleasantly enough, but it never displays any sense of purpose and ultimately never builds any momentum. The humor lacks wit and often falls flat despite the best efforts of a solid voice cast. Only their talent and the animation--which looks up to the usual Disney standards despite it's reduced budget and some cost cutting recycling--manage to rise above.Disney's 'Robin Hood' has it's charms, but they're likely to be lost on the young, and grownups are likely to be too bored to even notice them.",Robin Hood

I always enjoy Phil Harris, even if him as Little John here is practically Baloo ('The Jungle Book') 2.0. Roger Miller is delightful as Alan-a-Dale, while Peter Ustinov is good as Prince John.The plot is OK, just not massively entertaining or interesting in my opinion, while animation-wise it's fine.

(How the uninspired ""Love"" got an Academy Award nomination is beyond me.) Then there's the animation, which is among the crudest Disney ever produced for a feature. It also constantly reuses animation for earlier, better Disney films, from the groundbreaking Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) to the then recent Jungle Book (1967).About the only interesting elements are the villains, Prince John and Sir Hiss, whose old married couple style bickering proves entertaining.Stick to the Errol Flynn Robin Hood, which is beautifully shot and will have you feeling like a kid again.

The films produced during this 22 year period continue to receive rather mixed reception from animation afficionados, though those who grew up with them tend to remember them more fondly. The 1973 ROBIN HOOD might be the most popular of these dark age Disney pictures: aside from the furries who love it for obvious reasons, plenty of folks born between the 1970s and 1990s are just crazy about this ROBIN HOOD.I was born in the early 1990s and didn't see ROBIN HOOD in full until I was in my 20s, but I have to say, the film is charming in a lowkey way. The characters are likable and the comic episodes are entertaining. It's unashamedly a children's movie, but it isn't insulting about that.

The characters are just effortless to love, it's nearly impossible not to fall in love with them. Many are amusing and will make you laugh, then they'll tug at your heart just like only Disney can do. There's great friendship and romance shared between characters in the movie.

I think, though, that it demonstrates two things: that ""Robin Hood"" was made under the same cost cutting Disney regime that made ""The Aristocats"" three years earlier and ""The Rescuers"" three years later; and that it has far more life than both of these films put together.It IS the cost-cutting that would damn this film, and it's liveliness that redeems it.  (That, and Peter Ustinov's vocal performance as Prince John.) I can't even find it in my heart to condemn the Southern voices scattered throughout Sherwood Forest and Nottingham - replacing a human sheriff with a lupine one is such a violent change that the use of expressions like, ""Aw, geez, Nutsy,"" seems trivial by comparison.  At any rate I found the voices far less irritating than Kevin Costner's drawl in HIS version of Robin Hood.The animation is mostly good but without the stand-out brilliance of, say, ""The Jungle Book"".  There are a few scenes that look as if they belong on television (which is a problem shared with the next five animated features that Disney made).

The scenes with Prince John and Sir Hiss are easily the funniest in the movie, and create a memorable villain. Unfortunately where the movie falls short is in its animation and technical aspects. The character models are imaginative and well designed, but there's noticeable instances where the filmmakers are recycling animation from other projects including Sword in the Stone and Jungle Book. The recycling is usually well hidden, but it often causes distraction in some of the more elaborate sequences of the movie.

51,classicalsteve,Generally Enjoyable Disney Animated Feature with An Disappointing Music Soundtrack,7,17 March 2017,"The legend of Robin Hood's exploits may have occurred in the 13th century (i.e. 1200's) and the earliest known written account is from the 14th century via ""Piers Ploughman"" by William Langland. So essentially it is a very medieval story/legend. Disney's animated take on the legend is a fairly enjoyable family experience. It does have one glaring shortcoming which I'll relate later in my review.In typical Disney fashion, the characters are all anthropomorphized animals, i.e. animals which are human-like. Robin Hood is a fox, Little John is a bear, Friar Tuck is a badger, Maid Marion is a vixen, King John is a lion, etc. The story is told by Alan-a-Dale a rooster-minstrel play by Phil Harris. The characters are generally true to those of the original legend, and to give it credit. The friendship between Robin and Little John is legendary and of course the love affair between him and Maid Marion. Friar Tuck provides the voice of morality to the story, very similar to Friar Laurence of ""Romeo and Juliet"". And it does include the famous archery contest which is missing in many screen renditions of the story. Although most kids have heard of Robin Hood, American kids generally don't know when the Middle Ages occurred let alone it's cultural heritage. When I saw this film, I knew of Robin Hood but I don't believe I quite understand that the story was supposed to take place in the 1200's.While I can buy into the anthropomorphized take on the characters, ""Disney's Robin Hood"" is weak in one glaring respect. The filmmakers opted for songs by American songwriters, particularly Phil Harris and Roger Miller, known for country-western pop tunes such as ""King of the Road"". When I saw this Disney's offering of the medieval legend as a kid, I didn't know anything about medieval secular music. Not until I was in college I found out there are quite a number of secular tunes which survive from the late Middle Ages. I think Disney missed out on a golden opportunity to use medieval music rather than late 20th century country-style tunes. Phil Harris tells the story in a gruff American country voice with an acoustic guitar. The guitar wouldn't be invented for another 500 years from around the time of the events. In other words, medieval minstrels wouldn't use guitars. So sadly, the music style fails to bring us into the 13th century. (Roger Miller would a decade later write the score for a Broadway production of ""Huckleberry Finn"" called ""Big River"" which was a much more appropriate use of his talents. He would win awards for the music.) Still, all things considered, Disney's ""Robin Hood"" stays truer to the story than many other offerings. The later ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" is not as well written as the Disney animated film, in particular they cut out the archery contest. The best in recent years is probably ""Robin Hood"" starring Russell Crowe and directed by Ridley Scott. However, even that offering is only about half the story as he doesn't become ""Robin Hood"" until the very end.",Robin Hood

53,Stampsfightclub,Disney classic preaches and entertains,10,7 January 2009,"Robin Hood and Little John fight the forces of the Sheriff of Nottingham and Prince John and help feed the poor.Walt Disney is quite possibly the greatest story teller of all time. Not only do his animated pictures excite and entertain us, they all have an encoded message that preaches towards its family audience. From the being in the right place Jungle Book to the circle of life in the Lion King Walt has become legendary.This 1973 animation has an equally impressive story and message as his previous releases with a memorable score and riveting narrative.Retelling the infamous story of outlaw Robin Hood and his adventures in Sherwood Forest, this adaptation isn't afraid to go political for its message. We see a strong issue driven narrative that sees the greedy Prince John take from the poor to feed his wealthy life and the torments that the poor residents go through is almost tear worthy.Although being very political and issue driven, the film is not without entertainment and fun value.Seeing Robin Hood dress up in humorous disguises such as a gypsy, a stalk and a vulture will have the kids engaged to the narrative. The fact that the characters are all animals makes the film easy to view and appreciate without taking away the importance of its preaching politics.The humour is a fantastic advice to portray the personalities of the characters such as Prince John's baby sequences and Lady Kluck's ambitious and forceful antics, watch out for the football parody, one scene which never fails to steal the moment.Being Disney and an animation, this is a great introduction into the life of the poor and rich which children should really appreciate.Simple and with enough information to contain this is a gateway to a better understanding of grown up issues for the younger viewer.The animation is as usual top notch from Disney but story aside the element which steals the limelight is the beautifully written score.Combining so well with what is happening on screen; Robin Hood finds the right mood at the right time to make it believable and equally enjoyable.Not as strong as Jungle Book or Lion King per say but there is nothing to be faulted.",Robin Hood

I just think it has everything to be good entertainment for all. It is a shame that it is rarely spoken of. I find it SO much better than the cutesy and lazy Aristocats which is really overrated. Prince John and Sir Hiss are hilarious villains throughout the movie. Basically a spoiled brat who cries loudly when things don't go his way. It is hard to make such a person credible, but Peter Ustinov does a great job. And he also sucks his thumb, genius! Actually, the Sheriff of Nottingham is a far more cruel villain in the movie.Robin Hood also has these great changes in atmosphere. From whimsical and colourful to dark and melancholic. And the soundtrack is amazing! I don't care what others say, the songs are gorgeous. When the soft and sincere ""Love"" plays I cry every time, it is so romantic. You really feel the romance. And ""Not In Nottingham"" sets the perfect mood when all citizens in Nottingham seem to have lost all hope. It also has some of the best suspense from a Disney movie and a good climax.

It is difficult to choose which are my favorite Robin Hood films. But I would say I love Disney's version and ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" starring Errol Flynn.You know something, Walt Disney's Robin Hood is perhaps the most famous animated version of the legend, which had the various characters depicted as anthropomorphic animal characters, including Robin Hood and Maid Marian as foxes; I love foxes. You know, this was probably the very first time that any studio would use anthropomorphic animal characters in an animated feature. I also love three out the songs from the film's soundtrack:
""Oo-de-lally,""
""Love,"" and...
""The Phony King of England."" Overall, as I said I love this film and it's another Disney favorite; my dad's favorite too.",Robin Hood
58,mitsubishizero,"Great, underrated movie!",10,18 November 2018,"I used to watch this as a kid and it's my favorite Disney movie. While it may not be the greatest movie made by Disney as it was made during their dark age, I still think it's enjoyable. I like the characters, the animation, action and the story. It's strange how half of the characters have american accents and the other half have english accents but I don't know I think it blends well. The story's been told several times but what makes this different is how the characters are anthropomorphic animals.For those who don't know it's about Robin Hood (a red fox voiced by Brian Bedford) robbing from the rich to give to the poor. His target in particular is the greedy, cowardly yet conniving Prince John (a lion voiced by the late Peter Ustinov) who took over after his brother's absence. Helping him on his exploits are his jovial, smooth talking partner Little John (a bear voiced by Phil Harris), Friar Tuck (a badger voiced by Andy Devine) and later on his love interest Maid Marian (also a fox voiced by Monica Evans) and her friend Lady Cluck (a chicken voiced by Carole Shelley).In addition to Prince John he also has to deal with his minions Sir Hiss (obviously a snake voiced by Terry Thomas), The Sheriff (a wolf voiced by Pat Buttram who also voiced Chief from The Fox and the Hound), and his flunkies that are two dimwitted vultures named Nutsy and Trigger (voiced by George Lindsay and Ken Curtis). Hilarity ensures when Robin steps up to challenge John's leadership. Probably the best example's when John shows his craftiness by setting up a trap for Robin Hood in the form of an archery contest in which he and Little John disguise themselves in order to enter though after their ruse is discovered hi jinks ensure. The action and choreography in this scene's great. It can get chaotic but you still follow it. The payoff at the end is funny because Lady Cluck ends up stealing the show by taking on a bunch of soldiers in the style of a football game.The characters are likable in some way or form. Their chemistry is enjoyable and even the villains are those love to hate kind. Prince John and Sir Hiss are laughable in their chemistry. The action's great. How it's paced is smooth and natural. In fact the final confrontation has a huge, intense payoff and in the end it wraps up pretty well. I think it's a good movie. I think the only nitpicks I have are the fact that they recycle animation from previous movies. It doesn't bother me that much but it does come as lazy though I guess I can forgive it being that it was made during a rough time. Speaking of rough, the same can be said about the animation. The backgrounds are nice but the characters have a mostly scruffy look. It's not distracting but it's very noticeable. Another thing I noticed is where was Maid Marian for most of the movie? Wouldn't it have been cool if they showed more of Robin and Marian's relationship as well as why they briefly split?Aside from that it's an underrated classic. Take it for what it's worth and see for yourself.",Robin Hood

60,Atreyu_II,A very charming movie,8,10 July 2007,"The 21st animated Disney classic is one of the funniest classics by Disney.This movie always amused me. I've always loved it my entire life and I will always enjoy it.""Robin Hood"" isn't among the most underrated Disney classics but, just like any other Disney classic, it is underrated as well.""Robin Hood"" might not be one of the most technically perfect Disney classics but it is very enjoyable and charming.Some people complain about this movie because of its simple picture quality and stuff like that, as if it was terrible. But is it Disney at its worst? Absolutely not! Fortunately this movie is very well accepted in general. Many people love it (including me) and few people seem to dislike it.This great movie has classic humor, British humor, enchantment, charm, romance, drama, nice songs, funny villains and even some depressing moments. But most of the time this movie is deliciously hilarious.For example, the entire sequence of the Archery Tournament's destruction is unbelievably hilarious and hysterical. The whole part of the song ""The Phony King of England"" is also hilarious, which continues with the Sheriff and Hiss singing it.These are just some of the most hilarious moments. I could go on, but it would take forever to mention all of them.The songs are all very nice: ""The Phony King of England"", ""Love"", ""Not in Nottingham"", ""Robin Hood"" and even the whistle song at the opening credits.About the characters, they're very pleasant in general. Robin Hood is a clever fox, charming and a big joker. Little John is simple as a bear should be and has also a great sense of humor. Friar Tuck is funny and kind hearted. Lady Kluck is hilarious. Maid Marian is a charming female character. Alan-A-Dale is a great minstrel. The bunnies are cool characters.The villains are funny in general. Prince John is funny but also heartless, very evil, greedy, ambitious, explosive, a traitor, a tyrant and a cowardly ""crybaby"". The Sheriff of Nottingham, sometimes referred to as ""Bushel Britches"", isn't as mean as Prince John, but he's just as heartless and greedy as P.J.Hiss is a comic relief. He's a hilarious snake, used and abused by Prince John. Hiss isn't really evil or dangerous, he's more kind of ""I want to be evil but I just can't"". In that subject he's very much like Mr. Snoops from ""The Rescuers"".""Robin Hood"" has also the precious help of legendary actors to voice the characters: Phil Harris, Terry-Thomas, Peter Ustinov, Andy Devine, John Fiedler, Brian Bedford, Roger Miller, Pat Buttram, J. Pat O'Malley and Barbara Luddy.This should definitely be on Top 250.",Robin Hood
61,johnstonjames,This Is Soooo Richard Scarry,8,26 February 2011,"man. was this film intended to be so much like Richard Scarry? if it wasn't, then the resemblance to the works of Richard Scarry is extraordinarily similar. this really does seem like Disney adapting Richard Scarry.that's just fine with me. i love Disney and i have a lot of respect for Richard Scarry's anthropomorphic creations. Richard Scarry delighted me as a child and still does, although i find the books to be aimed at very small children so i don't read em anymore. but i still dig Disney as an adult so i find this combination of Scarry and Disney to be a delightful blast of fun.'Robin Hood' is also one of Disney's best cartoon features for the toddler set. most all of Disney's cartoon features aim at acceptance from an older more mature audience, 'Robin Hood' doesn't seem particularly concerned with adult appeal. that's just fine and that's also what i like best about it. it requires less involved thought then the other Disney films and has far less ambitious and lofty pretensions. not every work of fun or entertainment has to be ""high culture"" or serious ""art"". this is one of Disney's most ""laid back"" films animated or live action, and definitely one of Disney's least pretentious. which is saying a lot because on a whole, Disney is not very pretentious. Disney is a art form that is made to appeal to middle America and it's traditional values.i was really surprised and appalled to read that some people actually thought the detailed, full animation in this was terrible or shoddy. even some viewers liked the film but thought the animation was bad. so much for pearls before idiots. this is not a matter of opinion. if you think this is poorly animated you know nothing about the art of hand drawn animation. not only was a lot of time, care and money lavished on this feature, there is so much nuance and detail to the animation, especially in the prison escape sequence toward the end. if you can't identify or see the detail then you are obviously in too much of a hurry and not paying attention or using your brain. saying the animation here is poor is just plain stupid and unfair. use your eyes and brains folks.Disney's 'Robin Hood' doesn't even warrant or elicit that kind of judgmental criticism in the first place. it's not exactly a film that is mired in self importance. Disney's 'Robin Hood' cartoon is a very easy going experience and should be taken as such. it doesn't have that kind of ambition or reaches that far as to be taken too seriously. and the wonderful hand drawn animation reflects it's simplicity as entertainment. anyone too critical is trying to make too much out of this and perceive this as something it's not. if you try to make too much out of this charming little film you've gone over the deep end and you need to get a real life.Disney's cartoon feature of 'Robin Hood' is a cute and charming little film with terrific animation and character vocals by some fine and engaging actors. it also boast some catchy and memorable music by Roger Miller. the whole film is a total delight from beginning to end and very Disneyish.i feel sorry for the people who were too overly critical of the animation and this film. how can you be critical of something as simplistic as this? being too critical or having a problem with this film is, well, sort of 'Scarry'.",Robin Hood

I am not sure what I would think of this film now, through an adult's eyes, but I absolutely loved it. No, this animation cannot be compared to some of Disney's other films, but this does nothing to hurt the film. It is still a fun film and worth a watch.

63,Igenlode Wordsmith,Robin Hood goes American -- with surprising success,7,3 March 2007,"This is Robin Hood given the good old American folksy treatment to help it go down with Disney's domestic market: the characters adventure around the 'village' of 'Notting-Ham', the cutesy bunnies worship 'Robbinood' and the Sheriff has a 'posse': doubtless the only sort of Sheriff those Saturday-morning audiences had ever encountered... But the amazing thing is that really, it does get away with it. Half the characters may be upper-class and the other half hoarse-voiced American gangsters, the songs may be lacklustre (weirdly enough, I heard this first in a dubbed Scandinavian version on board a ship going up the Baltic -- it's a long story to explain -- where the singing seemed much better), but the story of Robin Hood is pretty robust, and it can survive almost anything save being taken excessively seriously. Robin Hood is the trickster of English folklore, a wicked merry rogue, and the worst thing you can do to him is submerge him in meaningful gloom; no danger of that here.For what could be more impudent and wily than a clever red fox? Half the humour of the film consists of watching the archetypal characters matched to appropriate animals: the ponderous spearmen as rhinoceroses, the trumpeters as elephants, burly Little John as a bear, Prince John as a mangy royal lion, Marian's nurse as a plump and flustered hen (with a lone and inexplicable Scottish accent...). I confess I could do without the obligatory Disney child-characters (""Aw, they're kiiiissing!""), but at least they don't have any significant role to play in saving the day -- that would be just too nauseating. The little church-mouse-deacon and his wife, on the other hand, are a nice touch.Given its general child-friendly remit, the film does a pretty good job of painting its villains in a convincing bad light, showing them stealing a child's birthday present, squeezing taxes from a cripple by jarring his broken leg (with the infamous tax slogan 'if it isn't hurting, it isn't working!'), and emptying the poor-box. From the very first scene, we are reminded that things are getting more dangerous for Robin and his band: even Robin has to admit that the Sheriff's men are getting better. And while Prince John is an ineffective villain, his intentions are gratifyingly ruthless: none of those infuriating scenes where the Evil Overlord dithers around giving the hero a chance to escape. Earlier ""Robin Hood"" pictures are referenced in the sequence where Robin is trapped just the wrong side of a portcullis as his companions escape; but there is no effortless swarm to the top and over the gates here. In one of the genuinely nail-biting pieces of action, our quicksilver fox ends up cornered in a burning tower, climbing ever upwards as the flames rise, and rapidly running out of options...The film has its flaws, although I'm not sure the lack of an overarching plot is one of them: the Robin Hood legends and ballads never really had one, being a long list of apocryphal exploits strung together. The ending is a definite cop-out, though, jumping directly to the happy-ever-after epilogue without any intervening action at all -- it's as if someone just got bored of writing and decided to stop dead. What it does have in abundance, and what some of its live-action rivals disastrously lack, is a saving sense of mischief.",Robin Hood

It just so happens that most of the riches come from the greedy paws of Prince John (a lion). He constantly has his henchman, the Sheriff of Nottingham (a wolf), collect taxes from the poor animals of Sherwood Forest to line his own pockets. Even though Robin is wanted by Prince John and the Sheriff of Nottingham, he risks his life to enter an archery contest and win the hand of Maid Marion (a vixen).This classic has everything we've come to expect from a Disney movie. Basically, it's filled with talking animals in the roles of characters dancing and singing merrily. I'm not a huge fan of musicals, but the story in between more than makes up for the moments I sit waiting for the crooning to end.Much like ""The Aristocats"" was a product of its jazz and big-band cultural surroundings in 1970, ""Robin Hood"" features a soundtrack influenced by the folk artists of that same period. It fits the atmosphere of the movie perfectly. There's no doubt children and fans of Gordon Lightfoot, Peter, Paul and Mary, and other singer-songwriters will be delighted.",Robin Hood

It's a very exciting story which the folks at Disney made into an animated film; for instance, we have a fox taking the role here.What I like about this film: It's terrific. Disney does an excellent job with the old films; quality animation, many being based on fairy tales that were read to us as little children, and nothing but 100% family fun!!!!!These thoughts have made me have a go at this movie!

Don't you ever wonder what the fascist, communist-hating Mr. Disney would have thought about bringing such an inherently socialist tale to the silver screen under his life's work's label? I know I do. Robin Hood quite explicitly makes the rich and royal people of England out to be total crooks, and the poor workers out to be heroes in a Marxist fashion. ""Stealing from the rich and giving to the needy."" Indeed. The adventurous Sherwood Forest hero Robin Hood who did so was my very first crush. Luckily, I have since then outgrown my infatuation for animals. Although I can look back and see that he still is quite the fox.I maintain there are subtle elements of English humour that shine through in Disney's Robin Hood, and maybe that is why I like it so much. It may also be the hysterical comedic sidekicks like Sir Hiss. Whatever it is, this is without a doubt the best story of Robin Hood told on film, even though it's a cartoon aimed for kids. Good songs, good fast-paced action (that archery contest at the medieval fair was genius), interesting characters and nicely animated sets. All the characters have been translated into appropriate and symbolic animals. If you haven't thought about that before, do it next time you watch this film.Maid Marion is perhaps one of the weakest female Disney characters, but then, they have never been known to be very dimensional or showed much range other than when they are the protagonists (like Ariel), and Marion is not oneshe is a supporting character to the awesome Robin Hood and that is enough for this film.Robin Hood is Disney film that's stuck with me through the years and its only rival for best Disney film of all time is perhaps Aladdin.",Robin Hood

She has no other character trait other than to be in love with the protagonist - a woeful trend in the main female characters in the early films of Disney.Robin and Marian's relationship is so bland. They claim to know each other since they were children, but since they haven't met since they were at a young age, there's no reason for them to be so in love.

The one character that's new to the Disney version was Sir Hiss, a snake voiced by Terry-Thomas.I remember seeing this movie when I was 12 and really liked it. One thing I remember is that Alan-a-Dale was a rooster and voiced by Roger Miller, who wrote and sung three of the movie's songs. Miller was part of an outstanding voice cast besides Thomas that included Brian Bedford, Phil Harris, Peter Ustinov, Pat Buttram, and two actresses who played the Pigeon Sisters on The Odd Couple, Monica Evans and Carole Shelley.If you haven't seen the Disney version of Robin Hood, rent it.

80,Vimacone,Disney Animation Lives On,7,15 February 2015,"Many people of my generation (those who grew up in the late 80s and early 90s) light up with enthusiasm whenever Robin Hood is mentioned in a conversation about Disney films. Yet Robin Hood isn't generally regarded as one of the greats. It is a film I enjoy very much, but it has it's ups and downs with me. Robin Hood was the first Disney feature to go into production after Walt Disney's death. This was a time when the future of Disney animation was still very much in doubt, since many didn't think that the studio could go on without Walt. With Robin Hood the studio went back to its roots to the days of the Silly Symphonies. They decided to use all anthromorphic animals for the roles and type cast by animal. That for me was the appeal to the film. Prince John is one of my favorite villains. He's a lot like Captain Hook in that he's very immature and is constantly undermined. The Sheriff of Nottingham is one of the funnier yet most detestable villains. I like how they portray the love between Robin Hood and Maid Marian. The film also has egregious reuse of animation from previous films, but this was because the studio was in survival mode. The second half of the film wasn't as engaging as the first half. Maid Marian disappears until the end. The climax would have been stronger if they showed her in some sort of peril where Robin Hood would rescue her. The film probably had great appeal to children because there aren't any scary scenes like in the earlier films. While not as strong as the Disney films of the 60s, Robin Hood proved that Disney animation could go on without Walt.",Robin Hood

It was still enjoyable and still better than most of the movies out there. I really like the music especially when they used the staccato to give the viewer a sense of urgency. I was told right before I watched it by my friends I watched it with that this movie was made when Disney was in a lot of financial problems and I think that actually saved the movie, because without knowing that I would have just thought they were ripping off a lot of characters and voices, but it seems to be a little more forgivable given the financial situation. I really like having the rooster being a folk singer and it helped infuse a different feel to a story of this type. Since it was mostly a fairy tale the fold singer really melded the different genres together. In all honestly the best parts were the really quite little animals. They were supposed to be sappy were a cheap way of getting the viewer to feel bad for the situation and it worked extremely well. I actually enjoyed the animals and how ridiculous it was to have all of them in the same universe and playing off each extremely well. It is not my favorite Disney film, but it is still a Disney film, which makes it a lot of fun.",Robin Hood

Also, let's not forget that it was made in 1973; so don't get in my face about the animation... that's just how things were.For all you naysayers, I say this: take this one for a spin if you love classic Disney.10/10",Robin Hood

I absolutely loved the rabbit family and the other children. Overall the movie has impeccable voice talent, I'm a little biased because every moment of the movie brought me rushing back to childhood.This is such a wonderful animated movie from the days of yesteryear and to be honest I would love to see this movie re-done in today's graphics for the children of today.

87,datautisticgamer-74853,Worse than I remembered,5,6 August 2019,"In my initial review of this movie, I was quite generous with some of my criticism of it, and since my brother and I watched it again yesterday through the 40th Anniversary Blu-Ray, I want to elaborate more on why I believe this movie is overrated.The story is full of conveniences and is overall just strange for a Disney movie, and not the surreal strange like Dumbo or Pinocchio. It feels very much like Disney was really improvising the plot as they went through and didn't take time to explain things like why Toby is suddenly with the rabbit children when Skippy shoots his first arrow, how Allan-a-Dale connects to the rest of the Merry Men, how the vixen Maid Marian is related by blood to lions Prince John and King Richard, et cetera. In fact, you can actually sum up Robin Hood's plot as ""That Happens: The Movie"". The Phony King of England comes right out of nowhere after Love (strange it got an Academy Award nomination, because it's not really special other than to give Maid Marian another voice). Its pacing is inconsistent, and despite being set around 1194 (King Richard returned to England that year), it features badminton, balloons, and references to football (complete with the background music for the beautiful brawl being a rendition of On Wisconsin). Not to mention, despite being set in Central England, many of the characters give a feel that it would be set in the American South. The music has more of a country than medieval European feel to it, plus Trigger's crossbows are used to make rifle references. There was even one point where ""Devonshire"" was mispronounced (as ""Devon shai-ur"" rather than ""Devon-shur"" in proper English). Lastly, it has probably the most anti-climactic ending in any Disney movie I can remember. We had established that Robin Hood was a trickster, so of course it wouldn't be unexpected that he would feign his own death. Then we run into the cliché of ""evil master gets p*ssed at his henchman"", and then we cut immediately to Robin and Marian's wedding without developing King Richard or Marian any more.Because of the anachronisms and the fact they are convinced they are telling the REAL story of Robin Hood, I am personally convinced Disney instead gave us the depiction of a group of 1973 furries who decided to parody the story of Robin Hood. I could at least respect it more that way, but until Disney confirms such (not that they would), the plot is definitely an indicator that since Walt's passing 7 years before the company had lost their way.Another big indication that Disney was pulling no punches with being cheap is the animation. Conceptually, Don Bluth managed to bring out a great looking Robin Hood and Skippy, and some other characters do present a bit of creativity with their species (like Lady Kluck). On the other hand you have discount Baloo as Little John (both voiced by Phil Harris and having multicolored flashing eyes in their respective movies' menagerie musical numbers), discount Kaa as Sir Hiss (with identical hypnosis and contortion to match), and mice from The Aristocats. Speaking of which, Robin Hood stole a lot of its animation from earlier movies; for The Phony King of England; Maid Marian's shaking is copied from Duchess' in The Aristocats, and her clapping is Snow White's. Little John's dance with Lady Kluck in the same number is taken from Baloo's dance with King Louie in The Jungle Book. The drumming rabbit is copied from The Aristocats' ""Everybody Wants to Be a Cat"". Finally, during the ""beautiful brawl"", there is a maze lanes portion that rips off Alice in Wonderland. Of course, it does use plenty of its own animation later on, most notably for the Sheriff. The lighting messes up at times by making some characters' bodies look the same color (i.e. in the start of ""Love"", Robin's body starts out completely orange before his neck corrects itself to white). I don't know if I can blame Disney back in 1973 because they were becoming as poor as the Nottinghamians when John raised the taxes, but I was just resentful at how many corners they decided to cut here (they even used a live-action bell for Friar Tuck's church; it was added post-production). As the Sheriff would put it, ""There's somethin' funny goin' on around here.""There is (as I had mentioned in my previous review) an alternate ending that, if they actually used, almost salvages this movie. It trades the lack of climax for a more manageable deus ex machina appearance by King Richard, and the way its heavy heart was written in (at least as shown in Most Wanted and 40th Anniversary) actually contrasts pretty nicely with the tone of the rest of the film. With a bit more polish on its script, it would have at least had the movie finish on a more satisfying note.There are things that I will say this film does right; while the music doesn't always feel in place it's not really horrible, and it does distract a little bit from the two-bit animation it often comes with. The settings do feel appropriate for 1194 Central England, the voice acting is spot on in spite of not enough British voices, and there are occasional and intentional chuckle inducers. It still has Disney color and charm that helps it contribute somewhat to the magic, and because of this, I will say that most children will have a blast with this film. They can appreciate having a relatable character in Skippy, the fair idol of Robin Hood, the beauty of Maid Marian, and a pretty fun villain duo of Prince John and Sir Hiss. The relationship between Robin and Marian, as well as some of the writing, could potentially captivate some adults to like this movie too, if my account icon says anything about that...So overall, is Robin Hood a bad animated movie in general? No. Is it a bad Disney movie? Yes. The sad thing is, Disney probably couldn't foresee that merely 13 years later, they were on the verge of closing Walt Disney Animation Studios for good. While The Black Cauldron would prove be their near-poison, in an alternate universe where they did fold this would not be a good film to have near the end of their résumé. It's good to watch with the kids, but don't feel overly surprised if you feel underwhelmed after watching it.",Robin Hood
88,Mulliga,The best telling of Robin Hood on the silver screen,10,7 April 2002,"It is strange how many people damn the Disney version of ""Robin Hood"" for rough and repetitious animation, one-dimensional characters, and weak pacing. After all, A LOT of animated films suffer from this syndrome, even ""landmark"" productions like ""Anastasia"" and ""Shrek."" The characters are stereotypes, but they act believably: Prince John is silly, but with a truly evil undercurrent (""Squeeze every last drop out of those insolent...musical...peasants.""), the Sheriff is deliciously nasty (""Upsy-daisy""), and Robin Hood is very affable. The music is, quite simply, fantastic. ""Not in Nottingham"" is easily the best Disney song ever (barring ""When She Loved Me"" in Toy Story 2), the opening theme and song are catchy and appropriate for the movie's tone, and the movie's action scenes are clever, chaotic, and action-packed but not gory.

I watched it again today, if only to revive old memories.Somehow, it's not as good as I remember.  Perhaps I was drawn to the bright colors and the funny characters.  Whatever it was, it seemed to be missing today.But still, it's a nice tale of semi-good versus good.  Robin Hood is now characterized as a charming young Fox.  Little John is a bear (who seems much like Baloo) and Friar Tuck is... uh... a Friar.  Not too sure what he is.  Maybe a mole.Anyway, it's a funny movie with some nice songs and good action.  It probably has one of the best villains in Disney history.  Come on, how many times do you see a guy scream, ""Kill him!"" in a Disney movie?  Not that often.  King Richard and Sir Hiss will have you laughing throughout the movie.However, there are only two climactic moments in the movie, and this makes it out to be just a little tedious.  That doesn't deter from the nature of the film, though, and it's an exciting romp nonetheless.  Although it's more for the children, I'm sure it can appeal to viewers of many ages.",Robin Hood

This movie was the first Disney flick without the involvement of Walt Disney the man himself and, despite people thought it would be a flop, was a huge hit and the most popular Disney feature at it's time. It was also all the more a hit when it was re-released in the '80's. Another person said it was the best pre ""Little Mermaid"" film.

I personally just love Prince John and how he acts tough and clever yet put him in peril and he runs away like a coward. His sidekick Sir Hiss is even smarter than he is and yet they both seem to be the perfect villain and apprentice. The Sheriff of Nottingham was probably not as likable but he also fits the perfect villain as well.Robin Hood also doesn't run too long and should be a hit with parents who don't want to sit around and be bored.

It's, in my opinion, one of the most memorable Disney films of all time.It's a little different than most versions of Robin Hood but I think it had to be since it's Disney. The main story is still there and it's great, although I think the main reason its child friendly and liked is because all the characters are animals. Unlike Oliver and Company where the story of Oliver Twist is changed to be about cats, Robin Hood is played by animals and could have been people, which I think makes it less appealing in some aspects.The fox Robin Hood was one of my favorite characters growing up. I also still think that Prince John and Sir Hiss are hilarious. One of my other favorite parts of the film is the narrating and soundtrack of Roger Miller. It is definitely a cartoon you watch for the story more than the comedy, like Snow White or Cinderella.The film however does move a little slow at times. I think most cartoons now are much more active and funny than they used to so I feel some kids now days won't be as into it as kids were in the 70s and 80s.

101,joliefille411,The Broken Clock is Right Twice a Day,7,7 February 2010,"Here we have the second film in what I consider the ""bleak years"" of the Disney canon that while doing everything I abhor in animation, still manages to make me like it all the more. I cannot bring myself to love it, but actually liking a film from this period says a whole lot.I am a Robin Hood junkie. I have watched nearly every adaption available and it does take more than turning my hero into a fox (very sly- bravo Disney!) to deter me from this ageless story. More specifically, it takes Kevin Costner. I can't say this really improves upon the story to make everyone talking animals, but at least it doesn't make everything thoroughly unpleasant. In fact nothing really can kill it: the anachronistic folk-country music, dodgy American casting, the stupid XEROX outlines (yes, even I am getting tired of harping on it), the massive loads of recycled animation not only from within the film but icons of previous films, or the overall laziness this film was apparently treated with based on the assumption that when you market to kids, quality no longer matters. Do you know no shame, post-Walt production team???And it probably comes down to personal opinion, but mashed all together this stuff just works. Peter Ustinov and Terry-Thomas as Prince John and Hiss make the lamest of Disney villains into some of the most watchable- rather than fearing them, you just want them to go on to see what will come next. I also admittedly enjoyed Brian Bedford as Robin and though the casting of jazzy American Phil Harris as Balo- errr, I mean Little John should be bothersome- who can really help but adore Phil Harris?The music is hopelessly out of tune with the setting of the movie, and even with itself from song to song- how in the world does Love end up right next to The Phony King of England?- but blast my ears if I don't love it anyways.So even after telling myself there is no possible reason to or way I could like this Robin Hood, I do. It throws all the conventions of how to make a proper animated feature out the window and then proceeds to spit on them. Yet all this roguish thumbing of the nose only further endears this outlawed film to my heart.Quote of the Film:Taxes! Taxes! Beautiful, lovely taxes! Ah-hah! Ah-hah!",Robin Hood
102,Foux_du_Fafa,"A charming little gem, if far from perfect",7,28 August 2013,"""Robin Hood"" was made at a strange transit point in animation history, long after the Golden Age of Cartoons yet still some time before the renewed interest in animation brought about by Disney, Pixar and others. Moreover, it was one of the first animated features made in the awkward period just after Walt Disney had died, a period renowned for being Disney's creative nadir.Many of the criticisms of the era can be rallied against ""Robin Hood"". The pace is off sometimes, and the plot itself isn't very cohesive (then again, the original legend is essentially a cycle of various stories and episodes). Many of the characters look like carbon copies of designs from earlier Disney films, and indeed whole sequences feature animation re-used from productions as far back as ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"".Yet for all that's going against it, ""Robin Hood"" strangely seems to work. For one thing, it has a sheer charm and spirit to it that few films can boast, and the strong appeal of the original source material arguably helps as well. In addition to it generally being a fun film, it has some good songs, including the soothing ballads ""Love"" and ""Not in Nottingham"" and the catchy ""Oo-de-Lally"" and ""Whistle Stop"".

104,atlihafsteinsson,"Deliciously animated, great adaptation with a disappointing ending",9,1 April 2010,"Could Disney ever do wrong during their golden age? As far as their adaption of Robin Hood goes, not likely. This is an absolute gem of a film, both well-written, animated, cast and presented. It takes what is already a well-known tale and adds a real depth to it. The ageless story is presented (and the movie itself acknowledges it, to my delight) in an animal kingdom form. It follows the quest of outlaw Robin Hood as he robs from the rich and gives to the poor under the nose of tyrannical Prince John and the Sheriff of Nottingham. With a little help from his friends - amongst them Little John - he just might save them from the evil lion's tyranny. But of course it's not so easy - nor is his quest for the hand of the fair Maid Marian.The animation in this movie is absolutely delicious. In the leading hands of such geniuses as Milt Kahl, Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston, I'm not surprised. The old-fashioned Disney style (pencil strokes quite evident) never fails to inspire me, and in fact is at its absolute height here, in my opinion. The character design and animation is all spot-on - Robin is a foxy fox, Little John is a not-at-all-little bear, Prince John is a lion, the Sheriff of Nottingham is an overweight wolf, Sir Hiss is a snake, the royal guards are rhinos and Prince John's squire is a crocodile. All these diverse characters are impeccably believable and entrancing to behold. Both Little John and Sir Hiss might be considered extensions of Baloo and Kaa in the Jungle Book (indeed, both retain their respective voice actors). However, this is only a passing reference, as both characters are strong enough to stand alone (not to mention is Little John more of a straight-man than Baloo, and much more responsible).For the animation itself as well as the whole animal setting, I'd say 5 stars are nowhere NEAR enough. The story is also fabulously written. Believabilty of the characters is stronger than in any Robin Hood incarnation that I've ever seen. You totally feel the despair of the poor people, and absolute hatred for Prince John and the Sheriff of Nottingham - in fact the latter is the character I personally love to loathe.However, while the story itself is quite strong, the ending is very disappointing to me. If you don't want me to spoil it for you, I strongly suggest you skip the rest of this paragraph. After a heist and a breakout of the royal jail conducted by Robin and Little John, the scene fades away from Prince John's frustration. Then when we take off again, King Richard has returned and our rooster narrator/folk singer says that ""he sort of straightened everything out."" Given the strong character- and story-build-up, this is NOT something I wanted to hear! The 'show, don't tell' rule that Disney were so good at following is broken here, to my immense frustration. Sure, we see the evil cronies in chains. But given all the loathsome things they do during the course of this film, I wanted to see them humiliated for all to see! By King Richard as well as the rest of the bunch. His return should have been emphasised much better, as a kind of symbol for the people that the bad days will end. The ending, as such, feels like a real anticlimax.But despite the disappointing ending, the movie itself is a quite impeccable visual work - fluid and eye-candyish 2-d animation with more charm than today's CGI-ridden features can even hope to achieve. Disney's Robin Hood signifies, to me, what animation is all about. And despite my faults with the ending, it remains one of my favourite films of all time - and a film which inspires me in my ambition to become an animator myself.

107,newkidontheblock,An interesting film from the post-Walt era,8,8 June 2005,"Disney's Robin Hood (1973) was the second film released after Uncle Walt's death (the first was the Jungle Book-1968). I've always liked this film for Different reasons. When I was younger, I liked it because, well...it was Disney. Everything Disney was right in my eyes. Robin Hood was one of my favorite films as a small child. Recently, I saw it again on television after not seeing it for a very long time. Now I have a whole new set of reasons for why I thoroughly enjoy this film.Ken Anderson did something quite special with Robin Hood, he combined the elements of a traditional animated Disney feature with some creative ideas of his own.One element of both Disney animated features and shorts where the use of animals instead of people where telling an unoriginal story. The story of Robin Hood had been told in many live-action movies (with Earl Flynn's performance still the standard). In the Disney film, the animators used the obvious choice of a fox for the role of Robin Hood. Maid Marian had to be a Vixen (because inter-species love is really weird). A bear was a good choice for Robin's right hand man, because as we all know, fat people make perfect sidekicks.Another Disney tradition upheld was the great animation. Ever since Snow White, Disney has been the standard for great animation. Though other animation studios tried to duplicate Disney, they we're seldom successful. The animation in Robin Hood was no exception.Robin Hood was also a very original film for Disney. The film started with a Rooster that sang folks song and was kind of a hippie. In most movies about Robin Hood he was kind of this God figure that was untouchable. In this one, Robin Hood was just a regular guy that only wanted to help his people out. He had his dreams and ambitions and faults like everyone else.In closing, Robin Hood is a great family film. Children, teenagers, and adults can enjoy it. 8 out of 10 stars.",Robin Hood

I found all the movie adaptations pretty rough and uninteresting, but that's how it was in those times. Disney however made this story into something more fun to watch. There are no humans in this animation but all the characters from the story are played by animals. Robin Hood and Maid Marianne are foxes, little John is a bear and prince John is a lion just to name a few. They are all humanized however and can talk. Humanized animals is a concept that often causes for fun scenes and this movie is nothing short of that. The funniest scenes in my opinion are between the Sheriff of Nottingham and his stupid guards, and not to forget the big fight at the tournament with Lady Cluck simulating some kind of rugby game. Yes Prince John is mean and cruel but he is also naive, childish (thumb-sucking) which makes him laughable. This is surely one to watch over and over again.

When Prince John, brother of King Richard, comes to the small town of Nottingham hijinks are in store for the Prince from bandits Robin Hodd & Little John (also the tax loving Sheriff of Nottingham greatly voiced by Paul Buttram). Also, that opening sequence by Roger Miller was fantastic. After, many problems ensue between Robin Hood & Prince John, Prince John eventually raises the taxes on all the poor people in the small town. Coming to the point where all the people of Nottingham (or at least most) are thrown into jail. Even when the sheriff comes to collect taxes from Friar Tuck, whom he gets into a short fight with, the Friar is thrown into jail as well! All in all ""Robin Hood"" is a great classic film to enjoy with anyone.",Robin Hood
110,Ken-120,An unfortunately weak film with a few good points.,6,8 May 1999,"While this is great fun for kids, as an adult furry fan, I do have to face facts about this film.Namely, this is indeed the weakest of the Disney animated features.  The story structure is completely disjointed, being basicly a series of sequences patched together almost hastily. The characters, especially the title character, are largely cardboard with little depth.  The anachronisms interfere with the atmosphere of the film.  If they're using furries for the characters, then it would have made better sense to keep the medieval settings as authentic as possible to make it feel more believable.  The American accents for some of the characters like Little John, Alan a Dale and the Sheriff feel most inappropriate for an English setting and for the most part, using American Country music for the soundtrack just clashes too hard.  Finally, the animation is unforgivably slapdash for Disney's standards, with reused animation sequences predominating the footage, giving the whole film a cheap look.On the plus side, the characters, especially Robin Hood and Maid Marian, are beautifully rendered and an artistic inspiration for funny animal fans for decades.  Also, the song, ""Not in Nottingham"" is quite haunting for a country music song and some of the dialogue is quite witty.All in all, kids will enjoy this film as they probably wouldn't notice the flaws, but I would wish for a D2V sequel, as far as writing is concerned. They have an opportunity for big improvements.",Robin Hood
111,aaronjamesmaximus,The stupid cringey version of Robin Hood,1,21 August 2017,"Now the plot is like most Robin Hood stories robin and his band steal from the rich and gives to the poor fights the Sheriff of Nottingham and King John but with anthropomorphic animals. However, this film seems to begin in the middle of the story after Robin has lost lordship and been branded a traitor to the crown and an outlaw however, none of that is ever mentioned in this film as it is lazy in its storytelling and would rather begin in the middle than at the beginning like most well-structured stories. Now this version of Robin is a fox and tries to be suave and witty like Errol Flynn but comes off as an annoying idiot with a cockney accent. This version of Maid Marian is bland and boring who loves Robin however, it is never shown as to why she loves him only hinted at because the writers are lazy, also make sure not to google her with safe search off otherwise you'll need a lot of bleach. Little John is basically Baloo from the jungle book and recycles some of his animations from the jungle book as well as the same voice actor. There also a King John, who is a lion, but he and his followers are overly incompetent to the point of nearing mental retardation King John is also shown to be a total coward (not much of a Lionheart ironically) and the only reason he is unable to outwit Robin is because of his sheer incompetence.The film starts off with a stupid chicken narrating the tale of Robin Hood and says this is the real version of Robin Hood and the cringe overflows from there. After an annoying song and dance Robin and Little John walk through the forest while a song is playing about them being in the forest (redundant I know). Then the Sheriff of Nottingham and his men ambush the pair of imbeciles, but being incompetent oafs, they lose sight of him and easily give up their hunt further illustrating their stupidity. They then dress up as gypsies and do what gypsies do steal and though they say they are not robbers their eyes seem to gleam greedily when they spy the king's hoard of gold and proceed to steal it from him while he and his men just sit there like rocks completely unaware they being robbed even though little John clearly just fill his pockets with gold in broad daylight no one notices and they leave with their pockets full and their enemies stumped. What further illustrates that this version of robin is greedy and vain is when he only gives a small bag of gold to a poor family and is never seen giving more than that meaning he and Little John greedily kept it for themselves what irony.Then the worst part of the film occurs the annoying children who are just disgustingly cute and cry like little babies and they just make the film even worse luckily after about 10 minutes they are gone for the moment. Then King John sets up an archery contest, which should be near the end of the story not in the beginning, however they did start the story in the middle, but it still feels rushed. Of course, robin wins and wears a disguise that would only fool a blind beggar, but it fools the idiot king and his guards and if robin had not been so egotistical about winning he could have left, and the king would have been none the wiser. But eventually even the moronic King John catches on and tells his men to seize robin. However Little John can sneak up behind king John and of course when robin is found out he sticks a dagger in john's back telling him to let Robin go or he'll cut him. But the sheriff notices the king's strange behavior of letting robin go and sees little John is threatening the king and sneaks up on John who get away without a scratch. They then escape there's a cringey scene with Robin and Maid Marian.The sheriff of Nottingham then arrests friar tuck and the king announces he will be hanged to lure out robin into yet another trap, but being an incompetent oaf messes that up too and Robin is able to rescue all the captives in the castle because the guards are brainless buffoons. But then as they are escaping robin gets too greedy for his own good and steals too much gold waking up king john who alerts his men to attack but they fail as they lack even mediocre intelligence then everyone is about to escape but robin back goes back to save an annoying child at the risk of his own life and is cornered by the king's men but with them being idiots they let him escape and he flees to the tower where the sheriff is waiting for him and chases him while setting the tower ablaze and in the best scene in the whole movie it looks like robin about to become fried fox but then jumps into the moat surviving the fall and the arrows being fired at him but makes them wait before surface to provide false drama then they all escape and king Richard shows up to arrest his brother and Robin marries Maid Marian and become an in-law instead of an outlaw. This robin is not the dashing hero like Errol Flynn in the Adventures of Robin Hood nor is he the more hardened warrior like Sean Connery in Robin and Marian the only other robin he's comparable to is Kevin Costner, who also made a mockery of Robin Hood, but at least that version didn't help to spawn the cringe inducing furries who draw animal porn and dress up in stupid costumes, yuck.",Robin Hood
112,Puck-20,It stinks!,1,27 November 2006,"The Hanna/Barberaism of the Disney studios continued (after the plodding and dull ""Aristocats"") with this lame excuse to make money off of kids. A few other reviewers have pointed out the jerky and often grinding-to-a-slow-crawl plot and the characters that were more wooden than Pinocchio. What bothered me, and I mean what bothered me to the point of wincing when it was originally released, was how the people at Disney were simply plum out of ideas. You really can appreciate Walt Disney's genius at telling a story, and the team he left behind simply couldn't pull it off. So, they decided to recycle some old animation in the hopes that no one would notice. First, they put some clothes on Baloo, then they use animated scenes from Snow White, the Aristocats, and the Jungle Book just to cut corners and hope that no one noticed. What were they thinking? Even though Maid Marian's dance moves were so obviously from Snow White, at least that film was older than the kids who went to see this movie. But to rip off animation from the previous two movies? Particularly the high-points of the previous two movies? The only good thing they did was use the Hamster Dance in the opening credits. Pity they didn't have any hamsters dancing, though. Just recycled clips from the movie itself.",Robin Hood
113,JBingeWatcher,Would better work as a tv show,4,27 December 2020,"Don't get me wrong. I totally get why this movie is iconic for many people, but in my opinion it's not a good movie. It would probably work better as a tv show. It doesn't tell the Robin Hood legend with justice. Robin Hood himself is a very blend character. The animation was fine. The voice acting, soundtrack and animation works good for me.
The story didn't work for me. It was a couple of short stories that ends with a nice final, but the stories itself was boring.",Robin Hood
114,dustinkdye,Disney's charming take on the legend is an overlooked treasure,6,29 July 2013,"For most kids these days, their introduction to Robin Hood is through this Disney animated classic. All subsequent Robin Hood movies are measured against this one, and no number of misguided revisions of the legend can diminish the charm of this cartoon.""Robin Hood"" was released in an overlooked period of Disney animation, long after ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" and ""Dumbo,"" and long before ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""The Lion King."" ""Robin Hood"" doesn't really live up to the earlier classics, nor is it as good as the more recent films. But as a minor Disney classic, it is still a charming movie.Allan-a-Dale, a lute-strumming rooster, informs us that this is the legend as it is told in the Animal Kingdom, which is basically the same as the Human Kingdom's version, except with animals. It contains familiar Robin Hood legends, such as the archery tournament, although sometimes with a twist. For example, Robin Hood must rescue Friar Tuck from hanging rather than Will Stutely.True to other Disney cartoons, the songs and animation are cute. You will have a hard time resisting the urge to smile hearing the opening song. Oscar winner Peter Ustinov (Stanley Kubrick's ""Spartacus"") is especially good as the voice of Prince John.However, while the film is relatively short (83 minutes), the story seems to drag after the one-hour mark because the movie doesn't follow the typical rhythm that has been culturally ingrained in our minds. After the archery tournament and ensuring madcap action sequence one hour into the movie, most of the conflicts up to that point have been resolved. The film comes up with a second conflict for the last 20-some minutes. The short movie had a hard time retaining my attention during the final act.The movie also had some historical inaccuracies that were laughable for anyone familiar with medieval English history. In one song bashing Prince John, they said that he will not be remembered for the laws he passed, but rather for being the phony king of England. John is remembered today for passing (under duress) the Magna Carta, an early forerunner to the Constitution. Prince John is cursed throughout the film for imposing crushing taxes, considered by all to be unjust since only the true king, Richard the Lionheart (literally a lion in the cartoon), has the right to tax the people. The film conveniently fails to mention that Prince John had to raise taxes to pay for King Richard's crusade. King Richard eventually returns and arrests Prince John, so he can never harm the English people again. An epilogue pointing out that John would reign as the king of England for 17 years after Richard would have been warranted.But expecting historical accuracy from a Disney film is like expecting gourmet food from McDonald's, so that isn't a major criticism. (One joke I heard around the time James Cameron's ""Titanic"" was released was that if Disney had made ""Titanic,"" not only would Leonardo DiCaprio have lived, but he would have prevented the ship from sinking.)""Robin Hood"" is nevertheless a satisfying introduction to the culturally significant legend that will appeal to Disney's intended audience.",Robin Hood
115,MyNeighborFanboy,Oh boy oh boy....,2,30 October 2010,"I don't like this movie.I'm not alone in my distaste for Robin Hood. During its making, whispers spread among the staff (Ward Kimball and director Wolfgang Reitherman at least are recorded as complaining to each other). This, to me, is the absolute nadir of finance driven animated trash, akin to a Shrek sequel in artistry. To its credit, though, it is handled by master animators and designers, but this is hindered by the fact that every good piece of animation has to be reused once more to save time.As a Robin Hood adaptation, this one is quite far from its source material. Rather than the legendary folk hero, we get a pussified interpretation who dresses up in drag rather than resort to heroics and trots about carelessly so that he and Phil Harris are easily ambushed by a troop of run cycles. Did I mention cycles? Anyway, Peter Ustinov at least lends some comic voice acting to Prince John, but he doesn't exactly make for much of a villain. Phil Harris plays Baloo as Little John, and three films with Baloo is a bit much for me. Sir Hiss is Kaa...and that's all anyone can say. Maid Marion and her faithful steward Bess...I mean ""Clucky""...are basically useless and oblivious to what's going on around them. Pat Buttram's kind of enjoyable as the Sheriff, but, again, it's hard to take any of these villains seriously on any level when they're all played for cheap laughs. None of the characters endear much, and at least half are basically reused characters from past Disney projects.As for the plot...there is no plot.Instead, we get an aimless series of episodes that advance nothing and provide nothing but cheap, largely unfunny gags. One finds it hard to thrill over Robin Hood garbed in drag when we want to see him doing something masculine and likable. The party sequence in the middle is a masterpiece of suck, tethering together reused animation from The Aristocats, Snow White, and The Jungle Book while basically wasting the audience's time with a lousy song that I can't even recall at the moment. Wrapping it all up is a bit of exposition that essentially skips over the climax of the story, like a final insult to its stupid, stupid audience that will buy into anything with the Disney name.Moving on to animation, this film features all the masters of the last few films, who normally elevate even mediocre material like The Aristocats, and they do contribute a few impressive pieces to this. Milt Kahl does a fun and technically tricky bit with the Sheriff where he bounces down the street in perspective in a very characterized way. The problem is that it proceeds to be reused TWICE. Unfortunately, the rest of the animation is so occupied by walk cycles and reused animation and COPIED animation from films past that whatever virtues are contained wear out their welcome and good pieces are harder to come by.To be fair, the design values aside from the budget cheating are solid, and even with the appalling number of shortcuts the animation is never any less than well crafted otherwise. But what's the takeway? No breakthroughs are made on a technological or artistic level, no characters stand out, no scenes make an impression, and I swear the only bits I can remember are the thumb sucking and the fact that Robin Hood's anthropomorphized character design kind of looks like the primary inspiration for ""furries"" (do NOT look that term up).I've heard from a few folks who worked on this, and have never, in my entire life, heard any of them say they were proud of it. The thing's a cynical sucker punch to anyone who enjoys Disney films, a cesspool of mediocrity and disrespect that doesn't even think its supporters are worth giving competent production values. Yogi Bear and The Flintstones are more exciting to me. Heavy Traffic from the same year also took shortcuts, but out of necessity rather than greed, and actually managed to be an excellent film where its rough animation worked for its themes. I'm not against cheap animation, and think such limitations can actually lead to some of the most interesting animation around when the people involved are putting their all into wrangling descent expressiveness and motion out of their material.But Robin Hood is just half-assed. Usually, The Black Cauldron is brought up when discussing bad Disney movies, but that film had something called originality to some extent in the context of Disney's work. Robin Hood is, for lack of a better term, animated inbreeding.",Robin Hood
116,Centaurus3,2nd of the 8 in the Dark Era,4,26 May 2013,"This was first film that was completely done after Walt Disney's death (it was approved, produced, and released after his death, unlike his predecessors). While this film was a modest success, at this point it was clear that animated films were not the company's strong point.This film practically your typical Robin Hood story, with Anamorphic animals. Robin Hood and Little John rob for the poor and from the rich. Robin Hood and Maid Marian are in love with each other. The ruler taxed his people to the point that they are in poverty. Will Robin Hood get caught robbing?The characters in this movie are bey black and white. Robin Hood is the generic hero, Maid Marian is the generic maiden, Little John is the generic goofy best friend. The tiger ruler (forgot his name) is the most interesting character in the film, as he is a whiny, lazy brat, but also extremely threatening. All the other side characters are not that memorable.The songs in this movie are....decent? Thy are not memorable, except for the love song ""Love"" which is a good love song. The rest sound like a bunch of random noise that is trying to mix British and Country music.The animation is not good at all. The Xerography is not used well at all, and this movie has the most borrowed animation (tracing back to Cinderella and The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr Toad). The entire dance scene is borrowed from films like The Aristocats, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, and The Jungle Book. The film is just not appealing to the eye.To put it bluntly, this film is a mess. Bad animation and soundtrack, generic characters, and a good plot that is not executed well. There are some filler scenes that just drag on and on. What does somewhat save this film is the fun and charm that it has, and even that could not save the film. The company's magic continued to diminish with this movie.",Robin Hood
117,pmullan-54285,The Foxy Version of Robin Hood,9,27 June 2016,"""Robin Hood""I love the old animated Disney films. Even the lesser known or poorer ones such as ""Oliver and Company"" or ""Aristocats"". The charm to Robin Hood is his persona and his relationships off of the other characters. His rapport with Little John is heart-warming and I do like the sense of camaraderie between them. His love/romance with Maid Marian is sweet, though I do wish that more time was devoted to it. In fact, Maid Marian vanishes in the third act of the film and only appears at the end of the films during their marriage. Where did she go? Was she just sitting in the forest and waiting for the action to pass her by? She displays some ferocity and bravery when she throws a pie in a guard's face during the action sequence in the middle of the film (Which is a hilarious and greatly done set piece). I am a sucker for romance and I do love the chemistry that the two foxes share, it's something that you can all sit down and enjoy. The supporting characters are enjoyably fun and memorable. The one thing that old Disney films (and some newer ones) can do so well is the side characters. You remember them all and you love seeing them get their way. King John and Hiss are OTT and it sounds like the actors are having an absolute ball with their roles. I can't say I didn't like them, as even if they're are evil, they provide some hysterical lines. The kids didn't annoy me here, as I thought they would. They're adorable and I did like their enthusiasm of following after Robin Hood. The action is great and the final climax is bundles of fun. I would say more, but the charming main character, the adorable romance and the fun side-characters provide a good 80 minutes of fun filled fluff.",Robin Hood

The music, while not exactly dazzling, is fun and enjoyable. The characters are irresistible and their voices match perfectly. Phil Harris, Brian Bedford, Monica Evans, Peter Ustinov and Terry-Thomas play their roles well and bring forth the personalities of each character from the charming wit of Robin Hood to the sweet demure of Maid Marian. The script is chock-full of witty banter and memorable speech. All things considered, Robin Hood is a lovely movie with something for everyone to enjoy.",Robin Hood

120,doozer333,Disney's Red Headed Step-child,7,19 June 2005,"I loved this movie as a kid, as did just about every person I know. So it works for the youngins. As an adult, and an animation fan, I was surprised to learn that this movie is sort of the Disney studio's secret shame. I had nothing but fond memories of it, after all. And I could name at least a dozen Disney films that I would have put ahead of it on my Most Crappy list. I very recently watched it on television after many years, and yes, it is definitely flawed. The quality of the animation is terrible, and the lack of an over arching story makes the whole thing seem frivolous, like it was made for TV and not for a big studio release. There are holes in the narrative, scenes that should exist that don't, and scenes that have no reason to exist that do. And I think the somewhat random decision to cast the film with animals lends to the Saturday morning vibe as well.But there's enough cool things peaking out from under all the half-assery that rescues the film just enough for it to be enjoyable. Peter Ustinov turns in an excellent, excellent performance as Prince John, at turns hysterical and genuinely nasty. Brian Bedford oozes easy going charm as Robin. He's probably turned in the second most likable performance of the character captured on film. He's just unfortunately delivering it through the poorly animated mouth of a cartoon fox. And though the actual quality of the animation is poor, some of the character animation is pretty clever and expressive. And I have to applaud the choice to add Roger Miller to the mix as a folkie, possibly pot-smoking minstrel rooster. His character adds a cool, Earthy vibe to the proceedings and as others have mentioned, his song, Not in Nottingham, actually sort of works as a blues song. Weird.So Robin Hood is definitely not the epic tale Disney was capable of churning out in its hey days, but I dug it as a kid, and I still dig it today. You know, looking back at all my reviews on this site, it seems I mostly leap to the defense of classically bad films that I like anyway. That's OK, I guess. Someone has to.",Robin Hood

122,thedecimator1337,I wish all Disney movies were like this.,8,8 September 2015,"Marked for spoilers just in case. May still be relevant despite the ageing of the story. For starters, I wish all Disney movies were like this. Like pretty much all Disney productions, this adaptation is horrendously inaccurate to its source material, that being both the original legends and the ""canonical"" story dramatised by the Robin Hood: Legend of Sherwood video game. However, this movie is greatly different from the others because of the prologue. Our Narrator of sorts, Rooster!Alan-a-Dale, starts with a prologue saying basically that this movie is going to be an original work. Don't expect the source material, expect a new story fashioned out of it by Disney for their own use. That is the huge difference right there. The annoying inaccuracy and such are still there, but it's better to establish that right off the bat so we can put that aside and speak about the movie. As for the movie itself, barring canonical fidelity of course, it is a decent production. It has its low points (mainly composed of cringeworthy humour and ""eccentric"" for lack of a better word bits), but for the most part it is classic Disney. Anachronistic, musical, funny, and quite memorable. One thing about Disney is that its work is memorable. Whether for good or for bad, it is always memorable. As for the story itself, it is internally consistent (mostly) and fairly amusing in itself. I don't recommend it for serious social watching, but I highly recommend it for casual enjoyment and especially for middle to low intensity class kids (the high ones are better off in the serious circles). Lastly, I raise my rating for the depiction of Friar Tuck. I'm not in favour of equality and representation and all of that, but as long as you people are at it you ought to raise the rating for having a legitimate priest in there, acting pious and zealous for the Lord.",Robin Hood

Of course, the people of today do two things with this masterpiece: leave it unnoticed, or bash it to the ground, so they can watch some overrated stuff. Backgrounds: supreme, wonderful. Character designs: Done by the oh-so-wonderful Don Bluth, plus, this film has the most funniest villains ever to be shown on the silver screen (who wouldn't laugh at that mama's boy, Prince John?) and it as all kinds of emotion here: cute, mushy romance, a bit of drama here and there, and lots and lots of humor. Also, that little rabbit kid, Skippy, is one of the most adorable cartoon kids I've ever seen.

This is the movie i can watch 50x a year (maybe more) and still not get bored. (I can tell you every line from the screenplay in the Dutch language 😂)
What i really like about Robin Hood is that the story tells from the aspect of the Animal Kingdom.
Robin is a Fox, Little John is a bear, Prince John is a Lion. I wonder who from Disney came with that brilliant idea.
All the animals in this movie are great but Sir Hiss (The Snake) is the most funny one to me.
Robin Hood is a classic you have to own in your personal collection.P.s between you and me. As a kid i was very scared of Allan a' Dale (The Rooster) 😂",Robin Hood
131,dmne,Definitely NOT one of Disney's best or even close,4,7 July 2006,"The story is weak. The animation looks more like Hanna-Barbera second-rate TV animation than the quality Disney was known for prior to Walt Disney's death and the ""Little Mermaid""/""Lion King"" era. Let's be honest. Most of the animated films that came out of the Disney studios post ""Jungle Book"" up until ""Little Mermaid"" were quickly put together and seriously lacking in what the earlier animated films had. The only exceptions to this were ""The Many Adventures of Winnie The Pooh"", which was a compilation of the Winnie-The-Pooh shorts shown in the 60s, and possibly ""The Fox And The Hound"". Disney did much better in 70s and 80s with re-releases of earlier films than new releases during this time period. Unfortunately, someone was not doing their job during that time. Sadly, the same thing has happened with the post-""Lion King"" animated films that Disney has made.

The animation is flat, many elements are recycled from earlier Disney films, the story is fragmented, Robin and Marian's relationship is given little establishment or development, the run time is waaaaaay too short and Robin doesn't get nearly enough screen time. All these problems are the essential formula for a sad excuse for a movie. That being said, I love this film. I love everything about it. I love the atmosphere. I love the characters. I love the humor. There is something about Robin Hood that just works; the question is what and how. Here's what I think: Disney's version of Robin Hood is not so much an adaptation of the legend, but a parody. A large majority of the characters are given large alterations, other than being anthropomorphic animals. The biggest example is the villain Prince John. The powerful, greedy tyrant is portrayed as a cowardly crybaby that can't overcome issues from his childhood. The Sheriff of Nottingham, a corrupted brute is portrayed as an obese, bumbling oaf. Friar Tuck, despite being a preacher has some traits one would hardly expect of a man of the church. The effect is hilarious. The entire cast has a lot of energy and make for some strong entertainment. Only Robin Hood himself is a somewhat accurate reflection of his legendary counterpart. But violence is substituted with a clamor for disguise. The cast and humor is aided through some very impressive and witty writing. This creates an incredible atmosphere of charm, whimsy and fun. It comes off as overwhelmingly campy, but it's supposed to be. The film says right from the get-go, ""this is our version and we're going to have fun with it."" Robin Hood has a smile on his face the entire movie, and his mood reflects on the audience. The effect is strange in that most of the films' problems actually work towards its advantage. The lackluster animation gives the movie a down to earth and rustic feel, appropriate for the setting and events. The recycled bits (due to budget cuts during the film's production) come off as a tribute to earlier Disney films and a mild nostalgia trip. Robin and Marian's rather prompt relationship works in a sense. We knew before the film started that Robin and Marian would fall in love, so why waste time with the tedious buildup. The flaws certainly glare once the film is over, but completely melt away when it's playing, even on repeated viewings. I've always believed that a film's actual quality is much more important than its likability and entertainment value. But for Robin Hood I think I'll make an exception. I'd go so far as to call Robin Hood a guilty pleasure, but I don't feel guilty at all.",Robin Hood
135,SmithWinston,Disney's best,10,29 October 2005,"I've watched Robin Hood since before I could understand language. Even back then it entertained me, enough for my parents to have to play it whenever they wanted to keep me out of trouble. One would expect that anything that can hold the attention of a toddler is not going to have the same effect on an adult. I am glad to say that it does. I can watch this film today with the same eagerness, the same enjoyment and the same suspension of knowledge of what's going to happen. Who could help doing otherwise? It's first class storytelling.There are the age-old characters, archetypes as well known as the story itself. In a twist of genius, the tale is set in the animal world. Robin Hood, everyone's hero, brought to magnificent life by a fox and given a dashing yet endearing voice. There's his ladylove, the long-lashed, elegant, eminently lovable Maid Marian, also a fox and just as perfectly voiced. One look at Marian, and it's easy to understand why Robin is so lost in his dreams of her that he ruins the stew he's been stirring.Prince John, however likable the others, has somehow topped my list. Fittingly chosen to be a mane-less lion (compare his appearance with his brother Richard who has an ample mane), constantly whining for his mother when thwarted and complaining about Richard, he is the best representation of John I've ever seen. One mustn't forget his penchant for alliterating, in especial reference to his much put-upon sidekick/adviser Sir Hiss, a snake. Priceless gems like ""Procrastinating Python"", ""Slithering Serpent"" and of course the irresistible ""You eel in snake's clothing"" can all be heard directed at the pitiable Sir Hiss whenever John is frustrated in his plans to capture the elusive Robin. The unfortunate duo plays off each other very well. It must be said that whoever thought of getting Sir Peter Ustinov to voice the role of P.J. should have been promoted instantly. The late, brilliant Ustinov is greatly missed, but he lives on in his wonderful comedic works. His part here is right up there with his best performances. No one could have done greater justice to the younger brother who (rightly) feels that his governance compares unfavourably with Richard's.A few other characters deserve to be mentioned. Little John, a bear very reminiscent of Jungle Book's Baloo, is light-hearted, trustworthy and the perfect companion and friend for our Robin. On one occasion early on, they have a great outing together as cross-dressers and use their very believable disguise to steal P.J. for everything he has on him. As for his voice, Little John's carefree American accent works very well alongside the British ones of the others. The lady-in-waiting to Marian, Clucky, is a brave lass and Friar Tuck is a kind old fellow. There are also the kids in the family of rabbits who understandably admire and adore Robin and Marian.The script is smashing. What with the comedy, the heroic and witty lines for the good guys and the hysterical silliness of the sour villains of the story, this is a winner. It's always fun and never grows tired. The little ditty about Prince John's incompetence that goes around (""too late to be known as John the first, he's sure to be known as John the worst"") is very in keeping with the rest of this film's tone. And who can forget the sheer madness of such a line as ""I sentence you to sudden, instant and even immediate death"", courtesy of Prince John of course.It's not only comedy, because to top it all off, this film must have the best confession of love ever filmed. Although it works infinitely better when you watch it, I will attempt to sketch it here. Caught, tied up, sentenced and threatened with execution, Robin looks into Marian's expressive eyes and says ""Marian my darling, I love you more than life itself"". Her emotional response is an equally memorable one to behold. More sweetness inevitably follows in the eventual escape, but I'll leave that for your viewing pleasure.The film wouldn't be complete without a fitting climax, and to satisfy us all, we've been given a good one. Climbing to the top of a turret, Robin has to leap down into the moat to avoid the fires that are close on his heels. His friends down below look on to see where he surfaces and are dismayed to find Robin appearing nowhere yet, to the delight of Prince John and Sir Hiss. It's a nice tug at the heartstrings. Although initially all hope seems lost, we know that the story isn't finished until the deserving Robin gets to be with his Marian and all's right with Nottingham and England.Disney surpassed themselves with this one. It's much more than the sum of its parts (voice talent and likable characters, witty script, character designs, plotting). Having watched this a countless number of times in the past, I look forward to continuing to do so.",Robin Hood
136,Mecha_Brendo,"Great soundtrack, animation,and voice acting, but over all, a boring movie.",5,15 October 2017,"I used to have a tape of this movie when I was younger, and I always remembered watching it quite a few times. When I thought back to the movie, I couldn't really recall about the movie, except the music, and a few random moments. I saw this was on Netflix, and I re-watched the movie with some friends. We all had the same reaction; the music, like most Disney films, was great, but this time, the plot was boring. The whole movie seems a bit episodic, and unfocused. I don't regret seeing it, though. This movie should be fine for kids, just something pop in, and entertain them for a while. Of you're older, I'd say 15 and older, this movie is going to be more boring than entertaining.",Robin Hood
137,mmpenrod,over looked,10,13 May 2007,"This film was my first movie as a kid. My dad is a history teacher and he wanted me and my sister to know the story I guess. It's full of witty humor , action , music, and romance (Pretty much any type of film rolled into one). At the time the movie was released there were other films out (The Jungle Book , The Aristocats) so most people don't really think it was a Disney cartoon . As a young adult watching it, I find memories flying back to me. The highlight song of the film is the ""Phony King Of England"". It's bouncy , catchy and I still find myself singing or humming along. The highlight scene is definitely the big fight at the end. There is one scare but in true Disney fashion the bad guys faces the consequences and the hero and his lady love are married.But it's one film that I certainly enjoy even now and will be thrilled to have my children watch it too someday.",Robin Hood
138,literarycherub,Disney's very finest offering and one of the best movies of all-time,10,4 January 2009,"Just saw this movie for the first time this year and rewatched it the other day. The first time I saw it, I thought it was utterly brilliant. The second time? Utterly brilliant. One of the few films that remains just as excellent on rewatch and possibly even gets better.I'm shocked and disconcerted to hear it's considered by some to be one of the worst classic Disney films. If this movie is an really an example of Disney when it's being half-assed, then I wish it would half-ass its movies more often, because the result of their supposed insouciance is a wonderful, delightful, and perfect movie, an extremely charming, fun, and well-written interpretation of ""Robin Hood"".I think one thing that seems to throw some people off about it is that it's not like any Disney movie that came before it. To me, that's part of what makes it so fantastic. Many of the jokes and scenes are ones I wouldn't expect to see from a Disney movie, and it seemed like this was the first Disney movie that wasn't afraid of taking a few risks with its characters, jokes, tone, structure, et cetera. And the risks they took with comedy stand the test of time; the jokes in this movie are not dated or forced in the slightest.The lack of an overarching plot was another thing I love about the movie. It all flowed very well and sucked me into the world of Nottingham, as the narrative depicted a time period in the lives of the denizens. Instead of offering a formulaic, beginning-middle-end type of plot, it offered several episodes of different events in Nottingham, each intriguing and engaging.These episodes also balanced each other out quite well in tone; we got to see both the carefree, down-to-earth moments and the darker plights of all the characters, making the whole movie feel very well-rounded and very real. It wasn't as if the movie portrayed everything in black-and-white. There were shades of happiness in the sadness, and it was great to see the characters sometimes be able to forget about their struggles for the time being and just live in the moment. The happy moments made me feel happy and free, and the sadder moments touched me. The emotion was handled in a very rare way: it was subtle and understated, executed perfectly, not overdone, not forced, and not unconvincing.While this lighthearted yet dark, exciting, and yet down-to-earth tone and the sporadic structure were two things I really love about the movie, I think its strongest point lies in its characters. They were not cookie-cut-outs of their traditional roles and were subtly multifaceted. Robin Hood himself was not exactly a perfect Prince Charming, but yet was much more charming than any of the heroes that preceded him (and most of those who were his successors). He was engaging in every scene he was featured; he was funny, compassionate and selfless, intelligent and clever, jovial and fun despite his mission of great somberness, and is easily one of the most likable and quite admirable Disney heroes.Maid Marian could have been typical in her role, but instead she still came off as quite unique, as she carried with her none of the usual melodrama and overreactions of most Disney female characters; she was instead genuinely lighthearted, caring, and kind-hearted, a perfect match for Robin Hood. Little John, while not shown as often as I'd like, served as a perfect foil for Robin Hood in the scenes he did have, was just a very entertaining character overall, and really was the one to save Robin Hood from Prince John...he was an overlooked hero, for sure, and his friendship with Robin was endearing.Of course, Prince John and Hiss were hilarious. John's combination of being utterly insane, pathetic, spoiled, and at times just plain stupid made for an extremely funny and interesting character, and Hiss was a perfect counterpart for him. All the other characters--from the family of bunnies to Lady Cluck to the singing rooster to Friar Tuck to the sheriff--each had a discriminating personality all their own and all contributed something worthwhile to the film. It was definitely an ensemble film, completed with a greatly diversified and captivating ensemble of characters that play off each other wonderfully.So, the only flaw I find in it is the one that's already been mentioned on here several times: the reused animation and choreography. That's not a major detriment at all though, and I really couldn't care less about it when the overall package of the movie was so spectacular. This movie just oozes with great spirit, camaraderie, fun, charm and delivers the very true and relevant message of the power of unity, hope, and love for one's fellow man in times of hardship. It's a pure joy to watch, my favorite Disney movie, and one of my favorite movies of all-time.",Robin Hood
139,PekkaTurunen,A nostalgia trip,8,30 November 2003,"When I was about four or five years old I used to watch this film almost every day in my day care. Then a couple of weeks ago I was discussing with my friend about animation movies and it came up that he had this important piece of my childhood on VHS. So of course I borrowed it and watched it for the first time in about 13 years. I remembered surprisingly many scenes.Watching this movie wasn't as big event as it was years ago, but I still find it quite enjoyable. There were some funny mistakes in the translation from English to Finnish, but nothing crucial. I think I'll watch this a couple of times again for the old times sake before I give the tape back to my friend. :) 8/10",Robin Hood
140,Metal_Wolf,Robin Hood: The film that birthed many a fur,5,29 February 2016,"When I was young, I loved watching Disney films with my family. From Snow White & The Seven Dwarfs to Brother Bear, I loved every film. So, with Robin Hood being one of their classics, you'd think I'd like it too! Unfortunately, even when I was young, I never cared much for this film...but I couldn't stop watching it either. Why is that? Was it the animation? The characters? The story? The anthro characters?Let's talk about the story. If you know the legend of Robin Hood, then this movie is nothing new. It's basically Robin Hood and his buddy Little John robbing the rich and giving to the poor. It's a classic Robin Hood story that's been told many of times, but Disney does manage to find a way to make it creative, which is the use of anthropomorphic characters. Sadly, the story does fall apart near the middle once half of the villagers are jailed, cause by then it seems like the story is on fast-forward as it races towards a, surprisingly, tense action- packed finale. The ending also suffers from being classic Disney fare, UNLESS you look at the alternate ending, which actually ends the story a bit better and a better explanation pertaining to Prince John's punishment.Thankfully, the characters save this movie from being almost boring. First, you got the main man himself, Robin Hood. Portrayed as a fox, he is the prince of thieves, but not your standard thief. Instead of going for the poor, he goes for the rich to give to the poor. His design is decent for the time, though he suffers from the 'Disney Big Eye Syndrome' at times, especially when the film focuses on his face straight-on. There's also his friend and cohort, Little John, whom I'm just gonna say this, is a straight copy of Baloo from The Jungle Book in terms of both design and characteristics. Yes, I know this film does copy from the aforementioned Jungle Book and I will touch on it in a bit, but if you want to know what Little John is like, watch Baloo in that film and you'll see tons of similarities. Moving on, we got Maid Marian, who is sadly very under-used. Unlike other adaptations of the tale, here she is literally only in three scenes: The beginning where she is playing bad-mitten and kisses one of the rabbit kids, the archery scene and finally the ending. You'd think she would have a good amount of screen time, but she ends up being wasted in her role (Though, I'll give the film this: Her design does make her cute). As for the villains, they are some of the funniest villains Disney had made in a while. I like how Prince John, while ruthless, is more or less reduced to a momma's boy and when stuff doesn't go to plan, ends up sucking his thumb. His assistant Sir Hiss, though, ends up being much like Maid Marian as in being wasted potential. As for the Sheriff Of Nottingham, well, dude's a douche. I was tempted to peg him as the worst character but he is saved by one thing: His voice actor. Voiced by the late Pat Buttram, he manages to bring a bit of goofiness to the character and, at times, a bit of Mister Haney in there as well. With the rest of the characters, they're just there and somewhat forgettable, with a few having some cool moments, so there is not much to say.Like all of Disney's classic animated films, the animation here is beautiful at times. The backgrounds are a treat to look at and the characters are animated realistically but keeping their animal traits in the movement as well. But, there is a problem with the animation. The problem being is that it, well, is infamously known for copying a lot of sequences and animation cells from the previously released films 'Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs', 'The Aristocats', and 'The Jungle Book', with the most infamous scene in the film being the Dance Scene near the middle of the film. Not only are moves reused from the previous aforementioned films, but it is a shot-for-shot remake of all the dance scenes from those films. Sure, you can attribute this to a smaller budget, but they could've at least made some newer dance animation cells for this film instead of reusing so many from those films.Now let us return to a question I asked earlier: Why did I return to watch this film so many times even though I never cared for the film? Well, it wasn't because of the anthro characters, the story, nor the animation. It was because it was a Disney film that, to me, didn't feel like the usual Disney fare. Unlike their previous films, this one felt more like a live-action film then a animated film, if that makes sense. I think that's why I returned to watch it constantly. It felt like a mature Disney film then what they were known for back in the day.In conclusion, Robin Hood, while it has it faults, ranks up there as one of Disney classic animated films, I still do recommend this film to any Disney fan out there.",Robin Hood
141,CleoMarie,Robin Hood,10,21 November 2006,"Walt Disney's Robin Hood is one of the only entirely animated Disney features I've seen that I can recall. I've enjoyed all of the Disney movies that I've seen, but this would be #1 on my list. The use of animals being all of the characters is very clever, considering that very few people would watch it other than to judge whether they like it or not. If you DON'T like this movie, give it away or donate it to a homeless shelter. If you DO like it, share it with other people that you think might like it. If you like this movie but don't have a copy of it, check around for places that do. So, rent or buy your copy of 'Robin Hood' ASAP.My rating: 10 out of 10. ^_^ ^__^",Robin Hood

Funnily enough I find it the most charming and human of all the Disney movies I've seen, despite it being played by animals. It could be the timeless humor and joyfulness in it, the theme of oppression against evil, the down to earth music or the lack of ornamentation. Or maybe it's simply the digressions and the flaws that does it. It's like a long therm relationship, where you love the other person as much because of her flaws as for her good qualities.

OK, maybe the animation isn't that good and has its flaws, but when you see it you forget everything they told you and enjoy as a child. Really, actually it's much better than many kiddie movies that promised to be great and finally they only promoted toys (do I have to name them?). But the best is that it has that classic Disney spirit that you can find in so many classics like ""The Jungle Book"", ""Bambi"". It has some really good characters (specially Prince John- when you see it you'll know why), some songs are really good (""Not in Nottingham"")and you have a really good time watching it.

They like to act out some of the silly scenes, especially of Prince John. And I don't have to explain anything to my kids because of lines being written over their heads. I think this tells us where we were in the early 70's for children's entertainment and where we are today in the 00's.

This is a film with not much drama in it and there's no need to over-analyze anything because it's the way it is. It's light and you watch it for the fun of it.

I guess that sir Hiss is the changed name of Guy Gisborne.This is not one of the best Disney movies, but still very good. It has action, adventure, humor, romance and good songs. It was also the biggest hit in the box-office at the time than any other Disney movie before it. Still, I'm very surprised that the song 'Love' earned an Oscar nomination.As I said, I would like to watch the English dubbed version of this film.",Robin Hood

160,jamaraforbes,Childhood favourite,10,15 July 2015,"Even after all these years, this film is still in my top 5. Excellent songs, excellent plot, excellent ending! When I was little I wore out my VHS copy of this to near death, but I still have it today. The story of Robin Hood has been told time and time again, in live action, theatre, and animation. In my opinion this classic telling of the story is the best by far. There is just something so charming about depicting the characters as animals that makes them more friendly, lovable, and great story tellers themselves. This story always struck me as having that fairytale element and I feel that something like that could never be done justice in live action. Overall it is a story best told by foxes.",Robin Hood

162,boringgirl7,Old but still good!,8,14 March 2006,"I loved this movie as a kid. I knew the lines off by heart, and amazingly, I still do! Watching this movie again as an adult, I can see that there are problems with continuity and animation and the like. However, I noticed that the story is still sweet and funny and romantic. And I still liked it even though it wasn't as song heavy as, say, the Little Mermaid, which is the type of Disney movies I tend to enjoy.I especially noticed the good voice acting, by characters such as Prince John and Robin Hood himself.As long as you don't try to tear this movie apart while watching, or compare it to other versions of Robin Hood, this movie is still very enjoyable and entertaining.",Robin Hood
