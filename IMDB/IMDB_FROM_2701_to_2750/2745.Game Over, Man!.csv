0,nogodnomasters,I'm on a new level,7,1 April 2018,"This is an amusing film with a Die Hard type plot. Instead of an office building, it is a hotel and instead of Bruce Willis, you have three nerdy stooges. The characters worked out very well with some unexpected gags. Used a healthy amount of male sexual organ humor. Guide: F-word. No sex. Male nudity.","Game Over, Man!"
1,kosmasp,But has it started yet?,5,19 June 2018,"Not sure if someone was a big fan of Bill Paxton or how the title came about, but whatever the case, this is a very silly movie. It is so silly, it will either tickle you the right way or the wrong way. It's also very rude and has quite a bit of language to it. Not to forget quite some nudity - mostly male nudity if you're wondering by the way.Whatever you make of this, one of the things it does seem missing is charisma - especially the lead characters, but also the villains. They are very much caricatures, which makes it hard to root for anyone or really be against someone. You may still be able to do so, but generally speaking it could do better in that department ...","Game Over, Man!"
2,Wizard-8,Not terribly funny,3,16 April 2018,"I feel I should first admit that most modern day R-rated comedies are not my cup of tea. It's not that I am a prude (far from it), but I find that more often than not, modern comedians love to present R-rated material in a way that seems more geared to shock rather than actually be FUNNY. If the makers of ""Game Over, Man!"" had been more creative with presenting the R-rated elements, we might have had a winner here. As it is, the movie, while far from the worst comedies I have ever seen, isn't all that funny. It does get a few ingredients right, I admit. The three lead actors, for one thing, do come across as being very likable despite their raunchy actions. Also, I admit the movie keeps moving at a pretty fast clip, so that the movie never once gets boring. And considering that it was made on a lower than average budget, the whole package looks pretty good (though there are minor signs of budget constraints here and there.) But if you really want to see a comic version of ""Die Hard"", I would suggest you seek the French comedy ""La Tour Montparnasse Infernale"" (a.k.a. ""Don't Die Too Hard!""), which may not be too much better that this movie, but DOES have some laughs.","Game Over, Man!"
3,FeastMode,not so good,4,8 March 2021,"While somewhat enjoyable, this movie isn't very funny. i didn't laugh very often. but this is a mixed genre, so it doesn't have to be filled with laughs. but the non-comedy stuff frequently stupid. they also had a bunch of forced messages. poorly-made overall (1 viewing, 3/7/2021)","Game Over, Man!"
4,bowmanblue,Definitely NOT the worst film of its year,7,7 April 2019,"I watched 'Game Over, Man' and I really enjoyed it. No, it certainly wasn't perfect and I'll get on to what I felt let it down. However, it wasn't until I looked it up online in order to review it did I realise just how much hate it was getting, some even going as far as to say that it was the 'worst movie of 2018.' It wasn't.It's about a trio of waiters in a luxury hotel who aren't happy with their lots in life and have been spending their spare time coming up with a new way to play computer games. Then, in a convenient twist of fate, a famous rap star comes to stay in their hotel and agrees to bankroll their prototype. The only problem... terrorists take over the hotel and threaten to kill their new financial backer and it's up to them to defeat the baddies and save their investment.If I had to sum it up, I'd probably say it's like a comedy version of 'Die Hard,' where the heroes are trapped in a confined environment and have to pick off the henchmen one by one before finally going for the head honcho. It's hardly 'high-brow' and there were times, especially at the beginning of the movie, where one of the three central characters got on my nerves as he was too annoying to be believable. The writers did seem to tone down this character as the film went on (or did I just get desensitized to him?) and give him more in the way of laughs than annoying yapping, but what really won me over was the way the writers of the film 'subverted the expectations and conventions of the genre.'For some reason I kept thinking of 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' - a film which certainly divided its fan-base because its creators freely admitted that they wanted to 'subvert' fans' expectations of what they'd get from a 'Star Wars' film. Whereas I'm in the camp that wished 'The Last Jedi' would have just stuck to normal 'Star Wars' tropes and whatever 'subverting' didn't work there, here, in 'Game Over, Man' the way they deliberately do things that you definitely won't expect to turn up in an 'action/hostage-rescue' film really made it stand out among other films of the genre (and generally comedies in general).It's a pretty over-the-top affair and be prepared to suspend your disbelief to truly enjoy it, but if you're a fan of action films and the cliches they normally employ, I think that would stand you in good stead to get a little more out of this film than everyone else. It's no masterpiece, but it's definitely good fun and certainly not the worst film of the year.","Game Over, Man!"
5,Platypuschow,"Game Over, Man!: Puerile.....fun?",5,22 March 2019,"3 housekeepers in a hotel must embrace their inner heroes when terrorists take over the building Nakatomi Plaza styleStarring the obnoxiously annoying Adam Devine and a host of cameo appearances from Steve-O to Donald Faison to Mark Cuban this is a slapstick Hollywood comedy that simply wasn't funny enough.Game Over, Man! could be broken down into three categories.1) The moments that are funny
2) The moments that are too annoying to be funny
3) The moments that are too serious to be funnySadly 2 & 3 combined make up the majority of the film and though there were a few laughs to be had there simply wasn't enough for a feature film.I've always said that Hollywood has lost its way when it comes to comedy. The reason being the formula they use, it's almost as if they are taking drama scripts throwing a few jokes in and calling them comedies. I thought based on the trailer this would be a rare exception and would be wall to wall silliness and jokes but it falls into the same pitfall. I don't want angst I want laughs!Game Over, Man! isn't terrible it just struggles with a patchy script, an undeserving cast and the above Hollywood tropes.The Good:Some laughs to be hadThe Bad:Adam DevineNeedless animal deathNot consistently funny enough","Game Over, Man!"
6,ops-52535,blood spattering fun,9,15 April 2018,"Well seems like netflix have put all inhibitions aside ,and have produced this gutwrenching,lama jama high violent action comedy. its a kinda grimsby brothers film but the violence are really the kind that only war-photographers experience in the battlefield,with blodybombs,headbombs,and lots of shooting,that will satisfy the blood gore loving film viewer.
its a film not for the small children or the faint-hearted,the story are thin but hilarious,the acting just crazy, and allinall a piece worth a view. i will not give it a 10 cause the story is not good enough,but a 9 is given by me cause the originality and mix of sex-love and violence at all levels.
does it sound like a comedy to you....well actually it is, it made me laugh quite a few times,so i can recommend this one.a good productio with a seldom used angle of comedy.","Game Over, Man!"
7,jtindahouse,Workaholics on crack,8,27 March 2018,"I'm a big fan of the tv series 'Workaholics' and 'Game Over, Man!' is just like a feature length episode with an increased budget. So needless to say there was a good chance I was going to love it - and I did. The three leads play almost identical characters to that which they do in the show and I think it was a wise choice to go down that route. Changing it up would be messing with a successful formula for no reason.The movie is simply a whole bunch of fun. It follows a very similar storyline to 'Die Hard' (the movie is very self-aware don't worry) and just takes it down a heavily comedic route. Having said that, it is a very dark film in places. They were clearly given free reign to take things as far as they like and used that freedom to the full extent. In a number of ways I think it would be fair to say this is an even darker film than 'Die Hard'.The film is riddled with cameos and they're all brilliantly executed. The dialogue is incredibly strong and almost no jokes fall flat throughout the run time. If you like 'Workaholics' you are unquestionably going to love this film, and even if you aren't a fan of the show but enjoy comedy I think there's still good chance you'll enjoy because it's different enough.","Game Over, Man!"
8,questl-18592,"The Game is over, Man.",2,29 October 2021,"Stoner Die Hard in a Hotel and I'm just not about it. It's not funny, it's poorly portrayed, it's just not good. Shame too because I think the various actors can be so much better than this.","Game Over, Man!"
9,Kingslaay,"Silly, immature fun",6,28 April 2018,"A movie you can watch with your brain turned off. Quite a few laughs, silly heist, a bit sometimes overdone but overall alright. 6/10","Game Over, Man!"
10,zhyarTheChosen,Solid comedy,8,12 September 2019,"It got one of the best funny moments but some of them are just disgusting, and the story line kinda blow everything up in the end","Game Over, Man!"
11,bettycjung,"Yep. game over, man!",2,30 March 2018,"3/29/18. You got it - Game Over, Man! I couldn't get to the 30-minute mark because the dialogue was so juvenile. Really, find something else to watch, or go for a walk.","Game Over, Man!"
12,phanthinga,Funny but definitely not for everryone,8,12 September 2018,"I can see why people hate Game Over, Man! cause to be honest the movie is a disgusting display of toilet humor and way too violent for it own good but that not a problem for me when I decide to watch the movie purely by accident and it end up make me laugh a lot.It not a waste of time if you only want to watch something off putting and outrageous with a group of friend on a Saturday night then Game Over, Man! maybe do the trick.Also this review is coming from a person who think Baywatch with The Rock is funny and give it a 9 on Imdb so yeah.....","Game Over, Man!"
13,surfisfun,Raunchy/stupid/over the top 3 idiots,7,24 March 2018,"Some gore/genitals nudity/farts joke.
i actually laugh loud many times at the stupidy and violence.
also have some great action moment.
cutting some minutes of some long scenes would help to raise the score(like at the beginning).
i guess more of a Guy movie who like a lot that type of humors.i did a lot!!","Game Over, Man!"
14,nicholls905-280-546911,Interesting failure,4,19 May 2019,"It is tough to bridge comedy and action. Hot Fuzz successfully achieved what Game Over, Man attempts and it was not an easy feat. The team are actually good, it's the craziness of the plot that brings this unstuck. Great cast and some cameos add interesting moments, but in the end the film struggles to maintain humour and story beats.","Game Over, Man!"
15,gibbs-18172,"Yeah, worth a bowl of popcorn",7,12 February 2020,"I've seen a lot of spoof bond type movies. I don't watch Bond Movies in fact only seen 2 I think from start to finish. Back to spoofs, some are great, some are terrible.. This one although not great is definitely on the better side and if it was starting over at a friend's house I'd definitely watch it again.","Game Over, Man!"
16,backup-50362,Man that's high quality garbage,1,19 July 2018,"The high quality is camerawork & throwing money to get minor Instagram celebrities. The garbage is everything else.Cutting a guy's dick off is humor? Yeah that's what we got in this movie, that level of beta male low-iq quasi-humor.Steve-O was in it for 3 seconds which made it slightly better but still, anything out of those 3 seconds was ultimate garbage town.Terrible. Netflix clearly has no standards. You can't just throw money at directors and ""actors"" and call it a movie, which is why alot of movies also have writers. Try it next time.","Game Over, Man!"
17,tesswysko,"Had To Force Myself to Watch, Not Much Good Here",3,12 March 2019,"About the first 15 minutes, I wasn't sure I wanted to complete watching this movie. There was so many gross outs and dry humor added on top of drug culture which doesn't normally bother me but I thought I should mention it here in case it bothers other people, and the fighting between the characters it was just so distracting from the storyline that it made for a horrible story telling all over! But, I took a break and actually went on IMDb and did a little research on the actors and saw that they had done a few guest spots on some of my favorite shows and cartoons and after about a half an hour I went back with the resolve to push through the movie. I firmly believe that it was waste of my time. The movie didn't get a whole lot better. In fact, it got a whole lot worse. There was degradation of women, animal abuse which normally causes me to completely shut off from the movie and end it right there. But at that point you are like two-thirds to three-quarters of the way through the movie so I was hoping that there was some miracle they were going to say it was faked or something. There was also so much in your face gay sex and then sexual partners who they said they had killed coming back to life to avenge their dead partners only to be killed themselves and then the partner comes back to life to avenge their dead partner and it's just ridiculous. I cannot in good conscience recommend this movie. I'd be concerned that a child would watch it thinking that it had something to do with video games because there's quite a few video game movies and honestly this has absolutely nothing to do with video games other than the fact that the stoner and the other friend are in the process of coming up with a suit where someone can control you while you're in that suit. Why would you ever give up control of your body to someone else and let them control you with a video game app? But that's the only thing that has anything to do with video games at all in the whole thing. Now I understand the Link that they're trying to make with Aliens and I think that's really cool but they don't make any Aliens references other than the title, and that's left so open that people think it's a video game movie! So keep this away from your kids for sure! And my second concern is that people who love animals the way I do are going to find the abuse very disturbing I'm sure I'm going to have nightmares tonight and I'm not going to give away a lot but let's say it reminds me of the classic Jack Nicholson The Shining. You'll understand when you see it. And thirdly for just any adult at all, it's a very dry sense of humor and it's not what you expect the movie to be I just plain don't recommend it. So if you're going to watch it good luck.","Game Over, Man!"
18,Mcduff3601,What a stupid movie... Hate to say it but I was entertained.,6,29 December 2018,"This is a cheap low budget stupid movie with 3 guys that I have seen be way funnier in other stuff. But was what I needed at the moment and found myself giggling from time to time.Managed to get a Christmas cold and just needed to watch something shallow funny and thought less and this movie did it.I can't recommend this movie, if I had watched it under different circumstances I might give it a 4 or 5 but it entertained me when I was down so a solid 6. But seriously unless you like dumb movies that you have seen before you probably would be better off rewatching dumb and Dumber.","Game Over, Man!"
19,johnsmithjanuary-20081,you gotta know what you're watching,9,6 August 2021,Reviews should be higher. This is a movie for a specific type of audience. Ultimately it was funny which is all that matters for this type of movie. People are trying too hard to pick it apart.,"Game Over, Man!"
20,Sober-Friend,Funny,7,26 March 2018,"Funny and violent. This film has the cast of ""Workaholics"" but its not the same characters as that show. Here they play three hotel housekeepers that stumble upon a robbery. Very funny but not everyone, These guys know how to get a laugh. Worth watching but be prepared some of the humor is very twisted.","Game Over, Man!"
21,Jared_Andrews,"Raunchy, Violent, Ridiculous, Hilarious",5,31 March 2018,"The guys from Workaholics star in Netflix's version of a hard R action comedy. In this world, the trio still work together, this time as hotel housekeepers. As you would expect, they do their work half-heartedly with plenty of breaks to drink various rooms's leftover champagne, use drugs and discuss inane million-dollar ideas.  One particular evening becomes more interesting than most when a group of criminals show up to take money from a rich celebrity by the name of, the Bae, who happens to be throwing a party at the hotel. The criminals are doing this because the Bae embezzled money from their company. Or his rich father did. Or something. It doesn't really matter. They're criminals. They're here to steal something. You get the idea. It's a funny enough set up, though it's a superficial one. We also see an inappropriate hotel manager, a diligent, eager-to-please female housekeeper and the Bae's crew. They are weakly developed as characters, as is the case with virtually every character outside of the main three. The plot is essentially the same way. One silly action sequence leads to the next without paying much mind to making anyone's actions believable. It's all excusable, since it clearly was not the movie's focus. Everyone and everything is really only here to be funny. But the lack of character development and plot coherence puts a low ceiling on the movie's potential.  Also capping the film's ceiling are the random cameos that served no purpose other than for the audience to say, ""oh, hey it's that guy/that girl!"" They're pretty weak and pointless. Similarly, somewhere along the way, a character awkwardly comes out of the closet. I'm not sure if the moment is meant to be funny or moving, but it's neither.  The movie succeeds in putting funny moments on screen in the way of in-your-face male nudity and plenty of crude sex jokes. It also gives us plenty of comic violence moments, some of which were gross in a funny way and others were just gross in a gross way. Other less hardcore moments of comedy come from the Workaholics trio's charisma. The guys are undeniably funny in many scenes. Those moments make me wish the entire movie dialed itself down a few levels because a tamer version of the movie could have been a better one, and one that's just as funny. Ultimately, audiences should take this movie for what it is. It's zany. It's raunchy. It's fun. If at any point you find yourself dissecting the plot, stop. That will do no good for anyone. Instead, watch this movie through an altered lens. I'm not suggesting that you should definitely take something that alters your perception before watching this movie, but I'm also not suggesting that you definitely should not do that.  In any case, watch this movie for a laugh. Save the drama and intellect for another movie.","Game Over, Man!"
22,clintstevens,Talk About The Dumbing Down Of America.,1,14 May 2018,"This will be short and sweet. If you enjoy vulgarity, used condoms, penises, unfunny jokes, the F word, people and a dog being blown up, and actors embarrassing themselves on screen; then you'll love this movie. All the positive reviews here for this P.O.S. proves how little taste Hollywood and their customers have.","Game Over, Man!"
23,S_Soma,"Great, if torturing and blowing up Chihuahuas is your type of entertainment...",1,23 March 2018,"Everybody has their own personal hangups. For me, it's dogs. I guess I'm just one of those weirdos that likes dogs a lot more than I like people. I'm not an animal rightist or anything like that; it's just dogs.GAME OVER, MAN! is a lowbrow, crude comedy. And I'm okay with that. It was quite a bit more gory than I expected but I suppose a certain amount of violent gore might be viewed as some branch of humor, depending on taste and mentality.So I was more or less enjoying the movie at some lizard-brain level when the plot decided to include torturing and literally blowing up a Chihuahua as part of the ""irreverent, comedy fun"".And that's when I turned it off.For me, there is simply no meta-level of comedy in which torturing and blowing up dogs is funny. When a movie does that and calls it ""funny"", that's it for me.So that's my big contribution for GAME OVER, MAN! Certainly not my best review, but I do wish someone else had mentioned it before I started watching it. I did not need to see that.","Game Over, Man!"
24,snowfre,"Don't expect too many laughs from DeVine, Anderson and Holm this time",3,17 May 2020,"A hostage situation at a hotel is the setting for ""Game Over, Man!"", in which a trio of male housekeepers (DeVine, Holm, and Anderson) need to save the guests' lives. Perhaps an audience consisting of boys in the lower teens will enjoy this movie, for the rest of us, it is remarkably laugh-free and badly written. Except for Aya Cash and Daniel Stern, the cast seem to do the bare minimum from start to finish, and overall ""Game Over, Man!"" feels more like a game lost for the otherwise funny starring/writing trio. There are some funny scenes, but compared to the sensationalist gore humor that falls flat throughout, you'll sit quiet through this movie.","Game Over, Man!"
25,phoenixinvictus,Vulgarity is not synonymous with comedy,1,19 July 2018,"I'm not a moralist when it comes to nudity and I can laugh it off if I think it is funny, but this one of the worst movies I have seen this decade. Since when has misogyny, animal brutality, homosexual relations and drug addition been funny? This was a spoof from Die Hard and Home Alone but at its worst. A dog getting blown up, Adam DeVine exposing his penis, Anders Holm's character twisting in a drug epileptic spasm and the graphic scene of the manager's penis getting cut off was not funny. If this is what passes for comedy in Hollywood these days then we're in for some awful movies.","Game Over, Man!"

27,KyleLicht,It's a fun comedy with some really good gags,6,7 January 2021,"7.6/12If it didn't have some real funny moments, it would've completely fell flat.Essentially, the movie combines ""Die Hard"" with the action survivor/incompetent invincible tropes where they accidentally try to save the day and haplessly fall into good luck that saves them from danger.
Also, the movie celebrates homosexuality so that's cool.","Game Over, Man!"
28,ryanwinning1,Fresh comedy style and delivery for 2018!!,8,16 May 2019,"I loved every minute of Game Over, Man! Two of my favourite types of movies are Die Hard movies and Parody movies so I feel like this movie was hand sculpted specifically to entertain me! Like the writer and director of the movie stood up and looked at me when they were done with their palms up like ""Are you not entertained??"" This movie blew Dwayne Johnson's Skyscraper away as far as a Die Hard plot jacking!I never once over thought this plot and obviously it would probably take a lot more effort to hang on to a wire 20 stories above the ground than they made it look but everything had a fun flow to it. So cool to see Marv the tall sticky bandit from home alone back in a movie again! Penis and fart jokes are right up my alley so this movie stroked my funny bone just right. I hope we get more movies with this type of outlandish humour!","Game Over, Man!"
29,andrewmerritt-31652,The title sums up the movie,1,25 November 2019,"If you take out man then Game Over sums up this movie. Game over Man is a Netflix movie starring Adam Devine, Anders Holm and Blake Anderson. And these three friends who are housekeepers try to get their video game idea to this media mogul, but then terrorists take over the hotel. If you know who these guys are they are the same people from the show Workaholics and that's what this movie is. It's a poor man's version of Workaholics with the same vulgar humor, but this feels like a cheap knockoff. Now I've seen episodes of Workaholics and its not a bad show and I enjoy the characters of Blake, Adam DeMamp and Anders. These are the names of the characters in Workaholics if you didn't know or your curious. But in Game Over Man their names are switched to Alexxx, Darren, and Joel. And it brings up the question why? Why change their names? Why not just stick to the same names in the show? I already know who these guys are so why not say that's it's a sequel to Workaholics. I feel like the producers or whoever was involved making it didn't want to admit that its basically like Workaholics so they created new identities for these characters and said that its not Workaholics even though it clearly is and the humor is also clearly there. The humor is so bad. Every five seconds there's a dick, ball, vagina, any vulgar word you can think of is here and it won't stop to the point it becomes frustrating. And before I finish this review I want to talk about the leader of the terrorists who is so embarrassing and pathetic he would've failed terrorist academy. He does one thing that was cool and then after that the person he holds hostage embarrasses him in front of everybody and he does nothing. Maybe bring back Alan Rickman from the dead so he can show him how its really done. RIP Alan Rickman still can't believe you're gone. But in conclusion everybody stay away from this and go watch Workaholics. Its way better than this and it knows what it is. But like I said the title does sum up the movie so always look on the bright side.","Game Over, Man!"
30,javiergarcon,10 Stars For the best Raunchy award movie ever!,10,15 November 2021,"Honestly people I do not know why you would give it a 1 star! This is not your original movie, it is your disgusting, turn your head, eww.. ""I can't believe I just witness that"" type of movie. Sometimes you just need to rate a movie by how disgusting it is and put it on a shelf with all the other disgusting movies and rate it on who has the best disgusting movie out their or just shut the F*&CK up and move on. Yes I said it! You just need to just Shut the FU^Ck up and not rate this movie if you do not care for it because if you do not understand this type of humor then it is not your type of movie. That is the problem in this world if you do not like something just leave it alone and move on and focus on the things that you do understand, to me I understand this type of comedy and it was hilarious to me. Granted I can never watch this in a movie theater because there are scenes I would have to control by fast forwarding like the Cutting off the Dick part (That was a bit too much for me lol). Seriously the acting was perfect! I really enjoyed the comedy, the action was great (Great job stunt men and women), everyone was amazing in this movie! I have to applaud, Costume department, Props department, Background for choosing outstanding talent, The camera Rig guys and gals did an amazing job on the outside and inside scenes on the High rise, great work, and the lighting department did a great job, Shout out to the sound department! Sound Director never gets noticed and that is because no one ever knows what to say but the sound was spectacular! The poop in her pants OMG disgusting! Yuck it was great! The sound was in my ears and down my throat. Shout out to the producers on all the cuts on this movie that they had to do, great transitioning. Netflix you really need to make a sequel for this movie because these guys deserve it. I really enjoyed the life lessons of how people turn on you so fast and turn into jerks at the last second, (Honestly there is a reason why the bad guy kidnapped the man and wanted to kill his employer and at the end the 3 guys found out why, turns out the employer was a complete jerk after all and deserved it, probably it's going to happen again to him.) then there is the brotherly bonding that never breaks because that lasts forever. To me this was an amazing story and at the end it was a happy ending with a new beginning.","Game Over, Man!"
31,neener3707,"Silly, Bad, But Fun - Classic Workaholics Formula",6,23 March 2018,"Yes its a crappy movie, yes its dumb, yes it wasn't 100% as funny as Workaholics, but its fun, enjoyable, and silly, and for any Workaholics fan, this is good, because its essentially feature length Workaholics episode. The story is basically a spoof of the essential story of Die Hard which is awesome because I'm a big fan of Die Hard and Workaholics, and they actually made a few Die Hard jokes in an early season of the show. So sorry, if you are not a fan of Workaholics, or you were looking for a different formula, then you will be disappointing. But for this fan here, I enjoyed it and had some good laughs, and that is whats important. Whats important in film is that you enjoy yourself, and while this wasn't as outrageously funny as the show, I definitely had some solid laughs and had a goof time viewing this film.I noticed the extremely low Metacritic score, and all I have to say is come on..... This is suppose to be a stupid and silly comedy movie, not a masterpiece of cinema by Fellini or Kubrick. As a Workaholics fan, I enjoyed to see a movie length opportunity for these three guys, and I loved to spoofing of the essential story of Die Hard. It was a fun little movie and if people take it seriously, as if its serious cinema, the of course a critic will hate it, because its not serious, its silly and over the top, and that what I came here for, I did not come here for Gone With The Wind. Over all, this Workaholics fan enjoyed this film which is essentially a Workaholics episode, and I would highly recommend this to any fan of the show.","Game Over, Man!"
32,rigovega,"Fun, bloody, and hardcore",5,16 May 2019,"If certain things would be left out, this movie would actually be better. Like many modern comedies though it seems to rely on shock value for laughs. The fact that the movie is fast paced is definitely a good thing while at the same time it could of worked more if we had a better understanding of the characters. This is a major flaw because we never get to know them or care about them.","Game Over, Man!"

If your idea of seeing Marv from Home Alone's penis and many other random, gratuitous butt and penis shots, you may have found your Citizen Kane. From the first to last scene, this movie is unrelenting with potty humor, genitalia, and frankly terrible jokes. I did not laugh, even once; I cringed multiple times though.I am not a prude but this movie was just nasty. I thought some movies in the last 5 years were going too far, but this made those past movies look like teletubbies. This is not cinema, this is mindless garbage.I mean seriously, this is the best you can put out Netflix? What happened to actually trying to make people laugh with an interesting story arc, complex dialogue, and good dialogue? If Netflix is trying to go head to head with HBO, they just set themselves back a few steps with this garbage.","Game Over, Man!"
35,rajnot,Worst movie,1,3 April 2018,"Cant believe that acting can go that low. what a waste of time and money was put in to make this movie.. how did other reviewer find this movie good,
Unless they are on weed while watching this movie..Pineapple Express on different level.Seth Rogers .. what made to finance this movie man.. Come on guys bring out good scripts..","Game Over, Man!"
36,christosyr,No rate 0,1,6 February 2020,This is the most stupid idea of film I ever seen and I don't know why I bother watch it? Waste of time!,"Game Over, Man!"
37,photoe,"Really Bloody, fairly offensive even for the cynical, slightly entertaining, occasionally funny.",4,4 April 2018,"First off, let me say that I gave this four stars to be sure not to improve this film's rating and I could easily have given it negative stars.Let me start by saying if you don't want to see blood, do not watch this movie. It is insanely bloody and violent. I avoid horror movies like Saw, Nurse 3D etc, and this movie has moments where it is what would once be an X for violence.Impaling, torture, shooting, mutilation are all graphically shown. This is not the action movie with occasional or even generous squibs. This is off the charts violent, so if you don't like that, do not watch this movie. When you see an action movie, you expect some graphic violence. This film is not a comedy with some serious violence like many buddy cop films. This is horror movie level violence.This movie also has some sexism, though it also addresses it. It also has some really casual, unrealistic handling of guns that could give people the wrong idea about how casually guns should be treated. I'm talking these guys actually playfully shoot at each other in an argument in this movie. This is the kind of original scene a movie doesn't need. We already have enough people thinking guns don't do anything in this world.I wanted to like the movie because the three lead characters are all good actors and a strong team, and the lead is indeed a funny, talented comedian.This movie could have been a landmark film if it wasn't so graphic. It wasn't necessary. I think most of the jokes could have been delivered with more left to the imagination. THat's not to say the writing is brilliant. It's a big take off on Die Hard, and it's certainly not as good as that film, and that film wasn't close to how violent this one is, and that's saying something.There's one great cliffhanger scene, some very competent and suspenseful random combat action, etc, but the need to make this a bloody film where you laugh at the carnage is just too much for me, and I can stomach quite a lot in a comedy if the gag is worth it. There's a couple sexualized gags as well that could be offensive both to women and homosexuals. The film treats this in a possibly acceptable way, but maybe not. The point is do the gags deliver more than they take away. I'd say generally not.If they edited this film, and reduced just the blood and gore by 75%, it could be a viable film. It also gets really tiring when 'i'm going to kill you now' becomes the punch line for too many gags. It's just lazy writing.Like I said, there are redeeming aspects to this film. The pacing is fast and good, and it's very professionally made, with a good cast, but the blood factor is just too much. Honestly, this is not a feel good film, and will be yet another example of why Hollywood is seen to be so corrupt. In many ways, this film is an atrocity that tries to hard to be hip as well. Do NOT expect an older person to survive watching this, and it's not for children either, at least, I certainly hope it isn't.","Game Over, Man!"
38,Henry-klein,Seriously Mark Cuban?,1,27 March 2018,Why ruin a good idea with unnecessary sick humor. Whatever respect I had for these actors and Mark Cuban is long gone. Save yourself the pain and watch Caddyshack or Deadpool again.,"Game Over, Man!"
39,mobadizhere,Rip-off of Die Hard,2,11 September 2018,"I love Die Hard, I do not like movies who copy that formula. Game Over man is indeed, a game over. This film relied way too much on crude humor, gay jokes, and other useless things. It actually angered me physically, so obviously, I did not enjoy this movie.","Game Over, Man!"
40,Eric266,Great Fun with a Bunch of Dumb Folks,8,9 July 2018,"Netflix is starting to build quite a stable of quality films that have never played at the theaters. That used to be a red flag when a movie went straight to home video. Now, streaming services are going to put the movie theaters out of business.I've never watched Workaholics, but I'm familiar with the work of the actors. Adam Devine, Anders Holm and Blake Anderson play pot smoking, clueless waiters in a luxury hotel who have an idea for a video game. They plan to sneak pitch the idea to a wealthy Middle Eastern playboy, Bae (Utkarsh Ambudkar) during a late night party. However, the high rise hotel that is taken over by terrorists, ala Die Hard. Neal McDonough plays the terrorist leader, Rhona Mitra is his female assassin, and Daniel Stern is the hotel manager. Along the way, several famous people, actors and comedians show up playing themselves as hostages in the hotel. Joel McHale, Donald Faison, Steve-O, Shaggy, and Mark Cuban are some of the famous faces who show up. The plot is pretty standard fare with the typical gross out jokes and sophomoric humor you would expect from these guys. Somehow, strangely, it works. I laughed my head off through most of the film and there is a kitchen fight scene that had me both groaning and laughing. Shaggy is forced to sing a rendition of his hit, ""It Wasn't Me"" by the terrorists and its hilarious. The terrorists also rig up the hostages with bomb necklaces like in Swordfish with unexpected and sad results. This movie won't make any ""best of"" lists, but it was pretty damn funny. It did a great send up of Die Hard and I was fully expecting Bruce Willis to show up (and disappointed when he didn't.)","Game Over, Man!"
41,garthlotel,Workaholics ageing badly,4,20 April 2018,"I love Workaholics so I assumed I would love this movie, which is basically a long episode of the show.But dang, this movie was terrible. A few reasons why:All three leads are haggard and way too old for this crappe. It looks like they have spent 10 years in Guantanamo Bay being flattened up for slaughter. the jokes are flat, tired and plain unfunnyDaniel Stern (in a career-killing turn as what appears to be a human lizard man with hepatitis and gangrene) literally has his dique cut off, and then we get to watch the severed Schlong flop off, and laying on the ground in a pool of dark dique blood. To make it worse, the severed penois is still fat, even though scientifically that makes no sense. To make everything all the more worse, his dique is cut off by an actress with such grotesquely severe plastic surgery she cannot move her face and her hairline is halfway around her skull. Jillian poops her pants and we get to watch her walk out of a scene with a mega log sticking out of her pants and oozing brown juice from her crack.the cameos suque ugh, everything suques I had to turn it off before it ended. Super disappointed as I cry laughing watching Workaholics and I was really looking forward to watching this.","Game Over, Man!"
42,ghatbkk,"Good concept, terrible execution",3,7 June 2021,The concept of the film is a good one - sort of a modern satire of Die-Hard. The execution is terrible. Just really poor.,"Game Over, Man!"
43,Scarefish,"Lame Movie, Man!",1,10 December 2018,"Game Over, Man! manages to be one of the worst films in the worst year for film ever, and to begin to explain how it goes wrong would be to put more effort into writing than they did. This film manages somehow to feel like a YouTuber's independent movie, managing to be shoddier than The Smosh Movie and more out of touch than F the Prom.The big problem is the comedy. Not only is the humor low-brow, but the bar is set low altogether, and the attempts at macabre and morbid humor fall flat much like they did in The Drawn Together Movie. This is for the same reason, being that there's no conviction in the delivery of edgy jokes though the movie constantly insists it's being more edgy than it actually is. If you're going to go this route, you might as well go full Freddy Got Fingered or Pink Flamingos and at least try to entertain us with an endless onslaught of abhorrent trash rather than just a bit of it and maybe not with a Mormon doing the editing (Note: That was a joke, as in the movie pulled its punches when trying to be offensive). If you're going to comically kill off a dog, you might as well knock its head off and have children play hackysack with it as a bare minimum.I agree with David Ehrlich's review for Indiewire as the only way I truly survived it was by drawing while it was simply on in the background. It is so vacuous that I could not imagine sitting down watching it from start to finish completely uninterrupted. I believe the kind of person who could manage such a Herculean task would be qualified to be a military insurgent.The production quality was there with high-resolution cameras, fancy suits, and competent sets, however the talent simply wasn't there to make such investments of any value. Acting is flat, shot composition is poor at best, and the writing thoroughly lacks wit or charm.If Game Over, Man! were a Rock Band player, it would be the one which somehow managed to fail Polly by Nirvana on drums.","Game Over, Man!"

This movie is what you might expect if you're familiar with their type of comedy. Multiple scenes had me laughing out loud. There are a few scenes (that I won't spoil here) that I felt were just too over the top and unnecessary. There are 3 scenes total that I feel they may have been going for some shock laughs with them but they were just too much to be considered funny. I think the best laughs come from the dialogue rather than the action. Overall, if you like raunchy comedies, don't pass this one up","Game Over, Man!"

It stars Adam Devine (Pitch Perfect), Anders Holm (Workaholics) and Blake Anderson (Workaholics). The only good thing about this film is the chemistry between the 3 leads. They all worked together on the show Workaholics (2011-2017).But overall this film is one of the worst films of the year so far. The direction is standard and the writing especially the jokes are appalling. The jokes if you can even call them jokes, are sickly and disgusting, and there is never any need for them. I chuckled twice at this film which is not what I wanted from a comedy film. A chuckle is not a laugh and I wanted to laugh at this film, the whole point of a comedy film is to make you laugh and NOT CHUCKLE! The characters are uninteresting and pretty rubbish, even the heroes. Which makes it hard to rute for them if you don't like them.

52,mindgem,Much worse than Workaholics,3,13 April 2021,"Workaholics is a TV show starring all three of this movies heroes. The show is good, it's low brow but smart at times and it has an atmosphere.This movie however is just like all Netflix movies, it's super bland, they hire a ton of really bad writers and they have no sense of character development.The movies is just Die Hard straight up, the three bone heads gets caught right in the middle of something bad and have to save the day.So the characters are so bad, why they have to make every single person to be ""funny"" is beyond me. Its so much better to let the heroes be funny and the rest to be straight guys.Now the manager of the hotel is some kind of excentric crazy guy that takes attention for no reason, the rapper is ""super funny"" doing something to take attention, the ""celebrity"" I guess..some guy they mentioned by name as if ppl knew who he was and his only scene was to stuff his face with food and spit it out. Super funny. I don't get it. This is some kinda circus where everyone needs to top eachother to be as unfunny as possible.Since they ripped Die Hard right off, the plot is standard, ramp up til they save the day, that's it. Other than that the movie is so boring you might as well sleep thru the thing.I'm sure Netflix is mostly to blame for this travisty because these three dudes are funny on Workaholics but they did Nothing funny in this movie so I dunno.","Game Over, Man!"

A few minutes later, the bad girl cut the manager's penis...Looks like someone wanted to make a movie, but no good ideas came, so he though about sex and drugs. The problem is that
is not fun at all : they show us a close-up of an used (and half-full) condom...really disgusting !
But it's not enough, the main character got the idea to put this on the face of his friend and take a picture. Yuck !Andy Devine character is so annoying and boring that's impossible to bear him more than a few minutes.After 20 minutes in this dumb movie, I switched it off.

56,TyJustice,Contender for the worst movie of the year.,2,24 March 2018,"The humor comes off as tasteless, lazy and relies far too heavily on shock value than any sort of creative merits. Throughout the movie it comes off as though it wants to take itself relatively seriously as an action comedy, but the boring, static plot left me uninterested and there was no real sense of stakes throughout. If you want to see the lead actors partake in Workaholics like fun, you'll probably be left bored through the large portions of the movie that try too hard to be a reputable action film. The lead characters are boring, unlikable and the only redeeming quality of the movie is Neal McDonough's character for the handful of times he's on screen, but even an actor of his stature had difficulty delivering a compelling performance given the awful script he had to work with.You can probably miss this one unless you're a diehard Workaholics fan, but even then this movie will probably be a waste of your time.","Game Over, Man!"

It is not funny in the slightest. It tries to be funny by being violent, disturbing and sick in general. It's just not amusing in the slightest. The acting is abysmal.

If you're looking for something to watch on a weekend evening (or hell, even a Sunday morning), then you can pick way, way worse movies. The Workaholics guys are hilarious, and Die Hard is a great movie- so you add the two together and you've got Game Over, Man. There's a lot of gay jokes, dick jokes, and graphic violence... but it's done in a good self-depreciating style that the 3 leads pull off. With this movie, like anything else, it's all about your expectations. If you're expecting movie magic, watch something else.

It's got lots of penis-""jokes"", lots of violence (including cutting off the aforementioned) while still being predictable. I was really bored while watching and googled around on the other monitor. I don't like where Netflix is going in general. They seem to fund everything lately.

Adam and Blake are essentially playing the same characters, all the way down to the ambiguously gay character, and on that subject, can we put a moritorium on ambiguously gay characters? They quit being funny 15 years ago. None of the cameos really add anything to the movie. They are pretty much wasted and unfunny. The only one I enjoyed was Jillian Bell's. She can make anything funny, even the tiny amount of screentime she has.The violence was so over the top it quit being funny. They also break one of the cardinal movie sins, never kill a dog. I mean if you do then it absolutely must be funny, and it's really just not. Next time the guys need someone to help tone them down a bit and maybe the result will be better.","Game Over, Man!"

This is a TERRIBLE movie. 
I had high hopes for this movie, great idea to knock off Die Hard with the three slackers being trapped in here by accident.
It just wasn't funny. 
I really don't know what more to write. It was just terrible, the lines where predictable, lazy. Just brutal to watch. 
Instead of have quality writing, funny lines, just show Adam Devine's D**ck. Showing a guy get his D**ck cut off. 
Lazy way of getting laughs, right? Brutal. 
It's ridiculously bad, they had so many things they could use for gags (just taking off off die-hard alone). 
To Summarize.
Absolutely brutal movie, nothing funny, original, just over-the-top gore and male nudity (the new ""extreme"" way) to get a cheap laugh.
Don't waste your time on this one.

Anyone watching this who feels disgusted; do everyone a favor and turn your television off and get on Amazon. Look for the sense of humor section. Try not to get offended by a picture of a whoopee cushion. Now turn off your computer, have a glass of warm milk, and take your high expectations to bed with you.

106,pajtaj,"HORRIBLE, INAPPROPRIATE MOVIE. NETFLIX SHOULD BE ASHAMED",1,14 April 2018,"We watched this movie because we enjoyed ""When We First Met"" which is a Netflix Original Film with Adam Devine. It was a harmless, mildly funny way to spend an evening with my wife. We recommended it to our kids.
So, despite the lackluster ratings, we decided to watch ""Game Over, Man!"" which is another Netflix Original Film by starring Adam Devine. It sounded like a parody of Die Hard. What a mistake!
How can I put this? It is totally inappropriate and extremely offensive. We are not some naive prudes. We watch and enjoy all kinds of movies and usually give the movies the benefit of the doubt. But the violence and nudity in this film that supposed to be funny was not. 
There's a whole scene in this movie that has Adam Devine involved in and GRAPHICALLY PORTRAYING ASPHYXIATION masterbation. Then, in the same scene, Adam Devine jumps around the room nude from the waist down with his p*nis flailing about everywhere. It did not move the story forward in any way. This is just one example of the cr*p that was written into the script.
If Adam Devine wants to be a porn star, let him make porn movies.
If Netflix wants to make porn films, then make sure they are at least the quality of cheesy porn films.
This film was HORRIBLE and a complete waste of time.","Game Over, Man!"

Over the top merging of bathroom humor and comedic gore. While they may not take all the credit for the style and content, I'm sure they had some pull. Will it make the awards circuit? No. But for those that enjoy the aforementioned style of entertainment, if not more extreme, you're in for a good night.

They had no redeeming qualities to them and no arc. However the movie becomes self aware and forcefully throws in a ""I'm sorry guys, let's work together"" moment to check off the box on the necessary film components list. As an audience member, I don't know how you could not be irritated at these characters. Literally they will stop an action scene to do drugs and then act stupid with one another. Adam DeVine's character was the worst of the trio. I don't find him funny in general, but he certainly isn't funny in this role for being self centered, moronic, and a slob.I have no idea what the main plot was or the motives of the villains. Seriously? They couldn't even throw down a simple background or explanation as to why the bad guys were doing what they were set out for?Overall, it's got the horrendous stench of Seth Rogan written all over it, who by the way helped produce this pile of garbage.

160,NoshiSenpai,"If you were a fan of Workaholics, you'll love it.",8,2 April 2018,"I primer this by saying I love Workaholics and crude comedy. It's not a genre for everyone. This movie had everything I had been missing from the Workaholics crew since the series has ended. I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was and take the crude humor of Workaholics a step further. One of the things I really enjoyed was the Mr. McGoo-ish/Three Stooges comedy, I kinda feel like this is a element that largely gone from comedy now days. They also used a fair amount of practical effects which was done pretty well. Overall, it's a mindless comedy with probably not a lot of payoff for the poeple that don't like cruder comedies. I'm rating this a 8/10 because I think the score is way lower than it should be, the movie for what it is, is very funny and well directed.","Game Over, Man!"

178,missikat75,Teen boys will like this,5,11 October 2018,"So I stumbled upon this movie during a bout of Netflix fueled insomnia.
It offered action, violence, some notable actors, comedy...
While I was not impressed with the dialogue... it just feels a little forced and cheesey in spots, it does offer a few laughs. Many of which play heavily on poo-poo and mild sexual references.
If I had asked some preteen boys to write a action movie and to throw in some jokes, puns, I'm pretty sure this would be the same result. The momentum of the movie does carry nicely though, and the special effects are surprisingly good. 
I'm betting heavily that the 10-25 year old male genre will like it. I've seen better and I've definitely seen worse. All-in-all, it's not a complete disappointment.","Game Over, Man!"

181,aj-fory,Lowest common denominator,1,20 January 2020,"Anyone involved in this production should not be allowed to create anything for public consumption ever again. I know this gets bandied round a lot, but this is the worst film I have seen, a true tour de force of hot garbage. It actively tries to be lowbrow and doesn't even hit those heights. It is an insult to anyone watching and an episode in lazy and uninspired, wannabe grossout film-making.Its a comedy with no jokes. There was never a moment even approaching funny. There are multiple naked knob moments, all awful. A quick note for comedic writers - its eye rollingly unfunny to make a knob joke about a knob being small because its cold when said knob is definitely not small. Basically the penile version of r/ihavesex.Every character is absolutely dreadful. The protagonists especially are three of the most irritating, boring and lifeless people I have had to sit through. We've all met and actively avoided people like them in real life, especially Alexxx, a cringe-worthy drone of epic proportions. The stoner element is trite, the coming out and instant transformation of the gay character is hackneyed and borderline offensive. As for the bad guys, the main antagonist has given me hope for making it in Hollywood after all.This is just the sort of films for idiots to say ""its just a silly and stupid film, its fun!"" and ""what did you expect, it's not supposed to be serious!"". Ergh, watch better things. It doesn't give filmmakers free reign to make this kind of trash, completely devoid of charm or any redeeming qualities.To put into perspective, 6 Underground was considerably better than this.","Game Over, Man!"

I actually really love the characters and thought the writing was witty. Daniel Stern was definitely a good sight to be seen. I've only seen a few episodes of Workaholics but I went into watching this knowing the level of silliness to expect. It's good entertainment people. It's meant to be completely gross and stupid.

The preview looked like it would be a good movie. I pitched to the three other people who were going to watch as ""the comedic version of Die Hard"". It was neither. Just about every other word in the script is a swear word, not that I'm a prude by any stretch of the imagination. In fact I have been known to let loose with a string of colorful language from time to time, but even I was sitting there thinking ""too much man."" By the time the movie ended I was the only person still watching, and I almost turned it off when they killed the dog....THEY KILLED A DOG...not cool at all. Netflix owes me an hour and forty one minutes of my life back, or at least a free month for sitting through this cinematic turd. I give it one star because I can't give it anything lower.","Game Over, Man!"

Daddy's home is an example of a terrible comedy with cheesy scenes and has terrible jokes.

Don't expect a cinematic masterpiece, a comedic upheaval of epic proportions, but instead expect fun/cheesy/whatever ""bro"" dialogue on top of, what I would consider, a well cut and directed film.
