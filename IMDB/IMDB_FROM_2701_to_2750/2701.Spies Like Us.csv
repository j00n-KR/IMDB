0,MartinHafer,A new Hope-Crosby Road picture...minus the laughs.,3,9 November 2021,"Two screw-ups, Emmitt and Austin (Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd) are promoted in the State Department....not because of their skills but because they are considered very expendable. The plan is to drop these guys behind enemy lines and when the enemy is busy killing them, the real spies will be able to complete their jobs. They are selected after an incredibly unfunny and stupid scene where they are taking Civil Service tests...tests where they are very, very obviously cheating.Apparently, John Landis was trying to make a modern 'Road Movie'...a reimagined Bob Hope-Bing Crosby film and in some ways he is successful with the film and the plot. But there are two big problems that prevent it from being a successful homage...first, it's not particularly funny and, second, Chevy Chase is pretty obnoxious....leaving Akroyd little to do. It's not a terrible film...more of a time-passer...but certainly not the comedy you would assume it to be. The laughs, sadly, are few and far between. Heck, they're practically non-existent.",Spies Like Us
1,Leofwine_draca,Great comic pairing - why didn't we get more of these two?,6,4 September 2016,"SPIES LIKE US is a likable 1980s comedy that basically consists of Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd goofing around for just over an hour and a half. There's no more or less to it than that, but as a fan of the two actors I was completely fine with the premise. The story brings in a Cold War background and features the two stars as 'decoy' agents parachuted into Asia in order to do battle with the nefarious Russians.I think Chase and Aykroyd are two of the funniest comedians of the era so watching them get the opportunity to team up is a no-brainer for me. Chase plays as always the showier role of the two and peaks earlier with the hilarious exam room set-piece. Aykroyd is slightly more subtle and offers plenty of warm character humour from his nerdy agent. The rambling storyline is basic and episodic but the jokes come thick and fast and there's a good mix of wry and witty one-liners, slapstick humour, and more surreal moments.The film was directed by John Landis who as ever does a good job with it and takes the time to throw in a few film references for the fans, including cameos for Terry Gilliam, Ray Harryhausen, and even Bob Hope. Sam Raimi and Joel Coen are also present in blink-and-you'll-miss-'em parts. The ending is a little contrived but when the overall result is a good-natured comedy with two stars at the top of their game then it's difficult to criticise too much.",Spies Like Us
2,SnoopyStyle,great duo in ridiculous comedy,7,27 November 2015,"Ruby and Keyes have a covert operation to hijack a Soviet nuclear missile launcher. General Sline suggests sending two decoy agents along with the real agents on the mission. Emmett Fitzhume (Chevy Chase) is a womanizing schemer taking the foreign service board exam. Brilliant code-breaker Austin Millbarge (Dan Aykroyd) is working in the basement under a sleazy boss who doesn't tell him about the exam until the last minute. Millbarge joins Fitzhume in his rampant cheating. They are caught and to their surprise, they are brought into the advance program. They are generally incompetent in training and sent to Afganistan. They are picked up by two agents who turn out to be Soviets. They escape and find Dr. Hadley who mistakes them for fellow doctors. Dr. Boyer (Donna Dixon) is part of the medical team working with the Afghan resistance.It is completely stupid as a story. When Bob Hope walks into the tent in the middle of Afghanistan looking for his golf ball, the silly tone is irreversible. This relies on the strengths of Chase and Aykroyd. Chevy Chase acts like an ass and makes this funny. Aykroyd is a great neurotic sidekick without being annoying. They combine for a fun duo.",Spies Like Us
3,mark.waltz,The Spy Who Goosed Me...,3,15 November 2012,"The two Saturday Night Live original cast vets must have thought that their presence alone would save this hideous piece of dreck where the jokes are more out of ""Scooby Doo"" than ""Animal House"". The veteran character actors in the film play their parts totally serious, which works for them, but when they are surrounded by the idiotic foolishness of the two leads, you feel sorry for them, not the leading stars.This isn't the type of film that an audience goes into expecting something that would make Ian Fleming jealous. Dealing with a nuclear bomb hidden in the woods by the Russians (played here with a Boris and Natasaha mentality), the agency that Dan Ackroyd and Chevy Chase work for send them in as decoys so the real spies can find the rocket. But fate intervenes, and these two numbskull's might just be the ones to save the world. But who will save the 100 minutes you waste shaking your head at this idiotic mess? I wasn't expecting a screenplay of Orson Welles proportions, but when you are making a comedy for adults, the jokes need to rise above the mentality of a fifth grader. Even in the popular slob comedies of the early 1980's (""Caddyshack"", ""Stripes"", etc.), there was heart and innocence in the humor, but here it is simple stupidity, and an insult to the audience to even try and buy what the filmmakers are trying to sell. I like the two actors, and fondly remember Donna Dixon from ""Bosom Buddies"", but in the past, they have been given much better material. Sadly, this makes ""The Three Stooges in Outer Space"" look like a genius in comparison.",Spies Like Us
4,gavin6942,Decent Comedy,6,1 August 2016,"Two bumbling government employees (Aykroyd and Chase) think they are American spies, only to discover that they are actually decoys for Nuclear War.""Spies Like Us"" was met with mixed to negative reviews at the time of its 1985 release, though it has since been viewed more favorably and has developed something of a cult following in the years since. I cannot imagine this getting a negative review, though I understand why it might be mixed. This is obviously not the funniest comedy from either Aykroyd or Chase.I suppose the popularity has grown because there is something about 80s comedies that can't be replicated. Some would say a second-rate 80s comedy is better than many since then. Even if Aykroyd and Chase starred in something now (2016), it would come nowhere near the possibility it had then.",Spies Like Us
5,lee_eisenberg,good ol' Cold War comedy,8,20 September 2005,"Comedies like ""Dr. Strangelove"" and ""Spies Like Us"" make one long for the Cold War, when they could actually make such comedies. In the latter, government employees Emmett Fitzhume (Chevy Chase) and Austin Milbarge (Dan Aykroyd) are recruited for something. They think that they're going to be spies, but they're really decoys for some saber-rattling between the US and USSR. They finally have to take action when the threat of a nuclear holocaust becomes real. Chevy Chase does his usual goofy things, and Dan Aykroyd is his usual uptight-but-silly self. There's some interesting guest appearances: Bob Hope chasing his golf ball, and Greg from ""Animal House"" as a very shady character. A great comedy.",Spies Like Us
6,BA_Harrison,Almost as bad as Dragnet.,3,23 March 2020,"Right now, the world's biggest concern is the Covid-19 pandemic; back in the mid-'80s, it was the threat of nuclear attack that had many of us in a stew, with tension between the East and West at its highest since the Cuban missile crisis. With cold-war comedy Spies Like Us, director John Landis attempts to wring a few laughs from this delicate and desperate situation, but the result is about as funny as nuclear fallout: the film's two stars -- Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd -- can be hilarious given decent material to work with, but the gags on this occasion are extremely weak, and the performers' charisma alone isn't enough to save the day.The plot sees two inept secret agents, Emmett Fitz-Hume and Austin Millbarge (Chase and Aykroyd), dropped into Pakistan to carry out a mission, unaware that they are actually decoys intended to attract the enemy's attention while two far more capable operatives carry out the real objective: to locate and disable a Russian ICBM missile. In reality, a select few deranged American top-brass intend to initiate WWIII by launching the missile at their own country, but they don't count on the bravery and sheer luck of their bumbling patsies.Several scenes in Spies Like Us are so desperately unfunny that one can't help but feel embarrassed and just a little sorry for the two stars (even Aykroyd, who co-wrote the screenplay); the pair frequently flounder awkwardly on-screen, as though painfully aware of the futility of trying. An early example of the film's awfulness comes during an exam for aspiring spy candidates in which Chase is given carte blanche to act the fool - I shudder thinking about how unfunny it all is - but the worst moment has the incompetent spies trying to perform an appendix operation on a Pakistani freedom fighter: it's a masterclass in how not to perform comedy. I had more laughs when my own appendix almost ruptured.Of course, a 102 minute film featuring two of the decade's most bankable comedy actors and directed by the man responsible for some of the biggest hits of the day isn't a TOTAL waste of time: we get ONE good gag that sees several doctors repeatedly greeting each other (did this scene inspire Taika Waititi for his 'Heil Hitler' routine in Jojo Rabbit?), Vanessa Angel is incredibly sexy as a member of the Russian rocket crew, there are numerous fun cameos from other film-makers, and.... no, that's everything!3/10.",Spies Like Us

Fans of TV's ""Saturday Night Live"" may never have guessed that one-time rivals Chase and Aykroyd would end up starring in a picture together, or that ""Blues Brothers"" filmmaker John Landis would be directing, however they may be the only audience for this type of slapstick silliness. The script is threadbare, and Landis relies heavily on hammy gags and scenery-chewing.

Hilarious Cold War comedy from John Landis in the tradition of the classic Hope & Crosby 'Road' movies. Despite some swearing and sexy parts (mild by Landis standards), this is a very old school type of comedy. The jokes come from putting two top comedians in funny situations and letting them cut loose. Aykroyd and Chase have perfect chemistry and timing. It's a shame that, unlike Hope & Crosby, they didn't do more than one movie like this. There's a great mix of verbal and physical comedy here. Lots of memorable lines and scenes. Love the music, too.

10,grantss,"A bit hit-and-miss but works, mostly",6,13 May 2016,"A bit hit-and-miss but works, mostly.Two low-level government employees, Emmitt Fitz-Hume (played by Chevy Chase) and Austin Milbarge (Dan Aykroyd), are chosen for a top- secret CIA mission. They are unsuitable as CIA agents but are deliberately chosen for this reason, as their mission is a decoy one and they are expendable. After being fast-tracked through training they are parachuted into Pakistan where all manner of adventures await them.Quite funny at times, but also very silly at times. Plot is pretty basic and some of the sub-plots are plain stupid. However, for the most part, it works. The main reason for this is Chevy Chase. He gets some great lines and delivers them perfectly. Dan Aykroyd is fine as the straight man but it is Chevy Chase that makes the movie watchable.Another positive is the pace of the movie. It is quite frenetic, so even if a scene is a dead end, it is over quickly and we move onto the next scene.

The test scene and the training scenes are the best part of this film.  Dan and Chevy are very funny in these scenes and work well with each other.  After the training though it just isn't the same.  There is a funny scene where they pose as doctors and a few other scenes here and there.  Then there are these long stretches where nothing really happens, and things that don't really seem to belong in a comedy.

There's a host of peripheral stars, like William Prince and the always excellent Bernie Casey, not to mention a cameo by none other than Bob Hope.This is a fun movie and it's great to see Chase and Aykroyd when they were so young, the latter with a quintessential 80's haircut. The best highlights are the awesome globe-spanning locations and the two female co-stars, Donna Dixon and Vanessa Angel, but not enough is done with 'em. The film's just not funny enough and it's hard to believe the producers went to such great expense, but failed to hire writers who knew how to do comedy.

17,lost-in-limbo,We leave national security in your hands.,7,19 July 2009,"This saw the first pairing of comedians Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd (who later appear in 'Caddyshack II and 'Nothing but Trouble') in a John Landis successfully directed espionage/ Cold War comedy. What a choice of three to bring out the laughs, but I never found it to be the laugh riot that I was hoping. In the end it's a randomly transfixing buddy comedy in the vein of a Bob Hope/ Bing Crosby film (which the former has a sudden cameo in) that has two clueless undercover operatives used as foils to distract KGB from the actual operatives with an assignment. Landis loves his self-knowing, referential gags and Chase's dry style feels suitably catered to this, and Aykroyd complements the balance with his light touches. The timing is always on the mark. Plus let's not forget about the cameos of pals in for the fun including Frank Oz, Joel Coen, Sam Raimi, B.B King, Terry Gilliam, Martin Brest, Larry Cohen and Ray Harryhausen. Rounding off the entertaining performances was the beautiful Donna Dixon, larger than life Steve Forest, a sneaky Bruce Davison, slimly Jim Staahl and an attractive Vanessa Angel.The humour ranges from slapstick shtick to comically witty exchanges (Chase's often quick replies) and deadpan acts, as the equipped story is a comedy of errors led by two hapless individuals which would end up saving the day in an unlikely manner. It's a fairly amusing and offbeat concept, as it holds surprises, its fast momentum never lets it sit too long on the one gag. There such a variety to the comic silliness and it goes out on a bang. The crystal clear European locations are exquisitely used in shots, and adds considerably well to the large-scale adventure directed by verve from Landis.Landis would team up again with Chevy Chase a year later to bring us the even better '¡Three Amigos!' that would also star Steve Martin and Martin Short.On a need to know basis good dashing, systematic fun.",Spies Like Us

19,CuriosityKilledShawn,What does KGB stand for?,7,13 February 2010,"I first saw Spies Like Us when I was a kid, when Chevy Chase was my favourite actor. I must have seen it about fifty times since then and I am almost word-perfect on the script. However, I've never owned the DVD since Warner have never released it in its original 1.85:1 aspect ratio. Thankfully it is currently available in HD on the PlayStation network.Emmett Fitz-Hume and Austin Millbarge (Chase and Aykroyd) are two lowly government workers who are suddenly promoted to the elite GLG-20 spy status after they are caught cheating on a test. What they don't know is that they are just decoys to draw heat away from the real spies and are promptly dumped straight into enemy territory.Chase and Aykroyd have great chemistry together and I'm surprised they didn't work together much after this (although they did hook up for The Couch Trip, Caddyshack 2 and Nothing But Trouble). There's loads of fun to had in watching them bumble from one zany situation from the next. And, as this is a Landis film, there are director cameos all over the place. Keep a lookout for Terry Gilliam, Martin Brest, Joel Coen, Sam Raimi etc.Despite the fanbase, Warner have never showed this film any respect or given special treatment of any kind when it comes to the home video market. As I already said, as of yet the only DVD available is the fullscreen version from 1998. Even the HD version I watched was from a very murky print and has terrible sound.

21,The-Sarkologist,A Great Spy Film,8,13 September 2020,"I remember watching one of those rather annoying films where things were just way overboard, and it was really just not all that funny. I can't quite remember the name, which probably had something to do with it just being so bad. However, it was a spy film, and it certainly wasn't this one because I remember watching this one about a week later and really enjoying it. So, I guess it was the reason that I decided that I would watch it again, and honestly, I can understand why I really liked it. This film is actually pretty good.The story goes that there is apparently a leak in the spy training school in the United States and the US military wants to send some spies into the Soviet Union so that they can test out a new weapon. As such, they decide that the best way to do this is to send in some decoys, so they basically grab the two most inept people in the agency, train them for field work, and dump them into the middle of Afghanistan.Look, I probably wouldn't consider them to be inept, since they do have some skills, one of them is a tech whiz, while the other one is a real charmer. It's just that when they get together they sort of don't work all that well. Further, they aren't really all that cut out for field work, though it is interesting how the charmer seems to think that he can skip the test by sleeping with the person who manages the test. Yeah, despite the fact that he is portrayed as being rather inept, he is still pretty cunning.Mind you, the other thing that I thought was pretty good about this film was Chevy Chase and Dan Acykroyd - yeah, they are pretty cool, and I felt that they played their characters quiet well too. Sure, they want to be spies in the field, but they pretty quickly realise that it actually isn't all that fun, especially when they discover that riding a camel and driving a car are two completely different things, especially when the camel decides that it wants to sit down and no longer move. Yeah, I have to admit that that scene was actually pretty cool. Then of course they have to walk into the Soviet Union from Afghanistan, which makes me wonder how long that would actually take them, but then again why let the facts get in the way of a good movie.I guess it is also one of those films that you probably shouldn't think too deep about, but I guess one of the ideas is how sometimes arranging tests for new weapons can end up bringing about the end of the world. In fact, it was probably a good thing that they sent the incompetent ones into the field because it turned out that they saved the day - well, okay, one of them did, the other just seemed to be there for the fun of it, and to create a foil, though he does seem to be the take charge type of guy, but I guess that is just the way Chevy Chase sort of plays things.Mind you, it is fairly dated, particularly with the scene at the end where the two guys go off with each other for a final before the end of the world session. Yeah, back in the day you just didn't think about things like that - it was funny, with three guys and one girl, and you wondering which of the guys was going to get the girl, and it just turned out that two of the guys actually liked men. Yeah, as I said, back in the 80s, that was, well, funny, and unexpected, yet these days it is just part and parcel of the way things are - they are gay, so what. Still, even now, it was somewhat unexpected, but cool, and I guess the funny thing was that we didn't expect them to be gay as opposed to laughing at what was, back then, somewhat of an absurdity.",Spies Like Us

Stars: Dan Aykroyd, Chevy Chase, Donna Dixon, Steve Forrest, William Prince, Tom Hatten, Bernie Casey, Vanessa Angel, Frank Oz and Bob Hope.Let me just start out by saying that I enjoyed this movie to the end. It was not the best comedy ever, but it had some quite funny moments. Chevy and Dan are a good pair in movies, however their choice in films is lacking. After this they do Caddyshack II and Nothing But Trouble, so compared to those two, this is pure genius. I thought John Landis actually did a good job directing this, however Aykroyd did only a sub-par job writing it. As for the back up cast, I thought everyone was great. They played it where everybody other than our two main guys plays the straight man. My favorite scene is one where Chevy Chase tries to cheat on a test by hiding things in his mouth and in his shirt, while test watcher Frank Oz just stares in disbelief.

Fans of these performers will get a kick out of seeing them do their things and, at times, their interplay is simply hilarious. But the film's uneven tone, ranging from semi-serious to complete slapstick, is damaging and makes for a rather silly conclusion.It's basically a series of set pieces that tie the plot together and the funny ones all come in the film's first half; Chase trying to cheat on an exam, the pair disguised as doctors and prepping for surgery are two hilarious scenes.

The story for Spies Like Us was from Aykroyd and Dave Thomas. And directing the feature was John Landis, who had earlier collaborated with Aykroyd on The Blues Brothers. The film is made with some similarity with the Hope/Crosby Road films of the 1940s. Bob Hope even makes a cameo in this film playing a round of golf.Chase and Aykroyd were great in this film, as their roles as Emmet Fitz-Hume and Austin Millbarge, respectively as two spies sent into the heart of the USSR. The sub-plot about rogue military agents is creative and entertaining, even verging on black comedy. And don't forget all the cameos by the future directors like Sam Raimi and Michael Apted.If you enjoy this film, then you'll have to see the 2009 parody/semi-sequel that Family Guy created, called Spies Reminiscent of Us.

In hands of less skilled director it could be a mess , but Landis directs it with confidence and talent. The movie is mostly pure fun , yet the anti-war message is very clear and sounds sincere. ""Spies like us"" deserve to be placed in one line with ""MASH"" and ""Dr. Strangelove"".The movie is kinda uneven . There are moments when the movie goes for too simplistic humor ( the army training ) like if the writers has run out of ideas . Thankfully there are enough really great moments that will make you laugh out loud – the exam , Afghanistan , aliens and Russians . Some jokes are really intelligent – the ""this is non-army satellite"" , the MTV teenagers and exploding TV , the ""negotiations"" between USA and USRR at the end of movie.Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd are in good form and have great chemistry together . They bring a lot of charm into their characters and I have feeling that without them many jokes wouldn't be that funny. Some of the jokes and one liners , especially coming from Chase feel improvised ( the scene with microphones or grenade). I also have to praise lovely Donna Dixon.""Spies like us"" has some nice special effects that look good after all this time. The cold-war subtext might seem outdated for modern audience . The message the movie is sending is still actual today – the common men want to live in peace and don't hate each other . It's the politicians who look for war and they should be careful , because the consequences might be catastrophic.Watch out for famous movie directors in small episodes : Frank Oz (the teacher at exam) , Costa Gavras (one of the Russian policemen) and Terry Gilliam (one of the doctors).

There's just something about movies like this movie, Stripes, Caddyshack, Trading Places and so on that just stand the test of time so well.

35,policy134,Chase's movies already out of steam after Fletch. Aykoryd is merely there.,4,10 February 2006,"They were really funny separately. Chevy Chase kicked off his movie run in partnership with Goldie Hawn in Foul Play which couldn't have been better. Aykroyd was sensational in Trading Places with Eddie Murphy (another SNL alumnus) but this is too much of a good thing. It's not really their fault because they actually work well as a team but the director, John Landis felt that it was more interesting to dwell on the rather tired plot about the possibility of nuclear holocaust which is played out too long at the end of this otherwise amusing comedy. Cold war movies had it's heyday in the 50's but in a comedy that's supposed to be an homage to the ""Road"" movies. Bob Hope makes a cameo spoofing one of his images but it's only good for a mild chuckle.Since 1976 where Chevy Chase broke off his association with SNL there have been many SNL'ers who have tried the same as he did. Bill Murray was one of the most successful although many of his movies have been downright disasters (Eg. The man who knew too little). Where Murray had charisma to burn, Chase comes off very dour and too much of a smart aleck to gain much sympathy for his character, which essentially is the same one in all his movies. Aykroyd can be simply gut-wrenching as he was in Dragnet, but here he is just used as a foil for Chase and not a comic one.To play the sexy object of Chase's affection Aykroyd used his own wife which is kind of masochistic when Aykroyd's character shows no interest in her at all. She's extremely good-looking but that's about it. She was used to better effect in Wayne's World and there her part was much, much smaller. Her partner and she pass themselves off as doctors and the actor who plays him has apparently been in a lot of Python movies and we even get Terry Gilliam as another doctor. These cameos are Landis' favorite thing and he includes them in nearly all of his movies but they are not really there for a reason.So what we are left with is many cheap jokes about camels, since Chase and Aykroyd are dropped in the Middle East, we get lot of innuendos from Chase when trying to bag Aykroyd's wife and finally we get lots and lots of images of rockets in space.

41,RhapsodyReviews,Dissapointing,4,9 September 2019,"Review:
'Spies Like Us' is an American comedy film directed by John Landis. I've wanted to go on a Chevy Chase marathon for a while, I love his work and I think he is very funny. I assumed I would really enjoy everything he did, but this movie was rough. It's disappointing how bad this movie is. I mean you have Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd in the starring roles, John Landis directing and Dan Aykroyd as the writer. I don't know what went wrong, but it went wrong fast.
The movie centers around two wannabe spies, Emmett Fitz-Hume and Austin Millbarge (Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd) who think that they're hired for a top-secret job, when in fact they're decoys for the real spies to get the job done.
The acting in this movie is bad. I'm sorry, there is just no getting around it. Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd are not good actors, but their movies are usually entertaining enough to surpass that. This one didn't have the entertainment value and the bad acting is front and center. It's not just the two leads either, nobody in this movie had a good performance.
I liked some of the jokes that were in this movie, aside from that it's not worth viewing. The story wasn't there, and dialogue is so bland it makes what you're watching boring. The scene I was speaking of before is a torture scene with Chevy Chase. He is brilliant in this situation, and the dialogue is so funny. I don't want to give anything away, but this scene is worth a watch, even if you check it out on YouTube. There is a scene where the two need to test how they react to excessive G-Force and it's fantastic. Unfortunately, throughout the rest of the movie, there was only one other scene where I laughed and that was from Chevy Chase and I will discuss that later. After they are shipped off to their first deployment in Pakistan, they soon find out that they're the decoys in this plan. It happens so quick, and they really don't seem to care. It was a weird scenario. They just find out and are like ""okay, we're going home"", and I was sitting on the couch thinking to myself, ""seriously?"".
Overall, if you like Chevy Chase or Dan Aykroyd I still can't recommend this one, just for the sake of my own integrity. It was a very disappointing experience.

There were a few good lines but Chevy Chase didn't deliver any of them that made me laugh. Ackroyd was acceptable as the straight man so although I'd like to blame CC for the failure to amuse I reckon Landis deserves the blame.

47,CherryBlossomBoy,Comedy school dropouts,3,21 July 2015,"The essence of ""Spies like us"" is best captured in the scene where candidates take the exam for secret service. The two dead-beats, Chase's and Aykroyd's characters, approach it completely unprepared, save for the cheat-sheets and attitude. Their charade is painfully obvious to the exam supervisor, they know it's obvious yet carry on with it to the bitter end. When I saw this flick again, 30 years after I loved it as a kid, I felt like that supervisor: ""Are they for real? Do they really think they can get away with it?"". He wasn't impressed with their attempt at passing the exam, I wasn't impressed with their lazy attempt at comedy.Indeed, the key people involved don't appear they're even trying. There were four screenwriters in this and they still managed to underwrite the script. There are too few jokes, and many of them are just too dumb. Not funny, dumb. Like that whole training sequence, for instance. As if they put in all they had, and it was barely enough so they couldn't afford to throw the rubbish out.Then there are stars of the flick. Chevy Chase goes with his usual devil-may-care routine which is okay when script leaves him something to subvert. When he has nothing to do, he is unfunny. He is just squirming there, like a dog that waits to be taken out for a walk. On the other hand, Dan Aykroyd, who co-wrote the screenplay, acts all too smugly, winking at the audience that he's in on all the jokes. His delivery in the ""doctor... doctor... doctor..."" scene is a perfect example of ruining a gag you're supposed to deliver in a sincere, deadpan fashion. But Aykroyd doesn't want to be perceived as dumb by the audience. That's his problem in other films, too.John Landis topped them all by putting so little effort in the directing, I wonder if he was there at all. In that period his mind was probably more on trying to get cleared of that triple manslaughter charge than on putting together a funny film. Either that or he was too full of himself to care. After all he had so many hits under his belt already, ""Trading Places"" included. Nothing of his talent is visible here. Pedestrian camera angles, shots that could use a lot of trimming and giving too much freedom to principal cast. Many times I felt I was watching outtakes, when camera was left just rolling and nobody yelled ""cut"". Hell, almost every scene with Chase and Aykroyd looked like an outtake. The film plods most of the running time, picking up tempo only towards the end somewhat.All in all, too bad, because the rest of the cast have done their job and the premise had potential. The idea of two wannabe spies sent to USSR to serve as a decoy for two real spies on an important Cold War mission, where the wannabes end up saving the day instead of the pros, works both as a spoof of the genre and as a pure slapstick comedy.

Of course, their dispatch is deliberate, as they are being used as decoys for the real operation, shipped off to be nothing short of glorified target practice for the less than friendly groups over in the Middle East.Aggressively pedestrian, this mid 80s John Landis offering lacks spark, wit or even hard laughs. A shame as Chase and Aykroyd make for a decent team, and the plethora of cameos make for a cute novelty (including a quickie from one of my heroes, Terry Gilliam) for cineasts. It's even directed competently, with nicely varied locations and production values that feel like they belong in a proper spy film: secret bunkers, the arid lands of the Middle East and the snow drenched hills of Russia.However, all of this is null and void if the funnies just ain't coming, and despite Ackroyd having a writing credit, most of this film is other leaden wordplay or poorly timed slapstick that conceptually, should be funny (like a gag involving a jet, or another involving missiles) but somehow, it just doesn't click. Comedy is a really subjective thing, but given the film's lowly reputation, it's obvious I'm not alone here. And when it's not either of those, it's just a retread of old spy film tropes that have already been parodied 1001 times before and far better, and it does nothing new or amusing with them to make the revisit worthwhile.Honestly, beyond the cameos and the odd, rare chuckle, Spies Like Us is a rightfully forgotten title from Landis' extensive catalogue.

John Landis as a director gets worse with every outing after peaking with ""Trading Places"" where Akyroyd's patented anal-retentiveness played well off Eddie Murphy's con-man charm. A better script might have helped, but probably not much. Chase would go on to appear in ""Three Amigos,"" another Landis dud, furthering the career of neither.",Spies Like Us
59,okie-22843,What went wrong?,4,12 July 2020,"With 2 of the funniest comedy powerhouse at the time In this movie, I wanted to love it but the truth is, I didn't. The jokes are forced, the writing is just so-so and the characters are cardboard cutouts of themselves. The script has the movie go to countries just for the heck of it and in the middle, you forget what the leads are supposed to be doing. It sounds cliche but this movie is a jumbled mess that wastes the talent of the stars. A great movie and script could have been written for these 2 funny men but this movie wasn't it!",Spies Like Us

63,lionz85,Dr. strangelove meets hope and crosby,9,23 May 2002,"Spies like us is truly one of the great comedies ever filmed a wonderous pleasure for film goers. The hijinks of chase and ackroyd is truly hilarious and bittersweet. We know they are pawns of the military industrial complex and the overt pressure of the military establishment and we idenify with both their vulnerability and the thankless task of their role as part of the economy subsidization of the u.s. military after ww2 for we also feel the thankless task of our role in the post ww2 build up and cold war hysteria. When we meet up with the Russians we also feel their vulnerabilty and thanklessness for their part in the total reduxtion of socialism to subsidize the military.Spies like us truly ranks as one of the great black comedies of all time. It kind of reminded me of what Dr. strangelove would feel like if it we're a bob hope and bing crosby road movie in cinerama. One laments though that there isnt a big dance and song number, it attains a certain heft but doesnt shine as bright as it could this could have been one of the truly stinging satires of the 1980's trickle down economics of Ayn Rand theory you feel like they should be singing on the way through the adventures. One is reminded of the great Sean Connery singing scenes in Darby o'gill and the little people and on the fiddle. There are so many opprotunies missed but in the end the payoff is high and its one heck of a ride on the way to the ultimate subversion of the military.",Spies Like Us
64,flatworlder,Straight Up Silly,9,25 February 2006,"I bought the DVD of this movie for six dollars. Best deal on a movie I've ever seen. Having been raised in the 90's I missed out on many of those fantastic 80's films. Dan and Chevy really make the movie work. Very few actors could have taken a movie with as little plot as Spies Like Us and turned into a funny soup bowl full of laughs. One more thing, perhaps the funniest scene in any movie happens early on. Where Chevy Chase is cheating on the test...Priceless. If you like over-the-top government action, with hilarious scenes and horrible attempts to hit on beautiful women. You'll love this movie.If not...Then you need to take a moment to look at your life, relax, and just enjoy something every once in a while.",Spies Like Us
65,osmanme,An all time classic,10,8 October 2003,"I remember growing up watching Dan Aykroyd, Chevy Chase, Bill Murray, John Candy, Harold Ramis, etc.  Still to this day they, in their various movies and combinations, provided some of the best comedic moments the cinema has seen.  Spies Like Us unites Aykroyd and Chase in one of my all time favourite films.  They work together (and against each other at times) so well and so naturally. Put this film alongside The Great Outdoors, Ghostbusters, Stripes, Armed and Dangerous, Dragnet, Trading Places, etc and you've got a great day of early to mid-80's comedy.",Spies Like Us
66,sregor,An old school comedy,9,23 June 2001,"This is an old school comedy as I like to call it.  One from the 80's.  It deals with the cold war and espionage.  Two men are sent out as decoys for a military operation, but they think that their assignment is real.  They then of course get involved with the enemy and what not.  Even though it's a typical comedy, it's very funny.  If you like Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd, it's a great movie to see.",Spies Like Us

King, Ray Harryhausen, Frank Oz, Michael Apted, Constantin Costa Gavras, Joel Coen, Sam Raimi, Terry Gilliam -- what were they thinking??? I mean...it's not a HORRIBLE film, and does have some fairly funny moments, but what on earth possessed these otherwise respectable members of the film (or, in the case of Mr. King, blues) community to take one- or two-line roles in an opus which is lackluster at best?Seriously...if anyone has a clue about this -- is there some sort of inside joke I haven't heard or something -- I'd love to know it!Dan Akroyd is not so bad, but I admit to a low tolerance for Chevy Chase when he's as boorish and maladroit as he is here.  It was as if I wanted to apologize to the people mentioned above, whom I admire, for even watching this.Eh.",Spies Like Us
68,universityofhawaii,Great funny movie,7,10 October 2011,"If you don't smile at any point during this movie, your sense of humor is greatly lacking.This movie is set up to make fun of several classics and itself, at the same time. Writers developed the funny and artistic way of getting a couple of out of luck actors to believe they are playing a major gig in delivering the missile. Then they add the classic love and heroism in an actual and understandable form. They comedy routines are timed perfect to keep the plot moving and the film from feeling long. The cast they put together has very familiar faces which the crowd easily recognizes as being funny and know they are going to get a good laugh. Truly and artistic masterpiece and a cult classic.This is a wonderful treasure for a comedy collection and great to see again on the BIG SCREEN. This is certainly one that falls into college cult classic favorites.",Spies Like Us

72,PatriotsReign,Vintage Chevy Chase,8,27 July 2005,"For Chevy Chase fans, this film displays one of his vintage performances---right up there with a couple of his ""Vacation"" films and ""Fletch."" He and Dan Aykroyd form a great comedic duo with great chemistry that will leave you wanting for more.The setting changes rapidly from DC, to Pakistan, to the former Soviet Union. Chase and Aykroyd are identified as expendable Department of State personnel, and therefore trained as covert agent decoys and tasked with an ultra top-secret mission deep inside Soviet territory. The newly appointed agent/spies don't realize they're decoys, but rather, think they're real agents on a real mission. Good stuff.Together, their bumbling antics throughout agent training and their top-secret mission are good for steady laughs from beginning to end, as they find themselves playing the ""accidental hero"" role charged with saving the world.Very scenic locations, some decent special effects (for the mid-80's), and some serious plot-twists amidst the silly humor enables ""Spies Like Us"" to hold the viewer's attention in-between comedic situations.",Spies Like Us

74,darylfant,Father and Son Fun,8,7 April 2019,"I was about 12 when I watched this movie for the first time. I'm sure it was on HBO at my home in the suburbs. I really enjoyed it for the silly humor. Today I'm watching the movie with my 12 year old son. Of course, he didn't want to watch anything that old. Soon he was laughing with me. We paused to talk about Chevy Chase and Dan Akroyd getting their start on Saturday Night Live (he's expressed interest in how that show has been on for so long and how it fights to remain relevant). Chevy Chase remains funny with 12 year old boys. I enjoyed reliving and sharing a moment from my past. There are a lot of comedy elements that hold up well. There are cute little ""of the time"" Easter Eggs like blowing up an MTV satellite, Russian spies looking American by wearing pastel polo shirts and penny loafers, and playing trivial pursuit to divvy up Eastern Europe. We enjoyed it.",Spies Like Us
