0,Leofwine_draca,Too cheesy,4,11 October 2018,"SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE is one of the less well-known slashers of the 1980s and, having just seen it, I can guess why: it's simply not very good. The story is about a bunch of nubile young women stalked by a murderous killer with a massive drill, but if that sounds frightening at all then I can assure you that this is pure cheese instead. Everything is very '80s, and the emphasis is very much on nudity, with long shower-room scenes and girls gratuitously stripping off in their bedrooms while jocks peep on them from outside. The death scenes are quite brief with only acceptable effects. Sadly, the quality of the script is pretty bad, the acting is negligible, and it's all too cheesy to make much impact on the slash-happy viewer.",The Slumberparty Massacre
1,SnoopyStyle,sexploitation slasher horror,4,27 March 2021,"Mass murderer Russ Thorn has escaped and killing again in Venice, California. High school senior Trish is 18 years old. Her parents are away and she's throwing a slumber party.This is T&A with a slasher movie. The acting is very flat. These are not real actors. The girls are there to show off their assets and acting isn't one of them. At best, they are replacement level background actors. The scares aren't that scary. It's mostly T&A sexploitation for teenage boys in a slasher construction. There are no familiar faces and the gore is runny ketchup. Some of this is fun in a campy cult horror way.",The Slumberparty Massacre
2,claudio_carvalho,Weak Slasher - The Killer's Identity Is Known from The Beginning,4,29 April 2015,"After the training of the high school girls' basketball team, a group of players schedule a slumber party. Most of the girls agrees to go to the party. Meanwhile, the serial-killer Russ Thorn (Michael Villela) escapes from prison and comes to the school with a drilling machine in the beginning of his crime spree.""The Slumber Party Massacre"" is a weak slasher, since the killer's identity is known from the beginning and the story is not original. In 1979, Abel Ferrara directed ""The Driller Killer"", where a serial-killer kills his victims with a driller. There are hot girls nude, but they do not save the movie since the story is lame. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""O Massacre"" (""The Massacre"")Note: On 29 June 2020, I saw this film again.",The Slumberparty Massacre
3,gavin6942,What A Really Good -- or Is it Bad -- Slasher Should Be!,7,19 August 2008,"A group of girls decide to throw a slumber party, with no boys allowed, in order to bring back the good old days. Well, that plan is ruined when the boys decide to show up anyhow. And who invited the mass-murdering psychopath with the drill? All he seems to want to do is kill everyone, and that is not nice.I first saw this film at a Chicago film festival, which is the ideal location to see such a picture. I do not think I have ever seen such gratuitous nudity, with cameras making obvious panning shots towards buttocks and breasts, plenty of shower scenes and women changing clothes. Who would have guessed this was directed by a woman? Especially someone who went on to write ""Mystic Pizza""?Not only directed by a woman, but written by known feminist Rita Mae Brown. Of course, we all know she wrote this as a parody and the film was shot with some level of seriousness. Is it what she intended? Probably not. But it makes for a better slasher, with more humor, and the parody aspects are still there in many respects.Indeed, while most of the nudity was scripted, the director says the nudity in the first two or three minutes was a Roger Corman requirement, and not her idea. Jones was given the job after reading only the prologue, not realizing how violent it was or that it was a ripoff of films like ""Friday the 13th"". She was making her directorial debut, and had previously worked as an editor.How much of this film could have been done if people knew they were making ""Slumber Party Massacre"" is unclear. The filmmakers received permission to film in real homes by using the title ""Sleepless Nights"", which was not changed until much later. (The older title is better, but admittedly does not reflect the tone of the film.)What made the festival the ideal location was the jeers from the audience, the hoots and hollers, and the sarcastic cracks from the back of the room. And the laughter, oh the laughter. Things you would have to keep quiet for at a regular theater, you can laugh proudly for here, knowing your neighbor is just as amused by gallows humor as you are.""Slumber Party Massacre"" is little more than an exploitation film featuring 1980s scream queen Brinke Stevens. There is a vague plot, with some vague characters (though trying to tell them apart is pointless). Mostly we have 20-something women playing nude high schoolers and a man with a drill who kills everyone. They do not even try to disguise the face of the killer with a mask or shadows -- this is just pure slaughter. Why does he target this group? Who knows?What made this film amusing -- aside from the sexual innuendo and bad jokes -- was the sheer number of clichés and ""fake-outs"" featured. How many times can you mistake the neighbor for the killer? In this film, many times. And why is he in your garage? If it is not the neighbor causing the girls to jump, it is the boyfriend. Or the cat. Or the maintenance woman. If you are prone to jumping, you will jump -- this sets a new record in fake-outs, blowing away all competitors.Fans of 1980s slashers will devour this like Rosie O'Donnell on a cheesecake. Breasts, buttocks, psycho killer... Maui Wowie... some pre-teen girl (played by an actress actually much older than her character) who is obsessed with Playgirl magazine. There is not an excessive amount of blood or gore (well, okay, the pizza guy has no eyes) but the entertainment value of this far surpasses its predecessors. ""Friday the 13th""? Nothing compared to ""Slumber Party Massacre"".The Scream Factory disc is impressive with a slew of extras. There is a commentary that has Gomer Pyle moderating a discussion with the director and actors, including Brinke Stevens. Other features include a full-length documentary on the film directed by the amazing Jason paul Collum.",The Slumberparty Massacre
4,Woodyanders,A choice chunk of early 80's slasher cheese,10,15 December 2005,"Slasher films were hugely popular in the blood-soaked, cadaver-ridden, horny teenager-populated early 80's, a golden period when all one needed to crank out a horror pic was a bunch of over-aged actors and actresses trying unsuccessfully to palm themselves off as moronic, libidinous adolescents, a steady supply of Kyro syrup, a deadly sharp implement of one kind or another, enough reels of cheap grainy film stock for an 80 minute feature length running time, several thousand bucks, and no discriminating taste or restraint to get in the way of good old fashioned cheap thrill-driven junkbag exploitation movie entertainment. Well, this bluntly titled beauty reigns supreme as the sina qua non of early 80's teen-kill trash, a gory, campy, purposefully cheesy and low-brow zero artistic merit no-brainer howler that goes out of its way to deliver winningly abundant amounts of thoroughly pointless and gratuitous, yet still quite enjoyable sex, violence and nudity with an irresistibly lip-smacking demented gusto. Naturally, the story ain't much, but it nonetheless gets the job done with thrillingly brisk streamlined efficiency: your garden variety leering, sweaty, glassy-eyed lunatic wackjob with completely unsuppressed homicidal tendencies and a lethal portable drill escapes from a local booby hatch and rudely crashes the titular nocturnal bash. In due course beauteous'n'bountiful breasts are frequently bared, the bimbo high school student victims smoke weed, talk about boys, make out, disrobe, scream, and get savagely offed at pleasingly regular 10-15 minute intervals, a few dorky uninvited party crasher dudes also wind up eating it, and in the rousing poolside grand finale the small handful of girls left band together and stand up to the murderous freak. WARNING: Possible *SPOILER* ahead. And boy is the bravura ending a real dilly: the take-no-crap ladies cut off the nutso's drill bit (thereby symbolically castrating the foul fiend!), slice off his left hand, and finally impale the creep on the business end of an upright machete! This wonderfully brazen,perversely ebullient, and wholly ridiculous el scuzzo celluloid swill marked the directorial debut of Amy Jones (who went on to make much more respectable films like ""Love Letters"" and ""Maid to Order"") and was, unbelievably enough, written by renowned feminist author Rita Mae Brown (the title character in ""Educating Rita"" was named after her). Both Steve Parker's lively, polished cinematography and Ralph James' vibrant, propulsive score keep things hoppin' from start to finish. Moreover, the production values are slick and solid, the corpse tally sizes up as an impressive eleven, and the entire feature lasts for a compact, but wildly eventful 77 minutes. Popping up in quick bits are ""Android"" director Aaron Lipstadt as an ill-fated pizza delivery boy, luscious 80's horror scream queen Brinke Stevens (she gets bagged after showing her considerable all in a tasty high school girls' gym locker room shower sequence), and Joe Dante as a nice guy motorcyclist who gives the heroine a ride home from school. (By the way, snippets of Pino Donaggio's gorgeously melodic ""Piranha"" score can be heard on a radio and a scene from ""Hollywood Boulevard"" plays on a TV screen.) Energetically stupid, gleefully shameless, and utterly bereft of any true quality or significance, this choice chunk of 80's slasher cheese rates highly as one of the single most righteously tacky 80's slice'n'dice doozies to ever ooze its way across drive-in and grind-house movie screens back in the day.",The Slumberparty Massacre
5,BA_Harrison,Trashy slasher fun.,7,23 July 2008,"Scriptwriter Rita Mae Brown originally intended The Slumber Party Massacre to be a feminist parody of the misogynistic slasher genre; however, thanks to intervention from the producers and a by-the-numbers treatment from director Amy Jones, there is very little evidence in the finished movie to suggest that this was ever going to be anything but a trashy, sexist, and violent body-count flick. Which is fine by meI hate to over-complicate my horror!Barely two minutes into the film and viewers are treated to the first of many topless scenes, which, as far as I am concerned, is a fairly good indication that a film ain't trying to be too cerebral (sometimes, I just can't be bothered to think!). And sure enough, The Slumber Party Massacre proves to be nothing more than your typical, brainless 80s slasher, with bums, boobs and blood aplenty. In other words, good old-fashioned, unpretentious fun.The thin-as-a-wafer plot sees a promiscuous group of pot smokin' babes stalked and killed by an escaped psycho, and features all of the hokey clichés that one typically associates with such a film, including the virginal goody-goody heroine, her obnoxious younger sibling, a creepy neighbour who provides several scares, a cat leaping out of a cupboard, and a couple of overly-hormonal nerds just ripe for the slaughter.Whilst the killer himself isn't particularly memorable, the fact that he equips himself with one of the largest power-tools in slasher history (Leatherface's chainsaw aside) means that you won't forget him in a hurry: the huge cordless drill that he uses to slaughter teenagers is very impressive (what size Rawlplug fits a hole that size?!?!).After much routine stalk 'n' slash mayhem (plus a whole lot more female nudity), with a fairly impressive body count (but not that much in the way of gore), the film finishes by displaying a touch of the female empowerment that Rita Mae Brown had probably initially hoped for: the survivors attack the killer, with one character symbolically emasculating the lunatic by chopping off the end of his extremely phallic drill.6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.",The Slumberparty Massacre
6,paul_haakonsen,You will be lulled into a deep slumber...,3,5 May 2017,"I do like watching slasher movies, and oddly enough then I never gotten around to watching the ""Slumber Party Massacre"" trilogy. So I thought I would get acquainted with the movies, and thus I sat down to start watching the trilogy.I just only made it through the first movie in the series. And after what I witnessed here in this 1982 movie was enough to deter me from not wanting to sit down and watching the sequels.The storyline in ""Slumber Party Massacre"" seemed to be little more than just random events filmed without a proper red line connecting them, and then the editor was just given all this raw footage and given the task to make a movie out of it. And that was not a successful way of constructing a movie.The writer Rita Mae Brown did not manage to come up with a proper storyline, and that was quite clear throughout the course of these random events shot on film.As for the characters, well let's just say that they were generic, even as slasher movie characters go. Some of the things that these characters did just made absolutely no sense, especially if faced with the mortal danger of a deranged slasher on the prowl.And while we are on the topic of the slasher, then it was a very non-threatening killer that made his rounds in this movie. And even so, the slasher wasn't particularly memorable, especially in comparison to slashers such as Jason, Freddy, Myers, etc.I will say that some of the kills were adequate, although the effects were shoddy and questionable at best. But then again, some of the kills were just downright laughable.All in all, ""Slumber Party Massacre"" turned out to be a less than mediocre slasher movie, and one that I will not return to watch again, and nor will I attempt at watching parts 2 and 3.",The Slumberparty Massacre
7,Quinoa1984,Girl Slasher Power (in more ways than one),7,28 July 2017,"So the first question of course: does the fact that women are behind the writing, directing and (most) producing duties of Slumber Party Massacre change things? Do we get any sort of feminist ""statement"" as if there's always some stamp of femininity that has to come whenever women come near something that (let's be honest though here) is a primarily male-dominated type of film? I have to wonder what might've happened had this come out just a little earlier, when Siskel & Ebert did their infamous ""Women in Danger"" special where they covered every sleazy, misogynistic piece of slasher movie garbage (whether any were of quality, aside from Halloween which, naturally, they praised as not those things, is questionable), since those were all made by hacks looking to score a buck off of women in houses or camps or wherever being slaughtered by total creeps. It's hard to see that those movies being made by men didn't have *some* kind of effect on what we are seeing, but does it suddenly make it kosher if a women is writing/directing a scene where teenage girls (who are really like 30 years old, let's face it) are taking their clothes off as if that's just what girls do around one another (locker room besides)? I think Slumber Party Massacre IS evidence of inclusion in the genre; women, clearly, can make just as tasteless and violent trash as the guys. Roger Corman, who helped produce the film, *was* someone who didn't see genre as any kind of barrier (I remember the first Corman movie I saw was Penelope Spheeris' debut, Suburbia, when I was an adolescent), and while he did ultimately take a script that was originally intended as a satire of slasher movies (by author Rita Mae Brown), there's some of that connective tissue poking fun and, really, revealing the sordid qualities as something to laugh at intentionally. And... sure, there's unintentional laughs as well. Or, to put it more simply, this is a lot of fun, regardless of who made it.One other question: does it have a running theme that makes it stand out from the pack of things that would've wound up on Siskel & Ebert's s***list? In one respect, there's one that's hard not to see: everyone is wrapped up in their own world in this story, to the point where it gets a lot of people killed. Right from the get-go, the first murder that happens in the *school parking lot* (seriously, is no one else around at all, where's Groundskeeper Willie?), the idea is 'well, I don't need to turn back and look', and it makes what could be a movie filled with nasty, unlikeable people and, at least in some part, *about* how people don't help until it's too late. The other key example of this, among some others, is when one of the teenagers (one of the guys, no less) goes over to the house across the street where our quasi-not-really-sorta Laurie Stroud, Trish (Michele Michaels), is watching a horror movie on the TV while her ""younger"" sister is on the phone in another room. Just when Trish goes out to see what all the ""HELP! HELP!"" noise is from outside - hey, why look at it sooner, it's a dumb slumber party she's not been invited to after all - it's too late.Oh, and of course there's the phallic imagery of the drill (one shot in one particular kill scene seems like the quintessential slasher- movie image outside of something from Halloween), though I'm not convinced that is intentionally some sort of comment. It certainly *could* be going that way, and if I find out later on a documentary or audio commentary how it was then I'll eat my words. But one of the things about Slumber Party Massacre to note is how it's clever AND not clever at the same time. There are too many jump scares in the first half (a cat? really?), and yet at the same time there's moments like when the sisters are in the house, one of them opens the fridge and a body is in there - she closes it, but opens it again, both times not seeing it as she's not looking (though we see it from the composition and placement of the frame). I think, ultimately, regardless of gender, the filmmakers know in some part what they were doing throughout this, and it's a movie that gets to (mostly) have its cake and eat it: it's both a shameless rip-off of Halloween while being kind of a tribute to it, poking some fun at the clichés of a killer with... issues stalking girls (and men too, he's not discriminating, he just, as he notes at his villain monologue, finds them... pretty), and the girls in the cast are all game and only a couple of them are genuinely not good, like the ""younger"" sister (seriously, she looks almost as old if not *older* than the older sister!) The climax may try to bite off a little more than it can chew, but by then if one is already in, then it's still an entertaining ride, and whatever that drill is meant to represent - honestly, Ferrara probably meant more symbolically in his Driller Killer than this, on the whole - it's an effective visual.In other words: can women direct and write slashers? Well... duh.",The Slumberparty Massacre
8,BandSAboutMovies,Better than anything that'll come out today!,6,11 December 2018,"I watched Slumber Party Massacre 2 before I saw the first one. I really don't think this interfered with my enjoyment of either of the films as they have only the smallest bits of connectivity. They share drills, murder, mayhem and a character or two. I'm willing to bet I'll feel the same way about the third film and where it fits in.Directed by Amy Holden Jones (who wrote Mystic Pizza, Beethoven and Indecent Proposal, in addition to directing Corvette Summer) and written by Rita Marie Brown as a parody of the slasher genre, this film is but the first of three female directed drill killer starring slasher send-ups.Originally known as Don't Open the Door (the Italian title for The Texas Chainsaw Massacre), this movie is all about Trish Devereaux-Craven (Michelle Michaels, who shows up in Death Wish 4 and New Year's Evil) throwing a slumber party while her parents are out of town. That event takes place just as Russ Thorn, an escaped mass murderer, is out looking for blood and targets for his power drill.Russ kills Linda (Brinke Stevens, thanks for your service) in the shower before the party even begins. Then he comes after the basketball playing party girls - Kim, Jackie and Diane - as well as new girl in school Valerie (Robin Rochelle, Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl-O-Rama) and her little sister Courtney.There are some boys, some mischief and plenty of drilling mayhem, as well as a pizza guy who sacrifices himself and his eyes (alert Fulci!) so that the girls can get their grub on. Russ survives all manner of mayhem and deals it out in kind before succumbing to being beat with a fireplace poker, losing his drill bit and left hand, then falling into a swimming pool and stabbed with his own machete.While originally written from a more feminist and satirical perspective, this was shot as a straight film. It doesn't approach the dizzying lunacy of the sequel, but it's an enjoyable enough waste of your time.",The Slumberparty Massacre
9,Coventry,"That's a BIG tool you have there, Mr. Killer...",6,16 June 2006,"This is a movie from the early 80's and it contains the word ""massacre"" in the title, so you know theumDRILL! Standard, by-the-numbers slasher except that this is supposed to be a feminist slasher! In all honesty, I don't really get it. Portraying dumb but hot-looking girls stalked & killed by a homicidal maniac is a sexist crime, but if this exact same formula is presented by a FEMALE director and a FEMALE scriptwriter, it all of a sudden becomes a parody and/or a feminist statement? The male characters in this movie may be a bit dumber than usual but the teenage beauties are all still defenseless little lambs to the slaughter, so where exactly lays the girl-power element? Oh well, since I absolutely don't wish to receive negative feedback from female readers, I'll just restrict myself to reviewing the actual movie and leave the speculations of possible deeper meanings behind. Talking purely in terms of 80's horror, ""The Slumber Party Massacre"" is a pretty good effort with likable characters, a fair amount of suspense and a handful of excellent gory killings. With her parents away on holiday, a schoolgirl invites her friends for a sleepover party with the usual pizzas, beer and soft drugs. Unfortunately for them, an escaped lunatic with a gigantic power tool still terrorizes the area and he shows up as the party-pooper, drilling holes in everyone whose path he's crossing. The only hope for rescue in the new girl who lives across the street but  oh no  she wasn't invited to the party! The identity and motivations of serial killers are usually kept secret in 80's slashers until the ending (as they're frequently acquaintances of the victims), but you don't have to worry about that in this case. Right from the opening minute, newspapers and radio bulletins loudly announce that a psychopath escaped from the local asylum and he doesn't even bother to wear a silly mask, as he's already carrying the drilling device  which symbolizes a male penis  instead. There's little else you need to know, except that nearly all the girls willingly take their clothes off and that the obligatory after gym-class shower sequence comes early in the movie. Hooray for feminism!",The Slumberparty Massacre

It just happens that the night before, a convicted killer (Michael Villella) escapes from a mental institute. A good quota of slayings, blood, screams and scantily clad young women.

11,hitchcockthelegend,Repugnant.,2,26 October 2013,"Originally intended to be a feminist parody of the slasher formula that was running rife post Halloween, The Slumber Party Massacre was tampered with so as to make a serious horror movie. So how come it's still hilarious then?Plot for what it's worth finds a bunch of teenage girls throwing a slumber party only to get menaced by some psycho with a power drill. Cue an excuse for nudity, tight fitting pants, some gore, a bad actor guy living next door, an awful 80s score that sounds like Harold Faltermeyer belching, and the killer's drill lamely portrayed as a penis extension.Devoid of shocks or suspense, film plays out as some ludicrous exercise in bad amateur dramatics. Even it 1982 the reliance on false scares were getting boorish, while the inability to not hide what is obviously coming around the corner in the next scene is just poor directing from Amy Holden Jones.Generic and predictable tosh that only succeeds in making you treasure the likes of Black Christmas and Halloween even more! 2/10",The Slumberparty Massacre
12,Scarecrow-88,The Slumber Party Massacre,8,30 December 2006,"No big-breasted teen chick is safe when escaped driller killer Russ Thorn crashes your slumber party. The guys aren't safe, either. The film also focuses on two sisters who live across the street from the girls being terrorized. The film shows that these sisters may be the only hope for those being chased and surrounded by the killer. Made by women, I'm guessing they wanted to prove that the females can create a film as luridly exploitive and violent as their male counterparts..and perhaps do it better! They do depend on a LOT of false scares, and the plot is a bit cliché, but there are plenty of gory thrills to keep slasher fans entertained. One thing that is perhaps a draw is that the killer really gets his comeuppance.I'd say it's one of the better slasher films of the early 80's.",The Slumberparty Massacre
13,Hey_Sweden,"""What's the damage?"" ""Six...so far.""",8,8 September 2012,"This is a very simple story here of a group of high school girls having a slumber party (despite looking too old for that sort of thing) while their horny male counterparts goof off and while a degenerate mass murdering creep, Russ Thorn (Michael Villella) stalks both men and women alike with his handy power drill.""The Slumber Party Massacre"" is of course unique for the slasher sub genre for being written and directed by women. Noted feminist writer Rita Mae Brown wrote the screenplay, and Amy Jones, a graduate of the Roger Corman filmmaking school, is the director. Its element of satire may not be readily apparent, but it *is* there. When the movie comes to its now iconic shot of the killer standing astride a cowering victim, with his deadly weapon dangling suggestively between his legs, it does become more apparent that this movie does work as a comment on other slasher films of the era: how they centre on depraved male killers and how their weapon can be viewed as a surrogate penis. Note, too, how most of the male characters are not terribly useful, even if they're not utterly demented: the women will have to learn to fight for their lives if they're going to survive this night.Of course, this delightfully trashy flick does manage to have it both ways, as it's heavily exploitative as well, taking the time (and we do appreciate the movie for this) to stress the ladies' assets in a nice shower scene. Gore effects are also impressively done, and some great and memorable gags are created, like the one with the pizza delivery guy. Clocking in at a very reasonable 77 minutes, ""The Slumber Party Massacre"" is the kind of flick that gets down to business pretty quickly, and in which the prospective viewer won't have to deal with too much in the way of filler. The acting is just what one should expect: adequate at best, although it must be said what a beauty co-star Robin Stille is, as the appealing next-door neighbour Valerie. The film also began a very respectable B movie career for co-star Brinke Stevens, who plays an early victim. Hell, there's a lot of eye candy here, as even an unfortunate telephone repair woman is played by a lovely blonde named Jean Vargas. The music, which is by the brother of director Jones, is some delicious organ based stuff, strongly reminiscent of Bach's ""Toccata and Fugue in D Minor"", and is cheesy and creepy in equal measure.All in all, this is fun stuff if one enjoys the sleazier side of slashers, and it works whether you care about the movies' message or not.Eight out of 10.",The Slumberparty Massacre
14,preppy-3,Didn't like it in 1982 and still don't like it now.,2,7 November 2020,Silly by-the-numbers slasher film. Three teenage girls (all played by actresses obviously in their 20s) decide to have a slumber party. They are attacked by a maniac with a drill.I saw this originally back in 1982 when I was 20. I know Rita Mae Brown wrote the screenplay as a parody of slasher films and thought it might be fun. It wasn't. What I saw was a boring and utterly predictable slasher film with dull nudity and bad gore effects. Atrocious acting didn't help. Seeing it now almost 40 years later my thoughts haven't changed. It gets a 2 for some intentionally funny lines but that's it. You can safely skip this one.,The Slumberparty Massacre

Average slasher.",5,10 September 2005,"The Slumber Party Massacre starts one morning with teenager Trish Devereaux (Michelle Michaels) waking up & finding out on the radio & splashed across the local newspaper that convicted 'mass murderer of 5 Russ Thorn escapes' & is likely to still be in the area. We, the viewer that is, quickly learn that her mum & dad (Anna Patton & Howard Furgason) are going away & Trish will be left home alone. That day while at school Trish invites some of her friends to a slumber party she intends to hold that very night. Elsewhere at school a telephone repair woman named Mary (Jean Vargas) is brutally murdered & her van stolen, a short time later a female student named Linda (Brinke Stevens) is also murdered by the escaped Thorn (Michael Villella). So that night Trish & her invited female friends Kim (Debra Deliso), Diane (Gina Mari as Gina Smika), Jackie (Andree Honore) & a few uninvited male guests Neil (Joseph Alan Johnson), Jeff (David Millbern) & Diane's boyfriend John (Jim Boyce) settle down for some drinking, TV watching & drug taking fun. However it's not long before Thorn kills the pizza boy (Aaron Lipstadt) & sets his sights on our slumber party guests, there only hope is that their neighbours Valerie (Robin Stille) & her sister Courtney (Jennifer Meyers) will discover what's happening & help...Directed by Amy Holden Jones Slumber Party Massacre is as by-the-numbers slasher film as one could hope to find. The script by Rita Mae Brown is as clichéd as just about any slasher film you can think of, everything is here from the sequence when one of the main character's knocks the killer out but then just runs away instead of finishing him off to the usual false scares & practical jokes. There is no mystery element as to who the killer is & you can pretty much guess what's going to happen in the film within the first 5 minutes with the revelation that murderer Thorn has escaped. The character's are one dimensional & your typical cardboard cut-outs that have no personality or common sense, I didn't care for anyone & Valerie does virtually nothing for the entire film except run after her annoying sister before they eventually figure out what's happening next door. I wasn't convinced about the obligatory isolated location either, I mean it's in the middle of a town for starters & there was only on killer so why didn't they just make a run for it? It's not like they were going to get lost or anything & they only had to make it to a house on the street & ask for help, or just stick your damn head out of the window & scream bloody murder! Someone's bound to hear & call the police if just to report you for making too much noise! I know for a fact that I wouldn't barricade myself into a room & just sit there, & what is it with the pizza boys hat? It never falls off even though he has his eyes drilled out, falls over, is dragged along the floor & thrown down a flight of stairs but in spite of this his hat never moves an inch! Having said that it is just a slasher film & it does what it sets out to do reasonably well enough with a pretty impressive body count & thankfully at only 74 minutes long it moves along at a fair pace & doesn't outstay it's welcome. The violence & gore is disappointing, virtually all of the murders are off screen, someone gets a drill through their shoulder & Thorn's inevitable death by the avenging survivors is satisfyingly gory but other than that very little is shown except after the fact dead bodies unfortunately. There is some pleasing nudity too as you would expect including a gratuitous shower scene in the girls locker room at school. Technically the film is OK considering the supposed $250,000 budget, it's professional & well made enough with simple cinematography but the music is terrible. Director Jones fails to create much tension & as a whole there isn't much build up to the murders, The Slumber Party Massacre is a stalk 'n' slash film without much of the stalk. One thing that makes The Slumber Party Massacre somewhat unique amongst slasher films is that it was written & directed by females, unfortunately the end result only proves that women can make horror films as unoriginal as any man. Overall The Slumber Party Massacre is passable entertainment especially for slasher fans but is both far from the best & far from the worst the genre has to offer, average at best.",The Slumberparty Massacre

17,Boba_Fett1138,Nothing too high of quality but it's entertaining enough.,5,4 January 2008,"It uses all of the stereotypes and formulaic genre elements. It's really a slasher movie by the book. It therefor also isn't anything too special or surprising but it honestly could had all been a lot worse.A power drill is a great weapon of choice. Having a power drill killer is great choice for a genre movie such as this one is. It's noisy, big, heavy and not really handy to use. In others words it's like one of the most unlikely items to use for a serial killer but for some reason this also works well in a genre movie. The bigger and the more unlikely, the better and scarier. Also just think about Leatherface and his chainsaw in the The Texas Chainsaw Massacre-movies. Too bad that the killer himself is in this movie quite boring and normal looking.The killer gets on one big and good killing-spree though. There's basically one person dying every 5 minutes. In that regard this movie won't disappoint the genre fans, although the movie is not too heavy on its gore, which might be a disappointing aspect for some.Having some false scares in an horror movie is always a good thing but having too much of them obviously isn't, as this movie proofs. It also takes away a lot of the tension after a while. It doesn't make this the most scary or effective genre movie to watch.The acting is of course obvious below average, which is consistent for these sort of movies. Same obviously goes for the story. It's the sort of movie in which you just know who is going to die next. Splitting up is never a good idea and having sex means you're going to die next. Like I said before, this movie follows all of the slasher 'rules' and doesn't really surprise. The story also just gets plain ridicules at times. None of them seems really scared, even though people are getting killed all around them and despite what's happening all. They even start to worry about food after a while, even though they are trapped in the house and there is a killer somewhere outside, killing them one by one.Quite ridicules all and nothing to great of quality but it's entertaining enough all to watch, especially for the fans of the genre of course.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Slumberparty Massacre

He goes through one after another with a cordless drill equipped with an 18"" auger bit. He does so much killing with this tool I want to know who made the drill battery. I suppose he could've been charging it off camera but I don't think so.These poor excuses for actresses that were hired to be slayed were only good at showing their boobs. This was a movie you'd expect to see late night on ""Skinemax."" This movie about a coed killer was terribly lame. I didn't even get the manufacturer name of the drill.",The Slumberparty Massacre
19,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Great slasher from the early eighties,9,26 October 2020,"With her parents gone for the weekend, a teenager decides to invite her friends over after school for a slumber party, but after a few weird occurrences around the house are revealed to be the work of a serial killer on the loose and stalking them they try to survive the night with help from their next-door neighbor.This is one of the best slashers from the time-period. One of the strongest aspects here is that it has everything that slasher fans need in a good movie even though it features the entire movie taking place in a woman's house with the kills taking place around the house. There are quite a few good kills once they arrive at the party, with one getting their eyes drilled out, another is stabbed in the stomach with a power drill, a slashed neck, and another is decapitated among plenty of others from the generally high body-count on display. Given that this one decides to open up knowing who he is from the beginning and relying on the shock appearance of where he'll come out next. The deaths are seen coming a mile away, but he then switches his aim and picks someone else off that wasn't who the audience thought was the target of the attack which is a great twist. Also enjoyable here is the stand-out attempts to provide stalking and confrontations with the killer. The opening scene through the school, where the student who has to retrieve a book left in her gym locker finds all the doors have been locked upon trying to leave the building and comes across the killer and forcing her to run in a very long chase through the girls' gym is believable since what happens could actually happen to a person if they were chased by a maniac in a building where they knew the location and the maniac didn't. The majority of the scenes around the party work the same way, from knocking off the boyfriends in the garage to the couple leaving for extra food or even the chase over to the neighbors' house where it gets her concerned about the noise across the street also make use of the other fun aspects involved here featuring great kills, a unique setting and great atmosphere. The other bit that works here is the highly enjoyable chasing and stalking that occurs once the girls are aware of the killer at the party, from the early scenes of the girls who will stumble upon a dead body, the special arrival of the delivery person who alerts them to the killers' presence and some of the stalking around the house trying to get away only to inadvertently run into him. The standout sequence of the killer chasing several victims upstairs who escape the killer and barricade themselves inside preventing him from entering, and after waiting for several moments with no apparent evidence that he's there let down their guard only to then switch to her window on the other side of the room showing him entering through the window with the girls completely oblivious to his presence. He gets right up on them before he creaks the floor, alerting them to the fact that he's literally breathing on their necks, forcing them to run. It's a special sequence and really holds this one up overall. There aren't too many flaws with this one. The most obvious issue is that it's far too short. It barely lasts over an hour, and with the end credits it reaches an hour and fifteen minutes. It could've been expanded a little more, with maybe more emphasis on what they are doing at the slumber party. They are there for what seems like a long time, but nothing happens and most of it is split between the party and the neighbors arguing whether her sister should go or not so they needed to bump that up some more and give a more traditional sense of slumber party antics than what we got here. The other issue is the inhumanely unscary killer who's completely non-threatening, running around barely taller than the girls in here and looking like a regular dude who's wearing a Canadian tuxedo, making for a wholly disappointing killer. These are what hold this one down.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Nudity, and Language.",The Slumberparty Massacre

There is friction between some of the guests and the new girl, who is better at basketball than they, so the new girl decides to stay at home. Meanwhile, a murderer with a propensity for power tools has escaped and is at large, and eventually makes his way to the party, where the guests begin experiencing an attrition problem, with only the new girl to help them.......So when the slasher genre was at its high during the early eighties, there were some rife ones released to earn a few bucks, and this was one of the biggest stinkers.It just consists of a man walking around and just happening to be in the right place and the right time to murder a high school student.The film makers must have been having a whale of a time, because the first act consists of the camera focusing on parts of a woman, and nothing else.The second act is none existent, and the third act really just consists of actors running out of select doors screaming and stabbing the killer with various objects.The film is awful, with really bad acting and a silly ending.",The Slumberparty Massacre
21,Wuchakk,Routine early 80's slasher in the Los Angeles burbs,5,13 August 2018,"The original script was written as a parody, but that was changed when production began and it was shot as a serious slasher. Perhaps this explains why I busted out laughing on at least four occasions. The amusing pizza-eating scene and the refrigerator sequence are good examples. Despite this, ""The Slumber Party Massacre"" (1981) IS a serious slasher flick featuring the 'driller killer' and it's pretty well-done. The problem is, there's an unimaginative bluntness to the proceedings and the final act isn't all that compelling (I found my mind wandering a couple of times).The female cast is decent, but not quite as good as in the Friday the 13th movies. Diane (Gina Smika Hunter, aka Gina Mari) is arguably the best, followed by the black chick. The movie is short & sweet at 77 minutes and was shot entirely in Los Angeles with the neighborhood sequences filmed in Venice. GRADE: C",The Slumberparty Massacre
22,The_Void,Moderately enjoyable eighties slasher,6,28 April 2009,"The Slumber Party Massacre is clearly a film made with horny teenage boys in mind. As if the title wasn't a big enough clue on its own; the fact that most of the cast are young girls, and most of them spend the majority of the movie in their underwear, means that the film is obviously pandering to a certain group of people. Like most eighties slashers; the film is not very original, and actually manages to take in even more clichés than usual...but despite that, there are worse ways to spend seventy five minutes; and this film is among the upper half of eighties slashers (though that says a lot about the competition!). Anyway, the film takes place around a high school; and one of the girls is planning to have a slumber party while her parents are away. She invites her closest friends; but not the 'new girl' (who happens to live just across the street) because some of the girls are jealous of her good looks and basketball skills. Around the same time, a murderer has escaped and is on the loose along with his trusty power tool; and naturally it's not long before these two often-seen plot threads are tied together by way of the killer slaughtering the girls.Some slashers add an extra element of interest by not letting the audience know who the killer is until the end. There's no such inventiveness here, however; and we are shown the killer right from the start. There's nothing distinguishing about him either; he's simply an escaped lunatic with a great big drill. So of course you would be expecting the film to make up for this with inventive kills, suspenseful plotting and interesting characters...but no such luck. The fact that the film is more interested in showing flesh than anything is made obvious throughout; although the director is at least good enough to ensure that all the girls are nice to look at. Most people will be going into this film hoping to see some gory kills; although in spite of the fact that the killer brandishes a really big drill; there's actually not a lot of blood on display. Most of the kill scenes cut away before any blood is shown...which is disappointing. Still, in spite of the flaws; The Slumber Party Massacre is decent lightweight viewing that doesn't outstay its welcome.",The Slumberparty Massacre

Their plans include beer, weed, and pizza. Plans are interrupted, however, by an escaped mental patient with a very large power drill that he enjoys plunging into his victims. Girls in pajamas (or less) and a deranged killer - sounds like a good mix.I never realized the screenplay for Slumber Party Massacre was written by novelist Rita Mae Brown. Over the years, I've enjoyed her Mrs Murphy mystery series. I've read that she originally intended the movie to be a parody of the slasher genre, but the producers went ahead and made it a more serious movie. There's still a lot of humor in the film that I find quite funny - the refrigerator door scene near the end being one example. Also, knowing that this was originally meant to be a parody, it helps explain a lot to me about the killer and the rest of the movie. On his own, Russ Thorn is not very frightening - just odd. Some of his facial expressions in the finale are priceless. I haven't read through all the comments on IMDb, so I'm sure this has been endlessly written about, but exactly what kind of power source was he using with that drill? There was no power cord and I've never seen a battery powered drill that can maintain that much power for that length of time. It must have been one of those nuclear drills so popular in the early 80s. The giant drill also makes for a very unwieldy, noisy weapon. Not the weapon of choice when sneaking up on people. I'll bet this was most likely a leftover irony from the original script.Since its release, I think I've now seen Slumber Party Massacre three times. I enjoyed it much more this time, but still can't rate it higher than a 5/10. I think that had they gone ahead and made this a full- on parody, it would have been a much better movie.",The Slumberparty Massacre
27,sol1218,Drilling Home a Point.,6,22 August 2005,"(Some Spoilers) One of the better slashers movies of the 1980's that gets right to the point even before the opening credits stop rolling. Escaping from prison where he's been incarcerated since 1969 Russ Thorn,Michael Villella, doesn't take long to start on his murderous campaign against society by drilling to death a telephone repair worker, Jean Vargas, and then using her company van to make his getaway.Already having murdered five people for which he was given a life sentence the on the loose Thorn is out to make up for all the lost time that he spent behind bars. Thorn using a power-drill ends up boring to death some ten persons, as well as some members of the audience, before his reign of terror is over. ""Slumber Party Massacre"" is a lot better then you would have expected it to be with the tension and action nicely paced. Thron goes from victims to victim from one part of Tris Devereaud's,Michelle Michaels,house to another as he slowly knocks them off one person at a time until the final scene.Thorn is confronted at the end of ""Slumber Party Massacre"" by Trish together with Val and her kid sister Courtney, Robin Stille & Jenifer Meyers, and the girl's high-school coach Carpenter, Pamala Gazano,who all turned out to be more that a match for the insane killer. Like most, if not all, of these movie slasher psychos Thorn seems to have supernatural powers and no matter how much punishment he takes Thorn still comes back for more. Even when he has both his hands sliced and chopped off as well as run through with a machete and then thrown into a swimming pool where he's left to both drown and bleed to death.The acting in the film isn't anything to write home about with the girls trapped in the house by Thorn about as convincing, in trying to show any kind of fear and terror toward him, as if they found to their shock and horror that the hot and sizzling pizza that they ordered ice cold. In fact in one of the scenes after the local pizza delivery boy, Aaron Lipstadt, gets killed by Thorn they act so shrill and phony that for a moment you thought that it, the delivery boys death, was some kind of prank played on them by their boyfriends. They act more realistic and show more emotion eating slices of the pizza that he delivered then they did when he was murdered right in front of their eyes.You have to give the acting credits in the movie to Michael Villella as the psycho/driller/killer who uses his power drill as if it were an extension of his own libido. He's even photographed in some of his scenes with his power drill pointing menacingly between his legs ,geared up and ready. It's as if he's about to drill, or screw, to death his mostly female victims. Thorn looked like he was far more hurt when his precious power drill had it's point chopped off by Valerie then when she sliced him up like a piece of swiss cheese. Thorn who didn't say a single word during almost the entire movie did open his mouth finally at the end. You could see why the director was wise enough to have him keep his mouth shut for as long as he did. He was a lot more effective when he let his drill do the talking for him.",The Slumberparty Massacre
28,lost-in-limbo,Drill Happy.,7,24 February 2009,"Why is this slasher more accommodating and entertaining than most of its kind? This question seemed to be running through my head. It is because it brought across leering sleaze (like that long shower scene with constantly intrusive camera-work) and brutal violence with a healthy body count I guess. But as slashers go, it delivered on what seems to count and the execution was always spot on. I wouldn't call it great and it's quite routine as they go, but 'Slumber Party Massacre' holds a maniac edge and competent air that easily makes it one of the sub-genres' best and funniest to view.Brimming with attitude and energy (thanks to Amy Holden Jones' efficiently upbeat and gusty direction and an effectively foreboding electronic score), it pretty much gets right into it and never really let's go. As suspense is well placed and shaped (with a certain nightmarish intensity and nastiness), as the pace goes straight for jugular with the running time being quite short (75 minutes). What we have is an escaped loony killer (with no motive) who randomly decides to terrorise some girls at a sleepover. Talk about being at the wrong place at the wrong time. The material plays with the conventional clichés and exaggeratedly draws them up with a rather humorous tongue even the visuals are obvious (like the organism weapon of choice). The usual teenage banter provides realism and the performances are wholesomely brought across. Robin Stille and Michele Michaels are sound in their roles. Plus you got an early, but memorable part by Brinke Stevens.Silly and seamy, but likable 80s stalk n' slash exploitation fare.",The Slumberparty Massacre
29,Pjtaylor-96-138044,You know the drill.,5,13 October 2021,"'The Slumber Party Massacre (1982)' is, essentially, a nuts-and-bolts slasher. Originally written as a parody of such pictures (then titled 'Sleepless Nights'), the piece was altered slightly when infamous producer Roger Corman got hold of it; he and producer-director Amy Holden Jones shot the script unironically, changing the title in the process. It's unclear whether further changes were made to the material, but what is clear is that the end result feels as though it's having a bit of an identity crisis. Because it's shot unironically, the script's subtle satire barely comes through. However, because the script is satirical, the affair doesn't really work as 'straight horror'. Basically, the purposefully trope-laden nature of the screenplay leads the end result to accidentally feel incredibly generic; it isn't using its tried-and-tested nature as a way to comment on the genre, so it feels as though it's derivative simply for the sake of it. It's difficult to explain. Essentially, the conflict between script and execution is incredibly detrimental to the overall experience. It's a bit odd that this is the case, too, as strong satire should still shine through an unironic presentation; perhaps the original script wasn't that good to begin with? I haven't read it so I can't say that's the case, but the flick does make you wonder. Anyway, regardless of its initial intentions, the film is a generic, generally uninspired slasher that sees a maniac assault a group of teens with a power drill. It has a few well-directed suspense sequences and some relatively convincing kills. It's also generally entertaining in a passive sort of way. However, it's just a bit dull and uninteresting overall. It has its highlights, don't get me wrong. It isn't a bad film, but it isn't particularly good, either. It's alright. 5/10.",The Slumberparty Massacre
30,bowmanblue,How low can it go?,6,31 October 2020,"If you've ever watched a 'slasher' film in the nineties and beyond, then you'll probably know the cliches and tropes that are associated with the genre. In fact, many films (post 'Scream' era) have gone out of their way to point out such cliches and made fun of them in their own films. If you've ever wondered, 'But where did all these tropes originate from?' then 'The Slumber Party Massacre' may just answer your question.You all know what a 'slasher' film is: a killer stalks and murders a selection of people in various gruesome ways. Here, a teenage girl decides to have - you guessed it - a slumber party with her friends while her parents are away. Unfortunately, a nutter with a drill arrives to gatecrash it. There's nothing particularly original about the plot, but that's not why people watch these sorts of films. If they're halfway entertaining then the audience will normally give the story a pass. However, there are so many bizarre decisions here that by about the halfway mark I was seriously wondering whether I was watching an early form of parody of the genre.Where do I begin? The film has numerous pointless shots of female nudity, the camera panning down the actresses' bodies in order to highlight their, er, 'physique.' If you're expecting a script which leaves you guessing as to who the killer is then think again. The killer is revealed in about the opening ten minutes. Normally, the antagonist has some sort of gimmick, i.e. a face made out of his victims' skin, an ice hockey mask, a ghost-face mask etc. Not here. Here we have a killer who basically looks like an average man and wears 'double denim.'The characters. Um, well, they're young women - mainly brunettes. In fact, most are so interchangeable that you'll be confused as to which one has just been drilled to death. Naturally, they're all roughly in their thirties while playing teenagers, which is odd to say the least.The gore: there's not that much. I know the film was made on a shoestring, but I've seen plenty of low budget films that make the most out of what they have and can pull off some pretty impressive practical effects. Not here. You get a few bl00dy stab wounds, but nothing you haven't seen before.I have to say that I was hoping for something more from this film. It's just the film that was the basis for all the slasher parodies which followed. The characters make absolutely random decisions which will leave you shaking your head. It's watchable, but only because you'll be curious as to just how bad it gets. Oh, and it's short, so you don't really feel like you've wasted too much of your time on this. Probably shocking for its day, but now just one of so many similar films in the genre.",The Slumberparty Massacre

This moves as slow as molasses! I can't believe all the positive reviews for this movie! I respect opinions, but did we watch the same movie? To make things even worse, there isn't much gore in this movie either. Those are two of your main ingredients when it comes to making a slasher movie, fun & gore. The drill attacks aren't anything special...nor is the killer himself. The 80's are responsible for some of my favorite slashers, but it's also responsible for some awful stinkers.

32,Floated2,Bland slasher film with silly characters,2,8 January 2021,"Didn't expect much from this 1982 slasher film. It is as expected as there were kills but nothing too gory and nothing very interesting either. Very bland and generic kills, with the villain using a power drill. Many of the camera shots of the kills didn't show too much as it was somewhat tame, although it was bloody. The film lacked any atmosphere or tone.First the characters of the young women lacked sense. For instance in a scene where the villain approach two women in their bedroom. One of the woman attacks him knocking him unconscious with a bat for a brief second, yet they both decide to try and leave the room instead of continue to attacking or killing the villain. Then another scene where the woman coach is standstill with the villain with a weapon in her hand, we see one of the characters stay hiding under the couch, instead of coming out with a weapon and helping the coach to kill the villain, she waits until it is too late- ultimately allowing the villain to kill the coach.Overall the film is very cheap, lacks any real atmosphere, tone or suspense. No real jump scares. Not very funny or comedic as initially thought to be, but the acting isn't great so it's not to be taken serious.Featuring a very bland and generic looking villain that serves no purpose (doesn't mention why he chose this group of women to kill). With an ending that is ultimately predictable (with the villain being killed). Thankfully the film is quite short. Overall, this film is nearing 40 years old and it shows.",The Slumberparty Massacre

I can't help but stop being reminded of the 2014 GEICO insurance commercial ""Let's Hide Behind the Chainsaws - Geico"" whenever I watch one of these dated 1980's chick flick horror films.This particular one is entertaining and great viewing for teenagers unfamiliar with the Slumber Party Massacre trilogy of 1982, 1987 and 1990.

36,BaronBl00d,California Girls & a Psycho Meet,4,6 February 2005,"One gets exactly what one is promised in this somewhat low-budget slasher film that would go on to spawn at least a couple sequels. The film's premise is about a group of girls & company(voyeuristic boys, a neighbor, a basketball coach, etc...)spending an evening together for a slumber party only to have things go awry when an escaped serial killer with a penchant for drilling people to death comes onto the scene. This film has two points to make primarily: one, kill as many people as possible in the most unnatural ways possible and two, mix as much senseless nudity, sexual innuendo, and sophomoric humour into the film without turning it to a comedy rather than a slasher flick. Well, Slumber Party Massacre is fairly successful on both counts. There are a lot of murders, particularly with characters that are not characters(pizza guy?). The film is fairly gory but not hyperbolic by any means. I was more disturbed by the screenwriter's lack of humanity and the director's lack of good taste and sense more than what I saw on screen. One can make a film like this and create characters we care about and place some value on life. When one character dies after another in some weird way, the audience becomes removed from what is going on in the film and what is going on in the film becomes something distant. OK, enough of my sermonizing on the need of directors, writers, and audiences putting a little more value into human existence. As for the film, it is not a good one ,but it is not real bad either. I have seen far worse. The actors and actresses, despite the ridiculous lines that must utter, are efficient. The girls too are lovely to look at.

Revisited it recently.High school girls r targetted on a slumber party by a maniac with a power drill.Our psycho ain't a big built or scary looking guy but jus an ordinary fella with a very bad sense of dressing, he wears a dark blue denim jacket, on a red tshirt with dark blue jeans n black cowboy boots.His power drill machine is heavier than him but unfortunately our teens cannot put up a fight against him inspite of being large in nos.Forget about putting up a fight, a young guy keeps knocking on the door rather than jus running away from the old killer. Our teen wud have definitely outrunned the puny killer.In another scene a stupid fella without uttering a word lays outside a door n when the killer kills him, he screams.The film has the same cliches which has been endured by horror fans umpteenth no of times. A person hits the killer, the killer falls on the ground unconscious n rather than hitting the killer repeatedly while he is unconscious n down, people run away.Marcus Dunstan's The Neighbour is a good example of a thriller without the usual cliches.Now coming to some good points, the film has lots of nudity. In one scene a camera lingers on boobs n butt. It has a hot babe in a chemise exposing large cleavage.The film does get a bit violent towards the end with some stabbings n slashings.",The Slumberparty Massacre
38,Anonymous_Maxine,"""Wait! I think I hear someone! I better go play the piano""",1,18 December 2003,"The above is not a direct quote, but a quote of the action. At one point, one of the girls is home alone, talking on the phone, and tells the person on the phone that she has to go because she thinks she hears someone. She hangs up the phone and walks immediately over to the piano and starts playing. Now, I normally reserve my votes of one out of ten for movies that are absolutely incomprehensible on any level. Slumber Party Massacre has a definitely decipherable plot, but the plot is nothing but a flimsy clothesline along which are staged a lot of cheap thrills and boring murder scenes.And, ironically enough, even in the case of a movie that is obviously driven by nudity (of which the film features remarkably little), I don't mean cheap thrills as far as shower scenes or lingerie scenes or any weak trash like that. You have the screeching cat scare, half a dozen or so friends sneaking up on people and viciously grabbing their shoulder from behind or something, only to throw up their hands like, What? What? I scared you? Each successive one making this movie more and more of an endurance test than the weak horror, awful acting, or abysmal script-writing could ever do.
And who's the killer? No one. Some tool in cowboy boots and a lot of denim. Evidently he's an escaped mass murderer who went on a killing spree in the late 60s, which I guess would explain why he appears to be nothing but a middle-aged man with graying hair and a three foot drill. It's like they picked some jerk off the street and said Hey, hold this drill and let us film you running around this locker room for a little while. That should be good enough for this movie. I love all of the attempts to impose some deep women's lib meaning into this movie by commenting on the obviously phallic drill that this jean-jacket-clad maniac chases these women around with. Not that there's anything wrong with the women's liberation movement or implying that a film like this has any meaning in regards to the plight of women, I just think it's really funny to inject meaning into a film as meaningless as this one.
(spoilers) There's one scene at the end of the film where there is a weak attempt to suggest the insanity of the killer as he mumbles his total of I think 21 spoken words (not including the gibberish he screams after he gets his hand cut off), the first few of which are, ""You're all so pretty,"" and, shockingly enough, ""I love you."" Very cute, it's too bad this sudden moment of character depth comes so far out of left field that it is memorable simply because of its separation with the rest of the film than any meaning it might carry. Joseph Ulibas (my neighbor right over in Sacramento) makes an interesting comment that Freud would have loved to psychoanalyze the killer in this movie. Sure, this last scene definitely implies some serious sexual anxiety, as this is apparently a man who gets his thrills by killing pretty women that he loves, but to be perfectly honest, I think Freud would have more of a field day analyzing the writers and, at least as much, whoever it was that read the script and decided that this would be a good movie.",The Slumberparty Massacre

The provenance of this this woman-helmed T and A (t*ts and assassins) slasher classic is entertaining. Briefly, the original treatment was a parody by feminist author Rita Mae Brown that the producers decided to make as a real slasher film but left in some of the comedy elements (such as the body in the refrigerator). All the elements of a slasher/horror are present but the drill-wielding maniac is not a particularly memorable psycho (although his phallic weapon of choice is). The female cast (clearly overage for 'high school' girls) is fine for what is expected of them (screams and skin) but the two guys who lurk around the titular party to leer and die are pretty amateurish. The requisite gore in an '80s 18+ splatter opus is not too over-the-top and the story, although a bit repetitious, moves briskly to its 74 minute sanguineous climax. Good fun for fans (both of camp and of gore). An added bonus: the gratuitous nudity is front-loaded (excuse the pun), negating the need for tedious fast-forwarding to find it.",The Slumberparty Massacre

Not really, it was just an excuse for nudity and undies.But, you already knew all of that when you sat down to watch this.

45,robfollower,The camera gets a case of the wandering eyes.......,8,16 October 2019,"A high school student's slumber party turns terrifying as an escaped mental patient with a drill decides to crash the evening.You don't get a good look at the killer until the movie is more than half over. This is good, because once you do see him, you lose all respect for the people that are running and hiding from him. He's about five foot two and moves so slowly with his stupid drill that any reasonably fit person (including all of the athletic women he is stalking) could easily dodge that spinning drill bit and kick the crap out of him. He is the least scary killer in slasher movie history.We see our first boob about 43 seconds in, and thereafter we see an average of a pair every ten minutes. Like almost all slasher movies, it has its share of gratuitous nudity, but there is one example that had me laughing out loud. In the shower scene early on, we see the head and shoulders of one girl from behind as she stands in the spray, talking to the girl next to her. The camera gets a case of the wandering eyes and pans down slowly to show a shot of her butt that lasts for a few seconds. Hay , The Slumber Party Massacre was ""written and directed by women"". I say more power to them .While it provides the requisite nude scenes and gory murders, it did not put me to sleep in between the exploitation. So yeah.

46,drownnnsoda,"""You're all really pretty""",8,3 February 2017,"""The Slumber Party Massacre"" focuses on a group of teenagers in suburban Los Angeles who are having a get-together over the weekend while their parents are away. Lo and behold, a maniac with an electric drill of all things has been lurking around the high school, and has followed them home to join the party.This fast and easy slasher flick was originally written as a feminist satire of slasher movies by Rita Mae Brown, but was directed by Amy Holden Jones as a more or less straightforward horror film, and it certainly reads that way. Though it's dotted with bits of slight humor, ""The Slumber Party Massacre"" actually feels fairly dark for a slasher movie. Cribbing ""Halloween"" in set-up and ""Texas Chainsaw"" in title, the film manages to achieve a somber and weirdly unsettling tone from early on. Part of it has to do with the dampened, shadowy cinematography that manages to make even sunny Southern California a dark place, and part of it is the sheer arbitrariness of it all. The killer's arrival is given no context or back story, not dissimilar from 1980's ""Final Exam.""At 77 minutes, the film is brisk, but it manages to deliver on just about all accounts. There is ample gore that is surprisingly well done, and there are some unique, extremely eerie shots in which the camera follows behind the killer as he approaches his unknowing victims; there are also classic shots that are the inverse of this, in which he's entered the frame from behind the girls. This dichotomy illustrates the tension between the more playful elements of the film and the more sinister ones. The killer, as much as he is shown on screen from the get-go, is considerably creepy, and the sense of threat is consistent throughout. The performances are a mixed bag, but by and large are perfectly fine.Overall, ""The Slumber Party Massacre"" was a surprise success for me. Given the derivative and somewhat hokey title, I had many preconceptions about this film that were blown away once I finally had a chance to watch it. It's not a flawless film, but it is certainly well done for what it is. Memorable and moody cinematography lends the film a gritty edge, and there are more than enough playful and menacing moments to be had. Despite its slight ventures into humor, it's a far darker and more serious slasher film than you may expect. 8/10.",The Slumberparty Massacre

Doritos? Check. Beer? Check. Maui Wowie? Check. Pizza? Check. Too bad, though, that psycho driller killer Russ Thorn has just busted out of jail and has decided to crash the party... Anyway, although my beloved ""DVD Delirium"" book claims that this film has not ""a single moment of cinematic fat"" in its 78-minute length, I would have to respectfully disagree. There are SO many instances of false alarms here (you know the kind I mean...you think the boogeyman is about to pounce and it turns out to be a cat or something) that things get rather annoying. Sure, I know that these moments, used with discretion, can add to a film's suspense, but when you string over a dozen of them together, it gets pretty old and downright frustrating. The last 20 minutes of the film are fine, though, as nutzo Thorn tries to finish his night's work with a clean party sweep. It is a little hard to believe that this film, which revels in topless shots and shrieking bimbos, was written by feminist author Rita Mae Brown and directed by another woman, Amy Jones. Still, it IS a group of women that ultimately gives Thorn a tough time, after the doofy boys fail (although it is fairly obvious who will be the last girls standing).

Story is about a bunch of teenage girls who decide to have a slumber party one Friday night but what they don't know is that a mentally disturbed man has escaped and is roaming about the same area where he committed his crimes in 1969. The party is held at the home of Trish (Michelle Michaels) and her friends who are attending are Diane (Gina Mari), Kimberly (Debra Deliso), and Jackie (Andree Honore) but her next door neighbor is Valerie (Robin Stille) who is the new kid in school and has been has been treated unfairly by Diane so she decides not to show up.*****SPOILER ALERT***** Lurking around the house is Russ Thorn (Michael Villella) who's an escaped mental patient and armed with a two foot power drill that he uses to kill everyone that he comes in contact with. From horny boyfriends to oddball neighbors Thorn kills them all and starts to pile them into the trunk of a car but it's the pretty teenage girls at the party that seem to be where his real interest lies.This is directed by Amy Holden Jones and written by Rita Mae Brown and just goes to show that even female movie makers want to make money because this is one of those films that has become a cult favorite. You know your about to see an exploitation classic when during the opening credits actress Michaels has already started getting naked for the camera! We have all seen our share of shower scenes but the one that takes place at school in the girls gym makes you re-check who made this film because you would swear that a man was involved. The camera pans from one girls tight butt up to their perky boobs and then moves on to the next girl where we see the same thing! While the camera pans from one naked girl to the next it's absolutely impossible to concentrate on what exactly they are chatting about but the scene is there for one point and it's to show nudity and nothing more! There were a few things that I couldn't help but notice and the first is the goofy (and seemingly sexually indifferent) neighbor David who spends his Friday nights by the woodpile killing snails with a cleaver. He didn't seem to care that there are some hot chicks parading around and instead mutters ""that makes 53 tonight""! Stille who plays Valerie is the spittin' image of Virginia Madsen and as big a compliment as that is it was Jennifer Meyers (as Courtney) who stayed in my mind because she's one of the few girls I have seen sporting a mullet for a hairdo. The cast is basically unknowns but the one familiar face (and body!) that is recognizable is Brinke Stevens who plays Linda and she's the first nude body that we see in the shower scene. What makes this film work is how basic it's premise is as it has the usual gratuitous nudity and gore and show's you early on who the killer is without having the audience think who might be the one responsible. It's simplicity makes this a film that's hard to dislike as it delivers exactly what it advertises and offers none of the ridiculous plot twists that usually has viewers rolling their eyes. This has become quite the cult sensation and it's fairly easy to see why and while it's certainly no cinema classic it is a piece of exploitation that works perfectly on it's own.",The Slumberparty Massacre

It's not a wholly successful film especially in the sense that it becomes a decent version of the movie its trying to send up.

The fact that the identity of the (male) killer is known from the get-go, does change the angle, as does the fact that several women here do things which are stereotypically done by men. Still, the male fantasy parts, in which gorgeous girls bare themselves continuously, does not seem so feminist, but then consider the fact that the female writer wrote explicit lesbian novels also... I really liked this different-and-yet-not-so-different take on the slasher genre, maybe not for all the right reasons, but hey...The killer reminded me of another film creep: Killer Bob from Twin Peaks, I'm curious if David Lynch could have been inspired by this...? With this character, the film does earn its feminist label; when he finally speaks, it is sexist, nihilist nonsense, and he is castrated in the end, and killed, only by a few girls who fight for their lives. Good on them.But will it make me think and reconsider ever watching male chauvinist slashers again? Yes, to the first, no to the latter. Blood, gore and female nudity are facts of life, why not combine them into a titillating movie? Moreover, usually in those male chauvinist slashers, there's a deeper story behind the killings, and there are not only female victims, but also male.As a feminist statement, 'Slumber party massacre' works only partly, but it's more like an extra, a 'thing' that makes the film stand out more than most slashers, even if I should not end before saying ""point taken"".A big 8 out of 10.",The Slumberparty Massacre

I watched every single retro slasher film they played and this one was by far one of the most enjoyable. Sure it is just a simple low-budget horror outing rife with chances to criticize it (as Siskel and Ebert, Leonard Maltin and many others did upon release), but what is maybe not-so-simple and not-so-typical in this critically disreputed genre is that it is put together with enthusiasm, a good sense of humor and surprising attention to detail. And while it provides the requisite nude scenes and gory murders, it does not put viewers to sleep in between the exploitation.In other words, compared to the absolute crap we horror fans are subjected to nowadays, this movie is funny, clever, entertaining and fast-paced. SPM possesses a genuine sense of fun that is just about extinct in today's slasher movies.

Very interestingly, this film has TWO lead girls, Trish and Valerie, with separate yet overlapping subplots. The two high-schoolers are both on the basketball team and live across the street from each other. Trish is the popular girl with all the friends and Valerie is the new girl at school who doesn't quite fit in. Valerie defies all the cliches. Even though she looks the part of the silly spoiled mean girl, she's quite the opposite: extremely nice, smart, and responsible. Trish, while on the surface seems nice and fair, turns out to be kind of shallow and selfish. Trish has the A plot of hosting the party of the title and Valerie's subplot involves caring for her very obnoxious little sister (super annoying character). The rest of the characters include Trish's even more vapid clique of friends and teammates who are part of the slumber party, her next door neighbor (single dude in his 30s who is way too interested in what a group of teenage girls are doing), and the girls' basketball coach (who looks about the same age as them).The movie's villain is an escaped mental patient known as The Driller Killer and this guy doesn't play around. No taunting, no games. He just cuts to the chase.
The movie does a good job of balancing it's slasher-horror element with the requisite amounts of humor, teen hijinks, sibling angst, and teamwork. The creepy nighttime neighborhood setting feels like a character itself as the director judiciously shoots both interior and exterior scenes.

Here lighting, music, grueling set pieces, good acting and an OK sense of humor ensured that Christmas was always going to have a dark side. Made before Halloween so in some ways this film could be considered the granddaddy of all slashers.Now these are three excellent films and belong as top referrers to any horror lover. Then there are those copycats and while some are really good (some Friday sequels, some Halloween sequels, The Burning, My Bloody Valentine for instance) many are not at all good. Many films fall somewhere in between, displaying some features that are to be admired. Films like ""The Prowler"", ""Happy Birthday To Me"", ""Prom Night"", ""Dead and Buried"", ""Maniac"" and ""The House on Sorority Row"" have some features working for them, be it atmosphere, gore, solid display of originality or good craftsmanship - something ensures they have good entertainment value.Then there are those that have none of that, just copy from better movies and do it in a cheap, unimaginative and talentless fashion. Now seriously, those who won't find this little outburst of mine helpful will agree to the fact this this film has any of the features that make a solid horror movie.It's horribly acted with one badly staged set piece swiftly followed by another. The set ups here are painfully bad (that pizza delivery boy who's just had his eyes drilled out was a particular fav). Honestly, I wish there was a comment section here so I could have admirers of the film point out to me what they liked and why.Now, maybe I was just in a really foul mood when I watched this and I certainly don't want to imply that those who like it are any certain type of individuals, hell, I like some movies that get horrible beatings here. But, in my humble opinion, it's movies like ""Slumber Party Massacre"" that gave slashers a bad name and I'm just amazed to see that many horror lovers seem to think highly of it.",The Slumberparty Massacre
64,gregsrants,"Slahser film that offers nothing new, just had things borrowed and left me blue",3,2 March 2008,"My two favorite things in the world are slumber parties and massacres so having both represented in a horror film title was titillating to say the least. Slumber Party Massacre boasting a movie poster that had four scantly clad women viewed from between the legs of the killer was something of teenage pin up fantasy. The phallic killing weapon of choice is a portable drill with a bit the size of John Holmes. The victims are a bunch of high school girls that look as old as College sophomores but thanks to the tight form fitting fashions of the time (the film was shot in 1982) they are every bit as sexually stimulating as they were intended.So with the setting established  a slumber party at the home of one of the girls homes, the characters all exposed as expendable and the killer on the loose after having escaped authorities, we were set for some bloodletting.There is nothing new about Slumber Party Massacre. Even in 1982, the film was a rip of just about every other horror film that was hitting the theatres in rapid releases. Even the film's score was an organ key shade away from John Carpenter's classic Halloween winning number.Surprisingly directed by Amy Holden Jones (women directing horror films were not of the norm), the film does at least try to use the horror playbook to ensure that all the plays are executed. We have a shower scene that is definitely a press pause and zoom experience. There are countless individuals that are lined up as plausible victims. And there is a killer that has a kill toy of choice even if he doesn't have any kind of personality present within the film's frames.Slumber Party Massacre was originally written with the intention of being a slasher movie spoof. It was reconstructed into the straight horror that it ends up becoming, but the resonating humor is still present throughout the film.One of the worst things that can happen after viewing a horror film is having the details of the film forgotten. This is exactly Slumber Party Massacre's problem. I remember the shower scene, but just two days since my revisit to the experience, I can't remember anything notable about the films plot, it's characters and most importantly, it's killing.www.robertsreviews.com www.killerreviews.com",The Slumberparty Massacre

This isn't any different from other Slashers that came out at this time, An escaped mental patient escapes and torments the young girls who are home alone, nothing new, but this one is done with such a subtle knowing finesse, poking fun at the conventions of plot with gratuitous nudity, black humour, purposely dizzy dialogue, gobs of gore, in-jokes, and more ""boo"" scenes than you'll be able to keep up with. But make no mistake, it's got its share of seriousness too, and that's a good thing too... there are some pretty tense scenes that give it balance. There's a particular scene with a young Brinke Stevens (apparently she was offered a bigger role and had to turn it down) being stalked through the halls of a high school... she almost gets away, but is given away by her trail of blood... probably one of my favourite stalking scenes in a slasher movie. It's not a movie afraid to keep you on your toes either; This movie delivers a short-but-sweet and neatly packed into eighty-minutes. The script has a dry wit and the characters get you involved. Overall, a fun flick that doesn't take itself too seriously, knows it's limitations, and above all, let's you have fun with it.",The Slumberparty Massacre

Yes, it is terribly clichéd, predictable and stupid but ""Slumber Party Massacre"" does not skimp on the nudity and body count which is really all a slasher is. The story (or lack thereof) is about a psycho who has escaped a mental institution somehow and happens to stumble on a group of girls planning a slumber party. Breasts, 2-foot long power drills, dope, booze, false scares, dead pizza guys and death follows (a body count of 12 to be precise). This is all crammed into a nice running time of 74 minutes! Honestly, I do not understand why this movie has such a low rating when it isn't as bad as it sounds. It is an entertaining movie that delivers what an 80's slasher always does.

One might just gather that from the DVD cover or poster for this film. It takes the predictable elements of the ""splatter"" film and with a complete lack of seriousness has a ton of fun with them.

Only the final scene has a bit of value, though compared to other films it's not offering much.

One thing they missed, and apparently not lost on Rita Mae Brown, was that it was almost always a female that ""dispatched"" the killer at the end, sometimes with the help of a male lead.  On the one sheet for this movie we see the killer with a drill hanging between his legs like an oversized penis and the message is clear--fight back women and you wont get ""drilled"".  But dont get me wrong guys, on the way to her womens lib message, the director provides more than her share of titilation for your average slobbering teenage(or older) boy.

While the girls get high and order pizza Russ waits in the shadow with his huge drill and begins picking them off.

With slasher films getting clobbered by critics due to their violence towards women at the time, Jones and Brown use every cliché in the book with gratuitous nudity and gore! They would say this was a parody and there are some flashes of that, but this is a straight ahead slasher film. An early scene has Linda (Brinke Stevens) locked in the school gym and dodging the killer. This scene draws out some real suspense and the scene is visually engaging.

The director, Amy Holden, uses the effective route of playing the slasher stuff straight and inserting clever visual jokes when she has the opportunity. Although it's a slasher movie of the horror genre, the film feels good-natured, most likely due to the humorous scenes with sisters Courtney and Valerie.

Join the dots.Mary Holden Jones brings to the screen a screenplay by Rita Mae Brown. This was supposed to be a 'feminist' slasher movie in what is considered to be a deeply misogynistic genre. Hence we have young women flicking through Playgirl, expressing their desires when it comes to men and women who show they can kick ass.But is the film as good a slasher as it proports to be? It starts well enough with engaging characters, a great tone and a fantastic spundtrack. But when it comes to the actual horror it feels generic, unscary and very cliched. The number of tedious jump scares grates on the nerves after a while. And who is cruel enough to lock a cat in a closet?!Yes, the killer has a big drill. Yes, we know what that signifies. Yes, we also know what it means when one of the women breaks his 'big tool' in two. If only this film built suspense and tension first I would have been more impressed instead of it relying on cheap thrills and techniques from 'Slasher Movies For Dummies'.There is some great humour in the film. Check out the pizza delivery guy getting killed with one of the women later feeling no remorse for tucking into the pizza. Hunger doesn't abate just because the delivery guy gets drilled through the eye sockets whilst doing his rounds.But this is pretty anaemic stuff. Don't waste your time.

Problem is a silent, stone faced killer Russ Thorn (Michael Villella) has escaped from a mental institution and is ready to wreck havoc on this party.Thing is there is something more to this 1982 slasher than just kills and scantily clad women. As you can guess the weapon of choice for Russ Thorn is a drill. I think it is a great weapon almost like Freddy Krueger and his glove. And yes there is some sexual under current to the story other than what your eyes can see. I enjoyed in how the film was shot (by director Amy Holden Jones) and extra parts to the script written by Rita Mae Brown (like more going on than just a psycho guy with a drill coming to kill you) that really aren't in your average slasher. Also I really enjoyed the gothic-styled music by Ralph Jones that suits the film just fine. I short one though, running in at only 77 minutes.

Well, I had expected more from this movie as far as the blood and guts were concerned because it seemed that just when the killer would get ready to kill the victim, the scene switched and you never got to see what happened, you just saw the victim lying in a pool of blood after the killing and that really annoyed me to no end.

82,tequila101,"Classic Horror, Nuff Said",7,26 January 2012,"I have seen ""The Slumber Party Massacre"" 3 times now. And to be honest I love it but I still stand by my rating above. It's an OK slasher but it definitely has a lot of clichés' going for it and a lot of 'fake' boo scares which should'nt have been there. It will never rank up with ""Halloween (1978)"" or ""Black Christmas (1974)"" but it sure is one of the most underrated slashers of the 1980's.First off, let's talk about the plot: The plot was great. Definitely not what you get from most modern slashers these days. This girl is left alone while her parents goes away. While they're gone, she decides to invited friends over, to have a SLUMBER PARTY. A killer called Russ Thorn though is on the loose and happens to make his way to the party. AND KILL THEM! Yes really a good plot which never suffered from gap holes.I loved the musical score. Quite chilling and undeniably scary. They say this is a spoof but I believe that this music really rang a door bell for me because it was that scary. It was like 8 bit music mixed in with stalkerish, piano-ish music. It was that darn creepy! The actors are all fine. They were all very convincing and the actress who played as Courtney was my favorite. She was really beautiful bringing innocence and naughtiness to her roll. The other girls were good. Just not as good as her.The guy who played as Russ Thorn was good. He's not a really memorable killer and he just runs around with a power drill, killing all these girls in weird, and bizarre ways. I thought that it was done OK, but he is definitely not a Billy Lenz or Michael Myers. He wouldn't rank up with them because sometimes he was a little off edge. But he did a pretty creepy job.I also liked the overall tone of this film.The cliché'd 'fake' boo scare did not work for me at all. It was just a little unnecessary and it didn't make me laugh nor get scared. If they wouldn't have used them, the film would've been 100% more scary in atmosphere and tension.Overall I can't really complain about this film that much. It's not up with many of the other greats, but it certainly beats a fair amount of cheesy, unworthy modern-like ones I've been seeing. Ones such as Uwe Boll's undeniably terrible ""Seed"" or the ""Sorority Row"" Remake from 2009. Those film were badly made for all the wrong reasons.But on another note, ""Slumber"" is definitely a good dose of slasher. Watch this at night time and I tell you, you will not regret it.It's 7 bloody power drills out of 10 for me. This film doesn't even come close to a 5.2/10.",The Slumberparty Massacre

Upon rewatching, I'm sure the biggest reason I was so tittilated as a teen was the ample (and, well, not so ample) teen girl nudity (lots of topless scenes). While I still enjoyed it, as it has all the hallmarks of a ""classic"" early 80's slasher flick, it doesn't have the gore that I remember. At first I thought maybe I had normalized to modern fx practices, but I watch a ton of other similar movies with similar budgets and such, but quickly realized that wasn't it. What it was turned out to be one simple fact...it just wasn't that gory.Be that as it may, it's still a fun watch and is chock full of (what are now) clichés, subtle hints of what have become one-liners, classic screams, a bunch of kills, ""creepy"" 80's synth sounds, and a good all around production.While many people bash this aspect of the early slasher movies, I enjoy the stupid decisions kids make in horror movies. You know...
""Don't worry, even though I know shouldn't, I'll go out there alone,""""Yeh, one of my friends was just randomly killed...oh wait....2...no 3...no 4...it's still ok to open the front door,""""(Before crazy horror acts begin) Ooooh, I'm scared to go in the garage to get a get something, but (now that a deranged killer is stalking my party) I'll go outside and to the neighbor's house and see if they're ok after hearing screams, phones going dead, and my gym teacher disappeared doing the same thing.""The first rule of watch most movies, but horror in general, is to never question ""WHY."" You just gotta to with it. Sure...modern horror has become great at making movies that prey on realistic(ish) possibilities, but most of the 70's/80's/90's slashers lived and died by these seemingly stupid decisions. Besides, without them, how would anybody die?All in all, this is still a fun watch, especially if you haven't seen it or are a fan of the early horror mores. While this might seem like breaking that ""first rule"" I just listed, the one comment I would make about SPM, which I don't care for, is that we see the killer's face almost immediately upon the movie beginning. It's no big deal, but there is an air of mystery and creep factor when the killer's face is obscured until the end. Again, no biggy, but a note.Parental content:
plenty of profanitydrug (pot), alcohol, and cigarette useseveral female topless scenesa good number of kills, with ample blood, and maybe a tinge of gore, but nothing that would be considered drastic, and most very unrealisticdo I consider it scary or intense? Not at all, but based on intent and attempt, the whole flick is supposed to be scary and intense.If you like classic horror, teen slashers, or the likes, definitely put this on the watch list.",The Slumberparty Massacre

Sure it's not the bloodiest, scariest, well acted or written horror movie that wonderful 80's produced- but it does have something that makes it special and a standout on its own.Trish (Michelle Michaels) is a popular basketball player whose parents have gone away for the weekend. Just so happens that the night before, convicted killer and mental patient Russ Thorn (wonderfully played by Michael Villella) has escaped from confinement. Awww...timing is everything! Val (Robin Stille) is the new girl in school as well as on the basketball team, who also happens to live right next door to Trish. Of course, Trish decides to gather her girls for a night of fun at her empty house. She suggests they invite Val, and is of course is rejected by her snobby & trampy friend Diane (Gina Mari).Cut to the chase...the girls have there slumber party. Of course Russ has been following them around all day and is just waiting for his moment to strike. Val on the other hand is alone too next door, with the exception of her boy crazy 13 year old sister Courtney (Jennifer Meyers). When the pizza delivery boy shows up dead on Trish's doorstep- mayhem ensues. The girls (along with some boys who have crashed the Slumber Party) are scared to death. They are afraid to leave the house - so the boys volunteer to make a run for it.One by one our teenagers get hacked away. Eventually Val and Courtney get involved in the goings on and before you know it our girls are in some serious trouble.The movie works due to some genuinely funny comedic dialogue- and Michael Villella's great portrayal of the Driller Killer. When he says ""I love you"" in his sick and twisted way- you genuinely feel creeped out! The music is also quite good as well. With a 77 minute run time- Slumber Party Massacre doesn't drag and keeps pace quite nicely.

The movie is obviously made to appeal to young men, with scenes of nudity that serve no purpose, as well as roaming shots of naked teenage girl's bodies as they shower yet despite the unnecessary nudity Slumber Party Massacre' still works as enjoyable slasher movie. Taking probably influence from Abel Ferrara's Driller Killer' (1979), Slumber Party Massacre' is a bloody, absorbing and moderately entertaining horror movie featuring some inventive scenarios, numerous fake scares, sporadic attempts at black humour (such as the refrigerator scene) and some of the standard slasher movie clichés. Unlike many similar movies such as Friday the 13th' and Halloween' there is an attempt to actually develop the characters, though such attempts prove to be desultory in the end.The screenplay (written by Rita Mae Brown), no matter how unrealistic, is of an average quality for this type of film as is the acting. No specific performance stands out except perhaps that of Robin Rochelle (Babs from Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl-A-Rama' (1987) who sadly commited suicide in 1996) in the role of the out-casted Valerie who continually fears that something is not quite right at Trish's home. Michael Villella is particularly creepy as the psychotic Russ Thorn. His relentless stalking of his `prey' is similar to that of such characters as Michael Myers and Jason Voorhees. The character of Russ Thorn benefits somewhat from something that the other aforementioned characters lacked  humanity. Thorn is a human killer and kills because of a psychological disease rather than the standard senseless stalk-n-slash characteristics of many other slasher movie villains. These attributes, in some ways, make Russ Thorn a far more intimidating and unsettling presence. Thorn is presented as a manic, yet intelligent, murderer. His presence on screen is both portentous and alarming.Fans of slasher movies such as Halloween' (1978), Friday the 13th' (1980) and Sorority House Massacre' (1987) will probably enjoy this fun little addition to the slasher sub-genre. Though Slumber Party Massacre' offers nothing new to the horror genre it is still an entertaining movie with a number of memorable sequences. The black humour within the movie is infrequent and does not over-shadow the horror aspect. An unsettling musical score and reasonably competent direction help to ensure that Slumber Party Massacre', though nothing special, does not become inherently tedious. It's far from great, but not too bad overall. My rating for Slumber Party Massacre'  6.5/10.",The Slumberparty Massacre

90,FrightMeter,"The perfect horror film to watch at a, uh, slumber party!",8,11 March 2002,"""The Slumber Party Massacre,"" written and directed by women, is a perfect definition of what an 80's slasher movie is.  Girls, gore, and psycho killer. It was never meant to be nothing more.  With that in mind, it is one of the most entertaining entries into the genre around that time period. Basically, a killer with absolutely no motive shows up at a high school slumber party with his handy drill to pick off the teens one by one. (And an occasional pizza guy!!)  I guess it can't get much simpler than that.  Some disturbing murder sequences, a wonderful final showdown between the killer and virginal heroine, and countless cheesey dialogue, make this a worthwhile flick for any horror fan.  7 out of 10.",The Slumberparty Massacre

So, what's not to like?! At least it delivers the goods, it has a pretty high body count and, while not Dead Alive, it has enough blood and gore to satisfy a horror fan such as myself. The killer is pretty retarded, not very scary, but he gets pretty creepy towards the end. He ain't no Michael Myers, that's for sure. The main protagonist is cool and likable, mainly for her disdain for the ""cool"" girls and her dry humor. The ""cool"" girls are extremely obnoxious and piggish, so you don't really mind watching them get there's.

They are so cheesy now, but having grown up in the 80's, it is fun to watch them and be taken back to my parents basement when we would watch these ""really scary"" movies as kids!Anyway, Slumber Party Massacre is not original. If you have seen Halloween, Friday the 13th, or any of the dozens of slasher-horror movies, then you know what happens here.So the plot is that a mass-murderer escaped from prison recently and he begins killing high schoolers almost immediately. You know the rest, some kids have a slumber party where the murderer descends and gore and blood ensue.This movie has all the typical 80's horror movie elements: gratuitous nudity, lots of blood and gory death scenes, mediocre acting, and ever- present ""boo"" scary music.Spoilers:Now, like I said, pretty much all the slasher movies are the same, other than the killer and his weapon of choice. In this movie, the killer picks a power drill (or whatever it is called) as his weapon of choice. That would not have been my pick if I were a mass-murderer. I mean, sure it can be efficient, but it sure is bulky, and very noisy. You better hope that there are a lot of coincidental cover noises around when you are dispatching another hapless teen. Luckily for this killer, there are plenty of blenders and other noises to allow him to kill around a dozen people before people suspect something!I laughed out loud at some of the scenes...especially the par where the killer is running from the school, where he recently killed a girl, in broad daylight with his bloody drill and he's looking around to see if anyone sees him...hahaha, I mean, subtlety is not this guy's motif!And of course there is plenty of nudity. Lot's breasts in this movie and an prolonged shower scene where the camera actually does a slow pan down a girl's back to see her butt. I'm not complaining but at least in other movies, the nudity isn't this blatant.The acting is about what you expect from a movie like this...below average.

97,ColonelPuntridge,Watch this as a double-feature with ...,7,7 November 2020,"For a refreshing demonstration of contrast, I suggest watching this feminist slasher parody as a double feature with Don't Answer the Phone! (1980), if you can tolerate two of these things in one evening. The latter is one of the most misogynistic I've ever seen. It's graphic and exceptionally brutal. Most of the victims very stupid, helpless, ridiculous types and the camerawork invites us to join with the murderer in laughing at their suffering. The murderer (a strangler, not, strictly speaking, a slasher) is played by an amazing actor (the great Nicholas Worth) who endows him with the special negative-glamor of a reality-show host with political ambitions. There isn't even a traditional virgin girl who overcomes the killer or at least escapes; this one can only be resolved by a very manly cop who is as ruthless as the killer is.(The female director-writer team of SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE may have been familiar with DON'T ANSWER THE PHONE, which had been in theaters (sleazy ones) for two years when SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE was released. I say this because the working title while filming SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE was ""DON'T OPEN THE DOOR"".)So, if you are a normal person who just likes the genre, watch DON'T ANSWER THE PHONE first, and then cleanse your palate with SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE. If, on the other hand, you are an angry, bitter InCel who likes reality-show hosts with political ambitions, watch SPM first as a titillating appetizer and then gorge on the heavy beefsteak in DATP.",The Slumberparty Massacre
98,davidmalaimo,Such a perfect little slasher film,9,5 November 2018,"It seems most people tend to be of the same mind(despite the difference in ratings). This is a slasher film at its bare bone roots. But as someone else said, it has some great attention to detail, and it's very tense. Every scene is interesting. The director really knows how to direct your attention. For instance, there's a scene where a girl winds up a wind-up toy as she talks on the phone. You hear the phone call as you watch the little wind-up toy. A lot fun and interesting little anecdotes.After I watched the movie I looked up the IMDB page, and was happy to see it was written by a female. There's a shower scene at the beginning that totally felt like it was written by a dude; the dialogue was very silly whilst you get shots of boobs and girls saying ""wow your boobs are getting big"". I wonder if that was just some stuff the director added in there or if it was sort of a way for the writer to give us the girls the average 80s movie-goer would expect and then flesh out the characters and surprise you with their depth(at least by slasher standards). But almost every character is likeable in a way, and you really dont want to see anyone die. I kind of feel bad for them, even in the slasherverse where life really isn't as important as it is in reality.The killer is interesting. It definitely gave something a try. No mask. Just a dude. (This isn't really a spoiler, we learn that quite early in the movie). In many ways it's interesting, they really show him, his facial expressions. He's not a killer in the shadows. He just gets at it. He has more presence and it feels a little realer in that sense. I didn't particularly like him as the killer, didn't hate it. Thought it was a neat idea, but easy to see why it's not a movie that's iconic in a sense. I'd like to see it get mentioned more. Whenever people look for slasher suggestions I'll definitely mention this. In the same spirit that makes Sorority Row so good, it's just a damn good slasher that knows what it's doing.",The Slumberparty Massacre
99,theskylabadventure,One of the better 80s slasher movies,6,20 January 2008,"If the title hasn't already sold you, I doubt I'll be able to convince you that this film is worth a look.The plot is a slightly tweaked and thinly veiled rip off of 'Halloween', but this movie doesn't take itself anywhere near as seriously as John Carpenter's classic shocker, and this is perhaps its saving grace.Like all good horror movies of the period, 'The Slumber Party Massacre' aims to provide us with two things; mild titillation though its utterly shameless use of female nudity and cheap thrills though its corny murder moments. While the latter is hardly on a par with many slashers, it is a bit of fun. Some of the murders are quite inventive, if a little sparing on the gore.As far as the nudity goes, the premise dictates a fairly abundant use of boobs and thighs. While some may consider this sexist, it is important to note that the director is actually a woman. Stick that in your feminist pipe and choke on it!Happilly, not only is the film graced with some deliciously and flagrantly gratuitous breast exposure, but the owners of said breasts are uniformly gorgeous. Movies like 'The Mutilator' (which contained not just ugly but fully-clothed ugly women) could learn a lot from this masterpiece of schlock!This is not to everyone's taste but, if you've read this far with a smile on your face, I'm pretty sure it's the film for you.",The Slumberparty Massacre

This film is also a slasher that follows a feminist perspective and does very well in doing so with dialogue and imagery and isn't overpowering in it's views. There are over a 100 reviews on this movie that give an amazing synopsis so instead i will go over what this film does well at and what it fails at. First this film has some of the best imagery you can hope for in a movie, the underlying message is also expressed well. Next the atmosphere throughout is on par with others of the slasher genre but in certain scenes it truly excels. The films characters are also very strong and having women in generally male roles is very unique. Next the killer is generally intimidating and gives a very solemn performance. Next the story and plot run smoothly through the film. Also a big fan of the gore in the film. I can't say the film fails too much at anything. The weakest part of the film is how naive some of the characters are and some standard slasher fare but most of that can be expected with a film of this era. Overall there really isn't much you can complain about. If you want to see the film it is available for free on amazon with subscription. If you want a physical copy there are plenty of versions but the best is the 3 film collection with the other 2 films in the series, sadly it is out of print and does cost quite a bit, the lowest on amazon is 70 dollars and ebay ranges but the lowest i say was about 35 dollars including shipping.",The Slumberparty Massacre

I'd be curious to see how the original script for this read and if it was a little diluted during the filmmaking process, because some of these smarter moments still shine through, but most of the time it does play out like your average, run of the mill slasher.

So does a murderous escaped killer with a cordless power drill that would make Tim 'the Toolman' Taylor grunt with envy. He picks them off one by one but who will survive?One of the better low budget flicks to come from producer Roger Corman, its a pretty straight forward slasher flick... there's no mystery about who the killer is and you get a good look at him pretty early in the story. What makes it stand out is it's adherence to the early slasher flick tropes... good use of shadows for suspense, closeups of the victims and maniacal killer, good amounts of blood (although tame by today's standard's, some gratuitous nudity (scream queen Brinke Stevens earliest role) and a little bit of humor.What makes it camp? Sporadic bouts of flat acting and a giant phallic instrument of death! Modern horror fans will see the inspiration for the garage scene from the first Scream movie and the van scene from the sequel.

Yet there is nothing at all to distinguish it from the same type of films directed by men.  A psycho escapes from a booby hatch and decides to kill girls (and guys when they get in the way) with a power drill.  This is the second of the driller killer movies, beginning with Abel Ferrara's THE DRILLER KILLER and ending with Brian DePalma's BODY DOUBLE.  Here the killer's name is Russ Thorn, and that's all we find out about him, except that he killed five people in 1969. The movie never explains how he became insane.  There is one shot in the film when he has a girl cornered with his drill.  We see the girl's face between the killer's legs as he lowers the drill toward her.  Perhaps impotence is the reason?  Or maybe he's related to Damien Thorn.  The film has all the required elements of a low budget slasher flick--female nudity, false alarms, blood, strange noises, mistaken identities, etc.  The film was made on a low budget, using only a handful of locations (it takes place mostly inside two neighboring houses) and actors.  It does have a few shocks, though, especially the first murder.  Whatever you do, don't see part 2 of this trilogy, which is completely beyond belief.",The Slumberparty Massacre

Very few ironic touches remain - of the few I can recall, one is a scene in which the killer counts the bodies in the trunk of the car, finds that he's one short, and goes off in pursuit of a second try at the severely wounded victim, and the other is the scene in which he is more enraged at the amputation of his phallus/drill bit than his hand.I feel that I am in agreement with Ms. Brown that irony and subtle satire are an exercise in futility when aimed at the average American media consumer, and also in agreement with Ambrose Bierce when he describes wit as the salt of literature the lack of which cripples our artistic cuisine. Our audiences are unable to recognize humor without a laugh track. I, for one, would like to see someone to do ""Sleepless Nights"" as it was originally intended.",The Slumberparty Massacre

However, Russ doesn't show up with booze, instead he brings along a huge drill, which is his primary weapon.

109,edeighton,A feminist style slasher parody film (SPOILERS),7,25 October 2019,"My Review of The Slumber Party Massacre SPOILERS
""You're pretty. All of you are very pretty."" ""It takes a lot of love for a person to do something like this""How weird is it that my Grandpa and Grandma introduced me to this movie, when I was about 12 or 13 years old? My grandparents went through a phase where they loved renting horror movies in the mid 1980s. I can remember watching this one at their house as a young teenager. At the time, I was blown away by the ""awesome"" nudity and what I considered to be graphic violence. I loved the Killer, Russ Thorn, as he was one of the more unique horror villains (a drill killer) I had encountered thus far. While I only saw The Slumber Party Massacre that one time, for years, I frequently referenced it as one of the best of the slasher films I had seen, perhaps because it was one of the few unedited for television movies I had watched.Imagine my surprise when I re-watched The Slumber Party Massacre this week and discovered that it was actually pretty tame compared to the movies I have since seen over the past thirty some years. Right off the bat, I picked up on some of the more subversive humor contained in this movie that I would not have appreciated as a young teenager. This movie is not your average slasher film.The Slumber Party Massacre is one of the few slasher films both written and directed by females. The screen writer, Rita Mae Brown, is a noted lesbian-feminist author who wrote mystery novels under the pretense that they were co-authored by her cat. Rita Mae Brown's script was originally titled Don't Open the Door and was designed with the sole intention of poking fun at the slasher movie genre. The director, Amy Holden Jones was actually an editor who worked on numerous Roger Corman films. For some reason, Amy Holden Jones took an interest in Rita Mae Brown's script and wanted to try her hand at directing it. Amy Holden Jones had a difficult time attracting any investors to finance the film until she convinced her husband, veteran cameraman, Michael Chapman (who shot both Godfather and Jaws) to film a nine minute promo reel for next to nothing. This promo reel was later used in The Slumber Party Massacre and convinced Roger Corman to finance the $200k required to get the project off the ground. While Amy Holden Jones insists that her film should be considered a dark comedy, she never told that to the cast and they played it straight down the line.Considering the all female writer and director combo, its no surprise that feminist themes are promoted in The Slumber Party Massacre. Typically male roles are instead played by females: the gym coach, the carpenter and the telephone repairman. Writer, Rita Mae Brown wrote this movie as a metaphor about female objectification by men. The ladies in this movie are constantly spied upon, peeped at, stalked and assaulted by men. Far from being the sexist exploitation film that it appears to be at first viewing, The Slumber Party Massacre is intentionally critical of sexism. The men in this film get far more graphic deaths than their female counterparts. The female protagonists are very confident in their own sexuality and work together to kill the male slasher. The iconic weapon the killer uses is clearly a phallic symbol and at the end of the movie the drill is cut off (in half) by the female lead character. Rita Mae Brown intended the character of Russ Thorn (the drill Killer) to be a commentary on the way that male killers compensate for their pent-up sexual frustration. This is never more literal than the moment when he stands astride one cowering female victim with whirring drill bit at full stretch between his legs as he prepares for penetration. Russ Thorn is more outraged by the amputation of his phallus/drill bit than his hand. The men in this film are all portrayed in an unflattering manner, wimpy, ineffective and creepy. The woman are portrayed as athletic, beautiful, fun and sympathetic.Here are a few quick one hit observations:
*The character of Courtney (Valerie's kid sister) is looking at a Playgirl magazine with Sylvester Stallone on the front cover.
* There are quite a bit of dark comedy bits that shine through in this film: the dead girl in the fridge keeps slowly falling out without the sisters noticing; the killer counts the bodies in the trunk of the car, finds that he's one short, and goes off in pursuit of a second try at the severely wounded high school boy; the killer makes reference to how many people he has killed so far (six) when the kids ask how much the pizza costs.
*Perhaps the most subversively unflattering portrayal of masculinity is the character of the neighbor, David Contant. He assures Trish's parents that he will ""look in on her"" while they are out of town and then later lets himself into Trish's house. Notice that David Contant enters the scene from upstairs (in Trish's bedroom?). What was he doing up there? Maybe the bag of Maui Wowie weed was not the only thing he was sniffing in Trish's house. He is constantly finding reason to hang around the girls and act like a cool adult. He prowls around outside Trish's house at night allegedly killing snails to protect his garden? Likely story...was he actually peeping in on the naked high school girls just like the high school boys were doing?",The Slumberparty Massacre
110,marcialyon,Life Goes On After All,9,11 February 2020,"There's a moment in the middle of Slumber Party Massacre where one of the would-be victims is inspecting the body of an eyeless pizza delivery man who's lying cold on their living room floor, pizza in hand. She reaches into the pizza box, takes out a slice of pizza, and takes a bite of it. This is when The Slumber Party Massacre won me over.Before that point, it's honestly hard to tell what the film is going for. It's shot, edited, and scored like just about any other slasher film from this time period and any humor seems unintentional for the most part, but it was that moment that I realized it was going for parody and the whole thing came to life for me.The characters feel like real young women and there's even a little bit of suspense sprinkled in.

111,benjaminryder-45940,Drink Your Kool Aid,8,30 August 2019,"Some movies just hit all the right buttons for you and The Slumber Party Massacre is one of those films for me. It's an odd mix of traditional slasher with boobs and blood for days and a feminist send up of said slasher films. Sometimes, these two contrasting ideas make for strange bedfellows and, other times, they work rather well together.The titular slumber party is being thrown by a young woman (names aren't very important or even memorable here) who invites all her basketball team friends over for one last hurrah before doing away with childish things and becoming a woman. Of course, there are a few nosy boys who want in on the action, too, but they mostly keep to themselves by peeping through the windows as the girls prance around in negligees and less. The ""weird"" girl from school lives next door and she's in charge of watching over her horn dog younger sister who keeps issues of Playgirl lying around. In time honored slasher tradition, there's also a bug eyed guy with a power drill lurking around and waiting to make his next move.The Slumber Party Massacre possesses a strong sense of humor throughout that keeps things feeling light and breezy and the cast seems to be having a lot of fun. The synth-y organ score is great fun, too. Visually, it's nothing too exiting and feels very flat and bland, but the script and quirky characters more than make up for it.

Full of erotic girls, a** and t*ts, blood and enjoyment. Thought it helped me pass the time. The sequels suck, but has their fan base.

113,currax,Uninspired Garbage,1,2 September 2000,"This movie seems to have some fans; I am not one of them.  Okay, this is a slasher movie, so I wasn't expecting a great movie, but The Slumber Party Massacre is just uninspired garbage.  The killings are boring (no pun intended).  There really isn't any decent gore, just some bloody t-shirts. There is no atmosphere; the film just feels bland.  The music is unexceptional.  Everything is just so mediocre, and that really hurts this movie.  Slasher movies usually at least have one interesting element.  This doesn't even have an interesting killer.  It's just some 40-something guy in ordinary clothes.  I never thought I'd say this, but The Slumber Party Massacre makes me appreciate all the interesting elements in a movie like Class Reunion Massacre.  I really don't see how so many people rated this a 10!  It's not even bad enough to like it on a cheesy level.  This movie is just bland.",The Slumberparty Massacre

Lots of busty girls get drilled to death, but this movie is unique for its portrayal of the strong athletic woman who takes charge. Subtle lesbian references and weak male characters make for some interesting comedy as the madman with a power drill attacks a slumber party.

115,larawoolley,Excellent slasher/driller killer film - it is what it is!,8,9 August 2012,"Yeah, I gave this a high rating - it's totally worth it. I don't understand why some ratings for this film are so low - it's an 80s slasher, what are you expecting? There were plenty of gruesome kills, it didn't take the film long to get in to the killing so doesn't keep you waiting like some modern slasher films do. There is a good, basic story line which doesn't make the film difficult to follow. We are reminded throughout the film that a killer has escaped from jail so it's not a random attacker. The loose ends are tied up, there aren't any questions left unanswered at the end (apart from when she plays her piano after she thinks she hears someone in her house, haha)and the story line isn't dragged out unnecessarily. I totally recommend this film and will be buying the DVD to watch again (I watched it on the horror channel). I find that the older slasher/ driller killer films are far better than the more modern horror flicks - the killing is more original, better thought out and more believable.",The Slumberparty Massacre

Eighteen-year-old Trish is left home alone by her parents and decides to have a slumber party with her high school basketball teammates.  None of them are aware of the fact that Russ Thorne (who has murdered five people in the area 13 years before), has just escaped and is armed with a portable electric drill.  Of course, he will be making an appearance at the party.  There isn't that much gore in this movie, if that's what you're looking for.  However, there is a lot of female nudity. Hey, this is a HORROR movie we're talking about.  Anyway, this movie offers a lot of suspense and is highly recommended.

A few stupid guys to mix things up a little. That's what's so great about these kinds of golden flicks: they don't even try. But why try when you can put boobs on it? Watch this when your movie-watching needs meet the following criteria: (a) you're doing an '80s slasher marathon Halloween party, (b)you're stuck in the house on a rainy eve with absolutely nothing else to watch, the cable's blitzed, and you're tired of porn, or (c) you're a film student pretending to study feminist influence in postmodern film.

I watched the movie 3 times already and I'm looking forward to see parts 2 & 3 on DVD even though I heard that they sucked. I wonder what the remake of this movie would be like?

So we rented it and sure enough, it delivered. Using every horror cliche in the book, SPM was good to the last kill. The cheesy dialogue, naive characters and a crazed killer out on the loose come together to make a superb film. After doing research on its production, it turns out that the film was written by an ultra-feminist, who purposely wrote the film to be overtly exploitative and degrading towards females. By trying to hit the viewer over the head with moral commentary, she inadvertently made a cult classic in my book. A great film to have at a party!",The Slumberparty Massacre
122,sevenup@neo.rr.com,Good Film On A Low Budget,9,11 January 2005,"It's been several years ago since I last saw this film and it really is an amazing movie to see.From the very beginning it's very obvious that it was made on a low budget,however it's still an amazing film to see!Halloween was made on the slimmest of budgets as well and Slumber Party Massacre proves like Halloween that an excellent film can be made on a tiny budget.From the very beginning,it's score promises a chiller with creepiness oozing out of it's pores!I admire these filmmakers for what they accomplished. It's a spooky movie with a sense of humor,but often the parts which are meant to be frightening are very effectively handled such as the girl who's pulled into her truck to be murdered and also the student who's trapped in her school's locker room while she desperately tries to escape from the killer who's stalking her.....both scenes are great and handled with good direction,good acting,good camera work,a great score and a real understanding of how to make a chiller that will grip an audience.This describes the entire film which it's main part takes place in an old house populated by teenage girls who are falling prey to an escaped murderer who repeats some philosophy used by real life killer Charles Manson.Yes, this film has it's faults...the actress who plays the younger sister named Courtney is too old for her part and she's also just not very good in playing her part.Also the male neighbor who's supposed to keep an eye on the girls is miscast in the role because he's too young.However,these are extremely minor things when you look at this picture in it's entirety which is a real accomplishment that can entertain a true lover of good chillers. Every time that I watch it I can't help but be amazed at how good this film is even though it's made on the smallest of budgets.It's proof you don't need a million dollars and well known actors to make a good movie.",The Slumberparty Massacre
123,KFear,An 80's slasher at it's best,7,20 August 2005,i love the 80's well...almost at it's best. I've seen more gore in other 80's horror flicks. but if you want nudity and lots and lots of screaming girls getting knocked off one by one by a mad man with a power drill...it's a real safe rent. the scares will not make you jump out of your seat...but really...it's just a movie meant for you to sit back and laugh at. For slasher fans...it's a must see. hold on though...is it breaking a slasher movie rule to have the killer talk to his victims??? i was wondering that when it happened. still though it doesn't take away from the overall experience. oh yeah. just watch this one...don't bother with the others. they are not at all worth it.kjfear@yahoo.com,The Slumberparty Massacre

125,Sinister_Zombie,Not a bad 80's slasher,7,6 June 2006,"Managed to get this one cheap and enjoyed watching it, but could be better.In the same vein as Halloween (though not nearly as good) it manages to create that classic 80's suspense. The basic premise is that there is a slumber party and the teenagers begin to get picked off one by one - your pretty standard slasher affair. In terms of nudity we get a few decent glimpses of T&A and I would say thats OK, its not overdone.Blood is sadly lacking I'm afraid. Although it picks up a bit at the end, it still leaves the film feeling a bit ""bare"". Halloween can enthral its audience with suspense and atmosphere, but as this film lacks a bit in this department, we're left with a gap to fill.Complaints aside, it does the job pretty well, we have a houseful of satisfyingly terrified teenagers, lots of screaming and running and some decent music.But yeah, if you're a slasher fan or a fan of 80's horror in general, I recommend giving this a view. Just to say you've seen it, and its a good Halloween substitute (I thought I could go a review without mentioning Halloween, but oh well).",The Slumberparty Massacre

Sure we have had great slashers before and after, but to have a slasher written and directed by women is awesome. The acting was awesome. I had no problem with any bad acting at all in the film. The storyline was great and I really enjoy the fact you don't know much about the killer himself. It leaves him dark and somewhat a mystery. The girls in the film seemed for most part to have their own personalities, but you did have the somewhat mean girl who didn't like the new girl.

I have definitely not seen  many horror films so far, so there may be many better ones than  this, but I thought it was definitely worth our time and good in the  sense of a rollicking film that was not toooo graphic or disturbing. 7/10 (for a low-budget '80s horror flick)",The Slumberparty Massacre
128,Gregory_Livingstone,77 Minutes In Hell,1,30 July 2007,"Wow...I don't even know what to say...TERRIBLE MOVIE...I suppose they inserted topless teenage girl scenes to regain any audience interest, but I hate to say it...Even that wasn't enough to make me enjoy this film. the sound is terrible, the killer's character is not established at all, that is to say he has absolutely no motive whatsoever. the effects are terrible... and what really gets me is how they turned this into a series. I'd much rather stick to my Jason, Freddy and Michael...hell i would even take Chucky over this garbage heap. the one good thing i can say about this movie is that it wraps up rather quickly i believe the DVD reads 77 minutes. The people i feel bad for are the one's renting/buying this film expecting a cheesy slasher flick and ending up with something much much worse. the true horror in this film lies in it's production..not it's content.",The Slumberparty Massacre

Although, i couldn't help but enjoy this film. There are some downs to this film though. The acting is somewhat cheesy and weak at times. There are no plot twists at all, which was slightly disappointing. The plot in general really is not overly complicated. What you read in the summary is exactly what you get. Character depth is somewhat shallow. But these cons really seem to fade away when the film comes together. It's a lot of fun if you enjoy slasher films. Silly teens get killed throughout, which is relieving, as there are one too many slashers out there with murder gaps. It's quite understandable that it has gained somewhat of a cult following.

Several dashboard cracks and swiss cheese frame, you get the picture.  It's a very typical horror film, lots of breasts and lots of death.  The killer runs around with a strange drill that he uses to plunge into his victims, yet he holds it up in the air as if plunging it into them would help the drilling process.  Idiot!There was a meaningless shower scene where the cameraman apparently has too much fun while shooting the women's bodies.  No relevance at all to the plot. Also, at one time the killer the killer decides to take a nap after finishing a brutal murder.  He just sorta grabs a blanket and lays of the ground, while there were still girls running around in the house.  I would be a little smarter than that.",The Slumberparty Massacre

All the random cats in this movie are also awesome.There is just a random cat here or there - one of the cats just drinks milk.I saw this movie with some of my homies the other night, and afterward Boogens came on - the Boogens looked like it would rule as hard as this and then it didn't.

However, the humor it's still there, as shown in the People's Temple's references and the fact that hunger is just a problem on top of the other; despite serial killers lurking in the vicinity.

137,khadimara,Meta physics in horror,7,14 August 2021,"The movie opens up with like insane amounts of nudity, accompanied by just the most pedestrian lingering camera views. This immediately establishes what director Amy Holden Jones is about, as she recreates the male gaze--cleverly parodies it--as the boring, uninspired thing that it is, the dull objectification of women. Still, there's a ton of female nudity, and it is an extremely slippery slope to satirize something while upholding it. I think what Jones is doing is really forcing the holder of the male gaze to feel cruddy about it, and in this, she is extremely successful. It's hard to really hold viewers accountable, and even harder to figure out how to do it, but Jones does. There is so much else that is so clever about this movie.",The Slumberparty Massacre
