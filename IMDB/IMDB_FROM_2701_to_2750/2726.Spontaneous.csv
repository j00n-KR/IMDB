0,SnoopyStyle,powerful non-solution,8,2 January 2021,"Mara Carlyle (Katherine Langford) is a regular high school senior and then a classmate spontaneously explodes in class. Film nerd Dylan Hovemeyer (Charlie Plummer) is driven to act on his longtime crush on Mara. They begin a romance as more students explode.The students could have done more to try to solve their exploding problem. It's interesting that the movie doesn't try to concentrate on that. It's almost an unknowable problem analogous to mass shootings. Like so many big problems facing the youth today, they are almost helpless in the face of them and that's how these kids react in this movie. The thoughts and prayers moment says it all. It's also the E.T. Elliott moment. The problem is too big and they make a joke of it. Langford continues to play the casually cool chick very well. Plummer has an endearing quality which makes sense for the couple. It's a very sweet chemistry. I wasn't sure about the handling of the central problem until the prom. It leads to a terrific moment for the students and brings out their inner thought in a powerful way. Some may want this premise to be explained away scientifically but there is a power about the way this movie chooses to handle it.",Spontaneous
1,nogodnomasters,It happened again,7,26 November 2020,"At Covington High School, teens are exploding for no reason. The film centers on Mara Carlyle (Katherine Langford) and her now found love in Dylan (Charlie Plummer). Realizing life is short they quickly become lovers and do drugs as their classmates explode around them. It could be worse. They could be Republicans as Mara jokes.It was a decent dark comedy as teens dealing with their own mortality. Mara provides a lot of first person narration.Guide: plenty of F-words. Implied sex. No nudity.",Spontaneous
2,Quinoa1984,"""What am I supposed to do now?""",8,4 January 2021,"Spontaneous is a minor marvel: a fresh, violent, wholly romantic and totally devastating movie that shifts tones and managds to be about... A lot. And as far as 2020 movies, much superior as (unintentional) cinematic metaphor for Covid than She Dies Tomorrow - matter of fact, this really is probably the most emotionally succinct film we've had about metaphorically what it's been like to live these pasy godforsaken months (and as it keeps on going).And I'm sure Brian Duffield left the symbolism to interpretation on any given number of fronts (school shootings? Suicide? Ironic that this stars the 13 Reasons woman, and she is as my wife tells me so unlike her part in that, but anyway). Duffield's arguable high master-stroke is simple really: Langford and Plummer are just great together with splendid chemistr6 and you enjoy seeing them be goofy and dopey and funny teens... Which...Like, what if John Green but Stephen King(?) That's about as gigantic a compliment as I can think to grant it. And what's so remarkable is, without givvng too much away, Duffield does the thing you kind of expect to happen... But the pathos is so completely off the charts and your heart just aches and breaks and it strikes you that this incredibly sweet and often very funny teenage love story treats death with more sincerity than more supposedly serious-intended dramas have over the years. It has a few logical flaws that I could get into (involving the potential mystical properties of... Being a Senior and, like, why the school isn't rushing graduation even into the Bye Bye Life montage), but why carp?Let me put it this way Rob Huebel, who you might remember from those old Moviefone ads (""Mauled by a tiger!), is such a good actor in this. Who knew?",Spontaneous
3,westsideschl,More Funny Than Enlightening,2,27 March 2021,"I didn't see the point/plot. I wonder if there was one. Central character seems to be losing her classmates to self explosions. Why, who knows, and I ended up not caring. Explosions were actually just seeing splattered red paint afterwards (cheap) - nothing else, no pieces, no bones, organs. Usual romance hook to keep some of the audience awake, and have something relatable. Acting/dialogue high school drama class level.",Spontaneous
4,ops-52535,"the covington syndrome, an explosive surprise, the best of its kind ive ever seen",10,7 October 2020,"Wow, that was the longest of all the long headlines i use to writs, and thats i due to several reasons. first when i put this film on , i did expect a teenage love/romance movie, and i got it + a bit extra. second i expected some teenage bleeding hearts, and i got that too + a heck of a lot of it. third i expected a lot of charming love, sex and flirting love, and i got that too+ a lot of love BLOWN away like instant coffee in a cup of hot water. fourt expectation was comedy, and i felt that to, + some crazy comedy twists that that im bloody sure you havent seen before. my fifth expectation was action and reaction and a little bit of nerve, got my hands filled + all the buddies hanging onto me. sixth expectation was to see handsome actors a actresses, and i just fell in love with her....so i think all the ones that gives this movie less than 5 , have a deranged mind on the principles of irony, black comedy and gore in a relative safe and regulated setting. i , the grumpy old man, gives thkis a 10 stars after first view, and that is some serious business, and i'm for sure not paid for it, sitting in my chair wearing only my prison stripes underpants, waiting for my pain medicine to start working, so that i can start maintaining my life as synthetically as it can be done.its also a take on fright for disease, with quaranteening and isolation, reston suites and suits, government officials hoping and praying to find a cure, making a killing field of medical experiments till a immunizing cure is found, and by all means the people have no trust at all towards the cdc and nhs and fbi and cia.so the silver line words are, love, hope despair, shock, terror, blood,broken relations, drugs, fungi, alternative cures, schools importance and a wicked outburst of bad coincidence in the era of pandemic terror and angst..but to make it short its a film about a young girl that really do feel life is good and adventourous, that every day has a glimmer of hope, and that everybody are good to her as shes to them. then , all of a sudden in the classroom the girl who sits in front of our main character, blows up in a red rain of blood...is it spontainous and coincidental... well have a look , you wont regret it.actors and extras, well some of the best appearances on its genre this year, the extras are so believable in their frenzy and friendship so youre eaten into the horrors of frightousness, but the mains, and especially the lead female is a sensation on its own.its a lovely choice by the casters to apprehende that some naturally fruitfull body is ok to use in the movies, it seems like the skinny and bony ones have been put on hold in this film.productionwise, im impressed by the special effects, , audio and visual, and do wonder how much they used, and how they made that blood look like...blood. the musical score have a nice surprise ,with a wide selection of music made to enhance the plot, and the songs by hooters made this even better. filmographic its as it should be, the location management and design are great.story, well its in the ''i''-form with all the challenges that sets for the production.so if you want a film full of speed and surprise and bloody gore + a whole lot of love, and fright and sadness, the grumpy old man thinks its the marvel of unexpectedness, and therefore a big recommend",Spontaneous
5,marmar-69780,Spontaneous,7,9 January 2021,"Spontaneous is a fine black comedy that has some good laughs in it and some goofy moments that worked for me this film,in some films such staff annoys me but here it worked i guess i was in a good mood for it.The best thing outside goofinies and deaths is Langford who here give one very fun performance and she stole every scene with her presance and personality.Plummer was also good and they had a good chemistry between them.Spontaneous is a good black comedy about life and other things",Spontaneous
6,southdavid,Bonny Langford,6,2 March 2021,"""Spontaneous"" was a spontan..... impulsive . . . choice for a movie to watch of a Saturday evening, based on nothing more than the few words that sum up the plot and its availability on the Sky Planner. Ultimately, I came away a bit disappointed, as the second half of the movie doesn't quite live up to the first.When members of their senior class begin randomly and spontaneously explode Mara (Kathrine Langford) begins a relationship with Dylan (Charlie Plummer) speared on by the understanding that, for seemingly no reason, any moment could be their last. Whilst the government and FBI struggle to provide the class with any answers Mara and Dylan try to make the most of whatever time they might have.The first half of the movie was, I thought, really good. Langford is charming and Mara is a genuinely funny character. Her friendship with Hayley Law's Tess and relationship with Charlie Plummer's Dylan are nicely played - particularly the partnership with Plummer that seems to include a couple of improvised moments when they stayed in character, which were well done. I rooted for that couple. I don't like that I'm old enough that Piper Perabo is playing mothers with teenage daughters, but I guess there's not much I can do about that.The second half of the movie isn't as strong though. Though there are clearly spoilery moments I could go into, I don't think it's much of one to say that no reason for the explosions is ever provided. Whilst I don't think that all movies need to be tied up in a nice bow, the lack of explanation rather left the story hanging. There are ruminations on seizing the day and the truth that our lives could end at any moment. There's a connection, however ill fitting given this is a black comedy, to high school shootings too. Ultimately though, after the midpoint it's just not as funny or interesting as it was in the first half.",Spontaneous

Not a horror comedy!!,8,26 April 2021,"At 1st I was going to rate this film a 5 or 6 because I was told it's a comedy horror and as such I prefer films in that genre like evil dead series, dead alive, dead snow, etc. This film to me was a drama/romantic/comedy, and features fantastic acting by the whole cast and a really excellent story. Has some blood and gore but not enough for a horror I was never scared or jumped .

12,jfgibson73,Cutesy,6,6 March 2021,"The characters and dialog in this movie straddled the line between clever and annoying for me. I had to take breaks to get through it. Kids start blowing up in high school. No one knows why and panic ensues. For a while, I assumed the common thread was the protagonist, Mara, and it seems like it's leading you in that direction. Late in the movie, however, there is a scene where everyone starts confessing that they feel like the explosions are their own fault for different reasons. I liked that moment because it illustrates how everyone thinks they are the center of their own universe. After that, Mara gets over herself and learns to live. I enjoyed the movie, but it didn't inspire me to live for the moment myself. It was kind of heavy handed. Like I said, it was right on the border of being intolerable for most of the way through. I think the fact that the main character just had enough charisma made it bearable.",Spontaneous

14,aidanratesmovies,"It was good, but it could have been so much better",8,21 January 2021,"This was a very weird film for me, and i'm not just talking about the subject matter. I absolutely adored the first hour or so of this film, but the final act is, and I hate to say it, just a bummer mess. The first hour of this film is perfect and here's why: We have the immensely talented charms of Katherine Langford and Charlie Plummer, both of which have excellent chemistry throughout the film. We have a clever and slick little form of storytelling that feels like it should get old after a while, but surprisingly never does. The film is boasted with humor, romance, and just so many things to smile and marvel at, it's impossible not to enjoy. And then we get to the final third of this film, the last act, and the reason why I wasn't able to love it as much as I thought I was along the way. Now, I get what the writers were trying to do with this ending. I have never read the book, nor do I know how it ends, so I can't say if it is similar or not. All I know is, it feels incredibly uneven and often depressing. One of my favorite things when it comes to film is giving the characters involved a backbone or a reason to care for them, a reason to sympathize with some of the actions they may do. This however, just feels forced, and I could hardly stand to watch it at times. It has some moving moments, but it goes to far from what it set up to be in anyway meaningful. Another problem I had, was just how frustrating it is. The film writes itself into a corner, and in an attempt to savor itself, it scrambles for answers, any answers really, and it just feels like a frantic attempt of a conclusion rather than the harsh path it set along for. Not to mention it is also unsatisfying, you never find out why everyone is exploding, which I feel is kinda important. In the end, Spontaneous could have been an excellent film, but instead it proved to be a decent one.
My Rating: 8.75/10",Spontaneous
15,questl-18592,Spontaneous Human Explosion Syndrome,3,23 April 2021,"First and foremost, when this movie says people explode, they are NOT kidding! For people not into a TON of blood, you mahy want to skip this because humans randomly pop like waterballoons filled with chunky ketchup. That's really what drew me in though, because say what you will about Spontaneous, it's got a unique idea and really goes all in on it.And sadly, that's the end of my compliments. I did not care for this movie at all. The acting felt so forced and clunky to me, the romantic elements annoyed me and the complete lack of any explanation for why anything is happening is something I would love in a lot more movies but in this one I was so annoyed I just wanted something, anything to grab hold of. Plummer, I've seen him in two things now counting Chasing Alaska and I just am not digging this dude. His whole delivery and sort've slow, depressed vibe just doesn't click right with me. Langford I want to like but so far I'm just not sure I feel any range from her yet. Love Simon, Knives Out, solid movies but I can't say she really impressed me in any of them and this is no exception.I feel like that's the major problem here, there's probably potential but I think there's a failure to really hit the mark. I got such Warm Bodies vibes here from the tone, a quirky dark comedy about preternatural forces and no real explanation for things starring some young talent. It's generic fun with a decent bit of creativity but it feels like it completely misses the mark and instead of hitting it out of the park the ball flies foul and just feels like nothing.Despite me really not enjoying this, I think there is absolutely a market for this and a lot of people that will love it so I would recommend people that enjoy quirky teen romance comedies to check this out because it is stylish and creative it just felt supremely devoid of substance to me. Now I just need Langford/Plummer to show me something impressive because I really want to see something out of these two but so far I am not amused!",Spontaneous
16,saadgkhan,"An Exploding LoveStory, we didn't knew we needed!!!",7,15 October 2020,"Spontaneous - B+ (Memorable)Spontaneous uses it's exploding metaphor to school shootings around USA to full potential. Your best friends, classmates are dying and noone can do anything about it. Everyone thinks that something wrong with the kids, lock them up, take their phones away or put them on medication. Washington will look after them One day and that day never comes. They go back to same cycle till the school is not over and it is to be believed that everything will be Fine one day.I have to say noone plays a Teenager like Katherine Langford. She was fantastic in Thirteen Reasons Why and that's why the show connected with millions of people around the globe positively or negatively but it was due to her realistic portrayal of New Girl lost in new school. She is soo different from her role as Hannah and still she made it her own a teenager trying her best to deal with loss of her classmates. Charlie Plummer is a delight as always. You should watch him in King Jack and Looking for Alaska.On the whole, it's a unique take on a very serious matter and it makes sure to use it's platform to bring awareness and showcase the survival's grief which never goes away.",Spontaneous

Starring Katheryn Langford (Love Simon) as a young woman who finds love with a charming loner played by a charming Charlie Plummer during this odd epidemic. The movie treats it's subject matter in a very genuine, smart way so it's never a full horror tinged comedy but more of a horrible event happening to funny people.

The Covington curse explosions are somehow the metaphor for it. No matter how hard you try, things will happen or not. You won't get to know before it happens. Mara was a good character but I found Tess and Dylan more interesting. Dylan exploded while they were hugging and his jawline hit her forehead leaving a scar. It was really sad when Mara and Dylan's mother talked while they were lying down on Dylan's grave. Then she hit the road with the old ice cream truck of Dylan. He drove past her high school which was going to be torn down. And ended up smoking hookah at her beach house with Tess. It was quite dark but somehow uplifting at the same time and hilarious, too.

22,0w0,"Humorous, but not funny...",6,12 October 2020,"The movie is 'OK'... it's an 'OK' comedy, and an 'OK' romance, and an 'OK' drama... it's not particularly good in either of these categories and especially for the 'drama' part of the film, it could have been much much better if it explores the main aspect of the plot more: What caused it? Why does it only affect certain people? How was it cured? If the movie didn't leave these questions unanswered then it could have flushed out the story of the movie much more and also focused more on the drama portion of the film.But those issues aside, the acting in the movie was actually impressive: Katherine Langford's performance was most impressive and Charlie Plummer as well did a very good job. I didn't expect such good performances from these two relatively unknown (and young) actors. So honestly, the acting in this movie isn't the reason why the movie was poor, it's the other aspects ie. plot, script, directing, length, etc.Overall it's an 'OK' movie to watch once... but it absolutely won't warrant repeated viewings. It's a shame, because the movie could have been 8/10 with just a few changes.",Spontaneous

Her performance is wise, strong and bad-ass. I can't wait to see what Langford does next. Charlie Plummer is endearing, and the chemistry between Langford and him is fiery.

30,richardwworkman,Brilliant.,7,18 February 2021,"Many of the reviews seem to be focused on the clear link between Spontaneous and the Covid pandemic and ignoring the fact that this film was made before the global health crisis.This film is actually about high school shootings in the US and simply asks the question, if it wasn't a kid with a gun and student simply started exploding, what would happen?I have to say I wondered all the way through this why so many people gave it such poor reviews. Then I realised that this is in many ways social commentary and open criticism of American republican government headed by Donald Trump.Theses a wonderful darkness to this bitter sweet tale of the senselessness of indiscriminate death in American High Schools. There's more than a couple of references to gun crime and social commentary with the direct reference to a ""shooter"" after the first death.The scenes of panic in the high school as the students explode are horrific.The impotence of government with the political speak and use of ""Thoughts and prayers"" was particularly relevant. Government is seen as disinterested and seeking to avert blame rather than solving the crisis.There are some truly beautiful life affirming moments which makes the sudden deaths all the more devastating as we gradually empathise with the characters.The impermanence of existence, the briefness of youth and the anxiety associated waiting for something terrible to happen in the height of a global pandemic has particularly relevance at the moment.Growing up in a pandemic, surrounded by death and waiting for the worst to happen isn't the message of this film. I loved the optimism and hopefulness. The moments of comedy made this a wonderful and touching tribute to the dead.In the future we might look back at this film and realise how important it is. It's dark, funny, horrible and deeply political.A wonderful film.",Spontaneous

But I really did enjoy this film.The message herein, that sometimes bad stuff just happens to good people for no reason, is a metaphor for school shootings, I'm guessing, but this film also rings timely during a pandemic when millions of good, decent humans, who didn't deserve to die, did.I thought the acting was mostly good if understandably amateurish at times, I dug the soundtrack, and I thought the delivery was very poignant.I bet you can draw a direct venn diagram between those who rated this film poorly because they didn't understand ""the point"", and those who hate it for political reasons alone.",Spontaneous

35,shide_85,"Semi-original concept, with fatalist bs underlying every twist and turn",3,29 December 2020,"In short:
These teenage movies come along most years, what should girl or guy do as they grow up into adulthood. This movie aparantly has the answer, it simply doesn't matter - you can't impact the key things of your life either way...
If it only had been focused on dying and death as the thing not to fear it would have been decent. But that is not it and the monologue towards the end (if u hadn't gotten it by then) makes it perfectly clear. This is que sera, sera in movie form, with a well produced movie under.Those who believe the world is chaos on a stick is either living in a fascist state or is incredibly naive. Ruining a movie and possibly lives with it is a shame.Cinematographically it's up to par, uses some clichés abundantly clear, more mockingly than anything else. Some references as the one to ETis thrown in with effect - making clear connotations to well known movies works as it should ""good by association"" - if you dont actually consider the message of the movie for more than a couple of seconds.
Yes, the upside is that it deals a little with procrasternation and impact of choice, the bad is the illogical reasoning and do whatever because it doesn't matter because everything is out of your hands anyway message...Early on i found it refreshing and decent enough, but the more i watched it seemed like the writers and director had lost something key to holding it together.Pro's

The most obvious thing. I think the reviewer who said it was a metaphor for school shootings gave it far too much credit - it could have been, but it wasn't that smart in that sense either. It's an okay movie at best but wow, did it miss an opportunity to be a great movie by being written without any awareness or intelligence.

44,korythacher,"POP! POP! A charming love story, but not a horror comedy",7,27 July 2021,"I really enjoyed this movie, but its absolutely not a horror comedy, and there's a good chance you'll be disappointed if that's what you're after.This is a charming love story between an awkward boy and a ""weird girl"" who doesn't care what people think. I'd give it a 6.5/10 if I could.Technically it does deliver the story it promises, but the blood explosions take a back seat and are just used to move the characters around while they fall in love. The explosions are pretty well timed, usually going off when you really want them to, but it doesn't really give off many horror vibes.There is a decent amount of dark comedy, but it isn't the focus and I wouldn't call it a comedy. The movie has a few solid jokes, mostly towards the beginning half, which was certainly better than the end.I think the almost-constant banter between the two teens is pretty cute; there are enough little witticisms that its very fun to follow along. The dialogue isn't great in some scenes, but it wasn't bad enough to dislike the film.Rating the movie was pretty difficult because they really lost a lot of the internal logic of the blood explosion side of things, which meant the background story made less-and-less sense as the movie progressed. It really took away from the whole experience.They spent a lot of extra time lingering on scenes, which was really captivating for a while, but then it started to make it feel really slow. They probably could have shaved 10-20 minutes out without missing anything.Similarly, the dialogue degraded around the halfway mark and the ending felt really flat.If they'd made the B-story better and had a different ending I'd definitely give it a couple more points.Overall, we were expecting a horror comedy and most of the group seemed disappointed, but I really enjoyed it for what it is. If you want a semi-emotional teenage love story with *some* comedy and blood explosions then you'll probably like this too.",Spontaneous

47,cristinalinderman,A creative adaptation about life.,7,16 October 2020,"* There is no end credit scene *The director Brian Duffield and crew brought a creative adaptation about life. The story sets when students begin literally exploding and two seniors struggle to survive while their love blossoms. One can't focus on the why because it wasn't important, the movie was about life, love, and friendship. A viewpoint of showing the fact that life is not fair, one has to make the most of it and always take risks because one will never know what could happen.The exploding scenes were thrilling it keeps one alert on who will be next and even though the significance of the story was straightforward from the get-go it was still entertaining to watch how everything unfolded. The approach of how love sparked was very awkwardly and cutely while their world was falling apart. Having said that the movie needed improvement, when the high point hit suddenly the scenes were dragging and it never recovered almost over repeating the point.The composer Joseph Trapanese brought the perfect music so down to earth, it defined life, love, and everything that surrounded the lives of these teens.The cast was solid especially the main female actor Katherine Langford. Her expressions of every situation were enjoyable and when she narrated the scenes all her emotions were felt. Also, the chemistry between her and Charlie Plummer was adorable.",Spontaneous
48,asandor,A unique and hard hitting dark-comedy,7,31 December 2020,"OVERVIEW - This film receives a 7/10 in my opinion for the following reasons:
+unique premise and story
+excellent acting
+dark unsettling experience
+wonderful romance between the two leads
+excellent direction
+excellent script
+gritty, hard hitting dark humour
-the gore effects were poor
-some predictable moments
-some side characters were not well actedMy thoughts are as follows:This movie follows a class of seniors in high school that are experiencing a traumatic event; some of them spontaneously explode. Terror follows, as the students do not know who is next, and the government scrambles to find a cure. Revolving around all of this is a romance between two of the students, as they all grapple with impending death and moments of joy as they try and continue living there lives in the shadow of random death.This movie hit me pretty hard. The dark humour is on point, with punchlines literally exploding onto the screen. The romance between the two leads was wonderful and felt heartfelt and real. This film is dark, touching on themes of survival guilt, terror, and teen romance that mirrors events in the real world. I loved many aspects of this film, from the story and script, to the unique premise, this one was an absolute blast, no pun intended. I would like to offer a warning; this movie had some traumatic moments that really effected some of those I watched this with. I enjoy films like this myself, but it is not as quirky as the cover or description may suggest. This was in no way a detraction on the film; quite the contrary in my opinion. Easily recommended from this viewer, as a unique movie that will be enjoyable to those who like oddball films, teen coming of age drama's, and to those who may enjoy a good splash of blood.",Spontaneous
49,Tron79,Good try but the answer isn't drugs and alcohol,5,21 January 2021,"There were timely metaphors in this movie in 2020 as we are all going through the COVID pandemic. Who will die next? Should we wrap ourselves in a cocoon like the teen in class who wore a helmet and duck taped pads? It's a horrible time we are living through. There were excellent performances from Katherine Langford, Charlie Plummer and others. I give 5 stars for the good effort, but the movie lost me with its message that you should just stay drugged up and make the best out of an awful world. At least that's the message I ended up getting. I agree that we should make the most of the time we have, and there is much in our world that is random, senseless and not fair.I give the writers kudos for their message that people try to make sense out of senseless events by blaming God or each other. The problem I had is that the movie seems to condone drugs as a solution, and you might as well be drugged up to mask the pain.I wouldn't call this movie funny if you are looking for a dark comedy. Perhaps the first couple of spontaneous deaths are unexpected and surprising, but after awhile I was not laughing, and I just felt horrible. It hit home when I realized that I could be watching a metaphor for COVID. I didn't pick up a glass of vodka though to make it better. I have seen how addiction can harm my friends and their families and make the problems worse.Good try but the answer isn't drugs.",Spontaneous

I enjoyed the first part of this, but then it sort of died in the last 50 minutes. I kept expecting an explanation that never came: was it all in Mara's head? Was it all some sort of dream (would be totally lame, if so)? Or was this the novel she said she was going to write where everyone died? None of this is explained in the denouement, which is all over the place, anyway. After Dylan explodes, we see a Grieving Drunk Mara in an alcohol-fueled downward spiral that lasts almost half the movie. I've got no problem with the downward spiral bit because that happens in real life, but it went on too long and became tedious. And, not for nothing, it was annoying how the author - Aaron Starmer - tossed in random, anachronistic swipes at Trump to show how ""woke"" he is. Please.Anyway - a reasonably entertaining ride if you don't look too closely. But you may find that - like me - you're glad you didn't pay for it.",Spontaneous

With a supporting cast consisting of best friend Tess (Hayley Law) and parents (Piper Perabo and Rob Huebel), everyone looks for answers in this coming of age love story.This film's overall subject is relatable to everyone at this time. Brian Duffield writes and directs in a way that always holds your attention, and just when you start to settle in, it changes tone. Breaking the fourth wall to walk you through memories or just to get you up to speed, you are always engaged. A long tracking shot early on following Mara and Dylan at a party really nailed this one home for me.The cast for this feature is phenomenal. All of the students trying to continue as if nothing is happening, not knowing if them or their friend next to them will explode, makes you feel for everyone. All of the parents trying to cope with the unknown as well. Mara and Tess's friendship in an u certain world, Dylan bringing a smile to your face when he is on-screen, you can't ask for better performances.It is hard to find flaws in this one. I'm sure there are some sprinkled throughout, but I overlooked every one of them and did not let them enter my mind. The biggest hurdle is watching a film that has teenagers exploding.This is a film everyone should watch, and will no doubt become a teenage classic in the years to come. Trying to navigate through life not know when something is going to happen is a story everyone can relate to.

It is one of the most original teen drama period. Kathrin Langford is on the roll here and carries most the movie on her own. Charlie Plummer gives brilliant performance as well as most supporting cast. This movie has got super funny dialogs and situations that are just laugh out loud.That being said, this movie felt like it was trying to be a satire first but along the way it transitioned into taking subject serious, which didn't always work. In fact, there was an event in the movie where I'd have been fine if it ended there and it'd have become best comedy I've seen all year. But they add further 30 mins on the aftermath where I felt like I was watching a whole different movie. Mind you it was good, but felt out of place.

One that comes to mind is ""Daybreak"", but there are several others I have seen in the last year or so doing this exact thing.It didn't work on any level, period.
The quirky teen romance theme didn't work, every scene with her and her love interest seemed so one note, disingenuous, and badly acted. Pretty much five scenes doing the same exact thing, no progression in any meaningful sense... and between that it had kids exploding. Which funny enough felt completely inconsequential almost throughout the entire film, like it was just a backdrop for the quirky teen romance film and it's lukewarm yolo message to follow your dreams and live your life and go for the love interest you want because life is too short yadee-yada etc etc. You will NEVER get any sort of explanation or payoff with the most interesting aspect of the film which was the spontaneous explosions, so don't bother.No idea how it's as long as it is, I suspect this movie was another classic case of ""unfinished movie badly pieced and edited together""The comedy aspects didn't work, literally cracked a smile one time in total throughout the film, and it's because a joke reminded me about a better joke on American Dad.The Drama didn't work, The actress couldn't even cry in her big drama scene with her exploded boyfriend's mom laying on his grave near the end of the film (her turning point if you will, and it took WAY too long), everything was totally wooden, cringey and campy throughout the entire film. didn't care about any of the characters, I was secretly hoping the main characters would explode at about the 40 minute mark and they would somehow flip the movie on it's head and really give us something else entirely. They may as well have just had the main character ripping massive farts throughout the film (and I hate fart jokes) going in a completely childish scary-movie esque direction... because ANYTHING would have been more entertaining than this trash film we got.The best part of the film was making fun of it the entire time (why it gets a 2 star), but even that got old, Should have just written this review while watching it, could have just went scene by scene and why I hated this movie in more depth.",Spontaneous

The two main characters were terrific and the actors had a lot of chemistry. But, the ending was ultimately pointless. During the entire film, I - like most of the audience I'd imagine - wanted to know what was causing everyone to explode. But we never learned why. Instead, we're left with a generic ""Hey, crap happens and you can die any moment, so live your life to the fullest"" moral. At least, I think that's what the moral was. The music drowned out most of what Mara was saying at the end. Not revealing the cause was a total cop out on the writer/director's part. He could have given us that, which would have added another layer and more impact to the story (maybe Mara's best friend was causing it somehow because she was jealous of her paying attention to others), and still had the ""Hey, crap happens and you can die any moment, so live your life to the fullest"" moral.

Who knows.. I don't think the director knows either, as it switches very quickly between all three genres.. or it's not funny because it's simply, not funny..Langford and Plummer don't seem to fit, can't quite put my finger on it as to what it is but it feels weird and awkward between them, their characters are total opposites, I don't know if it's just their acting abilities, their characters or poor direction, I'm not sure but I didn't find either of them humorous, not in the slightest, they also have zero fake chemistry.. plus they aren't kids, they're both actually in their 20's in this.. well maybe Plummer wasn't but they don't even look like high schoolers.. it can only last so long that they, especially typecast Langford, can play teenager type roles and this isn't one of them..As acting goes, Langford tries, idiotically and a bit cringe, to be this loud, hip, cool, don't give a crap with attitude type chick, with flaky parents, this role has been overplayed so many times now and also way better, there's plenty of face palm type moments from her, I've seen Plummer in one or two decent films but he's only in them as a side note, to just fill the margins.. kind of like Langford has been in the few films I've seen her in.. And how old is Haley Law? She's almost 30, playing a high schooler and she looks that old in this too.. nice casting..Don't waste your money on buying/renting ($15/$10) this, I was lucky enough not to do that.. if so, ask for a refund.. as it's being released as a full price 'cinema' release on VOD now so just simply wait for Amazon Prime to eventually release it as a normal Prime exclusive release to viewers in a few months.. even then, if you've got a spare 90 minutes to waste, watch something more entertaining..",Spontaneous

83,wwejournalist,"More of a Coming of Age Romance than Comedy, but still good!",8,26 February 2021,"This was a weird one.Having finished watching the film with about 90% interest as I also worked on something else, I didn't really have strong feelings toward it either way.The acting was good, the storyline was OK, a little weak in places but nothing terrible, the comedy was there although not quite as in your face as I think most would expect given the main idea of the film.But a day later, and having listened to the soundtrack a few times (the music in this works SO well, it fits every scene like a glove and is great to listen to, especially 'Even' by Julien Baker) I felt moved to write this review, because I feel like the film got to me and I didn't even realise.For a start it made me wish, as I often do, that I had grown up in America and got the full 'High School' experience, which is a strange thing to say having watched a film where the kids at said school explode at random.Secondly it made me think about what I'd do in that situation, when you don't know if every day, or even every minute could be your last.I'd say it's worth a watch if you don't expect a full blown comedy, it's more a 'coming of age/romance' deal with a few laughs thrown in.The negatives, or the big negative for me, and kind of a spoiler, is that there's no answers.I like all the loose ends to be tied up, but here we NEVER find out what is causing the main plot point of the film, and sort of just get told not to worry about it and get on with things.If you can cope with that though, definitely check this one out!",Spontaneous

And that's not a good thing. It preaches that all the good and bad in the world happens for no rhyme or reason, no one is in control, nothing matters, other than surviving and enjoying the moment. It's pure narcissism. It's all about meeeeeee. Me being happy. Me surviving. The allegory it uses to make this point in the film is good and bad people exploding. No explanation as to why, it just happens. And that's a very sad thought. No point. No purpose. Just hope you don't explode and if you don't. Enjoy the moment, because you'll eventually die one day and then it will all be over. No afterwards. Just this. This life.I don't buy it for a second.",Spontaneous

Theyre always the same and never ever anything that would play out in real life so why give you or your partner unrealistic expectations watching something that is just going to set you up for failure.. This movie SPONTANOUSly turned out to be something completely unexpected - REALLY Good and really funny. The romance part is underplayed and mostly the setup as an after thought for the perfectly timed witty one liners that are delivered spot on with real chemistry you can feel between the main actors. The movie is just a take on the traditional coming of age story and how everything when youre young seems like the end or the beginning of the world and with each death of a young persons dream life its never the end but just the transition to another dream of how life will play out.. I dont know if that makes sense to anyone reading this but it was a really great movie witty well acted and moves along at a good pace. It was this directors debut and I cant wait for more projects in the future to be made by them.. Great job,Spontaneous
92,bradleycarrington,Never seen another movie like it.,10,19 April 2021,"So I'm a big fan of horror/disaster movies and I always get a kick out of the deaths/mayhem. This was the first movie I've ever seen where I was genuinely wishing for the mayhem to stop. And not because it was gratuitous or got tired, but because something about this movie felt very authentic and relatable. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time praying for the next death not to come because these kids felt real and I didn't want their story to end. Although the premise is obviously ridiculous, the characters in the movie take it seriously which is such a breath of fresh air from all the movies that know they are movies and make the dialogue consist of nothing more than snappy repartee and quotable sound bites even in the face of despair. Which is not to say there isn't any witty dialogue, in fact it has some of my favorite lines I've heard in movies, but they all feel well placed and authentic. These characters just feel genuine and so you as the viewer can't help but sympathize with them and feel the same sense of dread over their potential demise.Overall, this a very unique movie that I wouldn't hesitate to recommend.",Spontaneous

I popped the disc in to watch with my sister and i was very impressed with how funny it was . . . Until it wasn't. After the 20 min mark, i just realized how much i hated the main character. She was gross, always doing drugs, smoking, always swearing, always making inappropriate jokes, etc. I liked the guy that played Dylan, but he seemed to be really bringing himself down by falling for her. Her friend had common sense sorta, but she also was annoying. She had bas parents, and the entire movie wreaked liberal. They were constantly making stupid political jokes that never landed, and the idea that we were supposed to find it funny was just dumb. It was like the jokes were written by a teenager who spends his life on Twitter. By the time they had sex and she said ""my present to you is my body in a sexual way,"" i felt sick. These were underage kids (in the movie) having sex to fulfill a feminist ideology. Felt like i had watched an entire movie by the 50 minute mark, and i said to my sister ""i can't watch this crap for another 50 minutes."" So we watched Burn Notice instead.",Spontaneous

For some reason the nicest guy in the class likes her. Not really sure except he says she is unique, so some statement that points to her snarky opinions. Her best friend is awesome and sweet too. Don't really understand why this girl has any friends. Movie could have chosen to see what is going on through any of the students eyes, and they chose the character that most people would not wanted to hang out with. No one feels better after hanging out with someone who constantly makes fun of everyone and thinks they are the smartest person. By the end of the movie, we understand that the girls way of dealing with life is just to know that crap happens and you got to live life to the fullest. Clearly at one point this snobbish annoying girls takes a jab at republicans, as if all republicans are idiots. Nice job, now half the audience of the movie for sure can't stand her. The other side should be embarrassed to have her on their side. The guy in this is funny has dreams and cares about others. For some reason the daughter does not even seem to care about her own family. I get she thinks she is about to die, but I was interested in the friend who chose to live her life as well as possible.The other huge issue in this movie is they don't explain crap about what happen or come with a cure. They throw some images out about pills and it all sounds like nonsense. Of course our main character is always the one who is the smartest. Seriously if I was in that class I would pray for a personal explosion, to avoid having to listen to that girl. 2 out of ten just because the boyfriend and best friend are awesome!",Spontaneous

This film however did have a deeper meaning behind it all which was a social commentary of pre-covid times in which drugs and guns were wiping out kids left and right and all we could do was give throughts and prayers.Again the film is not in your face about what you should do about spontaneous things like violence happening however it does remind you of how others might feel.

Would be nice to have a reason behind why they're blowing up but I can accept they didn't give us one.This movie wasn't much of a comedy. Nothing really funny happens. There are lighter moments in this traumatic situation that they try to say makes it a comedy.The main character is confusing to me. She fits into every type of high school girl character but in one person. She's cool/popular, yet she's kind of a loner, the guys seem to want to get with her but she's not an official cool kid. She attempts to be the class clown. Shes mature and immature at the same time. Shes a little bit of everything but has no real identity of her own.If she were to have exploded I'd give this a 8/10. If they did that it would've been easy for them not to explain what happened since she's our narrator and wouldn't have known. But that didn't happen and I'll stick with my 6/10.

116,d0ugdimmadome,David Cronenberg meets John Hughes,6,5 April 2021,"I watched Spontaneous (2020) the other day, the debut film of Bryan Duffield. It's basically an extremely standard coming of age high school rom com with a ridiculous twist - students of one year group at one school keep spontaneously blowing up. It's absurd but unique and engaging, taking an overdone genre and turning it on its head. The tone bounces from funny and endearing to brutal and heartbreaking at its own leisure and that's really what keeps the film alive. Katherine Langford and Charlie Plummer play the students who fall in love during this chaos, but I found both characters and their relationship more cringe than cute. I was also quite unconvinced by both performances and the whole dynamic felt more like someone's fantasy of an edgy teenage relationship rather than a real one. That being said, I still really enjoyed the film, and the strange concept was more than enough to keep me entertained and guessing across the 1 hour 40 min runtime. Knowing that any of the characters on screen could potentially explode at any random moment definitely makes for an interesting watch.Despite my lack of appreciation for the two main characters, Spontaneous gave me enough comedy, blood and suspense to have a good time.

The months of May and August bring stress, confusion and shingles anniversary outbreaks even after all these decades. PTSD wreaked havoc on jobs, marriages and friendships until I finally reached out to the VA around 15 years ago. Thank you VA.The first time I watched this movie I was stricken by Mara's beauty, humor and wisdom. When I felt terror rising in me there would be dark humor, light humor, movie references or a moment of human connection which felt real, not forced. It is a perfect balance for me.I identified with the teacher who was a fellow combat veteran. I identified with young people not knowing who was going to die next or how to stop it. I saw the panic and blood which is part of too many young people's memories from school and mass shootings. The questions they asked were the questions which have gone unanswered in my life. I felt that I was not alone.The politics of this movie mesh perfectly with mine. I have nothing but disgust and animosity toward the NRA. I feel the same way toward the cult which worships Trump.

But if you started to really Think about it, as one or two mentioned before, this Film can and should be seen as a 'Metaphor' and should perhaps be called THAT.
I have always identified the word 'Spontaneous' as a word referenced to A Good Thing. Often heard in sentences like: ""Come On! Let's Be Spontaneous! Let's just Go Do it...""
THIS Film's Definition is the exact opposite of FUN.
While Deaths for NO Apparent reason happen through the film, nobody has ANY answers. No answers as to 'WHY it's happening', and then, it happens AGAIN, and AGAIN...""And the 'Why's' like the body count continue to pile up.

143,catwantsin,"If This Is The Garbage We Are Passing Off As Teen Entertainment, We Are Screwed",1,9 May 2021,"SPONTANEOUS (2020)Tagline: An Explosive Love StoryIn this one we get the story of a high school senior class where kids start randomly exploding. Like all over the freakin place. They story is told from the perspective of a reckless alcoholic who is a horrible friend named Mara (played by Katherine Langford probably best known for her role in KNIVES OUT). What is causing this? Is there a cure? And who will survive?First off, if you watch the preview for this, it's actually got one of the more interesting and bizarre premises of all the 2020 movies. It looks funny and even inspiring. Unfortunately this movie isn't any of that for the vast majority of its run time. It starts out at a pretty break neck and pretty funny speed and feel. Humor is thrown into a pretty dark situation to make this movie watchable.Acting wise Katherine Langford is fantastic. I haven't seen her outside of KNIVES OUT, but her character here is well played. The downside however is that the script and the character both suck. Mara is the last person I would want to be around if my class was exploding. Her friend Tess however (played by Hayley Law) is actually extremely likeable and is a person I would want to be around. Sadly the movie doesn't focus on that, it's more wrapped around the romance between Mara and Dylan (played by Charlie Plummer). Plummer is great in this flick, but again the whole thing unfortunately is sucked into the vortex of oblivion by a Debbie Downer plotline loaded with self-loathing and misery. This damn thing is also loaded with so many unnecessary F-bomb's and just full blown vitriol that it dissects any chance at enjoying this movie after the first 30 minutes or so.I was wondering after seeing what looked like a promising preview why no one was talking about this movie. I mean, I keep my fingers on the moving going pulse the best I can, and from the time this came out till now, no one brought it up. It's possible the timing with the virus hitting the US in 2020, that it was too close to home, but even now that we are out of the pandemic (technically we are in the endemic stage), this effort is still pretty damn rough.The script fails in just about every imaginable way possible even if the purpose was just to get us back out there enjoying life. There are a million ways to tell that story better. This film offers no solution to its problem, it offers no cause to its problem, it offers no assurance after presenting the problem and the little light at the end of the tunnel we do see, oddly seems to point to the fact that Mara is planning to get somewhere in life, with the end goal being almost completely pointless. I don't want to give away too much here, but if there is such a thing as trying to put a bow on a disaster of a movie. That is how this thing ends...only the bow is jacked out. I mean, it's not even a bow you would put on a present your worst enemy.Does SPONTANEOUS have its moments, yes. The first 30 minutes is pretty great... but even that has some really stupid stuff in it that takes away from how good it they could have been.For me this is a 2 out of 7*. Not something I can recommend anyone, especially someone in high school or battling substance abuse ever watch.*Popcorn Unhinged uses a 7 point rating system.",Spontaneous

Langford's performance felt forced and unnatural.

If the rest of the movie was brought up to his level it would have been much better.The soundtrack was okay, although a little too on the nose.I found myself feeling repeatedly bored and struggling to pay attention.

It's not about finding out why kids are spontaneously combusting, or how to cure it. It's just that: terrible things happen to innocent people all the time, and sometimes you just can't explain or control them no matter what you do. In that sense I think it does a great job of touching on the fragility of life. You know that any of the characters could just explode at any moment without warning, and there's just no way to predict it. Any of us can die at any moment, so stop wasting your time on things that don't make you happy.That being said, there were definitely some things I didn't like. The political bits seemed misplaced and clumsy most of the time, and some of the attempts at humor just simply fell flat.Overall, this was a pretty good movie with a solid message.

It seems like people either didn't understand or just didn't like the message of the movie. It's not a romcom as someone said. It's not a coming of age. Not a dramedy. It's just a film about being a teen in today's world. There are some covid and active shooter underpinnings, and it plays directly to a teen demographic. So, for adults who think it's too precocious or ironic or political-that's ok bc it's not meant for you. It tries to touch on all of the foci that impact teens today. This is pretty ambitious which makes the movie a little cramped, like it's trying to check agenda boxes a little too obviously. But again, most teens aren't going dissect the movie to the level that it matters.The idea that people can suddenly die without reason or warning is a real phenomenon that is touched on in tons of films but not in an abstract way like this. It's always so-and-so got cancer or shot etc, or some singular event occurred. The creators took a different direction by expanding the event. The anticlimax of the end really rubbed a lot of people the wrong way-which is hilarious-people have come to expect neatly wrapped films, but that's not reflective of life at all. Life is commonly anticlimactic and full of unanswered questions.Main characters are pretty solid throughout. I agree that scenes w her parents didn't add much to the film overall. I'm not sure if the parents were overly vanilla by design or if just fell flat there.",Spontaneous

Republicans bad, orange man bad, it's REALLY getting old. These are high school kids that can't even vote. Give it up already!",Spontaneous
