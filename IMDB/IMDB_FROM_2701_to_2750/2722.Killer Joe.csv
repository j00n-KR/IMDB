0,bkoganbing,Let's Kill Mom,7,5 January 2013,"You will have to look hard and long for a film that's as quirky as Killer Joe. William Friedkin must have been inspired by the equally quirky Fargo in doing this film.Both films are about people who get into criminal enterprises that really don't have the talent. Bill Macy decides that good way out of his financial difficulty is to arrange to have his wife kidnapped and his rich father-in-law extorted for the ransom in Fargo. In Killer Joe, young Emile Hirsch goes into the drug dealing business and owes some big bucks to some nasty people. So a quick way to some ready cash is to kill his mother and get her insurance policy via the backdoor as his sister Juno Temple is the beneficiary. Major difference between Fargo and Killer Joe is that Macy and his family are good middle class Minnesotans. Hirsch, Temple, their father Thomas Haden Church and his second wife Gina Gershon are Texas lowlife trailer park trash. The first wife, the mother of Hirsch and Temple is Julia Adams and truth be told no one is really going to mourn the passing of this one in any event.Hirsch even has a hit man picked out. It's Matthew McConaughey who is a Dallas police detective and doubles as a hit man on the side. He's both mysterious and dangerous and gradually inserts himself into their family group, especially since he demands as a retainer the nubile body of Juno Temple in lieu of the cash they don't have until a settlement comes forth.Just like Fargo everything and anything that can go wrong does with this foolproof scheme thought of by a fool. If I had to single anyone out in the cast it's Emile Hirsch who is a degenerate and a lowlife, but still you feel a bit of sympathy for him because he's so pathetically dumb. And McConaughey in the title role will also make you take notice.Killer Joe while not as good as Fargo is still good enough to savor. I agree with another reviewer who says you will either like it or hate it, but won't be indifferent.",Killer Joe
1,Leofwine_draca,Pornography masquerading as film,3,5 November 2014,"KILLER JOE isn't a bad thriller, but in the end it turns out to be much less than the sum of its parts; a would-be thriller (based on a stage play, apparently) which tells a tawdry tale of white trash, revenge, hit men and insurance scams. It starts off with plenty of potential and builds up a great deal of suspense along the way, but at the end it reveals itself for what it is: a blatant attempt to shock and gross-out the viewer, nothing more.For KILLER JOE is a piece of sleazy pornography masquerading as art. The two, horribly extended and slow-paced set-pieces, are focused around the exploitation of women. The first is paedophilic and the second a rape act, and neither of them I wanted to watch. The way the film gloats in this misogynistic violence against women is appalling, and I wondered what the hell the previously great William Friedkin was playing at. It feels juvenile, forced, as if the material deserves better.Such depraved moments are off-set by strong production values and the admittedly effective direction of old-hand Friedkin, but there's little else of value on offer. Matthew McConaughey's hit-man is a fairly interesting character, but he's too obviously walked in from a Tarantino movie somewhere. Emile Hirsch's youthful lead is uninteresting and the actor seems way out of his depth, although the experienced Gina Gershon does better. I'm not quite sure what to make of Juno Temple's kooky turn, however.",Killer Joe
2,SnoopyStyle,William Friedkin missed it by that much,6,18 September 2013,"It's sad to see an iconic director like William Friedkin who's just missing the target. Chris (Emile Hirsch) is a petty drug dealer. He just got kicked out of his mom's home, after she stole all his drugs. The only thing he thinks of is to kill his hated mother and collect the insurance money to repay the money he owes to his supplier.He needs money to pay Killer Joe (Matthew McConaughey) to do the deed. So he got his father Ansel (Thomas Haden Church), who's divorced from his mother, to help. Only nobody has any money. They propose to pay Killer Joe after the mother's death with the insurance money that's coming to sister Dottie (Juno Temple). Killer Joe only agrees if he can take Dottie as a retainer until the insurance comes through.This movie had good potential. It certainly has the style and the atmosphere. But a few problems just stops it from being a great movie.1. Matthewe McConaughey is miscast. I get why they wanted an A-lister in the lead role. But if the point was that it would be creepy or disgusting to have sex with Killer Joe, then I don't get it. Juno Temple would be more than willing. Every hetero women would jump at the chance.2. What's in it for Sharla to let Rex have the money? It makes no sense why Sharla would go along with Rex's plan. She gives him blow jobs AND $100k. That's some woman.3. Juno Temple played Dottie as flaky. That's not enough. Hot and flaky is kryptonite to most men. She needs to be mentally retarded or else a lot of the story just don't make sense. Guys should be lined up around the trailer park for her. And if Killer Joe wants to marry her, why stop it.Other than these problems, it was strange to have that Blue Velvet final section. It seemed out of place. But it's not a deal breaker.",Killer Joe
3,Prismark10,Gunning for the law,6,5 October 2014,"This is a raw, independent film made by an Oscar winning director and adapted from a stage play.The screen story concerns a young drug dealer Chris (Emile Hirsch) in need of money hires a hit man who happens to also be a policeman Joe Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) to kill his estranged mother for her life insurance money.The proceeds will go to her daughter Dottie (Juno Temple). Chris and Dottie live basically a trailer trash lifestyle with their dad, Ansel (Thomas Haden Church) and his new wife (Gina Gershon).Joe takes a liking to Dottie but of course the plan goes awry as there is a double cross involved and Joe is smarter than everyone.The film is raw, the violence is visceral with little heart and tenderness. These are not very nice people. Some might wince at the chicken scene but the film does look too much like a stage adaptation. Its nice to see some of the actors wanting to try juicy material, away from light romantic comedies but the basic plot has been done many times, which leaves you with only a violent aftermath and the sense of dread that brings.",Killer Joe
4,nogodnomasters,ARE YOU GONNA KILL MY MOMMA?,10,13 May 2019,"The Smith family live in a panties optional trailer park. Chris (Emile Hirsch) is a young coke dealer who is in hock for $6,000 for 2 ounces that was fronted to him and apparently stolen by his mom. Okay I know that is too much for 2 oz. and no one fronts drugs, but go with it. His equally slow witted dad (Thomas Haden Church) lives there as well as his step mom (Gina Gershon). To round out the group is their dog Tebow and child-like sister Dottie (Juno Temple) who reminded me of the Hillbilly Ninja (Google it) in one scene.Chris believes his real mom, who he suspects stole from him, has a $50,000 life insurance policy and names the half witted Dottie as the beneficiary. Their plan is to hire ""Killer Joe"" (Matthew McConaughey)a Dallas detective who moonlights as a gun for hire. Without the up front money, Joe takes Dottie as a ""retainer"" to the ire of Chris who perhaps loves his sister a little too much. This provides us with a very erotic scene between Juno and McConaughey.There of course is a problem with the expected twist, and another twist thrown in just in case you thought you were clever, although there are clues that most of us would ignore. The opening sound track lets you know this is a grindhouse style movie. Plenty of sex, nudity, and bloody violence. Clearly not for everyone. Good accents.Parental Guide: F-bombs, sex, full frontal nudity (Juno Temple, Gina Gershon or body double, uncredited strippers) Blood, violence, killing, violence to women.",Killer Joe
5,kosmasp,Friedkin done did it again,10,11 November 2012,"If you worry about Matthew McConnaughey, I can assure you, this is his best effort/performance since Frailty! You might not like him for his romantic comedy movies or the fact he's using every opportunity not to wear his shirt, but this movie will open your eyes in different ways concerning this man. But he's not alone! We have a very stellar cast supporting them. Gina Gershon in her best role since Bound, Thomas Hayden Church in understatement mode. The latter does this so well, I am surprised he wasn't nominated for an Oscar.Apart from having those great actors (and a few more) totally under control and getting the best out of them, Friedkin tells an amazingly tense story. There are a few things in here, that people will be offended by (the ratings problems are just one indicator for that). But he saves the best for last. The last sequence of the movie is so perfect, it should be taken as an example at film schools. The set-up, the motivation, the drive, everything is perfect in this scene. That scene alone would've deserved this high rating. Of course it can only work, because of the build-up before. This is a masterclass in how to do it right, from one of the best living directors at the moment.",Killer Joe
6,classicsoncall,"""Is anybody gonna care if Mom's not around anymore?""",7,5 November 2018,"You'd have to go some to find a film with more low life characters than ""Killer Joe"". Every one of the principal characters demonstrate a degree of depravity in their makeup, with the story building in intensity after an insurance scam gone wrong puts out of his league Chris Smith (Emile Hirsch) in desperate straights. I got the biggest kick out of Thomas Haden Church in the story, the guy is so clueless as Chris's father Ansel that he's forced to admit at one point, ""I'm never aware"". The scheme to defraud on a double indemnity insurance policy cooked up by Ansel's wife Sharla (Gina Gershon) results in one of the more brutal and bloody beat downs one is likely to see, and Dallas police detective with a side job as hired assassin Joe Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), is more than willing to oblige. Within this maze of freak show, red neck absurdity, nubile, young Dottie Smith (Juno Temple) becomes a pawn in Killer Joe's game, handed over to him as a retainer for services performed with no cash forthcoming. Lest one consider Dottie as yet another simple minded Lolita, keep a close eye on that closing scene right after Sharla stabs Chris, followed by a bullet for both Chris and Ansel courtesy of Dottie's capable marksmanship. Right about the time when Joe's about to gush over Dottie's pregnancy, her finger slides off the trigger guard of the revolver right onto the trigger itself. If I were a betting man, I'd say Joe was about to get a taste of lead right over the closing credits.",Killer Joe
7,jboothmillard,Killer Joe,4,18 November 2012,"I saw this film in DVD retail and rental stores, but I had no idea that is was from director William Friedkin (The French Connection, The Exorcist, The Hunted), I was intrigued to see if he could make a good film that would be an improvement on the atrociously bad Bug, so I give this a chance. Basically Texan drug dealer Chris Smith (Emile Hirsch) is in considerable debt and sees the only solution is to get the insurance money for the death of his mother, whom he despises anyway, as he heard from Rex, his mother's boyfriend, that he or his sister Dottie (Juno Temple) is the beneficiary to the money, and the boyfriend also points him to the man who can do the job. Chris discusses this plan with his father Ansel (Thomas Haden Church), Ansel's wife Sharla (Gina Gershon) and sister Dottie overhear as well and have no problems with it, and they meet the man who will kill her, 'Killer Joe' Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), who is in fact a police detective, but has a side career as a professional contract killer. Killer Joe does not agree to the arrangement of taking the money from the insurance after the job is done, but he suggests a retainer until he can get his payment, he says that if he can have Dottie then he will do it, for a while Chris is completely against letting her sister be with him for anything, but he sees no choice for the money. So on the arranged night Dottie agrees to spend what she thinks is just a dinner with this stranger called Joe, slowly though he shows his true feelings for the girl, only twelve years old, and it becomes obvious that she has affection for him to, and after this he acts upon the retainer and kills Chris's mother. After the killing however, Chris is devastated that Rex tricked him into hiring Killer Joe, in fact he was the beneficiary to the life insurance, and later step-mother Sharla who was involved with Rex was in on pushing the hiring of the assassin too, and Joe himself finds out as well and kills Rex to steal the check, and meanwhile Chris tells Dottie to get packed as he knows he will be the next victim. The final scenes see Joe confront Ansel and Sharla, Ansel sits back while the killer violently hits his wife after finding out about her infidelity and the insurance plot, and when Dottie returns Joe plans to take her with him, Chris tries to shoot Joe, but Dottie gets the gun and in confusion shoots and kills her brother and mortally wounds her father, and the last moment sees her point the gun at Joe, and all she says is that she is pregnant. Also starring Marc Macaulay as Digger Soames. McConaughey certainly gives a different performance, normally he is the charming romantic or laid back kind of guy, hear he is a malicious man who will do the dirty and get the money whatever happens, Hirsch is good as the young man who is unlikely to get involved with the killer, Temple is impressive as the younger and innocent sister caught in the middle, and Gershon and Church do well as the parents who end up involved in the violence and manipulations. I can agree the shock value is a little overboard in some moments, the idea of the twelve year old girl making love is somewhat disturbing, but I found some of it fascinating as well, such as the scene where McConaughey forces Gershon to suck on a piece of Kentucky Fried Chicken implying a blowjob, the story could have had a few tweaks as well, but overall it wasn't such a terrible crime thriller. Okay!",Killer Joe
8,BA_Harrison,"A killer movie, but not for your average Joe.",8,28 March 2020,"With Killer Joe, I believe that director William Friedkin went out of his way to upset the sensibilities of as many people as possible, filling his grimy trailer-park neo-noir with thoroughly despicable characters, misogynistic sex and nudity, and brutal violence, topping the whole sordid affair off with a crazy final act that ends abruptly, leaving the viewer reeling from what they have just witnessed. I thought it was great.Emile Hirsch plays Chris, a trailer trash dope dealer who owes some very mean men a substantial amount of money. To solve his problem, Chris comes up with the idea of hiring a hit-man, Killer Joe Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), to bump off his waste-of-space mother, who holds a life insurance policy that would leave his sexy yet innocent sister Dottie (Juno Temple) $50k richer. Unable to pay Joe his fee upfront, Chris agrees to let the killer have Dottie as a 'retainer', but when the insurance scam falls through, and Chris attempts to abscond with his sister, Joe decides to teach Chris a lesson.McConaughey steals the show with his chilling turn as the cool, collected but clearly psychotic Joe, who displays little emotion as he goes about his nefarious business whilst also seducing blonde hottie Dottie. That's not to say he isn't given a run for his money by the rest of the cast, who are also excellent: Hirsch puts in one of the strongest performances of his career, Gina Gershon is great as his loathesome step-mother Sharla (who likes to walk around naked from the waist down), Temple is hot-stuff in her Lolita-esque woman-child role, and Thomas Haden Church is fun as Chris's none-too-bright father Ansel.Friedkin conducts the action with the style and panache one expects from the noir genre (even one as grubby as this), delivering lots of sassy character interaction (snappy dialogue courtesy of writer Tracy Letts), one seriously steamy sex scene, and several shocking outbursts of violence. Not one to shy away from controversy, he also includes one seriously twisted scene in which Joe forces Sharla to suck on his chicken (literally, on a piece of fried chicken, gripped between his thighs), giving the killer a truly bizarre sexual experience.Certainly not a film for everyone -- as intended, it will upset many viewers by its very nature -- but for those with a really dark sense of humour and a predilection for the seedy underbelly of life, Killer Joe will hit the spot like a crispy leg of 'Kentucky fried' washed down with a nice cold one.",Killer Joe
9,Quinoa1984,"in a nut-shell: a wild, soaked-in-gasoline-on-fire film-noir",10,19 November 2011,"This is about... hmm... about a father and son who want to kill the mother of the family to collect the insurance money from her death, and hire a killer (also a cop) who decides to take 'as a retainer' the younger sister of the family while they come up with the cash to pay him. It's always refreshing when your first though when this ends is - where did THAT come from? By far this is Matthew McConaughey's most WTF-bad-ass performance, with touches of Dennis Hopper in Blue Velvet and even Anton Chigurh. He's such a fantastic, seductive, snake-like villain here, because after the first couple of times you see him, you're not quite sure where he'll go. Friedkin takes this material into some VERY dark places (I imagine based off of the play, once again like 'Bug' from Tracy Letts), and if you aren't offended after the first ten minutes, you just gotta hang on for the rest of the ride. It's a twisted-f**k film-noir comedy of horrors where morality is so screwed that you have to laugh to not recoil from where it goes ultimately. The ending had me howling with laughter, recoiling in pain, and just stunned by McConaughey suddenly shattering an image he's built up for himself over the past fifteen years as a rom-com hack. It's his film, along with the unlikely-attractive actress Juno Temple, who has a seduction scene with 'Killer Joe' that is edge-of-your-seat. For those of us sick- bastards looking for something off the wall, it's one of the must-sees of the year. Not as surreal as Blue Velvet, but not as poorly-crafted trash as a Grindhouse movie. It's in an area somewhere in-between, and I can't wait to see it again.",Killer Joe
10,Coventry,"Meanwhile, somewhere in a Texan trailer park",7,23 April 2012,"The first and potentially most important remark I have to write about ""Killer Joe"" is that it's a film you have to allow for yourself to sink in It's been a week now since I watched it at the Brussels Festival of Fantastic Films and, although I was rather underwhelmed at first, I deliberately postponed writing my user comment simply because you immediately sense that it's a slow-brooding and nerve-tickling effort that you cannot wholeheartedly judge straight away. Perhaps I wasn't blown away initially – contrary to many other viewers judging by the other comments – but the my ultimate conclusion is nevertheless similar: ""Killer Joe"" is a very curious and deeply intriguing modern film-noir with several twisted and daring undertones, a nearly unclassifiable atmosphere and familiar actors depicting very atypical characters. The film is adapted from a stay play penned down by Tracy Letts, whose previous work ""Bug"" inspired director William Friedkin once before already, so this evidently translates itself into a handful of criteria the audience has to take into account. There will be a lot of dialog, but simultaneously a restriction on the amount of action and rather limited number of characters and set-pieces/filming locations. In return this means that, for a movie like ""Killer Joe"" to work, the dialogs have to be extremely well-written AND the performers have to depict their characters with strong conviction and confidence. Otherwise, the film has a wholesome fails miserable because you don't have the action and scenery to bring much diversion.Perhaps it wasn't fully transparent – to me, at least – when leaving the theater, but ""Killer Joe"" definitely does contain these qualities. The dialogs are terrific, while the character drawings are truly elaborated and brought in a unique fashion by the ensemble cast. And unlike as in most stage play adaptations, there's quite a lot of diversity in filming location and – especially throughout the third act – a whole lot of uncompromising violence. The plot is relatively simple and straightforward. Somewhere in a Dallas area trailer park, twenty-something lowlife Chris knocks on the caravan door of his father Ansel because his mother threw him out and stole his stash of cocaine. Chased by his creditors, he informs his father (and reluctantly also his new sexy stepmother) about his mum's life insurance in favor of his sister Dottie and puts a plan to the table to have her murdered. Chris even already knows who to engage for the dirty job; a notorious FBI agent named Joe, who moonlights as a hired killer. Joe's fee turns out to be a bit too expensive, but the rather eccentric assassin exceptionally accepts an advanced payment in the shape of a date with the innocent teenage virgin Dottie. What ensues is your average kind of predictable situations and foreseeable practical issues, but this time with very unpredictable consequences and brought by atypical characters. I can write down a whole paragraph alone on the utterly bizarre character of Joe Cooper, compellingly played by Matthew McConaughey, but it still won't suffice. I concur with whatever other reviewer who claimed that he's somewhat like a Coen brothers' protagonist, but more ""inbred"". Even though they all deliver adequate performances, I'm not 100% convinced by the Smith family members With the exception of Thomas Hayden Church, they're not enough ""white trash"" in my opinion. It was a great joy to see Gina Gershon again in a significant role and an even bigger joy to watch Juno Temple strip off all her clothes, but they are too ""clean"" to be labeled as trailer trash. Quite a lot of reviews warn for sickening violence and sequences that are hard to stomach, but I personally think that's a tab bit exaggerated. ""Killer Joe"" admittedly features some raw and explicit footage, but the most shocking and controversial elements actually lure beneath the surface. Killer Joe Cooper's sexual preferences, for instance, or the complete absence of family values within the Smith's trailer. William Friedkin was present in Brussels to introduce his newest film to a sold-out theater of avid cult fanatics. It somewhat hurts to say that he comes across as a rather unpleasant and pretentious person in real life, but hey, he undeniably remains a masterful director who delivered a few immortal classics in the 70's (""The Exorcist"", ""The French Connection""), a couple of hidden cult gems throughout the 80's and 90's (""To Live and Die in L.A."", ""Jade"") and now even some courageous experimental flicks in the new millennium. I guess that earns you the right to be mildly snobbish",Killer Joe
11,michaelRokeefe,Hard and rough redneck drama. Tense!,9,28 September 2015,"Oscar-winning director William Friedkin, who gave us THE FRENCH CONNECTION and THE EXORCIST, gives us low-brow, trailer-trash Texas as he interprets Tracy Letts' screenplay of his stage play. A young drug dealer Chris(Emile Hirsch)has really screwed-up his already hard life. This story gets darker than dark, when his only hope to pay back money for drugs is to plot killing his own mother for the insurance payout. Chris talks his good-for-nothing father Ansel(Thomas Haden Church)to agree to hire Dallas police detective Joe Cooper(Matthew McConaughey) to do the dirty work. The cop moonlights as Killer Joe and he has strict rules to adhere to. Ansel figures no love lost on his ex-wife...enter into a contract for the hit.This trashy, black comedy gets nastier, when Chris can't come up with the advance money and Killer Joe demands Chris' pretty virgin sister, Dottie(Juno Temple), as collateral. Joe's sadistic, brutal and sexual side goes on display. When the insurance money doesn't become Chris' saving grace; Joe manipulates some family carnage. You may twist and squirm and may even gag once or twice. The redneck drama becomes very disturbing with multiple sequences of brutality(some sexual).McConaughey is manic bi-polar to the max. He brings his A game and I'm learning to appreciate him more. Gina Gershon plays Anasel's wife Sharla and she is outstanding for several reasons. She almost gives as much as she gets. Miss Temple could charm ticks off a hound. I am smitten. My favorite sequence is where Joe demands Dottie to put on her new black dress. R rating earned with violence, brutality, language, nudity and debauchery.Also in the cast: Jeff Galpin, Danny Epper and Marc Macaulay.",Killer Joe
12,hitchcockthelegend,William Friedkin serves up Trailer Trash Neo-Noir with a side order of Fried Chicken.,9,28 July 2012,"Killer Joe is directed by William Friedkin and adapted to screenplay by Tracy Letts from his own play of the same name. It stars Matthew McConaughey, Emile Hirsch, Juno Temple, Thomas Haden Church and Gina Gershon. Music is scored by Tyler Bates and cinematography by Caleb Deschanel. Plot finds Hirsch as Chris Smith, who because he is in severe debt to local thugs, hatches a plan to bump off his waster of a mother and claim the life insurance. Roping in the rest of his trailer dwelling family, he hires Killer Joe (McConaughey), a cop with a sideline in murder, but the Smith's have no idea just what price they will have to pay for his services.So pulpy, so amusingly dark, Killer Joe is one of those films that will sit at the top of many film fan's best of lists for 2012. Yet if someone came up to me and declared it one of the worst then I certainly will understand. Undeniably it has no widespread appeal, you either get it or you don't, you will either laugh along with Friedkin and his dark observations or you will feel the whole thing is just too ugly to be entertainment. Man it's good to have Friedkin back pushing peoples buttons!Filmed in Texas in under three weeks, Killer Joe is a film that walks the fine line of misogyny and perversity for perversity's sake. But it never falls over that mark, even though these are scummy characters living in a scummy world, where there's sex and violence, and violent simulated sex and nudity; all of which is cloaked by a sweaty crime gone wrong caper. Much of the film is dialogue driven, rest assured this is very talky, but the director wrings out much tension and salaciousness from every character interaction, the slow-burn approach only heightening the sense of dread. When the finale comes, and it's a cracker-jack ending, there's an almost merciful release that it's all over. These are people you wouldn't want to hang out with ever, only there's Friedkin chuckling away to himself having made us spend an hour and forty minutes with this grime laden crew. If you feel like you need a bath afterwards, that's perfectly natural.Friedkin has garnered terrific performances from a top line cast. Hirsch (powder-keg), Church (naievity extraordinaire), Temple (virginal piggy in the middle) and Gershon (bold and suspicious), are all giving disturbing credibility to the material, but as good as they are they are trumped considerably by McConaughey. One of the most frustrating actors working today, much like Cage, a ream of poor movies adorn his CV, but once in a while he throws in a performance of such genuine quality that it begs to be acknowledged by his peers. Here as Killer Joe he lays on a Faust like menace, delivering his lines with clinically calm precision, yet still there's a glint in his eye, we know a black heart beats there but he can charm a snake out of its basket, a girl out of her underwear...Unflinching direction, bravura performances and neo-noir at its near best, one of the best films of 2012 so far. Well, to some of us at least.... 9/10",Killer Joe
13,Hey_Sweden,"Bloody, deranged and southern fried entertainment.",10,2 September 2013,"Absolutely riveting latter day William Friedkin, scripted by Tracy Letts based on his play. Right up front it must be said that it is NOT for everybody, or most people. It's incredibly sordid, grim, creepy entertainment with a rich variety of scummy characters. Some viewers will find it hard to stomach for a couple of reasons, starting with the fact that only one of the main characters is really worth any sympathy at all. But that doesn't change the fact that the enormous mess in which they find themselves makes for some pretty potent drama - gore, nudity, depravity, and all.Matthew McConaughey is commanding in one of his more interesting roles: ""Killer"" Joe Cooper, Texas police detective who moonlights as a murderer for hire. He's hired by Chris (Emile Hirsch), a young man who desperately needs money to pay off a gangster and who thinks that his worthless mothers' insurance policy will save his bacon. But, since he can't pay any money to Joe up front, Joe takes an unusual sort of retainer: Chris's underage sister Dottie (Juno Temple). Also involved in the untenable situation are Chris's dad Ansel (Thomas Haden Church) and stepmother Sharla (Gina Gershon).Even knowing that English actress Temple was actually in her early 20s at the time of filming doesn't make her scenes less uncomfortable. Friedkin truly goes for broke in this trailer trash tale. Things get ugly in a hurry and remain so for the duration. Friedkin and cinematographer Caleb Deschanel give the proceedings the appropriately gritty look. The cast is all excellent at playing these basically unlikable characters. The finale is particularly nasty stuff, with Joe forcing Sharla to perform a memorable act of fellatio. Anchoring the whole thing is McConaugheys' restrained, intense performance as a man whose professional, even charming exterior masks an unsettling nature.Well worth seeing for those who like their movies on the trashy side, ""Killer Joe"" does give itself away, at times, at being based on a stage version, but is visually effective enough to work on its own terms.10 out of 10.",Killer Joe
14,LeonLouisRicci,"""Lovely""",8,7 February 2013,"When Killer Joe is served a tuna casserole he says ""lovely"". When the table is set for the ""family"" dinner, he says ""lovely"". Truth be told there is nothing else in this Neo-Noir, trashy, darkly humorous, dirty, debauchery that is remotely lovely. It is just one more of the polite utterances given by the only person in the Movie with an IQ above room temperature, Killer Joe. Southern fried politeness that often hides the beast within. There is a chill to this entrée and it has an uncomfortable, lower-class setting of strip-joints, trailer-parks, and pizza-parlors. We are in a world where there is barely survival, where the folks have trouble with words and phrases and even more trouble with civilized existence.There is family abuse to the extreme, and these people are not much more than ""chained"" barking dogs trying to break loose from a terrible, unyielding, tether of unsolicited social status. The performances are excellent, if not pretty. Even Juno Temple as the cute young girl, looks worn-out, beaten down, and beyond her years. But it is Matthew McConaughey's impeccably dressed, well mannered, Killer Joe, that is the contrast to the unkempt, unwashed, red-necked hygiene on display (Dad spits on his ""living"" room floor). It is this ""Man in Black"" that these people look to for both an escape and a better life. Good Luck!As for the violence and the sex, there is really nothing on screen that hasn't come before. So all the outrage and huffing-puffing seems to stem, unwittingly, from the tone and craftsmanship from the Writer, Director, and Cinematographer. That is Artful.",Killer Joe
15,zardoz-13,"Unforgettable, Memorable, and Truly Unsavory!!!",9,3 June 2016,"""Exorcist"" director William Friedkin's ""Killer Joe"" is a strange, gory, Southern Gothic comedy of criminal errors about a dysfunctional family in Texas that will repeatedly either surprise or appall you with every turn of its twisted plot. The father and son hire a lethal Dallas detective to liquidate their estranged mother so that the trashy son won't suffer the consequences of being killed by other unsavory individuals because he didn't have enough money to pay off an ill-gotten drug debt. Matthew McConaughey portrays the eponymous but clearly amoral protagonist Joe Cooper who lacks soul as well as no qualms about anything that he does. The scene where Friedkin introduces Joe delineates the kind of person we are watching. Friedkin shows Joe putting on his Stetson, arranging his belt and gun. Emile Hirsch of ""Prince Avalanche"" plays low-lifer Mike Smith; he needs six thousand dollars to pay off a drug debt. When he approaches his trailer-trash redneck father Ansel (Thomas Hadden Church of ""Sideways"") about borrowing the loot, Ansel tells him in no uncertain terms that he doesn't have a dime. Eventually, Chris arranges a meeting with Joe at an abandoned pool hall, and Joe informs them that he will kill Chris' mother and Ansel's former wife so that they will be able to cash in a $50-thousand dollar life insurance policy. Joe Cooper stipulates that his price is $25-thousand. Eventually, the guys provide Joe with a retainer in the form of Chris' delectably young sister Dottie (June Temple of ""Atonement"") who has no qualms about having sex with Joe. Mind you, Chris helps Joe kill his mother. They drench her in beer and blow marijuana blow on her body before they blow her up in her car. Suddenly, when everything boils down to the insurance company cutting the check for the beneficiary, our characters find themselves in a terrible quandary. At this point, ""Killer Joe"" takes an incredible turn.""Killer Joe"" is not for the squeamish. The nudity, profanity, and subject matter are strong. Friedkin's film is not a lighthearted romp and may alienate spectators from the start. Indeed, when McConaughey read the screenplay initially, he found it revolting and wanted nothing to do with it. Seriously immoral and subversive things occur in this unrated epic that may appall some. The characters are largely unsympathetic. They are not the kind of people you would associate with and they are trash. The situations are dark and forbidding. The scene with the chicken leg is unforgettable. Like the chicken leg scene, most of what happens in ""Killer Joe"" will challenge you right to the core. Gina Gershon is a revelation as a two-timing wife as is Thomas Hadden Church as an idiotic husband. Ultimately, ""Killer Joe"" qualifies as a ghoulish bit of film noir.",Killer Joe
16,grantss,"Gritty, intriguing, dark, funny crime-drama",8,14 May 2016,"Gritty, intriguing, dark, funny crime-drama.Chris Smith (played by Emile Hirsch) is in a bind. He owes a loan- shark a fair bit of money, and the man has threatened to kill him if he does not produce the money within a few days. He does not have the money. He strikes upon a get-rich-quick plan: have his estranged mother killed and collect on the insurance money. He involves his father, Ansel (Thomas Haden Church), who buys into the deal for a share of the profit (him and Chris' mother are divorced and don't see eye-to-eye, so it wasn't a tough sell). Ansel then involves his 2nd wife, Sharla (Gina Gershon) and, due to her finding out about the plan, his daughter, Chris' sister, Dottie (Juno Temple). They hire a professional killer (who happens to also be a cop), ""Killer Joe"" Cooper (Matthew McConaughey). When they cannot pay him upfront, they reach an unusual deal on how to retain his services. This complicates matters, a lot.An engaging and funny yet simultaneously dark and graphic drama. Clever plot - quite solid with some great twists, double-crosses and triple-crosses. Good sub-plots and some wonderfully quirky dialogue. Tarantinoesque at times. In fact the whole movie has a Tarantino- like vibe, but not quite with the same polish and attention-to-detail that a Tarantino movie has.Ending is a bit unsatisfactory, and does negate some of the good that went before. It was heading for an even higher rating...Great performances all round. Matthew McConaughey is wonderfully cool and aloof, yet damaged, as Killer Joe. He reminded me of his performance in True Detective Season 1. Emile Hirsch, Thomas Haden Church, Juno Temple and Gino Gershon are well cast and don't put a foot wrong. Pick of the these is Juno Temple, who mixes innocence and beauty and creates a wonderful sense of mystery and ambiguity about her character.An understated, underrated gem.",Killer Joe

A nasty piece of pulp fiction neo noir at full boil with spectacular performances by the entire cast makes it all the more interesting to watch this slo-mo-train- wreck of a film (this is a compliment!) in you cannot take your eyes off the screen for one minute! White trash loser Hirsch (in a nice turn of his true talent and versatility) owing thousands (and probably his life) to a local mobster, decides to off his miserable mother for the insurance money promised to his sister, by hiring corrupt Texas detective cum hit man Killer Joe (McConaughey in a an Oscar-worthy turn in a career high turning point) whose clear-eyed sociopathic tendencies tend to get in the way of his desire to have a domestic life of some sort; to wit: in exchange for payment on his services he gets a piece of flesh in the form of Hirsch's baby-doll-shrewder-than-she-appears virgin sister (Temple in a knockout turn of a character one minute you want to strangle, the next you want to hug - no mean feat) - and even far deadlier consequences for his highly dysfunctional family. Veteran filmmaker William Friedkin pulls no punches in the unflinching violence and subject matter (arguably one of the best NC-17 films ever) nor does the tightening-of-the-screws-sadistic screenplay by Tracy Letts (who both collaborated on BUG) with a sadistic grace. Haden as the truly morale-less patriarch and dumb as dirt hick is great comic relief and Gershon, a truly underrated actress, hits an inside-the-park-home run in her nervy turn as his slattern wife and has the unfortunate job of easily the most cringe-worthy moment in the film (let's just say you'll never be able to look at a piece of Kentucky Fried Chicken the same way again) and deserves an Oscar nod for Best Supporting Actress. Again McConaughey's charismatic creep is the real deal as a villain you can't take your sights off and echoes Robert Mitchum's monster in NIGHT OF THE HUNTER.

Chris has been thrown out by his mother and is in imminent danger of being killed due to not repaying gambling debts. However, his mother's current live-in boyfriend has told Chris that she has a life insurance policy, and that Dottie is the beneficiary. He has also told him about a local police detective who carries out private killings. So they meet ""Killer"" Joe Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) and engage his services but, since they don't have the upfront fee, Joe requires a retainer, and Dottie fits the bill. Unfortunately, no-one had reckoned on just how stupid Chris is...Towards the end of this movie, I found myself thinking of it in theatrical terms as a five-hander, and it didn't really surprise me to learn from the end titles that screenwriter Tracy Letts adapted his own original play.This piece is dark and disturbing (and, at times, very funny, although the comedy is as black as it gets). There is moderate nudity, there are sexual scenes (at least one of which is distressingly almost unwatchable) and the film is violent in places, shockingly so at one point. And, although there are no huge surprises in the story, it is gripping throughout. The ending is no ending at all, really - it brings things to a conclusion (with the slightest of teases), but it works in the context of the film overall.What makes this film so gripping are the performances, which are are uniformly superb. I have long found English actress Juno Temple beguiling as she cut her teeth on lightweight froth like St Trinians, Wild Child, and Year One - here she is given something to sink those teeth into (not least of which is a Texan accent), and does so in a flawless and courageous performance (close attention to dialogue makes it clear that Dottie is an adult, not underage). Emile Hirsch, who I had previously regarded as lightweight, is excellent as the seedy, dissolute, and profoundly stupid Chris, and the always entertaining Thomas Haden Church is a likable Ansel, well out of his depth, and clearly the source of his son's intellectual shortcomings. And Gina Gershon, an actress who has seldom been given the opportunities she deserves, delivers a feisty and vinegary Sharla in a performance which is even better than her Corky in Bound. Finally, Matthew McConaughey's Joe is charismatic, reptilian, seductive, charming, and utterly cold-blooded. And I can't imagine anyone other than McConaughey playing him.This film is strong, strong stuff, but rewarding if you can stomach it.",Killer Joe
19,ferguson-6,K-Fry-C,7,5 August 2012,"Greetings again from the darkness. Every so often there's a movie that just defies description and leaves me at a loss for analysis. Initially I thought maybe I could come up with a comparison, but that has proved futile. It also falls short to imagine if David Lynch, John Waters and the Coen Brothers collaborated on a film. And then it hit me that really the most likely legacy for this movie is as a midnight movie favorite. A cult film if you will. It has the twisted humor and borderline caricature characters and enough wild scenes and bizarre lines of dialogue, that I believe the midnight crowd will embrace it wholeheartedly.The first surprise is that it's directed by 76 year old William Friedkin, who is best known for his 1970's classics The Exorcist and The French Connection. He even throws in a bit of a chase scene here just to remind of us of his timeless scene from the latter. The story is from playwright Tracy Letts who won a Pulitzer for August: Osage County. Mr. Letts took the inspiration of the story from a real cop in Florida, moved the setting to Texas for obvious reasons and then filmed in Louisiana for economical ones.The next surprise is Matthew McConaughey, who has made a career of playing Him-bo's in farcical rom-coms that seem only to exist so he can be filmed without a shirt. Here, he plays the titular Killer Joe Cooper as a fastidious, meticulous detective who runs a murder-for-hire ""business on the side"". Killer Joe has a couple of rules and demands that the details be just right before he agrees to a job. But then he bends his rules when he meets Dottie (Juno Temple), the virginal sister of Chris (Emile Hirsch) and daughter of Ansel (Thomas Haden Church). She becomes the retainer when father and son can't come up with actual money for the job.The best way to describe these people, including and especially Ansel's second wife Sharla (Gena Gershon), is they are the epitome of trailer-park hicks who are not merely dysfunctional as a family, but even moreso as human beings. They barely have money to get by in life, but it's spent on beer, cigarettes, fast food and horse racing. When a small drug deal goes bad, Chris (the scheming son) comes up with the idea of killing his mother (Ansel's ex) to collect the insurance money. A touch of Double Indemnity thrown down by the Beverly Hillbillies.So hustler son and simpleton dad hire Killer Joe for the job. Think of the plan from Blood Simple, now imagine it's carried out by the cast of Dumb and Dumber. Things go awry when Joe meets Dottie. It brings out a side of him hidden by his smooth vocals and starched black exterior. A side best compared to the sadistic nature of Dennis Hopper in Blue Velvet.No more details need be provided, just know that the story and the people are twisted and demented, and the violence and sexuality are the type that make a film tough to watch at times. That level of discomfort is assuaged by the laugh out loud moments offered by the dialogue, but merely leaves our brains desperately gasping for coherence.Clarence Carter's ""Strokin'"" is a fitting ending to the film, and be warned that while I will never view canned pumpkin the same again, that pales in comparison to what Gena Gershon must think of when someone offers her a piece of fried chicken.

View on the film:Being given a super-cool entrance that most Rock stars would dream of having,Matthew McConaugh gives an astonishing performance as the warped- Johnny Cash ""Man In Black"" Killer Joe.Destroying any sign of his Rom-Com past with a ten ton hammer, McConaugh keeps away from making Joe into a simple boogie man,to instead give the film a chillingly eerie mood,as Joe slowly transforms from being a tall dark handsome silent man,into becoming a brooding,conniving monster,who gets unwitting souls to commit insane acts,which includes a scene,that does for chicken legs what Psycho did for showers.Impressivly not being over-shadowed by McConaugh's Joe,Emile Hirsch brushes any of his pretty boy looks away by giving an edgy performance as the blood spiting Chris Smith,who along with having extremely strange ""family meetings"" with his dad, (played by a terrific,worn-down Thomas Haden Church) is also at his wits end over a debt,which he starts to suspect may only get paid off with the ultimate price.Reuinting with screenplay writer Tracy Letts,director William Friedkin gives the film an unshakable grubby atmosphere,by using the bare minimum of background music to keep the films rough,raw look feeling like a newly opened wound.With the movie being given a short'N bleak 102 minute running time,writer Tracy Letts makes every minute count by brilliantly tackling multiple genres and never making them feel out of place within the movie,Initially making the film look like a trailer park trash drama,Letts soon introduces a Gothic Horror element that gives the scenes that the Smith's share with Joe a hauntingly uneasy feeling,which eventually becomes a wonderfully wild pure Black Comedy Noir,as Letts gives the movie a fantastic down beat Noir ending featuring gallows humour,that although being pretty repulsive is something the you are unable to stop laughing it the sheer grisly nature of,until this amazing film,changes into the colour of Killer Joe's clothes,and fades to black.",Killer Joe

His Joe is the stuff of nightmares, and the scene when he is questioning Gershon (not the chicken leg scene), is some of the most intense cinema of the year.The film moves at a heady pace, and it has a brilliant, almost hilarious twist at the end.

It is difficult to believe that this was a stage play - the gore and brutality would be difficult to reproduce without CGI. But then it comes courtesy of William Friedkin who has never been know for subtlety.The story is not terribly unique: a drug dealing kid Chris(Emile Hirsch) needs money to pay off a bad gambling losses and hires a hit man who happens to also be a cop and a detective and is known only by Joe (Matthew McConaughey) to kill his degenerate mother for her life insurance money which is to go to the woman's daughter Dottie (Juno Temple) who lives with Chris' and her dad (Thomas Haden Church) and her new sleaze bucket mother (Gina Gershon). Of course it all goes terrible wrong with beatings and broken promises and retainer deals, but the whole ugly family gets it in the end with a family dinner that is unlike any ever seen in film endings.Oddly enough the cast is so fine that it makes the entire grisly mess watchable.

24,Mr-Fusion,What the hell did I just watch?,5,10 August 2013,"""Killer Joe"" is not a movie I'm particularly fond of, but two things are certain: it's both well-directed and well-acted. The characters that populate this trailer-trash crime drama are pretty despicable (except for poor Dottie, who was just tragic), but the people bringing them to life (Hirsch, Church, Gershon and -especially- McConaughey) turn in terrific performances. And a film like this benefits from a director that who doesn't pull his punches. Gershon's intro and chicken leg scenes are both attention-getters (in every sense of the word), and Friedkin likes to disarm the audience during a foreboding scene with amusing banter and dialog before -BLAM- extreme violence erupts. And it is grisly.But while ""Killer Joe"" is a movie I felt compelled to see through to the end, I didn't enjoy it. Certainly not the worst I've seen over the past few months, but it's a twisted tale I doubt I'll be revisiting in the near future. 5/10",Killer Joe
25,christopher-underwood,sensationally good start,7,7 April 2014,"I don't know why I didn't enjoy this more than I did. It seems to have all the right ingredients for a down and dirty post noir with fine performances all round and Friedkin's steady directorial hand. Actually for the most part I was engaged, even if the central premise regarding the life insurance is a little corny and the family just a little too cliché trailer trash. It is tough and it is amusing but as things proceed and begin to get a little silly it is the central performance of Matthew McConaughey, cooling pulling on and off his black leather gloves and giving his stare, that holds this together and hold you in its grip. Towards the end, things change and I can only assume this is the 'fault' of the original stage play, where the high drama might have worked better, within the film it jars and spoils the torrid but believable situation that has developed. There is little development of the characters, which is fine, but when we are asked to suddenly see things so differently, as here at the end, that lack of feeling for the characters matters a lot. So the inconclusive end is a bit of a mess, not to mention the chicken scene and in my view tends to spoil what had been a sensationally good start.",Killer Joe
26,StevePulaski,Fearless and zealous Texas noir filmmaking,9,21 December 2012,"William Friedkin's Killer Joe proclaims itself as a ""totally twisted, deep-fried Texas, redneck trailer park murder story,"" but to be fair, I'm not sure that is even an accurate summation. Prior to viewing the film, I saw it called everything from, ""sick,"" to ""wild,"" to ""weird,"" to ""creepy,"" to ""subversive,"" to ""crazy,"" to just plain awful, and the only one I can marginally agree with is ""weird."" This is one of the strangest releases of the year, but I believe ""sick"" is a huge exaggeration.I too feel the NC-17 rating this film proudly bears is a bit much. If the film lacked a full frontal Gina Gershon and Matthew McConaughey, I'm sure it would've easily obtained a strong R-rating. The MPAA's bias for sexual content over violent content is wildly known and just the fact that they oversimplify the violence in this film to ""a scene of brutality"" had me laughing. The film includes some of the most hard-hitting scenes of combat that I've seen in any other film this year, and I'd absolutely love to know just what scene the MPAA was referring to in the first place.The film centers around the family of twentysomething Chris Smith (played fantastically by Emile Hirsch, assuming the type of role he should continue to seek out), a lowlife drug dealer residing in a Texas trailer park, with his dim-witted father Ansel (Thomas Haden Church), his annoying step-mother Sharla (Gina Gershon), and mentally disabled sister Dottie (Juno Temple). Chris has plunged himself into debt with another local dealer, and consults his father about his biological mother and her $50,000 insurance payoff that would be collected by Dottie if she were to die. Chris proposes the idea to hire ""Killer"" Joe Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a sleazy cop who also works as an assassin, to kill his mother and receive a cut of the insurance money, with him, Ansel, and Sharla getting a good chunk of the profits. However, things become incredibly twisted when Killer Joe begins to fall in love with Dottie, and how the whole family begins on an even steeper downward spiral due to a colossal misunderstanding thanks to Chris.Every character in the film is despicable in their own way, either by the shameful atrocities they commit or just because of the fact that their motivation is hopelessly self-centered and shockingly shallow and inept. Thankfully, all these subhuman characters are played efficiently by first-rate performers. Emile Hirsch gives a convincing, dignified performance, in possibly one of the most confident screen roles in his adult life. Juno Temple comes off of Dirty Girl, a wonderful coming of age drama, to embody a wildly different yet extremely interesting character, seemingly taken advantage of due to her intelligence or lack thereof. And Thomas Haden Church and Gina Gershon are consistently wonderful in their roles, especially during the climatic half when they appear to be tested as actors all together. But the award-winning performance here goes to McConaughey, who is three for three this year, with roles in Bernie (another film looking to brew the idea of ""Texas noir"") and Magic Mike buoying him to an actor of near first-rate level. McConaughey's early career was plagued by a number of questionable romantic comedies and the occasional goofy action picture or two, but this year, we've seen nothing but him assuming roles of great confidence, always possessing a firmly dignified slickness and swagger that sets him apart from other actors who have just started recognizing their potential. It would appear that McConaughey just woke up one day and realized that time was fleeting and his real acting career could begin. I never thought I'd say this, but I couldn't see the role of Killer Joe being inhabited by anyone more quirky, unsettling, or thrilling as McConaughey.There's also something seriously notable about the tension director Friedkin (whose most known work would be the iconic game-changer, The Exorcist) erects during the entire course of Killer Joe. I began to notice it around twenty minutes in, when I felt that I never officially held a comfortable position in my seat, rearranging myself every few minutes. Then, during the scene where Chris is desperately trying to outrun two goons on choppers, taking backroads, alleyways, and literally anything that will get him off the track of the two bikers, I became restless and enthralled. Killer Joe provides us with warm Texas sun, and blends it elegantly with the raw thriller aspects found in a typical film noir picture. The entire climax, taking place in the trailer of the Smith family, is tense and unnerving. This is when I began to realize that this story had been a play prior to a film and that screenwriter Tracy Letts had adapted it so quaintly to film that the transformation was almost not noticeable (even if it would've been, it still wouldn't have been a thing to discourage). This is one of the first, if not the first, time I've watched a film that I didn't know was a play until later in the picture. The fact that this film confidently branches out so far past the idea of a stage-play to the point of being unrecognizable from its roots is a huge accomplishment all on its own.I close with a forewarning that while I feel that the NC-17 rating Killer Joe received is somewhat questionable, I state with caution that this is a very violent picture, with several sequences of brutality that nearly channel the lines of sadistic depravity. Friedkin, however, is sure to capture it through a lens of style, similar to how Rob Zombie beautifully captured the horrifying deeds of the three despicable murderers in The Devil's Rejects. The film's charm is indescribable and its execution, fearless and zealous, making this one of the most surprising and impressive motion pictures of this year.Starring: Emile Hirsch, Matthew McConaughey, Thomas Haden Church, Gina Gershon, and Juno Temple.

27,Red-Barracuda,Pretty uncompromising stuff from Friedkin,8,20 June 2012,"I suppose in retrospect the signs are there from the start that this is most probably not going to be a standard crime movie. Within the first couple of minutes we are presented with a pretty up close and clear view of Gina Gershon's lower undercarriage. It's not the most typical way a Hollywood movie generally kicks things off but hey I'm not really complaining, I'm just sayin'! Anyway, to get straight to the point Killer Joe is a somewhat unusual movie. It's ostensibly a neo-noir crime film with all of the usual elements – drug money, double-crosses, low-lifes, a crime boss, a femme fatale, a hit man, etc etc. However, despite all this, it doesn't really feel like a typical film of this genre. The main reason is that while the tone is pretty dark, it's also blackly comic a lot of the time. Having said all of that, it is amazingly unpleasant in its final moments, with a sequence of mind-boggling audacity involving a chicken leg. This scene is genuinely tasteless on several levels and will clearly offend some folks.But perhaps one of the most notable things about Killer Joe is the performance of Matthew McConaughey. I honestly am not even sure if I have seen this guy in any other movies before but I'm pretty sure he is usually a romantic lead. Well, in this one he plays the titular villain in a performance of cold menace. He's convincingly dangerous and gets the tone just right throughout. He is in a couple of very dark sexual scenes that are clearly far removed from the kind of stuff he is famous for; one is an uncomfortable seduction scene, and the latter is the notorious fellatio moment involving a girl he has just battered. The latter is played by Gina Gershon, in what is a pretty tough role. She attended the screening I was at, and she considered the movie a funny comedy, so fair play to her!There's no doubt about it, this is a pretty uncompromising movie that is most certainly not for everyone. If you are taking a girl on a first date may I take the liberty of suggesting you choose something else? Catch this later when you are more comfortable with each other. But seriously, it's good to see that one of the giants of the 70's, William Friedkin, is still making movies this intense. He certainly doesn't seem to have mellowed out with age and become tedious in the process. This film may be called many things but I shouldn't think boring will be one of them!",Killer Joe
28,KineticSeoul,How far would you go for fifty thousand dollars?,6,29 October 2012,"retainer This is basically a controversial movie about how a certain hick family would go to get fifty thousand dollars. And it gets messed up even more besides the plan when their daughter Dottie(Juno Temple) and a hit-man by the name of Killer Joe gets thrown into the mix. Juno Temple played the naive 12 yr old so well to the point it becomes really believable. And that includes the ex-wife of the family played by Gina Gershon. Her character as the mother is so believable. Because she just didn't seem to care much about her image but tried to get immersed as much as she can into her character. And that applies to Matthew McConaughey as well who plays Killer Joe the hit-man. The story itself is pretty bleak and simple and even though you might expect what is to come. It's how everything unveils itself is what makes this movie have tension and makes it intriguing in a controversial way. There are some parts in the movie that doesn't make much sense story wise which might take some viewers out of the movie since it tries to go in a realistic direction on how messed up the world can be. If your a viewer that is offended by some controversial messed up stuff or major stupidity factor when it comes to the family portrayed in this movie. I advise to stay away from this one. Cause the shock factor is the main theme of this movie, even though your prepared for whats to come.6.9/10",Killer Joe
29,Hellmant,Shockingly brutal and psychologically disturbing but it also hits the perfect note of comedic reality!,9,20 December 2012,"'KILLER JOE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Matthew McConaughey stars as a deranged hit-man/cop named 'Killer Joe' in this comedy/thriller directed by William Friedkin (the man behind such 70s classics as 'THE EXORCIST' and 'THE FRENCH CONNECTION'). It was written by Tracy Letts, who based the screenplay on his play of the same name. Letts also wrote the play, and the screenplay based on it, 'BUG' (a 2006 psychological thriller which Friedkin also directed). 'KILLER JOE' tells the story of a small time Texas drug dealer who devises a plan to kill his abusive alcoholic mother in order to pay off his enormous debt. He hires 'Killer Joe' to perform the task. The film also stars Emile Hirsch, Juno Temple, Thomas Haden Church and Gina Gershon. It's shockingly brutal and psychologically disturbing but it also hits the perfect note of comedic reality.Hirsch plays Chris Smith, a drug dealer in Texas who owes a lot of money to some ruthless criminals. He goes to his father, Ansel Smith (Church), for help and tells him of his plan to murder his mother (Ansel's ex-wife), who the two hate because of her alcoholic and abusive ways. Chris is under the understanding that if his mom dies she'll leave a $50,000 inheritance to his younger sister Dottie (Temple). He heard of a cop, who doubles as a contract killer named 'Killer Joe' (McConaughey), who will kill their deadbeat mom for $20,000 but first he has to convince him to forfeit his usual upfront payment (in return for a portion of the inheritance). Upon meeting the family Joe agrees to delay his fee if he can have Dottie as a 'retainer'. Dottie is sweet and naive and to the best of everyone's knowledge still a virgin. She's also oddly wise in a lot of ways too though. Things only get more complicated from there.The film was released under an NC-17 rating due to strong brutal violence and explicit sex and nudity, which Friedkin refused to edit in order to get a more commercial friendly rating. That's probably why the movie failed to make back it's $10 million budget (in indie theaters) but now has a new life on video, in unedited and R rated versions (the latter has 4 minutes removed, mostly from the climax). The movie is definitely not for the young or faint of heart but it's definitely a well made and effective film. McConaughey is outstanding as the title character and Temple is beautiful and loveably quirky in a scene stealing role as well. Friedkin's direction is spot-on and Letts' screenplay is witty and clever. What's most impressive about the film is it's ability to capture the lives of it's characters so realistically well; it's a great commentary on those living in poverty and in the trailer parks. Of course a lot of it is exaggerated and done for comedic effect but it still rings very true at the same time. If you can stand the violence the film is definitely worth watching.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XMIq71cWOY",Killer Joe

This will both satisfy the straight male porn-addicts and the pedophiles. In more than one scene, a very young character, Dottie, is shown full-frontal nude.Even though I'm not attracted to the opposite sex or younglings, that last part, the preteen nudity, worried me some until I looked up the actress playing Dottie; Juno Temple's real life age. She's a 23-year-old playing a 12-year-old.Surprisingly, she pulls it off, but it's still creepy for un-sick people.Nevertheless, the movie mirrors other amateur bad guy plots like A Simple Plan: Chris Smith (Emile Hirsch) concocts a scheme with his single-digit-IQ father (Thomas Haden Church) to murder his mother/dad's ex-wife to pay off gambling debts. Only, their deathly serious hit man, ""Killer Joe"" (Matthew McConaughey) isn't buying their pay-in-advance-of-insurance-moneys ploy. Luckily, for the father and son team, Joe wants a little taste of the underage sister of Chris, the dimwitted Dottie.We have a very bad family wanting to do very bad things with a very bad man. So, maybe this is more suited with the already used title: Very Bad Things.The movie was surprisingly directed by the very man who helmed The Exorcist and was not so shockingly based on a play by the same guy who made the almost as weird Bug. That odd mash-up should spell doom and it did in the finale. Obviously, they were trying for either the ""WTF"" climax or ""WTH"" happened, leaving it all open for discussion. Either way, it had such direction, such focus and it needed a climatic brutality to finish it all off, but, sadly, it seemed to run out of ideas and added an unwanted shock factor ending.That was a no-go. The movie had potential and a great two-thirds that I will stand behind. Enough to promote a 3/5 star rating. It's the last third that removed a potential fourth star.And if you've seen this and wondering what I'm mainly talking about without spoiling too much: Think KFC.",Killer Joe
31,Robert_duder,What the...?...what the....yah I don't know and yet I think I really liked it,8,19 December 2012,"Bizarre doesn't even scratch the surface of Killer Joe. It was the sort of film that I couldn't take my eyes off of it and yet part of that was out of sheer disgust. The film is gratuitously violent, packed with random nudity (though no actual sex scenes), there are some incredibly bizarre awkward scenes that make this unique I suppose but just downright strange. The film is way out there and it is not a surprise that it didn't really find its audience considering it would be very hard to market. It isn't that it doesn't make sense, all the pieces fall into place and the cast is really well done, some top notch performances. The story is just bizarre, way out there. Anyone looking for something dark and twisted then this is exactly what you'll want. The violence and nudity just come out of left field and smack you in the face. You're not expecting either things every time and it gets you. I suppose it leaves an impact in that way. The film will shock and disturb you and you won't be able to turn away until it's over like a bad accident.If playing white trash were an art form this cast would be true artists and I mean that as a compliment. Emile Hirsch really plays a role outside of his comfort zone. He really does a terrific job playing the redneck son of a very odd family. Juno Temple is one to watch playing an absolutely bizarre role as the childlike sister. I don't know if she is supposed to be mentally handicapped in some way or just odd but either way her childlike way makes her nudity scenes really awkward and will make you squirm. However, Temple is still good in the role. Thomas Haden Church is perfect as the backwater, blue collar father of the family. He's quiet and subtle but such an important role in the movie. Him and Hirsch are terrific opposite of each other. Gina Gershon, who I've never been a fan of absolutely nails her role as the wild and very angry step-mother Sharla. She is absolutely chaotic and commands screen presence. And finally our title character...Killer Joe is played by Matthew McConaughey with gritty, violent excellence. He has rarely played a role quite so angry and twisted. He really is a complex and terrific character. The cast is so great and the best scenes are the ones with all of them together.Legendary director William Friedkin helms one of the most bizarre and violent films I've ever seen. It sort of feels like an old 70's exploitation film at times and something that someone like Quentin Tarantino would root for. The story is simplistic enough, not even entirely original, but the cast and characters and multiple scenes will leave your eyes wide and wondering what sort of twisted universe this came from. It is easy to see how this was at one time a play by Tracy Letts who also penned the screenplay. The cast is tight knit and a good chunk of the scenes are in one or two major locations. I don't recommend this as a light Saturday evening good time but if you're a film fan and looking for something different, in the mood for a gritty dark film then you'll probably come out of Killer Joe like I did...disturbed and yet enjoyed it somehow. Guilty pleasure perhaps? 8/10",Killer Joe
32,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Very dark comedy, that doesn't pay off quite as much as it could have",7,17 December 2012,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningChris Smith (Emile Hirsch) convinces his father Ansel (Thomas Haden Church) that they should murder his mother to claim her inheritance, and informs him of the services of 'Killer' Joe Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) a police officer who runs a sideline in murder for money. But when the pay off from the deed isn't as much as they thought, and there is some dishonesty with a check, things turn even more ugly.This turbulent recession era has hit the movie business just like any other, and I think a great shoo in for a lot of these smaller, more independent films is to carry an air of controversy about them. Recent films such as Bug and The Killer Inside Me have arrived with some iffy publicity for containing one or two graphic, stomach churning moments that ultimately haven't been as memorable as the film itself. Killer Joe is the latest such entry, and, while hardly a none event all round, it still fails to leave as much of an impression as it could have.It never shakes the feeling of just being a very dark comedy all round, a horrible proposition filled with unlikable, lowlife characters all round who somehow make the film what it is. Somehow, it never really comes together as a story, lacking a solid narrative flow that holds the foundations together. In the lead, McConaughey suits the role just about, convincing as a seemingly everyday guy with an evil glint in his eye , while the supporting cast also fit the bill. Everything's in place and functioning alright, and the film probably came off as well as it could, but it can't escape it's limitations, as well as a surprise, out the blue ending where it suddenly rounds off, which may be another attempt at being edgy and subversive that ends up going over your head. ***",Killer Joe
33,bowmanblue,Will you like this? Did I?,7,1 November 2014,"I first found out about 'Killer Joe' from UK film critic Mark Kermode who said that, after watching the film, he wasn't actually sure whether he liked it or not. I was intrigued. I wondered whether you automatically knew whether you liked something or not after experiencing it. However, after viewing Killer Joe, I am also wondering whether I liked it or not.Killer Joe is about a trailer park family on the wrong side of the law in America. The son owes a lot of money to some local drug dealers and decides to have hit-man Joe Cooper (or 'Killer' as the title says) shoot her so that they can benefit from the insurance money. Definitely a film of an adult nature. For a start, it's very 'gritty.' It has many brutal beatings, murders and acts of a s*xual nature (including torture). Yet it's also strangely comic (in the darkest, blackest sense possible). You certainly get a feel for the characters, even though none of them are in any way likable.It's kind of like a window into another world. A world full of car crashes that you have to watch, but don't necessarily want to experience firsthand.Did I enjoy it? I certainly didn't turn it off. Would I want to watch it again? Maybe. In a while. Right now it's a bit too fresh in my head. I think it may warrant a second viewing, but only if I'm in the mood for something pretty dark and nasty. I can see quite a lot of people hating this for being just generally horrible. To be fair, they may have a point. This is one film that you'll either be able to stand or you won't.Those of you into 'light and fluffy' beware - you have been warned!",Killer Joe
34,g-bodyl,A Masterpiece!,10,5 February 2014,"Killer Joe is a film, an overly violent film that is not for the faint of heart or for KFC lovers. I knew the reputation of the movie before watching it, but I still wasn't prepared for what I was about to watch. This movie is incredibly violent as everyone is getting beaten at least once and is riddled with extreme sex stuff. Is this film worth the NC-17 rating? Probably not, but it's going to be the hardest R you'll most likely see.William Friedkin, who despite his age, is on top of his game here. he directs a gritty, dark thriller about one clueless, dim-witted family. 22-year-old Chris decides to hire a Dallas detective who happens to be a contract killer by night to kill his mom so he can collect her 50,000 life insurance policy to pay off his debt.2012 is known, cinema-wise, as the year Matthew McConaughey resurrected himself. He made some extremely brilliant casting choices and this film is one of them. He uses his snake-like charm and his tremendous acting skills to pull off the biggest and baddest film role of his to date. Just watch the scene with the chicken leg and you'll see why. Everyone else such as Emile Hirsch, Juno Temple, and Thomas Haden Church are all worthy of praise here.Overall, this is a complete masterpiece and something I did not expect. For a film that primarily has one location, this film is a powerful one thanks to all the talent involved. But is this a great movie? Because of the content, I don't know if it would be appropriate to say yes or no. It's definitely a skilled, powerful film and one that is rare to see these days. This film may be a little disgusting at points, but I would recommend this film not to the faint of heart though. I rate this film 10/10.",Killer Joe
35,lesleyharris30,"McConaughey is Good,but the Movie is Mediocre at Best,",5,31 December 2014,"Killer Joe is a mediocre movie with a decent storyline that definitely didn't deliver as well as it could have and a mostly average cast.There was definitely a good story here that could have made for an enjoyable crime thriller,but I think it made too many mistakes in order to do so.Matthew McConaughey is without a doubt the movies highlight and I would definitely have given this a lower rating if he wasn't in it,he delivers his lines in pure passion,and the last fifteen minutes was without a doubt some very professional acting from him,it's just a pity the rest of the cast couldn't deliver their dialogue with even half as much interest as McConaughey did.The best scenes are when we are reminded that this is a thriller,which there aren't enough of,but when we see it they are fairly intense and also quite gory,they definitely needed more of these parts because it was a bit too heavy on dialogue between characters that went on much longer than was really necessary.Killer Joe certainly has its moments and a very inspired performance from McConuaghey,but its mostly a mediocre ninety minutes that you would be better off avoiding. A man hires a dangerous hit man to kill his mother in order to collect the insurance,but the situation is a lot more complicated that he originally thought. Best Performance: Matthew McConaughey Worst Performance: Gina Gershon",Killer Joe
36,CuriosityKilledShawn,"Kill her, Joe",8,21 June 2012,"William Friedkin's career has been up and down most of his career, I guess it's because he refuses to sell-out and go commercial. His most 'Hollywood' film to date has been The Hunted, from 2003, but even that was unusually muted for a film of that type.His latest effort is yet another adaptation of a Tracy Lett's play (that's a male Tracy), after Bug in 2006, and is choc full of warped, in-your-face sexuality, bloody violence, and humor so dark only the most depraved viewers will find funny. In fact, it's more like a David Cronenberg film than Friedkin.If you've seen movies like The Acid House, or the 1998 Todd Solondz face-punch Happiness and find them amusing through the gaps in your fingers then you'll be sick enough to fully enjoy Killer Joe.Matthew McConaughey plays Joe Cooper, an unorthodox Dallas police detective who is 'hired' by petty drug dealer Emile Hirsch to whack his old lady and thus benefit from an insurance policy with his deadbeat dad (Thomas Haden Church in a wonderful performance) and virginal, oddball sister Dottie (Juno Temple). Only they cannot raise the money to pay Joe so he agrees to spend some quality time with Dottie until the policy pays off in waiver of his upfront fee.It reminded me a lot of an Oliver Stone film called U-Turn, another Texas-based psycho-sexual murder plot filled with heat-waves and perpetual distrust, but was much more enjoyable. The perverse sexuality and dark humor really appeal to a mind like mine, and McConaughey's performance atones for his crimes in various awful romcoms. Joe is a supremely weird but mesmerising character. You never really know what he's going to do next but you can still see the cogs turning as he evaluates every new plot twist. Plus it has full-frontal nudity from Gina Gershon and Juno Temple, which I absolutely do not disagree with.The film has been slapped with the dreaded NC-17 in the US, which massively limits the amount of theatres that will be showing it. But, indirectly, it will only turn it into a cult film, and thus a bigger success with its intended audience than it otherwise might have been.I highly recommend that you a part of that audience, it's as far from Hollywood as Friedkin has gotten since Cruising in 1980. Even at the age of 76, he's still on top form.Edit: I just remembered that U-Turn is actually set in Arizona.",Killer Joe

I'll deal with a shirt off scene in every movie because I like his style and his movies are entertaining. This one is no exception and may be my favorite role of his yet. He is so sadistic and evil in this but also keeps his charm so you don't fully hate him. He is both over the top and laid back. The movie itself is very very violent and bloody but I have to admit that I loved it. There is some humor in this and you laugh when you know you shouldn't but thats the sign of good humor. This is a movie that could have been one dimensional but with the cast and writing it really goes deeper and while not a movie that makes you think the whole time it does keep you guessing what will happen next.

39,sol-,Murder is never simple,7,10 April 2016,"Under pressure from loan sharks, a young gambling addict hires a crooked cop to kill his mother for the life insurance money, but nothing quite goes to plan in this engrossing drama starring Emile Hirsch and Matthew McConaughey as the gambler and cop respectively. McConaughey received a lot of praise for his performance at the time, all of which is justified. There is not a single likable character in this dark, bleak tale, however, McConaughey is always fascinating to watch, elucidating some very rigid rules of conduct and oozing danger at every turn. While he does explicitly taunt, intimidate or hurt Hirsch, unlike the loan shark and his goons, there is a constant sense that McConaughey might in fact be a more sinister and vicious character, especially as he starts making demands of Hirsch's teenage sister and begins bossing his father around. For all its virtues, the film also has a baffling black comedy streak to it, and the final twenty minutes or so are done with an uncomfortably comedic vibe. This ultimately leads to the film ending on an odd note with a sudden cut to black that leaves everything hanging. That said, the final twenty minutes are the most memorable of the movie with McConaughey completely losing the cool and calm demeanour he until then exhibited throughout; the final twenty minutes also go a long way to explaining the quizzical chicken wing promotional posters for the film.",Killer Joe
40,merklekranz,Unfocused ultra violent overkill ......,5,24 November 2018,"""Killer Joe"" unrated directors cut, is a difficult watch. True the performances are top notch. Unfortunately the direction by William Friedkin is self indulgent, and so over the top that any attempts at ""black comedy"" are swept away by his insistence to repulse the audience. There is absolutely no need to dwell on a chicken leg sucking episode. The nudity is another problem, as again the film simply seems to pile it on merely for shock purposes. Mathew McConaughey's performance might be described as an amped up Vince Vaughn's ""Lester the Molester"" from ""Clay Pigeons"". As a ""dark comedy"" ""Killer Joe"" is a total failure, because it is so mean spirited, and I mean ultra violent mean spirited. .......... MERK",Killer Joe
41,tomgillespie2002,Jet-black climax manages to cement a rather average film into the memory,6,12 November 2012,"Texan drug-dealer Chris (Emile Hirsch) lands himself in hot water, owing money to a gang of big-time criminals. After being refused money by his father Ansel (Thomas Haden Church), Chris comes up with a plot to have his mother murdered, collecting the life insurance money that he believes will pass to his sister Dottie (Juno Temple). To do the deed, they hire police detective and part-time contract killer 'Killer' Joe (Matthew McConaughey). Unable to pay his fees up front, Joe decides to take Dottie as collateral, who he asks to spend the night with, until the debt is paid.Killer Joe's poster tagline reads 'A totally twisted, deep-fried, Texas redneck trailer park murder story', and really, that's precisely what it is. The central families sheer utter repulsiveness becomes the comedy vein that prevails throughout the plot, as we are greeted by Sharla (Gina Gershon), Ansel's second wife, opening her trailer door to reveal her hairy bush to a disgusted Chris. But Chris's loud-mouthed ineptness, Ansel's zombie-like idiocy, and Sharla's blatant man-eating are neutralised by Juno Temple's strange, quirky presence, and her submissive relationship with Killer Joe that is as unsettling as it is oddly sweet. It's a quite amazing performance, and her scenes with an almost equally impressive McConaughey provide the film's highlights.If the film has a definite strong point, it is in the performances. While the aforementioned Temple and McConaughey will steal the plaudits, Haden Church's dumb, lurch-like performance reminds us why he was Oscar- nominated for the sublime Sideways (2004), providing a sympathetic character amongst Chris's waster and Sharla's trailer trash whore. It's a shame that the plot can't match the performances, and although the story takes a back-seat to the mish-mash of human monsters, this really could have been a whole lot more. This is Coen Brothers territory, taking place in that sweaty world of the Deep South, full of smoky bars, rusty trailers, cowboy hats, motorbikes and overweight, middle-aged men in vests, a modern-day noir world ripe with possibilities, one that I feel has been slightly wasted here.But if you've ever wondered if a film's climatic scene would ever involved a woman performing fellatio on a chicken drumstick, then here is your answer. Killer Joe's final frames will undoubtedly divide audiences between those who get director William Friedkin's intentions to take things to Jacobian absurdity, to those who will feel it as a silly contradiction to the film early, more subtle black humour. It's a splurge of extreme, uncomfortable violence with a sprinkling of farce, as the true psychological unbalance of Killer Joe becomes evident. Myself, I found it rather hilarious, and it managed to cement what is really an average film with only spatters of inspiration into my memory.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Killer Joe
42,Floated2,Interesting tale from a Dark Comedy,9,7 August 2014,"Killer Joe hits on all fours and delivers an interesting but twisted story. A trenchant dark comedy, a convoluted crime thriller, and a twisted imorality tale all in one, Killer Joe is one of the most brazen, unpredictable, and audacious movies in a while.From the beginning we can get a strong sense of how twisted this film can be. The plot is brilliant yet simple. Chris (Emile Hirsch) and his dad Ansel (Thomas Haden Church) hire an assassin (Matthew McConaughey) who is also a cop to kill Chris' mom, but unfortunately Ansel's wife Sharla (Gina Gershon) and Chris' sister Dottie (Juno Temple) get wind of the sleazy scheme and cause no shortage of trouble. Virtually every character besides Killer Joe (the murderer) is a walking testament to low intelligence and painfully small ambitions. Even within the grimy, sweaty, and unshowered world of Killer Joe, there's still a distinct code of semi-morality among its dingy denizens.Killer Joe keeps you on your toes throughout the film. Lead by a brilliant turn performance of Matthew McConaughey (though some have claim he a supporting character here although being the title character), Killer Joe does not feel dull and when the story unfolds, the violence and shock value come out.Ironically literate one moment and outrageously (almost satirically) violent in others, Killer Joe is a frequently shocking and casually cruel piece of neo-noir storytelling, and if it's the scummy characters who first draw you in. All of the aforementioned actors dive joyfully into this immoral morass of murder and its various complications, and the filmmakers (thank god) never feel the need to explain or apologize for their characters' plainly twisted code of morality. This is not a movie that mocks low-income trailer park dwellers; it simply drops a crazy crime story into a part of Texas that adds a lot of regional flavor to an already twisted little crime story. Of course one of the more known scenes comes towards the end where Killer Joe is force feeding Sharla with a KFC drumstick. Continued as quite disturbing but the scenes is there to bring in the twisted sense of Killer Joe's character, as it also brings in the chuckles.Although one complaint I, along with many have is the ending. It felt as if it was rushed or the directors wanted to make a complete turn for shock value. A lot happens in the final five minutes, that it becomes somewhat bizarre. From the point where we see Chris enter the house seeing Killer Joe with Ansel and Sharla (whom is beaten bloodily) at the dinner table, it becomes something. From then, we then see Killer Joe bringing out Dottie and him trying to bring peace among the family (even with what he just witnessed scenes prior). He lays out the food on the table then pretends as if nothing has happened. Suddenly we sense a change and we hear Joe confess his love to Dottie and that he has asked her to marry him, which she has agreed to. Suddenly, Chris starts to get upset, telling Dottie to pack up her things, while Joe is there telling her to stay seated. Minutes later, as she gets up from the table, Chris pulls up his handgun at directs it at Joe. A lot of chaos happens within these few minutes, which involve with all of them getting severely beaten and injured. What is then see is Joe continuously beating Chris (smashing his face), while Ansel and Sharla watch. Then as it happens, Dottie pulls out the handgun and directs aim at Chris (perhaps by accident?) and another aim and shot at Ansel. Seconds later we see a close up on Chris' face laying on the floor with a very lifeless look on his face. Dottie obviously seems confused and at the last second she declares she is pregnant (perhaps she is lying to get a reaction), then we see Joe in glee, and as this happens, we see Dottie appear to pull the trigger aiming at Joe. Seconds later we see a close up on Chris' face laying on the floor with a very lifeless look on his face. Seconds after this the film ends and sends to end credits. What we did not like it how bizarre and random the final three minutes felt. Chris dying did not feel as it should have happened, as he was one of the center characters, and especially with his sister the one to kill him.Rarely do we get films such as Killer Joe, and it is definitely not one for everyone. If you are aware of the issues brought up in the film, and it does not disturb you, take a chance to watch. It was rated NC-17 for a reason. Throw in some truly excellent work from McConaughey, Hirsch, Temple, and Church and the result is a slightly familiar yet completely unpredictable southern-fried crime story that's, somehow, one of the most original movies of the year.As a rewatch 06 28 21' Killer Joe remains one of the more overlooked films of the past decade. On a second viewing and having forgot many little details about this film, it is a very unique and intriguing tale. Highly recommend.",Killer Joe
43,johnnyboyz,"Winner winner, chicken dinner",7,26 June 2017,"There is much to admire in ""Killer Joe"", a film which depicts a number of characters ill-suited to their predicament slowly, yet surely, tightening the noose they only discover to be around their necks in the first place by the time it's too late. It is several things: a very funny black comedy; an engrossing stripped down drama portraying a family in a way that, if it was British, you would describe as ""kitchen sink""; a mobster movie; a coming of age story... There are many places wherein it feels like a Jim Thompson novel, or at least an adaptation of one of his novels.Fittingly, the film opens with a bang, and then does not really let up. Lightning cracks across a Texan sky and rain pummels down; a young man by the name of Chris Smith (Emile Hirsch) arrives at his father's trailer in the dead of night and demands everyone wake up to let him in. He's in trouble - owing a local drug cartel $5,000 because his mother, divorced from his father and living separately, lost him the cocaine he was holding for them. His father's new wife, and the little sister they have custody of named Dottie (Juno Temple), are the epitome of dysfunctional – they shout; argue and bicker. Sharla (Gina Gershon) even answers the door nude from the waist down and it is revealed through quick-fire dialogue that Chris once beat his mother up.At this crucial juncture, director William Friedkin very subtly introduces the aforementioned Dottie – somebody very physically cut off from the ensuing argumentative chaos unfolding next door. She is younger, more child-like. She has fridge magnets glued to her bedroom door which spell out her name and sleeps in a room decked out with stuffed animals clutching a cutesy snow globe. In a town of hicks; rednecks; lowlifes; loose women and grizzled men, Dottie is a photogenic blonde with an ample figure and a girlish allure. Temple plays the role in such a way that she is temptress without striking us as being some who necessarily knows what that is – her performance is subtle smiles and happy faces; snappy, friendly backchat which neither means nor infers any offence.Strapped for ideas, Chris suggests the family have his and Dottie's mother – his father's ex-wife – killed. The reason? She has a $50,000 life insurance payout in Dottie's name. This would take care of Chris' money problems and it would eradicate a member of the public who has been a thorn in the sides of everyone else. When Dottie was a baby, for instance, she tried to suffocate her with a pillow.The vehicle through which to make this a reality is the titular ""Killer"" Joe Cooper, played by Matthew McConaughey, who has come a long way from when would be ridiculed by the British press as ""Matthew Mahogany"" for yet another feature in the mould of ""Failure to Launch"" or ""Fool's Gold"". Joe is a local law enforcer in the city of Dallas, but his real paycheques seem to come from his moonlighting as a hit-man. He is both refined and calm – he's a professional dealing with amateurs and possesses his own series of principals and regulations to do with his work. Contrarily, we do not sense the Smith family have ever had a principal between them their whole lives. They meet in a disused games outlet where pool tables lie wrecked and pinball machines beyond repair – what follows will essentially come to form a series of very dangerous games, of both mind and body, involving these two parties.Friedkin does not hold back in ""Killer Joe"" – within the first ten minutes, we have had presented to us blunt female nudity from both the waist up AND down. It is often an extraordinarily violent film in places, but the very distinct atmosphere of calm and method which dominates proceedings I think merely accentuates the violence. The film somewhat effortlessly combines the best of what Tarantino and the Coens were doing around twenty years ago with the manner about which Billy Wilder's very slowly cooks the situation in his 1944 feature ""Double Indemnity"", wherein characters are allowed to come and go on the issue of ending somebody else's life for an insurance payout before snowballing into further trouble once the murder has actually happened. There is plenty to recommend in ""Killer Joe"".",Killer Joe
44,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Sick and twisted, but eerily effective",8,29 December 2012,"William Friedkin is a name you know, but not one you hear much about these days. The ""French Connection"" and ""The Exorcist"" director hasn't delivered anything of that quality since those days in the '70s, but he shows he's still a skilled and relevant filmmaker with his film version of the Tracy Letts play ""Killer Joe.""Slapped with an NC-17 for its theatrical run, ""Killer Joe"" is needless to say one of the darkest and definitely the most perverted film of 2012. There's no question of Letts' deliberate attempt to get under your skin and make you feel uncomfortable for even thinking about laughing, and Friedkin adds a dark and deeply engrossing ominous tone to the proceedings.The concept is simple almost Coen Brothers-esque stuff in that a small-time Texas family steps into morally blind territory when its members conspire to murder the mother/ex-wife and hire a detective who moonlights as a hit-man named Joe Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) to handle the dirty business. Chris (Emile Hirsch) is the son, a drug dealer who has run into debt trouble with his supplier and in need of lots of cash when he learns his mother's life insurance is valued at $50,000 and it would all fall to his younger sister, Dottie (Juno Temple). Dottie's okay with the idea of murder, as is their father Ansel (Thomas Haden Church) and his current wife Sharla (Gina Gershon), but when Joe asks for the money up front and they can't deliver, he determines the only way he'll agree to do the job is if he's given Dottie as a retainer.McConaughey, who has had a huge year in independent film, is mesmerizing as Joe, a careful man who is all about common courtesy and keeping things under control, but has deep- seated sexual perversions. He's a perfect character for McConaughey to experiment with in that he requires an actor with distinctive coolness and charisma to spare (McConaughey to a T), but the actor excels in twisting him into a dark creature who in spite of his demeanor is completely unpredictable because we know he's capable of dark things.He doesn't steal ""Killer Joe,"" however, as Temple delivers a complex performance as Dottie, who's innocent but not stupid. She's constantly being manipulated by her brother, father and step-mother, but she's not a pushover either. Despite being a victim of the story early on, she never comes across as helpless and Temple gives her that persistent degree of strength and confidence in what's a very exposed role.Even if you didn't know the film was based on a play, it has that distinct stage drama feel. There are characters central to the plot whom we basically never see and there are some lengthy scenes that put Letts' writing in the spotlight. The dialogue is straightforward, gripping and clever. Whereas many thrillers are driven by mystery or plot complexity, ""Killer Joe"" is all tension and it culminates in a riveting and unforgettable final scene.Despite the stage origins, ""Killer Joe"" works as a piece of cinema thanks to Friedkin's hand. There's ample use of symbolism and setting the stage (figuratively) in terms of tone. You have a sixth sense about what kind of a scene you're going to get (really dark, more comedic, or both) before the scene truly even begins. And as the director of ""The Exorcist,"" you bet he knows how to milk the suspense. ""Killer Joe"" will come off to many as salacious and prurient, or at the very least sick and twisted, and perhaps some of the bolder choices in this regard have no reasonable justification, but the story is actually a study of our darker inclinations. The Smith family sets a foot into that dark pond with its decision to have the mother killed, unaware of the beast they've let into their lives. From then on it becomes about who wields power and influence, be it sexual or not, and when we choose to embrace or permit deviance — and yield to that dark power.Thanks for reading!

45,Turfseer,"Perversity of amoral Texas 'trailer trash' proves darkly humorous despite nasty, unnecessary ending",6,3 February 2013,"Probably the most shocking thing about 'Killer Joe' is not its over-the-top violence (particularly toward women) but the fact that the film is based on playwright Tracy Letts' play of the same name and that he is ALSO the author of the excellent Pulitzer Prize winning drama, 'August: Osage County'. How could Letts be the author of such a superb work as 'Osage County' and also churn out such sensationalistic 'pulp fiction' as 'Killer Joe'? The gap in time probably explains it: 'Killer Joe', the stage drama was originally written in 1991 and 'Osage County' came out first in 2007. Obviously Letts has matured tremendously since the early 90s.'Killer Joe' is not without its good points. I would have to agree with critic Rex Reed's assessment that the ""uncompromising trashiness"" was ""perversely riveting, until the ending, which pours on the gore like barbecue sauce."" It's a story about a Texas 'trailer trash' family, whose amorality is unwavering. One is riveted by just how far these clueless nitwits will go as they plot the murder of one of their own.The murder plot is set in motion by Chris, who plans to pay a debt to loan shocks, by murdering his mother for her insurance money. He comes to believe, after speaking with his mother's boyfriend, Rex, that his virginal teenage sister, Dottie, will inherit the money. Joining in on the scheme is Chris' real dad, Ansel, along with his new wife, Sharla, as well as Dottie, who was abused by their mother as a child.After Chris hires a Dallas police detective, Joe Cooper (who moonlights as a contract killer), he makes it clear that he won't commit the murder without being paid first. When Chris indicates he won't be able to collect the insurance money after his mother is dead, Joe agrees to accept a 'retainer'--which happens to be Dottie. As a result Joe enters into a sexual relationship with the alluring teenager. It's perhaps at this point in the film that I began to suspect that one of director Friedkin's motives in story-telling was decidedly prurient in nature (cases in point: the obsession with Dottie's nude body and the unpleasant way in which Joe seduces Dottie; scenes in which little is done to advance the plot).After Chris has a change of heart and wants to call off the murder, Joe makes it clear that the killing has already taken place (he matter of factly shows Chris his mother's dead body in the trunk of a car, and then sets it on fire!). The plot becomes even more dark when the family realizes that gullible Chris was duped by Rex, who is the actual beneficiary of the insurance money, not Dottie.The final twist has Joe revealing that Sharla knew all along that the insurance policy was actually double ($100,000 and not $50,000, as Chris previously believed) and that Sharla was having sex with Rex and was set to share in the settlement. Friedkin, unfortunately, is not set to leave things at that. The dark comic mood of the film is lost when Joe beats Sharla to a pulp. Wait there's more! Joe simulates a scene of forced oral sex utilizing a piece of Kentucky Fried Chicken (ugh!).Without the extremely dubious scene where Joe beats up Sharla and simulates oral sex, the denouement may have been more palatable. Dottie turns the tables on both her brother and her father by shooting them. And the final scene has her finger on the trigger, ready to blast Joe to smithereens as well. It seems a fitting end to these lowlifes but what exactly is the point of all of this? 'Killer Joe' is worthwhile for its shock value; however Mr. Friedkin provides us no explication for his character's actions. He's saying, enjoy the ride as I reveal just how low these amoral lowlifes will sink. Unfortunately, at times, he reveals an unnecessary and excessively nasty side to his characters, that have no place in a narrative which is designed strictly to amuse and entertain.",Killer Joe
46,billcr12,Trailer Trash,7,20 October 2012,"A wild ride that looks like the work of Quentin Tarantino combined with David Lynch, Killer Joe is a Texas trailer trash, led by Matthew McConaughey as the title character; a red neck cop who is a paid assassin on the side. Emile Hirsch is Jim Smith, and Jim has big trouble. His mom, has found his coke and sold it, thereby causing him to owe $6,000 to some bad people who intend to kill him in two days. He comes up with the idea of hiring Joe to do away with his mother for 50,000 insurance money. His dad, Ansel(Thomas Haden Church) agrees that his ex-wife is no good, and Chris's sister, Dottie, due to a terrible childhood goes along, expecting to be the beneficiary as the result of mom's death. Killer Joe requires a deposit, and the trailer trash family has no money, and so Joey demands Dotties virginity as payment. I'll just say that the best laid plans often go awry, and that is the case here. The cast is perfect, from McConaughey's psycho cop to Church as the dim wit father of the troubled Emile Hirsch's Jim, and Juno Temple as the innocent Dottie and Gena Gershon's trashy Sharla, another victim of this sordid tale; all are a solid ensemble. I was not impressed by the ending, which disappointed me after a long build up. Overall, it is a 7/10.",Killer Joe
47,BeneCumb,Quite sophisticated stuff... The ending could have been different though,8,18 November 2012,"The relatively quiet and smooth beginning gradually develops into twisted and hectic events - not all of them shown but viewers get the information from Joe's (pleasantly performed by Matthew McConaughey) tales and remarks. Scenes linked to fried chicken seem to come from Quentin Tarantino's or Robert Rodriquez's movies; I am sure they will be parodied soon. The Academy Award winning director William Friedkin has giftedly exploited the nuances of the awkward plot - still probably not everybody's cup of tea. The cast is also evenly strong, I was most pleased with Gina Gershon and Thomas Haden Church as Sharla and Ansel, respectively, whose characters are really weird. As a stylish redneck thriller without ""normal"" characters, Killer Joe is definitely worth seeing.",Killer Joe
48,dfranzen70,Killer is a thriller,8,21 May 2015,"Chris Smith has a problem. He owes a lot of money to some bad men, his dad can't loan him the cash, and he's sort of a lowlife. So he hatches a plan to hire a guy to kill his mom so that his younger sister Dottie can get the insurance settlement. This is never a good plan in the movies, and probably not in real life, either. As you may well deduce, things do not go as planned in this excellent crime thriller from an old hand, director William Friedkin.Chris (Emile Hirsch) knows a guy who knows a guy. The second guy is Joe Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a Dallas police detective who moonlights as a hired killer. Nice work if you can get it, as they say. The intimidating Cooper lets it be known that he wants part of his fee upfront, and it's not a small amount, as a retainer. On the one hand, it's a heck of a lot smaller than the insurance payout will be. On the other hand, neither Chris, his beaten-down dad Ansel (Thomas Haden Church), nor his stepmother Sharla (Gina Gershon) has the money - they were counting on the insurance to be able to pay off Killer Joe. These people are not adept at project planning.So Joe, rather than simply walk away from a situation from which he can't really benefit, comes up with an alternative: the family will ""loan"" him Dottie (Juno Temple), a twentysomething virgin (I know, right?) who's best described as being terminally naive. Now, a normal family might reject this idea outright: What father in his right mind would let an acknowledged killer have his way with his daughter? Well, these aren't normal folks. Besides, they got a killing to attend to.As you may logically conclude, once that little line of selling out your kinfolk has been crossed, there's no turning back. We know full well we're in for a heap of double crossing. And a lot of yelling and screaming. And, as a matter of fact, blood and deadness. So although, on the surface, the plot may look like it's from a low-rent Cinemax feature, the surprising intensity and viciousness of McConaughey and the remarkable supporting cast (particularly Gershon) drive this story a long, long way. Even the writing (by Tracy Letts, who wrote the play on which the movie is based) is crisp and plausible but not overly predictable. Killer Joe is a grimy, grisly, dusty, and foul-mouthed minor classic, presided over by an unlikely bad seed: Matthew McConaughey.",Killer Joe
49,meeza,Go in for the kill!,9,1 January 2013,"Punner Joel (that would be me) is going to scribe a review of the independent movie ""Killer Joe"". It won't kill you to read it, or maybe it will if you are into eradicating puns from your vocabulary. Nevertheless, here it goes. ""Killer Joe"" is probably the most off-kilter movie you will see all year. It includes profoundly despicable characters. You will not root for any of the characters in the film to succeed; at least I didn't. It gets extremely outlandish at times. So am I informing you to kill this movie from your ""to see"" list? Not at all. I feel a bit cinematically ashamed (whatever that means) in stating this- I loved this movie! Its bravado pulsated the film to beats of quirkiness that were fun to watch, as long as you are aware that it's just a movie. ""Killer Joe"" stars Matthew McConaughey as Joe Cooper, a Texas detective who moonlights as a contract killer. Emile Hirsch co- stars as Chris Smith, a small-time drug dealer who is in a heap of trouble due to circumstances that have him owning $6,000 to a local drug mobster. Chris, who immensely despises his mother, decides to contract Joe for his killer services in order for Joe to murder Chris' mother so Chris could have a share of the $50,000 insurance money set for the primary beneficiary; who would be Chris' younger sister Dottie. Chris' obtuse father Ansel buys into the plan along with Ansel's wife Charlotte; who let's say its not such a Good Charlotte. For his services, Joe requests $25,000 upfront cash. When Chris and Ansel could not provide that, Joe decides that the only way he will take the job if he could have a retainer in substituting for the upfront payment. And that retainer happens to be the innocent but disturbed Dottie; who is young enough to probably still wear retainers. Where all of this leads to could only be experienced by taking it all in a ""Killer Joe"" viewing. Director William Friedkin does get a bit fried in several of the film's scenes; especially a chicken bone scene with Joe and Charlotte that make no bones about it has probably Colonel Sanders turning in his grave. Friedkin's daring directorial effort had a bizarre but effective connection. Letts get serious! Why? Because Tracy Letts adapted the film's screenplay from his own ""Killer Joe"" play, and Letts us know of his wild imagination. McConaughey's starring performance was masterful, along with his strong supporting work in ""Magic Mike"" & ""Bernie, Matthew has demonstrated that he has been able to branch out from his typecast romantic-comedy character entrapment. Hirsch held his own in his work as Chris, even though there was bit of exaggeration incorporated in his performance. Thomas Haden Church was adequate as Ansel, even though his performance seemed extremely similar to his Lowell character in the TV series ""Wings""; so I guess he winged it through. Gina Gershon was excellent in her work as Charlotte, and this performance can propel her back to showier roles; and I am not talking about a ""Showgirl"" comeback either. Juno Temple is not yet in the temple of top tier young actresses, but she demonstrated proficiency in her portrayal of Dottie. Be warned, ""Killer Joe"" is for an acquired taste; and many will extinguish it at midpoint or even sooner. But love it or hate it, one cannot deny it's stroke of audacity that won't kill you to acknowledge. ***** Excellent",Killer Joe
50,estebangonzalez10,Friedkin is back with another difficult and sickening film to watch,5,19 December 2012,"¨You ever hear of Joe Copper? He's a cop. A detective actually. He's got a little business on the side.¨Director William Friedkin is mostly recognized for his work in the 70's in The Exorcist and The French Connection. He hasn't had another critically acclaimed movie since then although some of his movies have received a small fan base. Killer Joe is a neo-noir film with some excellent performances from the cast that critics have enjoyed and therefore put Friedkin on the map again. His film was adapted from Tracy Letts play of the same name. Letts worked with Friedkin in 2006 in the film Bug which didn't receive too much attention. Killer Joe has made the top ten list of many critics favorite film of 2012 and I can see why. It is a very dark film, with some sadistic violence and dark humor as well. Several scenes, especially the ending, will leave you shocked and disgusted. Most critics found this film to be well crafted, but it hasn't received as much love from audiences. As much as I wanted to like this movie, I was really disappointed with it. It was just too dark and sadistic for my taste. I don't have a problem with violent films, I am a huge Tarantino fan, but this film is just an example of how difficult it really is to mix dark humor with violence, and although Tarantino makes it look really easy, it isn't because Killer Joe is proof of that. I can see why many critics liked this movie, but I can't say that I agree with them. It just wasn't my taste. What I can agree on is the performance from the cast which is truly great, but I will get to that later.The film takes place in a small Texas town where we meet a redneck family living in a trailer. Chris (Emile Hirsch), a drug dealer, has got in a fight with his mother after she stole his stash and now he is in a huge debt with some thugs. In order to pay off the debt he comes up with a plan that involves killing his mother and collecting her insurance money. Someone has told him that the insurance money would go to her younger sister, Dottie (Juno Temple) who lives with his father and step mother. Chris shows up at his father's house one night and shares the plan with him. Ansel (Thomas Haden Church) who's very naïve agrees to listen to the plan. Chris tells him about the insurance money and that he has heard of a contract killer named Joe (Matthew McConaughey) who he is planning on contacting. Together, Chris and Ansel meet up with Joe who happens to be a police detective during the day and a killer at night. He agrees to kill the mother as long as they pay him 25,000 thousand dollars up front. Since Chris doesn't have the money and can't pay him in advance, Joe decides to take innocent Dottie as his retainer. Chris and Ansel agree as well as Ansel's wife, Sharla (Gina Gershon). The family is completely dysfunctional and they make it really easy for you to believe they would accept and do such a thing. Well of course something goes wrong in the transaction and all hell breaks loose in this pulpy dark film.As good as Thomas Haden Church, Gina Gershon, Emile Hirsch, and Juno Temple are in this movie they are outshined by Matthew McConaughey's performance as this sadistic but charming detective. He is that kind of guy who on one side seems really nice and charming but on the other you know he's dangerous and won't want to mess with him. This is perhaps one of his strongest performances although I really preferred his work in Magic Mike. There is no doubt this has been a great year for him as he has received a lot of recognition for his work in these films. It was good to see Gina Gershon back in a strong role as well as it had been a long time since she could prove her artistic talents. Emile Hirsh and Thomas Haden Church are always great and have found them pretty much dependable in everything. Juno Temple perhaps gets her best role here as well. The performances were my favorite part of this movie, but I really can't say I enjoyed the story. I was shocked by several scenes and really found some difficult to watch. This isn't one of those movies I would like to watch again and I definitely wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It will not be among my favorite films of the year, and I hope to forget all about it by tomorrow. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",Killer Joe

52,NateWatchesCoolMovies,"Demented, deranged and glorious",8,14 June 2016,"William Friedkin's Killer Joe. What, oh what can I say. Upon finishing it, my friend and I shared a single silent moment of heightened horror, looked at each other and chimed ""What the fvck?!"" in unison. Now, I don't want our aghast reaction to deter you from seeing this wickedly funny black comedy, because it's really something you've never seen before. Just bring a stomach strong enough to handle dark, depraved scenes and a whole lot of greasy fried chicken that's put places where it definitely doesn't belong. Matthew McConaughey is unhinged and off the hook as 'Killer Joe' Cooper, one of his best characters in years up until that point. Joe is a very, very bad dude, a Texas police detective who moonlights as a contract killer and is just a lunatic whenever he's on either shift. Emile Hirsch plays an irresponsible young lad (a character trait that's commonplace with the folks in this film, and something of an understatement) who is several thousand dollars in debt to a charmer of a loan shark (Marc Macauley). Joe offers to help when Hirsch comes up with the brilliant plan of murdering his skank of a mom (Gina Gershon in full on sleazy slut mode). The 'plan' backfires in so many different ways that it stalls what you think is the plot, becoming an increasingly perverted series of events that culminate in the single weirdest blow job I've ever seen put to film. Joe has eyes for Hirsch's underage sister (Juno Temple, excellent as always), and worms his way into her life, as well as her bed. He claims her as collateral, and hovers over the family like some diseased arm of the law. Thomas Haden Church is hilarious as Hirsch's ne'er do well country bumpkin of a father. Poor Gershon gets it the worst from Joe, in scenes that wander off the edges of the WTF map into John Waters territory. I was surprised to learn that this was a Friedkin film, but the man seems to be the king of genre hopping these days, and it's always key to be adaptable in your work. A deep fried, thoroughly disgusting twilight zone episode of a flick that'll give the gag reflex a good workout and keep your jaw rooted to the floor during its final sequence.",Killer Joe
53,3xHCCH,McConaughey Steps Up!,6,10 January 2013,"I think Matthew McConaughey is one of those Hollywood leading men so bland I could not figure out why he is still around.

""Bernie,"" ""Magic Mike,"" ""The Paperboy"" and this one,""Killer Joe."" I just had to see it to believe it.""Killer Joe"" is set in Texas about a family of Redneck losers. A drug dealer Chris conspires with his dad Ansel and stepmother Sharla to kill his mother in order to claim her life insurance which she allegedly took out for the benefit of his sister Dottie. The gunman they hire is the titular ""Killer Joe"" (McConaughey) who charges a hefty professional fee. Matthew Mcconaughey deserves the notices he has been receiving for this performance. He is very vital here, and sinister just by his mere presence. I do not think this will really win him an Oscar, but what he does here surpasses anything he has done before in terms of acting caliber.I was surprised to learn that this was directed by William Friedkin, who is most well-known for directing ""The Exorcist"" way back 1972. This guy is already 76 years old now, but shows no inhibition with the material he can handle and execute.This is a NC-17 movie with graphic violence and frontal nudity from both female stars. However the most memorable scene would be one involving a fried chicken drumstick! You have to see it to believe it.",Killer Joe
54,TdSmth5,Few to none redeeming quality,3,9 February 2014,"Chris visits his dim-witted dad in the trailer park and shares a plan with him. Because his mom took some cocaine of his, now he owes his dealer 6k and will be killed if he doesn't come up with the money. His dad gives him the only reasonable advice in this case- skip town. Of course Chris won't, instead he proposes that they hire a detective who is also a killer for hire to kill his mother because she has a life insurance policy for 50k on Dottie's name. Dottie is Chris' slightly mentally disabled sister who lives with his dad for some reason.The dad isn't all too thrilled by the idea but Chris proposes they split the 30k remaining (after they pay off the killer) amongst Chris, that dad, and dad's girlfriend. The killer, Killer Joe, meets with them and presents his terms. He'll charge 25k in advance, no exceptions. Of course they don't have that money so after seeing Dottie and being enchanted by her innocence he suggest Dottie as a retainer. They accept.That means Dottie will have to offer her virginity to Killer Joe. Killer Joe takes advantage of her nightly. Meanwhile Chris' has second thoughts, but it's to late. The job is done. He gets also a good beating from his dealer and a final deadline. From the insurance they find out that the policy's beneficiary is the mother's boyfriend, not Dottie. Now Chris proposes that he and Dottie escape to south America. She sort of accepts. But it will have to be that night because Joe will take her with him since he's not going to get paid.Joe does some digging of his own and finds out more details about why the whole plan went wrong and confronts the family one more time. Chris arrives with a gun, they all have a nice family dinner when Chris pulls out the gun.This familiar story is packaged with a lot of violence, some nudity, and plenty of sickness and perversity. The story is good, the characters are likable despite what goes on, with the exception of Killer Joe. Everything is by the numbers with the exception of Dottie. She is the most interesting character. If you pay attention to what she says from the start, she may be disabled but her word's are prophetic.But this movie isn't about the story or characters. It's about offending the viewer and especially red-state America. Even though D.C. has pretty much wiped out that area, tolerant and progressive Hollywood's war against the voiceless disenfranchised continues with full force. So it's the setting that matters in this movie more than anything else. It features everything that Hollywood thinks is wrong with America- Texas, trailer parks, monster trucks, muffler repair shops, tuna casserole, fried chicken, trucker hats, Budweiser. And its hatred is so vicious that it overshadows whatever few redeeming qualities this movie may have.Acting overall is good with he exception of McConaughey who as always is completely off the mark. Most reviewers are in awe of his performance. I find it terrible. He acts as if he's in front of an audience instead of just acting naturally.As mentioned, the story is actually alright. But how about setting it in Beverly Hills, Palm Beach, or the Hamptons next time. Alleged bleeding-heart Hollywood liberals ought to find a way to empathize with the victims of globalization and free trade instead of demonizing them every chance they get.",Killer Joe
55,dierregi,"Think about Blue Velvet/Rossellini/Hopper, but sicker",8,9 October 2012,"As described by many, Killer Joe is a neo-noir set in Texas. For lovers of noir, it is a welcomed occurrence, because the genre is not popular. However, it definitely carries things very far. It breaks censorship's boundaries unimaginable in the 40's and pushes the limit very far even for 2012.The plot revolves around a family of dim-witted red-necks plotting a murder to collect insurance money. The key word being dim-witted. Chris (played to perfection by Hirsch) is the son, a pathetic looser who sets the plot in motion due to his debt with a drug lord. Despite his many shortcomings, I could not help feeling sorry for Chris, also because of all the beating he takes.Enter father Ansel and step-mum Sharla (some entrance she makes). They both agree with the plan to kill Chris's mum, a drunkard with an insurance policy and a boyfriend named Rex. The beneficiary of the policy is said to be daughter Dottie. Being the dumbest of the family, she is also the more dangerous, because her actions are completely unpredictable.Chris hires Killer Joe and from then on the movie takes an even darker turn, as if planning to kill one's mother is not bad enough. Joe decides to keep Dottie as a retainer, since the family cannot pay in advance for his services. This upsets Chris, who is protective towards little sister Dottie, although in a disproportionate way. After mum's been disposed off, huge trouble erupts.Without giving too much away, I would suggest keeping double indemnity in mind and not only as a reference to one of the best classic noirs ever made. Also, do not forget about Rex, those face remains unseenFor what concerns the notorious scene at the end, I never saw a drumstick used like Joe does and I hope never to see it again. As far as disturbing goes, that will be a scene difficult to top. Think about Blue Velvet/Rossellini/Hopper, but sicker.Contrary to audiences in the US, nobody left the screening room in Brussels. However, considering the level of gore reached by horror movies, I wonder why part of the audience is squeamish only about some scenes but can watch bodies being dismembered without any problem The biggest surprise of the film was McConaughey playing cool and brutal cop/hired killer Joe. I am so used seeing him playing the bland boyfriend I did not think he could be convincing. I loved the scene of Joe arrival and the watch dog shutting up, after non-stop barking. It just sets the right atmosphere without any word being spoken.So far I thought of McConaughey as an American Hugh Grant, but I honestly do not think Grant could manage anything of the sort.

Killer Joe, directed by Friedlkin and based on a Tracy Letts story/screenplay, is a fine rendition of the old player getting played murder plot. A vignette of white trash playing out some worst case scenarios with, thankfully, much more photogenic role-players.The film hangs on the roles of three central characters. The protagonist is a twenty-ish down and out loser named Chris played by Emile Hirsch. Hirsch brings a much grittier less Bohemian Johnny Depp to the table and it works here. His character is smart enough to know he's in deep and empty enough to unwittingly dig his hole ever deeper. His younger sister, Dottie, played by Juno Temple is an extremely unique character. She's both high functioning and almost mentally deficient in her total naiveté' which we are led to think is a mental quirk. She exudes a kind a helplessness with natural beauty that can draw one in. Juno Temple, a relatively new face to American audiences, is quite effective in her portrayal of this integral character. Finally, Matthew McConaughey is perfect in what is actually a supporting role in spite of being the the title character, Killer Joe. McConaughey is in his best element where he is reined in from Hollywood bombast instead dripping with a sleazy lawman/killer persona. These three characters are this movie aptly supported by Gershon's conniving Sharla and Thomas Hayden Church's witless Ansel.Killer Joe has a down and dirty indie feel which is totally right. The cinematography is immediate and not artsy in any way as if you are clearly seeing something you wish wasn't happening. The final quarter ramps up with a tour 'de force of the macabre supplied by McConaughey's character and taken home with a kind of surprise loose-end ""wham-bam"" finale.

A director that made two absolute classics when lightning struck in the right place and then figured he could get away with very competent yet completely soulless productions like ""Jade"" for the rest of his career. But then, when everyone was completely off guard, he just happened to make what I consider to be the best film of 2011. ""Killer Joe"" is a masterful grid of non-sequiturs, a movie that never gives you anything to fall back on so it can surprise you over and over and over again. The best example of that would be the fantastic and hilarious non-ending, perfectly timed and the ideal way to end this kind of movie. Because this thing is just crazy. It's a disturbing, ultra-violent, ultra-weird piece of filmmaking from yesteryear, it's a typical 70s exploitation movie that's smart enough to play it straight and not annoyingly tongue-in-cheek.

In one of the opening scenes, you are offered a super close-up of Gina Gershon's genitalia as she opens her trailer home door.

There's a good cast, with vivid characters and lots of Tarantino-style dialogue. The story is tense, with good pace and a decent twist. And there are two controversial scenes.Hard to say what went wrong. The title role is well played, but he ain't no Keitel/Hopper, so the sleazy menace doesn't come through. The character Chris is a bit off - he uses the word ""actually"", and I thought - Nah, he's not really trash.Apart from that, maybe it's a misjudgement to have the murder victim as a footnote. To have the gangsters play only one sequence.The bit that did make me laugh is also the point I realised all the characters are worthless. So maybe that's it - no love to give a foundation for the comedy. Otherwise, it's just a production that missed out on the magic.",Killer Joe
61,brando647,White Trash at it's Finest/Worst,8,5 March 2013,"I don't think I will ever view Matthew McConaughey in the same light again. I've never been a huge fan of his work, even if there are a few roles of his I enjoyed. I've just always seen him as a Hollywood pretty-boy, and his recent onslaught of romantic comedies over the past few years haven't done anything to fix that. And now, along comes KILLER JOE. McConaughey has done dramatic work before but I don't know that I have ever seen him go so dark. Maybe in FRAILTY, but I'm pretty sure this pushes him into darker territory than that movie ever did. KILLER JOE is billed as a ""dark comedy"", but I didn't quite see the comedy aspect when I first watched it. I guess it's because I was so baffled by what I'd just watched that it didn't have a chance to settle in. This movie is like a swift kick to the gut. The movie is pretty twisted and you expect some crazy happenings, but the final act just hits you hard and leaves you slack- jawed. KILLER JOE is a tale set in the deepest, worst parts of the South in a rundown trailer park where Chris Smith (Emile Hirsch) plots to murder his mother when she steals his drugs and leaves him indebted to a murderous local gangster. He convinces his dim-witted father Ansel (Thomas Hayden Church) to join him in hiring Killer Joe Cooper (McConaughey), a police officer with a nice little side business in contract killing. The plan is to murder Chris's mother and collect on her insurance settlement to pay off his debt, but Killer Joe doesn't come cheap and he demands payment up front for his services. In lieu of his $25,000 payment, Joe offers to accept a retainer in the form of Chris's apparently mentally deficient sister Dottie (Juno Temple). Arrangements are made, the plan is put in motion, and soon everything begins to crumble.I've seen that KILLER JOE is based on a stage play from Tracy Letts, and it shows. There aren't a lot of locations. Everything is shot very tight, and it's all about the characters. And that right there is the movie's greatest strength: the characters. KILLER JOE has some insane moments and brutal violence, but the majority of the movie is moments between a bizarre collection of people. Everyone in the movie is giving 110% in their performances and their characters are just so inherently evil and trashy that you can't look away. There isn't a single good person in the entire movie, with the exception of maybe Dottie. But Dottie seems so confused as she wanders through life, you never quite know if she's fully aware of what's going on. She knows her brother and father are planning to kill her mother and she casually accepts it with blissful whimsy, but she's so flighty and her head's firmly planted in the clouds that she either doesn't care what's going on around her or she's not entirely coherent of it.The rest of the cast: just plain evil. This is white trash at it's worst (finest?). Hirsch is a loud-mouth with a obvious habit of getting himself into bad situations. It just happens that his latest problem will probably be his last, if he can't pay off local mob boss Digger Soames. Chris is a quick talker and easily convinces his slow-witted father to fall into his scheme with talk of hired gun Joe Cooper. Church, as the father Ansel, is someone you can sympathize with until the end. He's just too stupid for the situation he's caught up in. He's not a man capable of thinking for himself and you start to feel bad for the guy. Start to, but never quite. He's just as selfish as the rest of them. Particularly Sharla, his latest wife, played by Gina Gershon. Sharla is pure, unadulterated trash. You know there's nothing good about her from the moment you first meet her in the opening scene. Just how horrible she is will gradually become more apparent as the plot goes deeper.And then there's the film's centerpiece: Killer Joe Cooper. I'm sure they can be little argument that this is McConaughey's best role. He plays completely against type and he does it perfectly. Joe is cold, calculating, and competent in his game. He knows what he wants and he takes it without fear. He's more than just evil, he's broken. I wouldn't be surprised to find out that Joe comes from a family just as twisted as the Smiths, which might explain his particular disgust with them. All of them except for Dottie. He finds something intriguing in her. He sees this girl has been through some sort of trauma that left her shattered, and I can't tell if he empathizes with her or if he's just turned on by it. Regardless, it's creepy.Creeped out is a pretty good way of describing how this movie might leave most people. The movie was rated NC-17 for some of the more insane moments (especially the end) and there are warnings everywhere that this is not a movie for everyone. It's got some dark laughs and cringe-worthy moments, and people with light hearts or weak stomachs might just want to steer clear. Personally, I find the movie more and more interesting every time I watch it and easily recommend it to anyone with an open mind.",Killer Joe
62,Sergeant_Tibbs,McConaughey and Temple shine in this seedy but slick piece of pulp.,7,26 June 2013,"It's been a long time since I've seen a William Friedkin movie. Long time in his filmography I mean, which is 40 years ago with The Exorcist. He seems to be a director who had two consecutive classics then faded into irrelevancy. However, I have heard of a film he did in the last 10 years called Bug, which to my knowledge, divided audiences. Here, he collaborates again with the writer in adapting a play, and at least in Killer Joe, gives it a cinematic edge that kicks the pulp writing up from being average. It's full of seedy unlikeable characters and they're in generic situations and conflicts for the pulpy writing but it's played really well, if not in a unique way. It's deliberately ridiculous and over the top at times to the point of being hilarious in a near satirical way. It's very entertaining. What transcends it from the stage is the excellent production design and cinematography, giving it a slick and rich look.However, there are some shaky moments, with the violent scenes being badly directed (never seen so many obvious pulling punches) and Thomas Hayden Church feels like he sometimes forgets he's in a film until he has a line. The plot is also slow and simple, which can drag the film down when you want it to get on with it. But it's Matthew McConaughey who impresses most with his slimy snakeline Killer Joe where you simply can't take your eyes off him. He commands the third act with a power I've never seen him achieve. Along with the cinematography, he's certainly the best part, and alleviates the flaws in the writing. There is an aesthetic in Southern stories like this that really appeals to me for some reason. It's like a modern Western with the morals of the old west and the rules of the contemporary world. I find it fascinating, maybe because it's a blend of the real relatable world and the world of the Spaghetti western. 7/10",Killer Joe
63,tomsview,Not a real killer,4,5 April 2013,"After reading the blurb on the back of the DVD, ""Killer Joe"" sounded interesting. Could this be a fresh take on a journey through admittedly familiar territory with some neat new twists? Sadly, the answer is no. My overall reaction is disappointment – not 118 minutes completely wasted but I'm left with the feeling that it should have delivered more.I can't accept that William Friedkin has outdone David Lynch in creating a movie that challenges the audience with its dark humour, offbeat insights and shock value. This film is strangely predictable despite the unresolved ending. ""Killer Joe"" ramps up the sex, violence and quirkiness, but the story is the critical factor. Set in Dallas, Chris Smith, a deeply in debt drug dealer played by Emile Hirsch, lives with his father Ansel (Thomas Haden Church), his step-mother Sharla (Gina Gershon) and his sister Dottie played by Juno Temple. Other than Dottie, the Smith's are an obnoxious bunch. Chris convinces the others to have his mother, Ansel's ex-wife, murdered by a hired killer in order to collect the insurance money. The killer they hire is Joe Cooper played by Matthew McConaughey. He agrees to do it for a fee, but as a retainer, Joe demands an affair with Dottie. Joe is psychotic and violent. He eventually honours his part of the deal but Chris and Ansel don't get the insurance money, and can't pay Joe his fee. Joe eventually tears the family apart not only through his relationship with Dottie but also by exposing Sharla's deceit. All the protagonists come together in a violent finale but with nowhere else to go, the film opts for an odd, but hardly satisfying ending. ""Killer Joe"" is not a celebration of life – dark Gothic humour maybe, but I think it falls flat under all the violence. Without the violence we are left with a slight story that smacks of things we've seen before. Not only that, but the two scenes of prolonged brutality, one where Sharla is humiliated with a piece of KFC, and the other when Joe pounds Chris's face with a can of pumpkin, seem to be inspired by ""Irreversible"", the French film that also plumbed the lower depths. As I watched those scenes in ""Killer Joe"", I couldn't help thinking that someone had taken notes in that earlier, far bleaker movie.The film just isn't as clever as it thinks it is. The actors are fine; Matthew McConaughey disturbs and menaces, it's the concept that's flawed. Violence at this level will always get attention – as do road rage videos on YouTube – but I think this story is as shallow as the characters it creates. We deserve more of a reward for staying the course – Joe doesn't get a payoff but either do we.",Killer Joe

Killer Joe is a story about Emile Hirsch who hires a killer Joe (Matthew McConaughey) to kill his mother so he can get the insurance money and pay off his debt. He involves his dad, step-mom and teenage sister who is suppose to inherit the insurance. Now the problem is they don't have money to pay ahead of time to Killer Joe, Killer Joe refuses to negotiate but once he sees His young sister he tells them to offer her to him till the payment is paid. The immoral brother & father agree and that's when the Crazy, maniac Pedophile twisted mind of Killer Joe starts. The movie is quite enjoyable as we haven't seen such immoral characters in a long time and the ending which may leaves major loopholes is shocking, regardless of that. Matthew McConaughey is superb as maniac pedophile serial killer/Cop. Emile Hirsch is superb and apparently he is made for Indi movies. Juno Temple is great, this girl is been around from a long time but haven't got her recognition. Thomas Hayden Church is really good along with Gina Gershon.In the end, Killer Joe is twisted, immoral and shockingly dark and hilarious at the same time.",Killer Joe

A clunker of a car rumbles down the road and turns into a trailer park. An under-fed dog, chained out front, barks his head off, and Chris (Emile Hirsch) is banging on the door in the pouring rain, demanding Dottie to let him in. Dottie (Juno Temple) is pretending to sleep, a desire to be innocent keeping her in bed.""Killer Joe"" is based on a play by Pulitzer Prize-winner Tracy Letts, but the imagery used by director William Friedkin suggests that it was always meant to be a film. If their names are familiar, note they previously collaborated on the film version of the play ""Bug"" (2006) a brilliant thriller. ""Killer Joe"" has been described as a dark comedy, Gothic horror, but it feels more like a classic film noir with touches of comedy and horror.Chris finally gets let in by his naked step-mother and wakes up his father, Ansel (Thomas Haden-Church), because he needs money and he has a plan on how to get it. First, he needs his father to put his pants on because where they're going, you need to wear pants. The next scene has Chris and Ansel discussing his plan in a strip club.The plan is to hire a hit-man to kill their mother/ex-wife and collect on the death insurance money. Chris already knows who to hire: Killer Joe Cooper, the cop.When we first meet Killer Joe (Matthew McConaughey), we see his trademark brown curls peeking out from beneath his black cowboy hat, pointed boots step out onto the gravel, with gun and handcuffs securely on his waist band. He is unlike any character that McConaughey has played before, because Killer Joe is a true sociopath.Dottie is the only one home when Joe arrives, and he immediately takes a fascination with her. As can be guessed, Chris doesn't have the money to actually pay Killer Joe for his services; he has to wait for the insurance check to be cut, so Joe takes a retainer for himself – Dottie.Dottie is a fascinating character. She's a teenager raised in the middle of trailer trash so she should have the maturity and experience of a woman twice her age, instead she has has sheltered herself and acts like a girl half her age. The sexuality and nudity in this film is extreme, but it can be comforting remembering that they are actors and Juno Temple is twenty-three.The actors are all fantastic. From Hirsch and Chris's stupidity, to Sharla (Gina Gershon)'s two-timing, white trash ways, to Haden Church and Ansel's disheartened acceptance of his family, to McConaughey's coldness and Joe's actions based on principle, and finally, to Temple and Dottie's perverted maturity.There are minor references to religion and coupled with some shocking violence that can make you scream in the theatre, it resembles ""Red State"" (2011). There's also a scene near the end which will probably ensure that you never eat Kentucky Fried Chicken again. But the humour fused throughout ""Killer Joe"" both advances the plot through a number of twists, and relaxes the tension to allow you to enjoy the brilliance of the film.",Killer Joe
66,proud_luddite,Very mixed,6,26 September 2020,"In Texas, an extremely dysfunctional family uses a hired killer to gain from a life insurance policy on one of its members.I'm very mixed on this film. There are times the dialogue, execution, and acting produce such an intensity, it seems superb. Particularly, Matthew McConaughey does a great job in the lead role. He can go from highly principled to very decrepit without missing a beat.The trouble is in the over-the-top violence especially at the end. One character, the son in the family, is a dreadful loser that seems always in trouble. The storyline seems to take sadistic pleasure in his troubles.This film borrows heavily from ""Fargo"" but unlike ""Fargo"", ""Killer Joe"" has no characters at all that are even slightly likeable.

Voila, You have ""Killer Joe,"" a dark, sleazy tale of sex, mayhem and murder for hire. Extremely well written, produced, directed and acted, ""Killer Joe"" is just a tad below ""Winter Bone"" as being 2011's best movie.Juno Temple stands out, in a performance that outshines Jennifer Lawrence in ""Winter's Bone,"" as ""Dotty,"" the sensuous child/woman who becomes ""Killer"" Joe's object of desire. Temple is absolutely convincing as a baby-faced, lush-bodied ""Texas Teen,"" an especially remarkable achievement for the 32 year old British actress. Matthew McConaughey delivers another outstanding performance as the title character. McConaughey's scenes with Temple should required viewing in acting and directing classes in colleges and universities, as they are as memorable as ""Bogey and Bacall"" in ""To Have and to Have Not"" Gina Gershon, Thomas Hayden Church and, to a lesser extent, Emile Hirsch are also fine.Except for two scenes, Director William Friedkin directs efficiently and effectively. One of these scenes involves a ""loose thread"" and is unnecessarily silly; the other, unfortunately, is the ending, which is surprisingly flat; though not as flat as McConaughey's big, but vastly inferior movie of 2011, ""Magic Mike.Far better paced than ""Winter's Bone,"" ""Killer Joe"" seems over in almost an instant, as virtually every scene is compelling.I give ""Killer Joe"" a ""9"" and predict, like ""Wild Things,"" it will be an instant ""cult classic,"" now that it is available on DVD.",Killer Joe
68,tbills2,Killer Joe is Killer Fun,7,20 March 2018,"That's a good review title, right?Killer Joe is so assertively ballsy with such an intense streaming focus. The character dialogue is pure genius. I had to look up who wrote this movie while watching it the first time - Tracy Letts, who also wrote the original Broadway play, Tracy, what a sick beautiful mind you have. The story is solid. The characters aren't too consistently believable, especially THChurch as the dad. I didn't know William Friedkin, and that he directed The Exorcist and The French Connection. William, what a strong versatile lens you have.Killer Joe has plenty of depraved humor, some very gruesome violence, and lots of gratuitous nudity.The Depraved Humor---> ""I heard y'all talking about killing Momma. I think it's a good idea.""/""Aren't you s'posed to arrest people who commit murder?"" ""I like Digger.""/""You're a very, beautiful woman. Don't you think so, Ansel?"" ""I hadn't given it much thought."" - that last line is really funny.The Gruesome Violence---> the end, and really, only the end.The Gratuitous Nudity---> Gina Gershon opens the god damn door 100% bottomless, hairy crotch and all - that scene's really funny./A couple strippers show their fake boobies on stage, Texas style/Juno Temple wears provocative clothing throughout and Juno Temple takes off a number of the provocative clothing she wears throughout, and stands full frontal, a lot./Matthew McConaughey aggressively pins Emile Hirsch armed and fully naked then peacefully walks away - that's so funny, so creepy.The Juno Temple Paragraph - : ) She is so sweet, oh my god. I'm in love. She's beautiful. She's funny. She's really a talented girl. The best thing about her is...her sweet personality. Juno is around 20 when she did this. She's definitely not 12. I love her.The Matthew McConaughey Emile Hirsch Gina Gershon Thomas Haden Church Paragraph - McConaughey approaches Killer Joe with just the right mindset but not the right attitude. He's underwhelming at times. Thomas Haden Church way moreso. Gershon is all-around awesome. Emile by far gives the best performance.Having mentioned the nudity, violence, and dark humor, it also warrants to be stated that Killer Joe is very plainly disturbing. Obviously.

He ain't the blue eyed hero or the RomCom interest as his main part in this dark film noir.Based in the American South, we have one dysfunctional family who are plotting to kill the mother for the insurance money. Into this they call in 'Killer Joe' to do the job.It's a nasty movie, and treats the characters like trash. A very cynical outlook on humanity and you may not stomach all that happens. The sexual politics aren't going to please many people, and it is a discomforting film.Yet it is still very well written, and uncomfortably involving. The acting is top notch and the pace is well done with good twists.Before you watch it, if you've not got a strong stomach for films, then approach this one with caution. Not one for everyone, but still a very good film.",Killer Joe
70,itamarscomix,Trailer Trash Noir,7,17 December 2012,"Probably the best thing I can say about Killer Joe is that it's memorable, and that's nothing to be taken too lightly: this film is a true original, it has style, it has wit, it cleverly juggles genres and it sticks to the viewer's mind. William Friedkin (The French Connection, The Exorcist, Rules of Engagement) was always a solid director working within genres, not one who breaks molds; in Killer Joe he's more daring, more stylish and more wicked than I've ever seen him before.Killer Joe is far from perfect, though. A lot has been said about Matthew McConaughey's performance - there's no doubt that it's a gutsy one and I applaud McConaughey for stepping out of the comfort zone of his rom-com typecast, but I really don't think he has the depth to pull off Joe's character, and when he plays a psychopathic killer I feel like he's imitating other actors playing psychopaths in movies he saw, and he doesn't sell it, which drains the film of a lot of the power it could have had, with a more competent actor in the lead. Some of the other actors pull their weight, though - in particular, Thomas Haden Church, Juno Temple and Gina Gershon all deliver wonderful performances which give their relatively minor characters a lot more depth than the script gives them.McConaughey's acting isn't the only thing to keep Killer Joe from greatness, though; Friedkin juggles genres impressively, but it doesn't always work quite the way he intended it. Especially some of the more shocking scenes in the second half feel like they're trying too hard to shock, to the point that they wind up more funny than shocking and take the wind out of the more humorous scenes. The film, as a whole, suffers from lack of balance and focus and a general inconsistency. But even if the viewers can't always be sure if they're watching intelligent camp or just pure trash, they're always invested and always interested, and they're still wondering what they saw a long time after the film is over. It's not perfect and it may not be everyone's cup of tea but it should definitely be watched.",Killer Joe

I was surprised by Matthew McConaughey's dark character towards the end; it's not something I thought he'd be comfortable pulling off. There was no need to make the film NC-17, though, but the MPAA, being the prudes they are, saw fit to label it as such anyway. There was no explicit sex after all, merely suggested. Anyway, it is what it is: a redneck crime flick set in ass-backwards Texas. Enjoy.",Killer Joe

I watched it this morning, and was so engrossed by it, it's near two hours running time ran mighty quick. Matthew McConaughey is so capable of playing bad well. Here, he's dirty cop/killer Joe, is someone you sure as hell don't want to mess with. He has a nervous habit too, stereotyped in so many other movies, heard right at it's start. Joe kills people for a price. Running from debt collectors, who you sure as hell, wouldn't want to get worked over by, as owing a real big figure, Chris (Emile Hirsch) calls in Joe to do a job that will get him out of this rut. His evil mother, who in the eyes of all her family is better off dead, has a life insurance policy worth fifty thousand. As not being able to come up with the moola, right away, to pay Joe for the hit, Joe throws an option their way-a sexual exchange to bed Chris's hot younger sister (Juno Temple), who quite sizzles on the screen mind you, in a blue top or formal black dress. The relationship between her and Joe becomes more intense, leaving a real wanting for him, (sick huh) regardless of her older brother's disapproval. We come to learn more about this psycho, magnificently played by an actor you don't want to estimate in these type of roles, if that terrible 4th Chainsaw movie was any indication. Here's a really dangerous, dangerous man, and as the film progresses, we really see what he's capable of, in one elongated scene played out to the end, that could have you turning off KFC forever. This interesting film noir thriller is something different, with a great story catch, and some real top notch acting by all, that fails to disappoint, specially Temple and Thomas Haden Church. But of course, McConaughey owns the film, 100 percent believable, in his role. We also see a heavier, chunkier looking Gina 'Showgirls' Gershon, an always impressive actress, and I'm not writing out her performance in that so called '95' fizzer either.

73,rubenm,Stylish neo-noir,7,6 November 2012,"This movie is: violent, bizarre, shocking, stylish, over the top, extraordinary. This movie is not: average, politically correct, subtle, dull, realistic. So, there it is. You love 'Killer Joe' or you hate it. I can imagine people leaving the cinema disgusted after having watched it, and I can imagine people wanting to see it again immediately. It is about low-life people wanting to kill their own mother, about trailer trash without any moral value, about a family that only communicates by shouting and cursing, about extreme violence and cheap sex. 'Killer Joe' is a film noir in almost every aspect. The characters are cliché's: the cool contract killer in black clothes, the sleazy adulterous wife, the femme fatale who causes the downfall of the lead character. In this particular film, the femme fatale part is slightly different from the usual bombshell: she is an underage Lolita-like girl, who is sensual and innocent at the same time. This girl, Dottie, is played with absolute perfection by Juno Temple. The movie is not to be taken too seriously. In the second half, the scenes get more and more bizarre, including the final shootout, the surprising last words and the more or less open end. I think the audience shouldn't take the violence too seriously either. There is a lot of very graphic violence, which could put viewers off. But it's meant as an integral part of a neo- noir movie that doesn't shy away from anything. By the way, there is a lot of nudity as well (at least for an American film), including a full frontal nude shot of a supposedly underage girl. There are some flaws in this movie. Some scenes are completely over the top. At one point, you think you're watching a more or less serious thriller, but then you get some Tarantino- esque scenes that make the whole thing a bit unbalanced. Also, there are serious plot holes. How Killer Joe discovers the truth about who is double-crossing who, remains unclear.",Killer Joe

Just as Joe is about to leave, he spots Dottie (Temple), Chris' innocent younger sister. Joe makes Chris an offer, he'll keep Dottie as sexual collateral until the money is collected and his fee can be paid.Has I said in my Bernie review, 2011 was the biggest come back for Matthew McConaughey and in this movie he once again brings it his all and that's what I like to see from him. I learned today that actors can start off in bad movies or mediocre films and it may take a while to get their fame and real talent on the big screen, but sooner or late it will come to them and it will be worth the wait.The director of the film ""William Friedkin"", he's well know for The French Connection and The Exorcist, and now we got Killer Joe and to me he's still got it and he still knows how to directed a film, because he directed this movie in a style that suits the tone of the film.Matthew McConaughey was fan freaking tastic in this movie. The rest of the cast did a fine job, the writing was good, the score was nice to listen to.The movie is supposed to be a dark comedy, but as I said at the beginning of the review: ""I only got the dark parts and not much of the comedy"", and that's the biggest nick pick with the movie and didn't find it funny. But they was this one part were McConaughey puts a peace of fried chicken between his legs and makes a women suck the fried chicken like she was giving him a blow job and that scene to me kind of made me laugh, because of how silly and ridiculous it was.

77,pfgpowell-1,"Pretty bloody odd, not exactly bad, but very odd: what's it about?",5,17 July 2015,"This is something of an admission, but here goes: what the hell was that all about? Someone tell my because I haven't a clue. It's entertaining enough, in that it carries you along with it, and this viewer (who not an hour earlier gave up on a film after 30 minutes which was dire and had no sign of ever getting better) was with it to the end.But I did expect something, some hint, as to - well, what? Maybe I should try it from some other angle: why did Tracy Letts write the play on which it is based and on which he based his screenplay, and what persuaded William Friedkin to direct it? That last comment sounds negative. It sounds that I think Killer Joe is in some way bad and that Friedkin should have left it well alone. I don't mean that, either.There's the nub of the problem: what, exactly was the point of it all? I'm never one to provide a synopsis and try to palm it off as a review, but in this case a little background is, perhaps, necessary.At the heart of it is a dysfunctional family, three of whom give stupidity a bad name. The fourth is also pretty dumb, but at least tries to be clever. Then there's McConaughey's Killer Joe, a cop who is also a freelance killer, hired to kill the first wife of the paterfamilias so the family can clean up on the woman's life insurance policy. In brief, it all goes haywire.Elsewhere this has been called 'a black comedy', but I don't quite see it if it was intended as such. I suspect I might have picked up on that had that been the case. But if not a black comedy - well, what? In this instance I would urge the curious to give it a whirl and see whether they can make head or tail of the film. But be warned: there are scenes of graphic violence and some gruesome quasi sex. Good luck.

The MPAA (the US equivalent of the BBFC) is a sinister and hallowed organisation; one which outrageously slapped the same rating on Steve McQueen's Shame earlier this year - except here the certificate is justified, perhaps even necessary to the purpose of (play and screenwriter) Tracy Letts and (director) William Friedkin.The amusingly convoluted, noirish plot concerns a boy, Chris (Emile Hirsch), who seeks to raise the money he owes to the local gang boss by hiring a hit-man (Matthew McConaughey in the title role) to knock off his absent mother and claiming the insurance. The catch is that the money will go to Chris's sister, Dottie (Juno Temple) - so aside from the race for the cash there is also the race to capture the innocent recipient's affections. It's no spoiler to reveal that it all ends in a bizarre bloodbath.The film could almost function as a prequel to Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. The film similarly feasts on our fear of the apocalyptically dysfunctional family unit, and then doubling the fear by depicting that family as one with a kind grim, self-sustaining resolve. Killer Joe himself is the black mass (and he does wear a lot of black) at the heart of the familial entity; a force of nature which both binds and explodes the group. He arranges their lives, directing dinner and removing the distraction of TV. But he is also the thief who threatens to lead Dottie away, inspiring in her a sense of free will and wanderlust that threatens to put an end to the perpetual domestic chaos.William Friedkin (The Exorcist, The French Connection, Jade) is approaching 80 years old, so it is invigorating to see him grow old with indignity. Like the best confrontational cinema, the most telling part is the reaction rather than the thing itself. The ""chicken drumstick scene"" gets all the headlines, but an earlier scene, in which Joe claims the human prize bestowed him by Dottie's father (a hilariously bawdy Thomas Haden Church), is far more disturbing and scary. I think Friedkin is challenging us to confront our sense of taboo. How much of what we find objectionable is decided by social assumptions, how much by simple physical repulsion, and how much by real empathy with our fellow human beings?McConaughey's performance is not revelatory - he's always been a capable actor who makes up for a narrowness of range with presence and uncelebrated subtlety. It's tempting to say that Temple's turn is a star-making one, but I'm not sure that happens overnight, so let's just enjoy a rare, courageous performance of emotional (and physical) violence and depth.Friedkin's film does no favours to the tried, tested and unfortunately trusted trailer community stereotypes. It's not easy viewing, and if you're not attuned to its bluntly ironic, Cronenbergian sense of mutated reality then you'll probably spew into your popcorn. But if you surrender, and you are willing to enter the claustrophobic, self- contained Petri dish, then you'll discover one of the wittier and more thought-provoking films of 2012 so far.",Killer Joe
79,cat_ranchero,Cool but very violent...,8,11 August 2013,"Because it's based on a play the action does all seem to occur in one place; predominantly the Smith family trailer. I didn't find this too distracting but I did find it a little claustrophobic at times. All of the performances were truly excellent but I have to say the critics were right; Matthew McConaughey really does stand out in this one. There are some really violent scenes in this one so I definitely wouldn't recommend it for younger viewers; the 18 Certificate is definitely more than a guideline here. I really liked the underlying dark humour throughout; it gave the narrative a little more interest. Over all, an interesting watch with some nice touches; it doesn't have any particularly stunning effects but it's a well crafted character-driven piece.

80,dvc5159,A ticker on a powder keg,8,30 August 2012,"Renowned director William Friedkin's (""The Exorcist"", ""The French Connection"") take on Tracy Letts' screen/play ""Killer Joe"" is a timebomb of a movie. It makes no apologies for being voyeuristic, perverted, gritty, vulgar, stupid, hilarious, disgusting and insane. This is Friedkin firing on all cylinders and proof that he has not lost his touch to grip and shock the audience.Every character in this movie is stupid, depraved or sometimes both. Letts is no stranger to insanity as proved with his previous collaboration with Friedkin (the overlooked ""Bug""). Here the entire Smith family is so morally depraved and Killer Joe so sadistically cruel and calm, humanity may be questioned altogether.Matthew McConaughey gives the performance of a lifetime here. His strikingly handsome good looks and calm persona are put into perfect use here as the titular Killer Joe. As the film progresses, Joe transforms from a charming, smooth talking mystery into a perverted, depraved and sadistically cruel being, with McConaughey reaching depths that hadn't been thought possible. It is a brilliant, terrific performance, and let's hope it isn't the last one from him. Emile Hirsch can play desperate and dumb very well, Gina Gershon was cringingly good as the b- word of a stepmother, Thomas Haden Church convincing as the dumb yet resigned/given-up father, and Juno Temple's portrayal of the not-right- in-the-head sister is perfect considering the movie's atmosphere.Like ""Bug"", ""Killer Joe"" is based on a play, and on film it feels like one too - not necessarily a bad thing. However, Fredkin's direction hits out of the ballpark - the whole atmosphere of the movie can be summed up when Gershon's stepmother character opens the door for the stepson in the opening scene. Friedkin makes sure to make the audience feel as uncomfortable and unsettling as possible as these people do as many wrong, increasingly pathetic, and often extremely shocking things. Friedkin's leering, voyeuristic direction of scenes with Dottie borders on fetishism, possibly even topping it - and a scene involving fried chicken and canned food which left me slack-jawed.Do I need recommend this film? It's depraved and morally reprehensive, but it is not torture porn. It is about a horrible family and a horrible man doing progressively horrible things. If that's what you're looking for, you got it. I didn't hate the film either. I laughed at the many black comedy throughout the film. I was engaged, nay, thrilled at McConaughey's performance - and Friedkin's show-stopping direction. ""Killer Joe"" is a film that will remain for a long while in the mind after viewing. Especially the riveting, lunatic ending.Overall rating: Between 82% - 86%",Killer Joe
81,doug_park2001,Some Good Acting and Dialogue Here,4,18 March 2013,"It's also well-produced and kept me watching (even though I now wish I hadn't bothered). Those are all the positive things that I can say about KILLER JOE.The storyline and pacing are both terrible, with no real surprises, long scenes of a charismatic but morally bankrupt cop who sides as a hit-man getting raunchy with teenaged Dottie--Is she really supposed to be 12?!--and at least 10 full minutes devoted to showing people getting their faces punched in and the after-effects of same. KILLER JOE shows no compassion towards ANY of its characters, not even poor Dottie.I don't care what Roger Ebert said. ""Noir"" should not be used as a cover for just plain sick and pointless. I kept watching mainly because I hoped for some hint of justice or satisfaction at the end. Even when there is no real resolution, there should at least be some indication of either change or continuity. Most contemporary noir films have something along these lines, as do, for that matter, films by King of Sleaze John Waters or the excellent forerunner of many of today's noir thrillers, FREEWAY. Point made, I suppose: KILLER JOE ends badly.A few other random observations: --In the Special Features, Tracy Letts (sceenwriter and author of the original play, KILLER JOE) says something to this effect: ""I just wanted to show the pent-up rage inside all these characters."" To a certain extent, I guess he succeeds there.--Much of KILLER JOE's motivation appears to be satirization of ""trailer trash"" people, the City of Dallas, and the entire State of Texas. Yet, it never gets beyond the usual stereotypes, nor does it offer anything that hasn't been done a gazillion times before. Tiresome.--SPOILER ALERT: While it's understood that he wanted it found quickly, that's a very unlikely (and rather foolish) way for an expert hit-man to dispose of a body.",Killer Joe
82,ragingbull_2005,Truly a killer,8,17 October 2012,"Watching Matthew McConaughey essay the titular role with perfection is like a sucker punch to your guts because of the violence and brutality he indulges in. the viewer will relish his performance because it is enacted with such great style. He is a police detective who has been hired by Emile Hirsch to kill his mother and collect her insurance to pay off his gambling debts. The story is straight but the treatment by William Friedkin, the maker of classics like The Exorcist and The French Connection, is refreshing. The violence is in your face and seldom off camera. There is a scene involving a chicken leg piece which will make your stomach churn. This was awarded the NC 17 rating which is seldom given to even the most explicit of movies so those who cannot stomach brutality should stay away. the rest should enjoy this fantastic piece of movie making. The characters are among the most memorable you will see this year. Highly recommended. 4 out of 5 for the Joe. He is truly a killer.

84,Chris_Pandolfi,Southern Fried Violence,7,9 August 2012,"William Friedkin's ""Killer Joe"" is the kind of film where you don't know whether to appreciate it for its audacity or condemn it for its perversity. I suspect most audiences will go both ways on it, not just while it's playing but long after they have left the theater. Exactly how is one supposed to respond to a scene where fellatio is performed on a fried chicken drumstick by a woman whose nose has been broken and has blood smeared all over her face? Here is a film that's intended to make you laugh one minute and get your skin crawling the next; love it, hate it, or both, there's no denying the skill that went into it, from the spot-on casting to the impeccable performances to the uncompromising use of dark humor and cringe-inducing depictions of violence. Let it not be said that this film doesn't earn every bit of its NC-17 rating.As was the case with Friedkin's previous film, the merciless paranoia thriller ""Bug,"" it has been adapted by Tracy Letts from his own stage play – and I have to admit, it's very difficult for me to imagine how this story could ever have been told through the medium of live theater. It takes place in an unspecified area just outside of Dallas, Texas, where it seems lightning storms and rain are nightly occurrences. At the heart of the plot is the Smith family, each and every member a real piece of work. The son, Chris (Emile Hirsch), is in a serious pickle because he doesn't have the cash to pay off an outstanding debt to the drug dealers who are looking to kill him; he goes to his father, Ansel (Thomas Haden Church), with the idea of having his mother, who also happens to be Ansel's ex-wife, murdered so that they can collect the insurance money.We never actually meet the intended victim, but on the basis of how she's described all throughout the film, it would seem she's an awful person the world would be better off without. Perhaps Chris and Ansel are right about her, and perhaps they aren't. All we do know is that we get to know both of them quite well, and to be perfectly frank, they're status as human beings is open for debate. Rather than do the deed themselves, they hire a contract killer named Joe Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), who's also a police detective, and by all accounts a highly respected one. He's a cold, calculating man – handsome, a smooth talker, not necessarily without some charm, and always in control of the situation. For obvious legal reasons, he remains rather hush-hush about his methods. But when it comes to his fee, which is naturally nonnegotiable, he's all specifics.He demands, for example, that he claim something or someone as a retainer until the insurance comes through. Here enters Chris' teenage sister, the simple, soft-spoken, easily charmed Dottie (Juno Temple). She overhears Chris and Ansel conspiring, and she agrees that killing her mother would be a good idea. Not long after, she meets Joe, who so thoroughly uses her naivety to his advantage that we're torn between admiring his cleverness and hating his abuse of power. The single most unsettling scene involves the loss of her virginity; rather than simply ravage her on a bed in a quick moment of passion, he orchestrates a dominant/submissive routine down to the smallest detail. He tells her to strip and put on a black evening dress, and after turning around and placing his cuffs, gun, badge, and pepper spray on the table, he has her come up behind him and gently put her hands down his pants.Ansel's current wife, Sharla (Gina Gershon), is introduced in a shot that reveals her only from the waist down, which wouldn't be worth mentioning were it not for the fact that she's without underwear. When we do finally see her face and observe her actions as the story unfolds, it's like a typecast come to life – an older woman that dresses provocatively and wears too much makeup, especially around the eyes, with a vocabulary she all too often enhances with crude four-letter words. She has a part to play in the scheme to murder Ansel's ex-wife, although it isn't what anyone in the film thinks it is. Incriminating photos of her work their way into the plot; they're but one of several elements that contribute to the final scene, the shocking brutality of which is matched only by a final revelation that will throw audiences completely for a loop.Serving, I suppose, as a preview of the finale is a scene where Chris is beaten by biker thugs. He spends the rest of the film limping and with purple bruises all over his face. I don't think the violence in ""Killer Joe"" was intended to be fun or entertaining, although given the film's stage roots and Letts' affinity for characters struggling with moral and spiritual questions, I'm hard pressed to say that the violence is in any way allegorical. It is, however, very much consistent with the Southern Gothic genre, a category this film most certainly falls into. I cannot sit here and say that I liked this movie. Truth be told, I don't think I would ever want to watch it again. Having said that, I recognized what it was aiming for, and I definitely appreciated it for its technical merits and the strong performances.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)",Killer Joe
85,eshwarmail,Mainstream thriller done with a solid business mind,5,23 December 2012,"Its an understatement to say it is dark. It is a psychopathic thriller featuring emotionless characters who have never heard of the concept of being ethical. It could have worked even if it was setup during the cavemen era for its barbarism. One thing to ponder though is how they roped in Matthew McConaughey and how he made this watchable.Chris (Emile Hirsch) belongs to a dysfunctional family and is neck deep in debts with the wrong guy. He overhears that his mother has a fat insurance policy and the beneficiary is his young sister Dottie (Juno Temple). He convinces his father Ansel (Thomas Haden Church) of a plan to murder her mother by putting a hit on her. His father who has divorced and re-married Sharla (Gina Gershon) agrees to this and so does the rest of the family unanimously. Chris recommends Killer Joe (Matthew McConaughey) a reputed hit-man also a cop who has a strict advance pay policy. When the family could not meet that, Joe gives them another offer.From the word go the tone is set to be sleazy and gory and the same continues for the rest of the movie. The actors with their limited talent gives in their best shot even if the script does not demand of it. The characters, their home is presented in different ways during different circumstances. For example when they start out all are scarcely dressed, drugs everywhere, spitting in the living room etc, rest of the scenes it is spic and span with all of them well dressed throughout. McConaughey who mostly plays the well-dressed lawyer or a boyish charmer takes the darker side this time as a sleazy, sadistic bad guy but not betraying his Texan accent. The final humiliation scene works well as a shocker. The movie knows its target audience and the selling points playing close to its strengths with hardly any deviation. It could have been lot worse but stays afloat with a director who has a presence of mind and a steady hand.Mainstream thriller done with a solid business mind",Killer Joe

The Trailer trash Killer Joe is probably everything you'd expect it to be. The game cast assembled is quite the assortment of talent. Matthew McConaughey, in particular, shines through with a subtle, darkly comic, and quietly terrifying performance that blows any of his other credits out of the water. Characters have to be careful with what they say or do around him, never knowing what may send him flying off the handle.Still, not everything works. The violence of the third act goes over the top, even in context. Also, and I'm sorry, but Juno Temple did nothing for me in this movie.

89,Aly200,"Visceral, Violent & Darkly Comic",7,27 August 2017,"Oscar winning director William Friedkin has never been afraid to shy away from dark material as evidenced by the controversial, but Oscar nominated ""The Exorcist"" in 1973. However Friedkin outdoes that unsettling supernatural horror film with this deeply disturbing thriller that makes ""The Exorcist"" look tame by comparison. Based on the play by Tracy Letts (who also wrote the Award winning 'Aigust: Osage County'), the film follows a financially desperate family who hires a mysterious P.I./hit-man to kill the former familial matriarch. However the situation soon spirals into a torrent of terrifyingly uncomfortable scenes of violence and sexual depravity that leaves a shocking wave of startling consequences in its wake. The film is well cast with Emile Hirsch as the ne'er do well son who hires the titular hit-man; Hirsch plays his character, Chris, with a well meaning demeanor towards his little sister, Dottie, but Chris does not comprehend what his actions will unleash once he contacts Joe Cooper and ultimately learns the severity of what he has done. Thomas Haden Church, no stranger to playing some desperate characters (watch his work in ""SpiderMan 3"" for an example) is the dimwitted patriarch who just goes with the flow of his son's insane plan to off his ex-wife. Gina Gershon is the foul mouthed and self-serving stepmother who is in the plan for her own gain & also pays quite a sick and bloody price for her own foolish motives. Then there's the virginal-like, but emotionally (and clearly mentally impaired) Dottie, played to perfection by Juno Temple. Dottie sadly doesn't have a filter when voicing her thoughts which hurts the plans of her family, but her childish persona is what draws the normally aloof Joe Cooper to her; providing a unique relationship dynamic aside from the dysfunctional family angle.The film's standout performance however goes to Matthew McConaughey's subtlety maniacal & volatile portrayal of the title character. At first we are shown how calm and collected his demeanor normally is; tapping into the usual McConaughey skill set. However as the film progresses & his cruelty is slowly uncovered, unease begins to set in particularly when he seduces the virginal Dottie (McConaughey was a rom-com lead for a reason, but this starts to veer away from that image). The climactic turn comes during the film's explosively depraved final act where Killer Joe's true sadistic side is unleashed as McConaughey screams epithets of threats and engages in one horrific scene of sexual depravity that will jar even the most stone-faced viewer. This is definitely the film that turned McConaughey into a far more bankable dramatic lead following his rom-com roles; there's no debate in my opinion that was a spooky turning point. The content of the film is definitely not for the squeamish viewer especially if one is familiar with some of director William Friedkin's work, again mostly with ""The Exorcist"". However given the levels of S&M type acts, these are probably the boldest risks taken by the screenwriters, director and the actors (again particularly from the usually likable Matthew McConaughey) which do pay off but at the cost of unforgettable imagery. If you dare, give ""Killer Joe"" a try, but be warned that you'll be in for a wild ride.",Killer Joe
90,ghost_dog86,"What do fried chicken, saliva and the most tasteless film of the year have in common?",2,6 August 2012,"If there is one good thing to come out of a vulgar for vulgarities sake film such as ""Killer Joe"", it is that hopefully this will put an end to the Tracy Letts experiment. In yet another film from the dreadful collaboration of director William Friedkin (The Exorcist) and playwright Tracy Letts (Bug) ""Killer Joe"" is a star studded, putrid mess of a film, starring Matthew McConaughey (The Lincoln Lawyer) Emile Hirsch (Into the Wild) Juno Temple (The Dark Knight Rises)Thomas Haden Church (Sideways) and Gina Gershon (Face/Off). I for one didn't think it could get any worse than 2006's ""Bug"", but what ""Bug"" was to a boring/nonsensical/acid trip, ""Killer Joe"" is to shock-centric style filmmaking, with sequences of brutality and misogyny lifted onto a pedestal, coinciding with head-scratchingly elongated scenes of zero substance. What Friedkin and Letts have created with ""Killer Joe"" is a film that does what it wants, when it wants to, at the expense of its audience. Let me give you an example of what I mean: If Friedkin wants to show a vagina, it doesn't seem to matter what the mood of the film is or what may be gained or lost by bringing the film to a screeching halt to show said vagina; Friedkin is getting his vagina close up. Furthermore, if Letts wants to write a twenty minute interrogation scene that meanders for nineteen of those minutes, it is happening whether you like it or not. It's these woeful filmmaking decisions, among many others (I'm specifically talking about the disturbingly absurd fried chicken scene, which everyone planning to see this film has probably heard about by now) that absolutely ruined any chance for ""Killer Joe"" as a watchable film. In short: This is a film that doesn't straddle the border of clever and absurd, but pretty much trashes the clever and embraces the absurd, resulting in something that becomes far too strange for comfort.Side Note: Those who loved ""Killer Joe"" probably love the work of David Lynch as well; the reason being that ""Killer Joe"" falls into the same ""experimental"" column as your common Lynch film. ""Killer Joe"" is filled (FILLED) with scenes that make little sense or if they do will have audiences wondering what they have just watched. So, just like any Lynch film, no matter how absurd the visuals or the dialogue, many critics will proclaim ""Killer Joe"" brilliant, making claims that there is something deeper at work here than there actually is. Let me assure you, there is nothing more to this film than the deplorable trash that is on the screen.The Lett's Problem: As with Lett's last casual adaptation (the aforementioned ""Bug"") the dialogue in this FILM sounds like the dialogue of a PLAY; wherein all of the conversations are non-thematically drawn-out to the point where much of it seemed either forced and or becomes boring (and I am not saying Plays are boring). The overall pacing of this film is also hindered by the play-like script, with scenes which are prolonged to the point of exhaustion.With all that said, there is an actual storyline here. The plot follows a young man (played by Hirsch) who is deep in debt with ""some very bad people"" and decides, with the help of his father (Church), sister (Temple) and his step-mother (Gershon) to hire a hit-man, by the name of Killer Joe Cooper, to kill his mother so he can collect the insurance money. And if that was all this story would have been about, this may have been a half way decent film. Instead audiences are bombarded with mounds of disturbing visuals treated in a flippant manner, editing which is all over the place, nonsensical nudity, numbing violence, acting that is so over-the-top it is uncomfortable to watch and an entire plot that is drowned beneath a dark comedic atmosphere that basically confuses audiences to the point of repulsion (quickly bypassing annoyance).Matthew McConaughey's Performance: Before watching this film, I had heard an interview with McConaughey stating how the first time he read this script he turned it down simply on the basis that he thought it was an all around ugly piece of work. Well, needless to say (because I've already said it) his first instincts were right on the money. And this is a very interesting point, because aside from Gershon (who is the best thing in this film) McConaughey not only comes through with another stand out performance (following his work in ""Magic Mike"") but also one of the best performances of his career, no matter how off-putting it may be. It is just a shame that the best part of this career altering performance lies in the final, vomit inducing, thirty minutes. A final thirty minutes that not only voids anything good about this film (the little that there is) but more importantly may unfortunately be the reason McConaughey will be overlooked come awards season.Final Thought: All you really need to know about ""Killer Joe"" is that this is yet another Friedkin/Letts collaboration that's sole purpose is to elicit a visceral response, not to tell a coherent story. True, some audiences may laugh, some may be repulsed (as I was), some may say they enjoyed themselves and secretly were repulsed, and some may have acted liked they wanted to puke and secretly enjoyed themselves, but at the end of it all, the storyline is so muddied by Letts and Friedkin's own form of visually explicit big screen self gratification, that nobody in the audience will care about any kind of halfwit plot that Letts is attempting to construct. So, all things considered, and throwing in the most vile scene I have seen in any film since ""The Human Centipede 2"", I cannot in good consciousness recommend ""Killer Joe"" to anyone; especially if you are planning on going to KFC anytime soon.Follow me on Twitter @moviesmarkus",Killer Joe
91,rgblakey,Killer Joe is a deep fried twisted tale,8,25 December 2012,"Matthew McConaughey has been on a role this year with roles in Magic Mike and Bernie, but nothing like his latest in Killer Joe. The buzz on the street is that this film was amazing and his performance was top notch. Not since Frailty have we gotten a chance to see McConaughey tackle such an insane role. Could this live up to the hype and continue his amazing year or will it be the one to bring it to a halt? Killer Joe follows a drug dealer in debt who decides to murder his mom for the insurance money. With the help of his father and step mother, they hire a police detective who just happens to also be a contract killer. With no money to pay up front, they offer up his younger sister as retainer to cover the job, but when things don't go as planned things take a wild turn. This is a strange movie from beginning to end, but thanks to some great performances and over the top insanity turned out to be a unique great experience. McConaughey delivers easily his best and creepiest performance to date. His character is disturbing, scary, and a bit endearing all at once. The rest of the cast give great performances as well to bring this trailer trash world to life. This film is filled with unlikeable characters which is why it works. There is never really anyone here that is all that good as everyone here are low lives. This is one of the strangest movies in some time, with a very Tarantino type feel letting the bulk of the movie be carried by the dialogue. As the film progresses it captures your interest for more wondering what really going on, thus is making it the kind of film that will keep you thinking till the very end.As this film ends, it takes some strange twists and turns both comical and disturbing to create an almost brilliant piece of cinema. A truly well-made film will dig into your brain and be hard pressed to find its way out. This is one of those films, you may love it or hate, but you will not be able to forget it.",Killer Joe

97,daggersineyes,Wish I could give it a zero score,1,31 August 2013,"This movie made me feel so embarrassed for the people involved. There was nothing good or interesting about this film. Bad acting, under- developed characters, awful direction, terrible scripting and no real point or plot development. All tied up with a ridiculous finale. It's main claim to fame is a couple of so-called ""shocking scenes"" such as the overly drawn out & laughable chicken leg scene. The punch in the face seconds before that scene is actually far more shocking - but even then, it's just a punch in the face. Nothing we haven't seen before a million times. Another dubious claim to fame it has is a pedophile rape scene. Well done dudes. You glorified child-rape. Go team #childabuseFelt to me like this movie was a failed attempt to be as ""shocking"" as some of the truly horrific Asian thriller/crime flicks I've seen. But sadly there really isn't anything worth seeing here.Do yourself a HUGE favour and skip this pile of fetid waste. You wanna see real ""violent humiliation"" (if that's your thing) watch Martyrs, The Seasoning House, A Serbian Film or even I Spit On Your Grave(original & remake) and you'll appreciate just how lame the chicken thing really is. Or if you're looking for ""shocking violence"" see I Saw the Devil, Five Fingers, Old Boy or The Chaser. Or for ""bizarre"" and/or darkly humorous (and involving a serial killer) try Freeway. At least these movies have other things going for them.This movie gets 1 point only because there's no zero or negative options.",Killer Joe
98,deadbull-95171,masterful comedy crime horror and just a great movie,10,2 September 2021,"Friedkin's most compelling thing since The Exorcist. Combining genres has been around awhile now. Things like the first RoboCop really put them on my map, but then I'm not 100 years old yet. But this is one of the most seamless integrations yet.It's quite serious and from all the true crime I have read, utterly plausible and realistic. This is the real American Gospel, between the lines, under the veneer of civilization, when people just do what they feel like doing.This certainly can't be called a coy production. The only moment that leaves a vague doubt occurs in the final 5 seconds when you can't be 100% sure of how far that trigger is going to pull, but that becomes a minor point in the matter, as either way, it's a satisfactory way to end the movie.In the Wrestler, does Mickey Rourke's final jump kill him?Same deal here, but with a stronger suggestion of lethality because Killer Joe has overlooked the nature of Dottie's loyalties, and his final reassuring smile of joy is just so much beggary for his life. Who does Dottie really love the most? The guy that took her virginity or the one who wanted to save it?Best performance ever by Gina Gershon, T Haden Church is exemplary TH Church, and Mathew in a big Star Turn. No one is weak here.

99,lnvicta,"Equal parts hilarious, vile, and demented, elevated by top-notch performances across the board led by a magnetic McConaughey.",8,11 March 2016,"Killer Joe is a roller-coaster of a movie. At first it seems like a dark comedy, then a crime drama plot starts to uncover, and by the end it becomes downright terrifying. I'm a sucker for these kinds of movies and Killer Joe absolutely nails everything it goes for. This kind of story couldn't be pulled off without the right director. Thankfully William Friedkin knocks it out of the park. You can smell the white trash emanating from the screen. Every detail of every action is given the right amount of attention; every shot has purpose. Not one second is gone to waste. And in order for a story like this to truly resonate you'd need competent actors, and I don't think you could find a more perfect cast for Killer Joe if you tried. McConaughey is absolutely mesmerizing as this badass detective who's a hit-man on the side. The story revolves around a trailer trash family and their plan to exploit an insurance policy on the husband's ex-wife because the son got wrapped up in a bad drug deal, so they hire Killer Joe to do the job. Little do they know, Killer Joe does not f*ck around. It's a graphic movie but it's not gratuitous. There's a reason for everything that is shown. And the narrative slowly builds to an explosive climax that leaves you flabbergasted. Seriously, the final scene in this movie which is about 10 minutes long, is absolutely phenomenal. Shocking, riveting, unsettling. Matthew McConaughey is downright villainous in this role. It's hard to call him a ""villain"" because he's straightforward in his motivations, much like it's hard to call the family the ""heroes"" because they're a bunch of moronic assholes, except the daughter who just doesn't know any better. The line between good and evil is blurred to the point of nonexistence, with Joe epitomizing this duality being the half detective half gun-for-hire hard-ass that he is. It's quite poetic, really. The characters in this movie are scum, and they all get what's coming to them.Killer Joe is a lot of things, but one thing it's not is scatterbrained. It's entirely focused and cohesive. All the genres it glosses over fit right into this depraved story arc, and it grips you to the screen from beginning to end. This movie certainly isn't for everyone, but if you can stomach Killer Joe, you won't soon forget it.",Killer Joe

Not one character seemed to have any decency and the plot was plain wicked. I am sure someone would complain that it makes fun of poor whites in Texas, which is par for Hollywood. But no matter where it was set & the class/race of the characters, it is a movie that shouldn't be made. It is a totally depressing movie that would bring you down unless you are a morbid type. I was plain let down by it and was so happy when it ended. Of course, I am guilty of moralizing but I want to warn people that it is a plain wicked movie without one iota of redeeming social value.",Killer Joe
101,Jonathon_Natsis,"Far from 'alright, alright, alright.'",4,25 December 2012,"In the climactic scene of crime-thriller Killer Joe, Matthew McConaughey's eponymous hit-man sits a couple of his clients down to hash out the small matter of an unpaid debt. What begins as an absorbingly tense scene threatening to explode at a moment's notice quickly degrades into a farce employing weak dialogue, a groan-inducing twist and even a simulated sexual act with a famous piece of fast food. Fittingly, this more lamentable than lingering conclusion sums up the faults of the entire film. Director William Friedkin's intentions are evident, but he constantly overshoots the mark in a hackneyed attempt to hold a mirror up to society by showing us the world's most dysfunctional family. When the morally absent Chris (Emile Hirsch) devises a plan to finally get out of drug-related debt, his father Ansel (Thomas Hayden Church) is on board. The plan? Hire a hit-man to murder his mother and collect the life insurance payout. Unfortunately, hit-man Joe operates on a very strict contract; the terms of which include up-front payment. As a result, he practically takes ownership of Chris' young, unassuming sister Dottie (Juno Temple) as a 'retainer', complicating the situation just a little.McConaughey is the only cast member that manages to infuse some believability into his role. He appears to take some perverse pleasure in pushing the limits of what is supposed to be an inherently threatening character, but can't mask the film's flaws alone. As an erotic thriller, Killer Joe manages to hit all the wrong notes. Gratuitous nudity sparks memories of local phenomenon Underbelly- and not the acclaimed first season, either- and forms an uneasy pairing with the 'written-purely-for-shock-value' relationships between key players. Special features include a quarter-hour of uninspiring B-roll footage and a fleeting, semi- relevant director interview, in which Friedkin gladhands his cast and writer Tracy Letts.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

He wants a retainer for his services, but when the numb-skull clan can't cough up he decides he'll take nubile but emotionally disturbed daughter Dottie (aptly named) on account.It's a jet black treatise on a dysfunctional bunch of idiots who get on the wrong side of a complete and utter psychopathic madman. The performances are electrifying all round, but McConaughey is the standout player as Colonel Sanders' worst nightmare. If you've seen the film you'll know what I mean. The simulated sex act with a piece of Kentucky Fried Chicken is a real jaw dropping eye-popper and is unlikely to appear in a KFC promotional ad campaign any time soon.William Friedkin directs with a sure eye for the mad guy and cursory glances over each shoulder at the Cohen's BLOOD SIMPLE and FARGO.

106,Camoo,Absolutely NUTS,10,16 September 2011,"I just returned from a week at the Toronto Film festival, and was lucky to see many great films, many gorgeous artistic testaments, slow paced dramas, thought provoking documentaries, and even a comedy. On my last day, however, I saw Killer Joe. Um. It is very very very very difficult to write about this film. What I can say first of all and with confidence is that it absolutely blew away anything else I saw at that festival, and pretty much anything I have seen by Friedkin or anybody from his generation for a long time (Bug was a good primer for this.. Though a little under the radar, I found it really impressive.. So for those of you who have seen it, it's worth mentioning that he is collaborating with the same writer here, Tracy Letts). A few days before I had seen the new Coppola film called 'Twixt', and while I was impressed visually with his film, I couldn't shake the feeling that he had somehow lost 'it', that elusive ability to make a gripping and tight narrative picture that so captivates your attention that you forget you are watching a film and just sit back and take it. Killer Joe resets the bar for me - I had almost forgotten about the sheer power of film - to not only captivate you and enthrall you into its trance, but also its ability to shock you into a catatonic submission. You see actors that are familiar - Emile Hirsch, Gina Gershon, Matthew McConoughey, Thomas Haden Church... But no, there is nobody to recognize here. They are all so hidden underneath their personas, and so real and bloodied by their characters that not a moment passes that you question who they are. They simply are these characters, and after watching it you cannot imagine anybody else cast in any of these roles. And I will add that I never in a million years thought that I would consider Matthew McConoughey perfect for ANY role - though weirdly, he might have found the role of his life in Joe. The man is absolutely genius in this film. Dark, sadistic, calm, precise.. Perfect.I am reticent to write more details - I only urge you to see it. That said - it is not for everybody, as evidenced by the massive walk-out in the theater during the last twenty or so minutes of the screening. You will need the stomach for a film of this nature. I hate to compare, but you might consider it an x-rated Coen brothers film hopped up on steroids. Overall, it's mercifully hilarious , brilliantly written with a sly wit about it- which blunts out a lot of the violence, to where the final haunting scenes provoked twisted and maniacal laughs from audience members rather than shocked silence (which would have been the only other reasonable response to a story such as this.)So. There you have it, my rather cryptic review of a film that took me out of my seat and blew me the hell away. Peace out Friedkin, I'm a major fan again.",Killer Joe

108,dharmendrasingh,Kentucky (Fried)kin,8,18 October 2012,"'Killer Joe' is an excessively dark and disturbing imagining of Pulitzer-prize winning Tracy Letts' 1993 play and screenplay. This great film marks a (long overdue) return to form for William Friedkin.Trailer-park inhabitant Chris Smith (a visceral Emile Hirsch) desperately needs cash to pay his gambling debts, or else the sharks will settle for his blood. Chris hatches a plan with his degenerate dad Ansel (Thomas Hayden Church) and younger sister Dottie (an unforgettable Juno Temple) to kill his mom, whom they have hated ever since she left them, to claim the $50K insurance money.As they lack the courage to pull off the stunt themselves, they commission 'Killer Joe' Cooper to carry out this sordid scheme. Detracting from his typically saccharine roles, Matthew McConaughey gives a career-defining performance as the eponymous Dallas police detective who kills people for money. Assisted by Friedkin's fetishistic filming, Joe oozes magnetism. He dresses all in black and is a remnant of cowboy-era America. He'd be a perfect villain in a Sergio Leone film – provided it was rated 18. Debonair and chivalrous on the surface, Joe is actually a sadistic creep who can dish out the most precipitous violence (you won't believe the stomach-churning scene featuring a piece of fried chicken!). Things turn ugly when Joe learns of a set up. He appropriates Dottie as his 'retainer', and moves in with the family to ensure he gets his $25K fee. As dim-witted as the Smiths' are, they're smart enough to know they're dead if they don't cough up some dough. These scenes resemble ones from Friedkin's 1968 film, 'The Birthday Party'. They're meant to contain dark humour, which they do, but aren't all that funny. They serve instead to make the film more creepy.What we get is just what the ad posters proclaim: A totally twisted, deep-fried Texas redneck trailer park murder story. And I loved every minute of it.",Killer Joe

Why goddammit? I want an explanation. Her performance in Killer Joe was hands down, without a doubt, one of the best I've seen in years. Ling live Gina!!!!OK, what a fun romp this movie is, I actually went into this film thinking it was a crime drama, which yes it is that, but what is so surprising and wonderful about it is the fact that at the same time, it's bloody hilarious, it seemed to me like a modern day grindhouse feature just with a bigger budget. At first it's pretty serious, but before too long you realize just how much this movie isn't meant to be taken too seriously. The story is pretty insane, it moves at a cracking pace that when it was over I just wanted more. Yes it's violent and sexual and over the top but that's what makes it so great.The cast is just perfect, each of them have got White-trash down very well, obviously like I said before, Gina Gershon is amazing, but so is everyone else, Matthew McConaughey is rather terrifying, he stays so calm and has such great manners and grammar, you just know he's a psychopath, Juno Temple has turned in another exceptional performance, and a rather brave one too, there aren't many young actresses around like her today, so it's good to see her profile rising, and Thomas Haden Church is dead on a laugh riot as the fool, the entire cast are just too good for words.Killer Joe is frakking insane.

But, Killer Joe can be best looked upon as Friedkin's treatise on human psychology as well as social and moral decadence. Killer Joe stars the dashing, shape-shifting Matthew McConaughey in the role of a lifetime. It's absolutely incomprehensible how McConaughey continues to show such remarkable acting range and yet go unnoticed as far as the Academy is concerned. The movie is replete with gore and violence and definitely not meant for the faint-hearted. It's a movie that requires a lot of courage to be watched and savored.

111,DeuceWild_77,"Darkly funny southern gothic tale, featuring a good cast. A mix between the Coens' black comedies and Friedkin's twisted gusto.",7,12 April 2020,"Second Friedkin's adaptation from a Tracy Letts' play after ""Bug"" ('06), ""Killer Joe"" is a tale of southern gothic dark humour mainly shot at one location, the Smiths' trailer, working as a mix of a Coen Brothers' neo noir black comedy, with the daring visual style and subversive / twisted staging, way characteristic from this controversial director.Caleb Deschanel's photography and lighting sets the dark mood in which our depictable low-life characters abide, there aren't as many as peculiar camera angles or tricky shots as this director used to do, Friedkin opted to direct the film closer to its original stage play, thus giving more relevance to guide his cast throughout their performances, pushing them to their limits and having a riot doing it.Matthew McConaughey, who resembles a lot a young William L. Petersen who Friedkin gave his first shot in Hollywood, playing the leading role in ""To Live and Die in L.A."" ('85) and later in the TV film remake, ""12 Angry Men"" ('97), possesses the same stylished look, the 'macho' attitude, the manneirisms and the electrifying on-screen presence as Joe Cooper a.ka. 'Killer Joe', a corrupt Texas police detective which is also a professional hitman for hire. Some have always said that McConaughey's style of acting, looks and mannerisms are close to Woody Harrelson, but, in my view, it's way more an upgrade of William L. Petersen.McConaughey himself isn't new to this kind of psychotic and manipulative characters, he already played similar roles in ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation"" ('94) and ""Frailty"" ('01), directed by his friend, the late beloved character actor, Bill Paxton, but he improved here to a warm result, earning him an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Male Lead, among others.The well-casted supporting actors from the deliciously trashy Gina Gershon (""Red Heat"", ""Showgirls"", ""Bound"") to Thomas Haden Church (""Sideways"", ""Spider-man 3""), who is brilliant at playing a dumb redneck, Emile Hirsch (""Into the Wild"", ""Lords of Dogtown"", ""Milk"") and especially, Juno Temple as a naive girl with strong emotional problems, shine above the material in their tragically funny dialogue-driven performances.Surely, this kind of trailer-trash characters are played too over-the-top in certain scenes and there are situations of extremely bad taste that are not for everyone, but Friedkin establishes a line between being mere caricatures to really fit on a more serious tone, when it's required, in which the movie counterbalances relatively well.In short, ""Killer Joe"" is an engaging little indie film, darkly funny in parts and quite bold in others, delivered by the 'mad genius' director of ""The French Connection"" ('71); ""The Exorcist"" ('73); ""Sorcerer"" ('77) and ""Cruising"" ('80). It's better than some others Friedkin's movies such as ""The Guardian"" ('90) or the previous Letts' ""Bug"", but nothing to write home about.It feels like Friedkin's 'Swan's Song' to the movie biz after 5 decades in Hollywood, going through a lot of undeserved box office and critical misfires, which resulted of him being at a certain point, blackballed to be financed and / or creative control over his films (see also, John Millius, Michael Cimino, Walter Hill, John Carpenter and Paul Schrader).My vote is a 6.5, but i upgrade here to 7 !!",Killer Joe
112,DanLives1980,Did that just happen???,10,27 July 2013,"Welcome back, William Friedkin of The Exorcist, French Connection and To Live and Die in LA... where the hell have you been? It's no secret I suppose that Friedkin, as great as he always was, is one of the laziest directors of all time. Not that he makes bad films. Clearly I'm not saying that at all. I really appreciated his older brutal, gritty crime dramas and such. But he never made anywhere near as many films as he should have and that man could have belted out as many classics as Kubrick, had he cared! Killer Joe marks his return to the director's chair and it's one of the few returns I've anticipated the most in recent times along with the return of Walter Hill.Killer Joe was a hell of a gamble for Friedkin for a number of reasons, besides the fact that it was a film he knew the mainstream would absolutely not be interested in.For a start, the movie is white trash Texas AND based on a theatre play. That spells art-house, something Friedkin fans might never associate him with. But even stranger, it spells very offensive art-house that isn't looking to make friends with Texas.Secondly, the majority of the cast are either taken with a pinch of salt or settled into character roles that their fans would't feel comfortable seeing them in. Let's get that particular ball rolling, shall we? Emile Hirsch (who I don't like), plays Chris Smith, an annoying, horrid trailer trash drug abusing dead end kid who wants to have his own mother murdered so he can inherit her will. He's in trouble and owes money. Not having the money could mean paralysis or death in the near future.Getting his dad and stepmother involved in a plot to have a hit-man murder his mother (also the mother of Dottie, Chris's brain-damaged younger sister who has been wrong ever since their mother tried to smother her, and played to alarming accuracy by Juno Temple).In comes cold and somewhat calmly deranged 'Killer' Joe Cooper, a cop that murders people on the side as a second job. He will take the job and wait for Mrs Smith's will to be cashed so long as he can have Dottie as a retainer, meaning that he will do with her whatever he damn well pleases.As events unfold, everything goes to plan, but Chris becomes increasingly irrational and untrustworthy, as does his stepmother (the awesome Gina Gershon). Sensing everything falling down around him, Killer Joe remains in cop mode and finds himself at the centre of a bigger conspiracy.It's not so much the plot that's different here, it's McConnaughey as Killer Joe. I've not found him in many enjoyable roles since Dazed and Confused or Reign of Fire, but here, he delivers one of the most extremely charismatic yet psychopathic roles I have ever witnessed and this film is disturbing to its very core.The odd thing is that as disturbing as it is, you're either going to switch off out of disgust for what happens or the things your eyes will catch - as Friedkin is not one to hold back or be told he's out of order - and if you keep watching, you may very well laugh and find yourself extremely satisfied with the outcome.Killer Joe is about despicable people and not one of the characters are likable, but saying that, you do often pity Chris's honest but simple and burdened father Ansel (Thomas Hayden Church in possibly his best to date) and Dottie, who can't help but be Dottie, whatever the situation.This could very well have been a Gary Oldman film, were it British, which is also why I appreciate it so much. It has no shortage of guts and is so willing to offend the narrow minded that it pleases me to no end.I dare to suggest boyfriend and girlfriend watch this on a cosy night in. If not, it's one for the boys to watch with a beer!",Killer Joe

The movie ends after she is shooting without any reason in order to save his brother but killing the only one person really interested in her: his brother. This movie is absurd; it tries to get value only from perversions. Imho this movie likes pedophile, psychopaths, rapists, perverts, porn amateurs, whore-mongers, wore-wives, and so on.

114,TheEtherWalk,A pitch-perfect black comedy and an ingenious social commentary. Everybody pays...,10,17 June 2013,"Killer Joe by William Friedkin, adapted almost slavishly from the play of the same name by Tracy Letts, tells the story of the Smith family, who pay a hit-man to kill their matriarch for her life insurance policy. Matthew McConaughey is outstanding as the title character but the real star of this film... well I'll get to that shortly because it's not immediately apparent. This seems like just another genre film on the surface. Sun-bleached buildings. Eyes hidden behind sunglasses and a cowboy hat. The confined space within a trailer. A murder plot gone awry, double-crossings, twists, all served up with fried chicken and potato salad. Stylistically this film is very good and it's got a great dark sense of humor throughout. But to see the real genius of this film you have to look a bit closer at the characters and the actions they make throughout the film. I see more layers every time I watch it, and here are just a few of them.Killer Joe is a statement about American culture, about the slow decay and splitting of the family unit, the normalization of sex, violence and apathy and the bastardization of traditions and values into something quite sinister. A can of pumpkin pie filling and a chicken leg are used as weapons at one point. Need I say more? This film literally takes the illusions of American life and smashes you in the face with them. Very modern art.*****SPOILERS***** The characters live in a world which is a bit exaggerated for effect but not unlike our own. They live in a society that forces every man to fend for himself. A dog eat dog world. Joe's rules cement this idea in their heads because if they don't do as he says and follow his rules, he'll kill them. Or as he so impersonally tells them, ""You will be killed."" This is an important detail because it informs on the father and son psychologically that these rules are bigger than him and are therefore absolute. But not only do Ansel and Sharleen never try to stand up to Joe, they treat him better than they do Chris, Ansel's actual son. Why? Because he got involved with drugs and ended up owing money to drug dealers. So he gets what he deserves. That's the subliminal message that Joe's presence conveys. He is the law, and the law punishes all for their transgressions. Everyone in this film gets exactly what they deserve in the end, with no room for forgiveness or compassion. Chris's attempt to rescue Dottie is the closest they ever come to breaking the rules and acting out of love instead of logic. But it's also hinted at that his love for Dottie is impure and driven by incest.My favorite character in this film by far is Ansel, portrayed perfectly and hilariously by Thomas Haden Church. He's like a shaved ape, a de-evolution of 20th century man. He's always apathetic, watching TV and drinking beer. He lives in his own little world and lets things deteriorate around him. (The play features a fallen tree crushing part of that trailer's roof that he does nothing about). When his wife Sharleen is being degraded horribly he never stands up for her because she cheated on him, she broke the rules of their relationship so she deserves what happens to her in his eyes. Even when Joe gives them a moment by themselves, he simply stands behind her and asks her, with tears in his eyes ""Are you okay? Okay."" He's always impotent despite his large stature, and in my mind Ansel is the real main character of this film because at any point he could have stopped Joe and accepted the consequences, but he didn't, and in the end becomes so tamed and docile that he begs Joe to kill his son. An analogy of sending young men to die in wars? That moment is so crazy that it really shows that the whole theme of the movie really revolves around him. Like a trained dog, he's brainwashed into believing he has no choice in the awful decisions he makes throughout the film. Joe represents the culture of fear that pushes rational people to make irrational choices, and Ansel is a perfect pawn for his system of intimidation and control. For more on Ansel search up a good essay by Ronald William Smith who portrayed him on stage.There's two interesting monologues in this film that give additional thematic clues. Chris's story about the rabbits that went rabid and Joe's story about the river slowly being lost to Oklahoma. Both reflect Joe's changing presence throughout the film from a stranger to being welcomed into the trailer like a family member. ""He's in his room"" says Ansel at one point. He also just walks around naked without anyone saying a word about it. He's like a charming cancer cell, he infects and then he spreads deeper and deeper, creating chaos like the rabies did to the rabbits until they tore each other apart. Joe's character is a symbol of corruption, sex and violence, under a guise of order. Letts is trying to say that American households literally invite this sex and violence in and make it a normal part of their lives. Whether or not you agree with his point of view, this is a scathing, white-hot indictment of modern day American family life that pulls absolutely no punches, and tears back the curtain of Western culture in a way not seen since David Lynch's Blue Velvet.In the end, Dottie has the gun on Joe. Does she pull the trigger? Is their love really pure? What fate does Joe deserve? Is he truly a monster or is he just a mirror, reflecting the chaos of the family back at them? Maybe the cancer of their lives was always there, and Joe is simply the catalyst that sets it loose. I also wonder if she planned all along for Chris and Ansel to screw up their plot and remove themselves from her life. Maybe that's why she encouraged them. This is definitely one of my favorite films of 2012.",Killer Joe
115,HorrorOverEverything,"I Can't Tell You That You Will Like ""Killer Joe"", But I Loved It",10,17 October 2012,"Me telling you that you would like ""Killer Joe"" if you sat down and watched it would be similar to me telling you that you would like Football if you sat down and watched it. While liking ""Killer Joe"" does require a bit more intelligence than liking football does, it is similar nonetheless. If you do not understand football as much as someone who loves football does, you will not enjoy it as much as that person. The same can be said about ""Killer Joe"".For me this was one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. I am not the kind of person who throws that around a lot, in fact I don't think I have said that about any movie in the past 10 years. ""Killer Joe"" sucked me in like no other movie has in a while. The characters were so real that I truly found myself scared for them when they were put in harms way, I really felt like real people were in trouble. The performances in this movie just blew me away.The story was incredibly gripping. I was sitting on the edge of me seat the whole way through feeling so anxious as to what would happen next. There was one point in the movie where I honestly felt as if I wanted to look away because thats how intense it got, I didn't want to look away because I was Squeamish (I have sat through the worst of the worst, I have seen it all) but it was due to the sheer fact that I have never felt these emotion from a movie before. ""Killer Joe"" is one of a kind, and like most things that are one of a kind it is not for everybody. There will be plenty of people who shrug this movie off as mediocre. But then there will be the people that truly get this movie, and those people will be so happy that they gave this masterpiece their time. I suggest that everybody give this a chance, you may hate it but it is still worth sitting down and watching. I can at least promise you that you haven't seen anything like it. 10/10",Killer Joe
116,Hawkensian,"Some may be offended by it, but I think Killer Joe is the best film of 2012.",9,15 February 2013,"Killer Joe's premise is simple but invigoratingly delivered. Chris Smith (Emile Hirsh) has got himself in trouble with the underworld, if he doesn't produce some cash, he's a dead man. He reasons with his father Ansel (Thomas Haden Church) that everyone would be happier if his mother Adele was killed, as she has a $50,000 life insurance policy. Considering Adele is his wretched ex-wife, he agrees, as does his girlfriend Sharla (Gina Gershon) and teenage daughter Dottie (Juno Temple). Although Chris doesn't have the money up front, Killer Joe, a Dallas police officer who moonlights as a contract killer, accepts the job on the condition that Dottie serves as sexual collateral.'Killer Joe' is a fantastic thriller with a warped tension that you don't encounter that often. This film confirms that Matthew McConaughey is on a rapid upward trajectory, he gives an intense performance that's utterly steeped in menace. Though 'Killer' Joe Cooper remains largely restrained and ambiguous throughout the film, each syllable of his southern drawl is loaded with a palpable danger. His performance is captivating; it creates a pervasive, looming sense of dread and depravity that suggests something very bad is going to happen at any moment.The praise doesn't stop with McConaughey, the whole cast delivers to the best of their ability, it really is an actors' film. If I hadn't researched her, I would have assumed on the credibility of her southern accent that the British Juno Temple was a Texas native. She shows good dramatic range as Dottie, the slightly strange, child-like girl at the centre of the film.William Friedkin has outdone himself with his second collaboration with writer Tracy Letts; he directs the taut, punchy material perfectly. What's most refreshing is that 77-year-old Friedkin was bold enough to release it uncut with the dreaded NC-17 certificate; he wasn't going to allow himself to sell out.Seeing as the film's source material is a stage play, it isn't a film of many sets; it seldom leaves the confines of the Smith family's trashy trailer. Much like their first collaboration 'Bug', 'Killer Joe' delivers biting tension and a maelstrom of chaos in a cramped, domestic setting.I can honestly compliment every area of this film. Tyler Bates' score is brilliantly suspenseful, especially when it introduces Killer Joe, it further adds to his aura of danger. The film is also beautifully shot; it's stunning in high definition.Despite the menace and darkness of it all, the film is laced with deadpan humour, especially in the film's final quarter, the demented absurdity of which leaves you wondering what the hell just happened!www.hawkensian.com",Killer Joe

118,bennyhagen,Good but not quite 100%,7,18 December 2012,"Not sure what exactly to make of this. The cast is extremely well assembled and the actors are really playing the hell out of their roles. If that's not enough Matthew McConaughey's sexual deviant is more refined than ever while also having a lot to work with, so he is simply dominating this movie. I did feel some lack of completeness though. Might have been something lost during the translation to the screen, maybe due to parts that needed to be excluded from the final script, I haven't read the book, so I don't really know. But the characters - though well written - are missing depth, which is not necessarily a problem given the caricaturistic nature of the material, but without characters that we really know or truly care about the conclusion for one didn't work for me, making the movie end on a somewhat disappointing or at least unsatisfying note. Nevertheless, this is a great film, a lot of fun, great performances, very entertaining and if you are into this Cohen-ish, dark-comedy-satire-thriller kind of stuff, you should definitely not miss this one.7/10",Killer Joe
119,J_Trex,Wickedly Good Film Noir,10,4 September 2012,"I really like this movie. As excellent film noir thrillers go, with a good streak of black comedy, this movie rivalled ""Double Indemnity"". I suspect the reason for the delay may have been the producers tying themselves into knots to avoid the dreaded NC-17 rating. Could they have cut out some of the more violent scenes that were sex related? Probably so. Would the movie have been as good? Probably not. Anyway, the cast was perfect. Matthew McConaughey was great as the title character ""Killer Joe"", a rogue Texas lawman who works on the side as a contract killer. Emile Hirsh plays the hapless Chris, who owed some local drug dealers a lot of cash. His plan was to hire ""Killer Joe"" to commit murder to help him get out. He had plenty of help from family members, some of whom were working different angles. Thomas Haden Church was really excellent as Chris's father. Gina Gershon was wickedly great as his step-mom. It was all very clever and never was slow.If you like some of David Lynch's better work (""Wild at Heart"", or ""Blue Velvet"", you'll like this move.",Killer Joe

That said, what a story!! When I write a review it is never my intent to talk about the plot or story line and I won't start now. What I will say is that this is truly an original script that will shock you, make you squirm in your seat, and thoroughly entertain you. I've never been a Matthew McConaughey fan however he is superb in the role of the sleazy killer Joe. I also thought both Gina Gershon and Thomas Hayden Church were equally exceptional, however the breakout actor was Emile Hirsch who plays Chris the down and out loser brother/son in this trailer trash redneck drama. His portrayal of the desperate and dumb loser is nothing short of spellbinding and if for no other reason makes this movie meaningful. I could see this film become a cult hit like ""Pulp fiction"", it has all the elements of great movie making that will stick to you like good KFC chicken.",Killer Joe
122,DubhDoo,"Dark, twisted and blackly comic",8,22 June 2013,"Some directors mellow with age. They start out making controversial films, but as time goes on, they slide into 'nicer' territory that would be regarded as more suitable for someone of their age. Not William Friedkin, whose latest film, 'Killer Joe', finds the maverick director on lurid form, causing controversy that would undoubtedly please him. This is highlighted by the fact that the film garnered the 'dreaded' NC- 17 certificate in the U.S.; although, even at the age of 77, it is unlikely that this troubled Friedkin, if anything, he embraced it. This film was marketed as ""a totally twisted deep-fried Texas redneck trailer park murder story."" It's a description that may sound like the work of a marketing team exaggerating the film, but in fact, it perfectly encapsulates the film. Incidentally, if that description doesn't appeal to you, then neither will 'Killer Joe', because it is twisted, and then some. It is Friedkin's second adaptation of a Tracy Letts play ('Bug' was his first) being based on Letts' debut play of the same name (the playwright also acts the film's screenwriter).The plot concerns the Smith family, spearheaded by the father/son duo of Chris and Ansel (Emile Hirsch and Thomas Haden Church forming an unbelievably gormless unit). Chris owes money to some loan sharks who threaten to murder him if they are not paid, so he decides to kill his mother and take the insurance money. Chris hires an oily detective named Joe Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) who moonlights as a killer to carry out the murder. However, things become complicated when Joe takes Chris' simple-minded sister, Dottie (a superb Juno Temple) as a retainer for his 'services'.With his familiarity with the country that is home to this trailer trash culture, Letts manages to get past the characters simply being caricatures. The family at the centre of 'Killer Joe' are trash and worse than that; after spending about 100 minutes in their company, you feel dirty. Matthew McConaughey remarked that after reading the script, he felt that he ""was disgusted and wanted to take a shower with a steel brush"". Additionally, the film also tiptoes around being misogynistic, something that is most notable in the now-infamous 'chicken leg' scene, which may cause you to never look at KFC the same way again.Yet, 'Killer Joe' is no depressing tale about a dysfunctional white trash family, instead it is an occasionally funny black comedy. A black comedy so dark that Friedkin himself has referred to it as ""a black hole comedy"". Despite feeling stagey at times – it was shot in less than three weeks, in a handful of locations and its action mainly takes place in monologues – this works excellently as a piece of cinema. It may repulse you and its ending may leave you speechless, but Friedkin's latest is a solid and oddly likable film elevated by a brilliant and electrifying McConaughey, who has never been better.",Killer Joe
123,~AleXa~,Actually painful to watch....,2,27 December 2012,"It has been quite some time since a movie has disappointed and disgusted me so much that I was compelled to write a review, but here it is.Killer Joe is intended to be a basement noir satire, but it fails on almost every count. There's nothing particularly interesting to grab and hold the audience's attention, and right when it picks up around the middle of the movie, it quickly fizzles out. The graphic nudity is just unnecessary and tasteless. The entire plot is bland and subdued, never really evolving past the trailer park.Inconsistencies abound with Chris nearly getting his face beaten off and he's going around talking with a purple bruise on his face like he fell out of the bed that morning. The beat- down scene by the biker guys was horribly done; the director and editor clearly don't pay attention to detail.The characters' monotony keep the viewer substantially detached from the characters, which one could argue is with good reason, but someone has to be likable and relatable. The entire time, I was trying to figure out the mystery behind the story, the who did what and why, and then you find out it doesn't exist. By the end of the movie, all I wanted was that 102 minutes and my $4.99 back. What a waste of time... The ONLY positive thing I can say is that the acting was done very well.FINAL THOUGHTS: I don't think I've ever had a movie offend my sensibilities more, and I'm pretty open-minded and liberal. The ONLY saving grace is McConaughey's stellar performance. If you think this is a mystery suspense about a killer, don't waste your time. If you have 102 minutes to kill and care nothing for character development, plot, or consistency and have a crude sense of humor, then this is right up your alley. Otherwise, do yourself a favor and rent The Bone Collector or Kiss the Girls.2.0 of 10.0 stars",Killer Joe
124,tgooderson,"Compelling, Gruesome and excellent",9,30 June 2012,"A young man, Chris (Emile Hirsch) in debt to a drug dealer and his father Ansel (Thomas Haden Church) decide to hire a contract killer known as Killer Joe (Matthew McConaughey) to kill Chris' mother in order to claim $50,000 life insurance money. Unable to pay upfront, Joe suggests taking Chris' innocent young sister Dottie (Juno Temple) as a retainer, something that doesn't sit easily with Chris.This is a darkly comic and extremely violent film which is likely to repulse some and delight others. There were several walk outs in the packed screening I was in and many audible gasps as well as perhaps the biggest laugh I've ever heard in a cinema. For an example of how it will polarize people I turned to my girlfriend on the way out and said ""what did you think?"" She replied ""I hated it. It was awful. One star"". I on the other hand thought it was excellent.The film's opening act reminded me a little of Paris, Texas. The slide guitar made an occasional audible appearance and the run down look of the Texan landscape as well as the pacing was very reminiscent of Wim Wenders' classic. After about half an hour these similarities ceased as the pace picked up and the tension, comedy and violence increased. The story is pretty simple but intriguing. A man is in debt, wants his mother killed and hires a shady, dangerous killer to do the job. Added to this are the superb characters. Killer Joe is an old fashioned gentleman who appears to have great respect for women, has manners and is reserved, thoughtful but dangerous. He is played wonderfully by Matthew McConaughey who might be on the verge of losing the 'Mahogany' McConaughey moniker I give him. You always get the feeling that underneath his thoughtful, brooding exterior is a vicious killer and this side of him comes out in a couple of scenes, one of which is incredibly brutal.Although McConaughey is great here, the star of the show is undoubtedly Juno Temple as Dottie. She has an almost childlike innocence to her which was deeply unnerving (especially as I 'liked' her and she spends a lot of the film naked). Her mannerisms, costume and dialogue gives the impression that she is still a little girl, and she has cute, childlike ticks and behaviours which feels really unsettling given the events surrounding her. Dottie spends most of the film having people do her thinking and she is both overly protected but also led into ghastly situations by those around her. Temple gives an incredible performance. Her accent sounded spot on to me (I had no idea that the actress was English) and she comes into her own later in the film.Other than the great performances of McConaughey and Temple the film is littered with other fantastic actors giving exceptional performances. Thomas Haden Church playing the family's father is brilliant. He is slow talking and slow witted and has little idea what is going on around him. He also provides many of the best comedic moments including the aforementioned one which had the cinema erupting with laughter for several seconds. Gina Gershon is good as the step mother who cares little for her step children and just wants her cut. She gives a brave performance in quite an unusual and sickening scene late on involving fried chicken. Completing the main cast is Emile Hirsch as Chris. Chris is the sort of f*ck-up who you always expect will get his comeuppance but does everything he can to avoid it. He is played well by Hirsch but is overshadowed by the over the top characters and excellent actors around him.William Friedkin's direction is excellent as you'd expect. He doesn't shy away from some graphic violence and equally isn't afraid to show uncomfortable sexual scenes or surprisingly graphic nudity. This was one of the aspects of the film that annoyed my girlfriend but personally I thought it was well placed. (Especially when it concerned Juno Temple). Friedkin is masterful at creating suspense and tension and is helped by McConaughey's slow and deliberate deliverance of his lines as well as a decent twist. The direction is a little rough and ready in places but this gives the film a gritty edge which matches its surroundings. A perfectly polished, shiny frame would feel out of place. I kept wondering how on Earth the film would finish but when it did it was satisfying. I still wanted more but thought it ended in a good place.Killer Joe is a compelling comedy-thriller that has a hint of Coen-esque feel to it. It is deeply disturbing and violent in places and marks a great departure from the normal Matthew McConaughey role. The acting is superb and the story bold.

128,georgep53,"""Killer Joe"" Is Great Adult Entertainment",9,14 August 2012,"You have to admire a film that has guts especially these days with everyone in the motion picture business seemingly terrified of offending somebody. Oscar winner William Friedkin doesn't care whether you're offended or not and he and Tony/Pulitzer winning dramatist Tracy Letts have created as good an in-your-face dark comedy as I've ever seen. ""Killer Joe"" deserves the NC-17 rating and thankfully the filmmakers wouldn't compromise just to get an R from the MPAA. The screenplay by Tracy Letts is an adaptation of his 1993 play of the same name about an intellectually challenged Texas family that needs to raise cash fast if their drug-dealing son is to escape the wrath of a mobster to whom he owes money. In the course of the film Letts masterfully takes us through a twisted maze of tangled motives and unsettling characters always retaining his characteristic sense of humor. Matthew McConaughey gives a great performance as a Dallas police detective whose moonlighting activities bring him into contact with the family. The rest of the cast is excellent: Emile Hirsch, Gina Gershon, Juno Temple and Thomas Haden Church. William Friedkin clearly can still direct a bad-ass, butt-kicking movie and I think ""Killer Joe"" will be considered one of his best. People can criticize the film for being too violent or too lurid but in the wake of an epidemic of massacres including one at a recent movie theater I consider this film a pretty good snapshot of our time.",Killer Joe
129,mr_sharma,There is a intriguing story under this reprehensible collusion,5,16 April 2021,"Killer Joe has been on my list of ""films I need to watch"" for a long time.Finally, in 2021 (10 years after it was released), I watched it.I didn't know what to expect and where the story starts and meanders to, in it's conclusion, is certainly not what I expected.There are some truly disturbing moments in this film.It is a Friedkin film and has the hallmarks of the schlock films of the 70s. Nudity, sexual violence, awful human beings (something like Abel Ferreira's Bad lieutenant)....it's all on display.It seems to have a reasonable cast, a seasoned director and yet parts of this film look like amateur dramatics.Mcnaughey, at that moment in his career, was shaking off that romantic lead he'd been lumbered with and by God did he choose a role that is diametrically opposite to that.So the best way to describe this is to say what American Pie does for gross out humour, this does (a passable job) for gross out drama.It's 2011 not 1971! I'm sure there are other ways of putting across the point than that shown or portrayed in this film.It's weird, the film will linger on beyond it's initial watching. It has that capacity.Yet it is very disturbing and truly reprehensible in parts.It is based on a play and adapted for the screen by the original playwright. You can't tell it's origins I don't think.I honestly don't know what to say. Under the grossness, amateurish turns and unlikeable characters, there is an intriguing drama.Just wish it had been told with a little more nuance rather than the hammer blow method it uses.It is one of those films that will divide. Majority will agree it is way to sexualised and sexually violent (and the pointless nudity?!) but no one will sit on the fence with this one. You either hate it for the way it tells the story, as one of shock exploitation, or love it for exactly that reason in delivering an ""art house"" experience.I'm sitting on the fence. I didn't like the execution but liked the underlying story.If you are one who thinks they are probably going to be offended and not a big art house movie goer, I would avoid it.

He's usually dependable for a simple, one dimensional movies with little substance. He gave a slightly better fare with 2011's 'The Lincoln Lawyer', but with Killer Joe, he has delivered something substantial.Mathew plays the part of Joe Cooper, a police detective who moonlights as a contract killer. The main protagonist, Chris, is a drug dealer who finds himself in serious debt, and with the help of his father, plots out a plan to kill his mom in order to collect on an insurance policy. The story depicts seriously depraved characters, each out to lie, cheat, steal and murder without a pang of conscience. The movie doesn't pull punches either, with graphic violence peppered throughout.I don't want to give out spoilers, but the climactic scene is quite vivid. The buildup to the last minute is masterfully done - the tension mounts up to a spectacular finish. However, I have to say that the last one minute - that could have been done better.

133,MarcusJ13,Run of the mill but often compelling,7,16 July 2012,"I've heard 'Killer Joe' be referred to as a black comedy in some circles and it is a statement I disagree with. The film starts out at an extremely bleak tone, the premise represents dysfunction at its very worst. It is not in a sitcom sense by all means, this is a family very willing to resort to killing to get insurance money. The intriguing aspect is the fact that 'Killer Joe' is a police officer as well. While Matthew McConaughey is not known for his more intimidating roles he certainly carries it well here. While it seemed to take a great deal of time for the character to become fully intimidating he after that time passed he stole the show and you really believed that this was a dangerous man, a man who works for law enforcement no less. The rest of the family were very well cast and totally believable in the roles. They were pathetic when they needed to be and endearing (albeit very rarely) when they needed to be. The flaws may be that some scenes were very abrupt and could have done with more explanation or simple character development. In earlier parts of the film it felt as though some scenes were just served as having the characters be there with the audience fill in the blanks surrounding their personalities and attributes. The key aspect here is the very fact that the audience will not be oblivious and be able to establish these characters quickly. In a different film it would have perhaps taken a different approach and planted more exposition. It was perhaps a strength then for this film in particular. All in all it is a decent film, too dark for a black comedy and only really comedic for a certain kind of humour, a very niche kind in this respect.",Killer Joe
134,plpregent,Twisted redneck story filled with outrageous yet delicious dark humor,7,24 January 2013,"Based upon Tracy Letts' play, William Friedkin's ""Killer Joe"" tells the gritty story of a stereotypical Texan, trailer park, white trash family who hires some twisted-minded cop to kill their mom/ex-wife in order to collect a $50 000 check from insurance. Problem is, that cop wants his share before he commits the murder, but, given the scenario, it's obviously not a possibility. So, as a warranty, Chris (Emile Hirsch) offers Joe his virgin sister, Dottie (Juno Temple). What then unfolds is just a crazy series of events, abuse, and backstabbings...Oh yeah, and somehow, this whole mess ends up being somewhat hilarious at times.Killer Joe tells a very straightforward and simple story. While it does take some strange twists, the main focus remains on the characters, which are somewhat likable, despite being conscienceless monsters, each with a style of their own. As these trashy folks are being revealed as characters, their dirty stereotypical redneck attributes and stories just keep piling up, up to a point where it's both disgusting and funny...without ever being clichéd.The dialogue plays a huge part in this film being a success. It's crude, funny, vulgar, and believable. The performances are all stellar, which is impressive, considering how intense some of the scenes can get at times.Watching this film, you can tell it originally was a play. If you think of how simple the story is, yet how interactions between characters give it some depth and add meat to the bone, you have to take your hat off to the writers. Also, there's these little winks, sometimes very subtle, here and there. For example : the dog that keeps barking at everyone all the time. When we are first introduced to Joe, there is this shot of the dog, quietly staring at Joe with a submissive look on his face. I don't want to give too much away, but the attention to detail within Friedkin's direction also takes this film to another level. This could have been just another depiction of a bunch of twisted rednecks. But it's actually more than just that.Be warned, this film is offensive and mean-spirited. There are scenes in there that will make most people a tad uneasy, to say the least. When ""Killer Joe"" reaches its climax, you'll just find yourself laughing out loud at how messy and chaotic this whole situation has escalated.Killer Joe will not bring you to grey areas emotionally. It's not black or white. It's both black AND white. Disgust and laughter, sometimes blended together, sometimes being the consequence of one another. It does take some slick direction, twisted yet excellent writing, and solid performances to take viewers to these strange, opposite emotional areas.(4) Rating system : (1) Masterpiece, (2) Remarkable, (3) Very Good, (4) Good, (5) Average, (6) Bad, (7) Awful",Killer Joe

139,arminhage,Could be a perfect thriller,6,1 January 2015,"This one could be perfect if the following problems would have been addressed:1. Cinematography: This one was a major blow as the picture quality WAS too high def and polished made it look like a TV movie or a TV show. It gives the audience feel of a cheap B movie.2. Beside Matthew McConaughey and Gina Gershon who did great job as always, other cast offered extremely cheesy plays again amplified the feel of cheap B TV movie. I think if they had not recruited Matthew McConaughey, the movie was doomed. Matthew McConaughey's play was good enough to fade other deficiencies but I regret to see how a near perfect script was made into a movie on the border of A and B instead of being great. This movie had lots of potential.I would say despite the deficiencies, it's highly watchable and a bit controversial, not too long and fast pace which is good, a descent R rated entertainment but nothing special. 6/10",Killer Joe

142,yaktheripper,Compensate for the knee jerk,9,27 October 2012,"Sometimes a performance in itself can boost a movies value and vault it into something spectacular, McConaughey provides the turbo to this otherwise solid but not groundbreaking vehicle of karmic retribution as Killer Joe. The movie itself has been said to be akin to Friedkin aping a Cohen crime caper and that description works. We have a crime masterminded by selfish, unintelligent and or quirky characters, we have the mid-west as our backdrop, and we have the metaphysical shadow of karma hovering over their every move throughout the film. Call it Cohen Brothers on whiskey. The characters themselves are all very stereotyped but I think Friedkin left that transparent enough. In other words, the stereotype was part of the wardrobe itself. The reason being is this is not about these characters in particular...this is about choices and consequences and Killer Joe is simply a vehicle of karmic arithmetic. All that aside, on any day, or in any movie, McConaughey's performance as Killer Joe is mesmerizing. He is the serpent...cold and dangerous but charming and in control, constantly. He weaves his restrained psychotic energy through the movie as if he was born to play this role. For as silly as this movie can be, this is a brutally adult movie. It is graphic and there is a barrel of bush in it. There is also an almost misogynistic undertone that I don't wish to defend one way or the other, but I will say that for the scenes to not play out as they did would be an injustice to the character that McConaughey plays. The cast all around is very solid. Thomas Haden Church is pretty terrific, Gershon is on point and I've never been happier to see her answer a door. Juno Temple is a lolita-ish young vixen who seems to be almost in a different plane of existence throughout the movie. This is a movie that will stick with you after it's over, the mark of a truly good movie. There's mechanics below the surface that have to be thought about and you have to discipline yourself for the eventual knee jerking that is bound to happen. Adults only.

144,thefilmdiscussion,"""Killer Joe"" is one of Friedkin and McConaughey's finest moments",9,12 September 2012,"William Friedkin's (The Exorcist, The French Connection) latest film is a masterful blend of dark comedy, nail-biting suspense, and unflinchingly brutal violence and sex. Killer Joe stars Matthew McConaughey as a Texas officer of the law who moonlights as a contract killer. For a cool $25,000 he'll kill anybody you ask him to, no questions asked. For Emile Hirsch and his messed-up, trailer-trash family (Thomas Haden Church, Juno Temple, Gina Gershon) that means killing his mother, so that his little sister Dottie can collect on the insurance policy, so that he can pay off a drug money debt before he gets whacked. Unfortunately for all involved, Joe only takes cash up front. Seems like they're all screwed until Joe lays eyes on the virginal Dottie, and decides he'll take her as a retainer until the money comes in. As if this story weren't messed up enough already. As the plot twists and turns around the desolate small town landscape, the characters have changes of heart that put kinks in the original deal. It all leads to a final act that is so bizarre and outrageous it landed the film a hefty NC-17 rating. You may never eat a drumstick again. The film is expertly crafted by a talented director and an ensemble cast at the top of their game, not the least of which is McConaughey as the titular character, easily one of his finest, most daring roles, played with steely intensity. I'm hoping Oscar will knock on his door.

Killer Joe is no exception. At age of 76, director William Friedkin still knows how to deliver a raw, dark, edgy film that's so out there it will have you puzzled about what you actually just saw. The movie is an all out comedy but not your obvious typical kind. It's comedy William Friedkin style. Killer Joe is a True Masterpiece. Matthew McConaughey gives the performance of his career in a haunting, terrifying portrayal of a law enforcement officer who's also a professional murderer on the side. The rest of the cast turn in top notch performances as well. This is Friedkin's first film in six years since he made Bug in 2006, which was also written by Tracy Letts. If you're a Friedkin fan or in the mood for something fresh away from Comic Book movies and remakes then contact Killer Joe. However, side effects may include murder, loss of money, perjury, and debt.

147,pampowell5,Killer Joe Slayed Me!,8,9 August 2012,"I wasn't quite sure why the poster for ""Killer Joe"" was of fried chicken in the shape of the state of Texas. OK. I get the Texas thing, but the fried chicken? Why? Am I out of it and don't realize that Texas is known for its fried chicken? No. (Well, I may be a bit out of it, but not in that way!) It became crystal clear toward the end of the movie why they chose fried chicken. Oh, my!Tracy Letts, a well-known Chicago actor and playwright, has written his first feature film, ""Killer Joe."" Initially, ""Killer Joe"" was an off-Broadway production which ran for 9 months in 1998. I went to this movie not realizing this was Letts' production. Had I have known that, I would have sought it out earlier. I remembered seeing the trailers which described a few rednecks wanting to kill a mother for insurance money. The killer for hire was none other than Matthew McConaughey. (Perfect casting, but I'll talk more about that later.) Back to the premise of the movie...The adult son, Chris, played by Emile Hirsch, apparently was up to his neck in gambling debts with no way to pay up. This was Bad Decision Number 1. After Chris' total loser and redneck father turned him away, he devised a scheme to collect enough money to be free of his debtors: kill mom for the insurance money. (Bad Decision Number 2) You're saying to yourself, ""C'mon. This is an all too common theme."" Yes, you're correct, however, you need to trust me on this one. It's never been done quite like this. There was so much irony involved in the plot development that I was laughing out loud. Then the chips continued to fall where they did eliciting Bad Decision Number 3, 4, 5...I'm not sure where it ended. You could just see how these decisions spiraled out of control. As I said before, Matthew McConaughey played the smarmy, cut throat killer/police officer (interesting combination), Killer Joe Cooper. I truly think this was one of McConaughey's best performances. This role required him to be cold, charming, smart, heartless, beguiling, repulsive and scary all wrapped up into one handsome package. Emile Hirsch played the dumb hick Chris who never learned anything, but had a love for his stunted sister and always protected her...except when he needed money. Thomas Hayden Church played the loser dad with an IQ no higher than a brick wall and a heart made of the same consistency. Gina Gershon rounded out this perfect cast with her tenacity, grit, and the ability to look and act like a hussy. Her performance was probably the most difficult of all the actors as she portrayed a woman who has fewer morals than Britney Spears, yet she still made you have empathy for her! (Sorry to you Britney fans!)This was a sick and twisted plot from the beginning. I'll make no bones about that. (You'll laugh later at this reference.) It was also physically repulsive with the onslaught of surprising violence which made me cringe, pull my knees up to my face to help my hands cover my eyes and then utter many words that I probably shouldn't even type! (Sorry to that sweet couple sitting next to me!) That being said, I also laughed...a lot! This was a smart, entertaining, captivating and well-done dark comedy. Please emphasize the word ""dark!"" This movie is NOT for everyone. I really liked it, but it left me disturbed, shaky, and unnerved. As I went into the elevator at the Century Landmark Theater (I was too shaky to walk the stairs), comments such as, ""Wow!"" and ""Oh, my God!"" along with, ""That was the best dark comedy I have ever seen!"" could be heard. Yes, I would agree with them all. (I might even throw in a few expletives!)",Killer Joe
148,k-thomas,Sickening rubbish.,1,24 August 2016,"This has got to be one of the most disgusting films i have ever seen. If people can call this entertainment is beyond belief and especially from a director like William Friedkin. A young man is heavily in debt to a gangster. He comes up with the idea of hiring a hit-man to kill his own mother because she has a life insurance policy for $50,000. He has heard of a man named Killer Joe, who is also a police officer who will do it for $20,000. An appointment with the killer is made and his fee is $25000, but he can only pay when the policy is cashed. The killer first of all refuses, but changes his mind, because he has the hots for the young mans sister, so he decides to have an affair with the sister until the money is paid. Both his father and daughter are involved in the plot as his father is now living with another woman who is an alcoholic. I won""t spoil the rest of the so called story.1] Would a hit-man announce that he is a police officer? 2.After he pays the hit-man the $25,000, $25,000 is left to be split between his Stepmother, Father, his sister and himself which i $6,166 each. 3] Out of his share, i ask, how much is this heavy debt? After the murder, we are then for the rest of the film, subjected to some of the most sickening violence i have ever seen. Years ago Hollywood complained about the violence in Sam Peckinpah""s movies. My only criticism of Peckinpah was his treatment of women in his films, but the violence towards women in Killer Joe, makes the rape scene in Straw Dogs look like a kissing scene from a Walt Disney film.

Emile Hirsch, Gina Gershon, and Thomas Hadon Church, fill out their well written and convincingly awful characters, but Matthew McConaughey beats the hell out of the film.

150,coiffuremixte,killer film,10,25 September 2012,"Killer Joe is a visceral experience. From the jarring opening:lightening, mad dog barking, full frontal nudity, to the final image the viewer is grabbed by the throat and involved. The filmmaker's interest and success is in daring the viewer, in provoking a reaction, in challenging the voyeuristic dynamic inherent in film in the way Hitchcock and Powell did in Vertigo, Rear Window or Peeping Tom. To go back to that opening moment when Emile Hirsch's character is confronted by his stepmother's vagina when he finally gains access to the trailer and the story can begin; what is important is the reaction he has to this exhibitionism, the repulsion he expresses and the anger, why should he react this way when very soon afterward he brings his father to a strip bar to conduct a conversation about conspiracy to murder? The reason is simple: the context, the intent. His stepmother is provoking him with her nudity, as far as he is concerned. The theme of misogyny is clearly close to the director and can be traced most obviously to The Exorcist where the expression of paranoia related to feminine sexuality is at its most blatant. All of the characters in Killer Joe are morally bankrupt, their quest for a cash payout at any cost is translated into an apocalyptic vision of humanity and consumerism. This is hell on earth and Killer Joe is Satan. What fills the film in its comic horror is the struggle for power that all the zombies on show enact. The Coen brothers movies cover similar ground, in Fargo or The Man Who Wasn't There, or The Big Lebowski, the difference between Friedkin's film and their output is that in Killer Joe we don't get the comfort of sitting back and watching at a comfortable intellectual distance, we are implicated emotionally and physically, viscerally. In a schematic analysis Killer Joe - in its semi-theatrical form and 'torture' scene, and the truly unpleasant protagonists at each other's throat for immorally gained loot - is reminiscent of Reservoir Dogs with the blend of violence and black comedy; the trip to hell is great fun, just remember to come back with your soul intact. The actors clearly relish the freedom they are given and each gives the best (or worst morally) of themselves to help make the film the disturbing triumph it is.Friedkin is a master at filming the impossible, the unbearable, the un-filmable while remaining an artist who is involved morally in the stories he tells.

The acting was top-notch, the set designs (limited as they were) were elegantly done. Matthew McCounaughey in the titular role seems to want to break away from his sex icon image and he does...and then some. He may well be as vicious and cruel as Darret Gillahunt's Krug from The Last House on the Left. But what stands out is English actress Juno Temple's dead-pan, child-like redneck sister performance. It's quite something, and after a bloody climax you hope that she'll go on to do even bigger and better things. FX's American Horror Story showcases that kind of talent (take the cast of all three seasons: Jessica Lange, James Cromwell, Kathy Bates, Angela Basset, Taissa Farmiga to name just a few). When Juno pulls the trigger you kind of wish you'd see her on board for something like that. She's done quite a good amount of interesting movies, but seeing her in something truly epic like AHS would be kick-ass. All in all, watch it for her performance.",Killer Joe
156,geodrake-71-627198,Mostly Killer!,7,4 July 2012,"This black comedy is the big screen adaptation of synonymous play by famous author Tracy Letts. Fittingly enough the first version of the play was staged at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 1994, as the U.K. Premier Gala was held to open the Edinburgh International Film Festival in 2012. Director William Freidkin describes the film as being about 'All the Old Testament vanities' (I.E. sins), which is appropriate given the plot. Chris Smith, played by Emile Hirsch gets into debt to a local drug dealer after Chris' alcoholic mother sells the stash of cocaine he was meant to be selling on. A furious Chris goes to see his none too bright father Ansel (Thomas Haden Church) and step mom Sharla (Gina Gershon). Together they hatch a scheme to have Chris' mother killed so the insurance company will pay out on her large life policy. If successful, the money will go to Chris' sister Dotty (Juno Temple), an unusual girl who lives in her own little world. The others would then convince her to split the windfall four ways, after paying the assassin's fee. At a friend's suggestion, Chris hires 'Killer Joe', a Police Detective who moonlights as a hit-man. Matthew McConaughey is cast as Joe, in a radical departure from his usual mainstream roles. When the Smiths can't afford to pay Joe upfront like he insists, it looks like the plan will fall through. Joe comes up with a solution. Instead of a retainer, the Smiths can give him Dottie, whom he became infatuated with at first sight, as collateral. Dottie's father and step mom engineer a 'date' between her and Joe and soon he moves into their trailer to take full advantage of his new plaything. Chris grows increasingly horrified by what's happening to his sister, especially as she seems to have fallen for Joe. But he leaves it too late to try and stop the deal. Events turn increasingly violent as Chris tries to rescue Dottie from Joe's possession before he takes her away forever and Sharla's loyalty is called into question.Being based on a play, most of the film is driven by quick-fire, sharp dialogue. Ansel provides a lot of the humour due to his sheer stupidity and Haden Church gives a gleeful turn as the greedy redneck. Gina Gershon is almost unrecognisable as 'trailer trash' Sharla. Her performance is so convincing that seeing her at the gala premier dressed in finery was incongruous. It was also a bit embarrassing as a few minutes into the feature there's a close up shot of her naked crotch! Dotty, a pivotal character in the plot is brought to life by Juno Temple. She mixes sweetness with an unpredictable dark undercurrent in a way that makes her fascinating to watch. Emile Hirsch is a capable actor; he was brilliant as Cleve Jones in 2008 biopic 'Milk'. Yet the last time I saw him was in execrable 2011 Sci-Fi flick 'The Darkest Hour'. Here he steps up to the plate again and is excellent portraying Chris' internal struggle as he has to decide whether to support a scheme that will make him rich for the price of whoring out the sister he loves. Matthew McConaughey is to be commended for taking another decent character as he continues to shed his pretty boy image. 'Joe' is a role requiring charisma, sleazy charm and brutal menace. On the whole McConaughey pulls it off; the sequence involving him, Gershon and a piece of fried chicken will stick in your mind long after you watch it. But he lacks some of the natural screen presence that someone like Woody Harrelson could have provided. As director, Freidkin sticks to what he does best; building tension to an explosive finale, keeping things moving at a decent pace and getting the most out of his cast. Whilst not up there with his crowning glory 'The French Connection', he shows us that he is more than capable of making a movie reminiscent of the Cohen Brothers' early work. 'Killer Joe' is darkly amusing and brutal in equal measures with strong characters played by a sterling cast. It doesn't deliver anything particularly groundbreaking and in spite of the pornographic violence and degradation it isn't actually that shocking for the most part; perhaps because the bar on what's shocking is set so high these days.",Killer Joe

What is the world view of Letts? Well, on the basis of this film, based on an old play by Letts, pretty negative and more or less encapsulated in the electric last half hour of the movie: human beings are perverted scum busy destroying each other. If you don't share that world view you might not like the movie, or at least that last half hour, which includes the infamous fried chicken scene which, if not exactly shocking, is certainly disturbing. It's all very well acted, especially Matthew McConaughey, and the photography is good. But to be honest, the first hour of the film was a bit boring. It's supposedly a black comedy, but there aren't many jokes, although there is an element of the absurd. I suppose what the film/play really wants to do is be shocking for the sake of it, there is no grand purpose to it, no intellectual meaning, or philosophy, until the sheer nihilism of that last half hour.",Killer Joe

160,ashturner-79373,"A well-acted and directed black comedy, with lots of taboo.",7,14 February 2019,"Something I respect about this film is the way it makes a cast of mostly despicable characters likeable. They're basically a family of abusive, back-stabbing, amoral trailer trash, and yet the chemistry they share with one another, their often deadpan delivery of crazy dialogue, and their complete lack of moral compass all make them enjoyable to be around. This is helped by some very strong performances, particularly from Juno Temple and Matthew McConaughey.The premise of killing someone for their life insurance is hardly original, but that's basically just a canvas for these characters to fill. Their situation escalates quite naturally until it reaches a ridiculous (but incredibly enjoyable) breaking point during the final scene, which lasts an intense 20 minutes or so. I also like the scene where Chris' employer Digger confronts him and has him beaten, after which Joe (a police detective) reveals that he knows and even likes Digger (a local gang boss).The use of country music, like ""Strokin'"" by Clarence Carter over the end credits, sets the scene well. The film looks lovely, with particularly atmospheric lighting during nighttime scenes. I also like some of the more abstract moments that we see from Chris' perspective, like when he has an oddly sexual dream about his sister Dottie or when he sees Adele's car exploding on TV.This is a black comedy, in which most of the humour comes from two places. One is the morally dubious nature of everything that happens, and the way the characters talk and act during the whole thing. The other is the twisted family dynamic, and the way in which Joe inserts himself - this is best shown during the final moments, as the family lie around covered in blood, in various states of injury, while Dottie declares that she's having Joe's baby.I will say that there are issues with dialogue, which sometimes feels aimless or unfunny. Nevertheless, this is an enjoyable black comedy with a very unique cast of characters.7/10.",Killer Joe

162,jerrywilson,"A Disturbing, Freaky, Hilarious Film",9,3 September 2012,"Maybe I'm projecting here but I think this film has a socio-political message, and one I fully subscribe to. If you are a conservative redneck, you'll probably like this movie because you can identify with the characters. If you are a proud Texan, you won't like it because it does your state no favors. And if you are a progressive, you might like it because of how it portrays redneck Texans and because of the veiled slap at the Pro-Life conservatives at the end of the film. Here is a movie where none of the characters have any respect for human life except for that of the unborn as revealed when Dottie says she is pregnant at the very end of the movie. It's the first time Joe has smiled in the entire story. It's a dark comedy, very dark. It's also disturbingly violent in places, as well as being misogynistic. The most disturbing scene involves fellatio with a chicken leg from K-Fried-C that substitutes for an attached penis. There are hints of a near-incestuous relationship between Chris and his sister, Dottie. Dottie is beautiful, though a bit disturbed. But who wouldn't be living the way she lives with a father who cares nothing for her (to the point where he is fine with offering her as a ""retainer"" to Joe for services rendered), and a step-mother who respects her so little that she walks around the house naked in front of her. Chris seems to care more about her than anyone else in the family, including her real mother who, as she relates, tried to kill her when she was a baby. But again, there is that feeling that something isn't quite normal between them. Well, they did sleep together when they were children. Maybe they did more than just sleep.I gave this a 9 for being funny, intriguing, thought-provoking, and for going where few movies have the guts to go. If you don't get offended easily, you should see it. It's a movie you will be thinking about for days. And if you're a woman, you may never eat chicken again.",Killer Joe
163,latakiahaze,"Rather dull thriller, stagey with artsy pretensions",4,28 October 2014,"Really, I don't know what all the fuss is about. There are far more repulsive characters in Rob Zombie's The Devils Rejects, and far more shocking scenes in (the remake of) Last House on The Left.Rather a turgid script, some OK performances, but overall a lacklustre attempt at shock value. I do agree with those who have written: what is the point of this movie?I found the movie very dull to start and was tempted not to complete it. However, coming back onto IMD and hearing it was supposed to be some sort of grand guignol masterpiece managed to sit through the second half. Really - if anyone thinks this is anything new or especially shocking they should perhaps aquaint themselves with Shakespeare - try Titus Andronicus for a start, where the bodies litter the stage!I could not find any salient comments on class, gender or anything, just a generally messed-up plot featuring characters we would rather not empathise with. No, I don't think this is especially misogynistic, just rather clumsily written.This is certainly no southern Gothic masterpiece, as some have said. As to the ""humour"" - sorry, but I must have missed that (the only funny line for me was when Joe is talking about the guy who incinerated his genitals). Really a very strange piece. I don't know what Friedkin was thinking about when he took this one on, I suspect ""shock"" but for my money it fails miserably in that regard.Ultimately I suspect the script lets this down as Friedkin is a bang-on director. He must look for far better material and realise that shock value is not the only colour in the film makers palette.Very disappointing from the director of ""The Exorcist"".",Killer Joe

My film choices are superb (in my opinion) but ""Blue Velvet"" did not go down well. So....... when the dark violent humour started springing up in Killer Joe - I started to worry.I think it worked well because the film took the time to flesh out all the characters so you cared about what happened to them. It's really a bit of a ""blokes"" flick with the storyline and scene set ups. So good to see it can also appeal to a mature lady as well. Nice little ""trailer trash scheme goes astray flick"" and well worth a watch. KFC will never taste the same again.....How comes a great director like Friedkin only has a handful of reviews on his latest outing?

165,malaysian1789,Is Killer Joe a good thriller?,8,29 June 2012,"I have been anticipating Killer Joe for a while now, it reminded me of No Country For Old Men, it looked like a gritty thriller, made even more interesting with the casting of Matthew McConaughey in the lead role, a man I associate with poor romantic comedies that usually star J-Lo.The story is set in Texas and concerns a young man Chris (played by Emile Hersch), who, owing money to local gangsters, decides to hire a Hit-man aptly named ''Killer Joe'' (McConaughey) to kill his mother and claim life insurance. Yes. His own Mother. Chris is also, with the agreement of his father and step-mother, allowing his sister to be ''kept'' by Joe as a means of initial payment for the killing. Basically, the most dysfunctional family ever. But things turn even more sour soon, as we see all is not as it seems with the deal.......Firstly, acting in this film is great, McConaughey is convincing as a killer with authority, as is Emile Hersch as the redneck son who will do anything for money, both actors seem to be optimistically intent on getting an Oscar. The pace of the film is very slow and tense, it engages the audience and blends the violence with a lot of dark comedy, which I liked. If anything, the major flaw is the story itself, which starts off well but soon becomes chaotic and confused, as if they cut out loads of scenes and randomly stuck the rest together to save time. However, for the most part it works as a good and enjoyable film. Only avoid if you are offended by graphic violence/nudity.",Killer Joe

It is the poverty story with a lot of violence. Rednecks life, debts, infidelity, virginity sold.I discovered it was a play. Probably with less violence. But even so, the story could not get me interested in more than five minutes.I watched until the end to see if there was some grand finale, but there was only more violence, misogyny and blood.Really I can't believe anymore in IMDb rates.What a waste of time, cast and money.

Much of the ""human"" race needs to be ""cleansed."" There are a lot of guys out there who love to see women humiliated and treated badly in porn. After the way Creepy Joe treats Juno Temple's character I was thinking this is the most misogynistic thing I have ever seen...(BEFORE the chicken leg scene I thought this.) The message was clear: women like to be ordered around. Just make them scared and they will fall in love with you. (In reality a normal woman would just attack you or run away because they'd think you're a rapist.) Well, let's up it a notch then and give you something 10 times more misogynistic: The scene where Gina Gershon is forced to give a blowjob to a chicken leg. WELL DONE. Now it's not just creepy, it's officially misogynist porn. But, you know she ""deserved"" it for cheating on her husband and trying to scam money. The message: Women are snakes. Later, Dottie panics and starts shooting random people in her family for no reason. The message: Women are dumb. Gina and Juno should be ashamed for humiliating themselves like this and for contributing to this asshole mentality. In a way it's worse than porn because more people will see it. Now, for the other reason why this movie was brought down to a 1/10. They bring the movie up to a climax and then: black screen. Why? You don't stop reading a book in the middle of a cliffhanger and then just chuck it into a fire do you?

There wasn't a single person I cared about or a single line of dialogue that was interesting or well written.I gather that this is supposed to be one of those ""clever"" dark movies where you can expect to be shocked but in the end love it because of the uniqueness and intelligence of the script. It isn't. The characters are boring, the plot is boring, the twist at the end is boring..quite frankly this could have been written by M. Night Shyamalan it is so boringly bad. Any shock to be found is there for the sake of shock - not for an actual purpose.I don't understand at all comments by other IMDb folks going on about what a brilliant opus this is and how Friedkin ""is back!"" - as if he has done anything of note in the last 30 years (he hasn't). The man who wrote the script is no better. Tracy Letts has a smallish acting career playing minor parts and his writing career has even less to say for itself. If this movie is the grand high showpiece for Friedkin or Letts, perhaps it's time to find another career for the both of them.If you enjoy movies with lots of nudity and violence and aren't big on cleverness, good writing or intelligent directing - this is the movie for you.

I really think the dark humour in this movie is brilliant... and each character is given near same amount of screen time and attention to detail is amazing. Joe was still a mysterious person, and thats what makes his character so interesting and I even found myself respecting him because he keeps his word unlike this family he is dealing with. We have a fantastic actor veteran cast, acting is done to perfection, and I don't think it would have been nearly as great without these actors especially Matthew. I like how this is different than most dark comedies especially in respect to the fact the characters are not 1 dimensional. We are suppose to find them unpleasant but most movies like this genre make you hate the characters too much (such as the case of BABY DRIVER) this story is simplistic yet the depiction and interaction of the characters is what makes the movie good because even though they are flawed they make attempts to still be human right up until the very end, which makes the ending so dark yet hilarious.",Killer Joe

Everybody else done there part surprisingly very good (everybody suited to there character perfectly) and even after few minutes you will be drawn into this unusual story and there ordinary, repeating, dull and savage life.

I also suspect that another motivation was to portray white people from texas as horrible poor trash. The ""woke"" left love to portray themselves as enlightened and people from the south as ignorant.
Finally I think the left is always attempting to outdo each other in terms of being shocking. They believe it makes them look clever I suppose.

It definitely earned the NC-17 rating and I was impressed with the films flow.The film maker made an incredible film that showed a different perspective and had subtle shocks woven in. Scenes were disturbing because they had realistic ""sign of the times"" brutality. It was worth seeing, though I am not sure I would want to watch it a second time.

175,cjmccracken,Friedkin's Southern Gothic Masterpiece,9,1 December 2012,"Killer Joe is the new movie from William Friedkin, one of the most revered and important directors of the last 50 years. A Southern Gothic tale of a hired killer and the most reprehensible family to grace the screen since reality TV was established, it follows the trials and misfortunes of a young man named Chris Smith (Emile Hirsch) as he tries to relieve himself of a considerable debt which he owes to a local kingpin (Marc Macaulay). The movie opens with Chris banging on the door of his father's trailer in the middle of a rain drenched night, only to be greeted by the semi naked form of his father's new partner Sharla (Gina Gershon) who reluctantly lets him in. His father Ansel (Thomas Haden Church) is a bumbling and perpetually apathetic man who would seemingly always prefer to be elsewhere, contemplation of any kind seems to cause him great discomfort and the arrival of his son in a frantic and panicked state causes only disconcertion and irritation. His appearance is, however, central to the subsequent events which unfold. He piques his father's interest by alerting him to the fact that his estranged wife (whom up until recently Chris was living with) has recently taken out an extensive and sizeable life insurance policy, one which could set them both up for life, were she to meet with an unfortunate and seemingly accidental death. Enter the titular Killer Joe Cooper played with slickness and formidable intimidation by Matthew McConaughey in a role which has, undoubtedly, caused surprise and amazement amongst those who would have dismissed him as an actor capable only of romantic comedies and similarly light hearted fare. Killer Joe agrees to facilitate the disappearance of Chris' mother, but is infuriated by the fact that Chris has attempted to avail of his services without the necessary funds which were a prerequisite of their meeting. Agreeing to take the company of Ansel and Sharla's heartbreakingly innocent daughter Dottie (Juno Temple) as a retainer, everything seems to be going well. This, however, being a William Friedkin movie will not allow such things to happen. The astounding levels of tension which the director achieves are juxtaposed with claustrophobic and striking cinematography, a superb score and hugely admirable performances from all involved. It becomes a thrilling and stimulating character study of the low-down, the desperate and the broken. A sleaziness permeates every motive, action and thought of the characters in the world of Killer Joe, with each individual out for whatever they can take. McConaughey's Joe Cooper commands attention whenever he is on screen; his larger than life reputation is darkly personified whenever he enters the room (or trailer). The storyline, adapted from Tracey Letts' 1993 play of the same name, maintains all of the dramatic tension of a theatre performance, whilst making an effortless transition to the big screen. Friedkin is well versed in the world of horror (it shouldn't need mentioning that he is the man who brought us The Exorcist in 1973) and has previously collaborated with Letts on the highly underrated 2006 psychological black comedy Bug. The griminess of Killer Joe is, at times, reminiscent of The French Connection (1971) and Cruising (1980), alluding to the on- screen brutality which ran through 2003's The Hunted. It's also hilarious in parts. A scene in which a rather brutal beating is played out to the soundtrack of Clarence Carter's 'Strokin' is one particularly brilliant turn, as is another very commonly alluded to moment involving a chicken drumstick.A magnificent offering from a fantastic writer / director team, Killer Joe is a movie which works on a vast array of levels. It's visceral, intelligent and exceptionally well made. A delight which I will be revisiting many times in the near future.

'killer joe' is more of a educated character which brings a good contrast to said family. but he is also mean and evil, nonetheless with developed (but disturbing) ethics. quite interesting really. some good lines, and very good acting from McConaughey. two scenes with him are outstanding. speaking of the acting: i loved it. the cast is a perfect choice.i won't go into details of the story, which is quite simple. the story is not what makes this movie interesting. but it has a nice twist which i didn't see coming.the camera work is great.the setting is well chosen and they did pay attention to the details.i also liked the fact that the blood and injuries were not very realistically done. i don't like to see realistic violence. and whoever does should consider therapy. but that's just my opinion.which brings me to the ending: unfortunately this has messed up the movie for me. it was unnecessarily violent (unlike the rest of the movie) and did not add anything useful to the movie. i am only talking about the last 90 seconds. they really could have done a lot more with that. it seems like whoever wrote this couldn't think of a good ending, then got really drunk and just took the first idea that came to mind.i rate it 6. with a proper ending it could have been 7-8. too bad.",Killer Joe

182,will51224,Like nothing you've ever seen,10,14 August 2012,"When I went to see Killer Joe, I hadn't been so pumped to see a movie since The Dark Knight. Maybe it was because it got excellent reviews and had a great cast. Maybe it was because it was the first time I headed into the city to see a film in limited release. Maybe it was because it was the first NC-17 rated movie I'd be seeing in theaters. Maybe it was all of the above.I thoroughly enjoyed Killer Joe, so much so that I can't remember the last time I was so satisfied with a film. One of the best things about it was the performances of its stellar cast, including the title character. It would be a crime for Matthew McConaughey not to get nominated for an Oscar, or at least a Golden Globe (which he's more likely to get). He really impressed me, even after seeing him in serious roles, such as The Lincoln Lawyer and A Time to Kill. Sure, he does a lot of shitty romcoms, but when he's in a good movie, damn is he good. He pulled off playing a manipulative, sadistic villain so well that I almost found myself rooting for him, especially since compared to the screwed up family, he didn't seem all that bad. But I've already said too much. And trust me, as I've heard others say, the less you know about this film going in, the better, which is why I'll keep the plot summary as simple as possible.Emile Hirsh plays Chris, a Texan drug dealer who finds himself in considerable debt. He consults his father Ansel (Thomas Haden Church) about hiring detective-slash-contract-killer-on-the-side Joe Cooper to kill Chris' deadbeat mother in order to obtain a $50,000 insurance policy, which will go to Chris' younger sister, Dottie (Juno Temple). Because Chris can't afford to pay Joe's mandatory $25,000 up front fee, Joe allows his rule to slide in exchange for keeping Dottie on ""retainer"" until he can get his money. The always sexy (even when she's playing white trash) Gina Gershon rounds out the cast as Sharla, Ansel's second wife and Chris and Dottie's stepmother.I seek out different, shocking films, and boy, did this one deliver. The violence is nothing that hasn't been seen in many R-rated movies. In fact, it was even less violent than many of them. What makes it so disturbing in this film is how real the violence is. It's one thing to be accustomed to over-the-top violence in movies such as Sin City or the Kill Bill films. It's another thing to be shocked by brutally realistic violence. Director William Friedkin, of The Exorcist fame, really takes you into the gritty reality of southern life for some people. It was actually filmed in New Orleans, but you'd never know that because Friedkin paints such a convincing depiction of redneck Texas.What really makes this film earn its NC-17 rating is the overtly sexual nature and overall tone. The filmmakers tried to appeal the rating, but when they were rejected by the MPAA, they decided to release the film uncut. I respect them for that because it shows that they didn't care about the movie being able to make more money. They value art over profit, and the movie benefits from their decision. The same shock value wouldn't be there if they had toned it down to an R.This film had me laughing in obviously funny places, and in some other places where I almost questioned why I was laughing. Almost. Some of the wicked plot twists and bold, daring turns will leave your jaw hanging open. It's like no other film you've ever seen, and most likely will never see again.",Killer Joe

Great cliffhanger ending... Which I like, because I like to decide or imagine what will happen after the audience is given enough information. I would have liked a little more scenery and backdrop of Dallas, but cinematography was good non-the-less. It left the audience feeling a bit dirty and dark, but gave enough humor for good balance.

Friedkin has been known for his output of hit'n misses, and here he might well have got a hit had he employed the idiosyncratic Michael Shannon in the title role who performed so well in Friedkin's previous outing Bug. If he had done that he may well have pulled it off. As it is, Killer Joe lacks punch and general creepiness, which is the whole idea behind Mahogany's character.

I was enjoying the movie until it begins building to a point where it was uncomfortable to watch the exploitation of a young girl by a father-aged culprit. We are never told exactly how old she is- but she could be as young as 16, so I found this part of the story a problem.The violence is average, movie-level action until a few scenes where it becomes too much and disturbing. I'm sorry that our culture now finds this stuff acceptable and entertaining. I'm 59 years old and no prude, but it seems that Hollywood keeps pushing their content to places that used to be simply wrong. The millennial crowd are becoming desensitized to this and I'm sure that the younger, school aged crowd are as well. This film is not for them, but I know they watch.

People will talk about how it is a piece of art, but for me it was a total piece of something else. This is a director's and actor's film. A vanity project to show how much they can stretch their talents. I'm sure other actors and directors will find it interesting, however, for the movie goer it provides little. There is no reason to watch this film other than perhaps to see how much you can endure.The movie is based on a play by Tracy Letts and directed by William Friedkin. It's set in Texas and tells the story of life of a trailer park family affected by drugs and gambling debts. A scheme is developed to get money to repay some mobsters to stop them killing the son. Things just spiral out of control in a series of ultra-violent events.I wanted to leave the cinema because it was just so depressingly sick. I actually felt sorry for the actors. However I stayed to see what the director was going to say after the film. Surprisingly he was a very engaging speaker.

An uncompromising film that allows Friedkin to showcase all the tricks he has acquired throughout his extensive career. With clever casting lead by the flawless McConaughey, Killer Joe is a dark and twisted story that draws the viewer into the sordid truth of human morality.

188,obiwayne,Dark and disturbing study of the seedier side of America,7,31 July 2013,"Killer Joe is an interesting study of the seedier side of life and how far some will go for a paltry sum of $7500 or less. McConaughey gives one of the best performances of his career and the supporting cast keeps up. Director William Friedkin makes a few choices I didn't love (i.e. the dream by Chris of Dottie naked in the hall seemed out of place) but overall handled the source material with a tight and expert touch. Since it is based on a play, the story is very dialog driven and a lesser director could have easily let that get away from them. It's also worth noting that I was pleasantly surprised at Thomas Haden Church's performance and felt he added more to the story than anticipated. It's not for the faint hearted or easily offended, especially the last 15 minutes or so and the abuse doled out to Sharla for her transgressions. I would probably not recommend this to many people unless I knew them well and felt like they could handle it.",Killer Joe

Honestly,I wouldn't normally pick this movie for a cinema night. Anyhow, the movie itself is good. Starts slow then it gets better and better. Also, for me there were too many unnecessary nude scenes, didn't add anything to the drama sometimes.Acting is good, sometimes too much but generally good. So in short, it's a nice watch if you are not expecting much, quite night movie with dinner and you are fine but clearly it's not ""made my day"" movie. The end seemed a bit tacky but again, it's not a bad movie.. just don't pay 10 euros or so to watch it. wait until it's on TV or something.",Killer Joe
191,boneugen,Gak...,6,9 May 2013,"This would be the general tone of the movie in my opinion.It is like a triad of ""gak""s. You feel a ""gak"" in your throat when all the violence comes in, and it's here to stay. You might feel a ""gak"" screaming for freedom when everything going on between the film's characters goes darker than night itself. And, ultimately, it's a ""gak"" for the suffocating tone of the film.Call it a comedy of errors, then it is a comedy of big, ugly errors. Starting with the family junior Chris's decision to gather big dough from the murder of a person whom he realizes he didn't know very well in his short life, and ending with doublecrossing wifey Sharla messing with the wrong kind of guy and also Chris trying to confront an evil that proves itself to be much greater than he had expected, it's all red and black, with no other colour sandwiched inbetween. And in the center of the whole storm, stands the merciless, ruthless, and almost otherworldly character of Killer Joe. McConaughey surely does pull out a performance in this movie, both comical and frightening in his lack of vocal inflexions, acting more like a very uncomfortable presence, impossible to eliminate, than a human being. With the exception of his love for Dottie, which blossoms nonetheless in most sordid circumstances. Nobody is able to escape his revenge in the little town he's watching over.It's not a pleasant ride by any means, and oddly enough, it's not a film that I would come back to. It's all perfectly produced, the acting is very fine, but there is something that makes it feel a little bit rushed... Or maybe it's just the very, very demoralizing ending that all things come to. Good to see especially for McConaughey's acting, but I guess it remains more of a curiosity needing to be satisfied than an enduring work of filmmaking.",Killer Joe

There is plenty of all three and the violence is at times unremitting. But these features are not gratuitous - they are part and parcel of the setting, plot and character development and the film would not be what it is without them, especially as it is based on a play - if you are expecting to get a good look at life in Texas, you will be disappointed as pretty much everything takes place indoors. But what does take place will have you glued to the screen. Most of your personal problems will fade away as you find yourself enrapt by the almost surreal problems and solutions the characters have to deal with. I should also mention that the actors were superb. They must have been drained after a day's work. But for some strange reason when the movie ended I snapped out of my usual lethargy and hustled out for a brisk walk. Maybe it'll have the same effect on you.

That is because I guess it is not possible to review this film honestly without breaking IMDb guidelines. So after many unsuccessful attempts, I will just be very brief and suffice it to say that this is a work with almost no redeeming features. Gina Gershon is the only believable performer so it is doubly unfair what happens to her character at the end. I literally couldn't watch the scenes of violence towards her and the other female character, an underage half-wit who adores being abused by the hurl-inducing Matthew McConaughey.

Particularly the word, ""noir"" and a few others. I've been fairly sure for some time that movie companies pad the rating on any fan site and this one is certainly no exception. Therefore do not take the rating here on IMDb, OR the positive reviews that could all have been written by the same person they are so similar. This movie has very little humor contrary to others claims. It is not suspenseful in any way. The plot is simplistic and trite. While the acting within the film is certainly up to par it's really all that can be said about this movie. The supposedly shocking scenes don't really shock you probably because 10 minutes into the film you really couldn't care less about virtually everyone in it. Every step of the way you can see the film makers patting themselves on the back with their clever little, ""shocking"" surprises. They are the only ones impressed which is why they come here to IMDb and give themselves rave reviews. Instead of watching this movie just go down to the local welfare office and watch these people. At least that way it will not cost you any money. Stay away from this film. It's boring and pointless. It's not even shocking for those of you who just like to be shocked.",Killer Joe
199,ddbverano,This dark comedy advocates domestic violence,4,2 June 2014,"This off beat film started out interesting with a white trash family planning a hit on their own Mother along with the ex-husband to get her insurance money. You have to suspend your belief throughout the film of why the MM character (Killer Joe) does what he does. The thing I found most disturbing about the film is that the Gina Gershon character gets caught cheating on her husband with the person the insurance money ends up going to. So this justifies Killer Joe beating her up and making her commit fellatio with a chicken drumstick with the husband watching. I'm all for artistic expression and free speech, but the message it will send to a lot of people is that women who betray their men deserve domestic violence. Why a established actress like Gina Gershon would play this role is a mystery to me? A lot of people were raving about the MM performance. Any actor could have done it. He plays a NC-17 version of a John Wayne. It was a one note performance.",Killer Joe
200,blythyboy,Simple plot but excellent group of characters.,7,1 July 2012,"To start with, I'm a bit of a William Friedkin fan. My all time favourite film is The Exorcist and any other film I see from him gets me slightly worried because I know he has a pretty sketchy body of work.So I saw the obvious other Friedkin choice and that was The French Connection which I thought was really good. I saw his first play adaptation, Bug, which I thought was pretty special and I started to realise how much he pushes the performances of the actors and this is clearly his priority over any other aspect of film making. Yes it has to be visually appealing but the subject matter of his work is always reliant on performances.So Killer Joe is another adaptation of a play by Tracy Letts and again has to rely on strong characters with convincing effort to make it come to life. Thankfully Killer Joe delivers on this. In fact, if it wasn't for William Friedkin's ability to add extreme pressure onto the actors by limiting the shooting to two takes per scene, I honestly think it would have lost it's attraction pretty quickly.The film takes you into the bowels of low-life Texas and really emphasizes the grim reality of life for some unfortunate families. It was surprising to discover a black comedy breeze come over the film and it did come at you pretty surprisingly (especially scenes including Thomas Haden-Church). The cinematography improved on that point by having close up shots of Joe Cooper preparing himself for his first on-screen appearance to the world and blasting mere seconds of TV trash full screen to the audience to make a clear point on red-necks having a low attention span. All of this made me chuckle but it still kept me interested by providing a simple enough plot and letting the great performances carry it along.Of course there has been a lot of talk regarding the late scenes of the film. Joe's well spoken manner and calm demeanour are pushed to the edge and his rage is unleashed like a shaken coke can that's been opened up. It came as a real shock to me and the suspense was unbearable enough to make your heart pound. Whichever way  it makes you feel at the end, I'm sure you would leave the characters behind knowing it's ended in a really good way and is sure to be discussed well after the credits.All in all, it's a good piece of work. The effort from the actors far outweigh the visuals which is perfectly fine for a story like this. I'm pretty sure Killer Joe is going to be a reasonable success at the box office and will certainly grab a lot attention when the eventual DVD release comes our way.",Killer Joe
201,dlow-20825,I wish I could give it less stars...,6,30 January 2021,"It's almost as if the movie was written to be the incarnation of the word, ""SIIIIIKE"".The character building is very good and it really draws you in, because each character is SO screwed up and their interactions are so convincing, (due to the all star cast) but then the ending is just so cheesy and predictable that it just leaves you feeling like David Blane robbed you of a dollar and you knew he was going to do it, but you feel stupid because he somehow tricked you into letting it happen anyway.It's worth a watch for sure, but it's one of those movies where after watching it, you feel like it didn't live up to it's full potential. It's hard enough to draw in an audience with a cheesy/unrealistic story, but it's even harder to get an audience to stand up and clap over a crazy unrealistic movie as well. This movie kept you interested enough no matter how corny/predictable the story line was, (due to an all-star cast) only to drop the ball at the ending.Def watch it, judge it, enjoy it for what it is, move on, probably forget it in 6 months.",Killer Joe
202,markyritchie,"Shocking and offensive...yes, entertaining...not really",5,4 October 2013,"This movie is kinda fun to review because its almost impossible to be neutral on it given the content however I'm giving it a neutral rating. Here's why:The directing and acting is superb across the board. I am NOT a traditional fan of Matthew McCoughney, but he is a really good actor, especially in darker roles like this or in 'Frailty' which I think is an underrated thriller/noir masterpiece. In fact if you want to prank someone tell the average McCoughney fan that they'll love him in films like 'Killer Joe' or 'Frailty' and most likely they'll rent them thinking its the usual rom com where he chases Kate Hudson around with his shirt off for two hours and get a RUDE awakening. The point here is that most of the films McCoughney has done are the predictable role where he is charming, witty and good looking. Here good looks and charm just mask an evil and dark individual who is pretty much perverted to his core, and he plays it almost perfectly. On top of that is Thomas Haden Church who I think kinda steals the show with some really good, oddly dark/funny lines and overall performance. Gina Gershon is also great as the trailer trash wife trying to screw everyone over. Lastly the directing is great and the overall tone of the movie is really dark and gives you that uncomfortable feeling from start to finish, which is hard to do, so in that sense it is a HUGE success.Based on everything I've said this would be a big recommendation, the problem is at the end of the day there is absolutely NOTHING positive going for anyone or anything in the film. I have no problem with dark, or even shocking content, but it should have a point. I think Friedkin has been famous for giving us moments like that like in 'The Exorcist' where the girl walks backwards down the stairs and urinates on the carpet, or masturbates with a crucifix. This was very disturbing and shocking stuff, even more so in the early 1970s, however it really did serve to tell that story better, here the blunt nudity and perverse behavior just feels like shock factor for its own sake. Having someone simulate oral sex on a chicken wing is shocking, and that's about it, creative shock factor I'll give it credit for, but not much else. On top of this is the fact that even in the end there isn't really anyone you want to root for, with exception of the Dottie character, but then she herself goes on a murderous rampage of sorts to close things out. This isn't to say that everything has to be redeemed or that there even has to be a good guy, but at least a better discernible point that the film maker is making in showing all the dark, shock, potentially offensive stuff and at the end that's where you just kinda shrug your shoulders and say, 'that was an f-ed up ending to some pretty f-ed up characters.'",Killer Joe

Or am I. Seeing Mahogany getting dressed in the police locker room putting on his leather and shades is laughable. I have never seen handcuffs look so 'manly'. Haden Church is the only one in this movie who can hold his head high. Gershon's head unfortunately has been reduced to giving a blow job to a piece of Kentucky Fried Chicken leg, held by Mahogany as he obviously 'gets off' on chicken meat sucking as he climaxes in this moment of cinematic debauchery.

209,BenceHartl,A very disturbing movie,7,14 January 2013,"Killer Joe has a very promising plot, truly great actors and professional directing, but, despite all of that, it still remains a very disturbing movie.There are many suggestive scenes, some very strange, absurd, sometimes grotesque moments, but something is missing. Playwriter Tracy Letts can't reach the high levels of Harold Pinter or Cormac McCarthy, his screenplay is just too violent and direct, and it looks like he couldn't decide whether to be real or surreal.The story has some twists and turns, but you cannot really sympathize with any of the characters, so I would look for some other message, but I couldn't find any.William Friedkin brings the raw, intensive style of his own, and it works well, he manages to keep the viewer on the edge the whole time, and the actors are brilliant too. Matthew McConaughey reminded me of the young Dennis Hopper, Thomas Haden Church is remarkable, Juno Temple is very strange and sexy, and Emile Hirsh and Gina Gershon also do a great job.Overall, the movie has some genius moments, but these moments don't add up into a masterpiece. The reason of this could be some aesthetic problems of the screenplay or some misunderstanding between writer and director. Anyway, it's worth watching!",Killer Joe
210,azitta51,"Slow, Dull. Not what I expected.",2,3 April 2013,"I was quite disappointed with this film. I'd heard it described 'film-noir', and generally love crime thrillers, and very dark comedy. I didn't love Killer Joe. The scenes felt too long with not much happening, and dialogue which frustrated me because it didn't seem to move the film forward or develop the characters much more than the first initial scenes.Yes, they are trailer trash and yes, McConaughey is a psycho-creep (which was a novelty that soon wore off for me), but are there no redeeming qualities for anyone? Not even a few different shades of creepiness and griminess? Maybe this was the whole point, but it left me feeling disinterested in the characters rather than disgusted. The nudity – I really didn't understand why she answers the door with no underwear on. This felt quite false to me, unnatural and a little bit silly. After getting to know the character a bit more, I still didn't understand the point of it. The ending - I'm all for 'slow-burners' but I didn't care enough about any of the characters, and so by the time the naff ending came about I was glad it was over. I found the whole thing quite unmemorable (although I might not look at a piece of fried chicken in the same way again).

The film is a well paced movie with an ending that if you blink you will miss it and to me that didn't make any sense and spoilt a good film.

(Tracy Letts is a man) The clarification weirdly comforted me. The story follows Chris, a young man whose demeanor immediately pegs him as a total screw up, which is reinforced by his twisted plan that shapes the plot of the film. It was not so much the thought of Chris arranging his mother's death that disturbed me about this movie, a murdered woman that shows a recent record of increased life insurance immediately puts a loved one under suspect. It is a seldom tragedy we hear on the evening news, therefore its film adaptation can only weird me out to a certain point. Killer Joe disturbed me and excited me in other ways. I loved the relationship between Joe and Dottie, Chris' little sister, a character who was absent minded and psychotically brilliant at the same time. Joe and Dottie's relationship should have felt perverted, inappropriate, and disturbing, yet it felt right; it somehow made sense of all the chaos. That is what makes this film brilliant. Killer Joe is like seeing the remains of a car crash; it is disturbing yet it stops traffic. Although the final scene became too violent for me, overall the movie is worth a watch.",Killer Joe

I've never been convinced by William Friedkin's status in the Hollywood film industry - for me The Exorcist was a fluke just like Rain Man for Barry Levinson- if it was not for the brilliant writing of William Peter Blatty The Exorcist would have ended up like Killer Joe - there were a few years where he directed some so called classics to be honest there is only one The French Connection. At 77 this must have felt really sordid to be on set with an old man who has no idea what to do with the original material and he's getting women to walk around naked, we don't have to see full frontal to know that they are naked - just let it exist as a play you should have learnt your lesson from Adapting Bug. Bug should have been the film I said farewell to Mr Friedkin but I gave him one more chance and he let me down.Now for the money shot - should have changed the ending and let us see the 12 year old girl shoot Joe in the face.

What this movie tries to do is to lure you in, thinking it's a funny (dark sure) but just a little twisted comedy, but then surprise you into something completely different. It wants to shock you and disgust you and it hopes you will be impressed by the surprising turns, the fact that it's not like any other movie. I am really interested in seeing how this movies rating will end up. Right now it has 7,5/10 with 4,177 votes. My guess is this movie will be around a 6/10 at best unless there are a lot of sick people out there who enjoy being shocked and disgusted and left feeling confused.It's a movie without a point, other then chaos and randomness. No character does what you think they will do, no character really inspires you. The story made me feel disgusted and it left me with a little less hope in mankind :)The acting was decent. Matthew McConaughey does his part well. Emile Hirsch's character is so annoying it's hard to appreciate the acting behind it. Juno Temple was very good.But all in all, why watch this movie? Why would you like it? I guess some people like to be surprised and watch something new. I think it's just stupid because the majority who watches movies are looking for a meaningful story. I like violent movies. At some point I felt this movie tries to be like a Quentin Tarantino movie, but still it's far from it. These characters are random. The atmosphere is easygoing and at times funny, but compared to a Tarantino flick the dialog is that of stupid, uninteresting people. You could argue that the point is to show how scared and not too bright people could react in a pressed situation. But is that really interesting enough to make into a film? Who would enjoy that?

There are a few powerful cinematic moments but they can't redeem Killer Joe. There is no one to care about and no reason to care.

I did like Church's consistent character, very believable. The rest no so much. There was a feel that they really wanted to be shocking in the scenes. Instead it just came across as desperate for more story. The plot twist was so shallow that a gold fish couldn't get wet. The wardrobe malfunction of the torn but pinned on suit sleeve was too over the top for a movie that was trying to be somewhat serious (shame on the wardrobe dept).

The plot is pretty predictable and the protagonists really twisted, and I mean all of them, even the young daughter, are there really people like that living among us?

227,frankylamouche,So So,1,22 January 2013,"William Friedkin makes good use of sound at the beginning of ""Killer Joe."" The introductory heraldic company titles are rendered over silence, forgoing fanfare, making the first montage of concrete audio all the more striking. Completed with a white on black, bold but neutral, Killer Joe title over twanging guitar. The movie confirms Friedkin's mastery of inside space, the single wide in ""Killer Joe""'s case. These trailers are given a bad rap due to their association with lowlifes, trash talkers and makers. The truth is most 55+ communities outside of large cities are made up of these boxes and one is prosecuted if one doesn't pick up after one's dog.A door decorated as ""DOTTIE DREAM."" A portal to a child's room, a grown up little girl, a virgin in hillbilly Sodom & Gomorrah. See the role's originator Carroll Baker as ""Baby Doll"" (http://www.imdb.com/media/rm3065156096/tt0048973).It gets real hillbilly real fast and we just go along for the ride, never expecting a family comedy which, unfortunately, turns very sour very fast. Over money of course. I saw nothing Gothic. To begin with, hillbilly ain't the south, it's pretty much the country with West Virginia its epicenter. As a modern movie, ""Killer Joe"" portrays the normal dysfunctional family. When Matthew joins the circle, pedophilia lights a fuse to disaster.A beautiful set up for the dark knight, Matt McConaughey, Killer Joe. Unfortunately, the classical ""Scorpio Rising"" approach to our first sighting of the demon is undercut by the absence of music to make it memorable. From then on the movie loses its comic crazy character and becomes cold and detached. The pit bull barks at everyone but Killer Joe.The end of the final scene followed by the song under the credit role are beyond stupid, beyond evil, in a realm indeterminate, meaningless.In summary, a so so movie with no social redeeming value. As you can tell, I'm a William Friedkin fan, so I stuck with it. A failure compared to his masterful ""To Live and Die in LA."" Matthew McConaughey gives William Petersen a run for his money, but Emile Hirsh can't hold a candle to Willem Dafoe. Wasn't he great as Max Schreck in ""Shadow of the Vampire.""A humble viewer, Franky Lamouche.",Killer Joe

So it's not just a waste of viewers time, but also of producers money. If you want violence to attract people and not make them puke, you need to show it a bid abstract, almost like a form of art!

234,skipalongcassidy,A bit hard to watch but you must watch it!,9,26 June 2012,"I liked this film a lot but be warned - some of it is a bit hard to take violence-wise. It is, however, a fascinating take on dysfunctional America and extremely funny.Matthew McConaughey is a revelation in a film full of standout performances, particularly Gina Gershon and Thomas Haden Church. People may disagree but I thought all the characters were believable and had some human, almost endearing characteristics, even Killer Joe, who in a sense played very fair according to the rules he set out to people; and clearly had a (rather twisted!) hankering for family meals and babies! This is a little tongue in cheek here obviously because God help the babies and family if they didn't live up to his controlling psychopathic expectations.The nicest character (which isn't saying much) is the wife, Sharla, she genuinely seemed to care the most about Dottie (who certainly lived up to her name but what can you expect brought up in that family?). Thomas Haden Church gave a great performance - he went from perhaps the most sympathetic character at the beginning to the least when he had absolutely no qualms about selling his daughter and finally, enthusiastically helping to kill his son.The in-your-face nudity of Sharla right at the beginning of the film seemed a tad unnecessary but I suppose it was an extremely effective way of conveying her only way of operating in the world, using her body. The well-publicised fried chicken scene was really too much for me until it became clear that Killer Joe didn't need real oral sex to get off - just complete domination and power.I must also admit that I went from total horror at the overkill of bashing someone's brains out with a tin to some amusement that it was a tin of Pumpkin Pie - it summed up the whole dysfunctional aspects of a society that one of its quintessential cultural/patriotic dishes (that you would think couldn't possibly be fitted into something the size and shape of a large can of baked beans) can come in a tin.Also, I'm a bit slow so it took me a while to realize that the slightly odd portion of blood-spattered fried chicken in the film poster is in the shape of Texas - very apt.",Killer Joe

I am a 23 year old guy who loves twisted movies, but this movie just felt forced and inauthentic. There are much better movies that deliver more profound thrills and attachment with the characters. The components of the movie seem great, it's a crime/thriller with solid actors and potential for great plot development. The pitfalls lie with the incredibly tedious pacing mixed with the subtle hints that things will get more interesting, but they sadly don't. I found myself bored multiple times and ultimately disappointed with the conclusion. I honestly feel sad for the talent wasted in this film as most of the scenes are overlong and simply uninteresting. In the end it just feels like the movie was trying way too hard to be something it wasn't. I feel like I'm talking to myself with all of these positive reviews but this is my first review ever as I normally love most movies. This is just a tedious, uninteresting character study that seems to hint towards bigger things than it delivers.**SPOILERS** You'd think a movie named Killer Joe would at least show ONE murder by him. All it showed was a woman dead in a car, and then he blows weed smoke on her ... but then he sets the car on fire. So what was the point?

237,thephage-450-310659,Finger lickin' good...,8,15 August 2012,"So often nowadays do actors become type-cast into particular roles and genres. You're going to see a Michelle Rodriguez movie? Well, you know she's not going to be wearing a dress and brandishing a sterling British accent. You're going to see a Jason Statham movie? Well, likewise, you're not going to be getting an engaging story about how one man battles adversity and discrimination to be taken seriously as a Spanish teacher in downtown Madrid. Unless by ""adversity"" and ""discrimination"" you mean ""pimps"" and ""drug runners"", and by ""Spanish teacher"" you allude to ""mean bad-ass"" That's why it's so great to see an actor break out of their shackles and surprise you, like Jonah Hill in last year's fantastic Moneyball, or Channing Tatum flexing his comedy chops in 21 Jump Street. So when someone throws the name Matthew McConaughey at you, I'd presume you'd think of the latest ""first date"" fodder film, such as How To Lose a Guy in 10 Days or The Wedding Planner, and not his fantastic turn in A Time To Kill. Well, chalk this one up with McConaughey's ""non-rom-com"" films and also rack it up as one of his best.Briefly, Killer Joe follows the exploits of a family in the backwoods of Texas as they scheme to off someone for a lucrative life insurance premium. So who do they turn to? Joe (McConaughey): the detective who moonlights as a killer-for-hire of course. As the family can only pay after the contract has been completed and the insurance claimed, Joe chooses to take a ""retainer"" just in case he doesn't get his cash, and that retainer is Dottie (a captivating Juno Temple) – the young, naive daughter of the family. What ensues, for those unfamiliar with the award-winning theatre production, is an undeniably enthralling number of twists and turns as we learn how the tale of this desperate family unfolds.What's so great about this film is the same ""just one more page"" compulsion you get with all the best novels: you're dying to know what's coming next, due in no small part to the fantastic cast and sharply delivered dialogue. McConaughey and Temple are ably backed up by Emile Hirsch as the indebted son Chris and Thomas Haden Church as the good- for-nothing father Ansel, whose world-weary one liners provide some much-needed comic relief during some of the most intense scenes of the film. And believe me when I say ""intense"". When this film chooses to get dark, it's like wandering into a cave. At night. With a blindfold on. It can make The Dark Knight Rises look about as diabolical and dark as The Smurfs. My mind immediately leaps to parallels with 2011′s fantastic Drive, which whilst fantastic, didn't shy away from some graphic beatings. However, Killer Joe also delves into sexual depravity on several occasions – something not seen in Drive, but don't let that perturb you; it's worth it. And if nothing else, I can guarantee that you'll not look at a KFC drumstick the same for a good few weeks Summary: An enthralling, yet deeply sinister story of murder in darkest Texas. The entire cast shines in what surely must be one of the must see's of the summer if you love a character-driven tale. Maybe not a film for those that are faint-of-heart or have a particular affection for the Colonel's fried chicken",Killer Joe

259,cloudconnected666-457-174496,Who would kill his mother for $6000? Without any other motive.,1,23 August 2012,"This film doesn't have anything good in it... As a video editor I can say that this is just poor directing, writing and editing. For example dialogs. They don't have sense at all. They are too long and most of the time characters jump from one thing to something completely different. Because of this I was unsure is this some kind of parody or serious film... No real flow in dialogs.Next is establishing scenes. For example, when killer shows where the body is it starts with establishing shot of restaurant. Then we see car approaching in new shot with camera panning. This second shot's last phase looks just like first shoot. That is not really good editing. Too much redundancy. Or the scene where we see how pizza is made... Nonsense! This just puts me far from story. No immersion at all.180-degree rule is broken in every scene. You are unsure who looks where... Some dialogs are edited very strange, so you are unsure why you are looking so long at someone who speaks because other persons reaction is much more important. This shows that director doesn't know anything about human psychology or emotional flows.Motivation is lacking in most of the film. No logic in characters acts. Who would kill his mother for $6000? In the beginning Ansel doesn't want to kill his ex, but all of a sudden he is really into it, and is angry at Chris. No sense at all. Chris decides to prostitute his sister, and later he says to her that he wouldn't have done it if he knew what would happen, but in that part nothing unplanned is happening: mother is dead, Dottie had sex with Joe. So no logic in his actions.End is actually the worst part. No sign of any good rhythm in film. You realize what happened, and then you watch without any interest, how Joe will tell that to Ansel and Sharla. This is not the case in just one scene. In sex scene (between Joe and Dottie) he puts away his stuff on the table - this last so long, but there is no tension, no suspense in this scene. Everything seems so fake, just as all dialogs.Do not give your money to watch this. End is hilarious...",Killer Joe
260,scotty_taylor1988,Such a great cast but such a let down,5,25 February 2013,"I honestly don't get what i just watched, the whole movie seemed pointless. I expected a lot more from this movie considering the cast it was dealt but it just failed, maybe my taste of movies isn't fit for such a dark twisted movie. Emile Hirsch and Matthew McConaughey were stand outs in the film and of course the director done a great job. but in all honesty not really my kind of movie. I won't spoil the movie for anyone but give it a watch, its a love it or hate it movie, when i first watched it i thought well that was alright but the more and more i think about it i think less of it. This is the first movie i have felt i needed to write a review about so give me some slack lol",Killer Joe
261,andyoskwarek,Outrageous Fun,8,19 November 2012,"This is a pitch black comedy noir which is outrageous and provocative throughout but also lots of fun.It's a morality tale in which every character is as conniving and complicit as the next and no one gets away clean.It's definitely not one for the easily offended but to dismiss it as nothing but trashy violence (as some posters have) is definitely wide of the mark.The performances are excellent throughout with Matthew Mcconaughey and the hugely talented Juno Temple particularly worthy of note.Some viewers may find the mixture of sex, violence and comedy a little jarring and the tone does feel a little uneven at times but for those who can find humour in the most dark and twisted of places there is plenty to enjoy here.",Killer Joe

263,topazwillow521,Worse movie of the year,1,23 December 2012,"I was completely disgusted with the themes contained within this movie. I am shocked that anyone would find it entertaining. I thought there were laws against full frontal nudity when the subject is 12 years old? I found this movie just plain sad. Not one of the characters is worth watching. I was shocked to read so many glowing reviews of this movie. There is not one redeeming element in this sad excuse of a movie. I lost a little bit of respect for Matthew McConaughey. When I saw that he was in this movie, I thought it might be worth watching. His character was a sad attempt at being an outlaw. Any movie that glorifies the exploitation of children should be banned.",Killer Joe
264,mskozazc,Absolutely WORST movie I've ever seen,1,23 December 2012,"I'm a fan of artsy smart movies that come off as ""odd"" at times but in the end provide a mind-twisting and entertaining experience... This movie does NOT fit that description. The ending is one of the DUMBEST things I've yet to see, parts of the movie were disgusting and hard to watch, the plot was terrible and 100% predictable (until the end, which remains pointless), and on top of it all the simple fight scenes (which is some of the most basic stuff) was less realistic than WWE wrestling as you could tell contact wasn't being made and yet abnormal amounts of blood would splurge everywhere.PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT purchase this movie or even rent it. They shouldn't receive a dime of profit from this garbage. It was SO terrible that I actually created an account just to write this review and hopefully save people some time and sanity. Go watch Looper, Lawless, or even Premium Rush if you're looking for a new release.",Killer Joe
265,nospamnospam123,Not Worth Watching,1,28 December 2012,"Matthew McConaughey is a very good actor, he was excellent with the role but the content was not his caliber.This is the worst movie that Matthew McConaughey has acted in, and I am surprised that he stooped so low do be part of such a low budget film.The movie was cheap and was not what I thought it would be.I kept waiting for it to get better but that failed to happen.Save your time and watch another movie that has a better story.If you want junk to entertain yourself with, this is it!I really don't understand how so many people would rate it above a 3.Cheesy and low budget.",Killer Joe
266,sawdustandcustard,More filler than Killer,4,31 December 2012,"This film was a big let down. William Friedkin is the legendary director of The French Connection and The Exorcist, but this movie is not in that league.The story revolves around a trailer park family and the return of their prodigal son, Chris. He owes money to a local drug dealer and so proposes to bump off his dysfunctional alcoholic mother and claim the insurance to settle the debt. To this end they hire crooked cop, Killer Joe.The mixture of violence and dark humour is reminiscent of the Coen brothers and there are some genuinely funny moments in the film. Overall however, Friedkin never quite manages to get the tone right. None of the characters is given enough personality or depth to be real or evoke any level of sympathy. But neither are they broad or cartoon-ish enough to be simply fun. In particular, Matthew McConaughey as the eponymous Killer Joe makes for a disappointingly vanilla psychopath. The brightest moments come from Dottie, the beautiful but not-all-there daughter, played by Juno Temple.The story meanders aimlessly as it unwinds, fails to generate any tension and to cap it all the irritating ending leaves the whole mess frustratingly unresolved.",Killer Joe
267,coconutphil,Sucked,1,9 January 2013,"This movie was simply a trailer park trash tale of greed. Really an all time low for Matthew. I really cannot believe the trash that is being out out these days. The scene where the the dudes face is being pounded with a can of pumpkin pie filling was the only decent part. The porn scene with the chicken leg was simply trash. The story really goes no where. A few folks really never have their roles in the story developed. This movie could have been good if the porn was left out and the story was better. Seemed like they were trying to do a Terentino thing, it was just awful. Stay far away from this garbage. Maybe next time.",Killer Joe
268,xxgrainne213,A movie I wish I could unsee,2,28 July 2013,"I created an IMDb account just to write a review for this movie, in fact I've never even written a movie review before at all but it felt necessary today.I watched this movie because I've loved every movie Juno Temple has starred in, specifically her movies that take place in poor southern towns like this one. This movie seemed to have potential until about half way through. At a certain point it was clear that the plot was only going to get darker and creepier and it did. I'm one of those people who have to finish a movie in completion so I kept watching. During the last half hour or so of the movie I thought I was going to throw up. The last five minutes took a dark twist and at that point I was just lost as to the characters' motives and frankly the creators of this movies' motives as well. Maybe the material was just too mature for me to understand but I was too busy trying to hold down my food to even attempt to find the meaning behind it all. I usually enjoy dark movies and movies that portray the uglies of real life but this was a whole new level. All I can say is that I cannot unsee what I just saw, but I sure would like to.",Killer Joe
269,BossEatsInebriants,Maybe I'm missing something?,4,12 November 2013,"Killer Joe is exactly as advertised: ""a totally twisted deep-fried Texas redneck trailer park murder story"". Honestly, I couldn't sum it up better if I tried and at the end of the day, I probably should have saved myself the two hours of my life and took this film at face value. I guess, the presence of McConaughey, Hirsch, and Haden Church intrigued me and while I think McConaughey did an adequate job of playing Killer Joe, a police officer/hit man for hire psychopath, I just left feeling that there were very few redeeming qualities in this film. I'm usually a big fan of Hirsch but found his character to be such a piece of sheet human being that I had trouble appreciating his acting. I mean, this sick POS hires Killer Joe to murder his own mother in order to take advantage of a $50,000 life insurance policy. The reason? Oh, she stole his drugs and now people are out to kill him. If that weren't sad enough, his father, sister, and step mom are completely on board with the whole plan. Temple's character (Hirsch's sister, Dottie) is overly off, annoying, and strangely child like and there is one scene in particular that will forever make me feel awkward when eating fried chicken (who have to see it in order to understand - but I'd recommend You-Tubing that one scene and not wasting 2 hours watching the whole film). Honestly, I'm all for dark and what some would consider ""demented"" movies but that's assuming they are done right, and Killer Joe misses the spot for me. Anyway, despite relatively high praise from critics, I found Killer Joe to be twisted and violent for the sake of being of being twisted and violent (as opposed to artistic or story-line valued purposes such as in Requiem for a Dream ) and is a pretty big swing and miss for me.-Boss Eats & Inebriants. Beer, Food, and Trouble. That's what Boss Eats & Inebriants does.",Killer Joe
270,spc1958,Probably one of the worst roles Matthew McConaughey has ever accepted.,1,23 August 2014,"This was one of those films that I kept watching because I ""just knew"" it had to get better. I watched it mainly because of McConaughey's class in most of his other roles. Oops. But he did do the remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, too. Didn't he? Ah. Disappointed again. Yes, his role as police detective/hired assassin was intriguing, but there was no expansion on the part of his being involved in law enforcement besides the piecemeal removal of his police hardware from his belt while seducing ""Dottie"". The film was also full of the usual clichés of loan sharks, collectors, thumb-breakers, and beatings of welshers. Also worn thin was the depiction of the trailer park genre (pit-bulls, broken down trailers, and unkempt, ignorant, whorish people). Wish I had spent my time more productively picking my toe-nails.",Killer Joe
271,lou-lc,Well...,2,15 November 2014,"Well maybe it's just an English-American thing. But 6.7 stars is the biggest over statement since I thought I really needed a dump. Absolute let down. I'll give it 2* for the mild semi I got when watching a bloody chick suck on a chicken drumstick. Chicks with a hairy muff like that need to shave it off, wasn't sure if something was gonna jump out, whether that be fleas or some next mans wedding ring. I get real emotional when my girl goes on a girls night out and I waste best part of 2 hours on this. If there's any other lads out there and got a chance to watch a decent crime/thriller don't watch this. Go re watch City of God or Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, not this.",Killer Joe

Matthew mcconaughey is in top form as one of the most disgusting characters i've ever seen in a movie. This is definitely not one to step easily into as it is very very disturbing but for those with a strong stomach and a taste for something adventurous and different, i highly recommend this one.",Killer Joe
