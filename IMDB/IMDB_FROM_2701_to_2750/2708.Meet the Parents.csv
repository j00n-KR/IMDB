0,bkoganbing,Those meetings are an ordeal,7,14 September 2016,"Robert DeNiro in one of his occasional forays into comedy is both funny and terrifying as the dad from hell who scares away all of his daughter Teri Polo's boyfriends and potential husbands in Meet The Parents. Those meetings are an ordeal especially when this man who was from the CIA and specializes in subtle and not so subtle interrogation techniques and has his house bugged in every which way.The latest boyfriend is Ben Stiller who has been living with Polo and now they want to make it official. The fact they're together without benefit of clergy is enough to disqualify him from the start so Polo says let's not mention it. The second is that Stiller is a male nurse and that's not quite manly enough for dad to see as a profession for a son-in-law.Observing it all and keeping mum is Mom, Blythe Danner. One wonders how she hooked up with DeNiro all those years.Stiller and DeNiro really have the comic timing down beautifully. For Stiller this is old hat for DeNiro this is a chance to show his versatility. Best scene is the whole sequence at the airport as Stiller has decided he's had enough. He learns as well all know is that there's no such thing as ex-CIA.Two sequels have been made from Meet The Parents and who knows there may be more. I hope so.",Meet the Parents
1,SnoopyStyle,Funny but Gaylord lacks strength,7,13 October 2013,"Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) is a happy male nurse who has a great girlfriend Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo). He wants to propose to her, but have to get her father Jack's (Robert De Niro) permission. Only Jack isn't the trusting kind.This starts off pretty much as expected with awkward uncomfortable interactions. The movie goes from awkward laughs to uncomfortable silences. The lie detector scene is especially funny. What makes it problematic for me is that Focker is a bit of a weasel. He's constantly trying to lie his way out of things. It's not a likable trait.I'm not talking about the cat lie. That's a defensible move. But he's too weasely even when it makes no sense. When Kevin (Owen Wilson) is getting his goat, Greg tries to puff himself up even though Jack is right there who could easily out him. It's in his nature and that's a problem.The movie has a lot of fun, and the ending is heart warming. But I have to downgrade it a little for Greg's personality. Ben Stiller plays him a little too pathetic when it would be better to have a little confidence. It's better to have him as a reasonable nice man who's dealing with a crazy Jack. He needs to be more a straight man.",Meet the Parents
2,lee_eisenberg,for anyone who's ever had to meet in-laws,9,6 June 2005,"We all know that meeting one's future in-laws can be an unpleasant experience, but none can be more unpleasant than what Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) and Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo) go through. Planning to get married, they go to meet Pam's parents Jack (Robert DeNiro) and Dina (Blythe Danner). Maybe it's the R-rated connotation inherent in Greg's surname, or maybe it's Jack's status as a CIA agent, but Greg and Jack do not hit it off. Somehow, Greg causes a series of accidents, and it all leads Jack to consider Greg unworthy for his daughter.The whole movie is pretty silly, but at the same time, all so true. One can understand that Jack wants to protect his daughter, but a lie detector test? And just what about Mr. Jinx? What is with that cat? No matter, the movie never gets so ridiculous to the point where you roll your eyes. It's nice brainless fun, but it's nice brainless fun that accurately reflects the world that we inhabit. Oh, and Greg is Jewish while Pam's family is a bunch of WASPs, so you know what that means.",Meet the Parents
3,jboothmillard,Meet the Parents,8,22 November 2008,"I have to admit I never saw this entirely before seeing the tame sequel, Meet the Fockers, and thank god I finally did, it is a fantastic comedy, from director Jay Roach (Austin Powers). Basically Jewish male nurse Gaylord 'Greg' Focker (Ben Stiller - originally it was meant to be Jim Carrey?) was planning to propose to girlfriend Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo), but he sees that first he should ask permission from Pam's parents first, like the boyfriend of her young sister Deborah 'Debbie' Byrnes (Nicole DeHuff) has. So begins the weekend visit from Hell when Greg meets mother Dina (Blythe Danner), and strict father and ex-CIA agent Jack (Robert De Niro), and trying to make a good impression, with no embarrassment or humiliation, everything that can go wrong, does go wrong, and very disastrously. In the course of the weekend trying to get on with the parents, especially Jack, Greg manages to knock over Jack's mother's ashes (and have the cat pee on them), have a personal lie detector test, hit the bride sister Debbie in the eye with a volleyball, flood the garden with the toilet water and sewage (because of the sceptic tank not being emptied), burn some of the garden and the altar made by Pam's ex-fiancée Kevin Rawley (Owen Wilson), and lose the cat Mr. Jinx. There is obviously the point where Greg pretty much gives up trying, and is told to leave, but Pam has a real talk to her father, and he knows that she is old enough to make her own decisions, and he has to get used to one of her partners, so they all make up in the end, and it ends not only with a wedding (Debbie and her boyfriend), but you know a sequel is inevitable with Jack saying ""all we have to do is meet his parents"". Also starring Jon Abrahams as Denny Byrnes and James Rebhorn as Dr. Larry Banks. Last time I saw De Niro manage some comedy was in the dark Scorcese classic, The King of Comedy, and he proves himself capable of being not only a great method actor, but a great comedian, oh, and Stiller excels too, a very funny film. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for Randy Newman's ""A Fool In Love"". Robert De Niro number 2 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was also number 50 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and he was number 5 (along with Al Pacino) on The World's Greatest Actor, and the film was number 18 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films. Very good!",Meet the Parents
4,ccthemovieman-1,De Niro The Comedian,7,24 October 2006,"Odd to state that ""Robert De Niro is the star of this comedy,"" but that's the case here. One doesn't normally associate him with comedy, but he's a pretty versatile actor, and can play a lot more characters than Mafia-type thugs. He's also a pretty darned good comedian, as he first proved way back in the early '80s with Rupert Pupkin in ""The King of Comedy.""Anyway, De Niro and Ben Stiller provide a lot of laughs in this modern-day comedy. No sense going into detail as there are plenty of other reviews here. I hate to see the ""hero"" of a movie being a character who is chronic liar (Stiller's ""Greg Focker"") but that's not unusual in the world of films. That, and Blythe Danner's excessive use of God's name as exclamations gets annoying. Other than that, it's a fun movie that turned out to be a hit and justifiably so. I imagine you could get a lot of laughs from watching this over and over. That would be better than watching the sequel.",Meet the Parents
5,dbdumonteil,parental advisory,7,17 January 2004,"This is another topic which has been extremely used in cinema: a young man who wishes to marry his girlfriend but first he's got to ask her parents the permission. And sometimes things don't go as they are expected...By making this movie, it's clear that the director Jay Roach gave the actors a free hand perhaps so as to try to compensate an unremarkable plot. The success of the movie rests on their shoulders. I would grant a special award to Ben Stiller and of course to Robert De Niro who shows that as an actor he's always at ease and excellent after all these years spent in the cinema. Of course, we're obliged to recognize that the humor isn't always subtle, certain characters are nearly stereotyped (Owen Wilson) and the sequence where De Niro blames Stiller for not being honest whereas honesty isn't his strong point appears quite conventional. As Jack Lemmon said in ""Some like it hot"" (1959): ""Nobody's perfect"". But there are quite a lot of funny situations and hilarious gags.So, a mastered topic that gives a spirited comedy.",Meet the Parents
6,Quinoa1984,Fun that any man can relate to,8,7 October 2000,"This film is off and on very funny, and overall it is a good time. Mainly due to Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller's performances as the father and the guy who wants to marry his daughter. Stiller meets the parents (De Niro and Blythe Danner) in one very chaotic weekend in Long Island where anything that can go wrong for Stiller does (a spray-painted and potty trained cat, burning down by accident the alter, overflowing the septic tank, being caught with a dragon that he likes to puff and telling a story about a cat that is a show-stopper) and enhances the comedy. A feel-good comedy, even if it may hit close to home for many a lot of men. Directed by Jay Roach (or Austin Powers and Mystery Alaska fame).",Meet the Parents
7,michaelRokeefe,Just trying to impress. The future of love is at stake.,6,14 October 2001,"This romantic comedy is scattered with laughs and hilarious situations. Greg Focker(Ben Stiller) is a male nurse and hazards to spend a weekend getting to know his girl friend's parents. Robert De Niro is the over protective father, with Blythe Danner playing the sympathetic mother of Teri Polo. Misunderstanding runs rampant in this comedy of misfit errors and bad timing. The weekend is heading south rapidly and Focker is desperate to impress his future in-laws.Also in the cast are:James Rebhorn, Phyllis George and Thomas McCarthy. The versatile De Niro hands down steals the whole show. I'm sure the many Stiller fans will disagree, but the multi talented De Niro can successfully play roles not expected of him. This is one of the best situational comedies to come along in a while; it may in fact make you feel right at home.",Meet the Parents
8,studioAT,Horrible,1,22 December 2010,"Creud,lewd and just plain unfunny. These are just three of the words I'd use to describe this film.To call it family entertainment is laughable - in fact it's probably the only laugh you'll get. Stiller and co can do better than this and yet seem quite happy to be dragged into this horrible film and its two sequels.The only people who would find this funny are immature teenagers with nothing better to do. Every joke is signposted and even then are boring.If this is what passes for entertainment then I despair. It is a very poor film.",Meet the Parents
9,sunwarrior13,Robert De Niro Proves That He Is Great At Comedy,10,20 September 2014,"This comedic film is a story of numerous unfortunate events that a good-hearted and charming but hapless nurse experiences when he visits his girlfriend's parents.Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller stars together with Teri Polo, Blythe Danner, and Owen Wilson.It was written by Jim Herzfeld and John Hamburg; and it was directed by Jay Roach.Greg Focker goes to the parents' house of his girlfriend Pam Byrnes at Long Island.Her girlfriend's sister is about to get married during their upcoming trip and Greg sees this as an opportunity to ask her and her parents' permission to marry him.As he gets introduced her parents,things go awry as Pam's father Jack has an obvious dislike for him and his occupation as a Nurse.Added to that,Jack also sees a big difference between their families as Greg happens to be grubby while Pam's family are well-mannered.It was also clear that Jack sees Greg as relatively unambitious.As the film progresses,the viewer also realizes that Jack has worked for the CIA for 34 years and implements some plans to destroy the house and the wedding in the process.Robert DeNiro gives his best comedic performance in this film.Added to that,his chemistry with Ben Stiller was so great and believable that the viewer will be instantly hooked into the film.It will definitely elicit lots of laughter from the viewer as it has a garden variety of comic relief that ranges from slapstick,offensive jokes,gags and funny lines such as ""Are you a pothead,Focker?"".In addition to that, it takes a hilarious look at the themes of family and familial relationships which the movie tackled effectively.Overall,Meet The Parents delivers like no other comedy.",Meet the Parents

11,Theo Robertson,A Major Disappointment,6,12 August 2002,"You'd think black romantic comedy + Robert De Niro + Ben Stiller = great fun wouldn't you ? But MEET THE PARENTS is an extremely disappointing film . Some of my disappointment might be down to the trailers I'd seen ( Which basically contain all the amusing moments ) which led me to believe I'd be seeing a film similar to THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY . Okay there's a couple of bad taste moments and there's a subplot involving a cat but there's nothing I found to be laugh outloud funny . De Niro - Like in WE 'RE NO ANGELS - seems to think comedy involves entirely of mugging for the camera , it's sad to point this out but De Niro is doing himself no favours by appearing in all these films , a few more unfunny comedies like this and Travis Bickle will be a distant memory . And as another reviewer pointed out watching this film after September 11th 2001 makes it even more unfunnyUpdate 2005 : Having recently rewatched this movie I wish to point out that is does slightly improve over time",Meet the Parents
12,Boba_Fett1138,A well executed comedy!,9,16 October 2004,"This movie might very well be one of the best executed comedies I've ever seen! Most of the jokes and situations are predictable but they are executed so well that it's funny nevertheless.The key element of the movie are the two male lead characters played by Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro. Robert De Niro basicaly plays 'Robert De Niro the guy who played dozens of gangster roles' which because of that makes all off his scene's fun to watch at. Just the way he looks through his eyes at times is enough to make you laugh. He perfectly knows how to make fun of his image. Owen Wilson also shows up, in a fun role.The timing in this movie is spot on. The movie is filled with jokes and good comical situations. Director Jay Roach shows that he also can handle other comedies beside the ""Austin Powers"" movies. I can't wait to see what he has made of the sequel ""Meet the Fockers"".One of the best comedies I've seen in years!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Meet the Parents
13,ferguson-6,Trailer Overload,7,21 October 2000,"Greetings again from the darkness.  This is a cute movie with some great comedy, ruined for me by the Hollywood brass that decided to spend 2 months promoting the movie by blowing every punch line and sight gag in the movie, save one (the ""drag racing"" scene).  I do think there should be a law or rule, that only allows ONE Ben Stiller movie per year.  He is good in small doses.  DeNiro is his usual scene-chewing greatness as the over-bearing dad, Gwyneth's mom (Blythe Danner) is wasted (and looks out of sync) as the too-quiet mom.  Owen Wilson has a nice turn and should consider specializing in the character actor role.  If you have not seen more than 3 previews to this movie, you should go.  I BEG you Hollywood, give us credit ... we will go see your movie if it is well written and well acted.  Don't ruin it for us before we arrive!  My special note on this one is that one of the producers is the former goofy stand-up comedian, Emo Phillips.  Also, kudos to Jay Roach for his direction.  This is a giant step from the underrated ""Blown Away"".",Meet the Parents
14,anaconda-40658,More Like Meet the Father.,6,15 December 2015,"Meet the Parents (2000): Dir: Jay Roach / Cast: Ben Stiller, Robert De Niro, Teri Polo, Blythe Danner, Owen Wilson: Comedy about every man's fear as his dating life grinds to a halt. It is about making the right impression but one of the film's problems is that it doesn't really address both parents. It regards Ben Stiller meeting Robert De Niro. Stiller plays a male nurse who proposes to Teri Polo who plays a kindergarten teacher. They plan to spend the weekend at her parents house, which is surveillance. Simple yet inviting setup predicable with numerous tasteless jokes. Interesting conclusion between De Niro and Stiller where an interesting truce is met. Directed by Jay Roach who is famous for the Austen Powers films, the original being superior to this one but obviously not the sequels. Stiller brings out the embarrassment of being viewed as a male nurse but that is the least of his problems when his future father-in-law interrogates him. We can see where this is going but De Niro counters the formula with a hilarious performance. Polo serves as a method of introduction only, and Danner is underused as De Niro's wife, which hinders the affect of the title. It certainly ties into every man's trauma when it comes time to furthering his relationship connection but perhaps if the material met with a better screenwriter then the parents might be worth meeting. Score: 6 / 10",Meet the Parents
15,Aaron1375,More realistic than its sequel this Ben Stiller/Robert DeNiro film full of laughs.,9,9 September 2010,"I enjoyed this film quite a bit as it was a nice look at what the male of the species has to go through when meeting his girlfriend's parents. This one plays a bit more realistically than does the sequel which only enhances this film a bit above that one. Greg wants to ask his girlfriend to marry him and is about to do so when he learns that she wants him to meet her parents so he prepares to meet them and get her father's approval before he asks her. What occurs is the old adage if something can go wrong it will. From making a poor first impression to accidentally uncorking a champagne bottle so that it hits the urn of someone's final resting place, one really has to feel for poor Greg. He not only has to get passed these sort of self inflicted wounds, but also must deal with the fact her dad is also an ex-CIA agent or something to that effect and poor Greg is in for a very troubling stay. Throw in the super smart cat capable of using the toilet, the only one on his side seems to be his beloved. Though the mother is not quite as bad as the father, in fact she is no where near as bad. Throw in an ex-boyfriend and a pool party that starts out very embarrassingly and turns ultra competitive and nothing is going right for poor Greg. Very funny movie and great performances all around. I liked that Owen Wilson was in it as he is always good in movies such as these. DeNiro and Stiller were very funny as well as both played their parts well. An all around good comedy, which me liking a comedy made after like 1999 is a rarity.",Meet the Parents
16,mm-39,Hilarious,8,17 October 2000,"Comedies seem to be Robert De Niro's new line of work.  He seems to do comedies very well.  (ie analyze this)  This film by far is the best comedy this year; it is sort of like the movie ""The Party"".  It's about not fitting in, and feeling left out.  Many can relate with this experience of a fish out of water situation.  This guy (Focher)is a constant accident waiting to happen.  See it... Watch it... Laugh....",Meet the Parents
17,deloudelouvain,Love it! Can watch it over and over again.,9,8 January 2016,"Haha this is one of those comedies that you will always remember. Full of classic lines that my wife and I constantly use on daily bases, like ""if it has teat then you can milk it, puff the magical dragon, the circle of trust and so on..."" Meet The Parents is full of those phrases that makes me laugh every time I think about it. And that's what defines a good comedy to me. If I watch a comedy I want to laugh and with this one it's what you get. Some people might not like it but then to me they just don't have a sense of humor and that's just a pity for them. You have to like Ben Stiller though because it's basically him that is the great comedian of the movie. If you don't like him you probably not going to like the movie either. Like I don't like the movies with Adam Sandler. I think that guy is not funny and so his comedies are painful to watch for me. In Meet The Parents the whole story is basically about the relation between Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro. Robert De Niro that plays his role brilliantly as well by the way. The other actors are good as well but it's not them that carry the movie. To me it's already a classic movie when I think about the best comedies I ever saw.",Meet the Parents
18,elo-equipamentos,"Under my roof you must hide your ""snake"" for 72 hours!!!",7,3 February 2021,"Robert De Niro was a multifaceted actor although he fits better on gangster type, he'd made several comedies as ""We are No Angels"" ""Showtime"" ""Flawless"" ""Analyze This"" and was royally convincing in all them undoubtedly by his sharp flair, this tragicomic comedy, Bob plays Jack Barnes a stubborn, protective and old fashionable father of two girls which actually think that nobody is enough good for them, all applicants shall pass by yours rules, no exceptions.When appears the Greg (Gaylord) Focker (Ben Stiller) right away Jack realizes that Greg wasn't the right choice to enter on ""Family circle"" as he used to say, afterwards the fumbling Focker whenever he touch mess up everything, even when he wanna help, breaking the sacred vase that keeps the ashes of Jack's mom, the bathroom that overflowed the putrid cesspit, the missing cat, setting fire on the wooden wedding altar, among others comic and tragic events, Jack is fed up with this freakish guy.Aside the charismatic De Niro on the role of the zealous father mesmerizing the viewers, somehow Bob scares Ben Stiller by its greatness, deflating Stiller's performance, also some dreadful dialogues spoke by Focker as reindeer cat's milk, the louder praying before the dinner brings irreparable damages on the movie that has many funny situations indeed, when the eavesdropper Jack got open the switch Greg's luggage and finds sexual props inside, what dirty mind, anyway a pleasant movie focused in the De Niro's character!!

19,StevePulaski,"A very serious, relatable story squandered",4,6 July 2015,"Is there anything more nerve-wracking or heart-racing than meeting your significant others parents for the first time? This seems to be more of an obvious fear for the male in a heterosexual relationship than it is a woman's; the desire to make a presence that's simultaneously meaningful and respectful, but not too brazen, is a tricky dance to accomplish and the anxiety that accompanies such an event is usually too much to even begin to adequately articulate. One winds up overthinking everything to the point of either saying something they didn't mean to say or feeling like they have just made a complete fool of themselves in front of the person they love and her own family.I suppose I can rest easy knowing that writers Jim Herzfeld and John Hamburg have made a ""worst case scenario"" film about the subject, which effectively makes almost any evening spent with the parents of your significant other seem desirable and successful in comparison. Jay Roach's Meet the Parents is the kind of film that takes those fears and persistent worries and etches them into a film that ups the stakes so high that, after a while, it becomes difficult to laugh given how far the film has fallen from its own sense of realism. it takes a realistic and common fear and repeatedly throws so many incredulous situations towards it, turning it into a farce, that, by the end, it's not only hard to take the film seriously, but the characters as well.We meet Gregory Focker (Ben Stiller), a male nurse who has been in a relationship with Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo) and is working to execute the perfect marriage proposal as soon as he gets off work. Just before he's about to pop the big question, Pam gets a call from her sister that she is now engaged, right after her fiancée asked Pam's father for her hand in marriage. While Pam claims it isn't necessary to do such a thing, it's a sweet, traditionalist gesture. As a result, Greg keeps his plans under the wraps and agrees to go to Pam's family's home in Long Island for the wedding.Upon losing his luggage on the flight, Greg meets Pam's father Jack (Robert De Niro) and her mother Dina (Blythe Danner). Right off the bat, Jack is cold and offputting to Greg, emphasizing Greg's less-than-positive view of cats and his own career choice of being a nurse. This sets the tone for what will be the next few days - awkward, uncomfortable interactions that will revolve around Greg trying to please Jack, but, in the end, only resulting in frustration or anger on Jack's behalf. Things only get intensified when Greg winds up meeting Kevin (Owen Wilson), Pam's ex-fiancée who is helping organize her sister's wedding.Meet the Parents has a committed cast of greats, starting with De Niro and Stiller, the two obvious, and even making strong uses of Polo and Danner, who transcend supporting roles and have a few of their own moments to shine. Consider Polo's character consistently trying to tow the lines of loyalty to her father and express her love for Greg, while Danner's character's cheeriness is usually diminished by the sternness of her husband. The glaring effects of the male characters on the female characters is an interesting dichotomy, especially seeing as the female characters are the whole reason everyone is brought together.Other than that, and some surface relatability based on the basic premise of the film rather than the actual details, Meet the Parents is one long sitcom. The film houses a barrage of overblown sight gags, caricatures instead of characters, and a case of ""maximum antics, minimum laughter,"" where the writers continue to dogpile awkward scenarios on the characters while forgetting to humanize the characters in order for the gags to actually work. This is less a film and more an assortment of asinine events that work to beat the audience down with slapstick and a great deal of comedy that is almost too desperate to be funny.Meet the Parents will get empathy points from many, but the points it receives from its obvious brand of comedy should be relatively minimal. There's an appalling lack of human interest here outside of the film's concept, which is a big problem when you have a film that has the ability to resonate very deeply with people. Many of us have been in Greg's situation and many of us have found ourselves to be the worst enemy at times, but these elements, while substantial and ripe for exploration, can even be taken in a haphazard manner.Starring: Ben Stiller, Teri Polo, Robert De Niro, Blythe Danner, and Owen Wilson.

20,Smells_Like_Cheese,Just as funny as I expected it to be,9,11 December 2003,"I am a huge Robert DeNiro fan, so I knew I just had to see this, I had heard so much about this movie and how funny it was. So I watched it the other day and I have to admit that this was so much fun to watch. I admit that it had it's predictable moments, but over all, I think the jokes worked very well and the cast was just so wonderful to watch. Robert and Ben click very well, they were so great in making the scenes just so intense, like that first dinner they have together, Ben describing how he grew up on the farm and had to milk a cat in order to save a runt kitten, was just so funny because we've all been there where we got caught up in a lie trying to figure a way out of it. The story is very funny and something everyone has to go through in their time of meeting the parents.Greg is a nurse who is about to purpose to his girlfriend, Pam, but when she tells him first of how her sister got proposed to and how her fiancée asked her father first, Greg feels obligated to ask him first before asking Pam. They go to meet her parents, Jack and Dina. Jack is a former CIA agent who is not ready to let his baby go to Greg. He's gonna make sure that this is a trip that Greg will never forget and is gonna torment him the whole way.The only problem I have is that it seems like all the good parts that my friends told me about, well, that was it. So it wasn't as surprising, but I still admit that I laughed. I loved that scene where they're playing volleyball with Pam's ex and how the team just won't give Greg a break how how he's playing and then he... well, you'll have to trust me, it gets better. Meet the Parents is a fun comedy that I'm sure will have you laughing. Robert and Ben are terrific together, I hope they do another comedy soon.9/10",Meet the Parents
21,=G=,Funny stuff with broad appeal.,7,7 March 2001,"""Stiller"", looking very much like ""Ted"" from ""There's Something About Mary"", is an ""almost fiancee"" who has gone to spend the weekend with his girlfriend's parents. There he meets the future father-in-law from hell, played by De Niro. The film is a well assembled series of comic moments, with Stiller coming out on the short end of each, which builds from the almost normal early on to the utterly preposterous near the end. The director puts a bow on the flick by tidying up loose ends with a ""feel good"" ending followed by a little kick. All in all the flick may be a small step down from ""...Mary"" for Stiller but is still quality comedy which will be enjoyed by most adults.",Meet the Parents
22,MovieAddict2016,Very funny - but the real strength of the film is being able to relate to the characters,9,11 April 2003,"Our story begins when a male nurse named Greg Focker (Stiller) is about to propose to his girlfriend, Pam (Teri Polo); unfortunately, things come to worst and before Greg can say, ""Will you marry me?"" he finds out that Pam's father, Jack (Robert De Niro) approved of Pam's sister's fiancé because he asked Jack's permission to marry her first. Taken aback, Greg decides to wait until tomorrow, whence they are going to meet Pam's parents, and ask Jack for approval before proposing to Pam. Should be a piece of cake, right? Wrong. Pam's mother (Blythe Danner) is very nice, but herein lies the problem: Not only is it apparent from the start that Pam's plant-expert father is not really a plant-expert (as Greg learns after Jack doesn't seem to recognize a plant Greg gives to him--one of the rarest plants in the world), but it turns out Jack is really in the CIA and was a ""human lie detector,"" as Pam herself puts it. In fact, Jack even gives Greg a lie detector test in one scene to see if he liked the dinner earlier in the evening. ""Yes,"" Greg replies, to see the needle jumping. ""Well, it was a little rare for my tastes, maybe."" Greg, desperately seeking approval (and nervous as ever), seems to unintentionally cause mayhem in his possible parents-to-be's home. Nerves shot like a drug addict, Greg is the definition of a nervous wreck, and all his problems seem to escalate more and more until a funny-if-sappy comedic showdown.You know how sometimes you are really nervous, but try to hide the fact? You seem to keep your cool, until you do something, then all your nervousness explodes and you start knocking over things, saying stupid things--single-handedly DOING stupid things that you just never do? And then you look around and everyone is looking at you like you are some sort of freak? Well, that's how it is with Greg's character in ""Meet the Parents""--he is so easy to identify with. Just like all of us, we want to keep our cool and impress people--but once we lose it, the coolness seems to slip farther and farther away from our grip until we are klutzes on feet. For Greg's character, small things turn bigger and bigger and bigger--from knocking over the remains of Jack's mother (and having a cat go to the bathroom on the remains), to setting the house on fire and busting the septic tank. Situations seem to escalate farther and farther out of control and they just keep getting worse and worse.In one scene, Greg tries to impress everyone while playing volleyball in a pool. His team is losing because of him. ""Get up and hit the ball,"" Jack says to him. So the next time the ball comes around to Greg, he jumps up and smacks the ball with all his might, sending it flying towards...Pam's sister (whose wedding is the next day), shattering her nose. Greg lands back in the pool and seems to be happy, until he realizes he smacked his sister-in-law-to-be in the nose. Then everyone looks at him like he's an insensitive idiot.Things like that have happened to me countless times, and that is why I can so easily identify with Greg. People are yelling at Greg to do something, and when he finally does it, it backfires and everyone looks at him like he's stupid, even though he did exactly what he was told.That's the kind of thing that makes this movie so great--not only is it extremely funny, but we can easily identify with the main character countless times throughout the film.

24,sddavis63,Deniro And Stiller Worked Well Together,7,22 December 2011,"What made this movie work so well was the combination of Robert Deniro and Ben Stiller. Both very good actors, put together they did a wonderful job of making this a very funny movie, largely by playing their roles so seriously. Stiller's character of Greg Focker was one any man can relate to - if you've ever been in the position of having to meet your girlfriend's father for the first time. In this case, the pressure was really on. Greg wants to marry Pam (Teri Polo) but finds out that her father would expect to give his permission before he even asks. So he accompanies Pam home for her sister's wedding, and discovers that Jack (Deniro) isn't your average, everyday potential father in law. Instead, he turns out to be an ex CIA agent who's extremely protective of his daughters and has more than a few quirks of his own - not the least of which is an obsession with his cat, Mr. Jinks. Desperately trying to impress Jack (or at least trying not to get on his bad side) Greg ends up unintentionally causing chaos in the home. He breaks the urn holding Jack's mother's ashes; he lets Mr. Jinks outside and loses him; he accidentally breaks Pam's sister's nose while playing volleyball; he sets fire to the backyard; he causes the septic tank to overflow. If that sounds like it might be going a bit overboard, it really doesn't go overboard. It never falls into mere slapstick humour. Greg's misadventures all seem very natural and believable. It's simply that nothing goes right on this weekend with his potential in-laws, and the end result is that Jack becomes convinced that this guy isn't good enough for his beloved first born daughter - a feeling compounded by the fact that her sister is marrying a doctor who's also the son of a doctor, while Greg is a nurse. Deniro and Stiller played off each other perfectly and produced a number of very funny scenes together.The movie was weakened a bit, in my opinion, by supporting performances that weren't as strong. Polo was very much in the background. She was likable enough, but added really very little to the movie (except that her character was necessary to push forward the tension between Jack and Greg.) Blythe Danner was underused as Pam's mother, and I found Owen Wilson's character of Kevin (Pam's ex-fiancé) to be irritating more than anything, and maybe a little too much for the story.Overall, though, this is an enjoyable movie; one of the better comedies of recent years.

26,ElMaruecan82,The 's' at the end of the title is useless ...,8,13 January 2014,"Just when I thought that ""fat, drunk and stupid"" wasn't the way to ""go through life"", cinema provided me the perfect example of a man doomed for failure. His name? Gaylord Focker. His profession? Male nurse. How does he look? Slightly below average, but a Tom Cruise, he ain't, if you except some pretty blue eyes no really, he looks like that poor schmuck who thought he had a chance with Cameron Diaz in ""There's Something About Mary""  see? What else from that glorious portrait? Well, he's in love with Pam (Teri Polo), a pretty blonde from a Conservative WASP family, and being Jewish wouldn't help either. Except that she loves him, she would probably say 'yes' if he manages to propose her, granted Pam's sister doesn't steal her thunder and the ring doesn't get lost with the luggage in the airport  yes, I forgot to mention Greg (that's how they call him) is also unlucky but that was quite easy to find out. Anyway, Pam loves him and her sister's wedding seems like the perfect opportunity to introduce Greg. Except that opportunity doesn't rhyme with formality, there has to be a catch otherwise, the film wouldn't be one of the funniest of the 2000's.The catch is a hard-nosed man in his early sixties, who loves his wife Dina (Blythe Danner), his two daughters and Jinx, his Siamese cat. He's over-protective and over-suspicious, he's a Conservative Christian, and much more than this, he's an ex-CIA Agent. His name is Jack Byrnes and he's played by Bobby De Niro, who else could? ""Meet the Parents"" all relies on the antagonism between Greg and Jack and it follows a simple yet effective pattern: whatever Greg does, he'll be ridiculous. No matter how hard he'll try to make himself within the family circle, Jack's beloved concept, he'll end up displeasing him. It feels like a one-note approach to the subject, but for some miraculous reason, it never feels redundant and here's why.The credit goes to Jay Roach, the director, each scene prepares us to a funny pay-off. Secondly, there's not one single 'funny' character, they're all, within their own state of mind, normal and well-meaning persons. One might argue that a CIA agent who trained his cat to use the toilet might be a little twisted, or a name like Gaylord Focker is too funny not to belong to a goof-ball, but fact is, there's no clown in the film, the two opposite leads are straight men with clearly defined personalities. The average schmuck who wants to propose the blonde daughter and must get the approval of the father, and the conservative father who believes his baby girl deserves the best.The comedic situations result in all the interactions between Greg and Jack, and their one-sided attempts to get along. There is a family dinner scene that crystallizes whatever is funny in the film, Greg tries to make a joke, he ends up insulting Greg's mother, he start talking about a random subject such as 'milking' cat, making the gesture as if we didn't get it, and arguing that you can milk anything with nipples to which Jack's ""I have nipples, Greg. Could you milk me?"" is the perfect comeback and the film's most memorable line. There's also a jar containing Jack's mother ashes which makes us expect the worst but the point is to laugh, not at Greg, but at his desperate attempts to accommodate with his soon-to-be family-in-law. The film is never mean-spirited, well, maybe a little but, but we never laugh in a mean-spirited way I think soI believe one of the reasons the film succeeds is because the recurring theme is being an outsider, which is a situation most viewers can relate to. And meeting the parents of your beloved one is probably one of the nightmares everyone must get through once in the life, the issue is undermined by Greg's differences, which are never mocked, he's proud of his job, which is all to his honor. He's Jewish but accepts to say the blessing, although it doesn't really turn out as we'd expect. The point is that there are more cultural gaps in America than anyone would believe, and at a time, where 'mixed' marriages are so common, it's also something many can relate to. And God, what can be worst than a lie detector test from your father in law? The film introduces Pam's sister and her future husband, a doctor (a real one, from Jack's perspective), the ideal man for his daughter, there's also Owen Wilson as a priest and carpenter who lived a passionate romance with Pam, 'only physical' (was that supposed to comfort him?) and Jack's son who'd be responsible for a minor drugs' subplot, not the best part of the film. Indeed, it loses its pacing at some point where Greg becomes the public enemy number one, Greg, but then it takes us to a hilarious airplane climax where Greg finally goes berserk and vent his anger out on flight attendants and a last and final confrontation with Jack.Ben Stiller has already proved his value as a character –actor for poor and well-meaning schmucks, he reprises his role from ""There's Something About Mary"" but gives it an even deeper feeling. De Niro has no comparable talent to make fun of his own intimidating presence and knows how to parody his own gangster mimics for grabbing a few laughs. He was rightfully nominated for the Golden Globe. Blythe Danner also provides a sweet touch as the understanding mother who asks Jack to ""go easy on Greg"", but fate is that no matter what can go wrong, it all go wrong. Murphy's law indeed.And if one thing, the film proves right the idea that marrying someone, no matter what we want, is also marrying the family.",Meet the Parents
27,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Well? Could you?,7,9 August 2020,"The moment in which 'Meet The Parents (2000)' solidifies itself as an exemplary entry in the genre is the very same in which De Niro's tight-lipped, ex-CIA retiree asks his soon-to-be son-in-law a simple, innocuous question: ""I have nipples, Greg. Could you milk me?"". As soon as the question leaves his lips, it's clear that the movie is completely in control of its eponymous premise. Via a series of awkward interactions, haphazard misunderstandings and just a smidge of slapstick tomfoolery, the piece definitely delivers the goods when it comes to comedy. It's a fun, funny and often frustrating experience that does, essentially, exactly what it needs to. It's good-natured, remaining fairly 'feel good' even when it's putting its likeable protagonist through the wringer. Its cast is compelling and its writing is quite sharp; it's ultimately an enjoyable experience throughout. It isn't especially deep - although it hits its emotional pay-offs rather well and has a fairly major character arc - but it doesn't really need to be. It's a good time. 7/10",Meet the Parents

Ben Stiller plays a really nice guy, really normal nice guy who is about to meet the family of his fiancée (played by Teri Polo). And this family is plain old weird, especially with Robert Deniro playing an ex-CIA dad with a lot of house rules.You might not have heard of the Fockers movies (""Meet he Fockers"") but this is the first of them, and the best (even though it's fun to seen Dustin Hoffman show up in the second one). Already this is star-studded. Next to Deniro is Blythe Danner as the mom, and eventually Owen Wilson shows up.What do you get? A romantic comedy which ends up being a series of set up gags and one-liners. It's funny, maybe even hilarious if you're in the mood. And it is what it is, pure silly entertainment. It worked for me only so far. I think I was at first surprised at how subtle Stiller's acting was. But eventually it becomes one absurdity after another.Which is the nature of these kinds of comedies. If you like the cast, go for it!",Meet the Parents
31,ironhorse_iv,This comedy doesn't fock around. It really does meets the requirement on being funny! I'm satisfied with the results.,7,9 November 2017,"Meeting the parents of your partner for the first time will always be nerve wracking. The pressures of making a great first impression can make any man or woman, feel awkward and nervous. For some of them, meeting the parents can turn out to be, a total disaster. Directed by Jay Roach, the film chronicles a series of excruciating moments that befall, one such man; Greg Focker (Ben Stiller), when meeting his girlfriend, Pam Byrnes's (Teri Polo) parents; overbearing father, Jack (Robert De Niro) & kind-hearted, mother Dina (Blythe Danner). Without spoiling the movie, too much, I thought the series of unfortunate events & misunderstands were very funny at the time and still, is, even if some of the jokes hasn't aged well; such with the common misconceptions and stereotypes about gender roles & sexual orientations. While, the jokes about Greg's unlucky last name were very fresh at the time for a PG-13 movie, I think, rewatching this movie, along with the films badly delivered, sequels; 2004's 'Meet the Fockers' & 2010's 'Little Fockers' have, really run that joke to the ground. It's just not as risky or funny as it used to be. Nevertheless, most of the humor is still, timeless. The whole scene of Greg, explaining, how you can milk anything with nipples, will forever, crack me up! Ben Stiller really does delivered as the good-hearted but hapless goofball of a boyfriend, without going, way, over the top with his reaction and ad lib abilities. I also love, how the movie doesn't play, too much of the slapstick physical comedy that Stiller was known for, at the time. Don't get me wrong, I love 1998's 'There's something about Mary', but I do like, how the film, for the most part, keeps the humor, realistic in tone. It makes for more, well-rounded, appealing movie, because how relatable, some of the actions scenes, were. As for Robert De Niro, it's probably, his best comedic role, ever. Even better than his role in 1999's mob comedy, 'Analyze This'. Although, playing Jack Byrnes isn't much of challenge for Niro, since there was barely any different between that movie character from the normal, dramatic commanding tough guy roles, De Niro is known for. I have to say, the role did help him, bounce back from the awfully of 2000's the live-action/animated film, 'The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle', which nearly put a halt to De Niro's comedy acting career. It really does show the public, that the man can indeed make people, laugh. One thing, I thought, the movie could had improve, upon, is giving Blythe Danner's character, more to do. Don't get me wrong, her performance was mostly fine, but Danner's talent really does seem a bit wasted, in this forgettable role. I was really, hoping for Dina, to be, just as hard on Greg as Jack is. After all, the movie is call, 'Meet the Parents', not 'Meet the Father'. Nevertheless, deep down me, I really did like the comedic performance of everybody involve with this project, ranging from James Rebhorn as Dr. Bob, Owen Wilson playing Pam's ex-fiancée, Kevin Rawley to the two five-year-old Himalayan cats that both played Mr. Jinx. I just wish, the female characters, had more to do, than stand them, looking disgust or embarrassed at Greg's actions. Regardless of that, the movie has more to give, than jokes. The movie was very well-shot. There is no better, example of fine-filmmaking than the roof scene. The way, Roach & his crew was able to show, multiply times, happening, at once is amazing. Another great thing, about this movie is the music, compose by music artist, Randy Newman. All of them, are easy-listening & worth checking out on their own. After all, Newman's original song ""A Fool in Love"" was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song. So it's worth a listen or two. Overall: I have to say, this is one of those remakes that really outshine the original movie. It makes 1992's independent film of the same name look unfunny, cheap, and amateurism. 2001's 'Meet the Parent' is a fairly good film to sit down and watch with the whole family. That's no lie.

The filmmakers take advantage of the phenomenal tension between Greg and Jack, and place them in one hilarious situation after another. The more Stiller gets in trouble, the more painful it gets, the better Stiller gets, the more the audience laugh. There is also a part from Owen Wilson.

36,Anonymous_Maxine,Ben Stiller in a good movie?! There's a first time for everything.,9,2 April 2001,"Meet The Parents is an excellent comedy, despite the fact that the casting director was not the most brilliant person in the world. A lot of the material in the film was clichéd or simply not creative, such as the fact that Greg's (Stiller) luggage obviously got lost, but the film as a whole is an excellent and very entertaining comedy. Robert DeNiro is horribly miscast as the overprotective father, but he is such a good actor that he makes his performance in the role work very effectively. He didn't get to really be the startlingly effective tough guy that he is so famous for, but at least he was introduced in a domineering low angle shot, as he looks down at Greg and Pam from his bedroom window (a very smart move by the film's director).
Ben Stiller plays the part of the charmingly named Greg Focker, who wants to marry his girlfriend but has to earn the approval of her parents first. His name is bad enough, but he has to constantly explain his job as a nurse, a profession which provides him little to no respect from Pam's family. The majority of the film relates the events of the weekend spent at Pam's parents house, and everything imaginable goes wrong for him. The thing that makes this movie so funny is the well-written script and the way that some of the actors deliver their lines, particularly Robert DeNiro. The casting director deserves little to no credit for DeNiro's quality performance, but he just did such a good job in an uncharacteristic performance that he really steals the show. Some of the situations and especially the dialogue in this movie are destined to become classic lines  `Not many men in your profession, are there, Greg?' `I have nipples, could you milk me?' And, of course, there is the hilarious way that DeNiro constantly calls Greg `Focker' or, in at least one instance, `Greg R.N.' Meet The Parents is a film that a surprisingly wide variety of people can enjoy. Meeting the parents is a part of relationships that the vast majority of men go through, and this can either be a smooth or devastating experience, so they can relate to what goes on in this film. Also, the point of view of the woman whose parents are being met is thoroughly presented, so the female audience will not feel left out at all. Even parents can enjoy this movie, because what parents don't worry about their kids and their dating experiences? Some of the situations may go a little too far, I mean, it's not very often that an eligible bachelor meets his girlfriend's parents and nearly burns their house to the ground, and it's a little excessive that EVERYthing goes wrong, not just a lot of things, but the comedy is so good that these excessive things are okay.Ben Stiller is actually a good choice to play the role of Greg Focker, because he is such an annoying actor that it is very effective in the way that he gets all of Pam's family and friends to hate him. He makes a good scapegoat, and his unfortunate luck produces a good portion of the comedy in this film. But it is DeNiro, above all, who makes this such a good movie. He is cast strongly against type, but Meet The Parents is still a very well-made comedy that is just a lot of fun.",Meet the Parents

Just great!",9,5 October 2018,"What is so great about the very first ""Meet the Parents"" edition, is the simple fact that the characters act credibly. However funny the scenes and misunderstandings can get, the seriousness with which everyone acts, adds to the credibility of the characters. I need to be able to believe in the characters, before I can laugh about the shameful and hilarious situations they get themselves into. This credibility is missing in the 2 sequels. Robert de Niro is the best in serious acting. The man becomes funny because he is FEARED. I constantly got the feeling that he could smash someones skull in with a baseball bat. There is always that looming maniac inside de Niro's characters. Combine that with the dorky goofiness of Ben Stiller and we've got a comedy match made in heaven.Need I tell the story?

In spite of all the hype and advertising, I just didn't think the film was funny. I mean when the running joke of the movie is the hero's surname (Focker) you know the producers are going to be hard up for laughs. And yes, we are again exposed to yet another ""typical American family"" living in an upscale neighborhood with riches and privileges only few outside the movie colony can afford.Ben Stiller as the hero does the best that he can with limited material. Robert DeNiro as the prospective father-in-law is again parodying his tough guy image, but it doesn't come off this time as well as it did in ""Analyze This"" (1999). DeNiro's performance, I thought, was a bit over the top, and was for the first time a performance of his that I didn't thoroughly enjoy. The performance of Teri Polo as Stiller's love interest didn't impress me. Blythe Danner is wasted as DeNiro's scatterbrained wife. Owen Wilson's character is a bit of a mystery. How are we to believe that a hugely successful businessman such as he seems to be, can't even get a date for dinner ""at the Club"". My god, even ex-beauty queen Phyllis George is in the cast, but if you blink you'll miss her.I was not impressed with the be-belittling of the nursing profession or the continuous insults heaped upon the Stiller character.

43,barnabyrudge,Solid comedy in which the comic timing of De Niro and Stiller masks the predictable plot and gags.,6,3 September 2006,"Meet The Parents is a predictable but fairly funny story about a guy whose attempts to impress his potential future in-laws go disastrously wrong. There's a lot of talk on the IMDb about it being the funniest comedy ever and the best film of its decade to date, but in all honesty such talk is rather naïve. Instead, Meet The Parents comes across as a solid, enjoyable comedy of errors. Anyone who watches a lot of comedies will see some of the punch-lines a mile off, but the performers demonstrate a nice sense of comic timing that raises a smile from even the more obvious gags.Male nurse Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) plans to propose marriage to his steady girlfriend Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo). However, she mentions during a conversation that her father is a very traditionally-minded man who believes that potential ""suitors"" should ask his permission before proposing to his daughters. Greg decides to accompany Pam on a weekend visit to her parents' place, hoping to make a good impression in their eyes before asking for their approval in his plans. Pam's father Jack (Robert De Niro) turns out to be a pretty intimidating guy, and things only get more and more awkward for Greg when he learns that his future father-in-law is an ex-CIA interrogator. Trying too hard to make a good impression, Greg almost always invariably does just the opposite. an attempt to shower everyone with champagne results in a vase containing Jack's mum's ashes getting smashed; a game of water volleyball ends with Jack's other daughter getting her face wounded; an innocent cigarette causes some pretty disastrous fire damage to the Byrnes' house; etc, etc. Ultimately, Greg causes so much unintentional havoc that he virtually shatters his chances of being accepted by the Byrnes.The film is actually based on a rarely seen low-budget 1992 film of the same title. Here it gets a more polished makeover, though is not necessarily the better of the two films. Stiller is likable in his accident-prone role while De Niro shows a nice flair for comedy as the terrifying father. Polo doesn't have a great deal to do as the girlfriend, since her role mostly consists of hugging the insecure Greg and assuring him that he's doing great, and Blythe Danner is similarly under-used as De Niro's sweet-natured wife. Of the lead actors, the other one who has the best of things is Owen Wilson, in a small but amusing part as Pam's ex boyfriend. In essence this is a situation comedy of the kind seen on TV virtually every day, but scaled-up with A-list stars and an expensive, cinematic sheen. The script contains some funny one-liners which the actors seize upon with plenty of verve, and Jay Roach directs it with the pace and confidence he invested in his Austin Powers movies. Meet The Parents is plenty of fun, especially when treated on its merits, but you shouldn't be hoodwinked into expecting the comedy-to-end-all-comedies. If that's what you expect and demand of the film, you may come away feeling a little let down.",Meet the Parents
44,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,Excellent comedy starring Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller!,10,17 November 2005,"MEET THE PARENTS, in my opinion, is an excellent comedy starring Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller. You go, guys! My favorite parts were when Greg (Ben Stiller) accidentally hit Debbie (Nicole DeHuff) in the eye and nose with a volleyball, verbally abused the flight attendant (Kali Rocha), which resulted in an interrogation from Norm (Bernie Sheredy), and whenever he goofed off. I also laughed when Jack (Robert De Niro), and when he imitated a bugle trumpeting a fanfare right before saying, ""People, people, people, come get your revised itineraries."" I thought that he was really psychotic. This was because he couldn't seem to stop messing things up for Greg. Plus, he expected his daughters' (Nicole DeHuff and Teri Polo) boyfriends (Thomas McCarthy and Ben Stiller) to meet him and Dina (Blythe Danner) and then ask his permission before proposing to them. Also, I thought that Pam (Teri Polo) looked very beautiful in all the fancy clothing that she wore, especially the maid of honor dress she wore at Bob (Thomas McCarthy) and Debbie's wedding. I especially liked Jack's tuxedo, especially with the top hat. If you ask me, that gave it a nice touch. The ending, however, made no sense to me. It's hard for me to explain why. In conclusion, I highly recommend this smash hit to all you Robert De Niro or Ben Stiller fans out there who have not seen it. You're in for a real treat and a lot of laughs, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.",Meet the Parents
45,rooprect,If you hate cats Robert De Niro will kick your butt,7,5 January 2014,"I know I'm late to the party, but probably so are you if you're reading reviews at this late date. ""Meet the Parents"" is a funny flick that hearkens back to the glorious late-80s, or maybe even earlier, when comedies weren't so preoccupied with shocking the audience with gross out gags or surprise twists. Most of this movie is wonderfully predictable, and aside from a few deliberately clumsy drug references and maybe a sexual innuendo or two, it was good clean fun from start to finish.Most of all, I'd say it's a good date flick to prepare yourself for the inevitable agony of meeting your own boyfriend/girlfriend's parents. We all know it sucks. (If you don't think so, oh, just you wait. Sometimes it takes years for them to expose themselves as the hideous flesh eating monsters that they are.) De Niro manages to take us to the utter extreme of monster but without shattering our suspension of disbelief. This is a key point. If the situation were to become too absurd , we would lose focus on the story and instead hone in on the individual gags. While there are plenty of funny gags to go round, they are really just dressing on an already funny premise: the story of an underdog who just cannot fit in to a judgmental bourgeois family no matter how hard (and usually because of how hard) he tries.Ben Stiller shows his acting diversity (while on a different movie set playing the terminally airheaded Zoolander) as a dorky protagonist whose best intentions are always poorly timed or received completely the wrong way.The antagonists, in this case, everybody else in the movie, tread the fine line of comedy and irritation. That is, at any time you could find yourself laughing or hating them. What's masterfully done is the filmmaker's (and of course actors') ability to turn you on a dime, take you to the edge of wanting to kill someone but then having a hearty laugh at their antics. Like I said earlier, Robert De Niro is the anchor that makes this possible, and any casting short of him (well, or maybe Christopher Walken) would have resulted in the film falling apart due to the demands it puts on our willingness to accept a complete jerk like the character he plays. Really his only redeeming quality is that he likes cats. But that's the point, I guess. No matter how rude a person may seem, there's always something redeeming in there.Well, maybe except for the hilariously loathsome airline attendant who appears in a short but pivotal role at the film's climax. To me, that scene was worth the price of admission.Don't think twice, this is a movie worth seeing. Other similar films focusing on severely dysfunctional families trying to act normally include De Niro & Billy Crystal in ""Analyze This"", a great Andy Garcia movie called ""City Island"" and--this may be a stretch but--I think fans of ""Meet the Parents"" would really enjoy the original British ""Death at a Funeral"" (2007). Ya just gotta love comedies about trying to be normal in an utterly abnormal situation.",Meet the Parents
46,TOMNEL,A less wacky side of Ben Stiller is also funny.,9,26 July 2005,"Ben Stiller, Robert DeNiro, Teri Polo, Blythe Danner, Owen Wilson, Nicole Dehuff and Jon Abrahams.This has to be Ben Stiller's funniest film, even though it's a less wacky movie than most of his. Anyway, Gaylord ""Greg"" Focker(Stiller) is a nurse that wants to propose to his girlfriend Pam Byrnes(Polo) but first must meet her parents. When he gets there, her father Jack(DeNiro) obviously doesn't like him, which is basically the entire movie. Blythe Danner plays DeNiro's wife and is normal acting, but very good in her role. After Greg already makes Pam's family hate him, her ex-boyfriend Kevin Rawley(Wilson) comes over and tells intimate secrets to Greg. Nicole Dehuff plays Pam's newlywed sister and in real life died recently of pneumonia(she was in her early 30's).my rating-A-94%. rated PG-13 for sexual humor, drug content and language. 111 minutes.",Meet the Parents
47,rbverhoef,Painfully funny,7,30 May 2004,"Most of the funny moments in 'Meet the Parents' involve painful scenes with Ben Stiller. He plays Greg Focker, a male nurse who loves Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo). He wants to marry her with her father's permission. He hasn't met her parents yet. The movie shows us the weekend where Stiller meets the parents. Pam's father is Jack (Robert De Niro) and her mother is Dina (Blythe Danner). The more Greg tries to impress the parents, especially Jack who is a former CIA-agent, the more he humiliates himself. Not only with his actions, also with his words and stupid lies to look better.Stiller is perfect in this kind of role. We already saw that, especially in 'There's Something About Mary'. The more he gets in trouble, the more painful it gets, the better Stiller gets and the more we laugh. There is also a fine little part from Owen Wilson as Pam's former lover. Stiller and Wilson have made a lot of films together and for some reason their scenes always work, they at least make you smile. De Niro doesn't try very hard to be a strict person who doesn't give Greg a chance and therefore succeeds even better. The way he slowly gets harder and harder on Greg is good for a new laugh every time. 'Meet the Parents', directed by Jay Roach who also directed the 'Austin Powers' trilogy, is a fine comedy with a lot of sequences where you might feel a little uncomfortable.",Meet the Parents
48,triple8,Not as funny as expected but still OK-but just OK.,6,15 December 2003,"When I(finally) saw ""Meet the Parents"" which I had heard SO much about I was expecting a lot. Maybe my expectations were to high, it definitely wasn't the laugh fest I had expected though I still kind of enjoyed it and would rate it about a 6 or so out of 10. I wouldn't really strongly recommend it though.Some of the jokes, to me, just weren't funny. Like for instance the volleyball that hits the girl in the face and the ern breaking with the ashes in it. I also thought some of the jokes directed to Greg(Stiller's character) were a bit cruel. I thought I was the only one who thought that until I read some of the other reviews on here and found that others agreed with me. Some of the jokes were funny-there were a few great one liners and fun dialog(the ""martha farker"" thing, the ""milking"" scene for instance)but after awhile I was just getting mad at everyone for tormenting this guy and angry at his girlfriend Pam for not sticking up for him. The movie to me rated somewhere between a 5.5 and 6 which still means I thought it was average , just not great or the ""10"" I thought it would be.De Nero easily steals the movie in his best role and should consider more roles in comedy, somehow he manages to keep Jack Likable through it all(even while I started hating everyone else picking on poor Greg I couldn't hate Jack)and he absolutely makes the movie, with another actor I probably wouldn't have liked it at all.The best scene in the movie was when Jack ""proposed"" to Greg, THAT was great. Meet the parents was definitely not perfect but OK to see as a rental if not already seen. My vote's 5 or 6 out of 10.",Meet the Parents
49,RatedVforVinny,A very amusing take on the in laws from hell.,7,30 May 2020,"This comedy works pretty well indeed and Robert De Niro can surely act comedy in a an effortless and seamless way. The situations are all clever and well thought through. Though some of the characterization is overdone, it does not detract (too much) from the well executed jokes. In laws from hell? Rather the baddest Outlaws, as a pure nightmare. An enjoyable ride for sure.",Meet the Parents
50,raulfaust,Great,9,21 October 2013,"Well, ""Meet The Parents"" is a known movie and now I can say why. It is a very American kind of comedy that makes you laugh and identify yourself with the protagonist, no matter if you are a man or a woman. Greg tries everything to fit in the family, but things don't go the way he wishes, given that his father-in-law is an inconvenient person. There are lots of funny scenes built with intelligence, such as the airport one, which shows how bureaucratic these companies usually are. Writers portrayed Robert De Niros' character as an eventual nice guys, which makes us don't hate him, otherwise we wouldn't enjoy the movie as a whole as we all do. All the cast is extremely professional, with big congratulations for Ben Stiller for being so spontaneous. In the end, despite all the good and funny scenes, we still have some beautiful messages about family and love. Great movie!!!",Meet the Parents

52,philip_vanderveken,I just loved this movie and I'm normally not a Ben Stiller fan,8,6 April 2005,"I know it's a bit weird, but I saw ""Meet the Fockers"" before I saw this movie. The reason for that is because I hadn't had the chance yet to see this one, when I went with some friends to the cinema and they all wanted to see the sequel. They all loved the first one, so I didn't mind giving ""Meet the Fockers"" a try. And all I can say about it is that I was rather disappointed by it. The only thing that made me believe this one was better, was because my friends didn't like the sequel all that much either.In this movie we see Gaylord 'Greg' Focker (Ben Stiller) who wants to ask his girlfriend (Teri Polo) to marry him. But first he'll have to meet her parents, because her strict father (Robert DeNiro) expects to be asked for his daughter's hand before she can accept. Normally meeting the parents of your fiancée shouldn't be too bad, but Jack Byrnes is a former CIA agent who never has liked any of his daughter's boyfriends and Greg Focker won't be an exception to that rule. He makes Greg's life miserable, while Murphy's Law does the rest by turning Greg into a master of disaster...I have to admit that I didn't have too high expectation about this movie after seeing the sequel, but now I know one thing for sure: they should have stopped with the first one, because this is an excellent comedy. I was laughing all the time and really liked it enormously. Even though I'm not a big Ben Stiller fan (I hated ""Zoolander"" and wasn't all too keen on ""Duplex"" and ""Meet the Fockers""), I must say that he did a great job in this movie. Together with Robert De Niro he's the main reason why you should watch this movie. I give it at least a 7.5/10",Meet the Parents

He soon finds out that her father is very strict and that he is very protective of his daughter and wants what is the best for her.This film is sweet and funny. Some of the jokes could be laugh out loud and some could be overrated. Greg does many things to hide all of the bad things he's done like make Jinxy, the family's cat, to run away and lit the alter, for Pam's sister's wedding, on fire.

Her father (Robert De Niro) isn't quite what Greg has been led to believe, and right from the start he seems to have it in for his daughter's partner.De Niro and Stiller play off each other brilliantly, and both of them give fine comic performances, with a surprising level of depth for comedy characters.

56,blumdeluxe,Easy Humor,5,1 October 2017,"""Meet the parents"" deals with a young man who is supposed to meet the family of his girlfriend for the first time. As he arrives at the house of the seemingly wealthy elderly couple, a chain reaction of bad luck begins that lets him stand in very poor light before his girlfriend's family.This is a classic example of a Hollywood comedy aiming at larger audiences. The humor it works with is a very easy one, mostly slapstick, and takes up such a large amount of the film that it can be considered the dominating element. Some of the jokes work, some are rather dull, it's surely not fine humor. There are some logical errors but I guess those are not all too important in a movie like this one. I think that the film will work for many people, it is professionally produced and stars a lot of well known actors.All in all this is a solid comedy that doesn't deliver anything unexpected to make it a more special film. It is entertaining and doesn't get boring throughout all of its play-time, but your expectations shouldn't be too high.",Meet the Parents
57,Sirus_the_Virus,Hilarious.,10,5 September 2009,"I loved both Meet the Parents films. I don't know which one I liked more because they were both hilarious. Both Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller are fantastic in these films. Director Jay Roach has brought us his best films to date. Some people find Austin Powers stupid. I think it's really funny, but I prefer Meet the Parents more. Robert De Niro's Jack Byrnes' character reminds me of my father. I mean my dad wasn't in the C.I.A or anything like that but he sure does scare some people. De Niro's character in Meet the parents is kind of an asshole because he goes out of his way to make Greg(Ben Stiller) look bad. It feels that way at least. I think that, though Austin Powers was hilarious, Meet the parents is a comedy that everyone can enjoy. It is the definitely better version of Son in Law. I wasn't a fan of Son in Law, but I love this film. The acting is a lot better and the film is a lot funnier than Son in Law. Not that I have a problem with Pauly Shore, it's just that I prefer Ben Stiller. I am one of those people. Well, I doubt that Ben Stiller will go and fake his death like Pauly Shore did. Well, it was just a film, but Pauly Shore really hasn't done anything in so long. Both Meet he parents' films are laugh riots, and I love the original. Both of them are great though.",Meet the Parents

59,blott2319-1,I hate movies that think it's funny to destroy the nice guy.,2,27 October 2021,"Meet the Parents falls into a genre of comedy that I've heard others describe as cringe comedy. In fact, this might be the poster-child for that little subgenre. It focuses entirely on a likeable guy who is always trying to do the right thing, and everything goes wrong for him. I am entirely incapable of laughing at that, in fact I find myself constantly annoyed and tense. I can't help sympathizing with Ben Stiller, and get unbelievably upset as if these things are happening to me. While this kind of thing might make some people laugh, for me it's like emotional torture porn. I knew it wasn't going to go well when the song over the Universal logo starts with the line ""Show me a man who is gentle and kind, and I'll show you a loser."" It's like they started with the thesis statement for Robert De Niro's character, and the film itself doesn't shy away from the fact that he might be right. I've never seen a bigger sad sack than Greg Focker.To add insult to the emotional injury of Meet the Parents, many of the events and characters in the film come across as exaggerated and ridiculous. I suppose some people find that allows them to laugh more because it's not like this is something that would really happen, but I was just more irritated by it. I also despise the fact that there are so many problems in this film that are exacerbated by people lying or just failing to have a simple conversation. I understand the screenwriters' logic for why these conversations don't happen, but this kind of basic lack of communication is a big pet peeve of mine. I also find that Teri Polo's character behaves despicably and seems to lack any empathy, as she is constantly not aware of how awful things are for her boyfriend. From beginning to end, Meet the Parents is torturous for me to watch, and I'll be happy to never watch anything like it again.",Meet the Parents
60,kevin c,BETTER THAN YOU'D THINK,4,19 December 2000,"De Niro isn't a comedian lets face it. However he puts in a decent performance here. The film's strength, is the fact that we've all been there. I didn't really see the need for some of the over-the-top gags, and the FOCKER gag is playground stuff. There's enough material there for a good, tense black comedy. Something Hollywood could never do. Okay, but I'd catch it on rental or cable if I were you.",Meet the Parents
61,mattymatt4ever,"Often funny, though over-the-top",7,25 April 2001,"""Meet the Parents"" is an over-the-top comedy that begs for laughs like a cinematic vagrant.  It attacks you at every corner, begging for some laughs, hoping you can spare some.  Luckily, I was generous and was gracious enough to donate a sufficient amount of laughs.  This is a boisterous sitcom of a movie that occasionally drives you nuts, but often pleases. 
Bobby D has made a fine transition to comedy, and although others feel he's not suited for the genre--being stuck on his Travis Bickle persona--I think he's cut out just fine for films of this kind.  You know why?  He doesn't GO for laughs.  He lets the laughs come to him, and disciplines the material to a reasonable level.  Ben Stiller, on the other hand, does the complete opposite.  Stiller can be extremely funny in roles in films like ""There's Something About Mary,"" but in lame roles like in ""Heavyweights"" he can be really obnoxious!  And sometimes he tries a bit too hard to get the laughs. So hard that you just want to shoot him with a tranquilizer dart.  During lame points of the script, Stiller tries to elevate the material to a good comical status, but instead ends up looking like a complete...idiot.  Like he should be locked up in a cage.  And it's not funny.  It's just obnoxious.I am going to reccomend this movie, because I can't deny I was laughing 75 percent of the time.  And that was my motive for seeing the movie.  Of course, that and I'm a big DeNiro fan.  However, there are moments where you just want to yell out at the director ""Enough already!  We get the joke!"" The makers of the film just merge way too many jokes into one scene, and it gets pretty lame and/or predictable at times.  My score:  7 (out of 10)",Meet the Parents
62,jhclues,Could Be The Perfect Comedy,10,12 October 2000,"How do you make a good first impression on and win over your prospective father-in-law on the very weekend you intend to ask for his first-born daughter's hand in marriage?  A tricky, touchy, very delicate and serious situation that must be faced and addressed by a young man in `Meet The Parents,' a hilarious comedy directed by Jay Roach and starring Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller.  Greg (Stiller) is in love; he knows Pam (Teri Polo) is the one he wants to spend the rest of his life with, and is ready to propose.  But certain circumstances clue him in to the fact that he should meet her parents first, approach her father, Jack (De Niro), and make the formal request, thereby extending him the respect he has come to understand Jack demands.  Plans are made, and the weekend begins with the flight from Chicago to New York.  And when a slight problem arises even before they board their plane, Greg should have seen it as an omen, because after that, absolutely nothing seems to go as planned. He finds Pam's mom, Dina (Blythe Danner), fairly accessible, but Jack turns out to be quite the formidable opponent, and from the minute they meet it becomes one long dance and spar of witticisms and revelations that make this one weekend Greg (and the audience) will never forget. 	What makes this movie so funny (and this IS one funny movie) is that the humor is character driven, situational and all very real; the laughs (and there are plenty) are all earned and are derived from inherently comical events and circumstances.  The ongoing banter between Greg and Jack is clever, the dialogue is superb and delivered with such sly and subtle shadings that it rings true at every turn.  And De Niro and Stiller play off of one another so perfectly and with such impeccable timing that it's like watching art come to life.  Stiller is a master at playing comedy dead-pan straight, and De Niro proves to be his equal here.  They never go after cheap laughs, and what little broad humor Roach employs evolves directly from the story and is never gratuitous or overdone; Roach and his cast let it all flow naturally and play it with a seriousness that makes it all the more hilarious.  You can literally feel Greg's pain and discomfort as he tries in vain to stand tall and impress this intimidating figure of a man he hopes will soon be his own father-in-law.  And De Niro makes Jack everything a suitor dreads in a prospective in-law; he doesn't merely scratch the surface of this character, but goes deep to make him a multi-layered personality, enigmatic and hard to read.  You know instinctively that there's more to this guy than meets the eye, and given the fact that nobody is good enough in his eyes for his little girl, he is a nightmare waiting for any and all `Gregs' that may come a-calling. 	Polo is charming as Pam; she's charismatic, has great screen presence and a winning personality that makes her character likable and totally believable. In a supporting role, Owen Wilson gives a stand-out performance as Pam's ex-boyfriend, Kevin; he so wryly underplays him, and what he does contrasts so well with what De Niro and Stiller are doing that it makes him one of the most memorable characters in the film.  Rounding out the excellent supporting cast are Nicole DeHuff (Debbie), Jon Abrahams (Denny), James Rebhorn (Larry) and Phyllis George (Linda).  With `Meet The Parents,' Roach leaves no doubt as to what he can do with a comedy; this film is filled with truly funny, memorable scenes and has an endless number of quotable lines, the best of which belongs to Jack (spoken to Greg ):  `If I find that you are trying to corrupt my first born child, I will bring you down, baby, I will bring you down to Chinatown'  In the final analysis, it's all a lot of fun, and there are many things here with which many viewers will readily identify.  This movie, in fact, may well be the perfect comedy; certainly it is nothing less than a modern-day classic that you do not want to miss.  I rate this one 10/10.",Meet the Parents

64,Stampsfightclub,enjoyable comedy,8,5 January 2007,"My View on the narrative:.Not being a fan of the slapstick comedy drama as such I had my doubts over this film, however I'm glad to say I was surprised when sitting down to watch a completely daft unrealistic comedy but that is simply good entertainment. Ben Stiller (There's something about Mary) stars as Greg Focker, a simple nervous soul put in a vulnerable position when his girlfriend takes him to meet her parents. The simple idea spells disaster and although it's a very ambitious plot, the nature behind it is there with physical humour (watch for the garden scene) which although not laugh out loud is easy to smile to. I often felt embarrassed for the characters as this film has plenty of those 'awkward' silence moments none of us want to be involved in when meeting the parents but the fact that this conforms to every person's nightmare by the central character Stiller making a complete hash of everything is comic genius. Robert De Niro.Surprised to see him in such a role, I was very intrigued. Gone are the days when we would see him pull on the boxing gloves to fight powerfully in Oscar winning Raging Bull and the days when he would mutter 'are you talking to me?' Saying this, I am very happy to say that for me he made this film great. His observation tough guy image is reflecting in his dominance of his household over his children and guests. The comic humour De Niro presents is obviously a contrast to his tough guys days but the 'bitchy' hard hitting lines he mutters simply made me smile throughout and he was the star of this film for me. Synopsis.Meet the parents conforms to the comedy genre brilliantly and through the sensationally stereotyped Robert De Niro as the dominant intimidating father the film is a joy to watch. Although certain scenes were too ambitious for my liking but there's no question its an enjoyable watch from start to finish.",Meet the Parents

Unlike their previous two films, ""Meet the Parents"" seems forced and contrived. Sure there are some laughs, but there is little humanity in this outing, it's more a cold fish. I found I didn't like either Stiller's or De Niro's characters. And the chemistry between any of the characters is missing. Therefore, for me, the jokes weren't funny, and were often disturbing.

It can be said that De Niro didn't really try that much for the performance but the parts that's easy to miss are the subtle details, and how he just nails the overprotective role, it's such a normal attribute of a man who have been through that much. Seeing him interact with Ben Stiller's character, Greg Focker is a male nurse and Pam's boyfriend. They are two completely different people with different personalities and the performances says a lot. Both Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro are great in this film, lots of the actors execute the dialogue perfectly which makes the comedic moments quite golden. This shows Ben Stiller at his best, his comedic style is perfect for the character.If we're going into the themes that ""Meet the Parents"" go into, they're quite a few. But the two big things to note is of course the cultural differences with Greg Focker being a middle-class Jewish nurse whose social and cultural position is much different than the Byrnes family of upper-class white protestants. The cultural differences are often highlighted, and how the writers made Greg aware of them made them achieve comedic effect through character development, they nailed the character driven comedy parts of the film and I can't praise them enough. It's also been commented upon as being indicative of thematic portrayal of Jewish characters' roles in modern film as well as being a prime example of how male nurses are portrayed in media which have sadly often been stereotyped in films and television but also in the world. One of the common misconceptions about men in nursing is that of a man who accepts a career in nursing as an unfortunate secondary career choice, either failing to become a physician or still trying to become one. Such stereotyping is due to a presumption that a man would prefer to be a physician but is unable to become one due to lack of intelligence or non-masculine attributes. Barbara Cherry said in her book ""Contemporary Nursing: Issues, Trends, & Management"" of the portrayal of Greg as a nurse, one of the most positive film portrayals of men who are nurses. That says a lot for representation.Meet the Parents is overall a great comedy film, doing things in a brilliant way in a story that have been done more times than I can count. Writing, direction and acting is great. Even the cinematography and musical score is impressive, better than I expected. To be honest, I didn't expect this film to be this good. It was brilliant.",Meet the Parents
68,stamper,Way better than Analyze This,8,19 February 2001,"Well I'm not going to make this another neverending comment, but I'll make it short. This is a god comedy and to those expecting very idiotic scenes because of Ben Stiller, you are right, there are some, but not enough to spoil the film, which is almost everything a love comedy should be. This is a good one, so go and see it. Oh yes, do not make the same mistake I did.

This is one of the best parts he's played in years, and most of the humor stems from his character.

I just don't think it's funny to watch Ben Stiller struggle through a weekend trying to get along with his parents as the movie and the script have already made it impossible for him to do so. Robert DeNiro is one of my favorite actors. He is a very likeable guy even playing a hard-nosed father-in-law. He does a very good job doing comedy, I'd like to see him do it a lot more, but the movie just isn't as funny as everyone thinks it is.

It is a little annoying.So, the first time I saw this, I loved it, the second time, I grew to dislike it a little bit.

So he goes to spend a weekend in her parents' home. Well, that weekend will not be easy to GREG, as an amount of unlucky occurrences happen, having always the same protagonist, GREG. Or I should say GAYLORD FOCKER (his real official name! LOL!).One more time Ben Stiller is great doing this kind of character. He's perfect performing the unlucky guy who just want a change but for whom everything gets always wrong! Robert De Niro, on his side, also performs a good and funny character, but that stills too close to his image. I thought that at least in this movie (a romantic comedy!) he wouldn't be a member of CIA Anyway I liked the performances from all actors. I just think that Owen Wilson's role is too short. Funny as he is he deserved better, but he was at the beginning of his career I suppose It's a funny and entertaining movie, with great laughs. Some of them made me cry of laughing!

75,rebeljenn,Meet the Parents: extremely funny,8,22 January 2006,"'Meet the Parents' is a brilliant take on a young man who goes to visit his girlfriend's parents for the first time. He is wanting to make an impression, but they just do not accept him and even make things difficult for him. They are strange themselves - the overbearing secret agent father, the druggie brother, the cat that can flush the toilet, and so on. The intentions of the young man are good, but he keeps getting himself into messes and more messes by attempting to do the right thing. This film is funny on many different levels, and I think that it can appeal to a wide audience because of the different types of humour shown. I do not care much for romantic comedy films, but this one had me laughing. Also, I would not bother with the sequel 'Meet the Fockers' at all because it is a totally different film and not at all consistent with the humour and feel of this film.

It seems to make matters worse, however, that he's also a male nurse, jewish, and his legal name is Gaylord Focker, in this movie which is about as pleasant as taking a visit to a tooth-pulling dentist who is against using anaesthetics.The riffing on Greg's name is primary-school grade humour, and has that feeling of a cheap joke, kind of that ""i can feel a song coming on"" feeling in bad musicals, just as bad is the ""we're throwing in a funny line"" feeling.This is one of those movies where everything you could imagine might go wrong - does - and always to the detriment of poor Ben Stiller. By the time the resolution started happening, it was too late. There were just too many bad things that happened to Greg Focker.All this is not to say that its bad quality. Stiller hits the uncomfortable fiance thing perfectly. And the script is good - there are many moments, especially within the first half hour, that anyone who's ever met the parents before can associate with. Is it enjoyable, though? No, i didn't think so. Ironically, its because they draw you in so much that its so upsetting. You simply can't accept these tragic situations as comedy - you feel too sorry for Greg Focker.The resolution is fairly forced and implausible.6/10. But not for me.

The film is surprisingly good with many memorable sequences as when De Niro and Stiller challenges each other in their cars. But we also have a nice small role in Owen Wilson (who's a great actor). The movie is so choosy and nice but in the same time hysterical as when Stiller climbs on the house roof and when De Niro takes the lie-detector on him.

79,Isaac5855,DeNiro and Stiller make a surprisingly effective comic duo...,7,28 March 2007,"MEET THE PARENTS was the surprise hit of 2000 that firmly established comic credentials for dramatic actor Robert DeNiro and put Ben Stiller on the map. Ben plays Greg Focker, a male nurse who after becoming engaged to a schoolteacher (Teri Polo) nervously agrees to accompany her to her sister's wedding in order to meet his future father-in-law (DeNiro). Greg is naturally freaking out and try as he may, once he and Dad meet, everything that can go wrong for Greg does and it just gets worse for him as the story progresses. Stiller is wonderful as the hassled and harried everyman whose intentions are always good but the end results are never what he planned. But the real surprise here is two-time Oscar winner DeNiro in a deft comic turn as Jack Burns, the father-in-law from hell who turns out to be a former CIA agent. DeNiro proves to be equally adept at comedy here, instinctively knowing when to take center stage and when to let young Stiller shine. Polo is attractive as Pam, the woman caught between these two guys and Blythe Danner is lovely as Jack's wife and Pam's mother. Owen Wilson also provides some grins as Pam's ex-fiancée who Jack adores. Though the misery that gets heaped on Greg throughout the length of the film seems to be a bit much, the smart screenplay and attractive cast make for an entertaining comic romp.

Meet the parents is a decent comedy, has its moments, probably one of the best slapstick Hollywood works. Stiller is decent, its a perfect role for him (probably written especially for him), he shines. Meanwhile DeNiro's performance, although having its very funny moments (highlights of the film), is still only mediocre. The rest of the cast is decent for a simple comedy. I don't know about the high rating on IMDb (7.0 average is very good), i didn't think this film was any more special than most comedies, although it was funny.

82,Movie-12,"One of the funniest comedies of the year, De Niro and Stiller make the perfect comedy pair. *** (out of four)",7,1 November 2000,"MEET THE PARENTS / (2000) *** (out of four)By Blake French:	The main character in ""Meet The Parents"" is a Chicago-based male nurse, Greg Focker (pronounced just how it is spelled) who realizes how unlucky a person can be. He is about to propose to his schoolteacher girlfriend, Pam (Teri Polo), when her sister Debbie (Nicole Dehuff) calls and explains that her new fiancé, Dr. Bob Banks (Tom McCarthy), received a blessing from her father before he asked the question. This information makes Greg reconsider his method of choice, and instead jumps at the opportunity to meet Pam's overprotective parents when they fly to the east coast two weeks later to arrange Debbie's wedding. 	At the airport, the attendants loose Greg's parcels. Thus he arrives without any luggage. Once at Pam's parent's house, they exchange greetings and aquatint themselves with each other. Pam's parents, Jack and Dina Byrnes (Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner) learn about Greg's unusual last name, that he does not like cats, and is a male nurse, all facts that do not settle well with Pam's father. Greg does manage to gift Jack with a pleasant supply of rare flowers. However, even though Pam explained to Greg  that her dad is in the hobby of rare flowers, he does not seem too impressed.
	Even More complications ensue, especially when Greg learns of Jack's peculiar behaviors and suspicious gadgets, such as a polygraph and hidden cameras placed in every room of the house, as well as meeting Pam's brother, Denny (Jon Abrahams), and Debbie's soon to be in laws, Larry (James Rebhorn), and Linda Banks (Phillis George), and Pam's wealthy ex-fiancée, Kevin Rawley (Owen Wilson). Soon, Greg's chances of receiving Jack's permission to wed his daughter become less and less probable as his bad luck only manages to increase. 	The film introduces Greg and Pam with silly quirks that come up later in the story. Pam's parents are also quite the treat; the movie does not go over the top but portrays them with serious humor and charismatic wit. It is De Niro and Stiller who make the movie, however. They form an very effective comedic chemistry, even more amusing than the likable shtick between De Niro and Billy Crystal in ""Analyze This."" The filmmakers take advantage of the phenomenal tension between Greg and Jack, and place them in one hilarious situation after another. 	While outrageous and at times explosively funny, director Jay Roach takes the plot seriously. His previous films, including the Austin Powers films and ""Mystery, Alaska,"" have had trouble with taking anything seriously. But ""Meet The Parents"" has emotional connections, develops solid empathy for Greg, and we really believe he has something precious that can be lost: Pam.
	The movie does not completely develop romantic chemistry between Ben Stiller and Teri Polo, thus there were times when I simply did not believe the two were really in love. The relationship sometimes feels trite and contrived. There are also important plot nuggets left only partially examined: Jack's pot-head son, who could have contributed a lot more to the drug related material, is left as a plot device to provide another string of conflicts within Jack and Greg. 	I really enjoyed the whimsical performances and opportune casting. Ben Stiller reprises his ""There's Something About Mary"" role, with cute charm and the obscured zany flippancy. Robert De Niro is perfect in a role he was born to play, with serious attitude that results in the main portion of the film's funny moments. Blythe Danner is also charming in a kind of role that is becoming all too usual for her.	""Meet the Parents"" is one of the funniest movies of the year. It gives audiences with a solid story that does not interfere with the comic material, but contributes to it. The top notch performances and lively direction also raise the film to a higher level. During a year in which effective comedies are an endangered species, ""Meet The Parents"" is a landmark achievement in light entertainment.",Meet the Parents
83,the red duchess,A modern comedy classic with emotional depth.,8,21 December 2000,"With a hero called Gaylord M. Focker, you might expect this to be a film of snickering silliness.  It IS snickeringly silly - the soon-to-be-immortal champagne/urn scene; the cat-milking discussion; the skimpy swimming trunks; the volleyball bloodbath; the flushing cat; the wooden altar conflagration; the septic tank spray etc.; all good, healthy, daft, slapstick, prurient, scatalogical stuff.  And while I in no way condone Greg's vile rage directed at the air-stewardess, it is very funny.But, 'Meet the Parents' has the emotional truths that turn it from being merely a funny film into a comedy classic.  Anyone who has ever been married or about to will recognise the horrible accuracy of this film.  My own father-in-law is remarkably like Jack Byrnes here; not that he is an ex-CIA spycatcher (at least, I don't think so); but in his ability to intimidate, humiliate, terrorise, impose his power.My point is that Jack's profession is only a comic exaggeration of what all fathers- or mothers-in-law are like, figures terrified of losing their children, defending them like animals in the wild, convinced that a prospective so-and-so will never be good enough for our baby, not even thinking that neither might they have been; refusing to admit they are getting old, that they are losing power and control.It's only logical that the monster in-law from hell should be obsessive about power and control.  His domestic panopticon is a superb metaphor for extended family life, the idea of being judged, marked on 'success' or 'suitability' ratings, your every personal, financial, health etc. problem a matter for family investigation.  Bitter, moi?  Greg should be lucky Jack isn't married to Monica Geller's mom.But the film doesn't simplistically pit Capraesque good guy Greg against shady CIA man Jack.  If Jack is all about control, then so is Greg.  The film has one of the best musical openings in recent memory ('if you're gentle and sweet, you're an idiot...'), but the opening montage is more sinister, as a faceless cameraman takes home movies of a pretty blonde. Pam is the true victim of this film, the prize in a macho battle of wits, the female bystander in the great masculine generational conflict, as Jack proves he's not past it, and Greg proves he's not a loser.  Those voyeuristic home movies echo Jack's surveillance cameras and perform the same function, to watch, to control, to limit (just as Kevin remembers Pam by his photographs and his erotic memories).One is heartened by the ironies of the ending, not just Jack breaking his word, determined to keep up his power games as he watches his CCTV's filming the most private places, where people are at their most vulnerable and exposed (revealing, truthfully, that the in-law struggle never ends)The film also has some cutting things to say about the lingering anti-semitism in WASPish society; nothing much has changed since 'Auntie Mame'.It is wonderful to see Robert de Niro finally getting a decent comedy.  He has always been hilarious in 'straight' roles ('Mean Streets', 'Taxi Driver', 'Raging Bull' etc.), but his comic vehicles have spluttered to a halt.  He is genius here, his menace, his gestures, facial contortions, way of throwing out a line like he's garrotting it - bliss.  If 'Parents' finally lacks the pull of a film like 'There's Something About Mary', then it's probably the nature of the plot.  'Mary' had an active plot, it was a quest, necessitating narrative and character development, and thus more audience commitment.  'Parents' is purely destructive, as Jack tries to destroy a love that's already been built up.  Sadly, this scenario is much truer.",Meet the Parents
84,FlickJunkie-2,"Don't expect ""Mary""",7,8 March 2001,"At $165 Million, this film was number seven at the box office for 2000. Though it is funny in parts, as is often the case with blockbusters I am left scratching my head at its runaway popularity.  Comparisons with `There's Something About Mary' are unavoidable.  Ben Stiller plays the same kind of sincere but hapless character in each film and they both have a wry and offbeat presentation.  However, the humor in this film is far more lowbrow than `Mary'.  It is also highly predictable.  The least perceptive of viewers can see the outcome of each gag a mile away.I suppose there is an element of identification with the premise, since most people remember their own consternation at the big meeting with the parents of their beloved.  Perhaps the appeal of the film is that we love to laugh at people who are more luckless than we are, and Greg (Ben Stiller) clearly has no equal when it comes to the bad luck he has in this film.Ben Stiller is fast establishing himself as one of the most accomplished Sad Sacks in film today.  He portrays characters with such sincerity and misfortune that you can't help but love him.  In this film, he continues that tradition with an outstanding performance as Greg.  Robert De Niro, who is a great dramatic actor, continues his recent trend away from serious drama and toward offbeat comedy roles (`Flawless', `Analyze This', `Rocky and Bullwinkle').  Although his very presence in films like this is comical due to its incongruity, he is not a particularly good comedian.  I'm looking forward to seeing him in his latest film `Fifteen Minutes' which is a more serious dramatic role better suited to his enormous talent.  I was very impressed with Teri Polo, who played Pam.  She has genuineness and an affable nature that is well suited for romantic comedy.This is a good comedy, but nowhere near as good as the box office would lead us to believe.  I rated it a 7/10.  It is a fun flick with absurdly exaggerated humor and numerous belly laughs, but don't expect it to be as good as `Mary'.",Meet the Parents

I eagerly went to the movie theater on the evening with a friend who had come from Washington, and I was so disappointed when the showing, and the next one, was sold out. When I saw it about a couple weeks later, I understood why it had.Meet the Parents starts off with Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) saying a love-speech to a patient in the hospital where he nurses, to see how it sounds for his pop of the question later in the day. When a funny turn of events make him not say the speech, his girlfriend Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo) is taking him to meet her parents before proposing.Greg obviously is nervous, and meeting Jack (Robert De Nero), Pam's dad, doesn't do anything to help. Robert De Nero has a knack for comedy, which seems to be his main thing nowadays. He's very good as the perceptive and yet naive father of teacher Pam.Blythe Danner, who is underused in the movie, plays Jack's loving wife, Dina, who likes Greg and doesn't like Jack digging so deep into Pam's boyfriend's lives. Greg gives the Byrnes a gift-a rare plant. Pam had told Greg that Jack was a retired florist; what Greg doesn't know is that Jack is actually a retired CIA agent, which makes sense, since Jack is less than thrilled at the gift. It's obvoius that Jack doesn't approve of Greg, but Dina and Pam tell him to take it easy on Greg. Yeah, right.Pam's sister, Deborah (Nicole DeHuff), is getting married to Dr. Bob Banks (Thomas McCarthy) in the Byrnes homestead while Jack is living there. Do you think the wedding will go flawless? One of the only things I don't like about Meet the Parents is that it has too many seconday characters, like Dr. Bob's father, Dr. Larry (James Rebhorn) and Bob's mother, Linda (Phyllis George). But if you don't really pay attention to those people (although they're needed later in the movie), it works better.As more and more mishaps happen by Greg, Jack more and more dislikes him. He pains to like, or at least tolerate, Greg for the women's sakes, but it's tough. Luckily he's got hidden cameras around the house to look at him 24-7. Why is it so funny? Because it's by the director of the Austin Powers series, Jay Roach. Although Meet the Parents doesn't have the randiness of Austin Powers, it still holds some laughs.Overall, Meet the Parents is a very funny movie that doesn't lack on plot and doesn't stoop to the Austin Powers level. The supporting characters leave something to be desired, but that doesn't even dent the otherwise wonderful and comedic movie that we have here.My rating: 8/10Rated PG-13 for language, sexual humor, and drug refrences/content.",Meet the Parents

""Meet the Parents"" is not the best comedy ever made, but it'll do until the next very funny comedy comes along.*** (out of four)",Meet the Parents

95,AKS-6,Funny and entertaining,7,30 December 2000,"Since I didn't expect much before I saw this film, I was quite surprised when Meet the Parents turned out to be very entertaining and funny from the beginning to the end. Most comedies are very funny the first thirty minutes or so and then keeps going and going with about one joke per 15 minutes. That's not the case with this movie. Sure, one can discuss whether Ben Stiller can play more than one character or not, but his acting style suits this film perfectly. Of course, De Niro is brilliant as the father-in-law from hell. Meet the Parents is a genuinely funny and entertaining comedy. (7/10)",Meet the Parents

When Pam invites Greg to spend the next few days with her parents in New York, where they will attend her sister's wedding rehearsal, Greg realizes this is the best opportunity to meet the parents and ask for Pam's hand in marriage. Soon after their arrival at the Byrnes' mansion, while trying to dismiss the ill-experience of having lost his suitcase in transit, Greg greets Jack (Robert De Niro) and his wife (Blythe Danner) with optimism. Yet Greg 's efforts to be liked and respected aim in all the wrong directions to either disappoint or offend Jack, a retired horticulturist who lacks a sense of humor and who decides to become Greg's most adverse judge.Meet the Parents follows Greg Focker along a comical series of misadventures aimed at testing the character's composure as he struggles to disprove his faultfinding father-in-law. Never abandoning its central character's good intentions yet emphasizing its antagonist's unattainable consent, Meet the Parents also creates a few bittersweet moments as it questions the future of the character's plans to wed his increasingly distant girlfriend. Meet the Parents successfully exploits the viewer's familiarity with such stressful situations as proposing, meeting a loved one's parents or planning a wedding, and creates its comedy by pushing to the extreme its subject's numerous embarrassing and compromising positions.",Meet the Parents
97,DavidSim240183,One of those rare comedies that has everything!,9,25 November 2003,"When I first heard about this film, I had my doubts Robert De Niro could do comedy. His previous work has never really embraced the art of slapstick. But I'm happy to say he pulled this particular role off in spades. Meet the Parents and Midnight Run are among his finest comedies because of the way they skillfully avoid conventional clichés. It begins with male nurse Greg Focker (Ben Stiller, and yes, Focker is his actual name) wanting to propose to his girlfriend Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo). But just as he's about to pop the question, he learns her sister Debbie is about to get married. But her fiancé asked her father's permission first, so Greg decides to do the same before he marries Pam.He uses Debbie's wedding as an opportunity to meet Pam's parents, where he can ask for permission. So far, so good. But things quickly take a downward spiral for Greg. Pam's father Jack Byrnes (Robert De Niro) takes an instant dislike to Greg, (being a male nurse doesn't help matters) and in his eyes, Greg can't do a thing right.Much to Greg's consternation, Jack was in the CIA for 34 years. Jack is an expert at spotting lies, and Greg's eagerness to please leads him to tell harmless white lies that balloon into an elaborate web of lies. They become so elaborate (Greg is a dab-hand at cat-milking) even Greg can't keep up with them. Because of this, every attempt he makes to please Jack backfires in a spectacular fashion.From losing the cat, Mr Jinks (who Jack is crazy about), to burning down the wedding altar, Greg is a potential accident waiting to happen. The reason I like Meet the Parents is because it's one of those rare comedies that has everything. Ben Stiller does an excellent job trying to appear like a suitable husband to be, and making a complete mess of things (the dinner table scene is a definite highlight). Not to mention how hilarious it is watching Greg back himself into corners and then trying to squirm his way out of them.Robert De Niro is also excellent, using his trademark sinister characteristics to great effect when judging Greg. They both have a terrific chemistry, and every gag in the film is tailor-made for their talents. A lot of people can relate to Greg in this film, because of meeting prospective parents to be and how to relate to them properly. A lot of their ""heart to hearts"" are hilarious, especially the way they degenerate into nightmarish situations for Greg:""Right now look Focker. I'm a patient man. That's what 19 months in a Vietnamese prison camp will do to you. Now I will be watching you. Studying your every move. And if I find that you are trying to corrupt my first-born child, I will bring you down baby! I will bring you down to Chinatown!""Mrs Byrnes is good too (Blythe Danner), who's brilliantly quirky and all the more likable for it. She's the only member of the family that likes Greg, while the others unfairly crucify him every chance they get. Although at times, it's understandable why they do.Owen Wilson puts in an excellent performance as Pam's oh-so-perfect ex-boyfriend Kevin. He stands out very well among the whole family, while some of the others fade into the background. That may be the only complaint I have. With so many family members present they're not given enough to do.Without giving too much away, the film has an ending that is very satisfying. Greg going insane at an air-hostess is one of the funniest things I've ever seen in a film, as is Greg getting a few things off his chest about being Jack's son-in-law.Overall, the jokes range from small to enormous. Some are packed away into the background for you to find. Like a rare flower Greg buys to impress Jack. To the casual observer its a flower pot filled with soil. Because the flower hasn't bloomed yet. In a later scene, the pot is put with the other flowers, where it looks really out of place. Its jokes like these that impress the most for the way the filmmakers don't draw attention to them. Subtle puns that only further illustrate how far apart Greg stands from the Byrnes clan. Which is why you feel such sympathy for Greg while you're laughing at his misfortunes. A rare thing.A magnificent film, and the best comedy I've seen since Groundhog Day. Because of it's simple theme and a stellar cast, Meet the Parents becomes something quite special. It avoids all of the obvious pitfalls, it never becomes tedious, and there's quite a bit of subtlety to the slapstick as the embarrassing humiliations escalate steadily.I can't wait for the sequel!",Meet the Parents
98,TaylorYee94,Poor Greg.. and it's not that funny,6,12 October 2021,"Rather than being funny, 'Meet the Parents' makes people uncomfortable, having to watch all family members ganging up on Greg. I understand why Jack has to be rude to create comical exchange of lines or tense relationship to lead the story. However, Bob's family and Denny adding up and being rude without enough justification is just too much. If it is the tension only between Jack and Greg, audience can laugh about it, but the whole family versus Greg looks like bullying, and it becomes harder to just laugh about it.",Meet the Parents
99,willcundallreview,A comedy with Stiller at his most awkwardly best,7,29 March 2015,"Rating-7/10 Meet the Parents is a comedy and almost kind of romance movie that boats a stellar cast and some funny lines. The humour here is spread out well and the laughs don't just all come in one scene or the other, it makes you laugh at the end and the beginning too. I think the majority of the laughs are more physical than what they say, but what I will add is that when Greg(Ben Stiller) says certain lines, they come off brilliantly. I felt it was just about good and here below is why.The cast here seem excellent and Ben Stiller as I mentioned is cast well in the lead role as Greg, his physical humour matches up to his line delivery and both combine very well. Robert De Niro as the father in law Jack is great as well, he somehow seems to mix serious but still feel funny and all credit to him on this one. Teri Polo as Pam, Greg's finance, is well cast and so even is Blythe Danner including people like Owen Wilson too to create a first rate bunch of characters. It's written well, now what I will say is that the script doesn't quite produce as memorable scenes as some of the more physical jokes do but there still funny anyway. John Hamburg and Jim Herzfeld do a good job as I say writing this and both seem to combine past experiences well, with Hamburg who worked with Stiller on ""Zoolander"" yet again bringing out the laughs and the type of humour we have come to expect.I think the director Jay Roach is probably the best thing in a way about this, yes you may say how is it not Stiller, but Roach is the master here when it comes to the most memorable parts, and a lot of the laughs. Roach seems to be able to not only get good delivery, but make things very awkward, and part of you even feels awkward watching it at times. Now Meet the Parents isn't the funniest film you will ever see, if it is then there is much else out you need to see, but it does stand tall when it comes to comedy, and laughs can be had a plenty everywhere. I think although it is a typical comedy type plot, the jokes and the cast involved+ some memorable scenes create a movie that is new when it comes to jokes and even maybe creates a new type of Rom-Com.On the jokes side again, pretty much any scene where it goes wrong for Greg is funny, whether he is hurt, hurts somebody or basically does something to destroy something, It makes not only Stiller's reactions funnier, but also how the cast react, just hilarious on that side of things. I also think how De Niro goes from actually kind of nice to angry in a matter of seconds is perfect, top class acting from the great.So overall I think this is a good movie, just scraping into being good but still a good one. I think the reason it isn't great is that it isn't smart ENOUGH, it is smart but there could have been some better jokes or maybe even this type of plot just only works to a certain point. Nevertheless I can't recommend this more, whether you like Ben Stiller, Robert De Niro or any of the cast involved, your sure to have a great time and laugh a lot along the way.",Meet the Parents

So basically this movie mostly consists on Focker traveling with his girlfriend for a wedding to also meet her parents. From start to finish this movie entertains and definitely delivers the laughs. Robert De Niro is normally known as a serious actor and even though he may come off as a little serious in this movie, he definitely is funny as hell when he plays Jack Byrnes.

102,postmanwhoalwaysringstwice,Stiller Strikes Again,7,27 November 2007,"It's not entirely clear why Ben Stiller continues to get work and acclaim for his performances, since he really doesn't do much at all. His main role in any given film is to stand there and look dumbfounded as the world falls apart around him. He played one of his most successful versions of this when he played Gaylord Focker. The first time was in ""Meet the Parents"", which was a remake of a little seen independent film. Stiller plays a male nurse, a detail that punctuates several of the running jokes. He goes home with his fiancée for a wedding, at which point Murphy's Law strikes, his patience is tested, and all of that.Robert DeNiro is here too, fresh off his uncharacteristic comic turn in ""Analyze This"". He plays the fiancée's overbearing, ultra-critical, highly suspicious father. It's a role that was originally slated for Christopher Walken, who would have ruined it with an added sense of creepiness. The main meat of the film comes from the tug-of-war between DeNiro's psychological testing and Stiller's struggle to be heard and accepted. This is a classic formula that works surprisingly well as a modern-day screwball comedy, given the weaknesses in Stiller and his irritating and frequent co-star Owen Wilson.""Meet the Parents"" is a formulaic comedy with a bit of a dark streak. It's a decent movie with some memorable bits, but it's more of a trial to get through than enjoyable which is something ironed out in time for the sequel.",Meet the Parents
103,EthanBJones_03,A perfectly passable way to pass the time,6,13 August 2017,"MEET THE PARENTS - 2000Directed by Jay RoachStarring Ben Stiller, Robert De Niro and Terri PoloPlot Overview:​ Everything that can possibly go wrong for groom-to-be Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) does. The problems begin with Greg's disastrous first meeting with his girlfriend's family -- most notably her intimidating father Jack Byrnes (Robert De Niro) and it's all downhill from there.This is a fine movie. It isn't good. It is not great. It is a perfectly passable way to spend your time. There is an odd trend with comedy movies I have watched recently. A painfully long and slow start with no laughs or smiles but then then, when the ball gets rolling, I start to consistently laugh. I am confident that people will find this movie infinitely more funny and interesting than me but then I guess I am just not their demographic. And that is unfortunate.The idea for this movie is pretty fun and I have no doubt relatable to many. As to the actual plot, it is competently written and has a flowing narrative but I think they set it up way too much to make Focker seem loathsome. The situations he gets into are logical with the plot and are sometimes funny but they went way overboard with making me dislike Focker. I like the ending; it's funny and works well within context of the plot.I don't like Ben Stiller as an actor in most things he is in and that is no different here. His performance is pretty lazy and his character is so loathsome that I couldn't in good conscience root for him. I can not stand his character. He possessed no charming or likable qualities and was just an all around boring character.Robert De Niro was great in this movie. He cracked the perfect balance of lovable and loathsome and did it with a smile. Jack is a really fun and interesting character and both supports and negates the overall stereotype that the film is about.The performances from the supporting cast were all fine but I wasn't interested in any of their characters.The editing and cinematography were both passable.This movie started off REALLY slow and unfunny but, as time progressed, the jokes began to hit more and more frequently and I found myself laughing a lot more than I did in the beginning. That said, I didn't laugh nearly as much as I would usually do in a comedy. The gags became stale for me and it all relied on the characters being in 'hilarious and awkward situations'. This worked on occasion but the more they did it, the less fun it became.De Niro's performance and the occasional funny moments give me enough to cautiously recommend this movie. See it if you must but I can't say you will become enlightened. I'll rate his film 6 Spray- painted cats out of 10!",Meet the Parents

No, it's not. It's just a way to get to retell some old jokes and some stupid situations, and in the end it sorts itself out (and don't insult your own intelligence and call that a spoiler).It's funny, of course. Some things are actually quite clever (I like it when he spray-paints a cat to make it look like the family cat), but there's nothing new to the basic idea. Even de Niro was a bit dull to watch.

106,tastyhotdogs,One of the best comedies of the millennium,9,20 November 2005,"When I first heard about this pairing coming together for this movie, I was pretty excited. Even though he's starting to bug me now, Ben Stiler is one of the best comedy actors of the last 15 years. Put him together with in my opinion the best actor ever in DeNiro, and give them a half decent script, and hilarity should follow. DeNiro has done some terrible comedies, most notably the ""Analyse This"" series, two movies based around a ""emotionally fragile"" mafia boss. C'mon! ""Meet the Parents"" focuses on Greg (Stiller) and girlfriend Pam going to see Pam's parents in the hope of softening them up for a marriage proposal. Greg is understandably nervous and when a few things start going wrong, he begins to break. The movie is full of brilliant one liners, sight gags, tragedy gags and lots more. Most of it is based around some dark or unlikely events which nonetheless have you in stitches. There's also a fine cameo by Owen Wilson, playing Pam's ex.The teaming of DeNiro and Stiller works brilliantly and this has to be one of the great comedies of the 2000's.WARNING: Do not see the sequel to this ""Meet The Parents 2"" under any circumstances. It is a pure cash in on the first and very little effort went into the script. One of the worst sequels ever. I think I laughed twice.",Meet the Parents

The characters in this movie are not exaggerated. They exist, believe me. And that's what I find so great about it: it discovers the simple every-day embarrassments of life. Life is not like in the movies: things do not simply work!I didn't laugh very often during the movie, but I grinned without interruption from MARRY ME MAP` right until the end.

We've all had our experiences of bad first impressions, failed conversations, and overall just embarrassing moments the first time we meet the parents. Meet the Parents (the film) takes all these to the next level showing how bad a first impression may get. Doesn't seem like something that can make a story but it holds its own. Just look at the two leads and you'll know why the film works.Greg is a male nurse with a lovely girlfriend named Pam. Greg is considering asking her to marry him. Greg, however, must meet the parents first. He hopes to make a good first impression then do an old school move and ask Pam's father for his daughters hand in marriage. Greg sees this as polite while everyone else sees it as a waste of time. Fate seems to have other plans for Greg as everything that could go wrong does go wrong and he tries to impress the hard nosed father bent on not letting anyone take his daughter away from him.The film follows Greg for the most part as he struggles to impress Pam's stern father, Jack, and caring mother, Dina. Stiller really does a good job as the struggling Greg. He has some great spurts of humor and the pool scene is one of his funniest moments to date. I couldn't have seen anyone else in the role of Greg other then Ben Stiller. He is just too good in these kind of roles. I really do think this was one of his best roles of his career.Robert De Niro is one of Hollywood's top actors. He's one of your greatest actors in history. To see him in a comedy did not make much sense to me after seeing him in films such as The Godfather and The Deer Hunter. However, I underestimated De Niro. He has a great sense of humor and a great comedy style. His seriousness makes it all the funnier when something wrong happens and his constant saying of Greg's last name ""Focker"" brings a laugh every time.Meet the Parents is well written, well acted, and well directed. There are a few slow parts and a few unnecessary parts. Somethings you know could just never happen but this is why it is a comedy film. The impossible happens. De Niro and Stiller propel the film to being a decent film. I enjoyed it and like seeing it every once and a while. There is nothing bad in the film. No heavy language, no nudity, no violence. Just good old fun for a family audience. 3/5 stars",Meet the Parents

After repeated viewings, you'll still enjoy it, even though you won't laugh as much or often. This fact applies not just to this movie, but comedies in general. I still get a kick out of the part where Ben Stiller is laughed at by two of the relatives because they don't believe he's a nurse. Not a big part, but funny nonetheless.

It has its cringe-worthy moments, it has its hilarious happenings and it has its occasional disgusting humour (especially when Focker flushes the toilet and covers the back garden in poo), but it actually manages to fit in a real plot and real character, rather than just feeling like some sort of overlong sketch show. A lot of the humour relies heavily on Focker getting himself into very sticky situations - and some of the more serious things will have you cringing to death. As the movie continues, luck gets worse for Focker and the cringe factor gets higher, until the end in which everything is resolved. From cats to shrines, Focker finds himself having trouble with everything he encounters. The ending sets the scene for the sequel - which was just as good, if not better. Sometimes the emotions become painful in the film - especially at the dinner table when Jack reads the poem in memory of his mother - which only helps to make Focker get into even more trouble.

The whole family and their friends VS Mr.Gaylord Focker (Ben Stiller). A father-in-law to be is not just an overly literal and abundantly-overbearing wall in the way of the progress of asking with the best intentions for the man's daughters hand in marriage. Every time he turns around someone in that family of Pam's is verbally being cold blooded or condescending toward Greg Focker aka Gaylord, and then laughing about it. Or even accusing him of doing things that he hasn't done. With a case of nerves as it is it doesn't help to be even more nervous and doing something by mistake that will be under a finer micro-scope by the parents and friend of the wedding party. From the supposed pot smoking that they accused him of to lying about his taking the 'M Cats' test to anything else that they feel like saying to him, or about him. This reminded me of my past in-laws. What a freaking mess.The breakfast scene where he enters their kitchen in pjs and the grooms mother quips, ""looks like someone had a visit from the hair fairy."" Then on Greg's way out of the kitchen to go shower, he jokes and sez, ""Well I guess it's time for me to visit the shower fairy."" And everyone just looks at him as if to say 'Oh Greg grow up'. I can identify with most of this whole feature. The director was brilliant in making an awkwardly close to the bone for me, movie about unwed bliss. DeNiro is masterful in this role. He is simply the one that fits it to a tee. Well scripted and maintained through out the entire story, this one with Owen Wilson was a spectacle to look and laugh and cringe at all at the same time while feeling awkward and gawky and nervously smiling with the rest of the nervous fiancée's out there.This was a one of a kind fun-filled slightly bend out of shape picture with an original feel, that makes it not equal to all the other cinema fare out there that 'comes and goes' with little staying power.Jay Roach is a cool and talented director.

123,ryan_kuhn,Fearing Papa De Niro,7,13 February 2005,"For a man, there is nothing worse than meeting your woman's father. Fear and trepidation do not even begin to describe what it's like to meet the father. And nothing can prepare any man for meeting your girlfriend's father when he is Robert de Niro. This is the main problem Ben Stiller's character faces in the 2000 surprise comedy Meet The Parents. Stiller plays a male nurse with the unfortunate name of Greg Focker, dating pre-school teacher Pam Byrnes played by Teri Polo. Pam's sister is getting married back in her native Long Island, so a weekend trip is in store for the happy couple. After losing his luggage and being spit up on my a baby, Greg meets the man of the house Jack Byrnes (de Niro). Through various misunderstandings and lying to cover up the misunderstandings, Greg begins to fall out of favor with Jack. Stiller has a wonderful knack of displaying insecurity, and that severs him well in Meet the Parents. He knows he is not living up to the standards of Jack, especially when he meets Pam's former fiancé, played by Owen Wilson. The more uncomfortable Greg is, the more he squirms, the more he lies, and the deeper he gets. The final scenes are great, especially the one dealing with the airline workers who are on autopilot, and poor Greg almost causes an international incident. The movie is cute, has plenty of laughs, and puts most men into a situation they can relate to, and fear more than an all-day Oprah marathon.",Meet the Parents
124,TuckMN,Much ado about very little.,6,7 November 2000,"After all the hype and great box office I was really expecting to be wowed by this movie  I was not.There are some funny lines and good acting by a good cast but over all it felt like a much longer movie than its 107 minute runtime  Frankly, I was bored through most of it.Probably because, even though Ben Stiller did a good job of playing Greg (Gaylord) Focker, I just couldn't relate to him  and it is important for you (the audience) to be able to relate to his situation in order to laugh at the predicament(s) he gets himself into.At one point Jack Byrnes (Robert De Niro) asks Greg if he trusts people and then makes the assertion that you can't trust any one.' So basically, Greg should have taken his cue from what Jack said and simply not trusted anyone or the situations that presented themselves to him.The only real message here is that lying doesn't work and compounding your lies with even more lies will only dig you deeper into a hole.This is a lesson that Greg doesn't learn until the very end of the movie  and even then you aren't sure he has really learned the lesson.Blythe Danner is her usual beautiful self and does a good job of playing the too-good-to-be-true' wife of the neurotic Jack.Owen Wilson, who just did a stellar turn in `Shanghai Noon,' is pretty much unbelievable as the goody-two-shoes that was Pam Byrnes' (Teri Polo) former fiancé. No one is that white-bread.Teri Polo is not an actress I am familiar with  but I want to see more of her.  She was very appealing as the daughter of a wildly dysfunctional family.This is a movie that you should wait to see at home on video so you can fast forward through the slow parts  you won't miss a thing.",Meet the Parents
125,WubsTheFadger,Meet the Parents,5,17 February 2018,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerFirst off, the story does have some funny parts, like all the destruction, but it is mostly a romance than a comedy. The story is a little slow and most of jokes didn't make me laugh.The acting is good. Robert De Niro, Owen Wilson, Teri Polo, Nicole DeHuff, and Blythe Danner all perform well. Ben Stiller is the same character he plays in all of his other movies. He, in my eyes, doesn't perform well.The pacing is slow and the runtime is overlong.All in all, this film is a romance first and a comedy second.Pros: Some funny jokes, the disaster scenes, some good acting, and a good romance storyCons: Ben Stiller's performance, slow pacing, an overlong runtime, some unfunny jokes, and this film is a romance not a comedyOverall Rating: 5.0",Meet the Parents

I just believe it failed to meet the standard that should be met to qualify for an 8.I suspect the audience I saw it with would, by and large, give it an 8 or better. There was a lot of laughing - and some by me. The movie had enjoyable characters and some entertaining circumstances.However, it had a couple serious flaws. In the first place the beginning and end were good - very easily 8 caliber. The middle 45 minutes or so, however were difficult to watch. The torture that Matt Damon had to go through was actually painful - not funny.Also, the biases that the other characters had against his character were unreasonable and unbelievable. But, worst of all was how quickly they came around to befriend him near the end of the movie based on very little reason.I found the movie somewhat disjointed and I'm barely able to recommend it.",Meet the Parents

His stay at their house is, lets say, unconventional, as however hard Greg tries to impress it always backfires making him look worse and worse after each sorry event.

My favorite part of the movie is when Greg loses Jack's cat Jinxie and tries to cover up the accident by buying another cat that looks like Jinxie. That part really had me laughing. I also like the part when Greg visits Pam's old boyfriend.

129,Bravesfan17,A great Ben Stiller comedy,8,21 May 2010,"Ben Stiller has shown throughout the years that he does great at starring in fun comedies, and this is no exception. Stiller stars as Greg Focker, a male nurse who is going to meet his girlfriend's parents for the weekend and ask her father for approval to marry Pam, the aforementioned girlfriend. Stiller creates a character that is hilarious, believable, and one that many can relate to.Robert De Niro steals the show as Jack Byrnes, a former CIA agent who is a nice guy but has strict rules. There are times when he suspects and knows that Greg is up to no good, but is accepting of who Greg is and isn't afraid to say anything. Jack likes to have fun but makes Greg nervous. Nobody can pull off the chemistry better than De Niro and Stiller do in these roles.Teri Polo plays Greg's girlfriend Pam and Blythe Danner plays Jack's wife Dina. They both do fine jobs but are not given a whole lot to do.Director Jay Roach takes an idea of what it'll be like to spend a weekend with a girlfriend's parents and makes an original story out of it. Roach is great at telling funny and heartfelt stories. Roach does an excellent job at getting the performances that he wants and is able to tell a good story.",Meet the Parents

And when the girl's dad, Robert de Niro, is an ex-CIA agent, the things can only get complicated.Robert de Niro is absolutely great, and after the funny Analyze This, he shows again that he can be a great comedian. Ben Stiller is the same really funny guy, playing a character with a name that needs no further explaining: Gaylord Focker.

De Niro's so-called self parody role wears a little thin, mostly composed of him gurning every now and then, and Ben Stiller repeats his useless tit act from Something About Mary and Flirting with Disaster, while the rest of the cast mostly dither around in the background (apart from ..Owen Wilson.. as Stiller's rival, his girl's ex, who tears up some scenery with a good over-the-top camp act), but basically it's situation and slapstick, with a fair old whack of toilet humour thrown in.

135,mattrochman,I dedicate my next bowel movement to this film,1,27 September 2007,"Well let's start off by saying that comedy cinema has been in troubling decline for about 10 years. It's all political correct, contrived, formulaic and worst of all, unfunny.In all my IMDb reviews, I have not rated one Ben Stiller film. All of them are pathetic (and guess what, there's something about mary was just as bad as the rest). Some fellow actors say he's so serious when he works and so many people think he's side-splitting. If you ask me, he is the most unfunny actor in the history of comedy and has a clear ability to pick the most pathetic scripts circling Hollywood.Him aside, this film is dreadful. It isn't funny and if you think it is, then I wonder what would happen if i put a flash light to your left ear. Would I see light coming out the right side? Let's look at some of the pathetic attempt at comedy used in this one. The character's surname is Focker. Gee that's funny (not). The screenwriters must have agonized for months before coming up with the idea of giving the main character a surname that they can milk about 1000 unfunny one-liners and jokes from. Then, after you think they milked that one for everything it's worth, a sequel emerges titled ""Meet the Fockers"", where the surname is giving rise to more material. Suffice to say that the sequel was worse than this, but I won't review it since I can't set the IMDb star rating into negative territory.Then they set up stupid and deeply contrived scenarios like Mr. Focker going through the brother's underwear draw. Gee, that one was funny and original..... NOT. After this, the writers obviously had to apply their intelligence as they must have realized that it was seriously lacking. So they ever so slightly raised the bar and tried to come up with the father-in-law from hell, even though that in itself is deeply clichéd. So they made him some sort of ex-CIA something or rather, with a lie detector in his basement so that the future son-in-law's sexual past can be probed.At this point, I actually felt embarrassed for Robert De Niro. Someone certainly must have called in a big favor to get him on-board this rubbish. Another pathetic protuberance along the downwardly-inclined road that is Hollywood comedy.And.... I've said it before so I'll say it again - I'm still waiting for a Ben Stiller film that I actually like.",Meet the Parents

138,gattonero975,"""A So-So Comedy""",8,27 September 2012,"The only reason I watched this film because it has starring one of my favorite actors of all times: De Niro. he wasn't the De Niro I'm use to seeing and expecting from other films. playing a retired CIA type, OK I guess and that's because I'm basing it on his past film work. I figured he could get away with it. Him playing Teri Polo's dad, don't think so. Didn't work for me. Blythe Danner did a way more believable job as her mom. They kinda look like each other also. Danner didn't have to much to do here, the whole film really revolves around De Niro vs Stiller.Ben did and still does a good job playing these geek-like/ white-bread types. I could not identify with him at all because I am more of an aggressive type and would never stoop so low as to impress my future father-in-law the way Ben does here. So the scenes where he is trying his best to impress DeNiro's uptight, conservative, anal-type ex-CIA guy just is not funny to me. It's annoying. I'm like if she loves me and I love her, then the hell with what anyone thinks, especially our parents.Teri polo did an excellent job as Ben's love. You can actually believe he is doing and taking all this BS for a girl like that. it's funny that she turns out not to be all that Ben thought she was. She was living a very care-free almost purely sexual relationship with Owen Wilson's character!! In which Ben knew nothing at all of it! she saved all explanation though by saying, she loves Ben and that she never ever really ""loved' Owen! Ka-Ching! Hooked! Owen Wilson did a good job also as the former love of Teri. Owen was just being Owen-Obnoxious, basically himself. He still carries a torch for Teri. (He still has all the pictures of he and her doing all kinds of adventures like :Sky-diving, skiing, bungee-jumping, etc..) All things Ben has not done with her yet! Yet he still stays because why? ....She loves him. Awww... Give me a break! Yeah right.Character actor James Rebhorn does very little here except basically be set background. He plays Teri's sister future father-in-law since his son is actually marrying Teri's sister.The cat scenes and the weird airport lady scenes which includes the on the plane scene which Adam Sandler also used for his Anger Management movie, in which Sandler has a similar scene, is almost a bit way funnier than anything else in the film. But if I wanted to watch cute pets, I could have easily seen any America's funniest video's. BUT ANYWAYS, The film was good enough to make a sequel. And in the end it's not half bad considering all the talent that really was involved. A first time pairing for some. now that's always a treat to any film-watcher.",Meet the Parents

As usual he has to prove he is the man to her father, who is not quite convinced of that. Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro both give great performances which takes just average comedy to the good level. There are many laugh out loud moments and also some silly gags here and there. I haven't seen much of Ben Stiller except in 'Night at the Museum' series, he really shines out here. The story is quite predictable but humor is there every now and then to keep you hooked.

142,tmpj,Hard to warm up to it.....,5,1 July 2010,"Frankly, I did not find the film to be very funny or entertaining. It seems that the measure of a film now-a-days is not how much it entertains, but how well it does at the box office. Some pretty lousy films have done well with ticket sales, while some other films have had something to say, but have fallen short of the dollar mark. This was an OK film, but not one that I would call a ""must see"" movie. And then, for it to spawn a sequel is beyond all belief. I tried to give the movie a fair watching--after all, I assumed that with De Niro on the screen there would be much there to watch--but I kept finding myself mouthing off the words of the kids in the back seat of the van ..."" are we there yet??"" De Niro has a broad spectrum, a big range for his acting talents. But he is an extraordinary actor who, it seems, falls flat on his face when he is not cast as an extraordinary character. It was awfully big of him to take the role of the father, but it felt more like casting Humphrey Bogart as an extra. And as for Ben Stiller...he still has a ways to go to establish a screen persona. His character was somewhat nebulous...though he did well at defining how vulnerable the character was. Comparing Stiller to De Niro, or even to his father, Jerry, is something of an unfair comparison, but he has yet to come up with that defining character or characteristic. The situations are stretched somewhat out of proportion, and Jay Roach's direction works far better with Mike Myers, where reckless abandon of plot and characters are the rule and not the exception. Based on what I saw in this film, I am in no hurry to see ""The Fockers"". I only recommend this film if you have nothing better to do.",Meet the Parents
143,MovieLuvaMatt,"No comedy classic, but definitely has its moments",7,13 October 2003,"I'm not going to appraise this movie in the same way most people have, but as a whole it is funny.  It has its flaws, but the laughs outweigh those flaws.  First of all, I have to give most of the credit to Robert DeNiro. Many compliment this movie because of Ben Stiller, but I feel DeNiro added more of the laughs.  His reactions to Stiller's foolish antics are what made me laugh the loudest.  It shows that comedy is best when you play it out seriously.  Certain gags, some of which the film is best known for, simply fall flat.  The dinner table scene where Stiller talks about milking a cat and DeNiro gets choked up reading a poem drags out and is badly paced.  In the volleyball scene, when Stiller spikes the ball on that girl's face, I wasn't laughing either.  I don't think I'm being a stickler when I say that you can't show someone bleeding and in pain in a gag and expect a laugh. But there are other gags that work with flying colors.  I liked the bomb-bomb-bomb joke, and many of the latter scenes when Stiller's at the airport and running into problems with dumb employees. 
All in all, it's an uneven comedy that's way too silly at times, but there are enough laughs for it to deserve a recommendation.  As I said before, much kudos to DeNiro for a priceless comic performance. 
My score:  7 (out of 10)",Meet the Parents
144,jimi99,pretty sad,3,18 November 2002,"This kind of lame-brained comedy that is so cherished by the mass market must fill some kind of masochistic social need, but I personally don't get it.  I loved and admired such dark comedies as ""After Hours,"" ""The Out of Towners"" and even ""Something About Mary,"" but they had something that this one lacked: intelligence and a sense of the unexpected.  This script seemed to be written around Stiller & DeNiro, a series of gags and sketches that add up to a big rollicking nothing.  This is very much in the ""Home Alone"" vein, written for adolescents who revel in unsubtle physical humor, much of it based in cruelty (S&M all the way) with a sickly sweet ending that was a foregone conclusion from the beginning.",Meet the Parents

146,xavrush89,Jay Roach has taken his Austin Powers cartoonism too far.,2,15 January 2005,"This is one of those films that was advertised so heavily, I felt like I'd seen it before I actually saw it. They used all the best gags in the ads (which isn't saying much) and the presence of De Niro dominated. Maybe it's just me, for I know this was a big hit, but I couldn't stand seeing a highly regarded actor like Robert De Niro mugging his way through this lowbrow flick like it were a 108-minute Saturday Night Live sketch--which is what it should have been. It is staggeringly annoying watching Ben Stiller endure thinly veiled threat after threat, and it's not even rewarding when he finally stands up for himself.Judging by this films box-office take, I guess I'm not in the majority when I say I am sick of the whole ""you're not good enough for my daughter"" schtick in movies and TV (the dreck known as ""8 Simple Rules"" is another example). However, I would like to thank IMDb for this website which allows me to vent my extreme displeasure at this totally unoriginal and irritating trend. I found this ""comedy"" utterly awful.P.S. If you agree with me, you might want to check out the Roach's previous film, Mystery Alaska.

I didn't like what other actors were maybe too calm but whole story was very well connected and so funny .Ben Stiller maybe confused but he played his role on high level . It was really enjoyable to watch him in this role . He always makes movie funny when he is doing something in which he isn't good . In this movie it is babysitting .DeNiro was also damn good because he was playing retired agent and he was doubting whole time . He is funny with his calm humor .

He attempts to fit in to the social circle of this traditional family, who has their own set of rules and specific ways of living that keeps him thinking on his toes and attempting to fake it till he makes it.Greg tries to make an impression with the overly protective father, Jack Byrnes, played by Robert De Niro, who has a clandestine past and is growing suspicious due to mix-ups that put Greg in a negative light for being the right man for his prized daughter. He has to drop a few habits and pick up new ones to keep up. If it could get any more worse the ex, Kevin, played by Owen Wilson, is on top of everything without evening trying, not to mention close to the father and on good terms with Greg's girlfriend. You could say he's got a lot on his plate, as he's the extreme of polite and can't say what's really on his mind out loud in order to save face in front of others.""Meet the Parents"" was fresh for its time and still holds up as a situational comedy with some relating points about meeting others for the first time or just trying to be one of the gang. It can make you cringe for the main character as he fumbles to do things right by these new people with hilarious trial and error. Just in time, some of the zany pile ups begin to get far-fetched but is saved by seeing Greg in the cross between imploding and running away from everything going wrong by his own hands. This is a Hollywood film, so some sentiment is going to be offered in order to give it that finishing touch. This was a well-done film as it steadily paced the timing of its jokes instead of trying too hard to completely shock the audience. That's what gives it its replay value to this day as the scenarios are memorable, not to mention identifiable if still exaggerated for comic relief.",Meet the Parents
153,Denver53,"Stupid characters, inexplicable actions, a few laughs",5,2 May 2001,"I'm one of those people who have to see a sort of logic in a movie character's behavior to fully enjoy any resulting comedy. If a character takes a wrong turn somewhere and tries to get back on course but in the process takes an even more wrong turn and fun ensues, that's fine. But if a character gets lost and instead of trying to turn back decides to set his pants on fire or run over someone sitting on a park bench for no apparent reason, that is not funny to me. That's why I rated Meet the Parents a 5.The main character, played by Ben Stiller, lies for no reason and then gets caught in his lies and makes them worse. He takes actions that he isn't supposed to and has been warned not to do then lies when he is asked if he did so and blames something (a cat) else. And when Greg tries to find the missing cat, he quickly stoops low enough to paint a different cat's tail and try to pass it off as the missing feline (why no one notices the paint smell until later that night, and then they do, is a mystery).  The guy isn't especially likeable and you keep wanting to slap him and say, ""Just tell the truth! It works!""Meanwhile, his girlfriend expects Ben (called ""Greg"" in the movie) to instantaneously act like he is a member of a family he has never met. When Greg needs clothes, his girlfriend tells him to wake up her brother -- whom Greg has never met and whose bedroom door is closed while the brother is apparently asleep -- and borrow some of his. Uh, not a good idea. Later, his girlfriend drops little bomblets on Greg, such as the fact that the best man at a family wedding is her ex-finacee (by the way, Greg never even knew that his girlfriend had been engaged), or that the dad had a different career than what she had told Greg earlier.All in all this group of characters spends a lot of time cleaning up messes that would have been easily avoided if a little truthful communication had taken place beforehand. It is that fact that kept me from enjoying any of the contrived situations that ensued. In fact, to me the funniest part of this movie was an airline gate agent who acts like, well, an airline gate agent, regardless of the actual situation around her. *That* was not contrived at all and was laugh out loud funny.",Meet the Parents

I thought Robert De Niro acted great in a surprising role that I did not think he was going to do good  in because he is good in so many different roles but he did this one greatly. I thought the story was excellent because there is so much you can do with this type of story. Meeting the parents is not an easy thing to do and a lot of things can go wrong during that visit.

159,snelling,There's Something About Mary Part II,5,5 October 2000,"Beware! In order to critique this film I may have to reveal some key plot points!! Turn back if you don't want me to spoil it for you!!! OK, you were warned... I had high hopes for this movie. The trailer looked quite fresh and amusing. The first act started out cute and light, establishing the characters quite nicely. Ben Stiller (Greg) plays basically the same mensch he played in 'Mary,' a likable schlub who only wants to marry his sweet, loving girlfriend and live happily ever after. But first he has to 'Meet the Parents.' Actually he has to meet her father, Jack, played by Robert DeNiro. Here he's basically playing the same jerk he played in 'This Boy's Life,' but now it's for laughs, I suppose. Me? I was squirming in my seat whenever Jack was on screen. He would make any possible suitor nervous. But how can you root for Greg, who is the main central character, when the script stacks the deck so clearly against him from the outset?From the moment he arrives with his soon-to-be-fiancée at her parents' house, every single thing goes wrong. He says the wrong thing at every instance. He inadvertently lies because he is so nervous. Things get broken (and of course they are irreplaceable) and the cat goes to the bathroom on the debris. The cat! This cat named Mr. Jinx should have had second billing right under DeNiro's name. Jack is so in love with this cat, he immediately dislikes Greg when it is revealed he is more of a 'dog person.' And who tells Jack that Greg hates cats? His girlfriend Pamela! Oops, but what are you gonna do? Of course, Mr. Jinks gets lost. But how can we believe that Greg would be so naive as to think he could pass off a lookalike cat to Jack, its owner of fifteen years? Especially when the cat knows a myriad of tricks that no other cat could possibly know? Suddenly Greg is an idiot! According to the plot, Jack can read people. This means he can spot a liar a mile away. How can a man like Jack be so suspicious of everyone around him and yet not know his own son sneaks out at night, presumably to buy pot? This wasn't even played for laughs. It's simply an inconsistency in the plot. Later a bong is found in Jack's son's coat pocket. But since Greg was wearing the coat at the time, Jack thinks it's Greg's. Ha ha, it never stops. There are so many marijuana references, it's no wonder this movie was directed by a guy named Jay Roach. Seemingly insignificant plot developments are scattered throughout the dialogue to come back and bite Greg on the butt later on in the story. More truths are revealed between Greg and Pamela that only come out when Greg is on the spot with her dad. For instance, Greg buys a special gift for Jack upon his first introduction to him. It is believed that Pamela helped him select this gift (It's a rare flower that will bloom in six months.) on the condition that Jack used to be a florist. After Greg embarrasses himself thinking that Jack would loooove this little reference to his past profession, it's revealed he was never a florist at all. But who reveals this? Pamela! Why would she set him up for a fall like that? Some girlfriend! The writers of this thing even give Greg a silly last name to add insult to injury. You'd think with a last name like Focker, that every kid Greg ever knew growing up would have mocked him so mercilessly, he would have changed it or gotten used to it by now. By the end of this movie I was p***ed off because I felt cheated. I got more agitated by everything that went wrong for poor Greg. I just wanted him to get back at Jack somehow; yell at him or something. But, no. What does this script make him do? He takes his anger out on a dopey flight attendant whose only crime was making him wait until his row was called before he boarded his plane the hell out of there. Some comeuppance.And the ending is from out of nowhere. Booooo! Liked the cat, though, and I'm not a 'cat person.' Take that, Jack.",Meet the Parents

He glowers, or makes sarcastic remarks to Stiller and is constantly hilarious. Stiller, have perfected the nervous guy routine in THERE' SOMETHING ABOUT MARY, brings this character to a new level.

The logline reads ""Male nurse Greg Focker meets his girlfriend's parents before proposing, but her suspicious father is every date's worst nightmare."" The main characters are Greg, our antagonist, his girlfriend Pam and her father Jack. Greg's main goal in this film is to win the approval of his girlfriend's father and then ask his her to marry him. What stands in Greg's way is Jack's automatic disapproval of him and a continuous strand of bad luck that hijacks his every move. Although Greg tries his best to keep a level head this back luck is only further instigated by Jack's disapproval. Although the movie is a comedy and I thought it fit into its genre quite well - it is not a movie that I found particularly ""moving"" mostly because I don't enjoy this style of movie.

164,shadow_blade-89459,Hilarious,8,28 November 2017,"""Meet the Parents"" (2000) is a professionally produced comical take on self-sabotage. The story is about a man, Greg Focker played by Ben Stiller, who sets out to gain approval to wed from the father of his girlfriend, Pam Byrnes played by Teri Polo. The father, Jack Byrnes played by Robert De Niro, pushes all the buttons to allow Greg to make himself appear as an unfit partner. This film is hilarious and filled with lessons to live by.By the end of the film, viewers will realize there is two stories in this film. The main being from the point of view of Gregg and the secondary is about Jack and his love of his first-born child, Pam. The film has moments of emotional impact, mostly sadness for Greg, but I feel it is more educational than emotional. The lesson is: be true to yourself and allow others to formulate their own opinion after seeing the real you. Overall, this is a great comedy.",Meet the Parents
165,maitreg,Some of it is funny,4,4 April 2001,"Some of this movie is very funny, but most of it is just plain cruel and doesn't deserve a chuckle.  Ben Stiller plays Greg, the soon-to-be fiance of Pam (Teri Polo), who's just meeting her parents for the first time.  Her parents, especially her father (Robert De Niro), not only reject him, they treat him like a piece of unwanted garbage.  Personally, I would have just walked out after the first five minutes with the parents and never would have seen her again.  I wouldn't WANT to marry into a family as arrogant as that.  But anyway, Greg spends an entire weekend with the in-laws where NOTHING goes right for him.  This is an obvious take on the the first sequence of ""There's Something About Mary"".  It's wasn't remotely funny in ""Mary"", and it doesn't work here either.  If you have the mentality of a 12 to 16-year-old, you may enjoy it.  But for the rest of us, it just tries too hard to be funny.  It doesn't flow very well, and most of the situations don't make a lot of sense.

Pam's neglect of Greg's feelings and most of all her blindness toward her father's obsessiveness demonstrates how we never see our own family the same way other people do. You know your family is weird--but just how weird is only found through throwing a stranger at its mercy.""Parents"" begins as an overprotective-father-versus-boyfriend story, moves toward the ridiculous, but always remains believable. After a while it becomes clear that the real problem between Greg and Jack (Robert DiNiro), Pam's dad, is simple: they just don't get along. We've all come across people we know we don't like from the moment we meet them. Greg's tough luck is that his father-in-law to-be is one of these people.""Meet The Parents"" is good because it gives each character enough of a life that each has something to learn. It's also got a lot of humanity at its core. Most everyone who sees this film will be able to relate to Greg's predicament. Most everyone will recall a time when they were in Greg's shoes--or they'll come to the shocking realization that they were torturing someone and didn't know it at the time.This is a rare story in which there really is one main character around which everything else revolves. Everything that happens is connected with Greg Focker (Ben Stiller plays it perfectly; he's never been funnier). There are no unnecessary subplots that enhance supporting characters. They don't even bother giving Pam her own life. All she is, from first frame to last, is Greg's girlfriend. Jack is Greg's girlfriend's dad and so on. This puts you inside the main character's world in a way few films do.While the writers show great control over their material by doing this, they fall short in other areas. Greg's last name, Focker, and the various ways people pronounce it, is a running gag that isn't nearly as funny as the film's creators seem to think it is. Whenever things start getting dull, they pull out the old Focker joke so at least the small-minded people in the audience can get a giggle. There are moments of agony, such as truck tires spraying sewage all over Pam's family, that are so gross you can't believe what you're watching. The goal is to set this lewdness against a backdrop of suburban normalness, which makes it funnier.Supposedly anyway. More times than not, though, it works. The film does what all good entertainment does: holds a warped mirror up to real life, so we can laugh at ourselves a little.Grade: C+",Meet the Parents

Soon, Greg's chances of receiving Jack's permission to wed his daughter become less and less probable as his bad luck only manages to increase.Outrageously funny, certainly you'd never expect DeNiro to be this funny.

Not only is the movie absolutely hilarious from start to finish, it also has a lot of sad and touching elements. Ben Stiller is great as the unfortunately named Greg Focker (who does resemble his character in There's Something About Mary a little too much) and Robert DeNiro is fantastic as Jack Byrnes, a would-be father-in-law from Hell. DeNiro is much better in this movie than his terrible role in the atrocious Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle simply because he is more relaxed and has much more fun with this character. Stiller and DeNiro make such a good team in this movie, also. Both of them make the perfect reactions to all the absolutely humiliating mishaps Greg does in the movie. All the horrible things Greg does, from losing DeNiro's dear cat to breaking a girl's nose to setting the house on fire, none of them would have been as funny as they were if DeNiro didn't do such a good job reacting to the accidents when he would find out about them. And some of the scenes (Greg saying grace at the dinner table and the fabulous interrogation scenes) are absolutely IMPOSSIBLE not to scream out laughing.And although the movie does have a little too much in common with There's Something About Mary, it still has all new laughs that are very fresh and are absolutely a riot!",Meet the Parents

In male nurse Gaylord ""Greg"" Focker's (Ben Stiller) unusual case, he has to gain the blessing of his girlfriend's ex-CIA father (Robert Deniro). To our delight and Greg's misery, a great blunder of events continually push him as far from acceptance as possible. This leaves Greg up creek without a paddle and forces him to realize that he cannot control other people's perception of him.The film is among the best comedies of the early 2000's. The story's pace alone sets the film apart from other comedies. There is never a dull moment or loss of speed. Meet the Parents is smart and engaging. The audience truly feels present in each of the hilarious scenarios. We imagine or remember a time we were in Greg's shoes. Critics often associate Ben Stiller with ""trash comedies"" that favor slapstick and gross humor over intelligent humor. Yet, Robert DeNiro's presence guides the movie along and helps qualify it as the best of its class.Ben Stiller's apparent cheap quality beautifully contrasts DeNiro's Oscar winning visage.

178,Sam_Gray,Best comedy in years,9,29 December 2000,"I like comedies as much as the next guy, but I think that comedy as a genre tends to produce mediocre films more often than any other genre, and even the best of comedies aren't as likely as other genres to produce a film worth more than one viewing.  It could be worse for comedy, though, as I think horror and action produce more outright bad movies than other genres.Anyway, I think the mediocre tendency in comedy has been even more prevalent then normal in the past few years, as most of the major comedies releases have been, well, average efforts in my opinion, and I'm speaking of films such as: There's Something About Mary, both the Austin Powers movies, and Analyze This.  You might notice I haven't included any of the ""teen"" comedies, but that's because I consider ""teen"" to be a genre onto itself. And, now that I think about it, ""teen"" is even worse than horror and action because it produces almost nothing other than terrible films, particularly if teen and horror combine without the word ""scream"" in the title.  Comedy's looking better all the time.But, alas, I digress.  The point of the matter is that, with Meet the Parents, I've finally found a comedy that beats this mediocre trend.  And, if you're anal about movie knowledge like I am, you're probably noticed that Meet the Parents includes, in its stars and director, people involved in each of the average films I mention above.  In fact, that bit of trivia had made me somewhat wary of seeing this film.Luckily for me, I crumbled.  Meet the Parents is not only funnier that any other strict comedy in years, but it is also smarter.  Part of my problem with a lot of comedies these days is the overuse of sight gags and toilet humor.  Not that I have a problem with either, but I feel like movies insult my intelligence when they use either too often.  Meet the Parents has its share of both, but most of the really funny stuff is verbal or situational. There's even an instance or two of choice satire near the film's end.What surprised my the most about Meet the Parents, however, is how many of the laughs come from De Niro.  He's definitely the straight man, but he's got some good lines.  He's also well cast, and he has essentially taken a lot of his more prominent roles and toned them down into an overprotective father.  At the same time, he's likeable, and that impresses me.  His is the best performance in the movie and also his best in years.True, Meet the Parents is a little over-the-top, but so what?  It's also highly entertaining, and the fact that I would willfully watch it again, knowing the jokes, says a lot for it in my book.  9/10",Meet the Parents

180,nEoFILM,Lies do not pay...,7,25 February 2011,"This awkward comedy of errors has gone on to spawn a whole franchise, with the latest installment, ""Meet The Parents: Little Fockers"" just wrapping up its run in theatres as I write. Ben Stiller is Gaylord (Greg) Focker, who is trying to impress his prospective father in law, Robert De Niro on top form, as he plans to propose to his daughter.The couple 'meet the parents' as they stay the weekend for his future sister in law's wedding and things obviously go down hill from there, with the inevitable comic effect. He meets the rest of her family and several friends, all of whom seem not to care a jot that Stiller's Focker is given little consideration.On top of all this, De Niro's father character is an Ex-CIA agent, which further compounds the problems, but when all is said and done, I find it hard to completely sympathise with Stiller's protagonist, as whilst some of the problems and situations are beyond his control, many of them are caused by his constant lying.The film seems to be a little confused as whether it supports Stiller as he lies his way through the film, to everyone, including his hosts, or De Niro who correctly points out towards the film's conclusion that things might have gone better if he had only told the truth.I personally agree with De Niro. The hero of this film is a liar and he pays for those lies, but that is turn makes it difficult for me to sympathise or empathise too much with him. Having said that, this is well-played cringe-worthy comedy, and it does a great job of conveying that sense and drawing us into the discomfort of the characters. Owen Wilson's lengthy cameo as the perfect, divine ex-fiancé was pitched perfectly, truly capturing the ideas that we have over matching up to the past, though over-played, on a metaphorical level, it was brilliant.Overall, it made me laugh throughout, but I wouldn't say that it was hysterical, though it was entertaining, moderately thoughtful but promotes a brand of humour that isn't what I would consider to be number one for me.",Meet the Parents

But if anyone knows about the intelligence community this could be any organization authorized to operate with U.S. intelligence data.From my point of view I like to think of the actor DeNiro using and wearing his yamaka in some film to express his hidden heritage as being Jewish. As in the movie Analyze That when DeNiro ties up customers in a diamond shop. So in this movie Meet The Parents I think DeNiro again is playing the the concept of religion with the Jewish Kabbalh and Hasidism. This religious concept has the religious concept written from my research that it is common to pass on the family secrets to a son-in-law.Of course throughout the movie Jack is cautious and skeptical, which is probably common for a retired intelligence agent with world culture. The acting is pretty good creating a relaxed environment for entertainment with good setups for the short exciting action sequences. Camera lighting and film quality are also top noch.",Meet the Parents
182,fiteclub!,"Awful, Awful",1,9 October 2000,"This film is an uneven mess.  It is funny for about 10-15 minutes at the beginning, and for maybe 45 seconds (possibly two minutes) at the end.  The rest of the film is a horrible monstrosity.After the initial, fifteen minutes (I'll be generous), the film suddenly falls in love with its gross-out comedy.  It began as a kinda strange, funny film about characters.  There's unspoken tension between Stiller and DeNiro, and it was very funny.  Then the film becomes a slapstick gross out mess of a film, and the jokes were seen miles away.  The tragedy is that even when they're being set up we already know they will not be funny, so when they are finally delivered, we completely hate them.At around the midpoint, you find the film too absurd to be taken seriously, and from there it only gets worse.  The characters are so uneven and poorly written that you don't even really care what they say or do. 
Things get more and more absurd and less and less funny as the film goes on and on (and on and on). Clueless Director Jay Roach clearly had a vision for this film, but it's a shame his crew didn't share the same vision.  It's obvious that no one knew what the hell they were doing in this atrocity besides the director.  And it's the irony of ironies that this happens to be one of the worst American directors working today.
This film is much, much worse than those Austin Powers films Roach directed, and I think that's saying quite a lot. In fact-
Wait, wait, what the hell am I doing writing this review?  Why am I still typing?  This film is awful-stay away!  It doesn't even deserve my time in writing a decent review.  If they didn't put that much effort into their film, why should I put that much effort into this?",Meet the Parents
183,Aphex97,A Modern Comedy Classic,8,30 May 2001,"Few films can make laugh out loud. This film had me rolling! Ben Stiller is hilarious. His mannerisms, his wit, and his timing are impeccable as he turns in another great comedic performance.  Stiller is Greg Fokker, a man in love. Fokker wants to ask his girl to marry him, but first he must get her father's permission. The film is about his trip to meet the parents...with hilarious results!The plot isn't new or original, but its presentation is very very good and very very funny. Stiller sets a new standard for screwup boyfriends everywhere. De Niro is perfect as intimidating and overprotective father. A great supporting cast. Great direction with almost flawless comedic timing make this one a true winner. FINAL RATING: 8/10 A modern comedic classic. Movie fans of all genres can find something to enjoy.

184,toclement,"""Meet the Parents"", I'd like you to meet the rubbish bin",2,6 January 2001,"I went into ""Meet the Parents"" with an open mind, in the mood to see a lighthearted but somewhat intelligent comedy.  Considering the two stars (DeNiro & Stiller), I thought I had a good shot at getting what I was looking for.  Unfortunately I was sorely disappointed; ""Meet the Parents"" is nothing more than a 2-hour cliche, with a horrible script full of more holes than Swiss cheese.  For example, Stiller's character name was Gaylord Focker.  So everyone in the film keeps addressing him ""Hey Focker!""  That's not funny, that's sophomoric!  Once would have been okay, but from beginning to end?  Focker is a male nurse, which makes him an endless target for being less than a whole man.  Isn't that fodder for an after-school special from the 1970s? 
But the thing that destroys this film is the horrible plot.  I guess we're supposed to recognize that DeNiro's character (the father of Focker's girlfriend) is kind of a psycho, but at the same time, Focker is exactly what the overprotective Dad claims: a habitual liar.  Then, after Focker has wreaked all kinds of havoc on his future hopeful in-laws DeNiro does an about face and realizes that Focker is the right guy for his daughter, as long as he loves her.  What the hell??  You just spent two hours developing a character and then in two minutes you tear it down...  I know that it's written in the U. S. Constitution that all films must have happy endings, but you could have found a more plausible way to arrive at that legally binding conclusion.  The movie makes absolutely no sense.  So Focker didn't lie about his MCAT scores, he lied about everything else.  But the MCAT score is the thing that saves him?  Why is an MCAT score from 10 years ago more important than the dozens of disasters he has caused?I know it's just a comedy, but where is it written that comedies don't need to be written and filmed in a logical and intelligent way?   If you want to see a GOOD dark comedy about a bad luck streak, check out ""After Hours"" or ""The Out of Towners"" (the 1970 original).  Leave ""Meet the Parents"" for another lifetime (I know it's too late, you have all already seen it).",Meet the Parents

Al Pacino and Mel Gibson are doing the same things also.  I'm never watching their movies again.  Don't rent this title because although it might be fun to watch, it's not worth two hours of watching. The characters aren't developed and the storyline's dumb.  The acting is also ridiculous.

I especially laughed at the sister being bopped in the eye with the volleyball scene.  But wait a minute, are there any big yocks that aren't in the trailer?  Answer:  Very few.That said, let me say that I think that this is pleasant movie well worth seeing.  Waiting for it to come out in video may not be a bad idea, though. ""Meet the Parents"" is a good old-fashioned American comedy in the mode of ""Father of the Bride"" and many of the other movies of the '50's with Spencer Tracy, Jimmy Stewart, etc.  That is, good clean fun with the emphasis on family and an ending that you know is going to be happy.  Excellent performances from all, but especially DeNiro and Stiller and special mention must go to the unique acting ability of Mr Jinx.All in all, a great movie to see with your family....the kids and Grandma, too...I think they'll all have smiles on their faces at the end even if they're not rolling on the floor.",Meet the Parents
188,Lunchbox-8,"One of, if not, the funniest movies of 2000!",9,23 January 2001,"""Meet the Parents"" was a hilarious movie.  One of the reasons is because it was well casted.  Ben Stiller, everything bad happens to him, he's intimidated and insulted constantly: is that not what you think of when you think of Ben Stiller, in movies like ""There's Something About Mary.""  Robert Deniro, mysterious, seemingly conniving, an over-all sense of intimidation and violence: is that also not what you think of when you hear his name.    If you like movies where bad things constantly happen to someone, like in ""The Big Lebowski,"" you'll like this movie.  This movie is full of great scenes as well as great lines.  Greg Focker has to be the most unlucky character in movie history.  All this bad stuff happens to him although he's completely innocent.  And the movies not just a bunch of situations with bad stuff happening to Ben Stiller, it has a good ending that ties together the whole movie and makes all the bad stuff worth while.    This is a great date movie if you're sick of all that genuine romance stuff!  Enjoy!",Meet the Parents

Ben Stiller portrays Greg Focker the lovable all to easy target of Jack Byrnes a former CIA agent played by Robert DeNiro. The cast of characters are more fun than you can ever imagine.

192,alafolle,Just a good old-fashioned comedy,8,4 January 2001,"Once upon a time, comedy writers sought to create humor through plot and character development, rather than merely packing the script with crude sight gags and one-liners.  ""Meet the Parents"" is a long-overdue renaissance of this lost art form.  While most modern comedy films are all punch lines and no joke, this one earns its laughs the old-fashioned way--building comedic situations and using its one-liners as mere icing on the cake.  As a result, ""Meet the Parents"" bears more resemblance to ""Some Like it Hot"" than it does to ""There's Something About Mary"".Having recently been married myself, (inheriting a stern set of in-laws) I found myself identifying strongly with the ill-fated Ben Stiller character. The increasingly complicated situations in which he becomes ensnared were physically stressful to watch.  The father (Robert DeNiro) is demanding and intrusive.  The girlfriend (Teri Polo) is too self-absorbed to notice how badly things are going.  The hapless suitor makes increasingly boneheaded decisions in a desperate effort to curry favor.  We've all been there.  We see ourselves in the characters, and we're forced to laugh at the sheer absurdity of it all. The acting is solid, the script is as tightly wound as a good episode of ""Seinfeld"", and the laughs are abundant.  You can't ask much more than that from a comedy.",Meet the Parents

If only Ben could talk his father (Jerry Stiller) into signing up for it, that would be a heck of a good time. This movie is not rocket science and I think some critics have dogged it as a result.

A great script, superb cast and very solid direction from Jay Roach (director of Austin Powers 1 & 2) are all redeeming factors. Ben Stiller stars as Greg Focker (what a surname) who has plans to marry his beautiful girlfriend Pam, played by Teri Polo. However once he's met the parents (Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner) he begins to have second thoughts. Full of comedy moments and sharp one-liners, Meet The Parents is by far the best comedy of 2000, because it does not need gross-out moments to provide laughs, whereas flicks like Road Trip and Scary Movie do.

He manages to play Jack with that evil glint that de Niro fans are all too aware of.  Ben Stiller also does well as the nervous soon to be son-in-law and Blythe Danner's Dina (the mother) is played with an almost Marilyn Munroe daffy blonde with biting insights to situations.The film itself doesn't really go anywhere, gets ridiculously silly in parts and the ending is inevitable.

199,morticia64,What we fear will happen to us happens to Greg...,10,3 November 2021,"I believe this movie is successful because it's about something we can all relate to: meeting the families of our fiances. We are either the fiance, nervous to meet the future in-laws, or we are the in-laws who don't believe there's anyone good enough for our little boy or little girl. So most of us can identify with the story.For those who feel that the family was too hard on Greg, this is a creative film that has fun with the ""what ifs"" and potential for things to go wrong: from sharing a meal and making conversation with strangers to sleeping in a strange house, etc. The writers embellish those fears and exaggerate them. That's what makes it funny. The movie brings to life the things we fear the most, but never happen to us. We see them happen to Greg, and we as viewers can see that our worst fears are probably not going to happen. It's a lighthearted way for us come to terms that some things aren't as bad as we imagine them to be. It wasn't meant to be taken seriously, so enjoy the movie with this in mind.The film has a great cast of quirky characters and everyone does an outstanding job. It flows easily and there are a lot of laughs. Especially funny are the dinner scene, the water polo scene, the scene where the gazebo was put in the back yard for the wedding, and any scene with Jinx the cat.You just know that Greg will win over the parents and all will be well. It's a feel good movie at the end and we sure need more of those these days. Watch it as a lighthearted comedy and you will enjoy it. I highly recommend this film.",Meet the Parents
200,toadwriter,"Upon further review, not that funny",4,13 August 2020,"I like comedies so don't call me scrooge, but I've had a change of heart about Meet the Parents. I really feel a movie that can be seen over and over without getting sick of it is a sign of really great writing. I've seen comedies like Caddyshack, Fast Times, Beetlejuice, The Mask, Stripes (and others) so many times that I can pretty much recite the lines in verbatim. I still laugh after seeing them 100 times. But I recently changed the channel while watching Meet the Parents. I used to think it was original, funny, and a movie I could watch over and over, but it's not.The movie centers around Ben Stiller and he's not funny in this film. Watch him, listen to his lines, and the way he delivers them. That scene in the car about Puff the Magic Dragon was hard to watch him tripping over his tongue. Then the whole denying that he hates cats thing. Not funny. The funniest part of Ben Stiller is the end when he's talking to the camera, but the real funny aspect to that is that Robert DeNiro's watching.In fact, while some of DeNiro's humor is contrived, he's funny, Stiller's not. If it weren't for DeNiro, this would be complete trash.Overall I think there's some originality, the story is good, but there's too many actors that can't deliver a line, too much that's unrealistic, and too much unfunny.",Meet the Parents
201,leandros,Ben Stiller in trouble again...,6,23 January 2001,"A comedy, not brighter than a sitcom, starring Ben Stiller and Robert deNiro. Not many things to comment on, except that the script seems like written by a team again, because there are tiny bits missing I believe.
Well Ben Stiller is again in trouble, except that he has no ""hair gel"" to meddle with, instead the father of his fiancee, who is almost paranoidly obsessed with his daughter, and the family cat. Not a bit of improvement on acting skills in Stiller's compartment, De Niro is the same, shining and leaving the audience in sheer curiosity: why does he act in these ludicrous movies? If there are no movies to go and see other than this, OK; but if you have time and an alternative to ""Meet The Parents"", just wait until they release it on tape, rent it, just laugh through it, and forget about it in an hour.",Meet the Parents
202,deadkerouac,Amusing...somewhat,7,6 April 2002,"Ben Stiller stars in director Jay Roach's MEET THE PARENTS, a somewhat amusing farce about a male nurse named (yes) Greg Focker, who travels with his girlfriend Pam (Teri Polo) to her family home, not only because of Pam's sister's impending nuptials, but also because it will give Greg a chance to meet her parents and ask her father for Pam's hand in marriage. Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner, an onscreen couple you thought you'd never see, are absolutely believable as Pam's folks, especially in their first scene with the younger couple. Unfortunately, this is perhaps the film that has made De Niro into a comedic rather than dramatic actor (THE KING OF COMEDY wasn't meant to be completely amusing), and you'll begin to miss the Bobby of old (TAXI DRIVER, GOODFELLAS, even the action-packed RONIN).I'll admit that I enjoyed this film, but only in a few scenes. Greg's scene with the female ticket agent on the airplane was memorable, as were the scenes where Jack (De Niro), apparently ex-CIA, hooks Greg up to the lie detector, and where Greg does too much to impress the others during a game of water volleyball.What I did love about the film were its subtle touches, especially in the way Greg is treated, because it's happened to me--it's happened to a lot of us. Ever say something that causes other people to look at you and go, ""What the heck are you talking about?"" It's happened to me several times, and it happens to Greg. A lot. That's where the amusement in MEET THE PARENTS lies, and I hope that MEET THE FOCKERS, a sequel due out next year, keeps some of that. 7/10Side issue: the film is apparently based on an earlier (independent) film by screenwriters Greg Glienna and Mary Ruth Clarke. I just hope this film (the 2000 version) wasn't made just to make more $$$ on an older, funnier film. It'd sound too much like a remake that way.

This comedy was hilarious and I enjoyed watching the relationship between Robert DeNiro and Ben Stiller on the screen. One of the things I liked most about this movie was that it stayed focused on the plot. It didn't go off in different directions and it maintained a sense of reality that a lot of comedies lack. At the same time, it was funny from beginning to end. I'd have to say that another thing that makes this movie work well is that the relationship between Gaylord (Greg) and Pam is already in progress from the start of the movie so the viewer is immediately able to get to know the two of them and the relationship they have with each other.

I thought it had some funny moments, but many others were just so-so.  The full house audience in the theatre I was in didn't laugh as much as I did, so I figure it didn't go over really well with them either.The Movie might be more funny if I had never seen another one, but I have. So when a movie beats you to a bloody pulp with the jokes before they even happen, it loses the laugh.  The dialogue in place was good, but I just kept knowing that certain things were going to happen.EXAMPLES: ( SPOILERS )  We know from the moment they get there that the CAT is going to be a MAJOR joke prop.  What is it with Ben Stiller and evil animals?  I KNEW from the moment the urn was mentioned it would be broken, I KNEW the cat would not use the toilet the whole movie.  I KNEW Ben Stiller would end up on the roof smoking.  I KNEW it would probably result in something bad happening.  I KNEW the stupid wooden alter would end up defamed in some way.  I could go on all day.  These things were set-up with such bluntness that Helen Keller could see the sight gags coming.While I did laugh at some points, overall I was really disappointed.  The only way to make something funny is to catch the audience off guard with a new twist.  There were none in this film.P.S. Deniro is VERY Funny.  Maybe one of the top five comedians in Hollywood.

After ""Analyze This"", De Niro once again proves that he can play a funny character as well as mafia. Ben Stiller's character was similar to ""There's something about Mary"", goofy but likable.

However, since all the comic scenes were so heavily foreshadowed, you knew what was going to happen before you got there anyway, and the effect was ruined.

Terri Polo, Blythe Danner, and James Rebhorn are solid in supporting roles, but it is Owen Wilson that really shines.  Keep an eye on him--because he will be a star.

The movie was well-produced, well-paced, and well-acted, so I'm not faulting it on its technical merits. It's all perspective, and I know that. Some fool on here said the thing was all about power and control and anti- Semitism among WASPS, which simply doesn't scan at all to me and seems to indicate that some people really want to see things how they always see them anyway. The problem that I have with the movie is that pretty much the entire thing revolves around 'embarrassment humor'. Quite simply, I empathized with Greg's character enough that I didn't like watching him get beat on for nearly two hours, watching him make things worse for himself by being both stupid and pathetic, and then have a five minute resolution at the end that makes it all 'worth it'. It's just not funny to me. Rather, it's about the last thing I want to subject myself to, especially in the guise of a comedy. Some people enjoy this kind of thing, I guess because they're glad it isn't them or can think back to a time it WAS them and be glad it's over. Don't get me wrong, there needs to be some tension in any film and the risk of embarrassment works very well, even for me, in moderate doses. But this wasn't moderate. Watching 'The Passion of the Christ' is less painful for me, because as I see it, physical pain happens. This kind of social pain is more unjust.Good scenes? The cat milking discussion was hilarious. The lie detector scene was fun. The resolution at the end was far from adequate, but still a good scene. DeNiro is a far better comic actor than he's given credit for, and Stiller has made much of his career by being victimized by various forces on screen, so of course he does it well.

212,critical-escapist,Pure entertainment - what movies are made for,8,12 July 2005,"(very, very minor spoilers)I am usually the type who doesn't enjoy ""this sort"" of comedy. Name my least favorite movies and at least three of them include Ben Stiller. I've never been a huge fan of Ben Stiller for some reason. It wasn't that he was a bad actor, it was just his choices in roles. I just wasn't a fan of his. Period. But I do like Robert De Niro. I think he's a spectacular actor. One day Meet the Parents popped up on television and I decided to watch it. To much of my surprise, this film was really good.Ben Stiller stars as Greg Focker (Ben Stiller), a male nurse. Before he asks Pam (Teri Polo) to marry him, he would ask for her father's approval. The father, Jack (Robert De Niro) is sort of this suspicious and overprotective father that just wants ""the best"" for his daughter. He would give disapproving glances at Greg, which causes Greg to have numbers of flops and seem to be nervous ... all the time, which causes Jack to hate Greg more and more. We then find out Jack is a former CIA agent that has been to different countries and has a lie detector in his ""private office"" downstairs.Comedies are pretty predictable. Especially recent ones. We know about 100% that Greg and Jack are going to be happy in the end, approve of each other, and not try to kill each other. And that is what happens. What I liked about this movie is that it's not predictable-predictable, it's more like - you just enjoy it. You have a mindless head on top of you and you just want pure entertainment. Not some serious dialogue with Oscar-worthy performances, but just have a good time like what movies are made for. There are a few hilarious scenes between Stiller and De Niro. They just seem to be having fun, which is a good thing because it's always nice to watch actors have fun on screen. Stiller seems happy that he gets to work with De Niro and De Niro seems happy that he is in a light comedy and doesn't really need to put a single effort in it because he is almost considered ""legendary"" in modern Hollywood.So, it's worth your time. I saw this film two times and I won't be afraid to make it three. It's totally harmless. You're not going to really think about this movie after you seen it, but you're satisfied because you like it. It has very, very funny dialogue between characters and nice physical comedy. Ben Stiller is probably not a bad actor after all - just needs some motivation. And Robert De Niro steals almost every single scene in the movie. They're a good duo. Very, very enjoyable to watch. Watch this film when you just need a light-hearted comedy that doesn't require great use of intelligence.",Meet the Parents
213,jacob.rosen,Fits-and-Starts,5,2 November 2000,"The shock value Farrelly Brothers filmmaking that spawned ""There's Something About Mary"" is in abundance here, even going so far as to have Ben Stiller essentially reprise his role as a put-upon nebbish who can never seem to catch a break and winds up in the middle of disasters. ""There's Something About Mary"" was funny in spots but when it hit, it hit: the gags were so outrageous they compensated for the slow spots. ""Meet The Parents"" has the same fits-and-starts rhythm but the gags are merely pleasant and don't make up for the dead air that comprises most of the film. Stiller is an entertaining performer but he's beginning to typecast himself and is beginning to wear thin. Robert DeNiro, as the former CIA man whose daughter Stiller intends to wed, is enjoyable but he never manages to convey his intensity to the audience so they never feel completely, deliciously enthralled by him. Jay Roach directed, in a style typically subservient to Hollywood dictates. Not recommended.",Meet the Parents

I honestly laughed more and harder during the trailer for ""Emperor's New Groove"".The only fun or interesting characters were DeNiro, Blythe Danner and Ben Stiller.  Almost everyone else was a major irritation.  Especially, Teri Polo's character, Pam.  She turned me off from the second she took the cell phone call over the guy on his knee saying he loved her.There were so many long, painful periods between the few laughs, I felt in agony.Anyway, if you insist on seeing this, I recommend waiting til it's in the bargain area of the video store.",Meet the Parents

I thought it was clever, funny and romantic, but due to the overheard comment he backs down on this planned event. His intelligence went down from there. The gags are all predictable as were the characters. De Niro & Danner give solid performances. What is it with Stiller and animals?

218,kstice-25195,Hard to sympathize with Greg Focker,5,30 August 2021,"Meet the Parents will make you laugh, however, there are many jokes that are either unfunny or cringeworthy. Much of the film's comedic value is due to Robert De Niro, who really steals the show. Most of the movie's cringe factor comes from the fact that Ben Stiller's character is hard to like. Many of the situations in the film are easily avoidable for anyone even remotely normal. For this reason, I do not find Meet the Parents to be as good as other Ben Stiller comedies such as Tropic Thunder, Zoolander, Night at the Museum, or Dodgeball. Meet the Parents still has funny moments and a sweet story that make it worth a single viewing, but there are enough significant flaws in the movie that prevent me from truly liking it. 5/10Pros and Cons Summary+Robert De Niro+A fair number of funny moments+Sweet ending-Many characters are irritating or unlikeable-Some situations in the film are absurd and ridiculous-People shouldn't be encouraged to get married to people they've known for less than a year.",Meet the Parents
219,kdladage,Who watches this crap?,2,7 June 2005,"This is one of the most unfunny comedies I have ever seen. Each scene in the film appears tailor made to dig the main character (played by Ben Stiller) into a deeper and deeper hole that anyone with two functioning brain cells can see coming a mile away.Ben Stiller can act. I have seen it. I have seen him handle very funny roles, and even dramatic ones with skill and flair. He appears to be asleep through most of this film, just saying his lines when it is time to say them, without real emotion or concern for how bad this film really is.Robert DeNiro can act. Most people have seen that. He is one of the greatest actors ever. But his most recent roles have been... well... less than wonderful. He needs a new agent -- today -- before his legacy is destroyed.The film has a decent premise -- we have all had that awkward moment when we need to meet the parents of our significant other.

Gaylord, better known as Greg, is madly in love with his girlfriend Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo) and wants to marry her.  But before he can win her hand in marriage, he has to win her parents approval; a task which proves to be extremely difficult.Greg and Pam go on their way to meet the parents.  Greg doesn't exactly get off to a very good start when he manages to break the urn that holds the remains of a late relative.  Pam's father Jack (Robert Di Niro) takes an instant dislike to Greg and makes it his business to push Greg to the limit and see just how far he can go to get him as far away from his daughter as possible.The film is full of exceptionally funny moments.  The unfortunate events that unfold and the stupid ways in which Greg tries to cover them up, make this film worth a shot.  Granted, it's not the funniest film out there but it is very good for a laugh and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it.Robert Di Niro proves that he is still one of the most talented actors around, taking on the role of the control freak father and Ben Stiller settles in nicely to yet another role as the geek, trying to win his girl (Something About Mary).",Meet the Parents

Ben Stiller is given pointless and stupid stuff throughout the movie and really makes no connection with Teri Polo, Owen Wilson would go much better with her. The usual drug references and literal potty humor are uninspired, it's as if the writers gathered around some inane sitcom scripts and padded them with this stuff that wouldn't be allowed on TV. A really weak effort, but at least it's better than the sequel, which manages to misuse Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand.

227,chrismulkeyisgod,Not something most can relate to,3,30 December 2006,"I found this movie in a VCR player and decided to watch it because I am a huge Owen Wilson Fan (as my name clearly implies).I was a little disappointed by the main premise of the movie--I was expecting something a little more realistic (the VHS tape, after all, had originally been from Blockbuster video...or possibly Hollywood, I don't remember because I loaned it to someone I met on the internet so cannot check now to see but I'm pretty sure it was Blockbuster. It could have been from Hollywood though. Like I said, I don't remember so please don't IM me about this information).For starters, why would anyone need to meet someone else's parents when they have parent's of their own (that they do not need to meet, unless they were abandoned as children and left either at an orphanage or for dead on the harsh, realistic streets of New York City. Even then, I really don't see the point of meeting the parent's who never loved you). What made this idea even more improbable, was the idea that there was a great deal of distance to travel for that meeting to occur...I'm not sure what Owen Wilson was thinking when he accepted this part. What I do know is that I have never met anyone else's parents other than my own (my parents loved me very much and did not abandon me in New York City). And I'm glad too, because from what this movie portrays, other people's parent's are very mean and would probably judge me off of my character.If you're looking for a realistic film about social situations I would much rather you watched Saving Private Ryan.

229,alangalpert,Extraordinarily funny!!,9,30 April 2010,"""Meet the Parents"" is undoubtedly one of the funniest movies ever made. Someone once said that ""only the truth is funny"", and that certainly applies here. Every young man who is going to meet his girlfriend's parents for the first time is filled with trepidation, and has the feeling that he is about to be subjected to an Inquisition. This film takes that impression one step further, making literal what is ordinarily only figurative. In this case, the hapless suitor (Greg Focker, played by Ben Stiller) is to be probed and dissected by an ex-CIA man, who has years of experience and all the tools of the trade at his disposal, including contacts at the Agency. To say that Jack Byrnes (Robert de Niro) is an overprotective father is like saying that Krakatoa was an explosion. Unlike her husband, Dina Byrnes is generally supportive of Greg and sympathetic to his plight, but Jack is calling the shots. Greg strives gamely to win them over, but everything he does backfires, or at least fizzles.I have only one minor criticism. The lie detector idea was brilliant, but it could have been used to better effect. After the earlier scene when Greg is questioned about his feelings toward cats, the polygraph gave Jack the perfect opportunity to find out the truth, but he doesn't ask Greg about it.There was an earlier, much shorter version of ""Meet the Parents"" that came out in 1992. It had basically an unknown cast, and very few people saw it. The lie detector bit from the 2000 film was the inspiration for a television reality show called ""Meet My Folks"", which ran on NBC for all of one full season. In contrast to the film, it was not primarily funny, although many viewers found it so.",Meet the Parents

It is not a comedy; it is a tragedy: Not one of the main characters has a sense of comedy.  In addition, the jokes are contrived and the dialogue is embarrassingly poor.Robert De Niro is not a comedian.  He plays violent parts, e.g., Goodfellas, Godfather, Cape Fear, etc.  If De Niro's next meal depended on making people laugh he would die of starvation.  So why was he cast in a main role?  The answer is simple: De Niro is one of the producers!  (Always look for the role that 'filthy lucre"" plays in a movie.)Ben Stiller has ambitions to be a comedian.  Sorry, Ben, your talent lies elsewhere.  This movie is a continuation of another mediocre performance that Stiller gave in the comedy ""Keeping the Faith"".  Ben, try drama; comedies are not for you.The only bright moment in the whole movie was the actress Kali Rocha who appeared as a flight attendant for a few minutes towards the end of the movie.  I hope she gets another opportunity to act in a comedy.  She seems to have that special gift of comic timing but her role was too short to tell for sure.

It had me laughing all the way, from beginning, the hospital ""practice marriage"" all the way to the end! This story directed By Jay Roach (Who directed Austin powers 1 & 2) is original and hilarious. It revolves around Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) who wants to marry Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo). To make Pam fall in love with Greg was easy. Before Greg could propose, he figures he needs to get the parents' approval. So he goes to Pam's parents' house in long island. I know it's Long island because a certain scene was filmed in Manhasset.Greg tries to impress Pam's father (Robert DeNiro)and mother (Blythe Danner),but each step he tries to make,is one bad step he messes up. Then, Greg finds out he can't be with his future wife. He must sleep in the basement. He finds out Pam's father, jack Byrnes, is with the CIA, resulting in a very great game of.. Lie Detector. That's basically the plot, I don't want to spoil it for you.DeNiro gives a great as protective father with a cat,Ben Stiller in his best role ever, so far. Blythe Danner is marvelous, reminding me of Sissy Spacek from ""Blast From The past"".DeNiro and Stiller have the funniest roles, and always give a good hearty laugh. I have never heard an audience laugh this hard. I watched the movie 5 times and I can't get enough of it! The audience roared with laughter at Stiller's funny antics, and DeNiro's comeback to shine.This movie is pure genius. Even better than Happy Gilmore. I can't help but laugh.

237,WHCernan,Why I can't watch Gomer Pyle,4,27 November 2000,"First things first: I WANTED to see this film. I think Ben Stiller is a hoot and De Niro is an excellent actor who is perfect for this material. De Niro did not disappoint and Stiller was exactly right for his role. Everyone was well-cast.So, then, why did this movie stink?I'll start by saying, I can't watch ""Gomer Pyle, USMC"". It's not that I don't like Jim Nabors; it's just that the show is about how Gomer always does things that are painfully and blatantly obviously STUPID and WRONG. Gomer asks out Sgt. Carter's girlfriend because the Sarge has to work in town and Gomer doesn't want her to feel lonely; then Sarge sees Gomer and goes on the rampage. Well, DUH. Nobody would do anything so stupid unless they really wanted to pursue the girlfriend. It's painful because I see it coming a mile away.Ben Stiller plays the Gomer Pyle role in this film. DeNiro is superb as the suspicious and unapproachable father in the Sergeant Carter mold. Stiller's character does so many things that are so STUPID and WRONG that you wonder how he could have survived to adulthood. I don't want to give anything away, but you and I and everyone else in the world knows that you don't try to ""replace"" a highly trained animal with one you found at the pound! Well, DUH! You see everything in this movie coming - a mile away.At least Gomer Pyle was only a half hour long. I kept wanting to get up and leave but several members of my family were along and I couldn't very well leave them there. At least I was treated, at the very end of the film, to a fantastically hilarious airline subplot that really made my wait mostly worthwhile.

239,Megabuck,"Good idea, shame about the movie",5,7 October 2004,"On the inside of Meet the Parents is a great plot idea, struggling to get out. Actually, that's not strictly true - the plot is actually realized pretty well; it's the supposed timing and unrelenting nature of the events that, for me, make this film no better than mediocre.The premise is simple: About to propose to Pam (Teri Polo), his girlfriend, Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) realises he's expected to ask her father's permission first. Of course, Jack (Robert de Niro) turns out to be every suitor's worst nightmare: demanding, condescending, belittling. Worse, it seems Greg can do nothing right.The bulk of the film documents everything that happens over a weekend at the parental home. Pam's sister is getting married, so it's a big get-together with family and friends. The battering starts immediately; Greg's luggage goes missing. Jack makes snide comments over the colour of his rental car and choice in pets. Greg even causes chaos when opening a bottle of wine.He is mocked for his choice of career - he's a nurse. Guess what: half the guests are doctors. He's intimidated by Pam's previous boyfriend, the seemingly perfect Kevin (Owen Wilson). His surname makes him an easy target. He manages to lose the family's pet cat, so he buys a replacement which looks nearly identical - which promptly tears the wedding dress to shreds. His luggage turns up, and Jack searches it, finding a pile of women's clothes - because, of course, it's not his bag.It transpires that Jack is a former CIA agent - except Greg becomes convinced he's still involved in some covert operation. So he blurts out what he knows - and, wouldn't you just know it, he's put his foot in it again.Taken individually, each incident is at least passably funny; some are hilarious; some make you cringe on Greg's behalf. But it's the whole thing - the relentless progression from one minor disaster to the next - where I felt the movie fell down. At first, it's pretty funny, watching this guy make a complete fool of himself; but when it goes on and on, and you realize you're in for an hour where nothing, NOTHING goes right, it just gets depressingly tedious.And it's not all perfect. The surname gag grew old fairly quickly; the way people addressed him using only his surname was downright rude rather than funny; one leaking toilet would NOT flood a yard, no matter how full the septic tank (and what kind of planning is it to hold a big wedding party with the tank ready to blow?) The happy ending was also pretty unconvincing.I haven't really said anything about the performances. I felt everyone did a reasonable job, nobody excelled. de Niro *can* do comedy - Brazil, Midnight Run - but here, I thought he was too deadpan, and the role just a bit *too* psycho. Stiller was a good choice for the lead, and Owen Wilson is great as the all-too-perfect ex. But, as I said, it's the pacing that spoils things. If they had spread the pain out a little - shown meetings over several weekends - along with scaling it back a little, I'd have enjoyed it a lot more.",Meet the Parents

Particularly because they don't resort to the gross-out stuff that virtually every other comedy contains these days. De Niro is the best thing about this film....I think he has great comedic timing. It's definitely a part of my DVD collection.",Meet the Parents

Greg is a guy who desperately wants to ask his girlfriend to marry him, but first her parents (especially her dad) have to approve of him. Starting with his luggage (and the engagement ring...) getting lost in-flight, Greg starts on a bad-luck streak that'll last the entire weekend.Although, having a cat named ""jinx"" around doesn't seem to help either.The bad-luck part gets a bit predictable towards the middle of the movie and in my opinion they start to overdo this quite a bit. Towards the end the movie does take a turn for the better, although the end is not very surprising. It is the way the cliche-ending is handled that is especially funny.Good movie to see. DeNiro is, of course, the best and plays the part of the somewhat grumpy father-in-law down very well.",Meet the Parents

Unless of course you like watching small spineless creatures being tortured.  I am talking about Ben Stiller here in case you missed it.  The last 15 minutes of this movie is nothing like the first 90, it moves along, there are some laughs, it just doesn't suck.  The same can't be said for what comes before it.  Stiller is a looser.  A male nurse you just can't like.  There is nothing redeeming about this character, he's sneaky, he lies, he doesn't seem to know anything about respect, he tries to manipulate those around him, he is just a horrible, unlike able person.  And he is the 'hero'.  At the end he grows a spine (as you would expect from a typical Hollywood formula) and over comes, conquers, changes and we all love him, blah, blah, blah.Save some money, see something else, wait for this to come out on TV (shouldn't be long), at least the commercials might keep things interesting.",Meet the Parents

I saw it at the movies twice and both times, I laughed equally hard at the sight gags and script. I'm sure any one would agree.  Director Jay Roach really made this movie extraordinary.  It rises above todays standards of what a good movie is. Oh, also, everything had something to do with the plot of the story.  If there was a joke about ""Puff the Magic Dragon"", then there was a good reason for it to be mixed into the dialouge.  Please see Meet the Parents more than once.  De Niro is classic, Stiller plays his character perfectly and all the others are great too.  So, go ahead, take a group, that's really fun.  Meet the Parents is one of the funniest movies of the year.",Meet the Parents

Remember ""Flawless"", ""Analyze it""? I also recall his last performance in ""Men of Honour"".. A question: ""Mr. De Niro, are you going to show us the level of performance you had 10 years ago or so, or should I put the film out of my agenda when I see your name in the cast?""Anyway, other cast members were not any better. Ben Stiller still tries to get dividend from his once-winning role in ""There's something about Mary"". But this material was too raw, and it did not have the level of Farelli's movie.In total, I think the toilet-jokes already make the public yawning. I am sure next summer we will see something like ""You, yourself and Irene"", ""Meet my grand-parents"" or ""There's nothing about Cameron Diaz"". But isn't it a time to find something new in comedy genre?I heard that the studio was already preparing the ""Meet the Parents - 2""..Goshh!

There have been some bad offenders, but this movie takes it to ridiculous extremes.  Ben Stiller's character is weak, stupid, dishonest, unsympathetic, and way beyond the threshold of believability. And even if those things don't bother you, the movie just isn't funny.The people responsible for this dud should take some lessons from ""There's Something About Mary"".  That had much riskier humour, which could have blown up in their face, but worked.  One of the reasons was because under the gruff exterior, it had a good heart.  It had *charm*.  Under this contrived mess of insecurity and deception was nothing but a lump of coal.  I felt the stupid Focker deserved every bad thing that happened, and more.  The sappy Hollywood ending rang hollow as a result.  Pheh.",Meet the Parents

It felt like a bad episode of Three's Company, with a big budget.The humor was weak and thin, most of the funny moments were shown in the previews, and the especially sad part was, over and over there were WONDERFULLY funny situations and setups, that would just fall flat. Most of the humor was the kind of disparaging ""how embarrassed can we make the poor little Jewish boy"" junk that Three's Company and it's ilk made famous.Apparently the rest of the world loves this movie, but I was embarrassed walking out of the theatre, and wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy (well, maybe him, since he has no taste anyway).",Meet the Parents

But I didn't like this one.What makes this movie different from other movies of this genre, is that our main character Greg Focker isn't the typical stupid guy with a good heart that we see in comedies of this sort. Instead, Greg is a real jerk, who takes every chance he can to do something nasty. He displays himself as a coward and a liar -- a rather spine-less person. Incidentally, he is revealed to be Jewish, and perhaps one could say that he fits a stereotypical Jewish movie depiction: whining and full of self-pity.However, there were actually some surprisingly comical moments in the movie that made me laugh out loud. But the plot was just too stupid. Greg doesn't miss a single opportunity to blow something. In fact, he must have done damage for around 1,000,000 $. But will the father, Jack Byrnes, forgive him at the end? That was what I asked myself during the film: ""how will they stitch this all together"". I won't reveal the end, but I did find it uplifting compared to the previous hour.I feel a little sorry for Robert De Niro who had to act in such a silly film. However, he does his part very convincingly, of course.",Meet the Parents
254,novella221,Ben Stiller rules!,8,28 July 2005,"This film is SO funny. It follows couple Greg(Stiller) and Pam(Polo) who go and spend a weekend at Pam's parents for her sister's wedding. This also happens to be the first time Greg has met Pams parents, hence the title-'Meet the Parents'. Pam's father isn't the most laid back of people in fact he's rather scary and they couldn't have chosen anyone better to play Jack Byrnes than Robert DeNiro. This is a different role for DeNiro from his other films but you can still see his character hold some of his old roles. Poor Greg is taken on a roller-coaster with only himself to blame. You can't help but feel sorry for him as he seems like an outcast especially when they all go and party at Kevin's mansion (Wilson) who's Pam's ex fiancée-I mean can you actually imagine that happening to you, it's so cruel. Ben Stiller is great in this film and I love his acting. He's great at playing the vulnerable, clumsy guy who only wants to keep everyone happy. I mean this guy was never given a chance even from birth when his parents named him Gaylord'Greg' Focker. This film made him one of my favourite comedy actors. He doesn't need to pull faces, and go OTT like the Jim Carreys of the acting world. Instead you feel as though Stiller is a lot like Gaylord 'Greg' Focker in real life which makes him even more likable. The film is great and full of funny moments and no worries, Greg finally ends up in the 'Circle of Trust'.Poor Greg!",Meet the Parents

Robert DeNiro is just brilliant in the role of the father, even though this role is different from those he usually plays. His excellent performance is definitely what makes this movie so special. But also Ben Stiller deserve a lot of credit. He is perfectly chosen for the role of Greg Focker'. He has just gotten the right face for it.  And don't forget the dialogue. The whole movie is full of memorable quotes. If you like the film and don't have it on DVD yet, then get it soon. The DVD offers a lot of special features like deleted scenes and, what's most amusing, outtakes. My rating is definitely 10/10.",Meet the Parents
258,averroes111,"A few good laughs, mostly due to the good actors; but an uneven effort at times",7,7 November 2000,"Well, this movie should be watched with disbelief fully suspended, since it is essentially a farce mixed with a heavy dose of slapstick.  It was pretty stupid and unoriginal at times, and often elicited groans from me (more stupid pet tricks.)  But it was also delightful and funny at times, mostly in the smaller moments that were a little less over the top, but also in some of the setup and ""payoff"" in some of the writing.  For instance, I thought the outcome of the pool volleyball game was funny and kind of shocking at the same time -- but in a very good way. ;)Most of what made the film mildly entertaining for me was simply the performances by Ben Stiller and Robert DeNiro.  Neither role was that much of a stretch for either of them, as they both were firmly planted in self-parody territory, doing what we've seen them do many times before. Still, even though Stiller and DeNiro are doing little more than selling their ""dog and pony act,"" they are really good at it, and I still enjoyed what they did most of the time anyway.All in all, if you go in with the right attitude (not expecting too much), you'll surely get a few good laughs before you get back in the car and go home.

Everyone dates and every one has to face the parent or parents of their significant other at one time or another. I thought this film was very good. De niro's character is very realistic. The movie has a lot of laughs because of the genre background of the actors. I think Jay Roach definitely knew what he was doing when he casted Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller. Both of these particular actors carry an opposite approach on comedy. When you put the two together you will have a hard time keeping a straight face. Just as the actors did in the making of this genius comedy. If you watch the extras on the DVD you will see the how hard it was for two totally different styles collaborating to bring you this type of ""de ja vu"" experience. I highly recommend the purchase of this DVD to anyone. It was all the round funny for the whole family. Fathers, daughters, boyfriends, mothers, and even children can relate. Nothing less than brilliant for strategic marketing. As an actor myself i can say clearly that everyone in the film was casted perfectly. The story is as simple as any really. Greg Focker wants to marry his girlfriend and has to face her (ex cia agent) father. He is gonna be very mysterious and psychological in determining whether Greg is right for his little girl or not. Trust me, you'll love this film. Of course at the climatic point Greg experiences nothing more than just a thorn in the Burn's eye's. He must quickly think of solutions to capture their hearts and acceptance into the family. Everything he does negatively turns around on him. I don't want to spoil any more of the film, you will have to watch to see the turn-out of this hilarious addition to cinematic archives.",Meet the Parents

What's so funny about spraying s**t at people? None of Greg Focker's misfortunes made me laugh; they were just annoying.

This is a funny movie.  Stiller's dead pan looks and DeNiro's sly smirk work perfectly.  Yes, the situations are a bit far fetched, but it's a comedy! I don't normally comment about other comments, but in general, there were some comments that talk about lack of surprise or lack of story or lack of interest.

It perfectly sums up the terrifying feelings men go through when they meet the in-laws for the first time. It's my nightmare, down to the cat, who the hell prefers a cat over a dog? The breakfast scene is the worst. Owen Wilson's character is the most punchable guy on the planet. I would have dropped that fool the second I met him, like we were on the yard and I needed to establish the fact that I'm top dog now.

Unfortunately, we have been exposed to a plethora of these films for too long as more and more of this type of banal movie is served up appealing to increasingly demoralized audiences as certain movie makers lose sight of the hilarious belly busters of yesteryear with their razor sharp script writers, ludicrous plots and acting beyond belief.

Now imagine you're Ben Stiller.Now you see where ""Meet the Parents"" gets all its best laughs.A middling comedy-of-the-uncomfortable escapade in which casting is the key, ""Parents"" stars Stiller as Greg Focker, a very nervous boyfriend spending a nightmare weekend at the childhood home of the girl he loves (Teri Polo).Plagued by Murphy's Law while trying desperately to buddy up to her folks, Greg's missing luggage containing the engagement ring is the least of his problems (that is, until the wrong bag is delivered later, packed with S&M paraphernalia). He can't seem to get a laugh out of Mom (Blythe Danner) and Dad to save his life. His little white lies -- a domino effect begun when his girlfriend whispers ""Oh, yeah, and we're not living together,"" as they arrive -- keep coming back to bite him in the backside. And before long the slapstick kicks in: A spilled urn of grandma's remains, a sorry substitute for a missing housecat and an overflowing septic tank are all pivotal gags in what should be a side-splitting comedy.When he and De Niro are playing off each other, this gag-fest is at its best -- but mostly because De Niro has a hilarious arsenal of innocuously threatening glances he keeps feeding the camera at a steady clip. He catches Stiller poking around the polygraph machine in his concealed workshop and says ""Go ahead, try it on!"" like a suspiciously encouraging carnival barker.Overall: 9.5/10",Meet the Parents
282,coltonvaughn10,Utterly disappointing,2,2 February 2014,"I have heard nothing but positive things about Meet the Parents, and I watched it, boy was that an epic waste of time. I'm not one for ranting on a movie that I think is atrocious so I'll try to be brief. Let's start with the positive of this movie....... Yea that's about it. There isn't much. There is very little that satisfied me, but it's a matter if preference with this movie. Here's why.Everyone was essentially a miss on casting, in my opinion. They did their job, but other actors could have done it better. For example, this is a comedy movie that relies on awkward comedy. It is exactly that. 100% awkward. If that's the comedy you like, this is your movie. I'm not a big fan of awkward comedies like this, so they have to be really good comedies for me to enjoy them. The cast does their job, but it could have been done better by other people. I feel like I'm starting to rant, but I'll conclude here. It's a great movie if you like this style of comedy, if you don't this movie will not win you over, or even come close.",Meet the Parents

Anyway, this movie was my most favorite black comedy (and my first one, too), and this movie does have meaning in it. The humor in this movie was a bit stupid, but once again, it did have meaning in it. I was surprised when a person mentioned that Greg's last name is Focker, which is surprising when I saw this movie. And there was another part when you realize that Greg's real name is Gaylord Focker. I was also surprised by this, too, because who would name their son, Gaylord? I hope to see the reason why the Fockers decided to name their son Gaylord, because I've seen Meet the Parents, and now I want to see Meet the Fockers. I've seen the trailers in the official site, and I thought it was hilarious. Since I can't write spoilers for this movie, I have to tell you guys this: This movie actually has meaning!

Unrealistic. Yeah, well, that is comedy, it is NOT supposed to realistic.At the end it is fine. So I would say it is ok to watch it.For me, comedy either has to start ridiculously impossible or close to reality and possible. Somewhere in between will just spoil the fun.

The recurring theme was that every tragedy that the family faced was somehow Greg's fault.I was amazed at how disappointed I was in the movie. I am a great fan of both Mr. De Niro and Mr. Stiller.

I think that's the most positive remark I can make. I felt a lot of the humor was of the tedious unfortunate-misunderstanding-or-miscommunication variety.Also, I don't think Robert DeNiro turns in the performance he usually does. For the most part, though, he and the rest of the cast make it work. I never really felt everything come together here the way it has in other movies involving Ben Stiller or DeNiro.Having said that, I'm glad I saw it, and it's probably better than a lot of what is out there.",Meet the Parents
288,TPC-5,I haven't laughed this hard at the movies in a long time,8,16 October 2000,"Hollywood should make more movies like this.  Movies that don't count on toilet humor, or a group of unfunny, try to be hip people, talking about unfunny, try to be hip, topics that just aren't funny or hip to get a laugh. They should relies on smart, funny writing, and a great cast that seems to enjoy the material they are given.  The plot is simple, Ben Stiller's character is trying to impress his girlfriend's father enough to give him permission to marry her. Robert De Niro plays the father from hell who grills Stiller every chance he gets.  Every lie, ever statement, every action is under De Niro's scrutiny, and believe me, Stiller does more than enough to alienate himself from the father.  It starts out badly and gets worst as the movie progresses.     This is Stiller's best work since Something about Mary.  He plays basically the same type of persona, but lets face it, it's a funny persona.  The nice guy who is just caught up in events that start out innocently , but quickly spiral out of his control, and every attempt to right things just brings up more problems.  I also think this is De Niro's best comic performance since Analyze This.  A simple sneer at the rambling prayer Stiller gives at the diner table brought a huge laugh from the audience I saw the movie with.  So many funny lines, so many funny moments, I could never list them all.   See this movie and you'll see, this is the best comedy to come along in years.",Meet the Parents

290,Keith I Price,"Meet the parents aims to high and fires too low, the most overrated movie in recent years.",5,24 June 2001,"Magazine reviews, word of mouth and trailers had me expecting to see the next all American comedy hit since 'There's something about Mary'.  What i experienced when i sat down to watch this film was a film that aims to achieve such accalaids as its '...Mary' but instead offers a flat, dull comedy that does offer some very funny set pieces, (most of which had been used in the trailer).Stiller is consistant as the likable romantic lead who cannot please his future father in-law, played by DeNiro, who although is fully competent in a comedic role, is let down by a very dull character.The principle for the film is very good and the set piece ideas are all potential comedy classics, but the script (which excells in new levels of dullness) and the direction, hinder these scenes form fulfilling there potential.If any of you have ever seen 'The Bachelor party' with Tom Hanks, the 10 minute scene where he goes to his future in-laws house, you will see the potential this plot had.  The characters are all superior to Meet the Parents, which at the end of the day is the reason why Meet the Parents is a big let down.Don't get me wrong, its no disaster, I've seen worse movies, but for a film that promised so much and aimed so high, it misses the target by far too big a margin for it to ever sustain its place in 'comedy-classic' territory.... 5/10.",Meet the Parents

This movie is straight up clean fun from start to finish. What a great script. I was laughing the whole way through. DeNiro as the tough guy/comedy character is great, even better than it was in ""Analyze This."" I wonder if he's going to revert to those types of roles now. It's great to see such diversity in what he can play. He didn't even need to say anything, just holding up a cat called Mr. Jinx and puckering at it is enough to make any grown man cry from laughter. Stiller is at his best here as well, combining his Jewishness with a clutzy attitude makes for a hysterical combination. I'm glad he stayed away from all those Jewish family/mother jokes because they seem to be getting old. Great showing from the girl who played Stiller's fiance (can't remember her name right now). She's the one who added a touch of drama and romance to finish up the package. All in all, a great movie.",Meet the Parents

It was refreshing to see a simple story line develop into such a humorous snowball effect. And let's not forget Mr. Jinx.The supporting cast is excellent! Robert Deniro can play ANYONE and pull it off. Blythe Danner does a great job playing the doting mother and wife. Debbie, Denny, Dr. Bob and his parents, and...oh, yes...Kevin (Owen Wilson)was a scream.If you can hear them above the laughter, pay very special attention to the innuendo and the just-off-camera comments (i.e. Pam's new name and every other word being the new ""F"" word.)

It didn't work for me; Stiller was silly and tedious - the sort of guy any responsible father would want to keep out of the family - and de Niro was much less overbearing and unpleasant than he might have been.

Similar over the top tasteless humor as found in Something About Mary -- just not quite as vulgar or extreme. A great unwind-after-the-work-week flick.",Meet the Parents
330,bookworm-9,I think its Great!,9,29 October 2000,This was too funny!  I usually dont like Ben Stiller movies but this one is worth seeing.  Robert DeNiro is hilarious as the over the top dad.  The thing I most enjoyed about the movie is that it was easy to see these things happening in a real relationship.  Its not over the top like Something about Mary.The laughs are genuine.

331,dpangani,Best Comedy in 2000,8,15 October 2000,"This is simply the best movie comedy I have seen this year.  If it had a point to it, some deeper meaning, it would be in my running for best movie of the year.Put simply, this movie is one giant situation comedy without much anything more to say.  The gags are logical, but in no way truly predictable (i.e. you know *exactly* what's going to happen, to the very detail).  Granted, if you're really looking that far in advance for it, you're going to find it -- though you're not really enjoying the movie.  Overall, no cheap laughs, everyone is hard earned and set up nicely and logically.MTP generates a lot of laughs without being crude (unless you consider the play on last names).  It truly blew my expectations away.  The preview does not do this movie justice.  Even when I recognized some of the bits from the preview, they were funnier in the movie (except maybe the polygraph test, which is about the same).  There was no sap, no cheesey moments, save for the end, which tidies things up nicely.  Normally, I have no place in movie for those types of scenes, but this movie makes no attempts to say anything more anyway, so it is excusable.Watch this movie.  It destroys Scary Movie (vulgar and crude, ""so stupid it has to be funny"") in terms of sheer hilarity.  I also rate MTP above There's Something About Mary, and American Pie because, again, it does not have to lower its standards to get cheap laughs.  Also, the pace is much better than these other movies.  The timing is excellent, with plenty of logical humor as well as physical hilarity.",Meet the Parents

Fortunately that crisis lasts only 10 minutes, but while it's going on you really wish you were somewhere else.  Stiller is excellent as always, and his performance, basically a reprise of his Something About Mary role of comical downtrodden everyman, is what really holds the movie together.  The scene on the airplane, the car racing scene, and the final scene of the movie made me laugh pretty damn hard.

Even taxidrivers get older, one must realize. And when they do, they want to entertain on the good old family playground. It is in many ways an old-fashioned film, well acted and nice to relax to.

Lots of the scenes and situations are contrived, and it's full of throw-away one-liners (who on earth names their son 'gaylord focker'?).

I think most would agree that Ben Stiller and Robert DeNiro are good actors. But in this case, they were saddled with an unfunny script and unlikeable characters.None of the jokes were funny. Stiller raising heck on a jet might have been mildly amusing before 9/11, but it certainly is not now. The scene with Stiller hooked up to the lie detector was just a yawner. Even the cat couldn't do anything funny! And i love cats! lolThis movie is only for serious DeNiro and Stiller fans. Basically it is just a waste of 2 hours of your time.

342,exdumpling,Hilarious!,10,21 November 2002,"I noticed that some people have said that the gags in this movie are unfunny and predictable... they complained about not very many laugh-out-loud gags. I completely disagree.This movie is one of the smartest comedies of the last few years. It does not rely on gross-out gags (like Something About Mary, etc...) and still manages to be hilarious. All of the humor is contained in the intelligence of the writing and the tenseness of the situations in the movie. Yes, you feel very sorry for Greg, but it feels OK in this movie to laugh at his expense.When I initially saw the previews for this movie a few years ago I had no desire to see it, as it seemed like it would be just like any other generic comedy. I only ended up seeing it because I had nothing better to do some random Friday night. I was very pleasantly surprised!This movie is not at all a generic comedy. The gags are brilliantly crafted and completely original. I think that people who think this movie is generic do not appreciate intelligent, non-bathroom humor. The praying scene and Jack's poem at the dinner table are brilliant. Also Greg's run-in with the flight attendant is great.Maybe the thing that really did it for me in this movie is that, despite their weirdness, Pam's family is completely believable and real. I actually know people like that. There is a whole culture of upper-class people who really do behave like the Byrnes family in this movie. I thought it was hilarious that the movie was making fun of that culture (I am also reminded of the groom's family in My Big Fat Greek Wedding). That part really struck home with me and made the movie even more funny.Great movie! Not generic at all! Very original and laugh-out-loud funny.",Meet the Parents

344,protopor,What can a guy in love do when all are against him?,6,22 August 2006,"**My name is Phantom. I'm from Europe (Hellas) Sorry for my English** This movie has something special without knowing. Ben Stiller wants to marry his girlfriend but before the proposal he thinks best to meet her parents. However, he chooses the most inappropriate time as the DeNiro house - the bride's parents - are busy with the wedding of their other daughter. Stiller tries to win DeNiro's sympathy by paying attention to his rules (he cuts smoking and having sex - just for a while of course). However, the groom's family - including Polo's ex-boyfriend - seem to snob Stiller's name and job by their way. They think Stiller is a stranger and they ignore him by the first moment. However, he turns to a hero when he finds DeNiro's cat but he turns to a jerk again a little later when the real cat is found. As a result, he becomes nervous and his bad luck leads to a series of goofs: he loses his suitcase at the airport, turns the garden into a swamp, sets on fire the wedding place and breaks the vase with what-is-left by DeNiro's mother. And that's where the people laugh. By watching this bad luck. Stiller tries to prove that he values more than what they think and at last he manage to marry his beloved girlfriend... but there is something else in the air. DeNiro wants to meet Stiller's parents... You will understand my thoughts if you watch this film by Stiller's eyes, which I believe was the ideal choice for the role. DeNiro remains in our minds as the old-CIA agent, not that this matters a lot in the movie. Many trivia will appear however in ""Meet the Fockers"" where this unique surname is used. This is a famous movie, a great comedy, there is nothing more to say... Just watch it! And you will not lose.",Meet the Parents

Great casting in this movie, poor Nicole DeHuff, her career shortened earlier this year, but this movie will allow us to remember her and she will be missed. Her scene with her getting hit by the volleyball was a hit scene for Meet The Parents.The only downside to this film is from the middle of the film, it seems to get dumber and dumber, but the introduction of the name Gaylord Focker made almost everyone laugh.

366,darqness,Cruel and Unkind,1,22 April 2003,"The very first thing that irritated me about this film was the appalling gag used throughout the film. The man is named Greg (Gaylord) Focker. Although his surname sounds vaguely like a swearword, this is a very thin gag which is the basis of huge chunks of the film. This is the first cruel part of this film.The film is focused towards victimising the main character. Instead of making gags about the mistakes he makes inadvertently, he is forced to make these mistakes. It is so rigid. It seems that all acting and storylines are suspended until the next mistake happens and then the next five minutes is verbal abuse at what best can be described as accidents.It seems that the entire family, including his girlfriend are hoping and praying for him to make a mistake so that they can get rid of him. He tries to impress and help the family. They make no attempt to apologise when they are at fault.Many other reviews focus on the fact that you can identify with the main character, this enables you to laugh at this film. This is the entire problem with this film. The fact that you can identify with the character makes this film even harder to watch. If Ben Stiller hadn't done such a great job at portraying this character then maybe I could stand to laugh. His performance was too good. I put myself in his shoes once too often during this film and was disgusted with the way he is treated.The character is too nice to laugh at. He is true to himself. (His job choice) He cares about other's beliefs. (Asking her father for permission) He is desperate to please and earn the respect and acceptance of his 'new' family.The rest of the cast is exposed to be cruel and nasty at various points in the film.

368,Kevken93,The worst movie ever.,1,26 June 2011,"OK before i talk about this i have to say that there will be two spoilers and those two spoilers are the only two 'jokes' in this thing we call a movie. How anybody can find this torturous thing entertaining or humorous in any way shape or form baffles me.The first o so funny joke the seemingly 10 year old writers throw at us is our main characters name being GAYLORD FOCKER. I would nearly consider forgiving the movie this joke if it was never brought up again and the movie went on to even being a pretty good family comedy but sadly no. What is funny about it?, because it sounds like a curse word maybe....No still not laughing. If you have not watched this movie yet and you wonder whats the big deal about one stupid little joke well the answer is that they use it about 20 times during this 90 minute horror. It was not funny the first time, it most certainly wasn't funny the second time and guess what it isn't funny the 20th time either.Amazingly though that is not what wreaks the movie no that would be our second joke. When i say joke this time it is actually more of an scenario rather than a run of the mill scene, this is of course awkwardness (if that makes any sense). The situations that our main character gets himself into are always the same awkward situations time and time again. Of course meeting your girlfriends or wife's mother and father will feel weird at first but for god sake. There isn't one shot in this movie that doesn't involve our main character(stiller) making a complete fool of himself, it gets to the point where its almost hard to watch the rest of the movie. This makes the movie uncomfortable and boring and also makes you hate stiller or should i say Gaylord.Having the audience hate the main character in a comedy is unforgivable. The casting is pretty standard having Stiller (who is very hit and miss in a lot of his films) as our main guy with Robert De Niro who continues to destroy his once gracious career as the spiteful father. Teri Polo plays Stillers girlfriend but she seems to have forgot that people are meant to have personalities and a little acting ability. As for the rest well none really stand out except for the always unfunny Owen Wilson as the successful ex-boyfriend.Its not as if this is completely meant for kids either because there are some jokes that kids wouldn't understand this begs the question do the film makers actually think that adults will find this garbage amusing. I would almost go as far as calling the movie insulting as it is obviously meant for fools which you are if you find this good to watch.",Meet the Parents

That said, this movie hit home harder than any comedy in years.My biggest concern going into the film was that all of the funny scenes were 'spoiled' by the preview.  This was certainly not the case.  ""Meet the Parents"" had my girlfriend and I guffawing unabashedly.  The rest of the audience seemed a bit slow to pick up on the sense of humor of the film, but soon caught on.

As we watch Greg's downfall, we can't help but laugh and feel sympathy for him. Every thing he does goes wrong while he's only trying to impress his girlfriend's parents.  The scene with Greg in the airport is classic! If you're looking for a great comedy without being overly grossed out and a toilet trained cat, check out Meet the Parents...you'll be glad you did.",Meet the Parents

374,kgraves-2,A little over the top,5,27 October 2000,"This movie had its moments, but is all-in-all rather pedestrian.  I'd rate it decent matinee seeing.  If you are not into slapstick humor, you may want to pass on this one.  Ben Stiller's character never gets a break...emphasis on never...and every new situation keeps upping the stakes to the point of being ridiculous.  My two friends enjoyed it, but I found it to be a bit trying.",Meet the Parents

379,ghostwriter-2,A fresh new comedy from Jay Roach,10,3 October 2000,"In the wake of a lackluster summer at the movies comes a fresh new comedy from Jay Roach.The film is laugh out loud funny. Go see this picture. I'm sure if you're reading this review you know the story.The acting is splendid. De Niro proves he is the greatest actor of his generation and maybe of all time. Stiller continues to impress. He has perfected the awkward everyman schtick. The supporting players are all fine with a special note for Blythe Danner and the underused Owen Wilson.Aesthetically the film is simple, but Roach keeps the film moving at a pleasant pace. It is obvious that he let his actors improv and it was a wise decision. The chemistry is remarkable.I truly think this is a wonderful film and I definitely will be seeing it again. So, I'll make myself sound like a studio plant and say, ""go see this movie as soon as possible, it is well worth the price of admission.""",Meet the Parents

My husband was equally bored and, for only the second time in either of our lives, we left the movie before it was over.

385,joshuali,Right Movie for the Wrong Reason.,8,2 April 2001,"This was set out to be a hysterical, even the Grossout film. However I didn't get that impression when I saw this. I think it is a excellent romance movie, and a ok comedy.Despite the physical humor and impossibly bad circumstances surrounding Greg (aka Gay Lord) Focker (BEN STILLER) his trip is not completely out of this world. Almost everyone has a nightmare story when meeting your boy/girl-friends' parents. I for one can relate the story depicted in this movie. Although not as bad, but certainly memorable.Even if it's rated Comedy, the film does present a drama of relationships, how the Daughter Loves Greg; how the farther-in-law from Hell (ROBERT DeNIRO) leans to accept Greg for what he is. It proves Love is inseparable. Even it's a CIA agent in between.it's laughs were all funny and good. But it does not bring it self above the bunch with that. (in fact Jim Carrey does it much better) What really sets MEET THE PARENTS apart is the fact that, beneath the laughingstock surface, there is a serious human story of love to be told.I give it an 8 out of 10",Meet the Parents

Anything that can go wrong goes wrong when Greg Fokker (Ben Stiller) meets his father in law (Robert De Niro). I thought it was really sweet the way Greg tried proposing to his fiance with the group of school children holding up signs ""Will you Marry Me?"" and it was really funny when the kids had trouble spelling it. Every time (Robert De Niro) calls greg by his last name ""Fokker"" it brought me to a whole new round of tears and laughter.

397,bowman20,Meet The Parents,9,5 December 2010,"This review includes a spoiler. Meet the Parents is about a man, Gaylord Focker, who goes by the name of Greg (Ben Stiller). He is living with his girlfriend, Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo), who he going to ask to marry him. He is not able to ask her yet because Pam invites him to parent's house to attend her sister's, Debbie (Nicole Dehuff), wedding. Pam's father, Jack Byrnes (Robert De Niro), is a retired CIA member who does not trust anyone and he still acts as if he is in the CIA. Jack and Greg do not get off on the right foot because Jack does not act like he likes Greg. So, the movie continues with Greg trying really hard to get Jack's approval while Jack does not make it very easy. Jack thinks that Greg is someone else because Jack could not find evidence of Greg taking a test to become a doctor. Jack tries to convince Pam that he has been lying to her. Greg tries to be helpful, but he ends up almost ruining Debbie's wedding so he gets ready to leave and his luggage arrives. The guy asks if he is Gaylord Focker, and he agrees. Jack realizes that Greg's true name is Gaylord and he made a mistake. So Jack goes to the airport to convince Greg to come back. So, Greg returns and asks Pam to marry him and she says yes. The movie ends with Jack stating that they have to meet Greg's parents. The theme of this movie is that people are always what they seem on the surface. Jack thought that Greg was a liar because Jack thought his first name was Greg except Gaylord is his first name. So, Jack was completely wrong which does not happen very often. Throughout the movie the viewer really roots for Greg because he is a good guy who is trying to impress his girlfriend's parents. He becomes the underdog of the film who can't catch a break. Greg has good intentions that usually end badly in this movie. The angle technique that is used in this movie is great. The viewers really feel like that could be Greg's character. Everyone has been there when they are trying to impress someone and it turns into a disaster. Another great technique that was used was the lighting. It was very natural and the viewers will feel like they are really in the movie. If you like the Family Stone, then you will love Meet the Parents. Robert De Niro does a great job as a bored retired CIA member, and Ben Stiller plays Greg's role very well. Enjoy this film as it unravels that things are not always what they seem.",Meet the Parents
398,KathyBatesLover,Amazing Movie,10,27 December 2004,Meet the Parents has to be one of the best movies ever created in the history of the cinema. It got me laughing in the first 10 minutes of the movie and I always die laughing when that cat pees in the grandma's ashes. The whole movie and every character in it was hilarious and Robert de Niro was an excellent father in that he was always overprotective of his daughter and would always nitpick everything Greg did like most father-in-laws-to-be would. Greg was funny in that he was very loving toward Pam and was EXTREMELY jealous of her old boyfriend Kevin. That stewardess lady was hilarious because she was such a pain to Greg and the sticks and the BOMB BOMB BOMB was funny until 9/11 but still is sort of funny. All in all I give this movie a 10 but I wish to give it more but regrettably I cannot! EXCELLENTE!,Meet the Parents
399,hauser01,Great Laughs and Love Story,6,12 December 2010,"A great laugh at a series situations one would never dream of and it even has a little love story. Ben Stiller has a well-known name for making his audience laugh. In the film Meet the Parents he does just that. Ben Stiller as Greg (Gaylord) Focker has staring in this film with him Academy Award winning Robert De Niro as Jack Byrnes, sure does make Greg's life a little more difficult than it already is. The film's theme displays how love can cause one to do crazy things and to accept people for who they are. Another film that can be compared is American Wedding 2003. The film begins when Greg a male nurse decides his girlfriend Teri Polo as Pam is the one he wants to marry. The couple flies to Pam's parents' house for her sister's wedding at the Byrnes, along the way Greg starts his line of bad luck. As they drive up Pam's father Jack is staring out the window, he is already judging Greg. Jack calls for Pam's cat Mr. Jinx and she tells her parents that Greg hates cats. This puts Greg in an awkward situation and he lies saying he does not. Jack questions him on why he likes dogs over cats. Greg is trying to win Jacks approval so Jack will allow Greg to ask Pam to marry him. Jack has already developed assumptions about Greg. He judges him for being a male nurse and even makes fun of him. Jack wants to investigate Greg. He tries to find any information he can on him. Greg see's Jack talking to a man outside a store and tries to act like he did not see him there. Greg somehow gets nervous and makes up some lies about milking a cat. Jack wants to know about this story. Soon Greg realizes that Jack is testing him. Greg is asked to sleep the den where he continues on his line of back luck. He finds a unique room with a light on and enters. Jack then comes in and tells Greg he should do a lie detector test. Greg freaks out about this and is extremely nervous. Greg then is told some interesting information, that Jack is a former CIA investigator. He then is told he has entered the Burn's circle of trust. The next day is the day before Pam's sister's wedding. There are various fast passed introductions of different characters. Greg is introduced to Owen Wilson as Kevin Pam's ex fiancée. He develops a judgment of him and jealousy. During this time Greg is questioned by Jack about many different things. Greg continues to have various things happen to him that keeps the audience laughing at each situation. Greg faces many difficulties when trying to follow all the rules of Jack Byrnes. He has many problems occur, that make it really difficult for Jack to like Greg. Jack feels that Greg is lying about many different things. Then Greg is taken out of the circle of trust.

400,clonin01,Great Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro Comedy,8,13 December 2010,"Greg ""Gaylord"" Focker played by Ben Stiller is a male nurse who is invited to meet is fiancé to be Pam's parents so that he can get their permission. However, former CIA Agent Jack Byrnes played by Robert De Niro puts Greg through a living hell before anything happens. While staying at the house he finds out that his luggage is misplace by the airport and later gets the third degree from Jack. With Jack, being a former CIA agent he uses tactics he learned to make sure that Greg is the right man for his little girl. The motif based around Greg's struggles thought the whole movie. From the struggles with his luggage, the male nurse insults, to the invasive questioning from Jack. Yet being a heavy struggle for him the comedy is flowing like all movies that star Ben Stiller. Furthermore, although Jack does play sarcastic, aggressive parents there are many comic scenes that make the movie funny as well. Next, Kevin played by Owen Wilson is trying to get back Pam the girl he had lost in his past. During time that Kevin had met Greg, Kevin keeps telling Greg about the good times that him and Pam had in their past. This puts a little frustration as well as comical competition between them. Since her family is completely overwhelmed with Kevin, Greg has to go out of his way to show Pam's family he is the right man her. Another one of the more comic parts of the movie is when the cat goes to the next-door neighbors but Greg thinks he is lost and tries to replace it with a stray. When the stray gets into the house the wedding dress of Pam's sisters shredded by the cat, yet everyone else is at dinner. While Greg is placing calls to find out about his luggage, Jack is finding about the cat and also finding out more about Greg's past. The final draw is when her family is insulting him about not becoming a doctor and his name, which is Gaylord. Whenever Jack gets the rest of the information back about Greg, after Jack finds out that everything that he said was true he feels that Greg should be placed back into his family's inner circle once again. But by that time Greg is getting on the plane to head back and gets arrested by security for attacking a flight attendant and Jack has to use his CIA Agent security to get him out of trouble. Throughout this movie, there have always been struggles against Greg but the audience will laugh through every one of them.",Meet the Parents

In the end it's just Ben Stiller doing everything wrong. thats just not funny nor entertaining. On the other hand there are some scenes, that are just great. Like when he wants to check in at the airport and when he is on the plane.

402,dpasq-1,Worst. Movie. Ever.,1,7 January 2005,"Sorry, but I just don't see how anyone can find this movie funny. I put the spoiler warning on this comment since I am about to give away the biggest comedic device in the movie. As unbelievable as it sounds, the protagonist in the movie has a last name that rhymes with a naughty word. His last name is Focker! Why is this piece of information a spoiler? Because joke after joke after joke after joke is made on this simple premise. In fact, it's so hilarious that they felt the need to put it in the title of the next movie! In addition, the scenarios in this movie were so far fetched that instead of being able to enjoy it, I spent the entire time wondering why the writers were so lazy that instead of coming up with reasonable plot scenarios, they just passed off ridiculous decisions in order to force supposedly humorous scenes. Case and point - Ben Stiller's character loses his luggage while on the way to meet his fiancée's parents. The first morning he wakes up in his fiancée's family's house, he wants to change clothes but doesn't have any. His fiancée suggests that he borrow some of her brother's clothes. So far, this all seems reasonable. Stiller's character then asks her to go get some of these clothes. Instead, she tells him it would make more sense that even though he has yet to meet her brother, he should walk into his room unannounced and feel free to root through his bureau until he finds something he wants. Would any person in their right mind ever suggest such a thing? Needless to say, her brother then catches this man he doesn't know going through his underwear drawer. That's it! That's the big joke! And that is supposed to be funny! I could go on with numerous examples just as ridiculous as this that litter this movie, but I've wasted enough time. If I can convince just one person not to waste the 2 hours of his or her life on this abomination of a film, I will consider this exercise worth while.1 out of 10",Meet the Parents

404,mommyoftna,funny movie,10,22 December 2004,"I loved this movie. This movie introduced me to Ben Stiller's work. Him and Robert Deniro were a perfect match. The cast was wonderful and worked well together. I can relate to the plot, it seems like any time one is trying to impress another something is bound to go wrong. Poor Greg (Ben Stiller) just seems to have the worst luck. It puts a different perspective on how airlines deal with people. The airline doesn't handle baggage very well and so I can understand why he would not want to check his bag again. The fact that he said ""Its not like I have a bomb"" does not make it less funny just because 9/11 happened. If airlines actually took things this seriously then they might have prevented 9/11 from happening. So those who don't like this scene should lighten up and not take it out on funny movies made before the horrible event occurred. I enjoyed this movie very much.",Meet the Parents
405,iKodak,Great cast for a laugh,7,16 November 2014,"I like this movie; It's a comedy that depicts what happens when a man is introduced to his girlfriend's family for the first time. This guy ends up getting himself into a world of trouble that he never expected. The great actors truly make the film. First, Robert De Niro gives an great performance in this film and is absolutely funny. Ben Stiller (Greg) as the male lead is his usual funny self. Finally, Owen Wilson is also responsible for a lot of laughs throughout the film. The casting for this movie does not disappoint.The problems he faces will have you in stitches and one of the best things about this movie is that everyone can relate. We all have those awkward moments that make us cringe. Regardless of your embarrassing situation, Greg has probably gotten into something worse. You can't help but laugh hysterically at his expense.Finally, I really like how just when everything seems to finally be going right, it can turn around in an instant. So many times you think that Greg is finally going to make a good impression but he messes things like only him can, sending you into inevitable laughter. Overall, this is a great movie with a mix of a ton of laughs and a love story all rolled into one. If you're looking for a pick-me-up, this is undoubtedly the movie for you.",Meet the Parents
