0,bkoganbing,Hidden his incarceration,5,8 June 2018,"Watching Buffalo 66 because as per the title the film was shot a good deal in
the city that is home to me now. I did recognize a few places, but the rather
weird story kind of put me off.Vincent Gallo plays a young man newly released from prison who has hidden
his incarceration from his parents is now coming home to his less than loving
parents Ben Gazzara and Angelica Huston. He's said he's married so he has to
produce a wife. What to do but kidnap a wife and in this case Christina Ricci.Usually that kind of premise signals a comedy, but Buffalo 66 is anything but.
Sadly the best part of the film is with the parents which covers about half.
The rest is half.Gallo and Ricci are quirky but in this case it wasn't enough to grab me and hold
my attention. I'm in agreement with other reviewers who say Gallo feels no
self worth due to the environment he was raised in. The future isn't optimistic
for either of them.Acting honors go to Gazzara and Huston. Wish the whole film had been about
these two self centered jerks.",Buffalo '66
1,SnoopyStyle,annoying pathetic character,5,4 January 2015,"Billy Brown (Vincent Gallo) is bitter and angry after five years in prison. He gets released, looking for a place to pee and kidnaps tap dancing student Layla (Christina Ricci). He had lied to his parents (Ben Gazzara, Anjelica Huston) that he's been married while away with a government job. She has to be his pretend wife Wendy Balsam. He is severely damaged and she's oddly interested in him. Billy had put $10k on Buffalo to win but the kicker Scott Wood misses the game winning field goal. Billy vows to kill him. His friend Goon (Kevin Corrigan) claims that Scott now owns a strip club. Billy and Layla bump into the real Wendy Balsam (Rosanna Arquette) who Billy had a crush on. Billy is a really annoying jerk. A few times, I almost laugh but mostly, he is really really annoying. I like the imaginative visual style in this indie but I really can't stand Billy. It's a good performance from Gallo. His character shows more vulnerability later on but his defensiveness is also very pathetic. The words too-good-for-him keep coming to mind. It's not good chemistry as much as morbid fascination with their relationship.",Buffalo '66
2,lee_eisenberg,good except for one aspect,6,15 September 2006,"When I saw ""Buffalo '66"" around the time that it came out, I thought that it was fairly interesting, with Vincent Gallo as a pathetic man who gets released from prison in Buffalo, New York, and kidnaps Christina Ricci to pose as his wife so that he can face his parents (Ben Gazzara and Anjelica Huston). If absolutely nothing else, it was one of the two movies - along with ""The Opposite of Sex"" - that affirmed Ricci as America's indie queen.If I'd known then what I know now, I might have not even gone to see the movie. It now turns out that Gallo is a Bush supporter, and that seems to totally weaken the movie. How ironic that he co-stars with Anjelica Huston, one of the staunchest opponents of the Iraq invasion.So, it may be an interesting story, but the whole movie just seems a lot weaker nowadays. Also starring Mickey Rourke, Rosanna Arquette, Jan-Michael Vincent and Kevin Pollak.",Buffalo '66
3,jboothmillard,Buffalo '66,8,18 July 2011,"Like so many featured in it, I would have never known this film existed if I didn't read the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, it is also interesting to be directed by, written by and starring Vincent Gallo, who I had never heard of before. Basically Billy Brown (Gallo) has been released from prison after serving five years for a crime he did not commit, he has a dilemma though as he has told his parents, father Jimmy (Ben Gazzara) and mother Jan (Anjelica Huston), that he is married with a successful career. The first thing he is trying to do is find a place to pee, being very desperate, and he finally finds that running into a dance studio during a tap dancing lesson. With what he has told his parents in mind, he winds up kidnapping young tap dance student Layla (Christina Ricci), forcing her of course to drive him where he wants to go, change her name and of course pretend to be his wife. Billy's only instructions are to make him look in front of the parents, and she allows herself to go with everything he says, and Jimmy and Jan enjoy their dinner with their son and his pretend wife. But is apparent she is not just helping him out however she can, this also includes later having some photos taken together, but Layla may in fact truly find some attraction towards Billy, even with his objections not to touch him intimately. The subplot of the story, seen in some flashbacks, is that Billy went to jail because he lost a large cash bet on the Super Bowl XXV, Buffalo Bills against the New York Giants, in 1991, and he wants revenge on the man indirectly responsible, Scott Woods (Bob Wahl). Billy is struggling against these demons, chronic loneliness and his severe depression, but eventually he does slowly open up and give in to his feelings with Layla, in the end there is some form of resolution. Also starring Mickey Rourke as The Bookie, Rosanna Arquette as Wendy Balsam, Jan-Michael Vincent as Sonny, Kevin Pollak as TV Sportscaster, Alex Karras as TV Sportscaster and Kevin Corrigan as Rocky the Goon. Gallo has created an inventive and intriguing story, and directs the film is very stylistic fashion, but of course it is his on screen presence that is best, being an unlikeable but sympathetic character, as well as the beautiful Ricci being just as compelling as the one who is falling for him, a dark and unusual drama. Very good!",Buffalo '66
4,ccthemovieman-1,"Like Norwood's Kick, It Misses The Mark",1,28 June 2007,"I have to say Vincent Gallo played one of the sleaziest low-life guys I have ever seen in a film, at least in the first 30-some minutes. He was in every scene and was so scuzzy and so unappealing, it ruined the story for me. I was interested, too, because this is based in Buffalo, New York, and I live not far from the city. The are numerous references about the Buffalo Bills, too, so I wanted to enjoy that....even if it meant suffering again recalling all those Super Bowl losses, mainly Scott Norwood's missed field goal in their first Super Bowl.Listen, I know this is supposed to be a ""black comedy,"" and many times I love that sort of humor, but this was just so sordid it provided more winces and frowns than laughs. I just wanted to take a shower after watching and listening for 45 minutes to Gallo and this sordid story.To have a kidnap victim (Christina Ricci, also seems to play a lot of scummy roles in films) fall in love with this scumbag made the story all the more ludicrous. Only in the wonderful world of films do we constantly see good equals bad and vice/versa. This is a nonsensical, pretentious and gratuitously-profane piece of garbage with, as one fellow reviewer puts it in his headline, ""no redeeming values"":...and another black eye to the poor folks in Buffalo.Recommended only for severely disturbed people.",Buffalo '66
5,Tweekums,An interesting low budget film,8,30 March 2017,"Billy Brown has just got out of prison having served five years for a crime he did not commit. While inside he let is parents believe that he was busy with a government job, living with his childhood sweetheart Wendy Balsam. He goes to visit his parents and his mother wants to meet Wendy so he kidnaps a young woman and forces her to play the role. Layla, the woman concerned plays the role rather well; rather too well in fact as she gushes about how she fell in love with Billy while working for the CIA! While there we learn more about Billy and his unloving parents; we also learn how he ended up in jail and that he plans to kill the man he holds responsible the former kicker for the Buffalo Bills who missed an important kick that meant Billy lost a $10,000 bet; a bet he couldn't pat. After leaving the family home Billy and Layla go bowling, go out for a hot chocolate then find a hotel before Billy goes off to seek his final revenge.This is an unusual little film with a strange pair of protagonists. Billy is initially hard to like; he is a kidnapper after all, and Layla is a mystery; we know nothing about her including why she goes along with Billy even after he says she can go since the whole story takes place over the course of a few hours it can't be Stockholm Syndrome! Vincent Gallo does a fine job as Billy and Christina Ricci is equally good in the role of Layla. Gallo didn't just play the male lead; he also wrote this interesting story and directed the film. Some parts of the film are likely to leave the viewer squirming; the scenes in the family house are painful to watch for anybody would isn't keen on socially awkward scenes! There are also some laughs to be had along the way. Overall I'd recommend this to anybody looking for something a bit different; it won't be for everybody but I enjoyed it.",Buffalo '66
6,moonspinner55,Fancifully uncompromising,6,22 July 2002,"Odd mixture of moods in stark, high-definition drama starring Vincent Gallo as an ex-con just out of prison who immediately kidnaps a young woman and asks her to pose as his wife when he goes back home to his dysfunctional parents. Gallo, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Alison Bagnall and directed, goes for a kind of quasi-subtlety; he's careful and nuanced and yet, when scenes need a good kick, he hammers his points home with an unsteady hand (as with every moment involving Ben Gazzara, way over the top as Gallo's father). ""Buffalo '66"" isn't particularly fresh, but there's an exciting sense of raw talent emerging, and the movie has all the requisite pleasures therein. Gallo also composed the very fine score and gets mostly solid supporting work from his cast, including the sometimes-overrated Christina Ricci. **1/2 from ****",Buffalo '66
7,Coventry,Suburb pains...,5,7 November 2004,"Just released after a five-year term in prison as a consequence of gambling felonies, the introvert and emotionally frustrated Billy Brown (Gallo) returns to hometown Buffalo to meet up with his parents and to take vengeance on the person that indirectly caused him to do time. This being a former football player who made Billy loses a 10.000 dollar bet. He kidnaps a young girl named Layla (Ricci) and forces her to pretend she's his wife so that he looks good in his parents' eyes. Buffalo '66 would be a standard, unspectacular social portrait of American suburbia if it weren't for the vision of Gallo and the more than respectable cast. Gallo presents his first independent film as a director like a cruel autobiographic comedy, congested with egocentric characters (except for the cherubic Layla) and a hopelessly depressing tone. The casting in this production is downright excellent. Gallo himself is an obvious 'enfant terrible' but, to me, it was Billy's parents who impressed the most. Anjelica Huston is stunning as the indifferent football fan that prefers watching the game over her new daughter-in-law explaining how she and Billy met. And Ben Gazzara is even more impressive as the father who's still frustrated over his missed musical career. There are terrific supportive roles for Rosanna Arquette, Jan-Michael Vincent and Mickey Rourke (as the corrupt bookmaker).Buffalo '66 unquestionably is the best film Vincent Gallo ever was involved in. Normally, he just tries too hard to be controversial but this is real sentiment for a change! This film is simple but honest and it has feeling!",Buffalo '66
8,Boba_Fett1138,Originality makes this movie.,7,13 April 2012,"It's a Vincent Gallo movie, so of course it's going to be something different and original. Not that it's anything too pretentious or overly artistic but it just is different from what you are probably accustomed to seeing. Different can be good at times, when it works, as is luckily the case with this particular movie.Thing is that the movie its different and also unusual approach, makes this movie a very original one. It's not really a movie with a particular good script but the movie still manages to grab you and hold your interest, throughout. A real accomplishment by Vincent Gallo, who directed, wrote and played the main character in this movie.It's a pretty intriguing little movie, that deliberately keeps things small and simple. No overcomplicated plot, no over-the-top characters (well, only for comedy reasons maybe), no sentimental fake drama. It feels like a very honest and straightforward movie, which was really the main reason why I got taken by it and also really liked watching the movie.Vincent Gallo must have some pretty good connection, since he always manages to get some pretty big name actors in his movie, even while his movies are always quite small and low-budget ones. In this movie, people like Christina Ricci, Ben Gazzara, Anjelica Huston and Mickey Rourke make their appearances. A pretty good cast list, which a lot of filmmakers would love to work with.It's not a must-see in any way but it simply is a good movie!7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Buffalo '66
9,Wuchakk,"Mostly tedious, but Ricci is adorable, ""Heart of the Sunrise"" is featured and the message is potent",6,29 September 2018,"An angry sad sack (Vincent Gallo) is released after five years in prison near Buffalo and proceeds to kidnap a cute girl at a ballet studio (Christina Ricci). She surprisingly agrees to go along with the charade of being his wife to fool his nutty parents. His sole ambition seems to be to kill a field goal kicker for the Bills who let him down five years earlier. Anjelica Huston, Mickey Rourke, Jan-Michael Vincent and Rosanna Arquette have brief roles.""Buffalo '66"" (1998) is an offbeat indie written & directed by its star, Gallo. I only know him from Coppola's ""Tetro"" (2009) where he proved to have an almost Brando-like charisma (I said ""almost""). Ricci is one of the highlights here as she's petite, voluptuous and adorable. Unfortunately, most of the episodes in the story could've been cut by one-third or even one-half. As it is, they become tedious, such as the loong segment at the parent's house. But the final act wins the day with Yes' ""Heart of the Sunrise"" placed strategically and a profound moral about the power of uncompromising love to change a piece of sheet.The film runs 1 hour, 50 minutes and was shot in Buffalo, New York, and surround areas (Gowanda, Lackawanna and Woodlawn).GRADE: C+/B-",Buffalo '66
10,=G=,A one hit wonder's one hit?,7,2 September 2003,"Returning home to Buffalo, NY after being released from prison, an excon (Gallo) kidnaps a girl (Ricci) to show off as a trophy girl friend to his parents only to find his young charge is more interested in him than are his parents. ""Buffalo 66"", Gallo's directorial breakthrough, won some fringe awards and critical nods for its honest, gritty compassion. A bare bones production with a solid cast, ""Buffalo 66"" is too bleak for everyone as it presents its working class story with such realism as to make working class people shrug and ask ""Yeah? So?"". However, indie lovers into visceral realism won't want to miss what has been Gallo's best effort so far.(B)",Buffalo '66
11,KineticSeoul,"Great low budget film about a self-centered character, directed by a self-centered director",8,16 February 2011,"I really loved this movie, I really didn't know what to expect from this movie but I really enjoyed it. This is basically a very low budget film that is done very well, it's very engaging and I really liked the direction of it all. Vincent Gallo who directed and played the protagonist in this did a amazing job and although I am not fond of the actress Christina Ricci but she was okay in this and likable. This film didn't even take 2 million dollars to make, but it surpasses a lot of movies out there with way bigger budgets. The film is basically about a lonely guy that has a lot of built up anger and loneliness who kidnaps a girl in order to present her to his semi crazy parents as his loving wife. And the story goes on from there with some humorous manner and amusing at times. Although some of the characters may seem one dimensional, almost every actor and actresses in this done a really good job and actually memorable for the most part. Christina Ricci's character isn't fully explained in this or explored enough for the audience why she didn't just run away during few scenes. Vincent Gallo's character Billy Brown portrays a person that some people can actually relate with, especially some lonely or neglected people out there. Although Gallo and Ricci really hated each other in real life while making this movie, which isn't all that shocking. Because he is very self-centered from what I heard, but he still did a great job of directing it. It's a shame this film is overlooked and not viewed by enough people, cause this really is a engaging and fantastic movie that deserves to be viewed.8.2/10",Buffalo '66
12,paul2001sw-1,Dark with a light touch,8,21 June 2013,"Vincent Gallo's darkly comic, ultimately touching debut film, 'Buffalo 66', has a stellar cast playing unglamourous roles and a central turn from Gallo himself as insecure loser Billy, fresh out of prison and back in his native Buffalo, but with no real sense of home. The film departs occasionally from literal realism is a mostly effective, entertaining manner, but behind the quirkiness, this is a serious movie about the ability to be love and be loved. It is, however, all about Gallo: Christina Ricci's character presumably has some issues of her own (why else would she be hanging out with a loser like Billy?) but instead of exploring them, the film allows her at least a hint of the role of the forgiving angel, sent (or rather kidnapped) to rescue an otherwise doomed man. But it's still a successful film, one that visits some dark places, but brings the viewer out the other side.",Buffalo '66
13,Rodrigo_Amaro,Of doubtful taste but good,6,10 February 2013,"This makes you wonder about the relatively distinguishable thin line between artists and entertainers and what does it mean to be one or another or even a mix of both. What can be said of Vincent Gallo's efforts as a director? ""The Brown Bunny"" outraged many crowds out there not only because of its infamous real sex scene but because the work itself seemed an egoistical attempt to prove something to someone and that was the director trying to impress himself. It's quite pretentious, very empty but manageable, watchable. Now, the beloved ""Buffalo '66"" appears to have more logic, more sense and a good structure with its transitions from one scene to the next one, there's an artist moving and creating those moments and sometimes everything flows so easily, so it can't be art, this Jekyll is getting dominated by Mr. Hyde, the mindless entertainment. What's the verdict? But let us go down with the story: Gallo plays Billy, a convict just released from prison who has two plans on his mind: to kill the man responsible for his arrest and to pay a visit to his parents (Anjelica Huston and Ben Gazzara) of whom he doesn't have much of a good relationship, and during those years arrested he sent letters pretending he was working for the government on a secret project and that he also got married. The latter plan is absurd because he doesn't know anyone, he's deeply immersed in himself so what does he do? He kidnaps a girl (Christina Ricci) and forces her to be his wife while he's visiting his folks. All she has to do is to make him look nice before them, show that they are a loving couple. And who could have thought such plan not only worked out but also Billy got himself a bonus: the girl fell for him despite all of his cruelties and commands.What does ""Buffalo '66"" is trying to impose with its apparently innocuous speech? One direction: it's an unconventional love story with everything to go wrong but in the end it turns out alright. Another deeper perspective, which also includes the fore-mentioned view, merely says to us that misogynists, homophobes and scums of the earth deserve some love and understanding and they'll get it in the most strange of ways. That's what I get from watching this. Billy treats everybody bad, people seem to worth nothing for him (the only guy of whom he doesn't say a word and keeps with his head down through the whole time is the character played by Mickey Rourke) and he keeps going with this trend for on and on. Basically, with this movie Gallo is giving hope to many idiots out there who think acting like his character will give them something truly rewarding, they'll find true love...someday!If that's the way it's not supposed to be read, then why all the gigantic love this movie has? The story isn't appealing (except here and there), takes a whole lot of time to take over and to make us involved. At the top of all: the script is annoying as hell with its characters, specially Billy, repeating their lines and situations over and over. What's up with the bathroom thing? All the time he needed a bathroom. ""Just look at me. Just look at me"" or ""Goon! Goon!"" and even ""We are a couple that doesn't touch."" and always getting something involving chocolate. When Ricci's character was offered to have something brought to her by Billy, before she answered I said to myself ""If she says chocolate once again I'll give thumbs down to this movie!"". And she said it. But then, the climatic moment unfolded and it was beautiful, seemed to worth all the while and all the craziness. Won't say what happens in it except that it might be the greatest use of a Yes song in a movie with ""Heart of the Sunrise"" playing for quite a bit. Besides that moment there's some memorable good sequences such as Gazzara's dubbing a music pretending to be a great singer or the girl's story on how she met Billy, inventing their perfect love story. The man has some good imagination, I'll give you that. He can prove to be artistic but gotta work harder to be considered one. And it was an autobiographical story? Well...not much of an interesting one. At the end of the day it's just another purposeless story made to leave you at ease and distracted, enjoying the little entertainment it can offer you. Liked it but not that much and I'm still trying to figure out what's so special about it for people to love it. Almost forgot: and once again the man flattered himself about his member, this time not showing it but with someone saying ""But it's SO big!"" to him. Ugh... 6/10",Buffalo '66
14,helpless_dancer,Splendiferous,9,19 November 2004,"Never even heard of Gallo: just happened onto this film on IFC one night and totally loved it. The acting was superb, the story even more so; and that camera work! Gallo's character, Billy Brown, was a picture of hate and resentment due to his unfeeling, unloving parents who made it clear from day one that he wasn't wanted, much less loved. This pushing away by these heartless, empty people turned young Billy into a introvert who was only able to find love within the confines of his own dreamy mind. Of course, this was insufficient which drove Billy to acting out in some bizarre and dangerous ways. Finally, when love does come it terrifies him and causes him to push away this affection continuing the cycle started by his parents. At times I found myself rocking with laughter at the antics of these hurting and emotionally scarred folks, but the tale was anything but comical. I wish there were more pictures coming out as interesting and dramatic as this.",Buffalo '66
15,Anonymous_Maxine,"Buffalo '66 is a critically acclaimed film, and it gets its point across very clearly, but it is just too slow and obscure at certain points.",6,9 September 2000,"Everything in this film is ugly (except Christina Ricci), but it is meant to be like that, so in that sense, there is something to be said about the skillful writing and directing of the film. The acting is also very impressive, at least the majority of it. Vincent Gallo is sickeningly convincing as the ugly, disgusting man portrayed in the film, who is bent on seeking revenge on the man who he blames for his unjust stint in prison. Oddly enough, even though his performance provides a deep feeling of discomfort at times, it was an incredible performance. It is difficult to imagine Gallo as anything other than the kind of person that he played in this movie.Christina Ricci was just as beautiful as she alway is in her movies, but even though she was a very relieving character to watch while being bombarded with the misanthropic Billy Brown (Gallo), she also played the most unrealistic and unconvincing part in the film. Let's think about the logic here. A dirty and scruffy man is released from prison, he kidnaps this girl who would be attractive even if she wasn't a movie star, his communication with her is limited to impatient demands and insults intended to harm, and she freakin' falls in love with him. He never said a single nice word to her, with the exception of his forced and slight apology after he is finally able to relieve himself at the beginning of the film. Their entire relationship is so ridiculously unrealistic that it almost overshadows every other thing that the film accomplishes.
Besides that, some of the scenes were downright boring. A good majority of the scenes that took place when they went to Billy's parents' house comes to mind. The editing was botched with the point of view shots at the dinner table, as well. Buffalo '66 is not a pretty film, but it is meant to be ugly. It would have been a great film had it not been for the unlikely relationship between Layla (Ricci) and Billy Brown, as well as the slightly messed editing and an overly abrupt transformation of Brown's mentality at the end of the film. The message of the film, despite the film's appearance, is actually pretty healthy. It has a lot to say about the pointlessness of revenge, but even that as well as some fascinating camera work in the strip club at the end of the movie are not enough to save this film from cinematic obscurity. This is the type of film that you watch to study different writing and directing styles, you don't watch something like this to enjoy it.",Buffalo '66
16,robfollower,Buffalo '66 (1998) classification avant-garde,9,29 August 2020,"This movie is pure art, plain and simple. Even if the movie might not be to your taste (a lot of people don't like this film at all, and they find it boring and meaningless). Hopefully one can agree it is really nice to know that there was once a time and place when American Independent Cinema really had a heart and soul and it is in full exhibition here. Classification avant-garde.Vincent Gallo wrote the story and screen play, directed the film, and was the main star. Vincent Gallo fresh out of a five-year prison stint who really needs to take a leak but can't find a bathroom anywhere.Easily one of the best contemporary actresses ever, Christina Ricci (who plays Layla), enters and is literally kidnapped by Vincent's character. This happens realistically, with a dark sense of humor-- (in a building where he almost finds a toilet), brings her to his family and poses her as his wife. We then get a wonderful half-hour of the biggest generation gap in history in which Gallo, Ricci and his parents, Angelica Huston and Ben Gazzara, have the most complicated anti-bonding dinner in history.This indie gem is downright brilliant with wonderful imagery, antique film stock, strategically placed camera-angles and split screens that all work to embody the dreamlike... or rather... nightmarish quality. Also, needing to be mentioned it the soundtrack of this movie which personally I believe to be among the best, featuring original music from writer, director and star Vincent Gallo as well as prog-rock artists like Yes and King Crimson. Buffalo '66 is an exceptional film IMO.Interesting cinematography note: Buffalo '66 was shot on a Reversal stock that the NFL used to use to film games back in the 1970s. It was out of production and Gallo's production gathered all they could to shoot the film and give it it's gorgeous wintery palette.In real life : Ricci and Gallo did not fancy one another.Model, actor-director and sometimes singer Vincent Gallo has a very good memory ... and very, very loose lips to match. Gallo, who wrote, directed and starred in the darling indie film ""Buffalo 66"" in 1998, has reportedly talked smack about Christina Ricci, his co-star in the film, to a New York Post Page Six columnist, according to a Mr. Showbiz report.Gallo: ""It was OK when she wasn't drunk on the set. I think she's an alcoholic -- it was either that, or she was on cough syrup the whole time,"" Gallo allegedly said about Ricci.Hold on, it gets better/worse .""I don't like her,"" Gallo reportedly blabbered on. ""She's an ungrateful c***. But it was OK. She's basically a puppet. I told her what to do, and she did it.""And better/worse.""She lost 17 pounds, and that was because I only let her eat one whole pizza pie every day,"" he said.And this was Ricci's response in an interview from 2007 (questions bolded this time):Quote:
It's ten years since you made 'Buffalo 66' with Vincent Gallo.I was seventeen, yeah. It was my first movie away without my mother. Not a wise choice. I really didn't understand what was going on most of the time working with a crazy lunatic man. I'd never encountered such insanity.He said some nice things about your weight.Oh yes, I've been there. Horrible things. He waited three or four years and then decided to make fun of my weight at the time that we were shooting 'Buffalo 66'. He waited that long to make fun of a seventeen-year-old. It's so bizarre, and I hadn't seen him in years, I hadn't done anything to him. It was just like: okay, a. s . s hole.Did you get on with him when making the film?No, not really. He's one of those people who sometimes he's so nice to you and then the next he imagines that you've done something horrible and he'll start screaming at you. It's difficult to get on well with someone like that.Did you see his next film, 'The Brown Bunny'?
Oh, I didn't see it. I have no interest in seeing anything he ever does again.",Buffalo '66
17,jimbo-53-186511,Good acting and direction can't hide what is ultimately a hollow film,2,24 July 2013,"I'm totally shocked that at the time of writing this review that this film has an average IMDb user rating of 7.3. Huh?? I really can't understand what the majority of people see in this film. Basically, Billy Brown (Gallo) is released from jail for a crime he didn't commit and is intent on getting revenge on the person responsible for putting him in jail. Before he sets out on getting his vengeance, he kidnaps Layla (Ricci) after telling his parents that she is his wife - this is something that he had been lying to them about whilst he was inside. He persuades Layla to go along with his lie and tell them how brilliant he is and how much she loves him etc. After this unnecessary filler, we get a little plot development as Billy makes a call to his prison friend called Goon to try and track down the whereabouts of the person he holds responsible for him being sent to prison. The rest of the film is basically Billy trying to track down the person he holds responsible for him being sent to prison.The main problems with Buffalo 66 (and believe me there are many) is that there are too many things that didn't make any sense or that weren't believable, Like what was the purpose of taking Layla back to his parents house? They didn't stay there, they didn't go there for money. Billy seemed to want them to think he had a wife for some reason. Also Layla had many opportunities to escape from Billy, but chose not to - this is a man that threatened her and was generally nasty to her, but yet she didn't want to leave him. Perhaps this is because she was a bit naive and perhaps she felt she could change him etc, but to me it all seemed a bit phony.The main plot itself was also quite absurd. In a nutshell, Billy bet $10,000 on the Buffalos winning a Superbowl game, but the game is lost due to a missed kick by Scott Woods. Therefore Billy loses the bet, but doesn't have the $10,000 dollars to pay the bookie. So the bookie (played with icy coolness by Mickey Rourke in the 5 minutes or so that he was on screen) tells Billy that the only way he can settle his debt is to testify to a crime that he didn't commit and let the guilty party go free - which he does and gets sentenced to 5 years. He then seeks revenge on Woods for missing the kick and making him lose the bet and for losing 5 years of his life in jail - he also believes that Woods was paid to throw the game. OK - a couple of things; 1) Billy shouldn't have bet $10,000 dollars if he didn't have the money to lose. 2) Why would he only target Woods when Rourke's character was ultimately responsible for sending him to jail? The above reasons make the whole revenge element seem rather flawed.Aside from script issues, the film was also boring and just seemed to drag on and there were many instances where there was just dialogue (most of which was uninteresting) with little to no plot development. The film also lacked any kind of suspense or tension. Also what was the need in Gallo repeating nearly every sentence twice? I realise that this can make characters seem menacing (which it does to an extent), but not in every single sentence - that to me was just overkill.The only positives I can really draw from Buffalo 66 was Gallo's performance (apart from when he was saying his sentences twice). He has a naturally menacing look about him and that helped in making him come across as 'convincing' in his role. Ricci was also good as his 'naive' pretend wife - she was really good at portraying a 'naive' innocent woman who wanted to do all she could to try and appease Billy. The direction and camera work were also pretty good (particularly towards the start of the film).I may have slightly forgiven the dodgy script and mind numbingly boring majority of the film if it would have at least had a good ending, but Gallo doesn't even manage to get that right. I understand the point that Gallo was trying to make about 'choices' but to me Billy's U-turn came out of nowhere and seemingly without any reason - considering how obnoxious he was throughout the entirety of the film.This was an astoundingly bad film which was only saved slightly by the 2 lead performances and fairly good direction, but I still wouldn't waste your time watching it.",Buffalo '66
18,dwpollar,Well-done and unusually styled story...,9,21 March 2001,1st watched 12/11/1999 - 9 out of 10(Dir-Vincent Gallo): Well-done and unusually styled story of a young man trying to do something right in his messed up life.Nothing like this could come out of Hollywood - a personal story about an average guy with many problems who is looking for what all of us are(someone who truly loves & cares for him.)He finds his person finally in the end after a lot of rough stops along the way.,Buffalo '66
19,rooprect,Possibly the best revenge story ever written,10,12 July 2010,"I saw this movie when it was released & absolutely loved it. After years, I finally got a copy last week, watched it again and realized my initial reaction was an underreaction. This film is nothing short of phenomenal.""Buffalo '66"" is a well-crafted story which despite its simplicity packs a whollop. The plot can be summed up in 1 phrase: ""a day in the life of a schmuck"". But, much like ""Catcher in the Rye"" (or ""3 days in the life of a schmuck""), it takes you on some bizarre twists & very introspective moments. If you've ever felt a disconnection with the world, even for just a moment sitting in a Dennys in the middle of the night having a Holden Caufield moment, then this movie will really hit the mark.You can choose to enjoy this film on 3 levels, each of which will give you more than your money's worth. (1) You can watch it simply as a deadpan comedy--one of the best in its class. (2) You can watch it on a philosophical level--we'll get to that later. Or (3) you can watch it on a purely technical level & enjoy the bold, outrageous & audaciously original camera techniques that only a rookie director could come up with.(1) Deadpan comedy. If you enjoy comedies like Catch-22 or the Christopher Guest films (Spinal Tap, Waiting for Guffman, Best in Show) then I think this will be right up your alley. Be forewarned it's very subtle, and due to the lead character (played by Gallo) being so thoroughly unlikeable, you have to understand the absurdity of the situation before you realize it's all tongue-in-cheek, but the payoff is LOL all the way.(2) Philosophical level. Ahh, here lies the strength of this film. Without ruining anything, I'll just tell you it's a revenge story, and the outcome is both unexpected and perfect. There have been many stories written about revenge and the strange human obsession over it: Edgar Allen Poe's ""Cask of Amontillado"", Peter Shaffer's ""Amadeus"", Mary Shelley's ""Frankenstein""... the best stories approach the subject in a very personal & original way, as if the writer himself/herself feels every ounce of fury & pain involved. In the centuries to come, it wouldn't surprise me one bit if ""Buffalo 66"" is added to the list of great revenge stories. On top of it all, it's a comedy. How cool is that!(3) Technical level. I'm no film expert, but I've seen enough movies to know when a director is doing some amazing things. There are scenes that will bend your perception of reality, scenes that will make you feel cold, scenes that will get your blood racing ...even a scene that'll make you want to run to the bathroom & take a pee. And it's all magnified by a careful & deliberate approach to cinematography. Most of all, there are camera shots that are just plain funny, like the memorable dinner scene where the camera keeps changing point-of-view between the 4 places at the table. Simple, original & outrageous, that's what you'll get. Nothing pretentious like a Godard wannabe trying to impress you with camera techniques, but just good old fashioned, creative thinking. Watch for it. Also watch for the climactic scene which does a Matrix-like ""bullet time effect"", but realize that Buffalo 66 was released a year before the Matrix and also that Vincent Gallo did it with a single camera (instead of 120 like the Matrix used).Oh, one last thing. I have to mention the excellent soundtrack with music by King Crimson (""Moonchild""), Yes (""Sweetness"" & ""Heart of the Sunrise"" in the greatest climax ever) as well as Vincent Gallo's own contributions. While music is sparse throughout the film, it's extremely effective when used.In all, I give this movie 10 enthusiastic stars which is something I don't often do. Now go watch it, then hop a bus to Buffalo NY and buy a heart cookie for your girlfriend (watch the movie & it'll make sense).",Buffalo '66

Yet, somehow in this ridiculous scenario, I find myself able to relate to some of these characters. The psychology of Billy is fascinating and yet somehow familiar.This movie isn't bad, but with the subject matter I feel like it should be?

The camera work is near-perfect and fits the tone of the story. At times it can get quite experimental, which of course is the nice thing about independent movies, you can try some different things. You don't have any money for any of them, but you can still try them. Gallo himself gives a beautiful performance of the introvert man with the suppressed rage. The casting of Christina Ricci is perfect. Lots of stuff in this movie is perfect. There's a plot, but it's really not that important. There's this guy who bet on Buffalo, lost and now wants revenge on the guy that screwed up years ago, who has developed a taste for strippers.

Every other character is either despicable or tragic. Billy Brown's situation is pitiful and he's downright loathsome about it. For a first feature, this should be a mess. But Gallo had an energy and urgency in telling this story. Most first time filmmakers don't have this. It's the kind of energy that rode the coattails of Tarantino and other film brats of the time. It's sad to know that Gallo's insecurities led him down a self-destructive path in the years that followed.",Buffalo '66
23,gbheron,Gallo Tries Too Hard,6,20 February 2001,"""Buffalo '66"", Vincent Gallo's freshman outing as director, is a close miss. It has a lot going for it. The film has a decent, quirky, albeit depressing, story to tell about a recently released young convict returning to hearth and home in working class Buffalo. There he is reunited with an extremely dysfunctional family and set of friends. To impress his family, he kidnaps a young woman to stand in as his wife. It seems he has told them that he has not been in prison for five years, but has been away on a secret government assignment.  I digress. To act in this offbeat story Gallo has a commendable ensemble cast. They do very well, especially Christina Ricci. He also gets points for filming on location in wintertime Buffalo. Bravo! What knocks down ""Buffalo '66"" is the direction. Gallo tries to hard, employing an overabundance of New Wave, artsy-fartsy stuff. It distracts from the film and gets in the way of the storytelling. This movie's not bad, just not that good.",Buffalo '66
24,TOMASBBloodhound,"Tedious, and that's putting it politely.",2,28 December 2007,"What is it with some ""indie"" filmmakers, anyway? I too get terribly bored with mainstream Hollywood fare from time to time, but that doesn't mean I'll happily sit through nearly two hours of crap for something different. Buffalo '66 sounds like it will be an interesting and off-beat film when you read the general plot outline. Unfortunately, the film is very boring and there just isn't much to warrant its lengthy running time.Writer/director Vincent Gallo plays a guy named Billy Brown. Billy is released from prison in the film's opening scene. He had been sent there for confessing to a crime he did not commit in order to pay off a gambling debt from a lost football game. Now that he's out, Billy plans to return to Buffalo and kill the field goal kicker whose missed kick cost him the bet, as well as all that lost time. Billy spends nearly the first fifteen minutes of the film searching for a bathroom. Yes, his need to urinate is a major plot point in the early part of the film! Finally finding one inside a dance studio, Billy ends up kidnapping a young girl from a tap dancing class and getting her to pose as his wife when he goes to meet his parents. After an awkward half hour or so at his old house, we then see Billy take his new ""bride"" to a bowling alley, and then they rent a motel room together. The final ten minutes or so deal with Billy confronting the ex-kicker inside a strip club he now operates. The conclusion is actually one of the better points of the film.Honestly we had about enough material here for one hour of running time. So little happens in this film, that's it's incredible considering how long it lasts. The acting is okay. Gallo is whiny and creepy-looking, but the man does have a screen presence. Christina Ricci is nice to look at, but she's really just there for scenery purposes. Ben Gazzara and Angelica Houston seem lost within their annoying characters. Gazzara almost looks like he can't believe he's in a film like this. Gallo uses a lot of inserts of other images into the main frame of his shots. This certainly helps capture the time period of the film's title, but since the film does not take place in 1966, one wonders why he did it this way at all.Don't let the high rating this film is getting fool you. This is a boring film. Even die hard film school types will find themselves daydreaming after the first twenty minutes. But they still will give it high ratings to act like they ""got it"". As for myself, I got it just fine. And it's still only worth about 2 stars to the Hound.2 of 10.",Buffalo '66
25,ofpsmith,A blueprint for a low budget film.,10,16 March 2020,"Buffalo '66 seems like a very rare kind of film. It somehow manages to work as both a comedy (sort of), a drama, and a romance movie all at once. Billy Brown (Vincent Gallo) has been released from prison for a crime he did not commit. He returns home to Buffalo, New York where he kidnaps Layla (Christina Ricci) whom he has pretend to be his wife as Billy has lied to his parents about being married. After a tense and argumentative reunion between Billy and his neglectful parents he and Layla leave. Layla stays with him through the night even though she no longer has to. As she learns more about him and spends more time with Billy she starts to fall in love with him for what he is. This is a pretty difficult romantic angle to pull off (given the fact that Billy kidnapped Layla) but the film made me believe it. Likewise the acting from virtually everyone was fantastic. The fact that the film was made this competently for only a $1,000,000 budget ought to cement it as an example of how independent movies should be made.",Buffalo '66

It didn't take me long to get hooked on this film, thanks to some cold and gray visuals and somber music in the opening minutes.  The film is further helped by a number of great performances, especially by Gallo and Ricci.  Ricci's character was just so unique that it kept things unconventional, and so most of the kidnapping cliches are therefore avoided.  But my favourite part of the film really was Gallo.  Yes, his character is pretty dim, and really, he's a loser, but once his parents are introduced, I couldn't help but feel some sympathy for him.  Quite simply, this movie has a great story, some terrific acting, and it was made in a highly creative way.  In other words, this is a must-see motion picture.",Buffalo '66

Both Vincent Gallo and Christina Ricci did a fine job, as did Ben Gazzara and Anjelica Houston. I guess it's one of those films that's more about the inner workings of the mind; you find yourself asking what is the motivation behind Billy's actions and what exactly does Layla see in him? I have to admit at first I really didn't like the character of Billy, but he grew on me as I came to understand him more.

And miss Ricci tryin' to be a white angel in this messy life. This is an American movie! Not a Hollywood movie : an American movie. When I want to see what's creative in the USA, I had to look at movies of that kind, not to the other kind. I really love the sequence where Billy is at home with his parents. The TV is always on and keeps attractions. This is just like...mmmmm, at my home! (Sorry mom and dad.

It represents the dreary environment of a nearly Midwestern city - Buffalo, New York. Vincent Gallo is very good as a jaded male, who drifts his life away. His character is just released from prison, and there is a hysterical scene where he runs all over downtown Buffalo looking for a restroom. Then, he brings a young woman, played by Christine Ricci, to meet his crazy parents. His parents are uncannily like so many blue-collar urban parents. They spend all their time rooting for the Buffalo Bills, and, otherwise, are very conventional. Gallo's character's big success was as a bowler. You see the localism, and that he is still the local boy. He has his own locker and a picture of him at the bowling alley, despite having been in jail for the past five years. He has a crazy plan of knocking off a Buffalo Bills kicker whom he believes ruined his life. Ricci is very good as a sweet girl, who persists.

It doesn't make a bit of sense to me. He is abusive to her. She seems like a sweet girl without the sort of emotional hangups to tolerate the abuse of someone like Billy. Billy is a horrible person- egotistical and abusive. The script, to me, doesn't make a plausible case that Layla would stay with Billy. We don't know enough of her background to believe that she would tolerate such abuse and bad treatment. He kidnaps her. He berates her for being TOO good at giving a good impression of him. He is jealous of her involvement with guys before she'd even met him. Why she stays with him is a bit of a mystery. This is one of the major shortcomings of the movie. It's hard to believe that someone would tolerate such unsolicited treatment. If we knew a bit more about her background, we might find her acceptance of him more understandable. All that said however, for whatever reason, she does stay with him and there is the suggestion of love at the end of the movie. This makes the movie magical and really a little sentimental. It's ultimately a love story for hipsters. I can't trash this movie because I'm not cynical enough to do that. It is a sweet movie at heart and it is as though Gallo dares us to not like Billy. Well, I don't like him, but if someone does, then I wish he and the girl all the luck in the world.",Buffalo '66

The scenes at his parents house where they so obviously don't care about him and the flashbacks that show how his character have been formed are the highlight.But the fact that this pathetic creature lets him drag her around, belittle, abuse and mistreat her is so utterly DISTURBING it ruined the entire film for me. I kept waiting for her to run away, fight back or even maybe kill him/get him back to jail. Instead she falls for him? Why? Is she just as pathetic and starved for love? Has he done ANYTHING remotely to endear himself to her other than show how deeply pathetic he is (in between bouts of abuse).

Billy is also on a mission to kill Scott Wood, a former kicker for the Bills football team, who missed a game-winning field goal (remember Superbowl XXV, only it was Scott Norwood, nice delicate change there) which cost Billy his freedom in a wager with a shady betting shark (brief cameo from Mickey Rourke). Billy then takes us to his local haunts, in the bowling alley where we meet the seldom seen nowadays Jan Michael Vincent in a small role, and also to a diner where he comes across an old college friend, Rosanna Arquette, who reveals some secrets about Billy.

42,flickershows,"Gallo & Ricci In A Love That ""Spans Time""",7,2 July 2005,"'Buffalo 66' is a strange (and sometimes funny) little movie. It's grubby-looking and the plotlessness sometimes feels like aimlessness, but there are some hilarious highlights. Writer/director/composer/star Vincent Gallo proves that repeating a line can make it funnier and funnier. While sitting in one of those two-dollar photo booths with an uncooperative Christina Ricci, Gallo keeps saying that he wants the picture to show a love that ""spans time"". She's not to touch him, but their love spans time. And it keeps going like that until he's happy. I can't do the scene justice. Trust me, it's really funny.And this all takes place only hours after he's kidnapped her! She doesn't seem to mind being a hostage, though, and he's too depressed to be one of those ""you're dead if you scream"" kidnappers. Gallo is Billy Brown, a youngish malcontent fresh out of jail after serving time for a crime he had nothing to do with and now wants revenge on the Buffalo Bills' place-kicker he blames for putting him there. He snatches Ricci and wants her to masquerade as his wife, simply to impress his indifferent parents. Anjelica Huston is his football-loving mom and Ben Gazzara is his ravenous old man. They meet their ""daughter in law"", they like her, they mostly ignore Billy, and then the newlyweds move on to other experiences that are both mundane and fascinating.Reminiscent of a collection of scenes you might see during an Actor's Studio workshop, 'Buffalo 66' is a mannered piece of unpredictability. I kept thinking of 'Stranger Than Paradise'. Neither film makes a compelling argument for a second viewing, but they're both quirky pictures that dare to move at their own pace. Gallo risks being pretentious (or even boring), but 'Buffalo 66' works. There's even a resolution to the place-kicker tangent. And if nothing else, there's that scene in the photo booth. It gets funnier as it plays out and it's a minor miracle that Ricci didn't lose it & start laughing. I know I did.",Buffalo '66
43,jtur88,Gallo may be an Aspie,9,10 March 2005,"Viewers who characterized Gallo's ""Billy Brown"" as an improbable personality may wish to use their search engine and check out ""Asperger's Syndrome"". As an Aspie myself, I saw many indicators in this film that Billy has this disorder, which in those times was probably mis-diagnosed as Attention Deficit Disorder. Upon reading IMDb's biog of Gallo, I see even more clues that Gallo (portraying his own life in this film) might be an Aspie.Asperger's is a poorly understood condition, because most people who have it exhibit only some, but not all of its typical characteristics. In Billy's case, repeating the ""spanning time"" theme over and over again (called ""perseveration"") is classic. Another common personality trait is to have a strong desire to be involved in a romantic relationship, but nearly always failing because of a poor capacity to understand how to make a relationship work. Aspies very often bond strongly with a few individuals, but otherwise feel very uncomfortable in any social situation. They need everything spelled out in detail, and lack the ability to read body language or catch subtleties or nuances, so attempts to be sociable generally crash.So, before dismissing ""Buffalo '66"" on the basis that ""How could anybody really be like that"", Asperger's Syndrome ought to be your bedtime reading.",Buffalo '66

They do, I admit, provide the best moments in the film, but that's not saying much. First of all, the premise is extremely unappealing:  get a girlfriend by way of kidnapping, hope Stockholm Syndrome kicks in, then stir.  I know, fans of this film will try and tell me there's more to it than that, and there is, but the what's ""more to it"" is equally unappealing, or just plain boring.  I kept hoping for it to get better (as I watched a few people walk out).  I have also had people argue with me that the strip club scenes were not gratuitous.  Well, after reviewing this film in print I watched it again to appease those comments, and I still found nothing redeeming in the scenes.  Gallo wanted to film breasts, period.  I should also point out that I knew nothing about the filmmaker and had no previous bias against him before seeing this, and actually liked Christina Ricci up to that point.  I gave it a chance.

Vincent Gallo has put together an excellent character study set against the grimy, subfusc background of his home town.
Christina Ricci deserves the near-unanimous praise she has received for her eminently appealing, understated portrayal of a cooperative kidnaping victim. The spectrum of expressions that chase across her lovely heart-shaped face in the photo booth is especially memorable. This is not to take anything away from Gallo's acting though. His rhythmic, repetitious remonstrations are quite addictive, and I have since found it difficult to keep from imitating his verbal style while dealing with people at work. Ben Gazzara and Angelica Huston are also outstanding as parents in a family so dysfunctional it makes the subjects of AMERICAN BEAUTY look like something out of the Donna Reid Show. A nearly unrecognizable Mickey Rourke shows up in a great cameo as a bookie.Fans of local color will also like BUFFALO '66. Gallo has a similar eye for his old stomping grounds that the Coen brothers did for theirs in FARGO, but Gallo's execution is more subtle and at least as rewarding.Bottom line: just stick with it through the opening scene, and you'll find gold here.",Buffalo '66

48,LuckyFour-LeafClover,Abrasive personality aside...,10,9 August 2020,Vincent Gallo I've always thought was an interesting guy. He's a guy not afraid to speak his mind offering up very un pc talk and not afraid to bash anyone. An unabashed staunt Republican who works in Hollywood. Although sometimes I have to wonder if a lot of it's tongue in cheek.I only introduce him that way as I think a lot of people don't really look at his art only him and I think that's unfair. It could be a lot of the reason he's sort of faded out over the years.In this movie Vincent plays Billy Brown an ex-con whose forced to do 5 years in jail for losing a bet on the Bills winning the Super Bowl. He didn't have the money to pay up so he took the fall for another criminal. So the movie revolves around him trying to get revenge on Scott Wood based on Scott Norwood.Once he gets out of jail he kidnaps Christina Ricci's character to visit his parents. This is where the film gets interesting as the character of Billy begins to soften a bit and we understand why he is the way he is. His parents cared more about the Bills than their child. Rosanna Arquette has a very memorable cameo as well.Overall a great film with a great soundtrack by Yes. And interestingly enough that was Gallo's childhood home on display.,Buffalo '66
49,birck,"Low budget, sleazy-looking, repulsive, and genuine",8,19 October 2015,"I saw the original preview for this film in 1998 and never forgot the strange main character. I finally figured out what film I was looking for and watched it on Amazon. Thanks to Gallo, a great cast, and a good script, it really is a good film. A character study of a marginal personality-a guy who is barely able to hold it together, who meets a young woman who sees through his off-putting facade and really wants to get to know him, in spite of his twisted family history and repulsive mannerisms. The fact that Vincent Gallo was able to corral the excellent cast he did to fill out the story must be a tribute to the quality of his script. There are no clichés in it. It is one of a kind. It's ironic that a script of this quality can attract good actors, but not the money to make a more polished film. On the other hand, the basic, workmanlike production suits the story and the locale-down-and-out Buffalo, populated with characters that work perfectly in this story.",Buffalo '66

For start, some scenes were just so plain and monotone. And because of this, here comes the second problem - it was so boring at moments that I didn't notice any comedy, I don't know why it's written that this is one of the genres.

52,RJBose,Quirky and compelling; it's worth a look.,7,21 February 1999,"Compared with many of today's movies which have production budgets the size of a small Latin America nation's GDP, Buffalo '66 was made on the cheap.  That low rent quality, however, is another of the components of this quirky, unconventional, yet inevitably compelling presentation.This story, and the main character of ""Billy Brown"" reminded me of ""The Big Lebowski"" in that the central character is a well-intentioned loser, and the story emanates from the interaction of the bizarre characters with whom he interacts; (ironically, bowling figures prominently in both stories and characterizations).Assuming that any reader of these comments will be familiar with the general story, the hours immediately following the release of Mr. Brown from incarceration, and featuring a visit to his parents' house to introduce them to the wife he has written about while maintaining a cover for his five year absence, I will not go into any detail rather than to make the observation that the Christina Ricci character (forced into portraying his adoring wife) might have been developed a bit further to explain why she would be so sympathetic to Billy and his circumstances.  (Given several opportunities to escape early on, just why does she stay?)The portrayal of Billy's wretched existence as shown through his psychotic family's life, at the dinner, and through flashbacks, is almost disturbing enough to cause a viewer to flee to more pleasant diversions. For what is is, though, it is quite masterfully put together, and there are moments of genuine humor.This is not a ""date movie"" or a conventional comedy, and there are some unpleasant scenes in the way of violent behavior, but as an alternative to mass produced and over-marketed general Hollywood fare, Buffalo '66 is worth a look, and might offer a few things to think about.(For those interested in the development of Miss Ricci as an actress and as a young woman, she gives a very good performance as a wayward teen from a tap-dancing class, and has developed considerably physically from her days as Wednesday Adams.  She is a bit on the chubby side and is fully clothed throughout the film).",Buffalo '66

54,shrine-2,Sometimes caring matters,5,21 December 1999,"There's a sullen indifference about how onlookers might feel about Billy Brown that some people might regard as daring or brave or unflinchingly honest, but I'm sure there are others who feel as I do that Vincent Gallo's creation is unsettling and self-indulgent.  Even at the end, when Brown decides not to avenge himself, you get the feeling that after the titles are done rolling, he'll be back in that strip joint, finishing the job he set out to do in the first place.  Gallo has a sophisticated visual sense, and he has accomplished something I thought no one could:  get Christina Ricci to play someone who believes in someone or something with anything resembling passion.  Her character is an enigma; why a woman in her right mind would put up with Billy Brown's craziness requires a lot more explaining than the writer/director furnishes.  Yet she does, and the movie should whirl with wonder over Brown's dog luck at having found someone like her.  But on that point--love and forbearance changing one's outlook on life--the movie offers leftover baked goods; it remains earthbound.And I'm sorry, but I am personally passed the point of blaming my parents for my own lunacy; I would have thought that Gallo might find a more sophisticated reason for Billy's.  Even with a $300,000 budget, you hope, with some of the accolades this movie is drawing, the moment that Ben Gazzara is given to sing would be dazzling instead of pathetic.  And a movie couldn't be all that good when it hands an actress with the stature of Anjelica Huston a role in which she gives what is the worst performance of her career.Maybe it's courage that motivates Gallo to play out his story without apology, but it leaves this movie as frozen as that fantastic dream shot he creates. It's for a split second compelling, but hard to cherish.  Sometimes showing people you care about what they think gives a movie the resonance they can carry with them always. It provides the necessary heat the screen needs to capture the imagination. Sometimes caring matters.",Buffalo '66
55,charlietuna,The Vincent Gallo Show,7,3 September 2001,"A quick blurb about a project that I thought was successful for the most part.  The two reviewers below, captured the main faults with Mr. Gallo's effort.  I would only add that I didn't get the impression from either of their comments that they felt they were viewing a comedy.  Perhaps reliance on the satirical nature of things is my own form of denial when it comes to salvaging enjoyment from so many modern films.  After all, I found ""Fight Club"" extremely enjoyable purely because it was an obvious satire, whose punch line alluded a surprising amount of critics.  Similarly here, it is a valid criticism to find this film painfully solipsist.  It is also a cogent criticism to find the other characters particularly Ricci's, to be underdeveloped to the point of being lifeless.  However, in my viewing this WAS the point.  This is an extremely dark comedy about a dysfunctional man, from a dysfunctional family, living in a dysfunctional world.  My main complaint was Gallo didn't have the good sense to end the movie after the shootout montage.  This is where the film was headed and was its logical end point.  Where the film ultimately ends up was either satire ad absurdom or some sick effort to get this movie out off the art house circuit.

56,larrysmile1,A Surprisingly Outstanding Story and Film,9,28 January 2007,"""Buffalo '66"" is a different kind of low budget film. It is the kind of film that most high budget films should attempt to emulate!Tons of congratulations to Vincent Gallo. He wrote the story and screen play, directed the film, and was the main star. People are always told to write what they know something about. It is true. Vincent wrote about Buffalo, New York, where he was born and raised. He even used the same house he grew up in as well as local places in Buffalo for his scenic backgrounds. I hear that the budget for this film was only $1.5 million dollars. It proves that a good story with good writing and actors who are intensely dedicated to their craft can surpass even the most expensive movie that is lacking in telling a meaningful story.I won't retell the story as enough has already been written about it. Vincent Gallo did a great job in his role as Billy Brown. Christina Ricci plays a wonderful low-keyed costarring role as Layla. I was pleasantly surprised to see Rosanna Arquette appear in a small role as Billy Brown's school heartthrob, Wendy Balsam. Look for her to appear in the scene at Denny's Restaurant. Anjelica Huston was wonderful as the disinterested mother, Jan Brown, who seems to have spent her life adoring the Buffalo Bills football team instead of being a loving mother. Ben Gazzara played his mean and overbearing father, Jimmy Brown. One actor who should have received film credit is Billy's only friend, Rocky the Goon played by Kevin Corrigan. Kevin was excellent in his role. Other notable surprises in this film are appearances by Mickey Rourke, Jan-Michael Vincent, Kevin Pollak, and Alex Karras. A number of small role performers seem to be local Buffalo citizens doing small one-liner parts as the film progresses around the City of Buffalo. A good move on director Vincent Gallo's part because using local citizens in speaking roles assures that the script is believable and natural. Regardless of the comments Vincent Gallo made about himself in his trivia section of his Internet Movie Database I think he deserves credit for bringing this film to the attention of the movie world. I would hope that Roger Ebert selects this film for one of his Overlooked Film Festival viewings. The film is that good.",Buffalo '66
57,MovieMan-112,Original....Clever....Effective Film-Making!,10,26 August 1999,"""Buffalo 66"" is one of the strangest films I have ever seen. It's not only the strange plot (ex-con kidnaps a teenage girl to pose as his wife for his mentally unstable parents) that makes a mark in the ""strange"" category, but also the style of film-making that Gallo himself has created and used for the movie (the fade-ins and fade-outs in boxes with a creepy soundtrack accompanying them) that succeed as a landmark in originality. The story also works and the actors are magnificent from Gallo himself as paranoid Billy Brown who is permanently disturbed with low self esteem and pointless obsession to Ben Gazzara and Angelica Houston as his insane parents. Every character, major and minor, are wonderful. Buffalo 66 proves that you don't need great special effects and a complicated plotline to have a good movie....just originality and a good cast of characters. CAST! CAST! CAST! The ending is one of the most disturbing ones ever seen in a movie, which is only on a re-edited version and not on the home-video release. The home-video version has somewhat of a vague and shallow ending that really kills the mood of the movie and hurts the film a lot when it comes to brilliance and wit. The home video version I rate * * 1/2 stars (out of 4) and the re-edited version in which Gallo finishes what he initially intended to do for years gets * * * * (out of 4). A great film indeed.",Buffalo '66

61,organicsocial,Complex like the human mind: An Uplifting story about an Upset man,10,3 June 2009,"The characters are so much like real people I have seen so often, all the outrageous behavior and insanity. Finding love in the times of moral depravation is a constant theme and it is fairly established that Billy has had a tormented childhood. He has grown up to become a very sentimental and emotional person in spite of his parents being uninterested and disconnected up to the point that the family seems severely dysfunctional. Contributing much to the introvert and overtly acidic nature of Billy. It is quite understandable. As to why Layla(Ricci) seems so jaded and emotionally unaffected, is not explained but it could be due to her bleak and isolated environment. The way she never tries to run away or raise an alarm when she has a chance, even though she is being abducted makes me feel that she somewhat needed to be rescued herself from the boring life she was in. In a way she wanted it to happen or she just started enjoying it. The Camera work is just brilliant, the perspective angles of view while Billy, his parents and Layla are having lunch is something I would forever remember. The memories and flashback are something that makes this movie go forward but in a very distinctive way. A benevolent but pushed down friend(Goon) and that he is always sleeping in his briefs whenever Billy calls him, Houston's performance of Billy's football fanatic mom and his foolish desperate act that landed him in jail at the first place are all hilarious and seem commonplace enough to be convincing. The heart shaped cookie and hot chocolate scene makes the movie almost cute. Ricci is one of my favourite actresses and she is one of those rare actors who can tell it all through their eyes. The movie never fails to satisfy my imagination. At the end the sudden reversal of Billy is just coming of age. There may be a few proponents of an alternate ending where Billy kills wood and himself out of years old hatred. That would have made the movie shocking but it would have had no hope. So the ending couldn't have been better. Vincent Gallo's performance is amazingly erratic and a good study for theatrical purposes.

I detested it.",5,20 August 2001,"It's films like this one - and the astonishingly mixed reviews it's garnered - that remind me how completely subjective this business is.  I don't think I've ever enjoyed a film as little as Buffalo 66; I found it a perpetual struggle to watch, and only stayed to the end out of stubbornness, and a hope that there might be some sort of moment of revelation somewhere along the line.  Yet I can't really say that this is a BAD film, much as I loathed it: it's well directed, has a terrific cast, Billy's dialogue has a certain compelling, desperate rhythm to it at times, and its grimy, downtrodden locations are extremely well chosen.  My dislike of it was, I think, dislike of Vincent Gallo himself in an oddly personal way: here is a protagonist who is not just without a redeeming feature (that I can cope with) but without a single interesting feature, and Gallo seems convinced that he's a full-blown hero of romantic alienation.  Perhaps the film is more ironic than I think - but I don't think so, it seems completely self-absorbed and solipsistic, yet the self into which it's absorbed simply isn't one with whom I want to spent five minutes. It doesn't surprise me that Gallo originally completed a screenplay for this film a full decade before he made it, because this strikes me as fundamentally adolescent posturing, which is going to be appreciated primarily by young men who are in the adolescent-posturing stage themselves - aged eighteen it's possible I'd have found this a thrilling exercise in self-justification. Now I'm a few years past that (reader, condolences are welcome) I simply found myself infuriated by his self-importance. In particular, the way the film exploits its meaningless, nugatory fantasy woman, Layla, is pretty revolting. I can sort of see why Christina Ricci was tempted to play it, because the sheer absence of a character in the character she was playing is both a challenge and a sort of liberation for an actor, but it's still an absolute dog's breakfast of a role.  Ricci herself is always worth watching, and there are flashes of brilliance from her and the rest of the cast.

Vincent Gallo plays the auteur here as writer/director/actor, with stunning results. The film has a look to it that places it aesthetically amongst the great American films of the late sixties and early seventies - using a grainy, primary-colour palette. As well, Gallo pulls out all the stops with various optical effects such as square-iris transitions and frames-within-frames. The acting is subtly brilliant, with Gallo playing a likable low-life and Christina Ricci in a brilliant turn as a teenage moll. Ben Gazarra and Anjelica Huston are hilarious as Gallo's dysfunctional-household parents. Owing a nod to Jim Jarmusch's goofily bland environments, Gallo portrays the backdrop of Buffalo as a realer-than-real world of everyday people who tread the fine line between the mundane and kitschy. It's a rare treat to see scenes set in bus stations, empty bowling alleys and Denny's restaurants. I'm probably not doing the film justice on the page. Ultimately, it's a visual experience.

70,ShanTeaTime,Buffalo Deserves Better Films Of Representation,3,2 November 2019,"""Buffalo '66"" is a 1998 film directed, written and starring Vincent Gallo in his full-length feature debut. The plot goes as follows. After being released from prison, Billy is set to visit his parents with his wife, whom he does not actually have. This provokes Billy to act out, as he kidnaps a girl (Ricci) and forces her to act as his wife for the visit.Let me put a disclaimer that I did not enjoy this film. I had to watch it for my filmic text class and seeing as it's based in Buffalo (my home city) my professor thought it would stir up some interesting conversation. Oh boy did it, many students in my class did not like this film either some more so than me. Gallo is essentially portraying himself in this main character (do your research and you'll see what I mean) and managed to make one of the most unlikable main characters I've ever seen in film. He's got no redeemable qualities, his ""redemption"" arch doesn't even happen until the last minute of the movie. Honestly, if Billy had died like in his daydream it would've made the movie more tolerable.Billy is the embodiment of toxic masculinity. He's violent, homophobic, manipulative, verbally volatile and just plain sociopathic throughout this film. This could make for an interesting character, but the ego-trip that is Gallo's relation to this film oozes out of the screen. So he's just plain unlikable. He gives none of the other characters depth at all, it all has to be Vincent Gallo on screen. You have these great actors in your film and you barely utilize them! Layla (Christina Ricci's character) has no background, she's just used as eye candy (bare in mind she was 17 during film this whereas Gallo was in his 30s). She is kidnapped and abused throughout this whole film and somehow Billy still gets the girl? Absolutely not. The neglect/mistreatment from his parents does not excuse his behavior throughout the film.I won't say that some of the stylistic choices of the film weren't visually interesting. We get scene-on-scene sequences to keep the narrative going while also showing the audience background information of our main character. The plot concept involving the Bills is decent. Also the acting (for what it is) is pretty solid. It's just so sloppily put together, non-realistic and mean spirited. It's been stated that Gallo treated everyone on set like crap and it's pretty obvious after watching this movie. I wish this film wasn't associated with Buffalo, we deserve better than Gallo and his films few shots of street signs and run down buildings.",Buffalo '66

Anyway, the film is dark, weird, sad, thought provoking and surprisingly believable.

After which Gallo ventures off alone to a strip bar owned by a retired kicker of the Buffalo Bills - to kill the kicker for losing the Superbowl in which Gallo lost money on a bet in which, to make up for the debt he had to serve five years in prison for a crime he didn't commit (remember now, the film begins with him getting out).This indie gem is downright brilliant with wonderful imagery, antique film stock, strategically placed camera-angles and split screens that all work to embody the dreamlike... or rather... nightmarish quality. Vincent Gallo is at his beautifully-ugly best as the troubled, woman-hating ex-con and Christina Ricci is basically a pretty piece of meat, but that's exactly what she's supposed to be.The climax involving Gallo facing off with the Bills kicker at the Strip Joint is one of the best filmed purposely-overly-violent scenes ever, reminiscent of early Scorsese and, a year later, ""borrowed"" by the directors of ""The Matrix"".",Buffalo '66

76,yearspew,Great Bleakness.,9,23 June 2008,"Buffalo '66 is a strange movie that I assume will divide the audience. I can understand why someone would love it as well as I can understand why someone would hate it. Vincent Gallo stars as Billy Brown, a lonesome man recently released from prison. Gallo plays a character that is so depressing, so joyless, that the acting becomes very real. I haven't watched much else of Gallo's acting, but he definitely has a presence. Whether you like or hate Billy, it can't be denied that he transmits real feelings from his persona. The mood of the film is brilliant. The bleak atmosphere is captivating and lets us get inside the dark and depressing world of Billy Brown. Every scene has this emotionally somber tone that makes you uncomfortable in a way, but letting you appreciate the art of it.Christina Ricci co-stars and does a great job of portraying the equally interesting Layla. The rest of the cast is also decent.Maybe not a film for everyone, but if you like art films and character studies, give Buffalo '66 a watch.",Buffalo '66

Here we have a quirky romantic comedy that finds a man in need of help and a woman who needs a reason not to help him. Ricci's character at once seems out of place when she first appears. One also instantly sees that Gallo's character is even more disturbed. At the end, we see a romance develop with a lot of problems, but its real. Both characters are inherently twisted, but that makes them believable. And the moral is that loves knows no boundaries and can conquer all.

79,UnknownRealmsDotNet,Indie-self pity,6,27 August 2012,"Vincent Gallo. It's amazing how notorious some people can get for practically nothing. Buffalo 66, Gallo's directorial debut isn't, however, a complete 'nothing,' for it definitely has its moments. Some of the stylistic elements are interesting, the strip-club scene in particular is very effective, and there are entertaining and memorable moments throughout. The music too is a particular highlight. But this film oozes 'indie.' In fact it reeks of it. Made with all the skill of a film school drop out, the camera-work is uneven, the story is lopsided, and the entire experience is a mixed bag. If you know anything about Gallo, this entire film is one big narcissistic self-blowjob (the bathroom scene about how 'big' he is? Come on!). But let's just forget about that. The biggest problem is Billy himself. It's hard to like him. Despite being called 'sweet/kind' so many times by his 'girlfriend,' he never does a SINGLE thing that is actually 'sweet/kind' throughout the film. He is crass, angry, and bullying to everyone he meets. So this film comes off more of a 'whoa is me. Feel sorry for me' story for a jerk. Not a good base for a story. That very story, too, is weak. The whole kidnapping premise (which is the whole story) makes little sense (there's no motivation for her to do what he wants or to continue on with him). That said, it is a nice treat to see Ricci, Huston and Roorke. And there are a lot of funny scenes here (some intentional, some not). This definitely will not appeal to a large audience, but for those who like 'cinema,' art, or the indie scene, you might get a kick out of this.",Buffalo '66

Gallo's acting and direction were well-beyond amateurish, but I'm looking forward to something a little more poignant from his next film.I particularly liked the unfolding of Billy's character. The development was well done, although I faster paced-script and dialogue would have suited the story and plot much better. The direction was great, and some of the shots were outstanding (Christina Ricci's tap dance at the bowling alley comes to mind--as does the scene of them in the picture booth that was all done in one take).

He's a modern Orson Welles and this is his Citizen Kane. And even if it's not truly a film of such magnitude, it's still the most ingenious comedy in recent memory and I'm honestly surprised the movie hasn't stirred more attention. If you find it anywhere near as funny as I did, you will laugh your as*s off more than a couple times. And it's not because of some weird, idiosyncratic brand of humor I have...no...the comedy here is real and universally brilliant...almost in a kind of Seinfeld meets Taxi Driver type of way. Yet, at the same time, the story is surprisingly and effectively moving. Gallo's performance is so alarmingly vivid and filled with such humanity the viewer can't help but be captivated by his character and grow to like and even relate to someone who initially could be called rat-like to say the least. His performance is especially amazing when you stop to consider he was the director and shot the movie with great skill and innovation, too. I think what impacted me most about the movie though, if not its amazing acting from everyone involved or the immense entertainment/comedy value, was the legitimately inspirational ending. It was powerful...in a subtle and authentic type of way and cleverly written as well. I honestly don't think it could have ended better and it's a fact that, when it comes to the movie-watching experience, nothing makes you happier than a movie that consistently and thoroughly satisfies like this did for me.

83,axellaj,"""Bleack"" Comedy in Gloomy Buffalo",7,15 August 2005,"No, I didn't misspell that. It stands for ""black"" and ""bleak"". Billy Brown (Vincent Gallo) is released from prison, but hours later has not left the bench outside the prison gate. It seems as though he has no place to go - that is, until he has to pee. He is grubby looking, in tatty clothes and pants that are too short. His look screams, ""low budget"".He meets Christina Ricci's character, Layla, in town. He is nasty to her, yet she gives him a quarter for the phone when asked. She overhears him talking to his mother. He keeps repeating who he is, and it gives the impression that he's been away for a while, or maybe Mom's feeble-minded. Layla overhears him telling her grandiose lies. His lies include a wife, whom he's goaded to produce. After he hangs up, he grabs Layla in desperation and off they go, in her car. He tells her that she will pose as his ""wife"", and is to make him ""look good"", under threats. She has chances to escape but chooses not to. While Billy was in prison, he got his friend ""Goon"", who is slow but loyal, to visit and agree to send Billy's pre-written letters to his parents on a monthly basis. These included stories of his ""successful, jet-setting life"" (it's not made clear how the locally-postmarked letters are meant to fool his parents).Billy and Layla arrive at the parents' house and Billy's father is not fooled. The parents are cold and selfish. It becomes clear that Billy's mother remembers little or nothing of his life's details. He is simply not important to her. Only football is, and at one point, she absentmindedly comments that she regretted Billy's birth because it kept her from seeing the Buffalo Bills play in the Championship that year (I assume she named her son after the team). The father is a lecherous slime-bag who looks for any excuse to play ""motorboat"" with Layla's boobs while telling her, ""Daddy loves you"".Daddy didn't make it as a singer, and when Layla asks if he has any recordings of himself, he takes her to a bedroom and sings to her over a prerecorded backing record, under a spotlight, while she sits, Baby Doll-like, on the bed. Creepy. Layla later asks to see Billy's childhood pictures, but there is only one! It's of him with his puppy. She asks what became of the pup, and we see a flashback that shows Daddy killing it in front of Billy, because it peed in the house. Daddy tells her, ""It ran away"".With dinner over, they leave. Layla chooses to remain with Billy after leaving his parents' house. They get a room. She wants him. He recoils. We discover how emotionally isolated he is. We find out that his only relationship with a girl was fantasised. I suppose that brings out that thing that some women seem to enjoy doing, where she makes him her Personal Reclaimation Project. She tries to break down his resistance to human contact and tenderness. She barely breaks through at all. They fall asleep, with him close to her. Billy intends to stay only until 2am, when Scott Woods is due to be at his strip club.Woods, a former Bills player, missed the potential game-winning kick in a game upon which Billy had bet heavily. Billy couldn't cover the bet, and the bookie let him off by having Billy take the 5 year rap for a crime committed by a friend of the bookie. Billy believes Woods took a bribe to lose, and blames Woods for ruining his life. When Billy says he has to go out, she has the feeling that he won't be back, and ends up telling him she loves him. He promises to return, but his real plan is to go to Scott Woods' strip club and kill him, then kill himself.Before entering the club, he calls Goon, makes a bequest, and apologises to Goon for being mean and nasty to him all the time. Goon suspects Billy's going to do ""something bad"".In the club, Billy comes face-to-face with Scott Woods, a fat, slobbering drunk with naked girls hanging off of him. Woods offers Billy a drink. During this exchange, Billy fantasises pulling out the gun and through some nice f/x, we see frozen shots of the homicide and the suicide, along with a scene of Billy's parents at his grave, listening to football on the radio until the father wants to leave to eat.All of that brings on an epiphany for Billy, and he decides that life is worth living. He leaves, and on the outside payphone, calls Goon back and tells him that he can't have his stuff after all, and that he met a girl who loves him. He goes back to treating Goon like crap (which shows that love hasn't turned Billy into a complete sap). He also says that he couldn't kill Woods because, ""he seemed like a nice guy"" (how he came to that conclusion, I have no idea. Offering a drink seems a gesture too feeble to resolve years of hatred). In any case, his new plan is to get back to Layla.I thought the ""epiphany"" came out of the blue. Surely Billy would've realised long before that moment, that his parents wouldn't have missed him. But I suppose he so desperately craved their approval, that he was in complete denial about their utter indifference to him. Who knows? What was really missing was any information about Layla. Who was she? And why did she behave the way she did?I felt that the wrap-up was too quick, and pat.",Buffalo '66

86,jheisel,Bizarre and yet strangely compelling,6,1 July 1999,"I've seen a lot of weird movies, and Buffalo 66 is right up there at the top. Filmed in a gritty and dark style that makes everything it touches look like it's straight out of 1976, Buffalo 76 tells the story of Billy, a man sent to prison to pay off a gambling debt to his bookie. When Billy is released from prison, he decides to visit his parents and to kill the football player who he thinks threw the game that got him into prison. Visiting his parents is not as easy as it seems, though, as Billy didn't tell them he was in prison, and concocted a series of lies through letters his retarded friend Goon sent. The largest of these lies is that he is married. Billy kidnaps Layla from her tapdancing class, and forces her to come home with him and pretend to be his wife. Billy is not satisfied with how she acts, no matter how much she talks him up. And somehow she seems to fall in love with the image of him that she created. She tells him that she loves him and that he's the sweetest guy ever, but we the viewer have watched him treat her like crap for the entire duration of the movie. Maybe he treated her nicely in the outtakes. Buffalo 66 is a strange movie that will suck you in to the life of Billy as he loses his grip on reality, only to regain it in a powerfully filmed scene near the end. If you like movies that make you feel depressed, and make you think about why you feel that way, check out Buffalo 66.",Buffalo '66

Sure you'd be scared for the first few seconds but then in 99% our survival instinct takes over and you look for a way out...and she had a bunch of em.  So her character is either a few cards short of a full deck herself or she likes greasy, visibly unstable, ugly guys.In either case, I was turned off by the rest of the movie.

89,joeydean61869,Gallo ditches conventionalism in Buffalo...let's be thankful!,7,2 November 2008,"*** out of **** stars The only sequence of Buffalo '66 that warmed my heart with thankful relief from almost two hours of wondering why the main character - Billy Brown (Vincent Gallo)- would make such unorthodox decisions against the obvious, right decisions, was during the last five minutes (approx.) of the film. What a pay off! What a tension breaking five minutes it was! I felt I could breathe easy after happily discovering that Billy is a man that can make loving, almost predictable and sane decisions after all, and all because of Layla (Christina Ricci), the new angel in his life, who he haphazardly ""kidnapped"" in a dance studio; who he finally realizes is his savior. We never find out much about Layla, if anything at all. Where does she come from and why is she the way she is? Why does she see a loving light in despicable Billy? Why doesn't she leave him, after so much verbal abuse and selfishness? I believe the reason she doesn't is because director, writer, composer and actor Gallo understands that in most scripts out of cliché Hollywood, she WOULD leave Billy. And then what kind of movie would we have? One that we've seen time and time again. The decisions that the characters make in Buffalo '66's entire time frame are the antithesis of conventionalism.What makes Billy Brown tick is strenuously simple, but only after a fair amount of contemplation after spending time with him: his parents, played by Ben Gazzara and Anjelica Huston, have systematically not given their son an ounce of validation of pride or yes, love, for his entire life, spent in frigid Buffalo, New York. Billy has spent his whole life excessively fabricating his importance in hope to gain that validation, but never with any success. Whether biological parents can demonstrate such intense apathy and coldness toward their own flesh and blood, as seen in this movie, is up for debate. But if they were able to be so callously and blindly bold, the bitter and sad result of such a man as Billy seems plausible. Gallo's skillful acting ability in his role floors me, because we actually somehow care for Billy. And why should we? Because through his sin we envision humanness that, I believe, we can all relate to: the errors we make; the lack of self-worth we may feel; loneliness; rejection; and the pain that is inflicted upon us from those who are supposed to unconditionally love us the most. Ricci's astounding performance, which I believe carries the most improvisation of any character in the film, brilliantly sheds the most light on the movie's message, which is: when someone cares about you more than themselves, it can truly change you for the better, no matter how much emotional baggage you may have. If we all had a Layla in our lives, psychiatrists would go into extinction.",Buffalo '66

Maybe I'm just a simple girl, but I was impressed. You know you've impressed me when I give your movie 1/3 of a videocassette. I was intrigued by the movie's serious comedy. Too bad Billy didn't realize how funny he was...he might have had a better time of things. Billy is desperate to impress his parents, but he is so far removed from them that I just wondered why he was even bothering. He's touchy (""Don't touch me. We're the couple that doesn't touch""). Doesn't ask for much (""Just look like you like me, that's all I want). He tries to be frugal (""I don't want to waste $2). Knows his history (""This is the blue period"") And no matter how much he tries to build himself up to killing an important businessman, he constantly throws out hints that he can probably do anything but commit a violent act, despite his experience with criminal punishment. I realize it's tempting to compare one movie with another you've seen, but that's not really appropriate in my opinion. BTW, I've seen Taxi Driver and I didn't think of it once when I saw this movie.

I can only guess that the majority of the high ratings are from friends and family of the cast and crew, because this film was so bad I didn't make it through thirty minutes before I shut it off. The direction is terrible; I felt like I was watching the film project of a film student who decided on a whim to become a filmmaker and then failed the class, deservedly. The odd overlays and cuts reek of amateur filmmaking. I didn't like anything about the film from the moment it started, aside from the odd clothing choice of Christina Ricci's character, who was in a dance class wearing what doesn't seem to me like clothing someone would be wearing in dance class, especially someone as busty as Christina. The film should've been over as soon as it started, because she had multiple chances when they first got into the car to just lock Gallo's character out and drive off. The car was already running and he got out of the car twice (I believe, maybe 3 times)before her in the parking lot. It's not like he even had a gun or gave her reason to believe he did. She simply could've locked the door, slid over and drove away. The worst he could've done was punch the car's glass. Then he gets out and goes across the street to void his bladder and she just sits and waits. I could understand if her character was mentally challenged, but what person of average intelligence wouldn't have driven off? Personally, I'd have run him down first. A ten year old child would have the sense to lock the doors and drive away, yet somehow Ricci's character didn't. There wasn't even anything likable about the characters. Gallow's character is so unlikable and unintelligent that I struggled to wait as long as I did to shut the film off. His parents have the personalities of stones. I realize that this is a black comedy, but the few areas I detected as being intended as funny simply were not. What little dialogue there is in the portion I sat through is terrible.

But this is exactly what I think makes watching Buffalo '66 so nice.Most of the time in the movie things and people are dark and dim, but like all of the other great movies where things and people are dark and dim, there is a purpose to make it dark and dim.Some say there won't be any good if there's no bad, won't be any beauty if there's no ugliness, and the same reasoning applies to won't be any light if there are no darkness and dimness. Buffalo '66 is all about light, more exactly all about Billy's new sweet life with a new sweet girl Layla, rather than the darkness and dimness almost all over the movie. Just because the last odd sweet part is so short(probably from his call to Goon to reclaim everything he gave him to the very end), doesn't mean the movie's most important part isn't it. What a weird guy Vincent Gallo is! He uses 100 minutes of the movie as preparation for the last 10 minutes. And how smart he is! Because this is probably the best way to let you feel how sweet the sweet part is!You are worried about him, you don't want him to do the stupid thing and kill himself, you'd tell him were you him you would instantly know you are going to spend the rest of your life with Layla! You as audience know how good his life could be if only he decides not to do something that he just doesn't have to do! And this is what makes the movie so weirdly romantic: all our hero needs to do to have a sweet life is decide not to do one thing that he doesn't have to do at all! And that one thing is: end your wonderful wonderful life...I was thinking when the movie ends and Vincent sings, that Billy is gonna be like: hey what was I thinking then, I've got such a nice girl I don't even deserve that wants to be my girl, and I was thinking about killing myself for absolutely no reason? F*ck myself...A lot of people tried killing themselves when their lives are actually good, many decided not to finally, and most of them, when they got their lives in front of them again, they are truly happy.

Christina Ricci had impressed me in Monster, and I'd always loved Angey Huston and Ben Gazzara, so I thought ""why not give it a look?""I did not regret it.A tale of violence without the blood and guts, a tale of mental instability without the meltdown, and a tale of sexuality without the sex, I enjoyed watching Vincent Gallo and Christina Ricci's unmistakable chemistry and amazingly wordless conversations (well, on Ms. Ricci's part anyway), particularly the scene in the photo booth which will always make me laugh.Overall it is a touching, funny love story that I will not quickly forget, and strongly urge you to see.Note: Gallo's character is an excellent bowler, and this film was released in the same year as the Coen's Big Lebowski. Coincidence?Who knows?",Buffalo '66
98,Stevieheuge,The greatest independent movie of all time,10,15 November 2002,"Buffalo '66 was written and directed by Vincent Gallo, who pulls off a magnificent performance as 'Billy Brown', who is released from prison and returns home to Buffalo to reunite with his family. He kidnaps Christina Ricci (lola) with the intention of introducing to his parents as his wife, and to support his lie that he has been working overseas for the last few years.The film is a magical comedy, but is built on the sadness of a man who has had a very troubled and odd life. Striking and original, Buffalo '66 is a prime example of how great a film can be when the director is working from his own script, giving it a very personal feel that is simply impossible to accomplish when a script is passed to another director.Christina Ricci is also magnificent as Gallo's love interest, as she slowly tries to lure Billy out of his shell, and the love story itself, though surreal, is unique and touching.This is really a stand alone film, that blows any Hollywood blockbuster right out of the water, and is a must see for any film fan.10 out of 10",Buffalo '66
99,oveets,very very good film,10,3 February 2001,"i picked this up at the vid shop without having it recommended or anything, i just read the comments on the box.  Having seen it twice now, it is one of the best films i have seen.  The acting is excellent and realistic, not overacted. I felt empathy with some of the characters, the film is quite touching at some points.  I liked the camera work and some of the music. Billy Browns lines are irritating at points but that is the character.10/10",Buffalo '66
100,arielle-2,"terrible movie, wonderful story",4,17 April 1999,Vincent Gallo is nothing short of obnoxious throughout the entire film. I love Christina Ricci but the two of them together is just a stupid choice. My boyfriend fell asleep! This could have been a good movie if someone else had done it because the STORY was excellent. I think that's the reason I dislike the MOVIE so intensely. I gave it a 4.,Buffalo '66
101,mandy-23,wonderful movie,9,22 May 1999,"I didn't expect much from this movie and was pleasantly surprised.One of the best things about it is the desolate resonance of the cold, obscure industrial city of Buffalo, NY, a bleak place with a good football team, where the meaning in people lives comes in the form of the depressing/mundane; sports, strip clubs, bowling.  Layla the unpredictable tap dancer, therefore, sticks out in a beautiful way; her manner and actions seem so fantastic, magical, that she could be simply a mirage in the life of the pathetic loser, Billy Brown. I really like the fact that you know virtually nothing about Layla.  That throughout the whole sequence, there is no realism with her.  You think, ""Ok, MAYBE she'd really fall for the guy, stranger things have happened,"" but then you become very stumped by her lack of practical, everyday concerns.  For example, you'd think that maybe she had to work the next day or something and she'd mutter a bit about that but almost from the very moment that Billy violently seizes her, the only thing she really cares about is him. Her lack of explicit characterization creates this enigma that makes the tone very ambiguous.  Maybe she is a perfectly healthy person who is able to see the beauty of this wretched man.  Or maybe she is also wretched and falls in love in a fickle way but will love someone else the next day. Have the characters found happiness that will truly transcend their bleak surroundings or simply a momentary light in a dark tunnel? This movie's way of making you guess about a character's history reminded me a bit of Mamet plays.  Also, in my opinion, Vincent Gallo's movie is far better than any by Jim Jarmusch, who employs a similar sort of minimalism with his characters.  The only real flaw I could see with Buffalo 66 is that we learn too much about BILLY.  Some history is fine but I didn't want to see him as a child in flashbacks.  I wanted him to have some of the same mystery as Layla. It's the mystery I feel when walking lonely through a dirty, soulless city, expecting to encounter only tedium and more loneliness, but hoping to run into a serious, beautiful tapdancer who will love me instantly for no good reason.",Buffalo '66
102,erasmus-4,"Simply put, Outstanding",9,27 February 2000,"I had to comment on this movie as soon as I saw it. I hesitated to see because of the description on the box - it seemed like a lame Charlie Sheen con on the run, kidnaps girl, girl falls in love movie, and that just did not appeal to me. Well, if that's what you think, you definitely have to give this movie a real chance.This is an absolute winner, the only reason I'm not rating it a full 10 is b/c so little background is given on Layla/Wendy's character - what's her motivation, what makes her tick. But maybe the point is that it doesn't matter, the movie is all about Billie. And Vincent Gallo is outstanding as the social freak Billie. I was blown away to learn that he also wrote, directed, and scored the movie, impressive to say the least.I don't want to give away finer points of the plot, but the movie has so many excellent sequences. The dialogue is hilarious. ""Can I have a kiss goodbye?"" ""Look, I said I'd get you a hot chocolate, not a kiss"" ""Can I have a hug then?"" ""Let's just shake hands."" If Election, Rushmore, or similar movies where the humor is above the heads of your average Britney Spears fan, you have to check this one out.Some great cinematography work as well, though I'm sure the use of passing cars as wipes, as well as the way flashback sequences are framed are not completely original.",Buffalo '66
103,ScreenJunkies,"Forget Ricci, lets talk about Gallo",7,5 February 1999,"It was a big year for Christina Ricci, unfortunately I didn't get to see any of her raved performances until they hit video this January. While I was relatively impressed... what got me more was a performance by a Vincent Gallo in a little film I didn't know anything about, called Buffalo '66. Gallo, wrote, starred in, directed and composed the music for this dysfunctional love story, or lack of love story rather. Gallo's performance is staggeringly good. His direction and pacing is even better. Not many directors can direct themselves this well. It only seems to work when the actor/director is also the writer. Gallo creates a world so realistic, full of pain and uncertainties, we get hooked. At first we laugh at his bickering sick family. We watch as his mother and father ignore his presence at the dinner table, the tension from their scene carries out of the VCR and into your living room. We stop laughing, and we begin to read the hurt on this man. He's got nothing. His entire life is nothing. We want him to put that gun down so badly, to start over with Layla, to try and rebuild his life. And because we get so attached to this character, it's why we love this film so much. I for one will be the first in line to see Gallo's next cinematic opus. I hope to see some of you there as well.",Buffalo '66
104,haden-2,"Promising, but ultimately crap",5,15 March 1999,"This would've been a great movie if Gallo had spent as much time developing Christina Ricci's character as he did promoting himself. It has some great editing and camera work, but is entirely implausible. The idea that anyone would find Billy anything but annoying is preposterous, and we are supposed to believe that Ricci wouldn't run away at the first chance- Please!",Buffalo '66
105,TravisD-2,Delightful,9,19 July 2000,"Swell movie. The cast is great all around, from star turns by Ricci & Gallo to cameos by Rourke & Arquette.  Gallo's movie is wonderful, alternating so easily between comedy & drama.  Beautiful and moving, Buffalo '66 is a keeper.",Buffalo '66
106,jjjjjjjjjjjjj-4,"The only film I can recall ever walking out of, so why a 7 rating?",7,20 October 2006,"I have a hard time reviewing this film, and cannot personally recommend it to others without a severe caveat, despite giving it a rather good rating.I could not stand to finish watching it. I walked out about 40 minutes in. When Cristina Ricci's character goes to the bathroom unsupervised at the Brown's house, I rooted for her to escape out the window. She didn't.I couldn't stand to be in a room with these characters one minute longer. I had a choice and I took it.BUFFALO 66 includes some breathtaking performances, especially by Angelica Huston and Ben Gazzara. The powerful & realistic portrayal of these toxic personalities is magical; albeit Black Magic. They did their jobs & animated their characters so well that they were unbearable.I can see the comparisons to Yasujiro Ozu's work; most of which I have never been particularly fond of due to the overwrought & melodramatic subject matter (despite his masterful film style).I have been told by friends who watched the film to the end & did like it that there is finally some redemption of the characters.",Buffalo '66
107,DrWorm,Well worth watching,7,31 January 1999,"Buffalo '66, while not a terribly exciting film, is quite engrossing. Vincent Gallo does a good job writing and directing, though as an actor it sometimes seems he is ad-libbing.  The basic idea has been done before, but here it happens in such a way that you really never know what's going to happen next.  Christina Ricci is excellent as always.  All this and a few quirks make this movie a better experience than the average flick.",Buffalo '66

Who has been renting it and why? It starts promisingly, but as soon as the characters begin to talk, the whole thing falls apart.  There's not a recognizable emotion or believable moment in it.  The acting is uniformly awful.  I'm not able to really explain how bad it is, but I liked Jonathan Rosenbaum's review, which can be reached by going to the external reviews link.  If you are, like me, someone who heard for years how visionary and unusual this film was, don't waste your time on it.  Yes it's unusual, but that's not always a good thing.",Buffalo '66
109,dannyll,An ex-con faces difficulties assimilating into society,4,18 June 2000,"I thought this movie rarely rose above the very ordinary.  Sure it had some redeeming features. The FOX guide described it as a ""Comedy"" - sorry, but, I must have missed the funny part. You might think that someone who has just got out of jail might wander aimlessly for a while.  Not our Billy.  He knows exactly what he needs to find.  A toilet!   Or a bathroom as Americans like to say.  So he searches early and he searches often.   Eventually he gets lucky and finds a room with a toilet and a bath. So he has a bath -- in his underpants!  Really, Billy, I've heard of a shower in a raincoat, but not a bath in your underpants, please. Billy struts the stage looking like some latter day Charles Manson and every bit the loser. I am no expert on American football, but I think the Buffalo Bills have a similar pedigree. Was it three Super Bowls in a row lost? At half time the film had a lot of potential, but like the hapless Bills themselves, the end game, the big play, just was not there. Billy should try looking on the bright side.  If his mother had been an Anaheim fan he might have been called ""Ducky"". I was waiting for something to happen, which never did, then when it finally did, it didn't. If you know what I mean. An all-star cast does not quite lift this one out of the primeval slime. Although the music, especially ""Heart of the Sunrise"" in the strip club scene, if not the gratuitous crooning of the director's father, helps.",Buffalo '66

111,dayglo-raven,Genius,10,27 July 2019,Mr. Gallo is a genius. Everything he does is art in my book. Such an original. I love his presence on screen and the snappy dialogue. It's a whip smart movie. Funny and poignant often in the same scene. The soundtrack is superb too.,Buffalo '66
112,JoeyCunninghamLennox,"Absolute Roller-coaster, please, please watch it!",10,28 August 2013,"I love this movie. When first I saw it I couldn't help myself watching it over again for the next four nights. What's great about it is the emotion it puts you through and how it has you changing you mind about the main character Billy Brown as the story progresses. I imagine there are thousands of people who have sat down to watch this picture and not been able to finish because Billy is the most complex, yet overwhelmingly irritating character ever created; constantly repeating himself and whining around in circles, but please perceive with him as I promise you it is worthwhile. It is difficult to write this review as I have to sidestep laying out any spoilers and therefor cannot say to much even though in terms of events, the movie is very lightweight. Again, if you are watching this movie waiting for something to happen, I urge you just to go with it and try to bare the uncomfortable long scene where Billy pays his parents a visit. Also, needing to be mentioned it the soundtrack of this movie which personally I believe to be among the best, featuring original music from writer, director and star Vincent Gallo as well as prog-rock artists like Yes and King Crimson. Finally, I apologise again that I am unable to say to much, I myself am frustrated and perhaps I will write a second review on this picture which does contain spoilers for there really is a lot to say about it. To do so in a closing statement without being specific about the story line, I'd like to say that Buffalo 66 is the single movie which puts me through the widest array of emotions and I desperately want others to have the same experience I did.",Buffalo '66
113,susancvan,Not Entirely Awful,4,8 September 2019,"Ok. It was an interesting story. It was well acted. It was definitely low budget. I was born in Montreal, so the atmosphere of the snowy Buffalo Streets was similar, therefore familiar to me.
The opening scene where he needs to p** is hilarious. Then when he opens his mouth and starts verbally abusing a young girl who is trying to be nice to him, I lose sympathy for him. Then when he proceeds to kidnap her, letting her drive her car, he gets out of the car a couple of times and I am wondering why she just doesn't drive away? He's seriously scary at this point, now not just verbally abusive, but physically as well.
But... I'm still watching. My sympathy for him returns when we meet his parents. The Father killed his dog when it was just a puppy in front of him. His Mother cares more about football than her own son and they only own one photo of him and have trouble locating it. Mom has a whole album of the football team though. She offers him chocolate donuts forgetting her own son is highly allergic to chocolate and when he reminds her she argues with him. The kidapped girl also feels sympathy for him because she goes along with his request to pretend to be his wife.
My sympathy for him leaves again when we learn he wants to kill the kicker who lost a game he had placed a $10, 000.00 bet on. Who bets that much on anything? It looks like the family is middle class at best. If you have $10, 000.00 kicking around these days and you're not filthy rich there are better things you could do with it. Oh, but wait it's worse than that because he doesn't actually have the $, so the bookie makes him a deal that he take the fall for someone else and confess to something he actually hasn't done and spend 5 years in prison.
The one redeeming quality in the movie is the unconditional love the girl apparently feels for this man. She sees a good person inside this mess of a human being and sticks with him like a guardian angel. The endging was kind of sweet. I do like stories that end well, but the movie on the whole was just too quirky, strange and pathetic.
I had to give it some stars though because the acting is good. Angelica Huston and Ben Gazzara are wonderful as the horrible parents. Christina Ricci truly seems sweet, if naive. Gallo played the part of a loser like he was born to it and the brief bits with Rourke as the bookie, Arquette as the nasty ex school mate (reminded me of kids I went to school with.) and his goofball loser of a friend were also well played. We knew nothing of the movie and tuned in only for the cast , although we were unfamiliar with Gallo we knew and liked everyone else and were left wondering who they all owed the favour to?
I was waffling between 4 and 5 stars. I'd like to give it 4 and 1/2 but I don't see half stars here so if my choice is 4 or 5 I have to go down to a 4. We almost turned it off....",Buffalo '66

In fact, it was one of the most infuriating things I've ever seen.  Pretentious, self-indulgent, self-absorbed, and just plain unbelievable, this film inspired my brother to promise to beat the crap out of Vincent Gallo should they ever meet.

Later i also learned that he had been in company with likes of Jean Michael Basquiat.Verisimilitude of performances and sequence of events can actually make you feel all of it happening with you. Human being in despair develops dangerous ideas in their mind as a means to show their hatred towards things that disappointed them. And sometimes he is so obsessed with the idea, he becomes oblivion of all the facts.Billy brown was force to get himself convicted as a favor to pay his debt. When he is released from Jail he is filled with rage and his only motive is to kill Scott woods who he believes deliberately lost the game for 'Buffalo'. Billy batted for Buffalo and their loss got him into debt. But before that he once wishes to visit his parents who are least excited to see him after long. His mother is only happy to see his son alive and not eager to know anything except his good looking wife. Billy, to present himself reasonably for couple of hours in front of his parents abducts a young dancer who falls for him at first sight. Though the proposal of pretending herself as his wife and visiting Billy's parents seems an absurd idea she agrees to do so without any resistance. Billy's obsession to kill Scott Woods fails him to realize the true love of that girl until towards the very end of the movie.Billy's disturbed and confused state of mind is well portrayed by Gallo and it will drive you to hysterical laughters. Ricci is so adorable, no one but only Billy can neglect her charm.",Buffalo '66

The film stock it was shot on gives it a washed out graininess that really suits the story and the environment it is set in. The characters are brilliant. Yes, Billy Brown is an obnoxious bastard, but as the film unfolds it becomes clear this is just a front hiding his true child-like self. Christina Ricci is great, especially as this is in the pre boob-reduction period. And its good to see old classics getting cameos, such as Jan-Michael Vincent and Mickey Rourke (who couldn't get much work at the time).

This movie has so much that I look for in an independent film.  It has inventive story-telling, developed characters, great performances, and so much emotion.  And it even has Ben Gazarra.  I especially liked the scenes where Ben was singing and sounding like he'd like to sound, not as he really is and Christina Ricci is dancing and fantasizing in the bowling alley. I have a lot of respect for someone like Vincent because he is putting his heart and soul on the screen for you and me to see.

Count me among its admirers.  I have to say that I agree that Layla's nonchalant reaction to being kidnapped by Billy is not realistic, but hey, it's a movie!  It works as far as the movie is concerned.  This film is about a man who, for his entire life, has never been loved by anyone, particularly his parents.  Because of this he has built up a wall around himself, a wall of hatred and anger.  Then someone comes along who loves him unconditionally, threatening to penetrate that wall that he has grown so comfortable with.

However, I had a strong feeling that it wouldn't be showing in my local cinema, so I had to wait.Months later I had forgotten about this apparent gem of an indie movie, until I came across it while browsing through the video collection of my local Tower records. As soon as it caught my eye, I picked it up and purchased it with little hesitation. I was intrigued to find out why it was so highly acclaimed by the author of the recommended section in the magazine.I put it on late at night and started to watch it with interest. However, I got half way through the film and fell asleep. To my dismay I woke to see the end credits rolling. I turned the light off and went back to sleep realizing that I had missed the end of a very promising film.As early as I could the next day, I rewinded the film to the place when my eyelids grew heavy and watched the remaining part- my conclusion? I loved it.Vincent Gallo shines as his own creation. From the outset, he makes you laugh but also feel sorry for him. His quirky dress sense makes him original, and the dialogue leaves you wondering whether you should be laughing or not. He seems to have a bad attitude, not wanting to let anyone close to him, but when you see his parents you can start to realize why he acts this way. His mother is an obsessed Buffalo's football fan, who seems to care about her team far more then Billy, (Gallo) and his father seems to only care about himself.Christina Ricci plays an interesting part and goes along for the ride. The film does not delve into the background of her character, e.g: where she lives, works, or whether she has family etc, but, although this would be interesting it is not essential to the plot. The story focuses more on Gallo's character Billy. By the end of the film I felt that I'd grown with him.The film does make you laugh, there is no doubt about that. It is obvious that Vincent Gallo's intention was to touch peoples funny bones, but, you can also see that he is trying to do more than that. It is a well rounded film that has elements of comedy and drama, which often seem entwined.This is Vincent Gallo's Masterpiece, he wrote, directed, cast, and did the score for the movie. 'Come on Mr. Gallo where is your next masterpiece? Surely a studio has called you again on the strength of this work?'While watching the film with friends I did fear that it wouldn't be their cup of tea (for some unknown reason) but all, in turn, agreed that it was a great film that they wanted to watch again.I highly recommend this film, so get hold of it if you can and try not to fall asleep half way through- you will regret it.",Buffalo '66
131,philushr,Quite simply one of the best written screenplays ever...,8,27 May 2003,"Dialogue in this film is second to none. Billy Brown (Vincent Gallo) as a character is extremly interesting. Showing a range of emotions in different social situations from a bully towards Layla and Goon to showing his true insecurities to his parents and Wendy Balsam - it paints an awesome picture and you really get to feel for the character. There are  suggestions that he was physically or sexually attacked in prison. His reaction to the guy in the toilet and the fact he doesn't like being touched - this explains the way he acts towards Layla.The bowling alley is one of my favourite scenes - Billy entering like a returning war hero and we see a side of him we haven't seen before. The fact he can bowl fills him with confidence, it seems that bowling is one of the only things Billy is happy doing. He's acting cool, suggesting that he picked Layla up hitch-hiking as if it happens everyday and he has a lot of dispensible women which of course we know is not the case. Also the guy at the bowling alley is the only person that Billy is actually pleasant to for the best part of the film. The guy seems to be a little slow and believes Billy is someone that he really isn't, of course Billy thrives on this and in return offers kind gestures back. My favourite bits would have to be 'is this a shifter car?', 'that's why they call you goon', 'i'm outside the club now, yeh it's crazy', 'the king is here', the way Billy's Dad says 'Bingo'... Along with Rupert Pupkin from The King of Comedy, Billy Brown is my favourite film character. Excellent.",Buffalo '66
132,Blad33,True indie masterpiece from one of the futures best filmmakers...,10,11 September 2006,"Buffalo '66 begins with this fascinating montage, the outside of a gritty prison facility in the snow. A striking quality of footage, where the filmmaker, (genius) Vincent Gallo, used specially modified 8mm tape (which he apparently begged Kodak to make) in a 32mm camera. He's also one of the two stars of the show, a phenomenal, weird actor. He looks like a sort of attractive cockroach in human form, with heavyset, darkly incandescent gleaming eyes. He plays Billy Brown. ""My name is Billy Brown"" as he later tells his co-star.Without any dialogue from the beginning this film manages to be hilarious and is something not melodramatic but a situation we can all relate to. He has to urinate. They can't let him back in to the prison. He can't go in the snow or it'll freeze and after he's left the area the only open restaurant isn't allowing him in. He stoops at the waist, grasping his crouch at times to hold it in, finds a spot then...someone approaches. Finally he goes into a dance hall when the homosexual guy looks at him and ""pees"" him off. Though he doesn't manage to pee. We see the first line of brilliant acting, where Gallo encumbers in dialogue and action what frustration actually is by practically assaulting the homosexual man (squeezes his, er, cheeks together) just after the man makes a mistake by commenting ""but it's so big...""Out next star, easily one of the best contemporary actresses ever, Christina Ricci (who plays Layla), enters and is literally kidnapped by Vincent's character. This happens realistically, with a dark sense of humour. The film is already receiving full marks from me, it's already better than 90% of what's out there in Hollywood-land today (and the rest of the world.) As well as dysfunctional Billy Brown we meet his insane parents (just after he gets to pee on a tree), his semi- retarded supposed best friend, and we see how gangster/betting shop owner played by Mickey Rourke was responsible for putting Billy Brown in prison Billy is a bit of a philistine it seems: He doesn't seem to listen to music, watch films, read etc. He just knows football and goes bowling. Nothing else seems to exist in this reality. But now he has Layla, not just the parents who don't seem to care much about him and who live in their own, grave and depressing little world.If only he hadn't bet on Buffalo to win, the American football player wouldn't have missed the kick. But Billy knows for a ""fact"" that he missed it on purpose. The build up and the mistreatment of Layla,( who is put in the spotlight for a moment, where she gets to demonstrate her tap-dancing skills, possible her true dream), leads to a single action sequence with a thunderous rock-music build up. This is where Billy meets the guy that he believes inadvertently put him in jail, the Buffalo player who supposedly purposely missed the kick to lose his team the game.The action sequence is highly inventive, using synthetic models for heads, the loud fast music, and slow motion to create a brilliant, adrenaline pumping effect.Billy is saved, however, in the end by his new love who he at first pushes away. It's the one good thing in his life, somebody that's willing to stand up for him, stay with him:Layla. It's a beautiful portrayal of a disturbed man in a backward town with the perfect, but still real, women who saves him in the end. This is truly romantic. Not like those sixties and prior fake melodramatically romanticised films, which the film world had to get out of it's system before moving on to such true masterpieces like Buffalo 66.",Buffalo '66
133,sHERIFFOFSHERIFFSTOWN,One of those few films worth watching over and over again.,10,27 December 2005,"I wasn't too sure about this film at first. I had heard the brown bunny sucked, so I was unsure of Vincent Gallo's talents. Turns out, it was one of the many times I have realized I am an idiot. This is one of the best films I have ever seen. It may have been the best film I have ever seen, had I not seen way too many movies to pick out a favorite. This film is about Billy Brown, an ex-con who was sent to jail on account of the buffalo bills football team. Turns out, he isn't real good at gambling. Anyway, he gets out of jail- but immediately feels the need to go to the bathroom. Desperately searching places to go, he comes across a dance studio of some sort. Long story short, he calls his parents- kidnaps a girl to pose as his wife- and leaves to have dinner. The girl falls in love with him, unaware of his plans to kill the person responsible for his time in prison. Very emotional film, and very well acted/directed/written by Vincent Gallo. I would give this movie 10/10 stars. It was also very inspiring- makes, me at least, feel the need to stop wasting my life and write something. Goddammit.",Buffalo '66
134,hannahhallgrimsen,Disappointed,3,3 February 2021,"I had really high hopes for this movie. And the aesthetic and camera work was on point - just my thing. Got some beautiful scenes in there.
The plot was a good idea - but sadly the execution let me down, and the weak/unlikeable characters.The only fully likeable character is Leilah, who sadly ends up only standing as a manic pixie dream girl and not a real character with a story or any other purpose than mending Billys broken soul.Billy however does have some insane character development, but overall he is not a good person and mostly he just annoyed me for large parts of the movie.
Not to mention the film being extremely slow and bleak, with very little good humor or scenes to break the silence. It lacks balance and strong characters.
I wanted to like this so bad, i just didnt.",Buffalo '66
135,fac21,Awesome!,10,26 January 1999,"This movie totally rocks. It's a fun story where the actors absorb you the whole time. I love the look of the film quality, the production design and the camera movements. Vincent Gallo, despite his big off-screen ego, has made a great debut.",Buffalo '66
136,xmute,"Not brilliant, but great nonetheless.",9,2 January 1999,"Once you get past the first 20 minutes of this film (which, granted, are not not not good), you'll see a great film that just fell short of brilliance. Granted, some of Gallo's techniques are a bit cliche'd and over-the-top artsy. However, he makes up for it in story and the latter of the film.Definitely worth seeing. Definitely worth remembering.",Buffalo '66
137,BobbyDee-2,Excellent !,9,4 July 1999,"A thought provoking movie involving interesting characters with great texture. Gallo is excellent as the anxious just released from prison ""Billy Brown"", who we learn has some unresolved issues relating to his incarceration and towards his parents. Ricci also deserves much credit for her understated performance as the understanding observer in what for many actors might have otherwise been a difficult role to play so convincingly. The direction is original and effective, and the screenplay well written (both by Gallo). 9/10",Buffalo '66
138,happydealsuk,One of the weirdest and best movies you can find,8,27 October 2020,"One of the hallmarks of this film is that it is so unconventionally, unforgivingly, uncompromisingly strange, which certainly isn't only a result of the writing, but of the lead actor Vincent Gallo. I think he mostly plays himself- not a bad thing, as it really works in this film.
The characters are so refreshingly dysfunctional, it's a trip! Try it, you might like it...and...oh., try to watch with your significant couple, just 'spanning' time!",Buffalo '66
139,iwatheblind-369-566957,"Incredibly touching story, beautifully acted",10,13 May 2012,"This is one of my favourite films - and not just because it's a wonderful visual experience with great performances by all actors. It's because love in this film feels true, far from the ordinary attraction we've grown accustomed to watch portrayed as love, especially on the screen.I'm reminded of a moving speech in the ""Poupées russes"" film from one of the female characters, about being in love with a man's imperfections. But here it's more than this: it's a pure, child-like image of love, an ideal they both seem to share. Love is seeing the best in someone and that's exactly what Layla does. In this sense it doesn't matter if Billy is so pathetic that normally no one would pay attention to him. We can watch everything through Layla's eyes and understand her reactions because we too can't help but care.As for the kidnapping, it's obvious the man is a harmless lunatic, not a dangerous criminal. We see plainly on Layla's face (superb mimic by Christina Ricci) that she reads him perfectly and is curious to find out more, dismissing the completely ridiculous threats for what they are: empty words. A bit far-fetched? Perhaps, but not entirely implausible.",Buffalo '66

141,ACEandaRAG,Don't settle for average,8,25 February 2006,"Buffalo '66 is indisputably a genuine display of fraught uncertainty and possibility. The film presents the raw energy of frustrated antagonist Billy Brown (Vincent Gallo) as he feebly attempts to mend his troubled past. With the new freedom of his release from a wrongful imprisonment, Billy's plan is simple: Visit his parents (who are ignorant of his prison life, instead blindly believing Billy joined the CIA) and kill the Buffalo Bills kicker whose missed field goal is responsible for his ruined life. In order to pursue his agenda as a free man, he decides a trophy wife to represent his wonderful CIA accomplishments is needed. In order to impress his parents, he kidnaps Layla (Christina Ricci) and teaches her to portray his soul mate in front of his family. An unexpected romance develops between the inexperienced and tormented dreamer Billy and the nonchalant captive Layla. The strange desperate chemistry between Billy and Layla coupled with the exaggerated actions of his nostalgic father (retired lounge singer) and his obsessive mother (extreme Buffalo Bills fan) creates the trip that has become Billy's life.Buffalo '66 is among the most original movies I have ever experienced. The film sets a new standard for expression and diversity in film-making today. I enjoyed the film for the innovative nature of this thoughtful and comedic feature, and found it very refreshing. A dysfunctional romance, prison, and the Buffalo Bills; Buffalo '66 is a triumph.",Buffalo '66
142,BabyM,Huh?,7,29 May 2000,"'Independent' film means so much to me after watching this film the other day. 'Different' is also re-defined.I was rather confused throughout the film and I had trouble understanding exactly what it was about and why it came to the conclusion it did, but I do congratulate the acting skills of Anjelica Houston, (of whom I couldn't see anything past her acting in the Addams family). It was well directed, but Gallo's voice and speech got on my nerves.... and THOSE RED SHOES!!!!I'd give it 7, and a couple question marks!",Buffalo '66
143,puppydre,I cannot understand why this movie is so popular.,2,20 February 1999,"Everyone seems to love this movie and I don't get it. The premise is completely unbelievable. Now, I've known some co-dependent women in my life who might actually, on a bad day, behave like Christina Ricci's character does, but the problem is, we see no details from her life, examples of her decisions, interior motivations or anything else that might explain why she agrees to help out, then fall in love with this horror show of a violent, highly troubled brute. In fact, in typical Hollywood man-centric story-telling, the movie tells us nothing about her character at all!I suppose everybody like this movie because of the wierd camera angles and the fact that they somehow managed to get the rock group ""Yes"" to part with the rights to one of their songs. OK, I can give them some points for that. Ultimately, however, the story does not ring true, does not surprise or engage, and does not manage to wrap itself up without the obligatory scene in a strip bar.",Buffalo '66
144,analyst-2,"at time interesting, at times merely annoying",5,10 May 1999,"I wanted to see this film for a long time, but was ultimately disappointed. The plot was thoroughly original - the idea of Scott Norwood's botched field goal in the Superbowl having such an effect on someone's life was brilliant. The cast was also quite good. My biggest complaint was the dialogue - it was rarely interesting and often way too repetitive. The scene in the photo booth merely covered the same territory over and over for what seemed like an eternity. The same problem existed when he was going on about how he didn't drive 'shifter cars'. A good job of editing could have turned this into a tight, strong film. The final scene in the strip joint was pretty cool, though. One final observation - it was amazing how many quarters Billy always seemed to have on hand for the dozens of calls he made from public phone booths!",Buffalo '66
145,cgaros,A great movie,10,27 July 1999,"i liked almost everything about this movie.  people have complained about christina ricci's character being not very fleshed-out, but i think that was probably the intention of the film-maker...there is no way she would ever logically like a guy like Billy or act in the way she does, so no attempt is made to explain her character.  at first i expected her to try to run away or yell at Billy or something, but that movie has already been made a few times, and it was better this way. buffalo '66 reminded me a lot of taxi driver in its overall structure....crazed loner at the center, idealized woman seen occasionally, and more real girl present more often, along with the loner's obsession with killing a specific famous person.  i think the reason for the dual ending was that vincent gallo wanted to do a taxi driver like movie, with death and violence at the end, but he also wanted to make another movie, where the ending is more peaceful.  although it's only a few minutes of footage, the substitution of one ending for another changes the whole movie...with the violent ending, the movie's message is one of despair, and the point is that people like Billy can not overcome their demons, even with love.  with the alternate ending, the movie becomes more of a romantic happy kind of movie.",Buffalo '66

At moments, the story of Billy Brown's life is so terribly tragic and bizarre, you almost have to break the tension by cracking a laugh. In the film, Vincent Gallo's ex-jail bird character, Billy Brown, kidnaps a young tap-dancer named Layla, played by Christina Ricci, to pose as his wife on his visit back home to his dysfunctional family.  The colors are beautifully bold and somehow elegant by being so far past tacky.  The film is really great.The story is actually based somewhat on Vincent Gallo's own traumatic life. The Sinatra song that the Billy Brown's father sings to Layla in the bedroom is actually a tape of Vincent Gallo's father, Vincent Gallo, Sr.  I read in an interview that Vincent Gallo has scripted another movie he hopes to direct and feature in.

But it was the atrocious acting that held me past the point of the dance studio.  Most of the intriguing people I meet on a daily basis are bad actors at life.

It was only after I purchased it on DVD that I saw in the credits just how much Gallo had to do with this film. He did just about everything major to complete this movie...from the music to the writing credits. Personally, I think that he did a fabulous job and I compliment him highly on this piece of motion picture art.I tend to take this story on a personal level. I have never been to prison, but I know that I can relate to a lot of what Gallo's character feels about his family. My family life was not too great whilst growing up, but it really put things in perspective for me to see someone who's parents are that oblivious to their son's most basic needs.Some of the scenes may seem absurd and extreme as far as the obliviousness of the parents, but in a sense I think that is what Gallo was trying to get across to the viewing audience. This factor makes it all the more pertinent as to why Gallo's character is the way he is. To me this film is a reflection of an individual's life who has nothing to lose and yet so much to gain. Everything from the cold and gloomy atmosphere during the first half of the film to Gallo's character's pessimistic demeanor and repetitiveness of phrases only emphasize the aura of his life-long frustration and contempt for the world while revealing his desperate and longing need to find something tangible for once in his life...something that he apparently never had and that he thankfully finds in the confidence of Ricci's character.I could go on and on and on about how much this film meant to me and how beautifully directed, written and acted out this piece of work is, especially in the end since I have had thoughts and have considered and contemplated such things in the past. I admit that the height of the film's end freaked me out for a few moments, but left me feeling overwhelmed with relief and joy during the final concluding moments.To sum up: You HAVE TO watch this film.

170,pale69rider,Loser cool with a heart. . .,10,21 July 2004,"Actor/Director/Writer Vincent Gallo's Buffalo 66 is, on a superficial level, almost irritatingly 'indie' (i.e. that which seethes with artistic reaching and uses gritty film stock to prove it). Characters wear clothes best suited to an old Blind Melon video, dialogue is pungent and ironically repetitive, and gloomy weather endlessly hangs over everything, in what at first glance appears to be yet another entry into the 'loser chic' school of cinema.But wait. . .Instead of wearing its disaffected stance as a badge of credibility, Buffalo 66 uses it as a springboard to a far deeper, and very affecting, exploration of the psyche of human failure. Using Buffalo (and its poor, woeful Bills) as a backdrop and rather hilarious metaphor for missed opportunities and blown chances, Gallo picks at the protective, pseudo-celebratory scab that was Beck's 'Loser', and exposes the real pain of the loser.Gallo is terrific as Billy, just released from a five-year prison stint after a 10,000 bet with a loanshark (played by that perennial loser Mickey Rourke, in fine scuzzy form) and a missed fieldgoal kick force him to take the fall for a crime to pay back his debt. Jimmy's first move is to kidnap a cherub named Layla (Christina Ricci, in an inspired performance), only to convince his parents, who've never known he was in jail, that he's married.Angelica Huston and Ben Gazzara play Billy's unbalanced parents in a reunion scene which is at once uproariously funny and horrifyingly telling (they have exactly one childhood picture of Billy). Slowly, Buffalo 66 reveals itself to be a tragi-comic parade through an agonizing childhood and adolescence, one that still vividly and actively haunts Billy's present.As a director, Gallo brilliantly employs his quirky visual playfulness to compliment the plot's unfolding, while never overstating his ideas (Oliver Stone, take heed). There is much that is funny, tragic, and startlingly beautiful in Buffalo 66, and it ranks as one of 1998's finest films.",Buffalo '66

Simply one of the best films in my time (born 1970), this tale uses subtle, but pervasive imagery to portray the feelings of an extremely self-conscious, somewhat paranoid, and certainly depressed fellow as he (eventually) reconciles his bleeek childhood with the even bleeeeker world of today.This is really a love story, all the other plots that are woven into this story ultimately end with Billy finding redemption through love.

That this is a common theme among detractors leads me to believe that Gallo is operating on a level that certain people can only find absurd.I'm not sure whether I think people who don't enjoy ""Buffalo '66"" are stupid, or just emotionally cold, or perhaps, most likely, lacking taste. This is definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen, and I really feel a little bit sad that not everyone can enjoy it. It just seems painfully obvious to me that, literally, not one second of the film is wasted. The events of the ""plot"" are totally irrelevant.

The acting, directing, storyline, script, cinementography etc. etc. etc. Vincent Gallo and Christina Ricci are great together and the role of the Bills-obsessed mother played by Angelica Huston was praiseworthy.  Being from Rochester, NY (an hour away from Buffalo) made the movie that much better.  It started out for me as being really sad. I wanted to cry for Billy's character.  Towards the end I was getting annoyed with his attitude but the ending changed it all for me.  It was perfect.

180,hugodanner2002,A Personal and Poignant fable...,10,14 February 2005,"'Buffalo '66' is one of those unusual kind of American movies that could only have been made as the debut feature of an independent filmmaker. The film is oddly proportioned, brimming with the flamboyant ideas of its director, autobiographical and relentlessly self-indulgent; and for exactly these reasons the film has its own kind of unique charm. Vincent Gallo's directorial debut, which he also co-scripted and wrote the soundtrack for, is a quirky, deadpan tragicomedy that departs from traditional modes of filmic communication and indulges his idiosyncrasies. Gallo clearly emphasises performance and characterisation over plot and narrative; a trait that is reminiscent of the film's of actor/director John Cassavetes. The film focuses on the character of Billy Brown and provides an in-depth character study of an emotionally isolated and paradoxical individual, who is struggling to come to terms with events that took place in his childhood. On the one hand, Billy desperately wants to love and be loved but at the same time he is uncomfortable with physical contact and intimacy. Seated on the steps outside his parents house, feeling sick at the thought of seeing them again, he asks Layla, ""Would you hold me?"". However, when she moves closer, Billy shrieks, ""Don't touch me!"". During the course of the film, the tough criminal exterior that Billy presents when kidnapping Layla is stripped away to reveal a sensitive innocent who desperately craves the attention he's been deprived of all his life. Only after Billy has overcome his feelings of frustration and resentment towards an uncaring world can he accept the love that is eventually offered to him by Layla. Gallo puts an incredible amount of nervous energy into his performance as Billy Brown and that makes it difficult to take your eyes off him. He delivers Billy's repetitive, quick-fire dialogue with tremendous vigour and a keen sense of comic timing. Gallo re-invigorates the language of contemporary cinema, employing a number of striking cinematic devices that give the film freshness and vitality. The entire film is ingeniously shot on 35mm reversal film stock, a process that produces distinctive contrast and colour saturation. This technique perfectly encapsulates the cold, grey industrial landscapes of Buffalo, bleeding them of their colour and giving the spectator a visceral sense of the raw weather and alienating locations that function in the narrative as a metaphor for Billy's own feelings of loneliness and estrangement. Gallo's cinematography is precise and idiomatic. Certain shots appear meticulously composed like still photographs whilst others, like the shot of Billy's indolent friend's potbelly, have the ability to sum up an entire character in just one single image. The flashbacks to Billy's troubled childhood are cleverly communicated through a series of optically inset frame-within-frames that start off as tiny boxes and gradually grow to fill the entire screen. However, Gallo's greatest and most inventive visual achievement is saved until the final staging of Billy's climatic shooting in the strip club. He presents it as a startling succession of mind's eye tableaux vivants, freeze frames that capture the graphic anatomical detail of the shooting in a darkly comical way. The entire sequence is accompanied with strange perfection by the extravagant 70s prog-rock sounds of 'Yes'.The film is filled with a number of hilariously peculiar comic episodes. Take for example, the scene in which we first realise Billy is an incompetent criminal when he is unable to drive Layla's getaway vehicle because it's a 'shifter' car. Noticing that Layla is clearly amused by this, Billy goes into a childish verbal tirade in a pathetic attempt to try and disguise his shortcomings: ""I'm used to luxury carsI drive cars that shift themselves"". Another humorous highlight takes place during an exchange between Billy and Layla in a $2 automated photo booth as they pose for photographs to send to Billy's parents. The comedy in this scene arises from Billy's insistence that the photos of them as a loving couple appear authentic and simulate them 'spanning time' together, whilst at the same time not allowing Layla to actually touch him: ""We're the couple that doesn't touch one another. We like each other. We like each other a lot and we span time together. We just don't touch each other, all right?"".'Buffalo '66' is a refreshingly honest and personal film that is directed with a confident and singular vision. Vincent Gallo's poignant fable shows rare creative flair whilst providing a perceptive insight into the pathos of failure and the indispensable nature of love.Richard Pickering",Buffalo '66
181,alma_ehrencrona,pureness all through,9,14 December 2004,"Actually there is no technical profession in this movie, but still a lot of work must lie behind it. After seeing it I was totally out of my mind and emotionally exploding, even though the quality is pretty bad the movie contains just the most breathtaking scenes. This movie isn't like Hollywood, this movie conveys life. This movie conveys the real and pure human behaviour without any cover up's and I love it! The paleness and the dreary feeling that is in this production makes it just more exciting in a funny kind of way. Without any flashy lights and exaggerated effects everything gets more close, you can really feel the tension all through the story and it's a tripp I have never experienced before.

And the cast!: Ben Gazzara as the cruel unfeeling father who pretends to like Gallo's fiancée just so he can nuzzle her boobs, Mickey Rourke, Anjelica Huston, and, practically dug up from the grave, as Gallo did with Cheryl Tiegs in Brown Bunny, a dissipated Jan-Michael Vincent. Kudos also go to Kevin Corrigan, a relatively unknown actor whose performance is somewhat remarkable.

183,hedelma1,Edgy and Fresh,8,6 November 2005,"When you first begin viewing Buffalo 66, you may be struck by the starkness of the set and characters. You may even wonder why you are watching it in the first place, yet you are drawn into the mix. The story is a strange one: a man gets out of prison, and hijacks a young woman, who becomes a willing victim in his plan to demonstrate to his family that he never went to prison at all, but rather, had a wonderful life and a girlfriend. We begin to feel that she has nothing special to do that day, and doesn't mind. What is truly intriguing is the premise, as it unfolds, to reveal why our hero had gone to prison in the first place and how his true character evolves to become what it was destined to be. Anyone who is a fan of Confederacy of Dunces and the justification that someone's love gives to our existence will be a fan of Vincent Gallo and this movie, as well as the many other projects with which this interesting man is engaged.",Buffalo '66

Everyone should see this film. This is what film is about. It is a self contained masterpiece of expression / communication. This needs nothing fancy said about it other than it is a great story. Great stories i think come from great characters and the character depicted in this film are full and alive in a way that you rarely see in film.I think the most important and greatest achievement of this film is in its writing. There is no line in this film that doesn't feel like the character just came out with it. The amount of play in vincent gallo's dialogue is a joy to see. The people in this film are as real people are.I love this film.

And as a general rule if the same name has four or more credits I do not bother watching assuming it too self-indulgent. However, I watched ""Buffalo '66"" not knowing the credits and was surprised at the end that this film was driven by one person, Vincent Gallo. The film captured the real America that many discover on a road trip - the America of Dennys, cheap hotels, giant takeaway coffee cups and broken families. The central character of Billy (Vincent Gallo) is not a traditional romantic lead, but he is closer to what most American men are than what Tom Cruise is. The film has that rare honesty, similar to that of ""Waiting for Godot"", so that the viewer leaves understanding what the film is about.",Buffalo '66
189,John Zep,This movie had almost no redeeming qualities,2,3 September 1999,"This movie was terrible. Technically, Gallo shows that he is utterly inept at making a film.  Emotionally, the movie was empty.The camera work in this movie was lame (I've seen home movies that looked better).  The special effects were cheesy and poorly executed.The dialogue was also horrendous, and clearly derivative of such talented writers as Tarintino...heres an example: Gallo: ""Mom, I told you I can't drink soda"" Mom:   ""Its not soda, its ginger ale"" Gallo  ""Ginger ale is soda mom..it has bubbles..its the same thing""Reminds me of the famous ""Quarter Pounder in France"" scene from pulp fiction...but with out the wit or timing.Oh and all the characters are unbelievable too...Also, the music was terrible..it distracted me during the film.  When the credits rolled and showed that Gallo wrote all the music, well, that explained it...terrible film-making. And you can't blame the low budget.  Because lots of people have made better movies with less money! (i.e. El Mariachi, Clerks, Blair witch, etc)

The performances of Ben Gazzara & Angelica Huston were brilliantly understated, and Christina Ricci will probably never have the opportunity to put in a more fascinating performance. I felt you couldn't help but like her, and I enjoyed the way they left her prior life a mystery. Her reactions to Billy Brown's bizarre behavior are priceless and so authentic. Kevin Corrigan is brilliant as ""Goon"" a/k/a ""Rocky"".

Billy's parents did not know he went to jail so he told his parents he was leaving town to go work for the goverment and that he would not be back for some time.Billy is planing to kill the kicker of the buffalo bills for missing a feild goal kick, because thats why he is in jail for taking the rap for a guys gambling loss.

The film was panned, and it was subject to widespread controversy, but its reassuring to know he made this little-known cult movie.It is not really an enjoyable experience, but an honest and depressing one featuring realistic performances Gallo (lead star) and Christina Ricci, in a tap-dancing scene you Ricci fans won't want to miss.It elevates itself from the typical romantic drama, and thus makes it a better one. An independent masterpiece.",Buffalo '66
195,S-F-Hutton,Brilliant Gallo!,10,3 November 2004,"I have seen this film numerous times and it gets better after each viewing. I just love the work of Gallo and hope that he keeps on making films. I have not been fortunate enough to see Brown Bunny yet as it has not opened in the UK although I hope it does soon. I think Gallo is unique in his style of film making. I have always wanted to work in the film industry but after having seen this film I was dead set on being a director, which can be put down to Gallos' influence. This film definitely deserves the title of the best independent film of the decade. This is my favourite film of all time and I feel as though it deserves more credit, along side other epics like Ben Hur and Titanic etc.",Buffalo '66
196,huckones,Unwatchable,1,3 March 2005,"Gallo, whoever HE thinks he is, is lost in this film. He wrote, directed and acted in the film and has no one to blame for it's failure. I say failure having only made it through the first 25 minutes before I bailed out. The film has a feel to it until the tenth minute of character Billy's search for a place to urinate. A possible upturn when he meets up with Layla (Ricci) in the dance studio. Then off the edge, straight to the bottom; Billy to Layla, sitting on the front stoop of Billy's parent's house, ""Hold me, don't touch me""... Click, I'm off IFC and over to TCM.

197,Tafiet,Not extraordinary but good,7,14 December 2015,"The story of Buffalo 66 is one of a man who is released from prison and the plot of the movie stems from the fact that he lied to his parents about this and created a fiction of his life where he has a wife and is a successful business man. The thing I appreciated the most about this movie was the effort behind it. This is a movie where you can tell that thought actually went into it, as well as passion. There is an endeavor to create something original and artful and for that I commend the writer/director/main actor, Vincent Gallo. Christina Ricci also gives a swell performance, even though she does not have a great deal of dialogue. Our main character is an angry loner, which is something that I took immense pleasure in watching because I could relate to him wholly. I enjoyed that when I watched this movie I never felt as if I was wasting my time, which is the worst feeling for me when I watch something that's not good. 7/10 because it was not extraordinary but it was good.",Buffalo '66
198,fingers78,"""Let's span time""...NOT!",3,17 October 2006,"*SPOILERS* Gallo-you either like him or you don't. His Billy Brown is a patronizing and narcissistic mess of a protagonist. Had I not seen Buffalo '66 on hired DVD in the comfort of my own home, I probably would've walked out of the theater somewhere round the twenty minute mark. And, I never walk out of films. Gallo's Brown is quite simply repugnant, and impossible to tolerate over the film's 105 minute running time. I was distraught when I found that Billy's suicide was only imagined and not real. Truly and utterly betrayed! Ricci is OK, but you can tell she's disinterested. Her Layla is nothing more than a metaphor for Billy's emotional baggage. Weak, very weak. Although the film was moderately well written, and the score complimented the skewed tone of the film, this was a disappointment. Rourke is brilliant and underused as usual. Gazzara and Huston are also excellent. It's as if Gallo needed to liberate himself with this, his most personal film. I imagine him watching it over and over again in a quiet little room, trying to understand and interpret his idiosyncrasies on screen; to fathom who and what he is. Make no mistake, Gallo did this for himself and not for you and I. This is selfish film-making at it's best.",Buffalo '66

It has a good start, but as it progresses, we only see Billy's development (kind of), while Layla just plays the naive teenage girl. We are given no explanatiom to why she likes Billy, or how she just goes off with Billy for a whole day, like, does she even have parents? Christina Ricci played the part well, I just feel like they could've gone more in depth with her character. Also, the romance part of the story wasn't as convincing as they wanted to make it be.
The film focuses on Billy, who is by the way, a great character, but it ends by leaning on the romantic relationship of the two, which is just not good enough. I feel like the film would've been better if, after Billy almost kills himself and buys Layla hot chocolate and a heart-shaped cookie, he finds the room empty. And then maybe kills himself, idk. Or even if we just get to see some sort of an ending instead of a happy ever after being hinted, which, possibly, ruined the movie for me. It's a solid movie, but just isn't a kicker.",Buffalo '66

Are we supposed to feel sympathy for this character?  If that was Mr. Gallo's intent, he has failed.  I suppose he intended to show us how bad the main character could get and then show us why he was so bad via the portrayal of his parents.  I know many people's parents who were worse than these who turned out just fine.  So what is the reason the main character is so rotten?  Oh, maybe it was because the girl in the third grade didn't return his affections. This again gives us no reason for the main character, Billy Brown, to be such a jerk. The only saving grace of this movie is the characterizations offered by Ben Gazzara and Anjelica Houston.  They play the non caring, unaffectionate parents with dry abandon.  Supposedly Billy has finally met his soulmate in Layla played by Christina Ricci.  Here again there is no explanation or reason for her to embrace this criminal who has just kidnapped her.  Unbelievable ending to an unbelievable movie.  There are a few poignant moments when Billy and Layla finally lay together and embrace but by this point the movie has unravelled so that it just doesn't matter anymore.",Buffalo '66

207,john.kelly,A fantastic study in human loneliness.,10,2 May 2000,"I was blown away by this superb independent movie from Vincent Gallo.Both tragic and hilarious, the film is a magnificent study in human loneliness and man's desire to be accepted and loved by one's peers, in this case Billy's (Vincent Gallo) parents.Frankly, his parents aren't worth the effort and watching his attempts to find favour with them by kidnapping a pretty young woman (Christina Ricci) and making her pose as his wife is both touching and sad.I highly recommend this gem. In my opinion one of the best films from the late 90s.See it now.",Buffalo '66
208,madape,A brilliant dark comedy and drama.,10,7 July 2000,"Buffalo '66 is classic just for the sequence where Billy goes to his mom's house (and they only have ONE picture of him).  Vincent provides the script, the directing, the music, and the acting alongside a young Christina Ricci (has she ever been in a bad movie?) all at which he is quite good at.  The music helps create the dark, lonely feel of the film and Billy's personality.  Another thing I love about the movie is how you slowly learn more about the Billy's history through the flashbacks and yet Ricci's character (Layla) remains an enigma.  Nice ending too....check it out!",Buffalo '66
209,easymungo!,WOW!!!!,10,5 July 2000,"Vincent Gallo is a genious. Christina Ricci is both beautiful and talented in equal measures. Buffalo '66 is amazing. That's all that can be said. If you don't like this film, then you are really missing out on something special. There is no other film like it. Everyone involved should give themselves a great big pat on the back, and if I meet any of them, I will give them an appreciative lollipop.",Buffalo '66
210,ars253,A really worthwhile movie about human interactions.,10,13 August 2000,"OK, my one line summary could have been a bit more descriptive, but at its crux, that's what this movie is about, human interactions. The plot, when summarized sounds forced and trite, but in fact is neither of those. Because of this, and since it's available elsewhere I won't bother with a recapitulation here. In fact, its unnecessary since this movie has more to say than its plot. Billy, the title character played by Vincent Gallo is the product of a family which stretches the meaning of the word ""dysfunctional."" So it is no surprise that he ends up in jail, although the method by which he becomes incarcerated is. Like much of this movie, it is unpredictable, but believable-much like reality. At any rate, after his release from prison he meets, or rather kidnaps, Layla, played by the ever-talented Christina Ricci, and forces her to play the role of his wife for a visit to his parents' house. Billy's life stands here at the figurative crossroads, his past represented by his parents, a future by Layla. The movie's carefully crafted focus power of human relations to alter one's life and oneself at every turn makes this a fine film worthy of close attention.",Buffalo '66
211,valceanu,This movie is a small masterpiece.,10,11 July 2003,"Buffalo '66 is a truly beautiful film.Vincent Gallo turns in a fine, complex performance as troubled loser Billy who is saved by the love of Layla, played with angelic perfection by Christina Ricci. Complementing his great acting, Gallo also did a superb job in directing the film, writing the script and making most of the soundtrack music.The other actors also rock. Ben Gazzara and Anjelica Huston are phenomenal as Billy's parents. Mickey Rourke and Jan Michael Vincent both contribute delightful cameos. And Kevin Corrigan gives us a marvelous uncredited performance as Billy's dull-witted buddy Goon, who decides he wants to be known as Rocky.Nothing about this movie is pat or predictable, and it just gets better and better with each viewing. It's easily on my top 10 list. Gallo has earned a place in the pantheon of great film makers with this piece.Finally, this movie most definitely has a point: Love can save us from ourselves.",Buffalo '66
212,pulp-19,the most human love story ever!,10,20 October 2000,"Ok first I would like to pre-empt what I want to say with the fact that Vincent Gallo wrote the original screenplay,adapted it,directed starred and was heavily involved in the music and costume for this film. That for me justifies all of the comments I have read from Gallo about this film. Sure he may come across as arrogant in interviews, although I would say most of the time a lot of what he says is firmly tongue in cheek but in any case I think his film speaks for itself.Quite simply it is the most amazing film I have seen. if any film deserves the kind of pretentious plaudits that film critics roll out for many of the foreign art house movies this is it. Go look at the back of the ""three colours"" series of films by Kieslowski and read the comments made and they will sum up this film better than I can.If you have read some of the other comments people have made about this film then you will already know about the incredible cinematography. It really does stand out from the opening scene when Billy desperately seeks the bathroom. Showing him from multiple camera angles as he first takes the bus then darts around the car park. However what really stands out for me is the characters, especially Billy. As one comment I read mentioned this is a great study in loneliness. You really get to feel Billy's pain. He has developed this outer shell to protect him, make him seem tougher than he really is. At times though we are allowed glimpses as this shell get pierced and he shows little bits of his innerself, which as you would expect is far more fragile. I think this is what layla sees in him. She sees the little boy inside who just wants to be noticed by his family and ultimately loved. SPOILER ALERT I could go on and on about this movie, none of which would probably be very critically well researched or written but would at least show the passion i feel for this film. There are so many classic scenes, the ""spend time,"" ""couple that like each other but dont touch each other"" photo scene, the ""Billy I'm cold"" bathroom bit and the way Billy lies on the very edge of the bed until the two slowly and beautifully link hands. These latter scenes really display Billy's vulnerability and are amongst my favourite ever. Equally the bit where he tells Goon he will kill him if he goes near his bowling ball etc and then tells him how hes met this girl and she loves him, that is one of the greatest and most touching ever. We get to see the rough exterior as he rounds on his friend and then his otherside, almost immediately afterwards to compensate. he does that a lot during the film, shouts then apologises. Finally the end when hes in the donut shop is agonizing, if like me you are involved in the two characters and want that happy ending you will see what I mean.I have never seen a movie that displays such a human side to love.Personally I am heavily into romantic films like pretty woman and of course all the john hughes eighties boy gets girl movies like ""some kind of wonderful"", ""pretty in pink"" et al. those were fun and always ended happily but they were glossy and unrealistic. The only competition as far as I can see in terms of a human romantic film would be ""say anything"" which is also awesome but lacks the indepth characters and grittiness.  Nothing I have yet seen can compete with Gallo's movie.If you dont believe me then try and get hold of a copy of Neon, the old but classic and best in my humble opinion movie mag. I'm sure they would do a much better job of convincing you than I can but regardless go get this movie, you will be surprised i guarantee it and you are really in for a treat, a true classic.Now if only i hadnt given my copy to a guy who now lives somewhere in Spain!",Buffalo '66

The air-conditioning was blasting, as it always does in Hong Kong. The cinema was freezing. When Billy was on the park bench outside the prison, I could have been sitting across from him, in my light clothing, watching him sleep.The film is brilliant. I had the added bonus of Climate Control that only added to the whole experience of Buffalo 66.

214,jbtrace,This is not one to see.,1,4 August 2006,"Vincent Gallo can't write, direct or act. Too bad, because he had a pretty good cast to work with and a plot that could have worked. And while the stark scenes of some Buffalo streets are authentic, they hardly represent the Buffalo I know. The family homestead looked to be Cheektowaga or Tonawanda, not Buffalo, for example. Huston and Gazzara came across as real Western New Yorkers but Gallo didn't seem to belong to them. Dysfunctional as this family was, Gallo's Billy Brown didn't seem to be their son. That might have been the intent of the casting, but for me it didn't work. I found this to be a putrid production that does a disservice to the City of Buffalo.",Buffalo '66
215,DavidSchofield,"Believable, Biographical tale of two lovers",8,2 January 2007,"A slow film to watch and took a little getting used to. Does not have the special FX and action that most films these days have, so no overloaded eyes and ears but a calm and compelling drama about two lonely people that are pushed together.I found the story line convincing while the two lead actors were strong and well played out. The camera work flowed well and came across in an almost biographical style leading the viewer to feel closer to the characters.If you like vanilla, then your gonna love this! - I highly recommend this.",Buffalo '66
216,tbentley85,superb cinematography,9,6 November 2006,"I love the camera work in this movie. Lance Acord (the cinematographer ...he was also the cinematographer of ""Lost In Translation"" etc.) did an excellent job. If you watch, Billy Brown is often perfectly framed in a balanced background of color and shape. The dinner table sequence shows him framed between wall lamps. The payphone scene at the dance studio frames him between a black bathroom door, and a black payphone etc. Lance Acord also emphasizes vertical lines (most obviously in the parents home and the hotel sequences). Lance used two extremes of camera angle frequently in this film. He used very objective shots from high angle and side view, which help emphasize the themes of winter, cold and impersonal contact. Examples of these objective shots include the high angles of the opening sequence when Billy is being released from prison, when Billy is trying to pee behind the black car, and Billy taking the kidnapped Layla to her car. Another high angle (although not a long shot like the previously mentioned) is when we get the ""ceiling fan"" point-of-view as Layla and Billy rest on the hotel bed. One particular tracking objective shot from side view is when Billy is crossing the highway to get to Scott Wood's club. But Lance Acord also used some extremely subjective angles during conversations. The conversation between Billy and Layla in her car before visiting Billy's parents demonstrates the powerful dynamic achieved when the characters look directly into the camera lens. The subjective angles during the dinner table scenes let the viewer switch back-and-forth between each of the characters' points-of-view, and see through their eyes. Lance Acord also utilized long motionless takes to help build the constant tension in this film. Excellent examples of these long frozen takes include the conversation on the edge of the hotel bed, and the photo booth sequence. There is also intentional precision focusing of the camera, which creates haunting images, especially during extreme close-ups on Billy's face. The general lack of zooming and booming is a nice change of pace for the viewer of this film. This movie is a most see for lovers of the camera.",Buffalo '66
217,matt_ferrin,Gallo's Masterpiece,10,21 September 2001,"The beauty of this film is in two things. The more obvious is the art direction/cinematography. From the slow, mood setting opening of the film to the surreal stop-animation sequence in the strip club the movie emanated artistic originality. The other great feat that Buffalo 66 accomplishes is the character development of the main character. Never have I known so little about the background of a character and cared so much about him(or her). On top of that, Billy Brown is a complete jerk. But the viewer can't help feel either a connection to him or at least sorry for him. And, in the end, you find your self really concerned about the decisions he makes . I hope that Gallo's got another Buffalo '66 in him.",Buffalo '66
218,shagbliss,"Great, unpredictable scenes and dialogue. Excellent script.",10,9 October 2001,"A very abnormal love story with great twists and turns.  The cinematography is superb and captures a cold and somewhat dark/gritty feeling throughout the film.  The actors are exceptional within their roles, not to mention the great outfits they have.  Christina Ricci is stunning and shines in her blue dress and glittery shoes.  Her make-up also flows with her costuming and sheds great light on her character's personality.  In addition, Vincent Gallo's performance is deserving of as much praise as possible.

224,pwgilbert1980,Believe it or not... the perfect love story,9,30 August 2002,"Buffalo 66 is the sort of film that reaches an audience far too small, which is really not fair when you're talking about one this perfectly put-together. For the most part the film is a relatively cold experience, Billy Brown's relationship with his football crazed mum and emotionally retarded dad only adding to our strange sympathy with th 'hero' of the story. The fact that we can identify with such an unpleasant character (which in all fairness he is, bickering with every one about anything he can) is testament to the film's writing. But through this coldness is a sense of hopefulness I think, Billy wants to overcome his problem's both with his family and the men who landed him in jail, and making a new start.Gallo is great as Billy, his face etched with worry and stress and his mannerisms full of pent up aggression which he takes relieves verbally by way of rants at Ricci's character Layla about touching him, not being able to drive the car etc.The scene in the photo booth is fantastic, as is the feeling of dread at Billy's reaction when Layla tries her hand at bowling. Ricci also gives a good performance as the girl whose life just needed a jump start such as a kidnapping, the small talk between the two is very funny to watch. The final scene when Billy buys the cookies on the way back is just the finest ending of all time. It's not a big twist ending or even one that will stay in the memory long afterwards but it's heartfelt and really shows the change that has come to Billy's life.Please just watch the film and love the ending. That's all I ask.",Buffalo '66

The acting in this film was AWESOME(!!) especially Angelica Houston (she was so convincing as the Buffalo Bills fan/obsessed mom THAT I DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS HER for at least 20 minutes. Ditto for Mickey Rourke, though his role was smaller.) Also LOVED the interaction between Ricci and the dad character--again, it was very double-take, ""so real you can't believe it's them playing the role"" performances.Now this movie may have resonated with me because my husband is from Cheektowaga....I've see SO many of these characters and it had me laughing so damn hard just to see them on sceen. But, wow, my husband and I both think Vincent Gallo is extremely talented.

It's completely unbelievable that Layla would allow Billy to treat her in the manner that he does.

230,Yolandapod,Multilateral filmmaking at its best,10,4 November 2003,"the unique look of this film comes from the rare use of 35 mm reversal film stock that created the colors and look of ""the past"" for this film. gallos choice to use 16mm reversal for the flashbacks works well because it keeps with the overall feel of the film and provides a different look seperating the flashbacks from the central plot wihtout looking out of place or too different. the split screens and layering is a bit distracting but not to the point that it really bothers. me. the lighting for this film while a bit run of the mill was still probably really hard to do due to the tendencies of reversal stock to pick up and emphasize color. also the production design with the use of red looks really nice on the stock especially the scene when billy is looking for a bathroom and rounds the city block in his red boots next to a red fire hydrant with four red stoplights in the background. whether this shot intentionally included the redlights and fire hydrant i dont know but it works quite well.",Buffalo '66

I think this film is one of the most beautyful movies i have ever had the pleasure of watching. A hopeless story of utter loneliness. The performances are faultless, Christina Ricci and Vincent Gallo bein one of the most unlikely on-screen couples and pulling it off better then J-Lo and Ben Affleck could ever dream of. The atmosphere of enevitable doom keeps ur fingers crossed for Billy till the end. Pure sympathy for what this man has lived through. Some of the scenes are hard to watch(scenes with Billys parents,and when hes crying in the toilet). After i saw this film i had a new respect for Mr Vincent Gallo and await his next screen venture. This film goes to show true brilliance can be achived on a low budget. When i am unhappy or feeling depressed i put this film on for its vision of hope, the light at the end of the tunnle. i truly rate this film as one of the best i have ever seen and recomend it to anyone who has an open mind when it comes to cinema.",Buffalo '66

I really commend him for writing the screen play then going on to direct it and play it's leading role. The man even wrote and performed the greater part of the soundtrack. Gallo's commitment to his film idea is remarkable.I loved how simply written the script was as well as enjoyed the overall depth of the film. The casting choices were outstanding. Christina Ricci had an especially amazing performance during the scene featuring the song ""Moonchild."" The cinematography was right on for what I felt the film's overall feel was.I'd say definitely worth seeing if you like off-the-wall movies with original plots, scripts, and character ideas.

Maybe it needed more development.  Maybe i can easily believe it because i can relate to the character of billy and have experience with overly compassionate female individuals.

234,aProandaCon,The Greatest Romance Movie,10,9 June 2010,"You know Twilight? Where like, the guy is perfect and dreamy and all the teenage girls want to marry someone as perfect and dreamy as him? Yah, F that.When I showed my friend this movie his first response was ""What does she see in him?"" I was surprised. I didn't get what he didn't get. Yah, he's flawed. THAT'S THE POINT. It's easy to love someone who's perfect---anyone can do that. But to love someone so terribly insecure, wounded, paranoid, irritable, and a million other things--? That takes real love. Layla isn't weak for loving such a person, she is incredibly strong. Real life romance requires people being able to conquer the bad in order to grow, and that's what the whole entire point of this movie.Layla and Billy face their own, individual challenges.Layla has the emotional and social intelligence that apparently some of the audience lacks. Right from the beginning, right after their rough introduction, she sees through to his vulnerability when he is talking on the phone at the dance studio, telling lies about how he's at an expensive hotel. There is a sudden, short cut to her listening in on the bathroom, with a sad look on her face. She can see by the things that he pretends to be what he really is. Because if someone puts on an act, logic follows that's not what they are really like. So she sees him acting tough and high status, and uses simple powers of deduction to conclude that he is really sensitive and insecure. She doesn't fall in love with what he does but what he hides. What is hidden is his true self, and she lets him show it to her. She begins to see deeper into the reasons for his behavior when she is at his parents house. She is trying to talk to his parents and is being completely ignored. She gives a brief crushed and sympathetic look to the camera (Billy's perspective) before turning her attention to the TV as his mother commands her to ""watch this play."" She is extremely observant and knows how to give Billy a comfortable distance while simultaneously slowly coaxing him closer e.g. asking for a handshake and giving him a hug. Also when he indirectly confesses that he wasn't actually in a relationship with Wendy like he said he was, instead of calling him out or making him feel bad she asks afterward, ""Did you have any other girlfriends?"" This isn't the sign of a stupid, weak, one-dimensional character. She has a very contained personality, but she is the one who is more emotionally secure and stable, and acts as the rock that Billy never had. I thought it was all pretty obvious, but I guess if you're one-dimensional yourself, then yes, she's probably going to seem one-dimensional too.But the main focus is the challenge that Billy faces. While Layla is clear and upfront about her feelings, Billy has to struggle with a choice: to act on anger, hate and hurt, and to take his own life, or to take the path of love, get rid of his deep rooted negativity, and embrace life. He is faced with this struggle up until the last 5-10 minutes of the film, when he is face to face with the man who represents all the awful things in his life, and debates whether or not to shoot him and then himself. Throughout the whole movie he periodically tries to make good on his plans, calling the club, checking to see what time Scott Woods comes in, and so on. He has to wait, and spends this time with Layla. After looking Scott Woods in the face, and letting go of everything bad, you see a complete transformation into a sweet and happy man who has let go of his demons and found a reason to live. Love kept him from killing himself. Really, how more romantic can you get? I think another thing people have missed is the fact that it's supposed to be funny. It's a darker sense of humor, which I could see not everyone getting. But you're not supposed to take character flaws so seriously; they're exaggerated for comedic effect. And I want to say that I am from Buffalo, and he is dead on. I know people from Buffalo are mad at him, but come on, it's pretty much true. All the way from the houses covered in Bills merchandise to the annoying flat ""a"" in our accents which makes everyone else think we're Canadian. The whole movie has a consistent feel to it The bland and muted colors used throughout the film give it an ugly-beauty sort of feel which is very accurate to Buffalo's charm.This movie doesn't spell out for the audience everything they should think and feel. You have to interpret and analyze not the words of the conversations, but what they're trying to convey about the dynamics between people. The characters, motivations, feelings, are not force-fed, and I prefer it that way. If you aren't able to digest deeper meanings in movie, and need direct dialog and formulaic characters, then you have no business snooping around in independent films in the first place. And the whole entire thing was contingent on the last few minutes. If you don't sit down a watch a whole movie, what are you doing rating and reviewing it? Anyway---the reason why this movie is so great is because it doesn't try to push the common delusions that romance is all fairy-tales and bunny tails, but instead examines what love really is. Love isn't being rescued by Edward Cullen, it's being kidnapped by Billy Brown.",Buffalo '66

The atmosphere represented the damaged and self-conscious person's life. Creative and not filled with clichés. Just sometimes it felt like the director tried too hard to make the movie all art-sy with unusual kind of shots. All in all, I recommend to watch this film to everyone.",Buffalo '66
239,jpkahan-633-38806,"Quirky, fascinating and satisfying",10,21 January 2020,"I have seen thousands of movies but Buffalo '66 is one of my great favorites. No sex, no real violence just a very quirky relationship between Gallo and a girl who he picked up in order to impress his parents. The parents are wonderful!! As the film unfolds you appreciate more and more his motivations, which is not arbitrary but carefully crafted.",Buffalo '66
240,JMarioSilva,Favorite Film of all time,7,28 October 2014,"This is the kind of movie I could see in a museum. The shots were great, it made me feel like I was there the entire time. The intro I've watched a thousand times, it's the only part of the film that fascinates me the most. Vincent Gallos acting is really great. He's explosive and you never know what he's gonna do. It feel really natural. My favorite thing about the film is how far from a Hollywood movie it is. I was on the edge of my seat all the time to see if he would finally kiss the girl or have any sort of physical connection with her. It was near the end of the film and it still seemed like he wanted to kill himself. The ending was so great, in your typical Hollywood film there would have been a scene were the guy ran back to the apartment and kissed her and they cried together bullshit. but in this one you don't see any of that. When the last scene comes to a black out all you see is a photograph of them holding each other. It was beautiful.",Buffalo '66
241,DVanneste,Thin storyline for a mean self-absorbed loser bent on revenge,3,25 October 2005,"There's no story here. It's just the moody odyssey of a mean self-absorbed character feeling unloved and bent on revenge. Why the Christina Ricci character feels any compassion for him is unexplainable and unexplained. This is film-making made on a whim and a wing. There are some well done special effects during flashbacks and a flash forward but they should have been saved for a more compelling storyline. The film feels like a vanity project on Vincent Gallo's part as a tribute to his friends and family stuck in Buffalo. Gallo has a gaunt feral look about him that I imagine goes down well for those who champion outsiders, losers and ne'er-do-wells. For those who aren't taken in, don't waste your time with this film.",Buffalo '66
242,JBigPimpin69,Worst movie ever!,1,27 March 2005,"This was by far the worst movie I have ever sat through. Gallo's dialogue was nothing short of mind numbing as the conversations were riddled with repetition and conversations about the most inane things I've ever listened to. It was like being locked in a room with a ""chatty"" Alzheimer patient. I cannot believe someone actually gave Gallo money to produce this piece of garbage. On top of that, I really like Christina Ricci as an actress, but I really question what was going through her mind when she read this script and decided to take this part. She must have really fallen on hard times at that point. The title of this movie should have been ""Two Whack Jobs in Love."" I bet Satan plays this movie in Hell a lot just to torture souls.",Buffalo '66

244,roseisarose,"Off-beat, Dead-pan Delight, May 2005",8,6 May 2005,"It's fascinating that this movie has garnered such powerful reactions, both positive and negative and I would hope potential viewers take this into consideration before dismissing a gem.If you haven't seen this movie yet, than you just might be in for a rare treat. However, skip it if you like your movies conventionally 'pretty'. Artists know beauty isn't a standardized trait, as do some of us in the general population.Buffalo 66 became a favorite of mine from the first viewing, but I original hail from WNY, so maybe I'm biased. Regional flavors, however strong and be they Texan, Rust-belt, or otherwise also don't put me off. Angelica Houston absolutely nails a North Tonawanda accent; she must have stood in the aisle at Tops for about an hour to prepare. She captures it as perfectly as ever such a nasal inflection could be rendered, and hats off to her! As to eccentricity, the scene where Billy's father sings to Layla is a near effortlessly example that's likely to linger after the credits roll.Within my adopted town, I recommend this movie to all wondering why I left Buffalo behind (to anyone who dares mention recent Super bowls, I say: ""The Bills we're number 2!""). The movie is believable, although the thought of this just might be frightening to some.",Buffalo '66
245,rachel_hotchkiss,an instant classic?,9,16 December 2005,"Maybe not - but I can appreciate it anyway. This is quite the stylized film. It has a distinct look to it that is no doubt the mind's work of the obsessive director/writer/composer/actor Vincent Gallo. I feel that the brilliance of this film is definitely in the writing and directing and not in Gallo's performance. On screen, his character is awkward and leaves little to be desired. Bit by bit, we learn more about him and begin to pity his situation despite his crudeness. I love the look of this film and the controlled characterization. Christina Ricci delivers a strong performance but the real star is Gallo's talent for unintentionally hilarious banter in his writing. Billy Brown's incessant whining never ceases to crack me up. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys independent films with a somewhat darker sense of humor.",Buffalo '66
246,funnyvlad,Strange but good!,8,12 September 2006,"This movie touched me a lot. It could be cause I saw myself in Billy Brown and I don't talk about his criminal past and manner. It is hard to explain. His metamorphosis through the movie was unexpected and triumphant. Layla is such a sweet girl. She deserves happiness. Call me a naive romantic but I saw sequences of my life passing by the last 30 minutes of the movie. It made me cry(and I am a full grown man). Movies rarely touch me so strong that this one did. Even besides this fact it is a really good movie with atypical picture and direction. All the characters in the movie are well impersonated and mostly authentic. Some characters are a bit exaggerated(not Layla and Billy though) but without the exaggeration this movies would possible be less interesting. Billy Browns character may sometimes sound unnecessary clear(he repeats himself) which could be annoying but then again, it is just a movie, a good such.",Buffalo '66
247,rickc-7,Very Much Like Parents In Some Of Our Own Families,9,15 September 2005,"Vincent Gallo is consistent in the lead role as a quirky, newly-released but innocent ex-con. Christina Ricci, as the voluptuous ballet student, is a good foil to Gallo's intensity. Travelling to Vince's parents in the girl's compact car cleverly symbolizes his humble desperate state. The negative qualities of Vince's dysfunctional parents are unfortunately very often present in many middle-class, suburban American homes, which I think is the main point of this movie. The plot is easy to understand. Vince's semi-developmentally disabled buddy is charming--both his and Ricci's characters serve to let Vince know that if something bad happens to Vince, it will greatly affect them, too. Micky Rourke is awesomely fascinating as the mobster. The production is low-budget and a bit long in spots, and the ending too simplistic after a very satisfying climax, but for a ""concept film"" breaking new ground, these objections seem trivial.",Buffalo '66
248,born_jesus,buffalo,10,28 December 2005,"I first saw the movie one Sunday night on TV and i didn't pay attention,but the other Sunday the same channel was playing it again and i watched it from the beginning and never stopped until the end.Buffalo 66 is very strange and poetic movie.The whole atmosphere and the photography are outstanding.The plot is just going on with no rush,it just natural.Gallo meets ricci and in the next scene they r together like she was waiting him for ever to get her out of her misery.And she is just following him.I think that gallo provides values and feelings as love and revenge with such a natural way that if you are used to big budget Hollywood films with the same theme u will be surprised. Anyway this film is special piece of art and independent cinema.It is close to be cult..",Buffalo '66
249,sarahxoxo,Love this movie,10,2 January 2007,"I love this movie. Its so cute and shows realness. Gallo is a great actor and he did very well in this movie. Its one of my favorites. I love how he likes the chick played by Christina Rici but at the same time he doesn't trust her and he doesn't want to show emotion and be vulnerable. This movie is great. Its funny. I haven't seen it in a while but I remember much of it. It says I have to put 10 lines of text in here but I don't want to spoil the movie so I'll just tell you there is many funny quotes from this movie. Gallo plays a strange character that you just gotta feel sorry for but at the same time you just wish he would be nicer to Christina's character. They do a lot of ""spanning time"" ha ha. Just spanning time. Great movie. Just watch it.",Buffalo '66
