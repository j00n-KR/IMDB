0,TheLittleSongbird,One of the worst movie musicals,2,27 January 2011,"Not the worst mind you, my bottom three are Xanadu, Can't Stop the Music and Mame. But Grease 2 is down there with the worst. As a lover of musicals and of music and film in general, I disliked this movie significantly. Just for the record, I really like Grease, it isn't in my top 250 nor is it my favourite movie musical, plus it is a movie that has grown on me over-time, but it was good spirited, energetic, nostalgic fun with fun performances and great songs and choreography.Grease 2 has very little of that. In fact, it is almost the exact anti-thesis of Grease, it is dull, lifeless and predictable with poor songs and forgettable performances. The only real point of interest is Michelle Pfeiffer, while her acting and singing is nothing amazing she does look gorgeous and does try, bless her heart. It is just a shame that the other performers are so lacking in chemistry and energy, and she and the cast are further disadvantaged by songs with irritating lyrics and unmemorable melodies, barely tolerable singing(I've heard worse such as in Mame and At Long Last Love but it is still bad here) and slip-shod choreography.The dialogue is also very embarrassing, there isn't a witty or quotable line here, in fact I found myself rolling my eyes at some of the cheesiness. The story is predictable, badly paced and dull as well, and spoiled by cardboard characters who don't interact with each other very well at all. Worst is the direction, it is absolutely wretched. Patricia Birch doesn't seem to have an idea how to direct this movie, and when anything interesting or worthwhile happened which was occasionally, it is spontaneously hampered by some hideous camera shots.All in all, a mess of not only a musical but of a film. 2/10 Bethany Cox",Grease 2
1,bkoganbing,"The ""G"" That Stands For Grease",4,5 July 2009,"The tenuous connection between this film and the first Grease is established right at the beginning of the film when Didi Conn one of four cast members repeating their roles approaches young Maxwell Caulfield who is a British exchange student. Although in the previous film Olivia Newton St. John's foreign speech pattern is not explained, it's explained here Caulfield is her cousin. What's Conn still doing in school, I guess she just likes hanging around Rydell High even though now she's a beautician.Caulfield's a smart kid, so of course the hood types led by Adrian Zmed have him labeled as a nerd. And that's especially bad when Zmed's girl friend decides she likes Caulfield. But being a nerd just isn't going to cut it.That's when Caulfield decides to put on a modern day Zorro act. He gets a junked bicycle and puts it back together and teaches himself to ride. He gets himself a leather biker outfit with a set of goggles to hide his face. If getting Michelle Pheiffer is not in the cards, Caulfield won't have any trouble making friends at any gay male leather bar the way he's outfitted.Grease 2 introduced Michelle Pheiffer and Maxwell Caulfield and started them on the successful career paths both have enjoyed. If you saw the first Grease film, a much better film, than you definitely have an idea how this film will turn out.In addition to Conn, Eve Arden, Sid Caesar, and Dody Goodman, all faculty members from the original Grease return in their roles. The music score isn't remotely as good as the songs that come from the original.It's not that Grease 2 is bad, it's just not all that great.",Grease 2
2,Leofwine_draca,Waste of time sequel,3,11 April 2016,"This musical follow-up to the smash hit GREASE is an example of how not to make a sequel. It seems like a slavish copy of the first film, complete with the falling in love romantic plotting at the heart of the storyline, the rival gangs, the high school mischief and the like. However, the iconic songs from the first film are gone, replaced by forgettable fluff pieces of music clearly written to recall former glory days. None of them has the same zing or vibrancy that made the ones in the first film such a hit.The acting just isn't of the same calibre either. As a British viewer, I found Maxwell Caulfield's performance wooden, and Michelle Pfeiffer's little better. In fact, Pfeiffer usually seems to disappoint, only seeming to snap out of average-ness on occasion, SCARFACE and STARDUST being two of the times she seems to be making an effort. While I appreciate the attention that has been made to period detail and enthusiasm, but GREASE 2 is a waste of everyone's time.",Grease 2
3,SnoopyStyle,some fun camp value,4,21 February 2016,"It's two years after the original Grease. It's Back to School Again. Stephanie Zinone (Michelle Pfeiffer) leads The Pink Ladies but she can't stay with the immature Johnny Nogerelli (Adrian Zmed), leader of the T-Birds. Sandy's British cousin Michael Carrington (Maxwell Caulfield) has come to Rydell High. He is joined by Frenchy who returns to finish chemistry so that she can start her own cosmetics company. Michael falls for Stephanie but she's looking for a Cool Rider. Michael starts doing assignments for money and fixes up an old motorcycle. When the rival Cycle Lords confront the T-Birds, Michael comes to the rescue hidden under a helmet and Stephanie falls for the mystery rider.This is a campy return to Rydell High. There are a couple of good songs and some bad ones. I like Cool Rider for the chorus. This is much more like a high school musical production. Michelle Pfeiffer is one of the sexiest woman in movie history but there is something very campy about her doing song and dance. She's way too cool to do this. Meanwhile, Maxwell Caulfield is way too much of a pretty boy. He's literally drawing hearts in his notebook. They made him too sappy. I don't mind the story but the British guy could have been James Bond. The story is mostly functional. Michelle and Maxwell are pretty people but there isn't enough heat. This is basically bad but some of it is fun bad.",Grease 2
4,mark.waltz,Left behind stains no sequel should leave on an original.,3,16 August 2016,"Frenchie is back and so are some of the adults, but the magic is gone in the most unnecessary of movie sequels. It reverses the good girl loves bad boy story but left out smart humor, decent plot moving songs and most of all, chemistry between its two leads. Michelle Pfeiffer went onto much better things, but it started off disastrously here, with Maxwell Caulfield dull, dull, dull as the cousin of the unseen Sandy who is taken in by high school returnee Didi Conn. Adrian Zmed and Lorna Luft are among the other teens, looking closer to that age but lacking in decent material.So it's up to Eve Arden, Dody Goodman and Sid Caesar as the faculty and staff, joined by a campy Connie Stevens who looks like she came back in time from a future production of ""Hairspray"" and laughably Tab Hunter as her love interest.A great opening number (""Back to School"") sets the tone for what never comes. Each musical number seems like it could be removed and make no impact, with the luau number at the end just wretched. This is part of a double DVD set of the original which I would recommend avoiding just in case this one ends up playing instead of this fiasco.",Grease 2
5,gavin6942,Some Wild Cheese!,5,6 February 2016,"An English student at a 1960s American high school has to prove himself to the leader of a girls' gang (Michelle Pfeiffer) whose members can only date greasers.I might be the only one who enjoys ""Grease 2"" more than ""Grease"". Not because it is a better movie. To me, they are both bad movies and this is the lesser of the two. But it also happens to be much more fun, because it is so much cheesier and more over the top. You cannot take this movie seriously, as is obvious from the dancing through the opening.If anything could have been improved, it would be to have another returning cast member. I believe only Frenchy returned, which seems a bit strange, because you would think most of the teachers would be the same. But who knows what they were thinking?",Grease 2
6,jboothmillard,Grease 2,3,12 June 2016,"When I found out there was a sequel to the highly successful Grease, and the leading actress starring in it, I was certainly most intrigued to see what it would be like, especially reading the many negative reviews. Basically it is 1961, two years after the original T-Birds and Pink Ladies graduated, there's a new crop of senior students at Rydell High. The Pink Ladies are now led by Stephanie Zinone (Michelle Pfeiffer), her boyfriend is arrogant and rather immature new T-Birds leader Johnny Nogerelli (Adrian Zmed), their relationship is going sour. Clean-cut British student Michael Carrington (Maxwell Caulfield), he is the cousin of Sandy Olsson (from the previous film), she asked Frenchy (Didi Conn) to show him around and introduce him, Frenchy has returned to get her diploma and hopes to start a cosmetics company. Michael is quickly smitten when he meets Stephanie, she goes to a bowling game with Johnny, there is animosity between them, Stephanie retaliates by kissing the next man who walks through the door, who happens to be Michael. Bemused by the kiss, Michael asks Stephanie out, but she has specifics on her ideal man, she wants a ""cool rider"", he realises he will only win her affection turning himself into a cool rider, so to pay for a motorcycle he is paid by the T-Birds to write papers for them. At the bowling alley, the T-Birds are surprised by a gang of rival motorcyclists called the Cycle Lords, most of whom are members of the defunct Scorpions, led by Leo Balmudo (Dennis C. Stewart), before a fight starts, a lone anonymous biker appears, it is Michael in disguise, he defeats the enemy gang and disappears, Stephanie is fascinated by the stranger. Stephanie is surprised again at the garage when the Cool Rider appears, they enjoy a romantic twilight motorcycle ride, the T-Birds and Pink Ladies interrupt Michael as he is about to reveal his identity, before he leaves Michael says he will see Stephanie again at the talent show, Johnny is enraged and says he will fight the Cool Rider if he see him again. Stephanie gets poor grades, and Michael offers to help, Johnny sees them in discussion and demands Stephanie to quit the Pink Ladies for his ""rep"", she is still head over heels for the Cool Rider, but she has become smitten with Michael as he is, he ponders whether to continue his secret identity. Stephanie and the Cool Rider meet at the talent show, but the T- Birds ambush and pursue him, with Stephanie and the Pink Ladies following in a car, the chase takes them to a construction site with a concealed deadly drop, with his disappearance the biker is assumed to have perished, Stephanie is left heartbroken and inconsolable, later at the talent show she has a dreamlike fantasy, where she reunites with the mystery biker. The school year ends with a luau, Stephanie won the talent contest and is crowned queen, Johnny is hailed as king, the Cycle Lords show up and destroying celebrations, the Cool Rider reappears and defeats the gang, and reveals himself as Michael. Johnny is initially shocked but welcomes him into the gang, Stephanie accepts she can be with him, all couples happily pair off at the seniors' graduation, and sing and dance together. Also starring Eve Arden as Principal McGee, Sid Caesar as Coach Calhoun, Christopher McDonald as Goose McKenzie, Lorna Luft, Judy Garland's daughter as Paulette Rebchuck, Peter Frechette as Louis DiMucci, Leif Green as Davey Jaworski, Maureen Teefy as Sharon Cooper, Alison Price as Rhonda Ritter and Dody Goodman as Blanche. Pfeiffer, who made her breakthrough in Scarface a year later, is reasonable as the short-skirted minx, Caulfield is only slightly interesting as the nice British guy and his cool motorcycle alter-ego, original cast members returning hardly adds anything to proceedings. I will admit I liked the opening song ""Back to School Again"" by the Four Tops, some of the other song and dance numbers are reasonable, but the love story is almost a repeat, with the roles reversed, it is essentially just reusing the elements of the original Broadway adaptation film, and the result is a tired and nearly boring to watch, I didn't hate all of it, but is is a terrible musical sequel. Adequate!",Grease 2
7,moonspinner55,"If it were any more a dog, it would need a flea collar",1,30 May 2001,"Boy-girl love affair/sequel with songs, only this time she's the punkette and he's the straight arrow. Movie-buffs out there actually like this movie? It has fans? I must say, the mind reels... ""Grease 2"" is a truly lame enterprise that doesn't even have the courage, moxy or sheer gall to take the memory of its predecessor down in flames (like ""Jaws 2"" or ""Exorcist II""). No, it whimpers along in slow-motion and often just plays dead. It looks and feels cheap, with a large cast lost amidst messy direction and unfocused handling. This was the first time a substantial audience got a glimpse of Michelle Pfeiffer and, although she doesn't embarrass herself, it's a role worth forgetting. A misfire on the lowest of levels. NO STARS from ****",Grease 2
8,studioAT,A greasy mess,2,12 April 2016,"Grease 2, the sequel nobody asked for actually lures you in with a sense of familiarity. There's a good opening number and lots of recognisable faces from the original film.But then it goes downhill and we see why John Travolta and Olivia Newton John decided not to don the leather jackets again.The plot is a basic retread of the original, only with weaker characters and less charismatic people playing them. I know Maxwell Caulfield gets a bit of stick for his wooden portrayal but Michelle Phfeiffer doesn't really fare much better. And poor old Didi Conn as Frenchy is in and out of the film more than a train through a tunnel.Apart from the opening song and 'cool rider' the rest of the songs are forgettable, much like this film.",Grease 2
9,bevo-13678,Awesome,10,30 March 2020,What a terrible movie you'd be mad to give it more the 3 stars out of 10 stars!!!!!!!!,Grease 2
10,preppy-3,Terrible but I've seen worse,2,18 May 2018,"Sequel to the inexplicably popular ""Grease"" !1978). It's 1961 and Maxwell Caulfield plays MIchael--an English student who comes to America to attend Rydell High. There he meets beautiful Stephanie (Michelle Pfeiffer before she hit it big) and falls in love. However she only dates bikers and he's not one.There's lots wrong with this movie. It's too long, all the high school kids look like 30, there's a few REALLY bad songs, the dialogue is terrible and most of the acting is horrid. On the other hand--most of the songs are great (LOVE the ""Reproduction"" number with Tab Hunter clearly enjoying himself), there are a few great huge production numbers with great dancing and singing and there's some good acting by Pfeiffer, Tab Hunter, Eve Arden (in her last film), Didi Conn and Lorna Luft. Also Caulfield is GORGEOUS and great to look at--even though he can't act. So it is bad but watchable.",Grease 2
11,Aaron1375,"A very unnecessary sequel...I want a cool rider, ugh.",2,20 March 2010,"Grease was successful, so why not make a sequel. Because some movies do not need sequels or warrant them. Grease was such a film. I would usually say how much I hate musicals at this point, but I do not feel the need as much with this one as most people out there hate this one too, not because it is a musical, but because it is an awful movie. The only thing one can say about this movie is that it has more of a plot than the original movie, other than that and the fact it has a young Michelle Phifer in it is about the only positive things one can say about this movie. The songs in this one are simply dreadful, when Phifer sings about how she wants a cool rider one can imagine all the dogs in the neighborhood lifting their heads and howling. Sadly that is probably one of the better songs in the movie. Stupid attempts at humor are made in the form of an awful bunker scene along with another horrible song and the whole film looks bad compared to the original. That film looked like it was set in the 1950's and had that feel. This one looks like it was shot in the 80's and only minimal things were done to make it feel like whatever era it was pretending to be in. Just nothing here to really see, except for a young cute Michelle.",Grease 2
12,Sylviastel,It was alright!,7,17 October 2006,"Before I saw the first Grease, me and my neighbor only saw Grease 2 because that's all HBO or Showtime aired at the time. Anyway, it introduced us to Michelle Pfeiffer and Maxwell Caulfield. The casting was excellent but they were trying to recreate the magic from the first Grease. I was glad to see some old favorites back like Eve Arden, Didi Conn as Frenchy, Dodie Goodman, Sid Caesar, Alice Ghostley, and new faces like Adrian Zmed, Lorna Luft (Liza's sister and Judy's daughter). There were some dumb scenes like when one of the Pink ladies and one of the guys got together thinking it would be the last. That was a silly medley but you can still watch and laugh. Of course, the plot was silly but it managed to make a somewhat decent sequel to a classic movie. The scene in the bowling alley was funny to watch. Alright, it wasn't the original but we got to see some old friends again.",Grease 2
13,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Oh, yeah, my high school totally broke out into songs and dances as well",2,26 August 2007,"Well, at least my theater group did, lol. So of course I remember watching Grease since I was a little girl, while it was never my favorite musical or story, it does still hold a little special place in my heart since it's still a lot of fun to watch. I heard horrible things about Grease 2 and that's why I decided to never watch it, but my boyfriend said that it really wasn't all that bad and my friend agreed, so I decided to give it a shot, but I called them up and just laughed. First off the plot is totally stolen from the first one and it wasn't really clever, not to mention they just used the same characters, but with different names and actors. Tell me, how did the Pink Ladies and T-Birds continue years on after the former gangs left? Not to mention the creator face motor cycle enemy, gee, what a striking resemblance to the guys in the first film as well as these T-Birds were just stupid and ridiculous.Another year at Rydell and the music and dancing hasn't stopped. But when a new student who is Sandy's cousin comes into the scene, he is love struck by a pink lady, Stephanie. But she must stick to the code where only Pink Ladies must stick with the T-Birds, so the new student, decides to train as a T-Bird to win her heart. So he dresses up as a rebel motor cycle bandit who can ride well and defeat the evil bikers from easily kicking the T-Bird's butts. But will he tell Stephanie who he really is or will she find out on her own? Well, find out for yourself.Grease 2 is like a silly TV show of some sort that didn't work. The gang didn't click as well as the first Grease did, not to mention Frenchy coming back was a bit silly and unbelievable, because I thought that she graduated from Rydell, but apparently she didn't. The songs were not really that catchy; I'm glad that Michelle was able to bounce back so fast, but that's probably because she was the only one with talent in this silly little sequel, I wouldn't really recommend this film, other than if you are curious, but I warned you, this is just a pathetic attempt at more money from the famous musical.2/10",Grease 2
14,Rainey-Dawn,Deserves a Second Watch,8,30 June 2014,"This is a good follow-up to the 1978 movie ""Grease"". Although it has gotten some bad reviews over the years, I still think the movie is a good comedy musical and it is just as much of a swooning romance as the first film. This film is desperately underrated on IMDb and deserves a second watch.What I really loved is the romance between gum-smacking bad girl Stephanie and the seemingly upper-classed and very intelligent Michael. The romance is very much like the first ""Grease"" story but in reverse but ""Grease 2"" is a romance story all of it's own.The soundtrack is not bad - in fact, it's quite good for a musical! There are not a whole lot of musicals where the songs are catchy like in both of the Grease films.Again, I think more people should give this movie another chance (viewing) and for those that have not seen Grease 2 - watch it and judge the movie for yourself instead of reviews! 8/10",Grease 2
15,thesar-2,"Sex, Lies and a ""Talent"" Show",2,27 December 2016,"Amazing on how little the creators of Grease 2 noticed that their school year began in September 1961 and ended the following year in 1961. Lazy or rushed, you decide.Look, I'm going to make this a quickie, much like all the horny ""kids"" here wanted. I only watched this movie to listen to the great podcast: ""How Did This Get Made?"" on my drive to Vegas in a couple of days. They covered this, so to join in on their fun, I watched it. I both curse and will eventually praise them.Truthfully, I wasn't a fan of the first film. I saw it waaay after the release. 30 years, to be precise. I only know this, because after listening to the incredible soundtrack for decades, I saw the movie was coming back to theatres for a 30th year anniversary in 2008. So, I figured that would be the best way to see it first: on the big screen. Andit was a big letdown. Sure, the music was still incredible, but the production of the movie: eh. And nowthat said, the first is a masterpiece in comparison to part 2.Random scenes, terrible music, an ultra-thin ""plot,"" and mid-20 to 30- year-olds posing as high school students? Well, at least it made all the teachers and faculty lusting over students less creepyI guess? Can't really give a synopsis since there didn't appear to be a script involved, but what it boiled down to: Foreign exchange student lusts over a forbidden ""girl,"" and since she only likes bikers, he pretends to be one so he can Clark Kent/Superman her. (He even mentions that duality at one point.)Admittedly, I found the music catchy at points, though it still sucked and most of the cast was really trying, though horribly directed. So, I didn't overall hate this, but boy it felt like it was put together in hours. The entire film, I mean.This movie and many more pointless sequels are proof that not every great ""classic"" needs a follow-up and obvious cash-cows don't always need milking. Shame.***Final thoughts: So glad, despite this, Michelle Pfeiffer had a career. She wasn't terrible in her first lead role here, but, boy, was she badly directed. I almost felt sorry for her as she was just horribly led.",Grease 2
16,slightlymad22,Enjoyable If You Let It Stand On It's Own,7,29 October 2014,"Is it as good as the original movie??, hell no!! But was it the best musical of 1982?? Ooops not a chance!! The Burt Reynolds and Dolly Parton romp ""The Best Little Whorehouse In Texas"" wins that by a mile.But is Grease 2 bad?? I don't think so, it's OK, if you take it as it's own movie and not compare it to the original. And that's where I think the movie fails, by having several characters from the first movie return such as Frenchie (Didi Conn) Eugene (Eddie Deezan) and ""Crater Face"" that they didn't need, you can't help but be reminded of the first movie. The only characters needed to return is the Prinicipal McGee (Eve Arden) her receptionist Blanche (Doody Goodman) and Coach Calhoon (Sid Ceasar) and even then Ceasar doesn't contribute much. It's has a lot of catchy songs and some fairly decent choreography most of the time. It does have it's share of awful songs (Prowling and Charades are especially dire) poor editing and some ridiculously disguised ramps for the motorbikes to ride up. Connie Stevens leaves an impression as the busty and flirty as Miss Mason.",Grease 2
17,sol-,A reversal of the original film's formula,5,14 December 2015,"Following in the footsteps of the box office success that was 'Grease', this less ostentatious sequel was almost destined to open to negative reviews. Some of the criticisms are admittedly on the mark. In particular, Didi Conn reprising her role as a post-graduation Frenchy never quite works; the attempt to link to the first 'Grease' film by making the male protagonist Sandy's cousin is also forced. 'Grease 2' is, however, a better film than one might expect from its reputation, and its reversal of the original movie's formula makes for a more engaging story. Whereas the first film was about an out-of-place teenage girl giving in to peer pressure and conforming to impress a guy, here it is the guy who has to conform to impress the girl. In both films, the message offered (conformity is good) is hard to swallow, however, as the transformation this time is more gradual (not all of a sudden at the end), it is easier to get under the skin of the protagonist here and feel for his mixed emotions. A refined Maxwell Caulfield also makes for a more appealing lead actor than John Travolta, who acted pretty smug throughout the whole of the first film, and while Michelle Pfeiffer is no better than Olivia Newton-John, she is certainly no worse on the acting front; singing is another matter. That said, the film has some pretty decent songs, even if they are nowhere near as iconic as the original's tunes; ""Turn Back the Hands of Time"" is a particularly beautiful tune. The film is surprisingly funny too with the school's kooky administration team given twice as much screen time here.",Grease 2
18,lisafordeay,Nowhere as good as the original Grease movie,4,2 March 2015,"I got this on DVD along with the first one so I watched it a few days ago. The film centers on a girl called Stephanie(Michelle Phiffer making her debut here)and she is part of the pink ladies. Of course there is this new student who arrives from the UK and he has a crush on her. Problem is his not her type and he develops this alter ego where he dons a leather jacket and a motorbike and makes his voice deeper so that Steph would have NO idea who the mysterious motorcyclist is? But how long can he keep up with the fascade to win over Steph's heart.Bottom line this movie is nowhere as good as the original. The songs are mediocre and they fly by you and you'd forget it was even a musical. Keep an eye out for the scene where there's a bunch of people running and these people are playing the trumpets,as the song Moon River from Breakfast At Tiffany's is been played by the people playing the trumpets.My rating a 4/10",Grease 2
19,rbverhoef,May be for Pfeiffer fans,2,30 November 2003,"This sequel to 'Grease' has two reasons to see it. Michelle Pfeiffer is the female lead and there is one nice song with the title Reproduction. Well, I liked the song but that all people will like. When I think about it, the song is almost as stupid as the movie.Don't see it because you liked 'Grease', which is so much better and so much more entertaining. Only see it if you like Pfeiffer.",Grease 2
20,Rob_Taylor,This dog shows up on TV from time to time.,1,22 December 2002,"Oh my God! This is the worst film since Aurora. You'd think that, when you do a sequel to such a classic as Grease, you'd at lest spend a little money on things like the script. You'd also think that they'd realise they'd have to do something special to have even a ghost of a chance of competing with the first movie. Not here. Just throw in a bunch of young actors, some cheap costumes and write a few lousy songs and you have the perfect recipe.......for a flop.I won't go on about all the really crass things in the film, except to say that the ending, with motorbikes jumping a pool, was truly pathetic.How sad to see Michelle Pfeiffer in this. Thankfully it didn't sink her career - she can count herself very lucky there. Adrian Zmed also hammed it up terribly and looked to be about four feet tall through most of the film.Twenty years ago, and still this dog shows up on TV from time to time.",Grease 2
21,CitizenCaine,Grease 2 Too Much Of A Bad Clone,4,25 September 2009,"Patrica Birch, the choreographer from the original Grease, tried her hand at directing in this sequel to one of the biggest box office hits of the 1970's. It was the first and last feature film she would direct to date. The film had a troubled production history from the get go, as John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John were rejected after opening talks to resume their roles from the original film. I would guess they probably wanted too much money. After that, it was all down hill as actresses and actors rejected the film left and right. Michelle Pfeiffer finally took the role of Stephanie Zinone and Maxwell Caulfield the role of Michael Carrington. The film has many of the familiar faces of the original, including Didi Conn as Frenchy, Eve Arden as Principal McGee, Dody Goodman as Blanche Hodel, Sid Caesar as Coach Calhoun, and Eddie Deezen as Eugene Felnic. Tab Hunter and Connie Stevens are on hand as teachers.What the film doesn't have is the infectious energy of the original and star power. After the opening number ""Back To School Again"", the musical numbers fall flat and are less inventive. Maxwell Caulfield, although good-looking, has zero charisma. Michelle Pfeiffer's character is annoying after a while, and her T-bird boyfriend (played by Adrian Zmed in his film debut) is just obnoxious. The film has several production errors which are obvious to even some casual observers, such as the motorcycles dated ten years or more after the time of the film (1961) and the multi-colored basketballs from the ABA several years before they were introduced. This film actually almost broke even in the end, despite its poor reputation, but its lack of mega-success put the kibosh on more planned sequels and a television series. *1/2 of 4 stars.",Grease 2
22,dglink,A Ravishing Pfeiffer and a DOA Caulfield in Musical Dud,4,16 February 2008,"Hollywood's misguided obsession with sequels has resulted in more misfires than hits. For every ""Godfather II,"" there are dozens of ""More American Graffiti's,"" ""Stayin' Alives,"" and ""Grease 2's."" While the original ""Grease"" is not a great film, the 1977 adaptation of the long-running Broadway hit does have songs evocative of the 1960's, energetic choreography, and an appealing cast. When Paramount began work on a follow-up, the producers came up nearly empty on every aspect that made the original a blockbuster.Fortunately for moviegoers, Michelle Pfeiffer survived this experience and evidently learned to read scripts before signing contracts. Her talent and beauty were already evident herein, and Pfeiffer does seem to express embarrassment at the humiliating dance routines and tuneless songs that she is forced to perform. Maxwell Caulfield, however, lacks even the skill to express embarrassment, and his emotions run the gamut from numb to catatonic. What romantic interest, beyond hormones, could the cool sassy Pfeiffer have in the deadpan Caulfield? That dull mystery will linger long after the ludicrous luau finale fades into a bad memory. Only cameos by veterans such as Eve Arden, Connie Stevens, and Sid Caesar have any wit, although Lorna Luft does rise slightly above the lame material.Reviewers have complained that, because ""Grease 2"" is always compared to the original, the movie comes up lacking. However, even taken on its own terms, the film is a clunker. After a frenetic opening number, which evidently exhausted the entire cast, the energy dissipates. With few exceptions, the original songs bear little resemblance to the early 1960's, and the only nostalgia evoked is for ""Our Miss Brooks"" and ""Sid Caesar's Comedy Hour."" The jokes fall flat, and the choreography in a film directed by choreographer Patricia Birch is clumsy to be polite. However, worse films have been inflicted on audiences, and inept sequels will be made as long as producers seek to milk a quick buck from rehashing blockbusters. Unfortunately, ""Grease 2"" is not even unintentionally funny. Instead, the film holds the viewer's attention like a bad train wreck. Just when all the bodies seem to have been recovered, the next scene plunges into even worse carnage.",Grease 2
23,TOMASBBloodhound,Poor casting doomed this one from the start.,5,27 January 2013,"Grease 2 is one of the most ridiculed sequels of all time, and though it pales to the original, its certainly better than the rating would imply. The film is just more musical numbers and hijinks from the kids at Rydell High. Only this time, the new kid on the block is a guy trying to impress a cool chick. As opposed to a goody-two-shoes girl trying to win over a cool guy like we saw in the original. There are some cute songs and funny moments, but the two leads (Caulfield and Pfeiffer) just cannot live up to Olivia Newton-John or John Travolta. Not even close. First of all, neither can sing terribly well, and generally you'd like your leads in a musical to be able to sing. It really helps. Caulfield is somewhat more likable in the underdog role, but Pfeiffer's acting is really poor. She was a pretty face and little more at that point of her career. Her song ""Cool Rider"" is one of the film's worst. While singing it, she does look kind of sexy while climbing up to the top of a ladder and then straddling it. But then when she gets down she starts doing something resembling the Elaine dance from Seinfeld. Thumbs in the air and all! Weird. Director/choreographer Pat Birch should have fixed that.There are some good performances from some of the folks playing the T-Birds and Pink Ladies. Adrian Zmed provides some chuckles with his false bravado in many scenes. Chris McDonald who plays the Goose has been a solid performer in movies and TV for years. And you're telling me Lorna Luft is a daughter of Judy Garland? Who new? Its good to see some of the faculty members are back from the original, but Didi Conn doesn't seem to belong. It seems like the producers agreed and just kind of wrote her out of the movie by the third act.It's really kind of odd how this movie has been aired seemingly more than the popular original over the years. It didn't hurt Pfeiffer's career (nor did marrying producer David E. Kelly), but this movie destroyed Caulfield's before it even began. He has kept somewhat busy, and was even considered at one point for the James Bond role. But he's never been the star he perhaps could have been. Grease 2 isn't all bad. It's worth about 5 of 10 stars.The Hound.",Grease 2
24,tbills2,Grease 2 - (the sequel to) THE BEST MUSICAL EVER!,5,16 July 2013,"I love Grease 2! Going in to watching Grease 2 and expecting to see a musical sequel live up to the strong likes of Grease will certainly cause you to breakdown sobbing uncontrollably calling for your mommy all within a first few minutes of the film, but it's really NOT, all that bad well ya it is but still, it's a forgivable bad. Grease 2 is very ingratiating, just like Grease, but in a different vibe. The sequel just never has any chance at being as good as Grease, but still Grease 2 is such a guilty pleasure of mine. It's really not that bad. It's playful, very decent mild-mannered merriment. The songs are...so worse than the songs of Grease...let's not say that, let's say they're catchy good. I love the songs of Grease 2 even though they're not all that good, or on second thought, maybe they are good, I dunno, I do love them, I mean.....no...no they're definitely, definitely not that good. My favorite Grease 2 tunes are ""Back To School Again"", ""Score Tonight"", and ""Cool Rider"". I love, love, love Michelle Pfeiffer starring and singing and performing in Grease 2. Without the worthwhile Michelle Pfeiffer there's really no telling how bad it might have got. Grease 2 is enjoyable at times though it is consistently bad, but it isn't too unsavory and it tries so good. It earns a good 5 rating wholly on its fun, lighthearted goodness, and for the presence of Pfeiffer. If I love Grease 2 this much, please understand just how much it is that I love Grease......sooooooooo, so very much.",Grease 2

Who is Maxwell Caufield? Is the appropriate word foisted? As is Maxwell Caufield was foisted upon film-going audiences in 1982? Sounds like the right word, foisted, or maybe fisted. Michelle Pfiffer, she is a woman, the nicest thing I can say about her performance in Greasy Tube, she has female genitalia. For some reason this movie is a musical, a musical about depression. So in Greasy 1, there is some subtlety about the sexual undertones of each musical number, in Greasy Deuce, there is no subtlety, none.

The first Grease movie was made in 1978 and despite it was a successful movie because it was very popular when it reached the cinemas in the 1970's.

Four years later after the first film him, in 1982 a sequel was bound to happen with the same movie title with a 2 at the end.It's Grease 2! Same plot, different characters, new songs. Those are the key factors in Grease 2 where after the first song ""Back to School"", we are introduced to Michael Carrington (Maxwell Caulfield) an exchange student from England who happens to be the cousin of Sandy (Olivia Newton John from the original) where he doesn't fit quite yet with Rydell High while being pushed around by a new pack of T-Birds with leader Johnny (Adrian Zmed) and his guys giving him a hard time. Michael falls for a girl named Stephanie (Michelle Pfeiffer in her film debut) in which she likes him but it'll be against the ""code"" since she's a pink lady (just like in the original) and don't go out with anybody but T-birds. What will Michael have to do to win Stephanie's heart? Grease 2 manages to bring back a couple of recognized faces from Didi Conn, who played Frenchy in the original, with just a few lines to Eddie Deezen whose known to fans as the geek Eugene. Sid Ceasar is the coach; Dody Goodman is Blanche; Eva Arden is Miss McGee and Dennis Stewart returns as the bully to Rydall. The film isn't the same as the original where the t-birds are more like sweet players (gentlemen) than rebels badmouthing the teachers.

I don't think anyone else has attempted a movie musical sequel, but as efforts go this one isn't too bad. Some original cast members return with the new faces, but this film for all it's charm, just lacks the sheer magic and energy of the original.Michael Carrington (Maxwell Caufield), Sandy's cousin, arrives at Rydell High. After receiving tips for school survival from first Frenchie (Didi Conn) and then Eugene (Eddie Deezen) he falls for Stephanie (Michelle Pfeiffer), head of the Pink Ladies gang. She's recently split up with the head of the T-Birds Johnny (Adrian Zmed), and is yearning for something better...The plot is an exact replica of the original, with sexes flip-flopped, motorcycles replacing cars and the cheese turned up. Sometimes this works (the musical numbers, while not terrific, are at least well-staged and performed with enough enthusiasm). Sometimes it doesn't work, as Adrian Zmed is a little too polished and smug to totally convince as Johnny and Eugene's role has been beefed up a little too much to the point where his perpetual nerdiness is irritating.It is still good fun, but the original was simply so much better and this film's mere existence only proves this.",Grease 2

He eventually wins over the leader of the Pink Ladies (Michelle Pfeiffer, right before SCARFACE) by posing as a mysterious biker who takes on the entire rival motorcycle gang.A couple of catchy songs (""Back to School"" and ""Reproduction"" are both fun) cannot compete with a moronic screenplay (by the same guy who wrote and directed AIRPLANE II), dreadful performances and some abysmal songs (particularly ""Let's Score Tonight,"" ""Who's That Guy"" and ""Cool Rider"").Pretty much an embarrassment for everyone involved, especially such wasted talent as Connie Stevens, Eve Arden and Sid Caesar.

32,happipuppi13,Grease 2 ; The Rydell Hype,5,12 March 2016,"When I was 14, I saw this movie over summer vacation. Naturally, having seen Grease and like anyone else who saw it, I didn't think it possible to make a sequel.Either 'at all' or to make one that wasn't as good as the first. Now at that age, I did like the movie and understood it wouldn't star Travolta or Olivia Newton John (who were too busy making so-so or even worse films at the time.) I'm in my 40s now and I got to re-watch this last night, for the first time in about 11 years or so. First, sorry to all of you who truly love this movie, if you love it that's fine but I honestly can't like it as much as you do. ...but, you're welcome to your feelings.I feel the characters, some of the songs just don't have the heart that made ""Grease"" enjoyable for me.Unlike the first, it seems no one in this movie really cares about anyone but themselves and most of the dialog centers around sexual things...but! I can't totally dismiss it either. There are some good things in the movie, it's true. Too bad it's all in the first half only.As we know,in the opening, Sandy's cousin Michael Carrington has come to live in the U.S. and attend Rydell High in California like she did. In this case, he's a 'male' Sandy and Pink Lady and 'Stephanie Zinone' is the female 'Danny Zuko'. She of course thinks he's a nerd & uninteresting. He meet up with Frenchy (Didi Conn) as he gets off the school bus. It's not long before he's fallen for Stephanie, who's getting sick of the immaturity and bossiness of current T-Bird leader Johnny Nogerelli, who's only her boyfriend because she's a Pink Lady. Michael decides (despite Frenchy's Warning) to try and become a T-Bird type himself and win Stephanie's love & respect. In mere weeks (in movie time) he's practically Evel Knievel on a motorcycle, wearing a leather jacket and disguising his voice in a weird American voice. He single handedly takes on the T-Birds rival gang outside the bowling alley.Anyway, up to the point of the ""Prowlin'"" number, it's was a good movie. Then it all falls apart. Right after that is a somewhat dull scene in a diner with Michael & Stephanie. An even duller song by Caufield, the goofy fallout shelter scene and a bit later, the unbelievably embarrassing and badly staged 'Graduation Luau' .I have to say this, for being a young actress at the time, Pfeiffer's is the best actor of all in the whole film. .... but has no choice but to somehow get through the scene of her and Zmed in the boat in a round swimming pool.Johnny's actually trying to row his way out, when the rival gang shows up to wreck the place.... and her screaming ""Stop yelling at me!"" Another question...why ask Sid Cesar, Dody Goodman, Eve Arden to appear, when they really didn't give them much to do in the film? I feel their talents were wasted here. It's more like they're extras than real characters. Tab Hunter & Connie Stevens don't seem to add much to the mix either.The other problem here is, in the first half, the musical numbers are really good. Which gives the impression it's going to be a great movie.The opening number, ""Back To School Again"" (sung in a voice over by The Four Tops) is a great one. The dancing is perfect and the song's exciting.Other good numbers are Pfeiffer's ""Cool Rider"" (sort of 1980s Pat Benetar, being sung in 1961, with MTV like moves). Still, one of her best remembered moments in the film. ""Score Tonight"" (sung in the bowling alley) is more of a funny song than one to be taken seriously. Still, it works in how it's put together. ""Reproduction"", despite it's tacky lyrics, is also funny and it's routine works too.In the 2nd half of the film, only, "" Prowlin' "" - Sung by Adrian Zmed (depending on your opinion of his singing of course) and ""You're Girl For All Seasons"" are the best.The rest of the songs, ""Charades"" (sung by Caufield w/ too much echo effect), ""Who's That Guy?, ""Love Will Turn Back The Hands Of Time"", ""Do It For Our Country"", ""Rock-A-Hula Luau"" and ""We'll Be Together"" ....are anywhere from dull to just really uninspired songwriting.There's even the bad edit from Stephanie & Michael starting the ""We'll Be Together"" number, to everyone already coupled up (including them) and slow dancing/walking to the camera. Topped off with some silly 'spinning and/or 'ballet' routine. So, all of this,is why I'm rating it 5 stars. A good jump start in the first half but a 2nd half that gets lost and runs out of gas on the way to the finish line. (END)",Grease 2
33,TheHonestCritic,"The original ""Grease"" (1978) is the greatest musical film of all-time. But, the excuse for the existence of this ""film"" is.....?",4,10 June 2020,"""Grease 2"" (1982), the only reason for this ""movie"" to be made is all because the film makers saw dollar signs in front of their eyes and greed took over. Because of greed, we get crappy film, after crappy film, after crappy film! This is one of the most pointless sequels of all-time. It has a dumb and cliched story, overall terrible acting and a boring predictable soundtrack. The story, or lack thereof, is pretty much the same thing as in ""Grease"" (1978). I don't know about you, but I'm getting tired of that lazy cliched trope! The only difference is that most of the characters are different, but they just mirror the same plot line as the original. Film Making 101: if you're going to make a sequel, try to make the story it's own unique idea without looking back on the first story. You can have some references to the first film. But, if you're going to follow a similar plot line, then you better know what you're doing! Here's a little history about the making of this ""movie"". The original script was incomplete when they started filming. Whose bright idea was that? That totally goes against film protocol! You cannot start production of a movie unless the script is complete. Otherwise, your film will just be a jumbled mess! All this ""film"" does is recycle the original movie. Only without the energy and charm! As for the acting, it's overall disappointing from all of the actors and actresses. However, the only ones that seem to be trying are the actors and actresses from the first movie that are included in this ""film"". Yes, a few of the original cast members from the first movie were somehow bribed to take part in this atrocity. The cast members that returned are: Didi Conn as Frenchy, Eve Arden as Principal McGee, Sid Caesar as Coach Calhoun, Dody Goodman as Secretary Blanche Hodel, Eddie Deezen as Eugene Felsnick, Dennis C. Stewart as Leo Balmudo and Dick Patterson as Mr. Spears (who had actually appeared as Mr. Rudie in the previous film). Those cameos are the only performances that are worth watching. I don't know how they were talked into reprising their roles. Props to the casting agents! The sad thing is that this was Eve Arden's final theatrical role. What a terrible last movie for her to appear in. Such a crying shame, talk about going out on a low! Film Making 101: if you're going to make a sequel, make sure that the whole original cast is able to return. If they can't, just cancel the ""movie""! They didn't want to appear in this dumb ""film"" and I don't blame them! What they should have done was have the original cast in college. Then, this ""film"" would actually have some relevance for existing! Finally, the soundtrack is just boring and predictable. However, there is only one song in this ""movie"" that isn't that bad, honestly. The opening song, ""Back to School Again"", is actually a pretty catchy and well choreographed piece of music. Unfortunately, the rest of the music sucks. They started out promising, but then the ""film"" just takes a nose dive for the worst after that. They built me up, and then just kicked me in the nuts! Now for the positives, yes, there are a couple of positives in this ""film"". The sets/locations are nice and give a decent atmosphere. All of the special effects were well-done and still hold up today. Sadly, good sets/locations and special effects are no excuses for a bad story and horrible acting. ""Grease 2"" is a waste of a ""movie"" and it always will be. Thankfully, I'll never have to watch it again. I give this ""movie"" 2 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 stars. The first ""Grease"" movie is my all-time favorite musical film. ""Grease 2"" is an insult to the first movie! Just stick with the original film and try to forget that this sequel exists. I know I will! ""Grease"" is the word, not ""Grease 2""!",Grease 2

I need to fast forward in such as the classroom song Reproduction. Except that some really like that song. Personal taste? In comparison, Blue Crush 2 and Mean Girls 2 are more difficult for me.

Watching it is pretty much like ordering a hot dog and only getting the bun. There is nothing flavorful and fresh to offer, and it looks half-baked, as if they just did the whole film in two takes.""Grease 2"" holds no real resemblances to the first, except for the school. Characters you may have liked are all gone, instead replacing Danny Zuko (masterfully played by John Travolta) with the nerdy British exchange student Michael Carrington (Maxwell Caufield) - who only sang one song - and Sandy Olsson (also masterfully played by Olivia Newton-John) with the most popular girl in school, Stephanie Zinone (Michelle Pfeiffer) - it's a role reversal plot at its worst, and there's tons of bad suspense points cheesy dialogue, tie-ins to the early '60s (1961 to be exactly), it's all so bleak and bland that it looks like a bootleg ripoff. The stupid songs, on the other hand, sound like something that came out of a high school chorus rendering of a '50's doo wop medley.To sum it up, the whole thing was atrocious. ""Grease 2"" makes ""High School Musical: Senior Year"" look like an Oscar contender. That is how low this movie can go and a boring way to cash in more on the franchise nobody wanted a sequel for. Those who even say Pfeiffer's performance was a redeeming factor are wrong - a year later, Michelle would make up for ""Grease 2"" by playing in ""Scarface"" with Al Pacino, and her role in ""Scarface"" rocketed her career and put her on the map (I also assume that Ms. Pfeiffer regrets having accepted to act in ""Grease 2""). ""Grease 2"" is one of the all time worst...if you want to watch good movies with Ms. Pfeiffer, go watch ""Scarface"" instead. Oh no, this movie is very violent for you, since you only know her for her romantic comedies. Michelle Pfeiffer isn't Julia Roberts, Reese Witherspoon or Katherine Heigl, you know!",Grease 2

The cast and musical score is more than competent for it's genre and arena. Great, energetic, brilliant opening number. Maxwell Caulfield and Michelle Pfeiffer look drop dead beautiful as the two romantic leads. I do wish they were stronger singers. Also, more great cameos from old stars of yesteryear.

38,richspenc,"Noticeably inferior remake to original, but not really bad compared to horrible movies",5,8 September 2017,"The original Grease really is a classic, this is not. Here's my list of things that took the movie down some notches from the original:The unnecessary high levels of crudeness compared to the original, especially with that innaproprietly dirty song in the classroom ""Reproduction"". The original Grease may have dealt with a character who spent part of the movie thinking she may be pregnant and a car scene showing the implication of her having sex with her boyfriend and him suddenly exclaiming that his condom ripped. In Grease 2 though, we get a song where everyone is so happily and loudly singing such dirty lyrics which make up most of the song. There's also the suggestive songs ""We're gonna score tonight"" and ""Let's do it for our country"". Way more sexual implementations than the first film, and the Grease movies have supposed to have been semi family films with many fans of the first being youths.Next, the ham acting, like it seems like they're copying the first movie's attitudes and then exaggerating them in an overly goofy way. The way the T birds act in this film is a good example. Also, the way they treat new English student Michael, harrasing him even before finding out he fancies one of the T bird's crushes Stephanie (Michelle Phiefer). Then the overly stereo typical way the movie portrayed nerds. Just like in the ""Revenge of the nerds"" films, they make them talk in that shrill voice wearing those goofy glasses and pocket protectors. Hear the nerd's jokingly shrill voice near the beginning when asking Michael ""how long have you been in America?"", or where they trip him outside the bus during the opening number, or during ""Reproduction"" one nerdy guy says in a ridiculous sounding voice ""ohh, I think I'm gonna throw up"".The songs in this film break out without reason too much, where in the first film, there's a reason for each song. And there were more better songs in the first.Here are the few things in the movie I liked which kept me from giving the film a rating lower than 5:There were a few good songs. I kinda liked the girls with Stephanie singing ""A girl for all seasons"", a nice catchy tune, the T birds' song ""Prowling"", and the song ""Who's that guy?"" while Michael is kickin it up on the motorcycle. The rest of the songs were either sub par or inappropriate.Even though some reviewers don't agree, I kinda liked Phiefer as Stephanie. She was cute, and I always found Phiefer beautiful, even like 12 years later as teacher in ""Dangerous minds"". I know she had those clothes, those shades, and that bubble gum popping, but that was sorta early 1980s style. Michael was an alright character too, he played his role straight, and was only wanting people to like him. And he wanted to start riding motorcycles, nothing wrong with that.This movie had some good, and definitely had some bad.",Grease 2
39,boyinflares,"A better title might have been ""Greased""",7,3 October 2005,"Perhaps if Grease 2 didn't have to live up to the mighty original Grease, then it wouldn't be seen as such a terrible movie. Don't get me wrong, I loved the original Grease, but Grease 2 is not as bad as people make it out to be.The songs may not be as catchy as songs from the first film, but ones like ""Score Tonight"" and ""Reproduction"" were certainly fun. The vehicles, motorcycles in this film, do not play as much of an important part to the film as the cars did in the original either, which is neither good nor bad in my opinion.The cast are a mixed-bag too. Hottie Maxwell Caulfield is the greatest thing since sliced bread, but while I normally like Michelle Pfeiffer, she seemed terribly distracted in this film, like she wanted to be somewhere else. Adrian Zmed was good as the leader of the T-Birds, but the others, particularly the guy that played Goose, were annoying, as was Lorna Luft who played Paulette. Alison Price and Pamela Segall were great to watch, though they didn't get a lot of screen time. Didi Conn was rather wasted as Frenchy however, and Eve Arden and Dody Goodman both graciously returned as the school principal and her assistant, and both gave terrific performances.So when watching Grease 2, try not to think of the original Grease, and maybe you will like it a little bit more.",Grease 2

43,The-Last-Prydonian,People's enjoyment of it will depend on what they away from it no matter the varying reasons.,4,20 December 2017,"Set in 1961 Grease 2 picks up four years after where the first movie left off . it sees newcomer Michael Carrington, just recently arrived at Rydell as an exchange student from England falling for the beautiful Stephanie Zinone. However she show's no interest in him romantically as being the leader of the Pink Ladies, rules dictate that she and her friends can only date gang members of the T-Birds. Undeterred Michael formulates a plan to win her affections much to the ire of T-Bird leader Johnny Nogrelli.Given the the phenomenal commercial success and it's cult status it would have seemed inevitable that a sequel would be on the cards. Allan Carr, who was co-producer had made a deal with Paramount Pictures to be paid $5 million to produce a sequel within three years of it's predecessors theatrical release, and he delivered on that promise. Bringing in professional dance choreographer Patricia Birch, who had worked on the original's choreography to direct, she undoubtedly had a lot to live up to given it's reputation. An almost entirely new team of actors were cast, and the overall result although not completely utterly awful, still to this day leaves something to be desired.To it's credit the majority of the songs are of a catchy and dare I go so far as say being memorable with some energetic, well choreographed dance routines. It's certainly not boring and you get the distinct feeling that there is at least some attempt to do right by the fans by doing justice to what came before. However, the major flaw is with it's uneven script which relies a bit too much on toilet humour, some of which at the time wouldn't have been enough to justify it's PG certificate. That said there are some genuinely funny and inspired moments where I found myself laughing a bit more than I should have been. There are attempts as well to be larger than life, too larger than life in fact as are most of it's characters. The only members of the cast who seem at all restrained are it's two leads although Maxwell Caulfield with his smoldering goods looks which would no doubt have sent female cinema goers pulses racing is a poor substitute for John Travolta. He just lacks Travolta's charisma, and there's definitely something lacking in terms of chemistry between he and co-star Michelle Pfieffer, who incidentally comes off significantly better. Actually her's is one of the best performances of the movie with her portrayal of the gutsy Stephanie. Her high octane performance of the super fueled Cool Rider puts the Power in Girl Power long before the term had been invented, and you can see the early signs that she had what it took to be a star. Besides the lack of spark between them the plot involving Michael adopting a mysterious, masked biker alter ego in an attempt to woo the girl that he adores undermines the validity of any feelings that Stephanie has for him. Her ""love"" for him comes across as mere infatuation which is purely superficial. This is the girl who after all sang that she wants a Cool Rider with a motorcycle, ""No ordinary boy is gonna do. I want a rider that's cool"". It doesn't make her look good and she comes off as a immature young woman with a shallow schoolgirl crush. The flipping of the each side of the high school cliques that two lead protagonists come from, an obvious attempt to put a new spin on what made the first movie successful does little to alter the fact that this is still a retread over the same story, with an unconvincing main plot development thrown in. The overall quality of the acting from the new kids is decidedly patchy, with Adrian Zmed amusingly cocky without becoming overly obnoxious. Any reservations about them there may be, he manages to be likeable although indications may point to the contrary early on. Lorna Luft as the blonde bimbo Paulette pouts and overdoes the breathy voice in an attempt to channel Marilyn Monroe, but it merely grates although she does come in to her own more in later scene when she dials it down. And while it is great to see the returning cast members make an appearance, with the glorious Eve Arden reprising her role as school principal, Miss McGee, it's pretty unforgivable to see Didi Conn as frenchy largely wasted with little screen time she is given and with a contrived explanation as to her presence. In the end Grease 2 is something of an admirable failure which misses more than it hits but when it does hit it does with considerable impact. The kitch cheesiness of it however has meant that it has gained something of a minor cult status, perhaps by those who find it so bad to be good (although it's not even bad enough by my personal estimations to gain such dubious an honour) or those with lower expectations than others. It has made it's mark and whether you choose to embrace it or not, if you go for the former then I suppose it doesn't matter why it is if you can find something to enjoy.",Grease 2
44,rstef1,"Why God, Why???",2,8 June 2003,"Mention Grease and peoples' faces light up. That movie brought happiness to viewers and fame to its cast. Mention Grease 2 and a darkness falls across the face of the listener. This movie didn't bring joy to anyone and almost brought the career of a young Michelle Pfeiffer to a halt.Grease 2 is one of the worst, not to mention most unnecessary, sequels ever made. Sure, you could argue Jaws 2, Halloween 2, any Friday the 13'th sequel, Godfather 3, and, perhaps, Matrix Reloaded sucked. But at least those films had some redeeming features. Not so here.Take two young actors (Pfeiffer & Caulfield) not known for their singing, and give them some crappy songs to perform. Toss in uninspired dances and staging, a ridiculous script and a cheesy look to the film and then sit back and watch the fun!Most of the original cast was smart enough to bail out on this turkey; while those who returned look uncomfortable about being there, with good reason. Did Didi Conn really need a paycheck that bad? And, of course, it's laboring under the immense shadow of the original. It never stood a chance. I'm giving it 2 stars only because of Michelle Pfeiffer's presence. To be avoided like the plague.",Grease 2
45,Colbridge,I came away from Grease 2 not being able to hum one song from the entire movie and for a musical that is not a good sign,4,10 June 2021,"I do like to review each film on it's own merit whether it is a sequel, part of a franchise or remake rather than just comparing it to the original, but in the case of Grease 2 it's complicated seeing how the original Grease is so beloved, a perfect confection of a movie and is firmly in my top 5 films of all time. That is probably why I couldn't face watching Grease 2 after all the flack it had received in the intervening years and, before you know it, almost 40 years have passed but at least now I can come at it with fresh eyes and be more objective.I was ready to really enjoy this film, clear my mind of all negativity and hope it would recapture all the energy and exuberance of the first film. It tries, it really tries, but it tries so hard it sorely misses the mark on every level. Broadly speaking original choreographer turned director Patricia Birch falls into all the cliched traps that Randal Kleiser was able to avoid the first time around.The problem starts with the whole role reversal idea where fiesty Michelle Pfeiffer is the one wooing shy Aussie Maxwell Caulfield. It probably looked great on paper but in reality, especially set in 1961, it never rings true. Pfeiffer does her best in her first big starring role but Caulfield is woefully miscast and lacks the charisma needed. The other major problem are the songs. Grease was always a stand alone musical which ran on broadway for years before it made it to the big screen. I came away from Grease 2 not being able to hum one song from the entire movie, and for a musical that is not a good sign. The musical numbers seemed forced at times rather than being organic to the story. It's almost like they came up with the songs first and built a script around it.To be fair to Birch the staging of the dance sequences are great and that is what she is good at but that is all we have here. Everything looks familar but, like starting a new school year, it is also unfamiliar. The approach here was to try to make it more contemporary with a ramping up of sexual innuendo and risque songs but this is it's major downfall. Audiences loved the charm and innocence of the original, Grease 2 denies us of that and tries to be more sassy but it falls flat.A few of the original supporting cast members make a welcome return like Didi Conn, Sid Caesar and Eddie Deezen but have little effect on the overall outcome of falling well short of the original, not being able to carve out an identity of it's own and ultimately disappointing audiences.",Grease 2
46,parhat,In a Musical the Music Writer is Everything,2,24 January 2008,"The single greatest pains I have suffered in my life of watching movies has been watching Grease 2. It pains me deeply to watch a poorly cast main actor, whose name is so forgettable, unlike John Travolta, and a memorable Michelle Pfieffer whose role is doesn't even hold water - the chewing gum girl. However the single greatest mistake in this movie is the Producer's decision to forget the importance that in a musical, musical writers are the ticket to a great movie. The second mistake they made was to change the director from Randal Kleiser to a Patricia Birch. The formula of successes for Robert Stigwood in Saturday Night Live was the Bee Gees, and for Grease 1, it was John Farrar, Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey. However, it was John Farrar's music that stole the show for Grease 1. In Grease 2 the only great music that comes from the entire sad movie was Reproduction, which turns out to be a comedy than a real musical. Assuming the relative interesting music, I believe just only one to be unique for Grease 2, while for Grease 1, you got ""Hopelessly Devoted to You"", ""Summer Nights"", ""Grease"", ""You're the One that I want"", and ""Grease Lightning"". Grease 1 had 5 great hits, while only one not so great ""Reproduction"", from then on the value of musical is not even any interesting. With poor scripts, bad casting, and a forgotten talented music writers, the movie is painful for me to watch. Way back in the 1950s, they proudly promoted their musical writers, such as Rodgers and Hammerstein, and the hits were consistent with the talent of the musical writer, such as Oklahoma!, King and I, The Sound of Music, South Pacific, and then some. Then we have the enduring Henry Mancini, Breakfast at Tiffany's, Pink Panther, and other memorable movies just by the weight of the musicians. The producers such as Robert Stigwood basically got lucky, but didn't learn from any of their success, which I think was fluke, despite bad scripts from Saturday Night Fever, but didn't seem to learn from their success, and seems to go downhill. So in case I am wondering why Grease 2 failed, it failed in most every aspect that it is still a pain to watch that forgettable what's his face, British Actor, and somewhat uninteresting Michelle Pfieffer miscast and the lack of any chemistry between the two. Still it can be salvaged and become a hit, if the producers simply didn't toss away John Farrar, Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey like feminine napkins. If anyone thinks Grease 2 was poorly budgeted, its budget was 13,000,000 compared to Grease 1 where its budget is halved that at 6,000,000. So it is likely that they didn't care about the quality of music in a musical. If you want to watch a good musical, I think Grease 1, Chicago, Hairspay, Saturday Night Fever and Sound of Music would be it. But if you just wanted to see the movie without the need for any music and a Michelle Pfieffer fans, or what's his face main actor, then Grease 2 is better. All in all, I would like to give a 1, but decided to give 2 out of 10 for this because the title Grease 2 is a good one, other than that, there is no redeeming likeness Grease 1 other than the fact that it was done by the same Producers, who short-sightedness barely made any money from this mistake.",Grease 2
47,Blooeyz2001,Nothing Works In This Drawn Out Dud!,1,2 October 2004,"What worked in ""Grease"" falls flat in ""Grease 2"". Aside from the fact that all interest in this concept had virtually depleted in the four years since ""Grease"", there's nothing here that could resurrect it for an audience. All the fun, & magic of ""Grease"" is missing. Uncharismatic actors do not help the situation one bit. They tried hard but failed miserably! Adrian Zmed is no John Travolta & you can't help but think that every time the schlub is on screen. Michelle Pfeiffer is beautiful & at least they had the good sense to pair her up with Maxwell Caulfield, who's just as pretty. Yet he's a wet noodle with zero personality & no screen presence whatsoever, despite his good looks. Poor Didi Conn gets thrown into this madness for familiarity, then is tossed aside & forgotten about. This movie is not a pleasant experience. The motorcycle-heaven hallucination sequence that Pfeiffer falls into during her ""Girl For All Seasons"" number is murky & disturbing. They were going for an exciting ""Beauty School Dropout"" number & ended up with a big, hot mess. There's also one too many endings & the lame finale leaves a bad taste in your mouth with that unclimatic, ho-hum, wishy-washy, watered down ""We Go Together"" wannabe ""song"". Lorna Luft gives her all but a Marilyn Monroe sex symbol type she ain't. The dancing is clumsy, & the songs are quickly forgotten.

53,phantopp,Lacks the magic of the original,3,26 April 2009,"In 1961, two years after ""Sandy"", ""Danny"" and the gang from Rydell High School graduated and went on with their lives, we return to the school on the first day of the school year with a new group of students, along with some familiar faces.""Michael"" (Maxwell Caulfield), the British cousin of ""Sandy"", arrives on the first day as students are dancing and singing. He is met by ""Frenchy"" (Didi Conn), the ""Beauty School Dropout"" who is returning to start her career in cosmetology by learning high school chemistry.Soon after arriving, he bumps into the beautiful ""Stephanie"" (Michelle Pfeiffer, in her first starring role), who is the leader of the girls gang the ""Pink Ladies,"" and the latest girl of ""Johnny"" (Adrian Zmed), the leader of the ""T-Birds"", a gang once lead by ""Danny"" in the original movie.It is love at first sight for the well-mannered young man, but he quickly learns that he has to be a ""T-Bird"" to date her. But, he will do anything to get close to her.Now, ""Michael"" pursues his crush by turning into what ""Stephanie"" wants -- a ""cool rider"" who will sweep her off her feet.Let me say right off the bat, this is a very weak followup to one of the greatest musicals of all time. It just completely lacks the magic of the original film.First of all, there is the music. If you ask me, only two of the 13 songs are memorable. The rest, though having the sound of early-60's music, is just terrible and uninspired. To me, most of the tunes sounded as if they were just thrown together just before production starts. As for the choreography in these scenes, it's hit or miss. In the original, we get an energetic dance number in the school gym, which is one of the most memorable moments in the movie. In Grease 2, we get an out-of-nowhere number in the local bowling alley that the cast appeared to enjoy doing. However, I would not want to go back to learn these steps (and I am in a wheelchair). I also felt, with some exceptions, that the cast was taught the choreography the day before filming the dance scenes.One of the biggest problems is character development. To me, the characters seemed to have been written as if we are expected to know the new faces. Most of the main characters appear to be loosely based on specific characters from the first film (most notably ""Michael,"" a male version of ""Sandy"" with a bit of ""Danny"" thrown in, and ""Stephanie"", a female version of ""Danny"" with a bit of ""Sandy"" thrown in). There are also many supporting characters with their own, minor story lines which barely moves the story along. We get only minor basics of these characters, and the audience mostly ignores them due to not being presented well.As for performances from the main cast, they are fairly good, but not perfect. Pfeiffer is near perfect in her first major role on the silver screen, and carries the weaker members of the cast fairly well in their scenes together -- and she can actually carry a tune pretty well (especially in ""Cool Rider,"" one of the only two songs you will most likely remember after the closing credits end. Caulfield was pretty good as ""Michael"", even in his invented alter-ego to swoon ""Stephanie"". However, there was something lacking in their romantic chemistry most of the time.The supporting cast, all around, is quite weak. Like I said, these characters are horribly written. We only get the most basic information. The ""T-Birds"" lacked the feel of being a unit, as did the ""Pink Ladies."" We even get some of the original cast in this film, but they are only on-screen to deliver a line or two as the movie progresses.As for the wardrobes, nothing real special here. The gym shirts the men wear in one scene appear to have the school name ironed onto it, and not in a quality a school district would spend the money on. I found the wardrobe pretty boring actually. The ""Pink Ladies"" and ""T-Birds"" iconic jackets don't look that great on the cast members wearing them. And, especially with certain male members of the cast, the hairdos look too much teased. It looked as if they cut some corners on the wardrobes and hairdos to me.The story just feels rushed, especially the part where ""Michael"" creates his alter-ego. It appears that he became an expert in riding rather quickly, as there was no way to tell how much time had past.I really can't recommend this one. If you already own the first movie, I would suggest that you get this film just so you can have both movies. And that's the only reason to purchase it. It's just not able to live up to the icon that is the original.",Grease 2

55,jennifer_litchfield,Star rating: 2 out of 5,3,22 February 2003,"Grease 2 is yet another sequel that completely fails to live up to its predecessor.  Whereas 1978's Grease was fun and energetic, the word that springs to mind in association with Grease 2 is ""forced"".  The director has tried to fit too much colour, too many plot elements, and too many (largely unfunny) humorous interludes into 115 minutes of film.  These teenagers aren't just a little bit naughty and likeably rude, rather they are all-out hussies and juvenile delinquents.The plot is a carbon copy of the original film.  A foreign student enrolls at Rydell High, immediately develops a crush on the leader of the school's socially elite clique, and spends the rest of the movie trying to make themselves cool enough to be dateable material.  One of the movie's few successes is the casting of Michelle Pfeiffer as the head of the Pink Ladies.  She is both real and charismatic.  Unfortunately the same can't be said of her opposite, Michael (Maxwell Caulfield), who never really gets into the feel of the film.  Additionally, his voice is too light for his character, and at times he appears to have difficulty holding a tune. 
Song-wise the best of the bunch are the first and last tracks (Back To School Again and We'll Be Together).  They are catchy and snappily choreographed chorus numbers, worthy of inclusion in the Grease franchise. The rest of the soundtrack wavers between mediocre, appallingly sentimental and plain ridiculous.  Whoever decided that a neat scenario for a song would be to have a biology class singing about the pollination of plants (with the mandatory sexual undertones of course) should have been fired on the spot.

I love it when guys kiss like that.OK, IMDb forces me to write 10 lines, so this is going to get really cheesy because it's all going to be about Maxwell Caulfield. First of all, he did a great job, quietly emoting throughout the whole movie. I mean, he had a shallow script to work with, but he made it heartfelt. Without wincing or puckering or sighing or vogueing, his deadpan face screamed heartache. Ouch! And Michelle Pfeiffer was good, too, for a start up.Yeah, back to Caulfield...so where the heck did he end up? He did TV shows for years.

57,akoaytao1234,The hotter and youthful version of Grease,6,2 October 2021,"This film clearly took notes of the criticism of the original. The film does not make you wonder of the age of the cast. A lot of them are more youthful looking or they at least does not feel like as old as a your parents. They also made the film's Sandy (played by Pfeiffer) more intuitive and generally less emotive.But that's pretty much were the success of the film ends.Sadly the film fails in one aspect that really made the original successful, the music.Leaving the music behind, the original is not really a noteworthy film, in hindsight. Grease's story is just enough fluff and edge but it is not something to write about. But original's musical core really pushes it into another territory.In Grease 2, the story pretty much drives the film. Its kind of awkward actually seeing some of the music, because it feels unprompted (ie the Cool Rider scene) and sometimes too out of the blue. It's a distraction. In addition, the music is too wordy for its own good. None of the song registered compared to the original, which I also barely knew before watching but does remember at least five by the end.Overall, the film is okay but more so as an appreciation of the story unlike the original, which is an appreciation for the songs.[3/5]PS: The film has a weird obsession with the male lead played by Caulfield. There is a lot of ""glamor"" shots of him inserted for reaction shots. I know that he is REALLY HOT and I guess, the studio was banking for him as the next big star but really movie?",Grease 2

None of the performers have any chemistry with one another, and only Michelle Pfeiffer can hold the audiences attention. There are some pleasing moments however, the song reproduction is fun and could rival some of originals songs, and the T birds prowling song is fun (though doesn't rival Grease lightning). Really this film isn't all that much worse than the original, it just isn't quite as engaging and happy.

59,JelenaG890,This deserves its reputation,1,28 September 2017,"Okay, so was the original Grease the greatest movie of all time? Of course not. But at least it was fun, had catchy songs, and a good cast.Grease 2 has none of the above. The problems with this movie, as well as why it bombed so badly are as follows, in my opinion.1. This movie had no star power. the original ""Grease"" had John Travolta, who had just come off doing ""Saturday Night Fever"" and had been on ""Welcome Back Kotter."" It also had Olivia Newton-John, at the time one of the biggest recording artists in the world. Jeff Conaway was on ""Taxi"" and had been on Broadway. Stockard Channing was also known for film and TV. Who did ""Grease 2"" have? Maxwell Caufield, who was unknown, and Michelle Pfeiffer, also unknown at the time.2. The story line and characters. The ""Grease"" sequel had a bad girl and good boy meeting and going against the high school social hierarchy, opposite of the first film. That would have been fine, if both of the characters had been willing to change for each other, as Danny and Sandy both were. But they weren't, and none of this movie made much sense. Why did they start prepping for an end of the year talent show on the first day of school? On top of a poor story line, not one of the characters were even likable. If you have unknown actors in a film, you need a story line, or something, to attract them.3.The songs. The original ""Grease"" film had songs that are still played on the radio today. This film has classics (haha) like ""Reproduction"" and ""Cool Rider."" Yeah, I never hear those songs on the radio these days.4. The direction. They hired a former choreographer to direct this film instead of someone with actual experience directing a film.There are some movies that are so good they're bad.

I dislike both movies, and was reluctant to see the musical but when my cousin took me to see a recent revival for my birthday I truly appreciated the experience. And in that, I had more respect for the first Grease movie, which stared John Travolta (pre Saturday Night Fever) and Olivia Newton-John (Post ""Have you never been mellow?"") It was a good career jump-start for both of them, and aside form incorporating cheesy disco numbers into the soundtrack, it stayed relatively the same as the musical. And, it was a huge success.Not so for Grease 2. Whose great idea was this?Let's make the guy a shy, prissy wallflower and make the girl a gang member? Normally, I'd be all for the gender-swapping, but the way they went about it was horrible. The supporting cast--everyone from the T-bird leader (adrian zmed) to the blonde bombshell (Lorna Luft) was just off. Lorna, well being a member of a talented family, never got to prove herself playing such an out of place Marilyn Monroe Wannabe. And casting another disco king as another greaser did not give Zmed the same success as Travolta. Because face it, acting just isn't Zmed's thing. the rest of the T-birds are annoying. The Pink Ladies all tried to be carbon copies of the original characters, with horrifying results. The music is dreadful. I'm hearing a critique of every number by Simon Cowell in my head, as I think of it. The bomb shelter scene had no point...except for sexual innuendo hidden in a stupid song. The reproduction class had no point...except for sexual innuendo hidden in an even stupider song. Remember the cool dance scene? Well we got a bowling alley and some lame motorcycle stunts. Lucky us! What could have been the one bright spot in this black whole of silliness was the cameo appearance of Didi Con as Frenchie! But it's obvious that Didi is far too old at this point to play a high school student, and you wonder exactly how many years this ""beauty school drop out"" had to repeat her senior year at Rydell High. People actually walked out of the theater during it's short run. My friend and I stayed only because she thought Adrian Zmed was hot. I felt sorry for her, and even sorrier for me that I had to sit through it without even being amazed by the looks of Caulfield or any of the other male actors.

The overtly sexual girl (Played by Lorna Luft, the OTHER daughter of Movie icon Judy Garland) is viewed kindly and it shows the period well.

I love the music in this movie musical. Although not quite sounding like the late 50's to early 60's, it is addictive.

I can't stand watching movies I loathe, much less writing about them. Grease 2 is the exception. No one should have to view that blind, although people who are actually blind have a big advantage over those unfortunate enough to have all five senses when it comes sitting through Grease 2 I didn't see this impersonation of a movie for twenty-seven years after its release... and I could have waited a lifetime longer. You know how they say it's so bad, it's good? Well, this is so terrible, it's really, really terrible. And I wouldn't do it justice if I stopped there. It's awful, dreadful, rotten, hideous,abominable, grotesque, horrific, atrocious, deplorable, revolting, abhorrent, ghastly, grim, not all that good, and even rather unpleasant! Not only that, it stinks. And I don't mean that figuratively, you can actually smell it! Usually a movie has some redeeming value. The only redeeming value in Grease 2 is that it ends.At least I hope it does - I didn't wait around to find out! If Grease 2 doesn't make the case for adding negative numbers to the rating system, I don't know what does?!?",Grease 2
67,Brian-97,A fun movie.,4,8 December 1998,"I love ""Grease 2""!  I don't love it as much as the original but it is great just the same.  Michelle Pfeiffer is great as is Adrian Zmed as Johnny.  The other cast members from the original such as Didi Conn(Frenchy), Eve Arden(Principal McGee), and Dody Goodman(Blanche) are a welcome addition. The songs in this sequel are catchy and fun!  The theme is light and the overall effect is good.  I love this movie!",Grease 2
68,sundog1,CAMP CLASSIC,10,23 June 2003,"""Grease 2"" is the ugly stepchild of ""Grease."" Which makes is all the more fun, kitschy & loveable.Songs are pretty good. Fun to see Pfeiffer at the beginning of her career, and Caulfield plays a great ""closet leather guy"" (lol-- you can have a field day with the homoerotic subtext-- what ARE those T-Birds paying Michael for anyway?!)The original ""Grease"" has become a bit of a cliche, but the sequel is trashy unpretentious fun, and has enough spark & originality to stand on its own merit.DVD transfer is quite good, finally in its 2.35:1 aspect ratio, and a nice 5.1 remastering, but no extras.As ""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls"" was to ""Valley of the Dolls,"" so goes the same for ""Grease 2."" Perfect midnight movie. Ignore those uptight people who diss it. Yes, it is BAD, but that's the joy of it.The only reason to dislike it is because everyone says you're supposed to. Think free-- have fun!",Grease 2
69,chitara-69170,Don't Bother,1,9 September 2020,"Absolute garbage. The songs are forgettable, the singing mediocre, the dancing would shame a church hall production.The message of this film is if you are a nice boy from the suburbs, you will be despised, mocked, and everybody will enjoy your torment. If you are a hard man who joins a gang and gets into fights, you are a hero, universally admired, and you get to date the hottest girls. How is that supposed to be a ""positive message""?Stick to the original, with its tongue in cheek charm. Don't bother with this nasty tongue in mouth sequel.",Grease 2
70,cristos21,Terrible casting other than Michele.,7,2 September 2020,"The casting was pretty bad. Adrian was a horrible Zucko. They made him a coward. The tbirds were cool. The nerds could of beat up these tbirds. Of course, Michele held the whole movie. The singing was incredible from her. The only other one I like was Liza's Minnelli's daughter. Great singer but acting not too good. Plot horrible. But whenever it's on I always watch it. Don't know why.",Grease 2
71,marino_touchdowns,"A fun, near death experience for the whole family.",4,27 April 2006,"I love this movie! In fact it went so far that my sister even bought me the soundtrack. But that doesn't mean I'm stupid. This movie is a train wreck that is truly embarrassing. Adrian Zmed is to good at acting to be reduced down to this filth. After seeing this movie I really want to know how on earth Michelle Phieffer ever became a star. She has a singing voice that reminds me of hitting a cookie sheet with a hammer. Her family should be humiliated by this movie. There is one classically funny part though. When Louis DiMucci(Peter Frechette) tricks his girlfriend into almost sleeping with him because the Russians are attacking. The end of the scene doesn't make any sense though, so that reminds you that the movie is bad. If you are looking for a good date movie, stick to the original. This movie just gives us another reason to hate sequels.",Grease 2
72,Lozbee2000,Great film!,7,13 August 2002,"This film to me is not that bad, most the people who have seen it compare it to the original. What I reckon is that if this was just a film and not a sequel to Grease it would probably be appreciated more.In my opinion I like Grease 2 better, I actually found Grease to be quite boring, but hey that's just me. In Grease 2 I like the songs better and the guys are much more better looking than the first one.Overall this movie for me is quite entertaining and I like it, and I certainly do not compare it to the first one as it is a whole new different movie and storyline.So if you haven't seen Grease 2 before because people say it's crap and that it's a waste of time, at least give it a chance and watch it, it might surprise you.",Grease 2
73,Ragnarok-5,Everything in this movie is a downgrade,1,5 May 2019,"Michelle Pfeiffer is a downgrade from Olivia Newton-John.
Maxwell Caulfield and Adrian Zmed were a downgrade from John Travolta.
The music is a downgrade from Grease.
The story is a downgrade from Grease.
The motorcycles are a downgrade from those sweet cars they were driving around in.
Frenchy is barely in it.
The lyrics ""Let's bowl. Let's bowl. Let's rock and roll."" was a horrible. How can anybody equate bowling as cool?",Grease 2
74,coastin_on_a_dream,Second-rate rehash,4,5 July 2006,"""Grease 2"" isn't a sequel to ""Grease"", but rather a less-than-stellar rehash set two years later with different characters.Michael Carrington (played by Maxwell Caulfield, who has struggled in his big screen career since this bullet) is new to Rydell, transferring from England (one of the only ways this movie is related to the first film is that he's Sandy's cousin). Within the first week of school, he's fallen for the head of the Pink Ladies, Stephanie Zinone (played by then newbie, Michelle Pfeiffer. Wow, I guess when they say you have to start from the bottom and work your way up, they really meant it, eh Michelle?) But Stephanie isn't looking for a nerd like Michael, she's looking for a cool rider! One that rides motorcycles in skin tight leather! So basically, the movie is a simple gender-switch of the first movie, following Michael's quest to change his image and win over Stephanie.One thing that is disappointing is that this movie had so much potential, but never lived up to it. They could have given us a bit of history about the T-Birds and Pink Ladies. But do we get it? No. They could have given us some exciting new types of music that could have made this installment just as good as the last. Did we get it? No. There are plot holes throughout, and lacks a lot of originality. Did we need another mushy love story? No, we already saw that in the first movie. The original stars didn't come back, so I think the last thing they should have done was repeat the story! They could have shown us how one becomes a member of the T-Birds or The Pink Ladies, other than looking hot. But did they tell us? No. Their was just suddenly a new batch of Pink Ladies and T-Birds, and I suppose there's a new batch every year, but leave it to ""Grease 2"" to never explain it to us.How are the new T-Birds and Pink Ladies selected? We'll never know now. This movie had so much potential, could have had new clothes, new music, new everything, but no. We basically get a gender switch of the original ""Grease"", with the same music, same clothes, just different people, proving the producers and director were lazy and just looking for money, like they threw this whole movie together in 6 months.The acting is nothing great. The only people who shine in this movie are Adrian Zmed as the corky Johnny Nogorelli, Michelle Pfeiffer (who would obviously go on to do bigger and better things), and the famous Lorna Luft (Judy Garland's daughter), who plays Johnny's desperate stalker. However, leading man Maxwell Caulfield looks like he's trying to hard and comes off as annoying, unlike Olivia Newton-John was in the original version. Even Adrian Zmed looks like he's trying to copy John Travolta, but fails. As for the other T-Birds and Pink Ladies, they weren't memorable at all.The characters themselves aren't that great. They aren't very likable, and act like they just got out of juvee. The script is definitely lacking, and much of the dialogue is pretty bad and annoying.The songs? Well, some of them are somewhat catchy, but for the most part, fail at keeping your attention. The singing is also extremely;y second rate as well. Maxwell Caulfield sounds like he's struggling to hold a tune (wow how the hell did this kid get cast in this movie?!?) and the more professional singers such as Lorna Luft maybe get one solo throughout the movie, which brings me to another huge mistake in the movie. Who the hell decided to cast a bunch of unknowns in a big movie musical?!? And in a sequel to the highest grossing movies musical of all time?!? Bad move, very bad move.The film opens with ""Back To School Again"", which is the best song on the soundtrack, mainly because none of the kids from the cast sing it. 15 minutes later, the gang bursts into a song about bowling called ""Score Tonight"", which I guess was meant to be a big dance number/group ensemble, like ""Summer Nights"" was in the original. The song is catchy, except how does bowling relate to the movie's plot? It was a pointless song, and it was obviously just thrown into the movie for the sake of it. Were the filmmakers that lazy? Then Michelle Pfeiffer bursts into a song called ""Cool Rider"". It's a good song, actually, except the dance she does is pretty goofy and distracting in a bad way. Also, the song doesn't sound very 60s, it screams 1982. Time warp, anyone? Then there's a song about ""Reproduction"". See what I said about ""Score Tonight"". Same thing applies here. And then there's a string of unmemorable songs in the movie as well.The movie lacks the magic the original movie had. It has no energy, and in the original the songs just exploded into your face, but in ""Grease 2"", it doesn't lift off the screen. The characters aren't likable for the most part and it doesn't have any energy, motivation, and most of all, it doesn't have any effort. This movie claims to take place in 1961 when most of it screams 1982. Everyone who made this movie seemed to just be looking for money and not even caring about the movie itself. Hence, the laziness. I'm glad this movie flopped at the box office, because it proves you can't make it in Hollywood if you're lazy. So why did I give it a 4 out of 10? Because, even amidst all of it's terribleness, there are a few (and when I mean ""few"", I mean ""few"") good songs, a few exceptional performances (Adrian, Lorna, and Michelle), and there's a little bit of chemistry between the two leads, Michelle and Michael, most noticeable in the diner scene. Skip this turkey, only for the die-hard ""Grease"" fans.",Grease 2
75,emeraldreprobates,The original High School Musical 2,2,24 June 2015,"This is a spectacularly bad sequel to the John Travolta and Olivia Newton John 1978 hit, stars Michelle Pfeiffer and a bunch of other people including that guy from TJ Hooker and the women from Louie.It looks as if the people who made this looked at the original and decided to remove everything that worked and replace it with songs that weren't even good enough for the cutting room floor of Grease and acting not good enough for a day time soap opera.If you are looking for a film with a bunch of men and women in their late 20's maybe early 30's pretending to be high school kids singing bad, bad songs then this is the film for you but if you are looking for s film you might enjoy watching then this is not the film for you.Featured on Episode 59 of The Emerald Reprobates Podcast",Grease 2

The songs are memorable, and the characters are cool :-) BTW what happened to Zmed???? Grease 2 will take you back to school. Anyone who was in high school before technology ruled the world will smile while watching.",Grease 2
77,DennisJOBrien,Not really that bad a sequel,5,17 September 2005,"If this movie seems corny, remember it was deliberately designed to be that way .... this is an example of Hollywood's dumbing down of our collective memories of the 1950's and 1960's. At times the film does not look like it is set in the early 1960's, and some of the musical numbers seem to be more in keeping with the 1980's. However, the Hawaiian luau sequence was perfect for the silly innocence of the times before President Kennedy was assassinated.I thought Michelle Pfeiffer and Maxwell Caulfield were both attractive leads, even if their singing and dancing abilities are limited. As I never was too keen on the original Grease, that is why I was not very disappointed with Grease 2, as many apparently are.",Grease 2
78,Mis_Behavin,Dear God..... Is this what it's come to?!?!?!,3,20 July 2006,"Despite a brave attempt by Michelle Pfieffer to look as though she isn't hideously embarrassed to be involved with this lame film, her efforts are wasted as the only lesson to be learned from Grease 2 is that you definitely can't polish a turd.The combination of the appallingly farcical scripts and quite possibly some of the most annoying characters to EVER grace the big screen (step forward Adrian 'Johnny Nogerelli' Zmed) Grease 2 falls on its ass and then some...I actually can't believe someone signed on the dotted line to finance this pile of crap. The songs are cheesy (the real low point being 'Cool Rider'), the acting is diabolical (as stated, Pfieffer looks embarrassed to be on the screen) and the plot line is, at best, weak. Maxwell Caulfield does a reasonable job and, in my opinion, pulls off his role as the stiff English student, but the rest of them (except Didi Conn who is shamefully under-used) - forget it.The writers and actors in Grease 2 had huge shoes to fill, as Grease is a classic, however where Grease had a really cute charm to it, Grease 2 just stinks of money grabbing producers cashing in on the name. There is nothing likable about it and whereas the T-Birds and Pink Ladies were cool and funny in the original, in this vile production they are just horrible, nasty and obnoxious.I've given this a 3 purely on the basis that I think Pfieffer should be given some credit for pulling back her career after starring in this car-crash.",Grease 2
79,Cloud-6,Grease is not the word here.,1,7 May 1999,"OH god this is a really horrible movie. Compared to it's predecessor which by the way I gave a 10. This movie is a 1. The songs were pathetic, most likely written by a 7th grade girl with some help MAYBE from a couple of 8th grade boys. in the dictionary, under the word ""Hokey"", this movie is listed in the definition. Why don't they spoof this on MST3K, it certainly deserves it!!!",Grease 2
80,Cress,We're going back to Rydell....Again?,7,2 December 1998,"Ok, kill me now.... I LOVE Grease 2 Not as much as the orginal mind you, but hey this nearly could have been as good. Here we have Michelle Pfeiffer in one of her very early roles, but still quite good. We are once again back at Rydell with a new ensemble of T-Birds and Pink Ladies. Miss McKee, Frenchie, Blanche, and Coach Calhoun are still regular fixtures but everything else is new. Like Grease we have an outsider, sadly for us Brits a very stereotypical English guy who is surprise surprise Sandy's cousin. What follows is him trying to get one of the untouchable 'Unless you are a T-Bird' Pink Lady. What follows is a whiole group of songs just as good as the first bunch, namely 'Reproduction' and 'Let's Do It For Our Country' and the guy trying to get the girl. Does he succeed? You'll have to find out. Don't be put off that its a sequel. Give it a try you might just like it",Grease 2
81,ML368,"So much fun, and so underrated",10,1 January 2001,"I just loved this movie as a kid.  I saw it over and over on cable.  I was disappointed that the movie flopped.  I think part of the reason it wasn't successful was because people loved the original so much, felt nothing could compare, and didn't give it a chance. Personally, I liked it better than the original.  Yes, it's silly and a little farfetched, but it's not trying to be Shakespeare.  As a musical/comedy, it succeeds on every level.  The music is just terrific.  The song ""Cool Rider"" is so catchy and ""Reproduction"" is hilarious.  They are my favorite numbers. The story is sweet and charming. The characters are funny, likeable, and Michelle Pfeiffer, especially, gives a terrific performance. She had such star quality in this film; I have been a fan of hers ever since. I liked how several characters from the original were used and it was also a great idea to include actors from that era such as Tab Hunter and Connie Stevens. This movie is a guilty pleasure for some, and I have a feeling that there are more than a few people out there who can sing from memory every song on the sound track!",Grease 2
82,hs407,Awesome!!!,10,27 January 1999,"Granted, the original was excellent and may have had more substance, but this one is much funnier.  I loved it in 1982 when I was 9 and I still love it today.  Michelle Pfeiffer was excellent and this movie made me a fan of hers.  I highly recommend this movie if you love to laugh or are a fan of Michelle Pfeiffer's.",Grease 2
83,KirstenJackson,"Not A Good Movie, Terrible Actually",3,26 April 2005,"You know how some movies don't need a sequel because they were great as they are? Well, Grease did not need this boring, horrendous sequel! It is supposed to take place in 1961, two years after the T-Birds like Danny Zuko and Pink Ladies like Rizzo had left the high school. Now new student Michael Carrington has a crush on Pink Lady Stephanie Zinone and she can't go out with him because there is a code, Pink Ladies only date T-Birds and T-Birds only date Pink Ladies. So Michael tries hard to show off for her so he can win her over. Why was it such a bad movie? Well, it was too long, the storyline quickly got old and the songs were awful! the songs in Grease were good, catchy, stylish songs but these songs were stupid! To name a few were ""Reproduction'' and ""Score Tonight''. Ugh. Don't' bother renting this flop of a sequel.",Grease 2
84,blue_wave_aqua,Patricia Birch is the one who has the 'Rep to Protect',3,1 October 2006,"To be honest, I didn't like the first grease. At all. The people looked scary. The only good part was that 1 or 2 of the songs were catchy. In this version, the people look better.The thing that is bad about this movie is that the acting was terrible. Especially to part where Stephanie is on stage and tunes out into a type of heaven with 'biker-guy' aka Michael. All the songs were absolutely cheesy. The worst were 'Who's Thay Guy?', 'Reproduction', 'Let's do it For Our Country' and even 'Cool Rider'. But Michelle Pfieffer saved 'Cool Rider'.I think this movie shows how desperate guys can be to get the girl of their dreams. I was amazed to see how low Michael would go for Stephanie.Pat Birch should stick to Dance Choreography and only choreography. No directing. Just choreography. She should have let the original director do this movie even if she had to force them. What was she thinking putting Frenchie back and almost putting Kenickie in the movie? Frenchie in Grease 2 was a pathetic attempt to save the movie. I don't know about everyone else, but it's a very good thing that they didn't do 2 more movies and a TV show. What would the TV show have? Singing in every episode? This movie is just as bad as From Justin to Kelly, but what saved the movie was Michelle Pfiffer's 'Cool Rider' song and dancing, and that most people think Michael is 'Hot'.If I was bored out of my mind, I'd consider going back to watch this movie. But for now, I am sticking with Napoleon Dynamite and Elf. Movies that actually did *WELL*.",Grease 2

86,Sharbysy,I Loved Both Grease 2 and the Original,9,4 April 2003,"The original Grease was one of my favorite movies of all time. I saw it about 10 times within the first couple of years after it was released.   I missed Grease 2 when it was up at the theater and happened to see years later.   Having heard some negative comments I didn't have my hopes too high, but I really LOVED it just as much as the original.   I loved the chemistry between Michelle Pfeiffer and Maxwell Caulfield, I enjoyed the songs (especially Cool Rider) and I enjoyed watching the supporting cast. This is a fun movie.   I'm so excited that it's going to be released on DVD. I'm going to be one of the first to buy it.",Grease 2
87,thoughtfox,Hard to Beat an Original But...,5,7 July 2006,"OK, so it is not the greatest lead up from a great original musical (and classic)like the first movie was; however, it is not entirely that bad in that it is what it is: a good, comfortable, Saturda or Sunda afternoon flick to watch in your PJs.Grease 2 had a lot of the original ""feel good-ness"" of the first, but the some of the musical numbers were reall not that good. As an example, the number where Stephanie sings with the ""dead"" nerd-turned-lover and newl heart throb, Michael Carrington, plaed by Max Caulfield. In addition, the actor taking over Travolta's part (sort of), Zmed, is not the handsome Travolta Danny Zucco is in the original.All in all, this movie had some pretty big shoes to fill, but it's not a bad little film to help you spend a laz weekend afternoon. So for that kind of entertainment value alone, I give it 5 out 10 stars.Grease is still the word.",Grease 2
88,gardoma,An impressively bad movie that made it to fame,1,29 November 2009,"""Grease 2"" is an example of how bad products (in this case, very bad products) can win market laws, gain momentum, and eventually carve a niche for themselves in the big wall of fame.The reasons for this movie's success are, and will always be, mysterious to me. It obviously carried on the success of the original ""Grease"" (fun music, fan atmosphere, cool actors, and so on). But, besides the first word of the title, the two movies have nothing in common.""Grease 2"" is the story of a total loser who, for some reason that still beats me, falls in love with a total bitch. Just to make the point: The girl is the leader of some gang of sassy high-school idiots who call themselves ""pink ladies"". They think cool, they act cool, and so on. The girl has only one thing that stands up for her: She's Michelle Pfeiffer. Sadly, that's the end.The total loser is Maxwell Caulfield. If his name does not ring a bell, there is more than a good reason for it. Somehow, this guy manages to hide is nerdy loser identity and turn into a night biker (ops... ""cool rider"") and impress the girl. The cool rider dresses like the Village People, but the audience is supposed to think he looks really, really badass. Somehow, his Village People leathergear is enough to make the girl fall for him---and even make other badass bikers jealous (the other bikers are similarly into the Village People). In the very end, the cool biker is revealed to be the loser guy. The girl falls in love with him and he even manages to gain the trust and respect of the other biker dudes.In case you did not get it, the storyline is a boy-meets-girls as braindead as it can be. Still, a screenwriter who actually finished high school could had made something fun out of it. Here, the fun and lighthearted atmosphere comes only from the music (which is still fun), and is used as a patch to cover the absolute lack of writing and directing skills.The direction is embarrassing. The camera simply follows the actors while they move around and sing. Sometimes they have some interesting choreography (the ""cool rider"" song) that the director manages to kill with a plain and unoriginal vision that makes everything look fake. Somebody might think it's intentionally camp. I still think the overall effects is that of a girl, with an expensive camcorder, who is trying to make a costume movie, with her friends, in her garage. The editing gives me the creeps, and is similarly unoriginal everywhere. The most stylish moment is the first time you see the loser guy acting as the cool rider. He appears out of nothing and lights up the girl's cigarette. The scence is a basic and plain alternation of the close-ups of the two. Most of the different movies scenes are lined up without any transition, giving the idea that the movie reels were simply cut after the director says ""action!"", and glued together. In summary, ""Grease 2"" is an astonishing example of how a bad move can gain following. There is no way to save it in name of the ""so bad that it's good"" taste. The reason is that this was not a bad, unskillful, B-movie. This was a reasonably priced production that just happened to gather together some of the worst crew around at that time, who just rushed to finish the movie in time. The only things that still makes it worth is Michelle Pfeiffer. But you have to watch the movie on mute, otherwise you would just want to kill her for the entire time.",Grease 2
89,deejay_bill,"Well, at least there won't be a ""Grease 3""",4,4 July 2000,"This movie isn't as bad as its reputation would suggest, but it is a totally unnecessary follow-up to the 1978 classic. It is sporadically entertaining, and it does have a few things going for it. The early screen appearance of Michelle Pfeiffer is interesting to watch, and I enjoyed her performance. Almost all of the actors are quite likable, actually, giving energetic and engaging performances. And the film boasts the welcome return of Dody Goodman, Eve Arden and Sid Caesar from the original ""Grease.""So what is the problem? First of all, the storyline is rather far-fetched. ""Nerdy"" English student (Sandy's cousin...yeah, right) falls for Pink Lady who wants nothing to do with him, so he learns to ride a motorcycle amazingly quickly and becomes this mysterious ""cool rider"" while the other characters don't even recognize him. I guess it's a Clark Kent/Superman kind of thing. Secondly, the songs are nothing to write home about...actually, the songs from the ORIGINAL film weren't that terrific either, but at least they became hits. Most of the cast members aren't particularly strong singers, but their dedication and energy almost makes up for it. The direction is sluggish, and the editing is poor. But the biggest failure here is the blandly-handsome Maxwell Caulfield in the lead role of straight-A/cool rider Michael Carrington. His performance is dull, his diction is poor, his screen presence is non-existent and his singing is pathetic. And he hasn't done anything noteworthy since.But honestly, the film isn't all bad. Stupid and forgettable, but not necessarily painful. But it is far from a must-see. Watch only if you are too tired to get up and change the channel and the remote isn't working.",Grease 2

No, they just had to continue. Newcomer Maxwell Caulfield plays a Briton--Michael Carrington--who moves to the U.S. and what do you know, the sequel returns to Rydell High in 1961, when the class is about to graduate. He's in love with Stephanie (Michelle Pfeiffer), who is in a club that can only date the Greasers (hence the title) but then the preppy love and music ensues... ugh.

You will learn every line in ""Girl for all seasons"". Even the paltry ""score tonight"" will burn itself into your mind for all eternity.This movie will become a weird obsession and like me you will find yourself unable to resist it.

92,Reyak,Yet Another Sequel,10,19 January 2006,"OK, I hate sequels. Why make a sequel out of a good movie, only to spit on its name? For that matter, if the movie stunk, why make a sequel to remind people?I'm sorry, but Grease stunk. The only thing mildly entertaining about G1 was the final scene, and watching and laughing as John Travolta shook his thang. LOL. Why would you ever make a sequel to a movie that horrible?That being said, why did they make G1 in the first place? G2 should have been the original, it was so good. OK, we have some no name acting here, but a few we know.Maureen Teefy as some of us know played Lois Lanes Cousin, Lucy, from Supergirl. Not the best acting in the world, but she has a cute face that makes up for it.Didi Conn has reappeared as the Beauty School Dropout, Frenchy, from the original movie. She does seem to settle things, and make it feel a bit more like home,....even that voice seems settling...at times.And of course, we all know Michelle Pfeiffer. But frankly, I'm sure most of the boys out there would like to get to know her better,..I know I would. Hint,...buy ALL her movies!OK, so the scene starts off rather familiar. Everyone is coming back to school, sure it isn't the very next day, but I swear I got a Porkys II flashback. I just loved this movie, and...even a few of its songs. Reproduction was quite funny, Score Tonight was great, and very catchy, as was Cool Rider. Still, since Cool rider was Michelle Pfeiffers only solo song, it ranks up there anyway. Love her dance number to it as well.Anyway, I think for a sequel, this movie ruled. I think, however,...grease 1 should have been the sequel. I hope you agree.a cool rider, a cooooooool rider if he's cool enough, he can burn me through and through whoooa if it takes forever, then I'll wait forever.

It's not the worst film overall I've seen, but definitely the one of the worst musical films (out of the very few musical films I've seen).A vast majority of the cast are obscure actors/actresses and the acting is cheesy, very average, uncool and nothing special. Quite a lot of the actors just went over the top in trying to act cool, especially the T-Birds. They went WAY over the top in trying to act cool but it really just came out in such an unimpressive and pathetic way it was almost funny. Although having said that, they did do a bit more than the G1 T-Birds, and they did do one or two things they did that were funny, but of course I laughing at their pitiful expense. They are a bit like 1950's chavs in leather coats. And The Pink Ladies were just way too humble and were a bit bland. Even Michelle Pfeiffer's performance lacked spark albeit pretty good, and Maxwell Caufield was OK from what I remember(it's been a fair few years since I saw this film), and the people who returned from G1. Those twins have to be the most irritating characters of the film. Ugh! Thinking about them almost makes me want to throw up. They also have to be at least two of the most irritating characters in film history. And that song they do. Yuck! Sweet sugary gooey puke! And the music. God help me, the music! Most of the songs are cheesy, irritating, stupid, cringe-worthy, easily forgettable, tasteless, lack charm/emotional power/likable element, and no or pretty much no meaning to them whatsoever.The storyline is cheesy, fairly weak , it's typical, nothing special a bit sleazy and very unoriginal; they switched personalities with genders with the characters. It tried to do better than the original, but failed rather miserably. Grease and musical film fans who haven't seen this, rent this first because you might be disappointed.",Grease 2
94,shugal-87579,Really enjoyed it,8,4 January 2021,"Way over due review but I was happy to see someone also wrote they really liked it too. I think people compare it to #1 and maybe that's why it was rated not good but I totally disagree. I remember my now 18 yr old daughter watching it at 8yrs old and she loved it. I then played the original John travolta version & she was bored with it. I personally like the 1st but honestly Grease 2 has better music, choreography & really good looking actors overall. I read once Michelle Pfieffer almost didn't get Scarface because of this film which is crazy to me. She looked good, danced great & acted well in this light hearted film. I love the actor Maxwell he was so handsome and again the story & music to me was really good. I even gifted the dvd to my daughter who was Gaga over it!!
Sorry folks who disagree but I just rewatched again & it's a great feel good musical & story.",Grease 2
95,flowergirlz_us,I love this movie!,10,25 January 2004,"Don't let the naysayers fool you. No, this movie wasn't as good as the original, but I loved it just as, well, nearly as much as the first.I have to admit, I wasn't wild about the whole biker-in-disguise bit, but if you can get away from that, and the fact that most of the students look like they should be graduating from college, not high-school, this is a heck of a good movie.  The big problem with this movie, is that none of the music had the feel of the sixties to it. It had some good, but generic music. Although I admit to loving two of the movies songs, ""Cool Rider"" was my absolute favorite. So many girls I know have expressed how they saw themselves as Stephanie Zinone, climbing that ladder, lamenting for her Cool Rider fantasy lover. The second is the ""Girl For All Seasons"" number, I just wished they had finished it, before launching into the laughable ""Biker Heaven"" sequence.Michelle Pfeiffer may be embarrassed by this movie. But this fan isn't embarrassed to say how much she loves it and how much pleasure it brought to me as a child. Go Grease 2! You rock!",Grease 2
96,shannasman9,Grease 2,5,11 August 2007,"I thought this movie was OK but I still like the first one was better. This movie isn't even as good as the original. There's a dorky chick in this version. Also I would say that the first movie had a few more songs in it that made sense. And, I think this movie follows right along with the original in that the orders of the songs. They always say that originals are better than the sequel. In this case that is so true. Please enjoy reading this comment. I enjoyed watching Miss McGee in the original but in this one she kind of looks older. This movie came out in the early 80's and I was born in 1985. So that is all I have to say. Thank you and enjoy the show.",Grease 2
97,ShadowGal,Disappointed and appalled,2,15 August 2004,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first Grease movie, as well as its on-stage equivalent--I had the fortune of seeing it performed live in my town, and I adored it. I made the mistake of getting my hopes up over Grease 2. I didn't watch the entire thing, just the first 30 minutes, but I will say this: I want my thirty minutes back.What little part of this film I saw, I watched while babysitting the kid next door. She's, what, five, give or take a year? And this is one of her favorite movies. I pity her. This movie is a piece of junk, no two ways about it! That's where the disappointment came in.Now, you may be wondering about the ""appalled"" part of my summary line. That's easily enough to explain. You see, the little girl I babysat has two older siblings--one about 8, and the other 10. They really like the movie too, and that bothers me. Some of the lines in the songs are very frank in their sexuality. That's not so bad for a five year old who simply won't understand them, or the equally suggestive dance moves that accompany them. A ten-year-old, however, will. I'll be the first to admit that I am literally one of the most liberal, open-minded people you'll ever meet, so it isn't the content itself that I object to. What bothers me is that it's contained within a musical that people let their kids sit down in watch without thinking to worry (since the parents themselves probably wouldn't be able to stomach much more than the first 10 minutes). What I'm basically saying is this: the movie might amuse very small children that aren't paying attention to the lyrics. The tunes themselves aren't too bad, and the dancing can be amusing, especially when you *aren't* paying attention to the lyrics. Older children--about ages 7/8 to, oh, 11, probably don't need to watch this. If anyone above the age of 12 can sit through this entire movie, they have my complete and utter respect--I don't know how they do it.I give this movie a 2 out of 10.",Grease 2
98,janiecerborens,a bit much,7,18 December 2020,"This movie is a bit much and the scenes and music are too goofy for me. The musical scenes and dialogue are quite bad The only reason I watched it was for the smoldering handsome Maxwell Caulfield. When he asks Michelle Pfeiffer's character ""how about the day after tomorrow"" in that sexy tone I about died.",Grease 2
99,chriswells-58451,One of my favorite movies,10,5 April 2021,"I love love love this movie so much. In all
Honesty, I may love it more than the original Grease. Not sure why it has a low rating?!? It's just so much fun. Brings back good memories!!",Grease 2
100,hadar-20,Give this sequel a break,6,23 May 2003,"There areespecially three great sequences in Grease 2: 1) The opening number (Back to School), a great, catchy tune followed by some wonderful dancing, everything a musical should be. 2) ""Score Tonight"" which takes place in a bowling alley. Great song! And it's fun seeing everyone dancing with bowling bowls! 3) The biology class and ""Reproduction"", I dare say you won't stop humming it, hilarious and inventive. Sure, it has its weak spots, including some real cheesy scenes, and maxwell caulfield is no John Travolta (He hardly dances in the picture), he is supposed to look like a ""Cool Rider"" but looks instead like a Villain from the old ""Batman"" show with his ""Cool Rider outfit"". still, do not take this movie too seriously, Grease 2 sure don't deserve all the bad rep it got, and it sure deserves a much higher rating on IMDB. It's a fun little musical, with some great performances, inspired choreography and some really really great songs (And some not so great, but these are in the minority). Michell Pfeiffer is great in this picture and shouldn't be ashamed of it at all. To fully enjoy this, just try to forget that it's a sequel to the most succesful musical of all time (a heavy burden on any film), just call is ""Brilliantine"" or something instead of ""Grease 2"", because as a stand alone musical comedy, this flick delivers the goods.",Grease 2
101,deetdee12,So Bad It's ALMOST Good!!!,5,15 October 2006,"Much to the distress of my husband, I watched this entire train wreck last night and still found myself eerily entranced by it. In many ways, it's a shame that it IS so bad, the choreography is actually quite good (though frequently lost to very bad edits), with some very good dancing by the extras (much like the original, no less).But of course, that can't save horrible acting, tuneless songs (of which there are FAR too many) and an absurd ""plot"". And I don't even mean how Michael becomes a cyclist who out rides guys with years of practice under their belt in less than six months, either. Cause even THAT'S not nearly so unthinkable as: A) the teasing Stephanie is subject to over Michael's crush. Granted, he's a ""nerdy bookworm"", but he's clearly an incredibly handsome nerdy bookworm, while the ""cool guys"" are all dorky looking and acting---making one wonder if perhaps ALL the Pink Ladies need glasses.B) totally hot twin cheerleaders are portrayed as icky prisses that no guy wants----but disheveled Stephanie (and yes, I do consider Michelle to be a very beautiful woman, just not in this movie), in a greasy sweatshirt has every boy panting wildly---as do the other, plain at best, Pink Ladies.C) That anyone could buy any of the pushing 30 actors in this thing as ""teens"".But past that, it's strangely compelling--and fun to watch in a heinous, ""Saved by the Bell"" kind of way..",Grease 2
102,kiwifreund,Grease 2 Was a Vehicle,6,24 December 2018,"No one looked liked they were in high school except for Dolores. I took this movie exactly for what it was when it was when it came out - a practice film so everyone could get time in front of and behind the camera. Sure, the premise is a little thin. Sure, there's motorcycles instead of cars. But Michael was my first British boyfriend (the rest were real). I still quite enjoy the film separately and equally to the original Grease. We are not talking about deep topics.",Grease 2
103,Scot6,What a Terrible Sequel to a Great Movie!!!!!!,1,30 July 2000,"I think most people are accustomed to sequels that are not as good as the originals. There are exceptions of course, such as the Godfather, Lethal Weapon, etc. which had some great follow-ups. Rarely are there sequels as bad as this one is however. It is a perfectly awful movie.
I hate it when film makers try to capitalize on a movie as successful as ""Grease"" by trying to foist junk like this off on the public as a follow-up. The sequel doesn't have the same director, writers or major cast members of the original movie and it shows!  There *are* some decent cast carry-overs from the original movie but they are wasted (as is just about everything else about this movie). I'm sure they must have later regretted lending their considerable names to this disaster.I have rarely heard so many forgettable (read: terrible) songs in one movie. Don't waste your time on this one. Stick with the original. It's incomparably better.",Grease 2
104,Lil' Oz,Not as bad as I had heard,7,5 August 2000,"Don't get me wrong, this is not a great movie.  And it pales in comparison to the original.  I didn't care about the characters as much as I did in the original and the plot was very predictable.  Still...  By itself, it wasn't a bad flick.  Some of the songs were fun and catchy like the original.  It was great to see Frenchy again, too.  It left me with a gentle smile and the satisfying feeling of being adequately entertained for 2 hours.",Grease 2
105,WhisperingBells1959,the worst musical ever,2,8 September 2007,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and THE worst musical. Many of the songs were not about important parts of the plot and did not have to be added (ie reproduction and that bowling song) The choreography SUCKED, so what was so good about it? The love stories sucked too, because they started at probably 3/4 of the movie, and did not make sense at the end!!! It was corny, and you wonder how the heck they could've fallen in love in such a short time. Michelle Pfeiffer had a great voice; too bad she was wasting it on these songs. The plot was so stupid, and the dancing and singing was bad, too. It looked like the choreography was by an amateur and the songwriting was by an amateur. Cool, Mr. Right comes along in about 3/4 of the movie, Stephanie falls in love with him, she falls in love with Micheal. (very rushed and unbelievable) Mr. Right allegedly dies. But wait, Mr. Right comes back!!! And on top of all that, Mr. Right is Micheal, who has learned to ride a motorcycle to impress Stephanie and eventually becomes one of the T-birds.This movie is a complete waste of time and money.",Grease 2
106,VALGAL69au,Worst Movie Ever?,2,26 August 2008,"This movie latches onto the original one way too much. I have tried so many times to watch this film, but I can never watch more than 10 minutes without feeling nauseous. The acting is very mediocre, and all the songs are way too cheesy and sound too similar to each other, as well as being very poorly mimed. The dance sequences practically copy the original Grease movie step for step. Sadly, it is hard to watch this as an independent film OR a sequel, as it follows the same mold too closely - it is a blatant rip off. All the characters are the exact same stereotypes and half the one-liners are even identical. There's the leader of the T-birds, the cool side kick, the two ditsy followers, likewise with the Pink Ladies. Then of course there is the teachers, crater face etc, all the same characters but with different names and played by different actors. The only thing different about this movie is that their ""cool wheels"" are motorbikes not cars, and the roles of the two lead characters are reversed (i.e the female is the cool chick and the male tries to change so that he can win her heart). Truly a very hard film to watch if you have ever seen the original Grease, which is such a high energy and timeless movie. I'd only recommend it if you have never seen the original movie.",Grease 2

110,katstar1982,Dirty and Disturbing,1,5 December 2006,"When I was 11, Grease 2 was like crack. It was a classless, shameful, euphoric, and powerfully addictive experience. My sister and I would watch it, rewind it, and watch it over again and again and again until we passed out or became too confused and hostile to stand one another. So, if you are an 11-year old girl, and you reviewed this film as ""brilliant"" or ""fun"" or ""better than the original Grease,"" you have your fledgling adolescent hormones to blame and you can rest assured that this unyielding fixation with utter rubbish will pass.If, however, you are not a little girl, you have absolutely no excuse to suggest that Grease 2 was anything but an inane, artless, slipshod embarrassment for all who participated in its production, distribution, and/or consumption.For the sake of criticism, I will dignify the film now by explaining why it blows 1. In a well-executed musical, the songs should advance the narrative or develop the characters. In Grease 2, with a few debatable exceptions, to the music is obscenely pointless. Most of the songs appear to relate gimped innuendo about sex in an excessive and general way (""Score Tonight,"" ""Reproduction,"" ""Do It For Our Country,"" and ""Prowlin'"") without making one concrete statement about any of the film's characters or themes. Plus, all of the music is uncomfortably stupid and no one in the cast demonstrates even the crudest semblance of an ability to sing or dance.2. The T-birds should be badass, and if not at least somewhat likable, but instead each of them is an annoying wussy-dufus-loser. In the end, when Johnny Nogerelli offers Michael the sacred T-bird jacket and initiates him into the gang, Michael should kick it to the ground, spit on it, and duck away to fervently scrub any part of his body that was touched by it. But of course, he accepts it as if it is gold because despite the fact that they are a bunch of bumbling meatheads, there is no greater honor than to be one with the T-birds. 3. Since Michael is beautiful, smart, kind, resourceful, and above average in everyway (his musical impotence notwithstanding), it is feasible that Stephanie would ultimately embrace him when he reveals himself to be the man behind the mask. Stephanie, on the other hand, is a slovenly, slack-jawed, bubble gum smacking, dirty sweatshirt wearing, gracelessly rude and trashy dingbat. So aside from being pretty (I guess), she harbors no likable characteristics, thus, audiences are given no justification whatsoever for the depth of Michael's attraction to her.I could go on and on, but I didn't want to mention the gross inferiority to its predecessor since there are apparently so many cranks out there who seem to feel that such a comparison is unfair. I will say this though, to those of you who think you want to revisit this mess for old time's sake: Grease 2 is an experience akin to re-living your first kiss. Only you are 32 now and kissing a snot-nosed 13-year old kid with acne and slobby braces. The magic is gone and you are left feeling dirty and disturbed. Trust me.",Grease 2

Characters jump from scene to scene without any sense whatsoever. The music is terribly bland and soulless. The only decent thing is the acting by Michele pfeifer. This movie should be in the list of terrorist organisations.
Lastly, the subtext of the film, in order to get your girl you don't need her approval, the permission that matters is that of the man that things he ""owns"" her.

Grease 1 was bad enough but at least the songs had some merit and the leads and Channing held it together. This however replaces the songs with dirges, the lyrics with doggerel and the sometimes glitzy '50s production design with campy nonsense. Horrible. The only thing they keep from the original is having fools run around with their chav mates.The film is also, one must remember extremely boring. It's pitched at such an infantile level one wonders who the target audience is. There's not enough action or slapstick for the under 5s which are surely the only ones satisfied by the story.Nasty cheap junk.

First of all, how can Stephanie not tell that it's Michael on the bike? Does the helmet and glasses completely throw her off? He doesn't even change his accent! That said, the movie is deliciously entertaining. Some of the songs are lame (""Charade"") but that's completely forgivable. My very favorite is the talent show. The original Grease is infinitely better, though. One time, I read a review that gave Grease and Grease 2 the same rating. I am deeply concerned for the author of this review.",Grease 2

Then I found out there was a whole cult following, and I thought, ""Wow, somebody else gets it!""Anybody who calls this movie inane and stupid is missing the point. Of course, it's inane and stupid. It's supposed to be. Grease 2 doesn't take itself seriously, and nobody else should, either.It plays itself off as a parody of the cheesy 60's biker movies, and it does a beautiful job. The lighting and camera work in the ""Who's That Guy"" sequence go perfectly with the song. And anybody who can sit all the way through ""Reproduction"" without getting the joke and cracking up laughing never took sex education in high school.

117,Zinone,My favorite movie of all time!,10,29 May 2000,"Ok first off I just gotta say this movie changed my life in 1982. I was 12 years old and this movie did so much for me I can't begin to tell you all. It made such a lasting impression on me and will always hold dear in my heart.  This movie not only gave us Michelle Pfeiffer in her first ever starring role, but it also gave us Maxwell Caulfield and some great music. I consider Michelle's ""Cool Rider"" to be one of the greatest pop/rock songs ever written! It may not be a great composition, but its the coolest, slickest piece of movie music since ""Greased Lightnin'"" and ""You're The One That I Want"". This movie marked an end to an era of movie musicals and not since has there been any musicals of its calibur. I don't know where it all went wrong, but Hollywood stopped making musicals. This film is truly underrated. So many people can't see the fun and wonderfulness of this movie and it's a shame. People are so hung up on the sillyness of it, but get a clue, that is what movie musicals are all about. Look at every Elvis movie and look at Grease for goodness sake. A true classic and its really building a following nowadays. Grease.....it's still the word. The Music and Feeling Go on Forever. Pinks and Birds for ever!",Grease 2
118,Zinone,"Grease 2 stands on its own, people shoudn't compare......",10,11 March 2001,"You know, I am sick of people comparing this movie to its predecessor. It was never meant to be Grease. It is its OWN movie, with Michelle Pfeiffer in a role she was born to play.  It's a hip and cool movie, with some great tunes, some corny tunes as well but all in all a fun time.  I wish people would cut it some slack and give it the respect it deserves. It never hurt anyone, it never did anything wrong, people should just sit back and enjoy the innocence and magic that is Grease 2.  It is alot better than the sick twisted movies that the studios put out these days that is for sure. Just good, clean fun! The Music and Feeling go on Forever........",Grease 2
119,ConStar8788,"Good at the time, but didn't age so well...",7,12 July 2008,"Depending on when you saw this film relative to when you saw the original ""Grease,"" your viewpoints probably differ as to the quality of this movie.I saw both within a month of each other at age 13. I hated the original and loved this one.As I've gotten older, I've come to recognize that the original is a better piece of work, overall. The music from the original is better when taken as a whole. The supporting cast of the original has better players. The storyline doesn't seem as convoluted at times.But there's something about this movie that holds on to you. It appeals much more to the age group pictured in the movie (i.e., junior-high and high-schoolers). The song ""Cool Rider"" and the scenes that accompany it in the movie rival anything in the original.The dialog is better in places and the interplay between the male and female leads are better, I believe, than in the original. The original movie's pairing of Travolta and Newton-John gave us a dimwit trying to woo a goodie-two-shoes girl whose performance was oftentimes wooden and uncomfortable. This one gives us Caulfield and Pfeiffer, and the interplay between an intelligent, wise-beyond-his-years male lead and the ""wild child"" female lead.Adrian Zmed's supporting performance as Johnny still cracks me up and is one of the few performances from this movie that still entertain me as an adult.That's because outside of the performances of accomplished character actors Christopher McDonald, Eve Arden and Dody Goodman, the rest of this cast is just plain bad. Some of it is bad acting, some of it is miscasting and a lot of it is bad writing.What we're left with today, 20-something years later, is a movie that made a really good attempt to build on the original, but in the end, was the soufflé that fell. It's still better than most want to admit, but it could have stood a couple of rewrites and a little more attention to detail in the prospective cast interview room.",Grease 2
120,CareALotsClouds,Let it stand on its own,10,7 November 2003,"I grew up with both of the Grease films but I must say, Grease 2 is my favourite and there are many reasons.  It does have the same kind of formula as the orginal Grease but is dealt with in a completely different way. Danny faniced Sandy back, but Stephanie (played by the young Michelle Pfhieffer) doesn't even give Michael (Caulfield) a second glance.  Also, instead of cars, a motorbike is the new 'thing' to have.Michael Carrington, a straight A student from England, transfers to Rydell High and is immediately put into the 'nerd' category and the T-Birds brand him 'Shakesphere'.  He is smart, extremely uncool and very shy.Stephenie, the leader of the Pink ladies has come back from the summer holidays having broke up with Johnny, the T-Birds leader, having grown out of him.  Johnny is clearly still interested in Stephanie but she doesn't want to know.  Her loyalty to the Birds has faltered as she wants someone even cooler.First day back Stephanie sees the Birds picking on Michael and defends him, from that moment on Michael vows to become a T-Bird and win her heart.So there is the story, but what Grease is famous for is the memorable songs, and this film has them!  There are 12 songs on the soundtrack and there isn't one that I really skip.  The music has changed since the first Grease as it was made in the decade of the 80's.  Its early 80's rock that you are getting yourself into for the most part.  You have the romanitc songs (Turn Back The Hands Of Time, We'll Be Together, Charades), the heavy rock songs (Cool Rider, Who's That Guy), the happy-go-dancing songs (Score Tonight, Back To School), the sweet songs (Love For All Seasons) and the down right silly songs (Reproduction, Prowlin').  These are all songs that stick in your mind and just can't stop singing them to yourself.  All the songs are quality and stand on their own.  Absolutely brilliant soundtrack.What would Grease be without the classic characters?  We have the T-Birds who are actually not cool in any way or form, its only the leader (Johnny) who is 'cool', the others just follow his lead.  Johnny is a classic character who makes you laugh over and over again, its hilarious whenever he loses his cool.  Frenchy unfortunately doesn't have a big part in the film but nethertheless she is there.  The coach is back but you only see him twice if that.  Mrs Mcgee and Blanche are also back making quite a funny duo as they did last time.  Two new teachers; a very sexy female who always has low cut tops on and pays $500 for her hair (according to the cheer leading twins).  She falls for the unlikely nerdy substitute teacher, Mr Stewart, who teaches the immortal 'Reproduction' lesson.  The new Pink ladies have very distinctive characters, one of them is obsessed with her nose and doesnt come into it much (Rhonda), Paulette is somewhat the second leader in my view who has a crush on Johnny, she does have her own intentions but she does care for her friends; nothing like Riz.  Sharon is a bubbly flirty character who is the prey of one of the T-Birds (Louis) to get into bed. Then there is Dolores, Paulettes little sister who isn't a Pink lady but a pink lady mascot, she looks about 12, mouthy and carries a skate board everywhere.The performances were actually very good in my humble opinion, especially Max Caulfield who seemed very uncomfortable... and that is the way Michael is supposed to be!  He wins me over with those puppy innocent eyes, then when he is the mysterious guy he acts completely cool.  Max was a triumph. His voice isn't the best thing in the world but he didn't sing that much anyway.  Michelle Pfhieffer was wonderful as an actress and singer.  When you hear her sing you won't need to wonder why Andrew Lloyd Webber wanted her as Evita in his film musical and NOT Madonna.  She shines in 'Cool Rider'.  The whole cast was believable.  I normally sit back in films and watch peoples performances and dig at them but I didnt do that at all in this movie.This film has a lot of negative feedback as every one compares it to the Original Grease.  My opinion isnt common, preferring this one to the original, therefore my advice to you is to forget the first movie when watching this one.  It needs a chance!",Grease 2

122,Rascutin,This is an underrated movie!!!,9,7 August 2014,"4.1!!! Whoa! This wasn't a bad movie at all! Sure, it wasn't nearly as good as the first movie, but it still was good! Grease had an excellent cast with John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John. Stockard Channing was downright hilarious as Rizzo, but she was just way too old to be playing a high school senior. But in Grease 2, Lorna Luft seemed young enough to play a character like that. Sure John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John were good looking people, but they weren't as hot as Maxwell Caulfield (SO CUTE) and Michelle Pfeiffer. Plus, I even thought some of the songs from this movie were better than the ones in the first. ""Hopelessly Devoted To You,"" ""Beauty School Dropout,"" and ""Sandy"" were incredibly cheesy songs. But in the sequel, I can't think one song that was cheesy. But, I will say the intro and closing song in the first were a lot better than ones in the sequel. To sum it all up, this is a funny, charming, and underrated movie. 9/10 stars.",Grease 2

124,libbyswin,You can't let it stand on its own when it's a sequel!,1,28 October 2018,"Painful. Painful is the first word to pop into my head. GREASE had such musical and dance quality that this fails miserably at. The actors themselves were fine (I'm shocked Phieffer was able to make something of her career after this). The movies that bad. It's a musical. So the songs have to be GREAT. Something memorable. They are mostly melodic and not snappy. Few solos and if there are, horrible. Maxwell and Michele are the only bright spots. Zmed tries too hard to be Zuko.The musics to enhanced for a better word. To many background instruments. To much voice enhancement. Doesn't feel fresh at all.If i could say one more thing, every single song in the original Grease is memorable. Every character. The singing felt comfortable and didn't require a lot except the great voices. Grease 2 is just the opposite. No song will sound familiar because non was a hit or done well. This movie should never ever have been made. I'm ashamed at Stigwood!!!",Grease 2
125,noelani54,"Some good content, but some pretty dead time, too! No spoilers!",4,16 August 2017,"I would never have made it through this had I not been too sick to do anything else. However, there are some good parts. Some of the singing and dancing numbers are fairly good and some of the characters work well together. The biggest problem, as I see it, is that neither of the two leads is much involved in any good numbers. I don't see a shred of chemistry between the leads, either. Maybe if someone else was in the role of Stefanie it might have improved things, but Michele Pfeiffer just isn't believable as a tough Italian girl (or a singer or dancer).I think Lorna Luft, although a bit old to play a high school student, did a very good job, although I wish there had been a number that showed off her voice. Another standout, in my opinion, was Leif Green, as Davey. I don't know why they would have him in a side car, rather than his own motorcycle. That was silly, but I think he did a great job with the role. If only the film had been stronger, it might have led to more of a career, for him. It was apparently expected to establish a career for Maxwell Caulfield, as well as Michele Pfeiffer. Although he was definitely very cute, I didn't really see much in the way of solid talent, there. While Michele Pfeiffer, although miscast in this film, in my opinion, did demonstrate some solid acting talent and later got the roles to prove it.",Grease 2
126,lizzylane-85151,Lacking... something,1,31 May 2018,"Being a huge fan of the original Grease film I have pushed myself a few times now to try and like Grease 2. It's only the last time I watched it again that I came to see it's actually completely different in genre and atmosphere to original Grease. While the original is a fun, young adult's musical, providing some historically accurate moderate sexual undertones, fantastic songs, iconic one-liners delivered by charismatic actors and characters, Grease 2 I think is attempting more a comedic vibe - not that it's my particular type of humour. The songs are just not that well written, the actors for the most part are not at all charismatic and most are quite weak. Something is very lacking, I still can't figure out just what, it's just missing alot... it just doesn't hold my interest, like... at all. I don't feel at all invested in the storyline, the characters or the songs. As I say, I tried.",Grease 2

Haven't seen the first one ever(cause i do not like JT as an actor in general.OK maybe except Look Who's Talking movies). I accidentally watched Grease 2 on rerun TV. I have found both Michelle and Maxwell a very charming on screen couple. They had a great chemistry and portrait the main characters very well(Max was hot and Michelle OMG lovely). On the music side, I was blown away by the songs. If you're saying they are bad, you probably haven't even bothered to listen to them in full. Straight after watching I have ordered the CD. It may have not generated so many hits like the Grease ""One""... maybe because of the short time-frame between these two movies. Like the other reviewers already said. Do not compare it to the original. Watch it as an independent production. If you haven't seen the Grease ""One"" watch this one first and then the original. I am sure you will like this one better.",Grease 2
129,athousanddreams,One of my favorite 80's flicks,7,12 July 2003,"This movie was the coolest when I was 12.  I never particularly liked Grease (so cliche and pretty predictable), so when my cousin wanted to rent Grease 2, I wansn't too thrilled.  But, it ended up being one of my favorite movies as a kid.  Maybe it was because of my semi-dislike for the original, but I just thought this one shined in comparison.  The songs were much more fun, Stephanie wasn't lame, like Sandy, she was cool.  Sandy was a wimp.  I also liked the message of 'cool girl can still go out with semi-geeky guy and still be cool.'  Much more positive than the message of 'girl changing herself to be liked again by guy.'  If you love Grease, you won't like Grease 2 simply because it's not Grease.  And if you're older than 16, you'll probably think it's stupid.  But, as a 12 year old, I loved this kitschy and fun movie and still think it's pretty great today.  Too bad there aren't any extras on the DVD.  I would have loved to see outtakes.",Grease 2

Good looking girls, a catchy soundtrack, and a silly story made for an overly entertaining flick. It is nowhere near the first Grease in terms of quality, but I don't think the filmmakers intended to improve on the original as I don't think that would have been possible. Reding some of the scathing remarks about this movie makes me laugh. It is not bottom 100 bad by any means. My one huge complaint about this is that Maxwell Caulfield can't sing to save his life. Dubbing would have been a good thing. But look at the great characters. Johnny, Goose, Louis, Paulette, Sharon, Steph. Look at the great and fun songs. Cool Rider, Reproduction, Lets do it for our country. Good good stuff. 8 out of 10",Grease 2

This film is continually slammed, as when I mention that I think it is better in some ways than the original, I am slapped in the face, yet it does not deserve so, and people need to realise just how brilliant Grease 2 really is (at least as a musical, its powerful dramatic content could be debated slightly).

And, I never knew that Pfeiffer could sing, but she really shows off her singing talents here.  But, then there are the bad points like the song when Stephanie (Pfeiffer) thinks that the Cool Rider (Caulfield) has died and the reappearance of villian from the original.

Michelle does a good job in ""Cool Rider"". the cast song ""Who's that guy"" is Amazing.The soundtrack version of""do it for your country"" is better than the movie version"" but the songs that caught my eye are ""prowlin"", ""Girl for all seasons"", ""we'll be together"" and ""Love will turn back the hands of time"" when i first really heard that song i was blown away.Musically this movie is a Match for Grease, storyline wise it is not. but it's not bad either.i hope you enjoy this film. i did",Grease 2

I understand that many fans don't like Grease 2 to be compared to the original Grease, but even as a standalone movie it's cheesy. The gang members of the T-Birds are about as cool as Eugene the local nerd and most of the Pink Ladies seem to have room for rent upstairs (and downstairs, if you listen to some of the songs). Michael (Maxwell Caulfield) doesn't seem to realize the Catch-Of-The-Day Stephanie (Michelle Pfeiffer) is possibly less of a catch than little Dolores (Pamela Adlon) who isn't even old enough to be dating any of the T-Birds. Oh well, at least she's genuinely interested in being Michael's friend. Not enough screen time for her or for Frenchy (Didi Conn) who is seen messing with mysterious chemicals in several of her cameos. They're cameos, not an actual role: not enough screen time for an actual role.The songs are less than memorable but some of them make you laugh if only because of their obvious sexual innuendos. I'm not an expert on singing but at least the characters in Grease 2 beat out currently-popular Hannah Montana and most of the Jonas Brothers' songs.One last thing: Why can't the nerds in my school be studs?",Grease 2

143,jkuhn01,Grease 2 is a classic,8,24 September 2007,"I'm so tired of all of the critiques of this film being so awful.. obviously those are people who cannot simply have a good time watching a movie but instead live for the moment where they may dissect and analyse every bit and piece ad nauseam until the entire film is just ruined. If Grease 2 is such a disaster, why is it that I first watched it in second grade when it was released and can now watch it over and over again at age 34 when it appears on the Sky movie channels? I love watching the male leads, I love the cheesy songs, particularly the dream sequence during the talent show, and I love seeing Michelle in what I think is the role in which she looked most beautiful, save maybe Scarface. Today it was on again for the thousandth time, and yes, I did wonder how they allowed for the fact that Michael wasn't playing the piano during the talent show, but then I just pretended that he was only needed for the auditions as they could have had someone professional play for the real show. OK, OK, indulge me. The point is, considering that my favourite movies are more serious films like Deerhunter, Scarface and Cool Hand Luke, there's no way you can argue that I simply have no taste. It's probably more appealing to women anyway who like watching hotties like Maxwell Caulfield and who appreciate singing and dancing in films. Even if the singers are far from good. Who cares about 18 wheelers in the background and Maxwell's bad voice and Michelle's bad acting? Clearly some of you are those people who watch your movies with fingers poised on the pause and rewind buttons anxiously waiting for the director to screw up. Loosen up people. It's a fun movie where the boy gets the girl. Jeez.",Grease 2

I sang along all the songs (still do) and couldn't wait to finally own the soundtrack (which now, i do, after searching for years). I recognized Maxwell Caulfield from Dynasty, so i loved him at first sight too. I can honestly say it's one of my favorite films. Because of Michelle, Maxwell, the songs, the memory.

I based my whole coolness on that of the pink ladies. I wore satin jackets and even got one from my parents with my name on it. (Although it was purple) I didn't f-in care. I am sure if I had seen the ""OG"" first I would feel differently, but I didn't, so I love Grease 2 more.... And I know a lot of people my age that feel the same way.

148,SetzersGretsch,Some Movies Shouldn't Have Sequels,3,20 October 2005,"When you take into consideration that the original ""Grease"" movie was such a phenomenal success with movie-going audiences the world over, is it any surprise that the sequel to one of the highest grossing musicals in cinematic history, fell short of matching or -heaven forbid- even surpassing the achievement of it's predecessor? Of course it wasn't a surprise, and I'm sure that upon it's general release, there were one or two executives at Paramount Pictures that wished they hadn't even bothered making the movie in the first place - and the reason for that being is simply: some movies should be left to bask in their own glory without being bastardised and diluted with one or more sequels. ""Grease 2"" is one such example.Whether you want to compare ""Grease 2"" with the original or take an unbiased view and appraise it on it's own, nothing can hide the fact this really is a terrible movie. So where did ""Grease 2"" go wrong? For one, the entire movie script is more or less a rehash of the original (albeit in some instances, the male/female roles have been reversed to disassociate this from being a straight remake). Take the main love angles in both movies for example: in the first movie, you had the cool kid (Travolta) falling for the ""square"" new-kid-in-town girl (Newton-John), and in the sequel, it's the same, but the roles are gender reversed. Originality seemed lost on the script-writers, and this was further evident during the whole movie, especially during the end-of-school-year carnival where the 'square' kid (Michael) is finally accepted - a scene that's blatantly ripped off from the original ""Grease"".The original ""Grease"" cast never won awards for their acting abilities, but compared to those relative unknowns (back in 1982) who secured the leading roles in the sequel, they make John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John seem like Oscar winners because their acting abilities ranged from 'acceptable' to 'dire', with the latter description perfectly summing up the majority of the cast of ""Grease 2"". Moreover, the injection of old, supporting actors from the first movie (Frenchy and Eugene especially) seemed questionable too. Granted, ""teachers"" were understandable returnees, but Frenchy returning to Rydell High two years after she left to supposedly enter 'beauty school' (and dropped out almost immediately as her character explained in the first movie) and, like the Eugene character, had already graduated. Why were they even in the movie, other than to make an association between the two films? To give the casting people credit, at least for the second movie they hired actors who, at least, looked like teenagers which couldn't be said about the first ""Grease"".Whereas the soundtrack is what the original will be best remembered for, the songs used in ""Grease 2"" were a lot to be desired. With the exception of the terrific opening number (""Back To School Again"" performed by the Four Tops) and ""Who's That Guy?"" (with the former being the best song from both movies IMO), the quality of the songs matched the acting ability on show. ""Prowlin'"", ""Do It For Our Country"" and ""Reproduction"" were all appalling and the worst on offer; ""Cool Rider"" and the sexual innuendo laced, ""Score Tonight"" were passable as songs (even if the accompanying dance scenes were so bad, they were actually hilarious - see Ms Pfeiffer strut to ""Cool Rider"" and you'll see what I mean); ""Charades"" is actually a lovely ballad, or it would've been if someone other than Mr Caulfield had sung it, yet it was quite 'dark' and featured in something of a noir-ish scene that didn't really belong in the movie. The rest of this rather short soundtrack is made up with what can only be described as uninteresting fillers.As for the characters themselves, it seems the 'Pink Ladies' have become the most dominant gang at Rydell High because those characters are the most strongest, especially the roles of Stephanie (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Paulette (Lorna Luft). Despite the fact that the 'T-Birds' epitomised everything ""cool"" in the original, they seem to have turned into a group of geeks in this movie. Adrian Zmed (""Johnny"") and Christopher McDonald (""Goose"") are certainly no John Travolta and Jeff Conaway, neither were their characters. Didi Conn reprised the exact same role she had in the first movie as Frenchy, someone present in the movie to introduce the ""new kid"" to the ways of the school and what it took to be 'cool'. Unfortunately, in ""Grease 2"", we'd seen it all before and her character seemed 'tired'. To their credit, Michelle Pfeiffer and Maxwell Caulfield played their characters well, and unlike the majority of the cast, they did seem 'believable'. Pfeiffer, in the role of the street smart, hard-as-nails head of the 'Pink Ladies' and Caulfield, the stereotypical upper class British teenager (of 1961) did have something of an on-screen chemistry, but were sadly let down by their supporting actors.It really is unfair to compare this movie with the original, but it is a sequel after all - a movie with more than just a few connections to the first, so it's understandable that's the view people will have. In fact, there's no comparison at all. The original was great. this movie isn't. It really is as simple as that.",Grease 2

I saw this movie 3 times in the movie theaters upon release.  2ndly, I think the movie is compared TOO much to the first one.  If it was named anything else and didn't have a ""2"" tacked on to the name, it might not be reviewed so harshly.  If it was called BACK TO RYDELL or something along those lines, who knows how it would have been viewed.  Yes, I will admit it that G2 DOES have it's flaws and faults.  I LUV Michelle Pfeiffer ever since this movie, but at times she DOES look like she wants to be somewhere else.  LOL!!  And personally, they could have given Michael and Stephanie a little more time together to get to know each other.  It might have made the ending a little more believable. Some of the acting is not great, but alot of the acting in the first one wasn't great either.All in all, this movie ROCKS!!  I know alot of people who LOVE this movie. It didn't make as much at the box office compared to G1, but I think it might have hit the 20 million mark after all was said and done. Obviously, not EVERYONE hates this movie.Another criticism about this movie was that it didn't have any of the original cast in it (with the exception of a handful).  It's funny, because Grease 3 is in the works, with ALOT of the original cast members (including ONJ and JT).  If this movie tanks, I wonder what critics are going to say then?Like I said...GREASE 2 is a great musical and should NOT be compared to the first one.  The music is upbeat and funny at times and it is a feel good movie.  My only complaint (from Paramount) is that the DVD should have had some of those deleted scenes and maybe an audio commentary by some of the cast members and perhaps a trailer.",Grease 2
157,lb1xxxx,Re: Did I miss something?,10,1 July 2003,"HiActually, I don't think that originally they were going to make it a ""is he or isn't he"" type thing (as far as Michael being dead).  From what I remember from the book, Michael was alive and he actually wakes Stephanie up from a daydream or something backstage.  So I think when they decided on this storyline, they didn't take into consideration that he was suppose to play the piano.Also, if you look closely on the DVD, during the luau scene (while they are still singing), you can see Michael sitting on the edge of the pool eating cotton candy.Hope this answer helped.",Grease 2
158,paypalscam9002,Better than Grease 1..,10,2 February 2013,"I have no idea what is wrong with people bashing on this movie.Grease 2 is really really a great movie. I have watched it more than 10 times in my life and each time i'm having great fun watching it.I am very picky when it comes to movies. Most movies that i enjoy usually end up with an Oscar for best movie picture or something.Grease 2 is one of the few rare movies that i enjoy watching but didn't get any award.The way i see this is that Grease 2 is meant for a different type of audience.Back when i was in college, we (guys) had to impress girls in order to get them. We had to be cool, we had to be unreal (almost fake), we were creating an image to impress the girls. Of course, i don't do that anymore, (not as much. I'm married, got kids, and still got my motorcycle etc. But one thing that has changed since my college days is that i am more connected to reality now than i was in college.Grease 2 is about a nerds (maxwell) that wants THE Chix (pfeiffer ) but to do that he can't stay natural, he can't be himself so he has to impersonate an image. You see, this is exactly the daily reality for many teenagers. Observe how our teenagers behave today. No different than in Grease 2 (minus the music).I must admit, i was also a Geek guy trying to be cool, dreaming about some (impossible to get girl), when i was in college...and there was. Girls that (20 years later) i wish i had got even if my current wife is a very cute and sexy slim woman...Watching Grease 2 reminds me how i was in college. (like maxwell actually). To be more exact, i wished i was like maxwell. Because in Grease 2 he made it, he succeed getting pfeiffer. But in really it is much more complicated almost impossible for a Geek guy to get the most beautiful girl because the most beautiful girl usually can pick any guy she want.Being an educator in a high school, i can tell you that sex is probably to most spoken subject in our teenagers conversation and concern.To summarize: Grease 2 (from a guy point of view) is a movie for anyone who felt at one point in their college year in love with an (impossible to get girl). A guy who likes to dream and do crazy things just to impress someone, a good guy in nature.Grease 2 is a masterpiece (atleast) for some audience...I give it a 10/10 to re-balance that thrash reviews this movie has got but the real score should be around 8/10 objectively.",Grease 2

It has great music sequences that can make you laugh over and over, my favourite being ""reproduction"".The first Grease was a classic and, though this can never get to that status, it is still great! the pure cheese is something you dont see as often now and is something really needed on tv and in the movies.

160,julia_zesentachtig,An insult to the original Grease,1,2 October 2004,"It is so most of the time that a sequel is so much worse than the original movie. Grease 2 is the proof of that. It totally makes no sense. It is a weak version of Grease and besides they start singing for no reason. It is an outrage, this movie. A total waste of time. And the story about the dork that becomes a hero motorcycle dude to win the heart of the pretty girl: not original, not realistic, not fun. And what about the T-Birds and the Pink Ladies. In Grease those are just bands, a group of some friends. In Grease 2 they are all of a sudden some sort of tradition: when you're a senior and very popular you are a T-Bird or a Pink Lady. That makes no sense. And what is Frenchy doing at Rydell? I thought she dropped out of beauty school (remember beauty school drop out??) and graduated from Rydell. Grease 2 is an insult to the original Grease and totally not worth seeing. Trust me, you don't want to waste an evening with this movie.",Grease 2

Give it a chance, gosh.That said I really can't say this was a very good film, but I enjoyed it. The story was a great idea, I think it just suffered from faulty script and a miscast when it came to the T-Birds and the Pink Ladies.A simple formula: Boy wants girl, girl won't give boy the time of day, boy works hard and even changes his image for this girl and eventually gets her as she realizes she wanted him along.Overall, I say the movie was cute. It was the cute little movie that couldn't, but hey, look what happened to Michelle Pfeiffer! SO be happy for that. I say-5 out of 10.",Grease 2

Its not Oscar worthy for crying out loud, but very fun and enjoyable nonetheless. My fave scenes/songs, Cool Rider, Whose That Guy, Reproduction, We Be Together (great slowed down version, Pfeiffer has some sweet pipes!). But my ultimate fave sexy scene hands down is when Michael rides into the gas station on an unsuspecting Stephanie. The way he asks ""how 'bout that ride"" and the way his hand is resting on his thigh...whew..good lord! The stunt Pfeiffer does with the stuntman on the bike is jaw dropping and probably wouldn't be done today on an actor/actress. Fun movie!",Grease 2

OK so the film is a little cheesy, but does it really matter? I really enjoyed Michelle Pfeiffer and Maxwell Caulfield's performances, I think they went well together on screen. There are also lots of comical moments to be had, plenty to make you smile! All in all I think there is a lot to be enjoyed here.

165,goteverlastinglife,Shame on me- 39 years to watch this movie.,10,10 January 2021,"Grease was a huge part of my childhood. I seen it at the theater 22-23 times, can't quite remember the exact number. Of course owned the VHS, and the Special Edition DVD with cast interviews and the like. Seen it numerous more times. It was THE movie I cherished more than even the great Star Wars.But, this is about Grease 2. I didn't want to watch Grease 2 when it came out. It didn't have John Travolta and Olivia Newton- John in it, therefore it seemed like a cheap imitation or at the time a shoddy low budget Broadway production. Why didn't they invest more money in it? Probably, just the passage of time. Silly Hollywood always moving at the speed of light. They were probably already bored with Grease and moving in new and other directions.So I always shunned this movie. Let's jump a lot of time and come to the year 2021. Wow, we just went to hell and back in 2020 with the Covid-19 pandemic and the political darkness storm that plagued the great USA. A new day has come, the storms are passing as I write this, America is being shaken up, and we are being freed now. There is just so a great peace now that is moving all over the country. People are starting sense it. I have been 100% liberated from every storm and just been experiencing total peacefulness all around. So I see Grease and Grease 2 are coming on TV this day. After all the mess 2020, and a new beginning 2021, I say to myself, maybe, I should finally watch Grease 2. So I come here to IMDB and read a few reviews. They movie is rated horribly at 4.4 stars. But, the reviews, a lot of them, they say something different. And I decide, yes, today is the day that I will finally watch Grease 2.Immediately, I was drawn right in this movie. The movie moves well, sometimes really fast, other times slower. Great balance. I was always into what was happening in 1961 and really I just ended up loving this great flick.Grease 2 isn't really a simple film, Grease is a little simpler, in my opinion. Grease 2 comes out crazier than the original, but yet, it has it's tender moments as well. I think 2 has a lot things happen in it, but so does 1. 2 has a huge cast, 500, great music (I was really surprised), because the music from 1 was so great. The music styles are little different, I guess mainly the year differential. Kind of Rock and Roll High School versus Rock and Roll college.",Grease 2

I thought it was well made. The music is very good. The acting is good, the dancing as well. The huge cast of 500 are good. The movie keeps you involved. The pictures at the end are good.

There is only had a few things in common and thats Frenchy (from what I remember she does not even have that much of a part) the T-birds and Pink ladies and the same high school. It's not that the movie was bad it is just that it is not relative to the original. A better sequel would be having Sandy and Danny get married and them going to a high school reunion. But that is not what happened it had something to with Frenchies cousin from England and how hes in love with a girl who is out of his league.

I enjoyed the first although, at times I couldn't relate in same way as first one gets quite fanciful with total fantasy scenes seemingly included for no good reason as story was sound, which this one didn't thankfully as they spoilt first one for me ~ I stated to friends and family at the time that they should watch out for this actress as she would be a star (only time I've ever thought that) ~ Do yourself a favour if you can, watch this one first and then makeup your own mind.

So then this nerd guy who wears glasses tries to talk to her and her reaction is basically ""Ew you're a nerd"" but magically he takes off the glasses and puts on bike goggles and learns to ride a motor cycle and she falls in love with him because he's on a motor cycle.

The only noticeable flaw was the lack of period music that filled up the first films soundtrack. There are times when it doesn't have the feel of the early 60's and that could have been fixed with more backround music typical of the era. I think most people missed the way too subtle comedy touches such as the T-BIRDS smoking and chewing bubble gum at the same time. They are trying to look older and very cool, yet they are not willing to give up the bubblegum of their youth. Clever! The staging of its musical numbers is great in that it utilizes unusual settings such as a bowling alley, bomb shelter and a boys v.s. girls sex education classroom song. Maxwell Caulfield sings beautifully and and more than pulls his share of the weight of this picture, Adrian Zmed is less lucky and almost sinks the whiny but bouncy ""SCORE TONIGHT"" number.But then we come back to the very subtle comic antics of having included NUNS in the bowling alley production, singing and dancing with the rest of the gang!

Then to show her independence, turning her reversable pink ladies jacket inside out to show a shiny black jacket?Great images!

The two are very different in tone and execution.Grease 2 is a light-hearted FUN movie that doesn't take itself too seriously with a talented cast that more believably portrays high school students (unlike the main cast in the Original who all look too old to be in High School). A movie that stands well on it's own merits (indeed, if one has NEVER seen a Grease movie or production, I'd recommend they watch THIS, the superior, one first)",Grease 2
197,j_gardner3,Gee...I hope they restore this film too.,2,28 November 1999,"I'm sorry, but even TJ Hooker's Adrian Zmed couldn't save this sequel.  I went through half the movie thinking that this was a spoof of the original. Then came that wild and wacky motorcycle scene (notice that this is the only movie that Patricia Birch directs); and I sadly realized they were trying to be serious.  I did get a kick out of the fact that the opposing gang, having lost their ""wheels"" due to their gambling habits in the original Grease, were forced to use motorcycles in the second movie.  Being shamed by that putz character Carrington, I'd hate to see what they would resort to later: maybe Mopeds?I also never bought the hackneyed theme: hunky-Australian-boy-can't-fit-into-Outsiders-dominated-school-ergo-goes-for -tough-guy-with-stupid-biker-helmet-look. It was Disney story gone horribly awry.So, it looks like you CAN ruin a good thing by placing a bubble-gum smacking Michelle Pfeiffer in a musical.  The only thing I took away from this movie was an idea of how many points out of ten to give it.",Grease 2
198,taurus42287,I think that this movie was the best!,10,6 January 2000,"I liked Grease 2 better then Grease because I think that it was a lot funnier.  I also liked Maxwell Caulfield because I think that he is totally cute.  The minute I saw him in the movie, I knew that he would be my favorite actor in the whole world!  Anyway, I really liked this movie and I'll watch it over and over again for the rest of my life!",Grease 2
199,melani,AWESOME!,10,18 June 2000,"All I can say is what a film!  I first saw it when I was about 11! One christmas, my mum told me I would like it! At the time I didn't believe her but now I can't stop watching it! I went through a phase of watching it like 3 times a day and even now I can't get enough of it! I think Louis DiMucci (Peter Frechette) is so gorgeous in it, he's what makes it for me! Yeah, I admit the movies as cheesy as you like, but I can't help liking it!!",Grease 2
200,rilian-2,"Don't compare, just have fun!",7,11 March 2002,"This movie is not the original ""Grease"", so just get over it and enjoy it for what it actually is; a rollicking, colorful, sometimes cheesy yet very fun movie.  The songs are catchy and very entertaining, while the characters are amusing.  I was a non-believer until my girlfriend, who absolutely loves it, made me watch and I had a great time!  So lighten up and have some fun!",Grease 2
201,misterjunk,Entertaining,7,12 August 2006,"I liked watching this movie in my early teens and now my preteen children have just seen it for the first time (bought the DVD) and they thought it was great. The problem with this movie has always been the connection to Grease. The movie by itself is entertaining, it should have been given a different name though. This is probably one of those movies that many people like but are embarrassed to admit it!It is not to say Grease 2 doesn't get corny at times. A few of the songs are really lame. Most of the music while not epic is fun and memorable. There is more humor than the original and the theme of guys trying to get sex from girls keeps the movie flowing together. Who could forget the ""Let's do it for our country"" scene!",Grease 2
202,godgivenkid,wasn't that great.,4,19 November 2007,"Although the actors are better looking the movie wasn't all that good. The actors didn't have great voices either. The characters were awful. The actors are good actors and the movie was just a black spot on their careers. The plot was weak, it didn't really have a middle to the story. It didn't seem as if the writers of the movie knew what they were doing. It wasn't all that exciting. They could have made it a lot better. I only liked about one or two of the songs. I'm not saying it is the worst movie in the world because I have seen worse, it just could have been made a little better than it was. The first Grease was a whole lot better. You can't top it and they shouldn't have tried.",Grease 2
203,TasukiGirl,"Not too bad, but grease was better",6,25 April 2005,"Frankly I like the music and the acting isn't bad. I really am a big fan of Michelle Pheifer, so anything she is in she shines. Max Claudfield is cute but seems not so real. Didi Conn was great in the first movie and this one she was still a cutie, but not the same caliber as before. All of the other characters are well played. The movie's story is not so good but still is entertaining. The songs leave a sexual impression in most scenes but they are still fun hearted. I like this movie for the actors and the music. I do not like the story because it has nothing really to do with Grease one except for brief nuances of certain characters (i.e. Sandie, Her parents and Vince Fontaine).",Grease 2
204,jumpinggirl,This is an excellent movie,10,27 May 2006,"I don't know why Grease 2 has had all this bad reviews! I think it is one of the best movies of all times. It is high near the top of my favourites list and I think it is just as good, or if not even better than Grease. The cast was great and the songs were absolutely amazing. Well except for the ""charades"" song, but then it rates with ""sandy"" in Grease, which i must say is not my favourite song. Some people do not think that this movie is perfect, but please do not think of this movie as a sequel. It is quite separate from Grease, except the plot is slightly similar, but different in a way. I won't spoil it for you, and let you watch it a judge it for yourself. Overall this is a great movie and I recommend anyone to watch it!",Grease 2
205,joannemiles-39715,I LOVE this movie..,10,12 October 2019,"I'm not saying this is a cinematic masterpiece, and if you're the type of person who takes movies very seriously then this possibly isn't for you... but I absolutely LOVE this movie... I grew up watching it at least once per week and me and my sister still randomly song the songs now. It's one of the only movies that will put a huge smile on my face the whole way through, even if I've had a rubbish day... it brings back so many wonderful memories. I prefer it to the original Grease, not because it's a better story, but because it was more of my time growing up and the fact that the female lead is stronger character who knew what she wanted rather than someone trying to be something she's not, was a much stronger message for me as a young girl. You either love this movie or you hate it and I most certainly LOVE it.",Grease 2
206,mermaid28-1,loved grease 2,8,2 October 2006,"I was 14 years old when I saw this movie. I loved it. I really thought it was charming and liked the fact that it was a reversal role of the first movie. I felt that they did a great job with the costumes. The costumes were not 80's at all, the problem is that in the 80's anything that was worn in the 50's and 60's just happen to be in again. So of course to some people it seemed like instead of wearing 60's clothes they were wearing 80's.True Michelle's singing was not that great, but i think she gets a b for effort. The acting was pretty good considering most of the stars had never been seen acting before. I certainly don't feel this movie was a disaster. True it would never be an academy award winner, but it was still charming and many of those that say they don't like , its only because there too embarrassed to admit they liked it.",Grease 2
207,pushybaby2000,Cousin to the first Grease...very distant cousin,2,3 November 2001,"Let's be honest.  This is so bad, it's good.  The lens used on Lorna Luft is so fuzzy, it doesn't make her look younger, it makes her look out of focus. The songs are so sappy, you have to love them.  ""Charade,"" when you can see the previous heart outlines on the notebook as Max draws...""Score,"" with the choppy edit...these are just a couple of things that endear you to this movie.  You get the feeling that you and your buddies could have done better.  That's alone is worth the price of the rental.  Pardon me, now, it's time to ""Do It For Our Country.""",Grease 2
208,MrFire,love it,10,15 June 2007,"i'm sure that there are absolutely loads of people who would not touch this film in a million years-well in fact i know this from EX-girlfriends whom i could not convince to watch it(on many occasion it has been the last straw!), but if you start watching this film just accepting that it's going to be a bit naff then i think you can really enjoy it.""Grease"" is one of my all-time favourite films and to be honest I enjoy ""Grease 2"" just as much, in fact were they both of the tele at the same time i would probably watch the later and flick to the previous from time to time. Grease 2 is the ultimate Sunday lunchtime hangover film, with not too much going on, just some light-hearted singing and dancing with a few scuffles to keep your ears open if not your eyes.I think that Michelle Phiffier is excellent and plays the role in exactly the right spirit, with the diner scene being one of the bests. It does not try to be the first film the only real connection is Rydall High.Take no high ideals into this film, just take it as the light-hearted bit of silliness it is and enjoy it.",Grease 2
209,jordan2004,Better then the first,10,7 December 2001,"I believe that this movie was so much better then the first.  It had a better plot and it flowed better.  The only thing I could not get was that Frenchy was able to go back to school.  It seemed that it was taking place 10 years later then the first, but it was till a better movie.",Grease 2
210,kelly_starling,Never saw the first one!,8,10 April 2018,"As a 12 yr old girl who'd never seen Grease it was easy to fall in love with Michael Carrington and think Michelle Phiffer looked like an angel!! What's funny is I'm now a 47 yr old mother with 3 kids(22,19 & 16) who know Grease 2 line for line! It's hokey, kitschy and just the right amount of corny!",Grease 2
211,roseuy,terribly underrated film.,10,9 December 2002,"grease 2 is one of my favorite films. when i watched grease 2 back in 1982, i forgot what grease 1 was all about and maybe that's why i appreciated the movie more.  grease 2 had no chance of being appreciated because of everyone's high expectations. i have watched grease 2 over 20 times and i swear maxwell caulfield looks better every single time. give it a chance and watch it, be open to the experience and you've love it!",Grease 2
212,ShirtTales,This movie ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!,10,19 February 2002,"This movie is way better than the first Grease!!!!!  Michelle Pfeiffer is great in this movie!!!!  Her best!!!!  The original may be good, but it only gets better with this sequel!!! The rest of the cast are wonderful, too!!!! The story line is much more indepth than the first. It is all very creative and hilarious! A wonderful love story for the romantics out there!!!!",Grease 2
213,tensticks,Superior to the Original in EVERY WAY,10,7 July 2002,"Yes, I mean it; no, I'm not kidding....Grease 2 is an absolute classicit's languishing in obscurity next to its undeservedly famous predecessor is a great tragedyand it deserves stellar treatment on DVD",Grease 2
214,baileysbbe,Grease 2 shouldn't have been dismissed; it's the best film ever.,10,15 April 2009,"I found this an excellent film, i thought it contained great actors, great music and a wicked storyline. Although the first one is just a classic and John Travolta could not have been any better than he was i agree with people when they say that it was boring at times (watching it once is OK but when you love it that much and watch it over and over again then it will get a bit boring) so when i watch it now i skip a lot of parts. Anyway, we're talking about Grease 2 now!I give Grease (9/10) but i give Greae 2 (10/10), i'd give it more if i could. Every actor deserved their part and it was nice to see Blanche and Miss McGee (the dynamic duo) again in this film, Frenchy's appearance showed it as a follow on from Grease but it shouldn't be told as a sequel (although it's the best sequel ever), they should be treated as two separate films as they have different story lines and only a few of the same characters (i think it may not have been AS good without these characters). Grease 2 is a treat and i love it, although one main reason may be because the leading lady has my name but i also love the actors, the humour, the music and just the plain simplicity of it. Maxwell Caulfield (Michael), Adrian Zmed (Johnny) are gorgeous, Peter Frechette (Louis) is soooooo cute and Christopher McDonald (Goose) and Leif Green (Davey) are just plain hilarious. All the pink ladies make great pink ladies and the ending couldn't be more perfect; everyone has someone and it's so romantic. THIS FILM SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARDED!!!I even love Leo 'Craterface' Balmudo in this one, although he is the villain he is funny. (Although i don't get why he's the leader of the Scorpions in Grease and Cycle Lords in Grease 2!?)",Grease 2
215,moviebuff1981,Awesome,10,25 April 2008,"Jamie C. from Orlando here. I am still a huge fan of Grease 2. I used to emulate the dance moves with my friends. High school in a musical context is great. I like all the superlatives you can give the Grease 2 characters. I often times wish high school was more mature like the students there. I sometimes make up fun facts about the characters, like Michael Carrington would be most likely to star in a b list 90s movie, Stephanie Zinone would most likely get pregnant while still in high school, Johnny Nogerelli would end up being a swimsuit model, Louis DiMucci Balmudo would be most likely to end up working operating carnival rides, and Principal McGee  most likely to turn out to be a transvestite. Has anyone seen the posters of Adrian Zmed in a Speedo. Nice!",Grease 2
216,pbowers-6,A camp classic at its best,10,6 October 2008,"now i can understand all the bad comments about this film, the acting is bad, the editing and the continuity is awful, but for some reason i love it. its the one film that i know every single word off by heart.The songs may not have an all time classic like ""hopelessly devoted"" like grease 1, but the vast majority of the songs are pretty strong and memorable.It camp kitsch at its finest. and you'd be surprised just how many people out there love this film. on a certain social networking site, there thousands of us in appreciation groups, and they are a pretty mixed bunch (male - female - somewhere in between) not everyone it going to love this film, but its worth watching with an open mind!",Grease 2
217,lilrchmn328,Let's Do It For Our Country,8,25 March 2009,"As you could tell, this was a horrendous movie. For me, however, there was one redeeming quality that makes this one of the best movies i have ever seen. the song ""let's do it for our country"" was so fun and funny and great, and i watched just that scene over and over and over again. thats more than i can say for some of the movies that i absolutely loved!!! that one scene is so great and i strongly suggest watching it a couple hundred times.as for the rest of the movie, it was purely fun, and thats the best i can say for it. i hardly understood the songs, and i was sort of disappointed to see that the bad boys weren't all that bad, more just goofy Italians. i missed danny zucko!!! however, good looking actors rather made up for lack of talent.",Grease 2
218,NRChristianson,Grease 2=RAD. That is all.,10,10 April 2009,"I will just start this by saying that Grease 2 is one of my all time favorite movies ever made. Yes, it is cheesy, yes, most of it is a stretch of the imagination, but it's got heart, and personally, I find it a hundred times more romantic and fun then the original. I appreciate the original, because without it, the second one would never have gotten made, but other than that, I think the original is pretty bland and not 1/2 as funny or charming as the second. Grease 2 has such a fantastic cast, and although I have seen comments that the songs are ridiculous as well as the movie itself, I really can't understand where people are coming from on this. The songs are terrific and humorous as well as being extremely catchy! My heart melts a little every time I watch this movie, which is often. It has kept my interest and my loyalty for decades, and I feel a little bit sorry for people out there who don't have the same fondness for it. They are really missing out.",Grease 2
219,rosaky02,Forever Grease 2,10,12 August 2005,"It's already more than 20 years since I saw this movie, tho, this is still one of my BEST BEST movies. Yes, I have to admit that whole the story itself and dance scenes were lacking some great impact. Maybe I could say this is typical movie just for fun. But I can't forget this handsome man, Maxwell Caulfield EVER! I've never seen in my life more beautiful man than he is. Phiffer was also sooo cool&cute in this movie. Both were so fantastic that I still haven't found any better couples in any other movies. I can't understand why this movie couldn't break....""Grease"" was that better than this movie ? Anyway I vote as 10 because this is great movie. Why not?",Grease 2
220,trisha52187,one of the worst movies in history,2,29 June 2003,"This movie was terrible.  Grease is one of my top 3 favorite movies ever and i was very disappointed when i saw this.  It was beyond bad.  I did like a few of the songs like ""Reproduction"" but besides that it was just plain terrible.  Don't waste your time.
2/10",Grease 2
221,ripdeez_2000,Don't be afraid to admit you like it!,7,26 June 2020,"I've read so many reviews about this movie - Love It...Hate It - that it's hard to wrap my head around why such extremes.I guess there are those who loved the original Grease - I love both movies - and are loyal to the original.Much like those who prefer the earlier Star Wars films, but detest the prequels that were released 20 years after the originals and 20 years before the final chapters.I think a lot has to do the age when we all saw those movies. I was too young to remember the original Grease - yes, my older sister played the record constantly, but I saw the sequel as a 9-year old and bought the cassette that I played nonstop that summer of '82.You don't have to afraid to admit that you enjoy the sequel. I agree w/ other reviewers here that it's its own separate movie. They CAN stand alone.Yes, there are some carry-over cast from the original, but really just some dancers and faculty (well, I guess Eugene and Craterface return).Overall, yes, this story doesn't hold up well almost 40 years later, but how much have you and I changed during those years. I'm sure if you show this movie to the younger generation now and don't tell them that it's a ""sequel"" to the original, then they'll appreciate it for what it really is - good, (sort of) clean fun!",Grease 2
222,startrekfangirl,Better than the first,7,30 June 2006,"I love grease 2 it is better than the first. the characters are hotter mainly Michael and better songs. Grease 2 is about Sandys cousin Michael who's the new kid with new T-birds (johnny,Goose,Louis,and Davey). also they are new Pink Ladies (Stephanie Paulette Sharon Rhonda). when Michael first meets Stephine the leader of the Pink ladies he falls in love with her. when Michael hears Stephine wants her dream guy to be a motorcycle king he starts doing the T-birds homework to earn money to get a motorcycle. when Michael finally gets a motorcycle he quickly becomes excellent on it. Michael rides to the bowling alley on his motorcycle to impress Stephanie. when he gets there he run into the scorpions the T-birds rival gang. because of his helmet and giant motorcycle goggles people don't recognize him including Stephanie. so he becomes known as the mysterious rider. as the mysterious rider Michael wins Stephanie heart. at the end of the movie Michael revels himself to everybody Stephanie still loves him and Michael gets to be a T-birds. includes good songs and great couples I recommend this movie to everybody. I give it 10 out of 10 stars.",Grease 2
223,mizzkarajina,pure fun.,10,21 January 2004,"When I get depressed, i throw Grease 2 into the VCR, and laugh it up. Michele Pfieffer is awesome in this movie. she has no much energy, and she looks damn good in a pink ladies jacket. Every song in the entire movie is so much fun, except the one that michael sings in the cafeteria and the one in biker heavan, but even those are really corny and funny. I get these songs stuck in my head all the time. Tad Hunter (the substitute teacher) has a small part, and leads the song ""reproduction"". In fact, I love these songs so much, that i want to cover them with my band. i could almost compare this movie to Cry Baby, only it doesn't have the raunch of John Waters. nonetheless, Grease 2, I find, is more entertaining that the original, and the mass choreography is much more impressive, Grease was more centered around the few key character's dancing, as Grease 2 had dozens of people involved, which is more difficult to orchestrate. GO RENT IT!! NOW!!!!!",Grease 2
224,nfmorse,Hit N Miss,1,10 February 2012,"this is a sad attempt to capitalize on the original's success. almost EVERY scene with Michelle Pfeiffer is not era appropriate clothing or hair n make-up for the times. You could 'plunk' her, (and her character) out of this movie and insert her into St Elmo's Fire or The Breakfast Club and have everything current with the fashion of the time. did she insist on only doing this movie if she could appear in a manner as she wouldn't be embarrassed? i was Born in the 60's and she does NOT represent the 60's by a LONG shot. i did not ONCE see era appropriate hair one her.. where was the structure curl of 'roller setting' on her? and the Sad portrayal of every one of the main characters as IDIOTS. the making of this movie should NEVER have been associated with the first Grease and should have been made as more of a parody for the times, but not be linked with the first Grease. the characters of the first were NOT so shallow and stupid as these people were who were supposed to be following in the footsteps of COOL people.",Grease 2
225,hailee-rebecca,Not very well made.,4,8 October 2012,"If you watched the original ""Grease"" then this will most likely be a disappointment. I liked the idea - the tough chick falling for the sweet guy, but I think it could have been produced much better. The music wasn't all that great, neither with the dance sequences. I knew before I turned it on that it would not be able to the exact standards ""Grease"" did but I didn't expect to be this much of a disappointment. Stick to watching the classic. Though, I'll admit, the movie wasn't totally bogus. I really enjoyed Micheal's character and I liked seeing Frenchy again - she was my favourite character from the original. I thought it was weird that the 'Pink Ladies' were now owned by the T-Birds; they couldn't date outside the group because they were the T-Birds girls. That just didn't match up to me. The 'Reproduction' scene was kind of cool, I suppose.",Grease 2

I hadn't seen Grease in years so that was the last thing on my mind while watching it. I enjoyed it. It wasn't necessarily bad just boring. The things I did like about it was the song Cool Rider and the character of Michael was generally likable. One complaint I do have is during one of his songs it is so obvious he doesn't sing it. If I didn't watch Grease right after this what have gotten 6 stars. However I did. I was laughing all through the movie and singing along and that is a movie that holds up over years. Grease 2 just didn't capture the spirit of the first Grease. Grease 2 was raunchy and not in a good way. In Grease the dirty jokes were clever and they were just kind of there in Grease 2. The characters in Grease 2 weren't memorable either. All in all, don't bother with Grease 2 if you can watch Grease.",Grease 2

Briefly, i just want to say that it's really scandalous that this movie is in the top 100 of the worst movies ever. I really can't understand it. I can immediately come up with 500 movies that are way worse than grease 2. I think the greatest problem is that most of the people want to compare this movie with the first one.

Micheal is god and must b worshiped for his kill kill kill kill them all coolness. he is a leg end and makes all over leathers quite appealing. stephanie is the epitome of cool in leggins and sexy fluffy hair. ""she ain't noones trophy"" though! The songs in the film can only b described as genius. personal favourites include... cool rider, who's that guy, score tonight and girl for all seasons. also the end song. if you don't kill kill kill kill them all watch this film i will hunt you down so sleep with one eye open and the TV on!

The songs are excellent and catchy (they'll be in your head for the next week after watching it), and the corny over-acting even beats that of the cast in the original grease; which was super! How can you go past a musical with Michelle pfieffer any how? she's so hot! Michelle on the ladder strutting her stuff whilst singing ""cool rider"" is such a wonderful scene... i just cant see how you guys can diss the movie, it's so excellent, i really cant say anything bad about it, it even beats rocky horror for me... which is huge!",Grease 2

I think this movie tried too hard to be like the original, following the same basic story line but this time the guy changing for the girl.also I don't think the actors portrayed the 'T-birds' and 'Pink ladies' very well.The new characters were clones of the original ones, similar personalities, hairstyles and even similar names. The songs were the worst part, they were bland and boring they didn't pump me up like 'grease lighting' or 'summer nights' would.

The only problem is, they should not have named it Grease 2, they could have named it something else. It didn't have any of the same actors/actresses & the story was different other then the school. The music in Grease 2 is much more superior then the first one. However, I do like these songs from Grease: Summer Nights, Sandy & We Go Together. Anybody that says Grease 2 movie & music was & is no good, knows nothing about music or movies. I am really surprised that Maxwell Caulfield didn't succeed in movies. He is an excellent Actor & very good looking. It is unfortunate that mainly Michelle Pfeiffer was the only one from Grease 2 to really succeed.",Grease 2

I can always remember my mam putting this song on and my dog went wild howling at a song called cool rider. Michelle Pfeiffer who plays Stephanie Zinone sing the song as she trying to tell Maxwell Caulfield who plays Michael Carrington what she wants in a guy.Then in 2009 I took really bad with pancreatitis (gallstones) which was 5 years yesterday when I ended up in hospital. I also ended up on a life support machine when I came around on life support I can always remember my sister bringing grease 2 in and when cool rider come on I was bobbing away to it even though I was really ill with pancreatitis (gallstones) out of all the songs in grease 2 cool rider is my favourite just as bring lots of good and bad memories I can't explain why.,Grease 2
234,Leppi_04,One Great Sequel!,9,10 April 2005,"This movie is definitely one of the best sequels that I have ever seen! From start to finish it is packed with songs that will get stuck in your head and make you want to get up and start dancing. It is a true musical and definite credit to it's ""father-movie"", Grease. The story follows the same Grease plot, but with a little twist that's a nice change. All of the actors/actresses are magnificent, very believable. There is also that truth to the era/decade that the movie takes place. It is captured very well. If you loved the first movie, you will love the second. And I highly recommend to anyone that if you have seen Grease, go Grease 2! You'll be a fan from the second the movie starts.",Grease 2
235,creativeartist,Grease 2,8,14 April 2005,"I watched Grease 2 recently and thought it was fantastic but of course not as good as the original. However I noticed that in a lot of scenes the setting and clothes of the olden days yet Michelle Peeifeer was in modern clothing and even modern sunglasses, I thought what was going on. To be she seemed out of place and I thought that Maxwell Caulfield and Adrian Zmed were fantastic as with the other cast, yet I thought the movie may have been more of a hit with a different leading lady. I loved the dancing and thought all the actors, except for Stephanie played by Michelle Pfeiffer, were convincing in their roles and gave great performances. The set details were well done and really effective. I think I would have liked more songs in the movie too.",Grease 2
236,spootcookie,My favorite kitsch,8,24 April 2005,"Okay, this movie is absolutely ridiculous, and if I was only rating its surface quality, my score would be much lower. The plot and dialogue are fraught with silliness, and if you watch carefully there are numerous little mistakes that should have been edited out. (Spoiler: Michael's motorcycle right out in plain view of Steff, with him leaning on it, when he's hiding his ""cool rider"" identity from her.) Some of the songs are especially painful, particularly in the ultra-serious motorcycle heaven scene, and the choreography is just bad. Watching Michelle Pfeiffer dance and sing ""Cool Rider"" is terrible--she should not be dancing that way, or singing at all. One has to wonder why Crater Face was included as a ""villain"" in this film, because now his tormenting of the high school students is just sad. Then again, I have a soft spot for Grease 2 that I don't have for the too oft-shown first film. For one, just to get this out of the way, Maxwell Caulfield is gorgeous in this movie. If you hate the film, you can always (assuming you swing that way) just watch him. It's not as if his acting is bad, and neither is Michelle's, though her lines are. And Grease 2 is funny, in its own way--you simply can't watch Michelle dance and sing without laughing. There is a lot to laugh at--and even with--in this musical. ""Reproduction"" is fun to watch, if certainly campy, and a couple of the T-birds are entertaining (Leif Green and Peter Frechette's characters).As I said, I have a fondness for this movie that is pretty inexplicable, I know. It's not a classic film by any means. Still, I'd say if you're looking for a so-bad-it's-good that still isn't too incredibly awful, to laugh at with your friends, Grease 2 is worth a rental.",Grease 2
237,Karen_vinter,Strong contender for worst sequel ever made,2,7 October 2005,"Grease was a great musical for three reasons. One, the cast could sing. Two, the songs were memorable. Three, the choreography was great (Born to Hand Jive, anyone?). Unfortunately, when making Grease 2 no-one seemed to think that these elements were particularly important.I never normally feel compelled to write comments on here about the films I have seen. However, just having sat through the monstrosity that is Grease 2 I simply had to act. From start to pathetic end, this musical is terrible. It's meant to be set in 1961, but a lot of the songs (""Cool Rider"" especially) seem to have been influenced by 1970s guitar rock like Meatloaf, so they seem completely out of place. The singing is appalling - why did no-one think to cast actors who could sing? Or just dub them with singers who could?! The music is even badly edited - take for instance ""Charade"", where you can't make out a single lyric thanks to terrible diction combined with a vocal laid far too quiet on the mix. Most of the songs are multi-tracked for some strange reason too - so those weak voices come at you 4-strong at a time, making the overall sound very 80s. Some songs seem horribly out of place...why sing a really chirpy song when Michael (aka the Cool Rider) is presumed dead, then finish with a slow ballad for the finale when it's discovered he's alive and his identity is revealed?! Rama- dama-ding-a-long it ain't.As for the choreography - look at the song set in the bowling alley if you don't get what I'm talking about. It's supposed to be a big set number, so why is the dancing so unimaginative? Most of it just involves twirling around (a lot!) and throwing the suddenly miraculously light bowling balls!As for the cast, they all look incredibly old - the leader of the rival gang (also in the first film - forgive me not knowing the character's name but he's the one who dates Cha Cha) could easily pass for 45. Pfeiffer, here in an early role, is grumpy and petulant for most of the film, leaving you to wonder why Michael goes to all the bother of wooing her in the first place. Her singing is dreadful, her face inexpressive, and she gets the frumpiest outfits of all the Pink Ladies.Finally, numerous plot points are unexplained: Why are the T-birds, so cool in the first film, now bothered about a stupid talent contest? Why do they all now ride bikes instead of cool cars? What happens to Frenchie - she just disappears halfway through the film?! Why is Sandy's cousin Michael English, when she is Australian? What happened to the end of year funfair in the first Grease film...we now get a cheap Lu-ow (sic) instead...run out of budget did we?I suppose if you want to have a quick look, it has a certain""It's so bad it's good"" quality, which is why I suppose some people have voted this film a ten, but in reality it's painful to sit through it all. Fans of Grease would be better off imagining and writing a Grease 2 of their own - frankly a trained monkey couldn't do worse.",Grease 2
238,amazongirl24,A pink lady is tired of t-bird and wants to fall in love with a cool guy.,2,24 September 2005,"There's a cute actor called Maxwell Caulfield. This movie is so much bad than what I thought. I mean I wanted to watch this because I thought it would be involved with the characters and the actors, that was proved incorrect. This movie just had the setting,the costumes,and music right, I think. Although sometimes I wondered if the costumes did correspond with the time period. But I felt this movie was just so cheesy,so much full of fluff. *spoiler* When they all have their own pair at the ends the pink ladies and the t- birds they sing this dumb song, which I thought they should have done an upbeat song. I mean some songs will get stuck in your head. The movie is okay.",Grease 2
239,mdmattinson-44805,Who said sequels can't measure up to the first one?,10,25 September 2019,"I like it better than the first. I have a degree in piano performance and have played for a lot of musicals- amateur
and professional. This musical will withstand the test of time!",Grease 2
240,myr4in_17,Didn't beat the original,6,31 August 2005,"I thought Grease 2 was going to be another huge hit, like the original But sadly, I was disappointed by how the film went.There were a new group of T-Birds and Pink Ladies in Rydell High. Michelle Pfeiffer played as Stephanie Zinone, leader of the Pink Ladies, who thinks that she no longer has interest in Johnny Nogerelli (Adrian Zmed). Then there comes Michael Carrington (Maxwell Caulfield), the cousin of Sandy, who fancies Stephanie in some way. He'll try to make her notice him by being ""cool"" even if he's got the brains in the class.I was surprised by Frenchy (played by Didi Conn) She was rarely seen on the movie. She did very well in the first Grease movie. She deserves more lines than that.The songs were not as great as the ones from the original. Tough there are some parts of it were not really that bad.It didn't really beat Grease 1 but it's not that much bad. They should work more on the plot.All in all, I give it: 6/10",Grease 2
241,deonemba,One of my Favorite coming of age stories of all times.,10,12 March 2021,"This movie is wonderful, nostalgic and fun. It's not Grease which was heavily influenced or set in the 50s. The movie exist in the Grease Universe but it's more 80s than 50s. Michael ready to excel academically at a new school in a new country became smitten by the cool hot girl.",Grease 2
242,sassyasswoman,I really enjoyed it,8,30 September 2005,"I feel that Grease 2, while it is not of the same caliber as the original, Grease, is still a good movie. There were mistakes, I will agree, but overall, it was good. Michele Pfeiffer is an excellent actress and no one else could have played Stephanie Zinone.. Maxwell Caulfield played Michael Carrington as well as he could considering he was given little to work with. I have a collection of ""bad"" movies and this one is definitely NOT in that group. I won't say that this is one of the best movies/musicals I have ever seen but it is a far cry from the worst. Some of the songs were more than cheesy but overall it got the point across... A person also has to take into consideration that this was the first major role for several of the actors. For anyone expecting it to be a ""remake"" of Grease, it is a ""disappointment, but for someone to be expecting fresh new faces and funny punch lines, this is great.",Grease 2
243,pandamaniac,"I don't know about everybody else, but GREASE 2 rocks!!!!",10,16 October 2005,"I don't know why people have a cow over sequels. Sure they are not always great or even good, but to just toss aside a perfectly good movie because it didn't contain the original characters is a bit over the top. What do people expect, John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John to play high school sweethearts in their 30s? I think not. The director, writers, and producers gave enough background information in the beginning of the movie to orient new watchers that if you hadn't seen Grease (which I love) you weren't completely lost. They included the T-Birds, Pink Ladies, the principals, and even ""Crater Face""-you have to give them credit for putting together an excellent sequel. People who thought that Grease 2 sucked, I respect your opinions, I just totally disagree with some of the reasoning posted on this site for saying it sucked.",Grease 2
244,pajamas_132,i love this movie!,10,20 October 2005,"I love this movie! It is my second favorite to phantom of the opera. Maxwell Caulfield is the hottest man I have ever seen! He's 23 in that movie. Now he's old and stuff. :( I want a time machine to go back in time and marry him when he's young. I love his accent! He gives me goosebumps just thinking about him (no lie)! I like the storyline of this movie better than the original grease but the musical part was not as good. Maxwell Caulfield rocks! I'm literally obsessed! I wish I was born earlier. :( I'm only 14 now. I can't stop thinking about him. He's the hottest man alive (in the '80s). If I were smart I would so build a time machine and go back to the '80s to marry Maxwell Caulfield. If this movie didn't have him in it, I wouldn't like it nearly as much. Thank God they picked him! I wish he were younger! He's my new love! lol I'm in love with a 47 yr old man! lol i wish I could make him younger! He was so hot when he was 23! Why does he have to be old now?! My favorite line was when he said,""Actually, I think you're kinda terrific."" AWWWWW I wish a guy would say that to me! Oh well.",Grease 2
245,anirmato,Excellent movie,10,23 June 2017,Loved this movie.. My whole family watched Grease 1 and 2 when we were growing up. Can't believe the backlash on Grease 2. It's hilarious and we loved it and know all the words to songs. We still watch it till this very day!! We also perform some of the songs at family gatherings..,Grease 2
246,Dark_Sinus,This is not a followup on Grease...It's it's own movie,8,31 October 2008,"I've read many of the comments here now, some pleasing me, some making me angry and sad...A big mistake most people do when watching this movie is as many here have said, comparing it to Grease. I wouldn't think to much of it as Grease 2, but as it's own movie by itself.Spoiler warning again!!!Michael Carrington, a hard working top student from england begins at Rydel High were he meets Stephanie Zenoni, a Pink Lady. Sick of the T-Birds Bizarre rules and being someones ""chick"" all the time, she wants a ""Cool Rider"" but she doesn't realize how close this Mr. Right is. Michael almost immediately fall in love with her not realizing the problem this cold cost with the T-Birds. To win her heart he soon realizes that he has to get a bike and become the ""Cool Rider""; Stephanie mentioned to get her full attention. But later on reviling who he really is appears to be harder then expected and in the end...well I'm not going to spoil the end...You' just have to watch it.Seeing Michelle Pfeffer in this movie is the bast part of this movie for me...seeing her as Stephanie with both good acting skills and a good singing-voice, the rest of the plot is also great and we have Didi Conn back as Frenchy...and we see old characters from the first on as Miss McGee, Blanche, Coatch Callhoum and the nerd Eugine.But the main advise I have for those who are going to watch this movie...please don't compare i with Grease 1, see it as a complete new movie...it is so much better that way...! I wouldn't look at it to much as a musical either...more like a movie with some nice music and funny songs : )",Grease 2
247,shenelldale,i got post traumatic stress disorder from watching this movie,1,24 October 2017,"this reminded me of high school musical. everything is corny and cheap and I'm not getting my 2 hours of life back. this movie got rid of my will to live. for everyone who says they liked the movie deserves to dig a hole in the ground and shoot themselves in the head whilst in the pre-dug hole with their copy of grease 2 so they can be buried forever with it. this movie was garbage, not because I'm comparing it to the original, but because it was just so cringy and internally damaging.",Grease 2

It's one of our favorite movies as kids. I just watched it again and it still makes me happy. Honestly, I've never seen Grease so I have nothing to compare it to. I guess I don't wanna mess up my love for Grease 2. I suppose I'll finally watch it some day.",Grease 2
249,tanya-108,an all time favorite.,10,7 January 2006,This movie came out when i was a kid and i loved it. the music is great. i wore out two VHS copy's of it watching it over and over.it is something you can watch with your kids and have fun with the songs. it has a nice story line and is very up beat.it will always be one of my favorite. if you liked grease one you need to give grease two a try.i think Michell Pfeiffer did a great job with the songs and the dances in the movie. not to mention the entire cast does a great job with the songs and dances in the movie. And for anyone that loves a love story this is a good one to watch. this will always be one of the best movie memory's from my childhood. it made me believe in true love.,Grease 2
250,laf1128,So bad that it's good!,7,20 January 2006,"In my opinion, this movie shouldn't be rated on it's merits as a film. It's simply god-awful - but that being said, you cannot tear yourself away! The songs themselves are ridiculous, the performances of them even more so but the kitsch value cannot be underestimated. Laugh as Michelle Pfeiffer spins across campus like a deranged duck at the end of ""Cool Rider"". Chortle as Maxwell Caufield (in an absolutely horrendous sweater) desperately tries to carry a tune. Giggle at all of the players as they attempt to make a serious go of it! That this is a bad movie & doesn't live up to the original goes without saying. But there is definite entertainment value to be gotten from this disaster and you shouldn't discount that. Tonight...we bowl!",Grease 2

It may not be the best film and certainly not as good as the first but I would still like to own it along with the first. Johnny nogereli and Michael Carrington were both soooo cute!!! It made me want to be a pink lady and meet a coool rider. I also like the way they brought back some of the characters from the first one like Eugene. He was the first and best nerd still.I search for these two movies every time I hit the stores and I will buy them up quick when I find them. KUDOS to the grease 2 writers and cast. After all how can you not love a show that introduced us to the great Michelle Pheifer. Thumbs up grease 2!!!!!!",Grease 2
