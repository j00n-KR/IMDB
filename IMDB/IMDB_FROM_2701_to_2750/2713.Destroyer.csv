0,Leofwine_draca,Meandering,4,24 August 2021,"Not quite sure what this film wants to be but it does feel a bit confused. A personal drama about a cop battling her personal demons with a bit of bank heist thriller added to the mix. The narrative is unconventional and also quite boring at times and the character work is limited despite decent actors in the cast. Nicole Kidman fails to impress here, hidden behind a brunette wig and they've smeared some black stuff around her eyes to ugly her up, but it just looks like what it is. Some scenes should never have been included. The heist itself is pretty good and there are some powerful moments, but it's too meandering to work.",Destroyer
1,SnoopyStyle,makeup a little distracting,7,3 May 2019,"The LAPD finds a dead body. Detective Erin Bell (Nicole Kidman) has the same tattoo as the victim. Immediately, she knows that Silas is back. In flashbacks, she and her partner Chris go undercover to infiltrate a robbery gang some years earlier. In the present, she is tracking down Silas and having difficulties with her rebellious daughter.I didn't recognize Kidman initially. Her new look is a little distracting even as her younger self. It's a mask which I have fight through to get to the character. I'd rather she do a no makeup look as her younger undercover cop and have some aging with a scar to denote the rough times. Why can't Kidman just look like Kidman? There is also a confused time setting. I understand the jumbo time line concept but this needs a little bit more jumbo to make it work. It needs to find an incident to concentrate on and the walk in the snow seems to be the emotional climax. It needs to sprinkle that incident over the whole movie. The big climax needs more explanation. There is no tension with her simply shooting the guy. Despite all the little problems, Kidman's performance and the devastated character is memorable and compelling. It's certainly not bland.",Destroyer
2,nogodnomasters,He's back.,4,20 February 2019,"Erin Bell (Nicole Kidman) is an undercover LA cop. The story loops back on itself and runs with a flashback subplot. As a youth Bell was involved in an undercover bank robbery gone bad. We find out the details over time. She has a drinking problem and is obsessed with finding Silas, the leader of the gang who has resurfaced 17 years later. Bell will never win mother-of-the-year and part of the story deals with her broken relationship with her daughter.Kidman does a good job in the film as a young blue-eyed beauty and a rode hard brown-eyed adult. The film is a crime drama, that is waiting for something to happen. Edited in a way I found more confusing than entertaining.Guide: F-word. No nudity.",Destroyer
3,kosmasp,Back (for good?),9,17 May 2019,"Sometimes self destruction is as crazy as destroying other things. So what is the title hinting at? And what is the movie trying to tell us? A good story one could argue, with cause and effect and some clever play on going back and forth to tell a story. And it works more than nicely, which is something you will be able to appreciate in hindsight.Even if it may feel as ""too clever"" at some point, this really is gripping. And the length Nicole Kidman went to portray that broken character ... actors in general can be described as vain, so having this look is something you have to really embrace. Not to mention scenes, where she has to do something you might call despicable (even if it is to characters that we are supposed to hate - still the things feel wrong - no pun intended).If you are able to get through it (it is a tough watch), you may be able to see and ""enjoy"" this for what it is.",Destroyer
4,classicsoncall,"""You can be better than me.""",7,30 September 2019,"Kudos to Nicole Kidman for putting herself out there in a role that transforms her character into what looks as zombie-like as a heroin addict. In fact, I thought Erin Bell (Kidman) was strung out for real until it was revealed she was actually working as an undercover LAPD cop. That was the first test of credibility for this story, as it seemed like she was going rogue in order to solve a present day murder that had echoes in the past. I can't fathom an undercover cop with such unrestricted conduct that ignores staying in contact with a partner or failing to report to authorities. So that didn't pass the smell test for me.But after a while we learn that Erin Bell is virtually as despicable as the thug she's trying to track down, and not only that, but having turned her partner from the past into an accomplice in an armed robbery. All the while dealing with an incorrigible teenage daughter who deserved a few well placed cracks upside the head. No mother/daughter bonding here, while the entire question of Bell's relationship with Ethan (Scoot McNairy) is left an open question mark. Presumably they were a couple at some point, but how and why after the death of Bell's former partner Chris (Sebastian Stan) is never explained, so that disconnect casts a question mark over the story as well.Catch the film for a totally different side of Nicole Kidman, but leave your thinking cap at the door for much of what you see on screen. Revenge and mayhem without impunity seems to thrive in pictures like this, and this one has more than it's share. The resolution does nothing to make you feel better about what you just experienced, leaving one as disconnected as Kidman's character.",Destroyer
5,jboothmillard,Destroyer,6,17 February 2019,"I saw the trailer for this film a couple of times, I was expecting it to be a slightly big deal, but it only played in one cinema I could get to, I wondered if it was worth it, but film critic Mark Kermode convinced me to go for it, directed by Karyn Kusama (Æon Flux, Jennifer's Body). Basically LAPD detective Erin Bell (Golden Globe nominated Nicole Kidman) arrives at the scene of a murder, both the victim and the assailant cannot be identified, but Erin recognises tattoos on the back of the victim's neck, she informs the responding officers she knows who the killer is. At her police station, Erin receives a $100 bill stained with purple dye in an unmarked envelope. Using a contact at the FBI, she confirms that the bill is from a bank robbery committed by a California gang many years ago that she and her former partner Chris (Sebastian Stan) were involved in as undercover officers. She tells her superiors that she believes the bill and the John Doe murder to be proof that the gang's leader Silas (Toby Kebbell) is back. Erin is forced to work her way through the remaining members of the gang in order to find Silas. She begins with Toby (James Jordan), who was incarcerated, but has been given compassionate release as he is dying, he is living with his mother. Toby asks Erin to manually stimulate him in exchange for the location of Arturo (Zach Villa), a member of the gang who attempts to make amends for his past crimes by offering pro bono legal services to immigrants. Arturo provides Erin with the location of Dennis DiFranco (Get Out's Bradley Whitford), a lawyer who launders the money from the original robbery. Erin deduces that Silas is active again because the money from the heist is almost gone. After threatening him, DiFranco gives Erin the location of the next money hand-off, which is performed by Silas' girlfriend Petra (Tatiana Maslany). Erin tracks Petra and intervenes in a bank robbery committed by Silas' new gang, she kidnaps Petra. In flashbacks, it turns out Erin and Chris developed a romantic relationship while undercover, Erin got pregnant with his child. At Erin's behest, they decided to become legitimate participants in the bank robbery and planned to take their shares of the heist, report to their superiors that they lost contact with the gang, and eventually quit the force. The robbery was botched when a dye pack exploded in one of the bags, and Silas killed the bank teller who placed it. When Chris attempted to intervene, he was shot and killed by Silas, while Erin hid her share of the heist and returned to policing, disclosing neither her original plan or her share of the heist. In the present, throughout Erin has also been trying to make amends with her daughter Shelby (Jade Pettyjohn), who rejects her, but eventually they do have a meaningful conversation, and Erin apologises for being a bad mother. Erin visits a self-storage unit to retrieve her share of the stolen money but finds that most of it is stained with dye, she takes out any bills she can without staining. She receives a text message instructing her to meet at the Sixth Street Viaduct, she realises it is Silas, so she confronts him and shoots him, avenging Chris. She returns the next morning to find the police investigating the crime scene: the John Doe murder investigation seen at the beginning. With Silas dead, Erin gives evidence of her guilt, including Petra's location, the stained bill, and the key to her storage unit to her partner Antonio. It is revealed that Erin has been bleeding internally from the injuries she sustained through her investigation, and she dies while sitting in her car looking up at the sky. Also starring Scoot McNairy as Ethan, Toby Huss as Gil Lawson, Beau Knapp as Jay, Natalia Cordova-Buckley as Detective Gavras, Colby French as Detective Kudra and Kelvin Han Yee as Lieutenant Oshima. Kidman is almost recognisable as the physically ravaged cop who is fearless and determined to catch the killer and have her vengeance, it is essentially a flawed cop story, it has a great script and thrilling action when it needs it, I wonder if it is a little overrated by critics, but it is a most watchable crime drama. Good!",Destroyer

7,searchanddestroy-1,Search and destroy,10,27 February 2019,"I love this movie, so dark, bleak, depressing and totally hopeless. Nicole Kidman gives here her best performance ever. Her character is worth watching and usually held by men. This true film noir is not for all audiences, and also a sometimes ankward about directing and editing. There are some lengths that can put some discomfort of the whole film structure. It sometimes hesitates between action movie and film d'auteur but Nicole Kidman can easily justify to go and see it.",Destroyer
8,ferguson-6,Nicole sans glamour,6,9 January 2019,"Greetings again from the darkness. The rogue/burned-out cop obsessed with an old case or particular criminal nemesis is something we have seen many times before. Ordinarily there would be no reason to seek out yet another movie on the subject; however, this time the reason is obvious ... Nicole Kidman.Ms. Kidman, an Oscar winner for THE HOURS (2002), is an excellent actress and has had a wonderful career, but this is something altogether different for her. She plays LAPD Detective Erin Bell, a worn-down, emotionally shattered shell of the idealistic cop who, 17 years earlier, was part of an undercover operation that went tragically and violently wrong. Director Karyn Kusama (JENNIFER'S BODY, 2009) bounces back and forth on the timelines - sometimes we are viewing Erin's undercover work with her partner Chris (Sebastian Stan), and others we get the haggard Erin of present day. The contrast is stark.The ghost of case past has returned, and we witness what has haunted her these many years. Past decisions and actions have rotted her spirit, while alcohol has since destroyed her body. She is a wreck - physically and emotionally, and her reputation within the force is shot. It wouldn't be totally accurate to describe her as self-destructive since she has already destructed. The only thing keeping her going is booze and a desire for revenge.Flashbacks take us through her early work with the crime gang led by Silas (Toby Kebbell), a master of psychological manipulation (think Charles Manson). We also see Erin's too-close connection to partner Chris, and a terrific bank heist scene explains how things went down. Now it's 17 years later, and Silas has resurfaced. Erin wonders why. We also see Erin's feeble attempts to be a mother to her 16 year old daughter (do the math) Shelby, played by Jade Pettyjohn. The two have only a sliver of a relationship as Shelby lives with Erin's ex Ethan (the eternally underutilized Scoot McNairy).Other support work is provided by Tatiana Maslany as one of Silas' gang, and Bradley Whitford as a scummy defense attorney. Erin has a sequence with the latter that emphasizes just how alone she is. When asked where her partner is, we realize she has no partner with her and no back-up on the way ... she is a lonely, desperate, rogue cop with a murky plan and a head clouded by booze.Writing partners Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi (known for CLASH OF THE TITANS and RIDE ALONG) deliver very few surprises with the script, leaving the burden on Ms. Kidman to keep us interested. And despite her character's train wreck of a life, the performance is quite something to behold ... her look, her gait, and even her whispered voice - all point to a woman hanging on by a thread and lacking basic daily energy to show any signs of hope. Director Kusama adds texture by showing many non-touristy areas of Los Angeles, and filming the two timelines in such a way that the structure works - although the Erin in shambles is far more intriguing than the younger one. On a separate note, there should be a special Oscar for the make-up team that managed to make the usually glamorous Ms. Kidman look realistically shattered.",Destroyer
9,gradyharp,'There's nothing to lose when you've already lost everything',7,29 April 2019,"Director Karyn Kusama (AEon Flux, Girlfight, The Invitation) has created a film that may be difficult to watch because of the manner of relating the story by Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi, but the overall atmosphere and scenic moods captured make the impact of the film significant.As a young cop LAPD detective Erin Bell (Nicole Kidman) was placed undercover with fellow detective Chris (Sebastian Stan) with a bank robbery gang lead by Silas (Toby Kebbell) in the California desert with tragic results. When the leader of that gang re-emerges many years later, she must work her way back through the remaining members and into her own history - her daughter Shelby (Jade Pettyjohn) by Chris, her ruined marriage to Ethan (Scott McNary) to finally reckon with the demons that destroyed her past. Impressive performances by 'gang members' Tatiana Maslany, Beau Knapp, and Zach Villa et al enhance the grit of the story. To share more about he plot would be a spoiler, robbing the new viewer of the surprises of the ending.Nicole Kidman adds another dimension to her acting talent with an unflatteringly old face and body Erin, but the character she inhabits becomes a bit monochromatic. The camera work by Julie Kirkwood is dazzling and the musical score by Theodore Shapiro captures every facet of the moods of the film. All of the ingredients are fine - the pacing is sluggish and at times confusing - and simply for a new style of cinema the film is worth seeing.",Destroyer
10,blanbrn,"Raw and gritty uncommon and dirty performance from Nicole Kidman, proves the past is often haunting.",9,12 September 2019,"I must say that the cop drama ""Destroyer"" is one of the better movies and top notch works that I've seen from the wonderful Nicole Kidman in years. Nicole is Erin Bell a burned out and plain Jane weathered looking undercover LAPD drug detective who appears on her last leg. It's only when a case turns up it seems to have some past connection to her years ago undercover work thru L.A. and the California landscape which brought tragic results. And Erin has plenty on her plate from a rebel like teenage daughter to problems in the department with higher ups that involve case work power struggles.And while Erin who's self destructive it's her memories and flashbacks while working on a current case that haunts her the most as the images are painful as her tragic undercover work has damaged her so much now. All while fighting this new crime wave Erin faces her demons in a bold raw tough kick butt kind of way, as this drama is a very personal look at a damaged character who needs new hope and redemption. Overall tough underrated drama that's not pretty and Nicole's tough performance is to die for.",Destroyer
11,sddavis63,A Bold Title For A Muddled Story,3,1 November 2019,"Nicole Kidman was ... OK. She was all right as LAPD Detective Erin Bell, and the makeup people have to be given special credit because Kidman is hardly recognizable in the ""present"" scenes (she's more recognizable in the flashback scenes.) Bell is a traumatized cop - traumatized by an incident 20 years ago when she and a partner were undercover, infiltrating a gang, and the whole operation went tragically wrong. In the present Bell's a run down, worn out looking alcoholic detective (and one does wonder how she kept her job all those years.) Then she discovers that the leader of the gang she had infiltrated is back, and she sets out on a quest for personal revenge against him.The story had potential, but I honestly felt that the potential was largely wasted. I understood the basic plot - it's not really that difficult - but I did find this pretty muddled in how the story was told. Flashbacks are the in thing now, I know (to the point of being somewhat too cliche) and this movie also used the increasingly tired device of starting at a particular point that the story then had to go back to work up to. I also thought the whole story of Erin's relationship with her teenaged daughter was extraneous. I suppose it served to point out that the trauma Erin suffered long ago had totally warped her personal life as well as her professional life, but, to me at least, it added little of importance except a subplot I didn't particularly care about and it just added to the somewhat poor pacing of the film.It's not a disaster - but to be honest I was hoping for somewhat better.

13,MOscarbradley,A feminist take on a male-orientated genre,7,17 May 2019,"Nicole Kidman with 'ugly' make-up, (a little over-applied, if you ask me), is the LA detective with issues out to catch the demonic villain from her past and who was responsible for screwing up her life. This means we jump back in time to when Kidman was a much prettier young undercover detective, (this time made up to look much younger than her actual 51 years), infiltrating said villain's gang, a mission that leads to a heist that goes badly wrong. Catching Silas now, (for that is the name of the said villain played grimly by Toby Kebbell), will, she hopes, lead to closure of a sort.As a crime movie Karyn Kusama's ""Destroyer"" is slow and detailed with a couple of beautifully executed action sequences. The fact that in the present day sequences Kidman is working alone and with impunity might make it feel a little less credible than if she had a partner but that's a minor quibble in a movie that has a touch of the Michael Mann's about it while Kidman is always good value for money. Nice too to see a feminist take on what is usually a fundamentally male-orientated genre even if it could to with a trim here and there.",Destroyer
14,Pjtaylor-96-138044,The last enemy that shall be destroyed.,8,28 January 2019,"'Destroyer (2018)' is primarily a film about regret, revenge and self-destruction. It uses its somewhat slow but self-assured style to expertly deliver upon its grizzled, 1970s detective-drama feel, which is something that perforates both above and below its skin. It almost seems like the movie itself is working through a painful backstory, chugging past its genre clichés with confidence to get to its strangely more substantial roots. Its restrained yet unafraid approach perfectly mirrors the attitude of its lead, who spends the majority of the picture in a tremendous amount of pain and looks as though she still needs to nurse her long-dealt bruises. You're never quite sure what she's going to do. She's actually quite unconventional, despite being founded in an age-old archetype, in both how deep she is and in the fact that she is very much a she, with her femininity (as it relates to her character) never being compromised for the sake of filling a typical 'tough cop' leading role. It's actually quite refreshing. Kidman pulls it off perfectly, turning in a quiet but captivating performance. The rest of the cast are all great, too; every few scenes, a well-known character-actor pops up to more-than earn their keep. The structure of the picture plays with expectation in some exciting ways, most of which relate to its apparent underlying thesis regarding the cyclical nature of its core themes. The two primary timelines that are explored mirror each other interestingly and provide context for one another at exactly the right moments, never feeling over-expository or unnecessary. In general, the mysteries that are presented using this technique are fascinating to watch unfold and certainly outshine what initially appears to be the main 'investigation' of the narrative, which is admittedly a little 'go to guy A, B, C and so forth'. Every interaction is just so grounded and believable; even the most traditional of beats are brilliant to watch, especially since most are augmented by surprising choices either in the scene or character department. Also, despite not typically focusing on action set-pieces, it features one of the best staged and most tense 'realistic' gunfights I've seen on-screen in a long time. The overall experience is very engaging; it plays out almost like a puzzle, in a way. It isn't exactly predictable, either. Some misdirects maybe aren't as successful as they're intended to be but I don't think that matters. The story is layered and rich. This is more so in terms of its character-work, exploration of themes and eventual presentation than in its beat-by-beat plotting. Still, even at its most conventional, it comes across pretty much impeccably and certainly sits near the top of its genre (whatever that may be, exactly). It's refreshingly good. 8/10",Destroyer
15,dromasca,Nicole Kidman's 'Monster',6,17 January 2019,"I like the way Nicole Kidman chooses her roles lately. Of course, after 35 years of career, 84 roles, and one Academy Award she has less need to prove anything to the world and she can just search for interesting roles, scripts, and film directors and work for fun and for the pleasure of walking unexplored paths. The role in 'Destroyer' seems to be inspired by a similar casting decision made 15 years ago by Charlize Theron with her role in 'Monster' which brought an Academy Award to the beautiful South-African born actress for a role in which terrific make-up disfigured her to the brink of being non-recognizable in a role of a prostitute turned into a serial killer. The film directed by Karyn Kusama also disguises Kidman for part of the time, but the transformation she undergoes is not only physical. Unfortunately, from many points of view 'Destroyer' does not succeed to the same level achieved by the film that made Patty Jenkins famous (fame renewed recently by the new 'Wonder Woman' series).The story. LAPD detective Erin Bell looks and behaves like a walking dead in the huge and violent city. She actually may have virtually died 16 years ago, when an undercover mission she took part in went wrong. Nothing seems to raise positive feelings in her, not even the relationship with her teenage daughter who prefers to live with her ex-husband, and seems to be making some bad choices in her own life. The only feeling that may motivate her is a desire for revenge which is awaken when a murder that seems to be related to her past happens. There are two story lines in the film and the action oscillates between the two: one is the very unorthodox murder inquiry which Erin is conducting merely in order to find the man behind the destruction of her life, and the flashbacks that will gradually clarify the reasons of her behavior in the events that turned upside down the path of her life.What I liked. Film director Karyn Kusama succeeds to make clear both the psychological thriller story and the action scenes. Nicole Kidman's acting is convincing, and her make-up in the present day is excellent.What I liked less. While the script is well-written and we slowly discover the dark past of the character, there is one big flaw that makes the whole story less credible. I believe that even in the crime-ridden LA described in the film, a police officer with such an erratic behavior would be suspended on the spot, not trusted to bear a gun and a badge of law officer. For a film that aspires to be realistic, this is a huge mistake in my opinion. There is also nothing likeable in this film, not even the lead character, certainly not the reality around her. Despite its ambitions the film is hard to watch, maybe also lasts a bit longer than necessary. Getting back again to 'Monster', that film had a social and moral messages. In 'Destroyer' it's just one bad choice in the past that seems to impact everything, the rest is pulp fiction and very grim reality.",Destroyer
16,ThomasDrufke,I Just Wanted One Good Thing,8,27 January 2019,"Now that I'm writing this review a full week later and with the Oscar nominations now out, it's worth mentioning just how much of a crime it is that Nicole Kidman got shut out for her incredible year she had in 2018. Even putting aside what I hear is a solid film with the recently released 'The Upside', she had great supporting turns in Aquaman and Boy Erased, along with one of her career best performances in the criminally unseen Destroyer. Moody, thrilling, and disturbing, Destroyer sees Kidman playing a cop haunted by her previous run-ins with a gang as she works through a case that could define her career for better or worse. Karyn Kusama does a wonderful job setting a creepy tone and bringing the absolute best out of her actors, which includes good turns from Sebastian Stan and unrecognizable performances from Kidman, Toby Kebbell, and Tatiana Maslany. It reminds me a lot of 2016's Nocturnal Animals, which could serve as a good companion film.8.2/10",Destroyer

20,eddie_baggins,Kidman delivers one of the performances of her career,6,30 June 2019,"For all the flaws and missed opportunities that arise within Karyn Kusama's newest film Destroyer, a darkly observed and different take on the gritty crime genre with a female centric twist, one thing remains a constant throughout, an undeniable and powerful force: its lead performer Nicole Kidman.Not afraid to transform psychically for her roles as evidenced previously across a multi-decade spanning career, Kidman's Golden Globe nominated (an Oscar worthy) turn as the emotionally tortured and outwardly unraveling detective Erin Bell is amongst the best work the esteemed actress has ever completed and a large reason why Destroyer should be sought out, even if it's sometimes frustrating story and mismanaged plot threads ensure Kusama's film never reaches grand heights.Kusuma who made her name with the female orientated Æon Flux and Jennifer's Body ensures that Destroyer is a gritty affair throughout, from the moment we meet Bell stumbling into a murder scene, looking disheveled, unwell and genuinely not up standard, the slow sprinkling of info as we learn what drove her to become the shell of a human she is today, and a detective hell bent on uncovering the whereabouts of local Los Angeles crime figure Silas, of whom she was at one time affiliated with on an undercover operation.It's a journey to the dark underbelly of the criminal world, led by a sometimes detestable anti-hero of sorts that we've seen countless times before and Kursama does struggle to do much with the character development and plot strands around Bell from Toby Kebbell's distracting hair, Sebastian Stan's thinly drawn partner to Bell Chris and the shouldn't of even bothered Scoot McNairy and Tatiana Maslany but despite the coldness of much of proceedings, thanks to Kidman, Destroyer's end coda and more emotionally driven moments are of the highest order, thanks entirely to Kusama's direction and Kidman's full bodied turn in these instances.It's the type of performance that would've been headline making had Destroyer managed to connect to a more tangible level between critics and audiences, as Bell's journey of redemption seeking vengeance and closure on a horrifying past occurrence is utterly commanding when Kidman is given time in the spotlight and when combined with Kusama's keen directional eye and Theodore Shapiro's expertly designed musical accompaniment, Destroyer feels like a much better film overall, one that's fresh take on an age old sub-genre would've been quite the memorable event had all the stars aligned.As it stands however, Destroyer is more a competent picture than a ground-breaking one, filled with scenes and a lead turn that appear to be from a more outstanding film, you can't help but walk away from this experience and wish for something more, even if it's never less than engaging thanks to Kidman's captivating turn.Final Say -Lacking the story nuance and emotional connection in too many areas, Destroyer may not be the film it had the potential to be but thanks to Kidman and some genuinely brilliant scenes, Kusama's film remains a film worthy of tracking down.3 interrupted batting practices out of 5",Destroyer

The movie lasts too long and is simply lacking punch, which is a much heard complaint by other Imdb reviewers as well. Simply put: it is a bit boring...I couldnt be charmed about it at all, but my girlfriend liked it.

Some of the best story arcs come from women being ground down to their lowest point, only to fight back and take revenge on those that have wronged them. In the first 10-15 minutes of 'Destroyer' I thought that was exactly what I was in for. Then slowly as things crawled along I began to realise just how bland of an experience this movie was sadly going to be.The lead character in your movie can't be completely lacking in personality. It just isn't an option. Nicole Kidman is a fantastic actress, but her character and the portrayal of it here were bordering on atrocious. It is not fun to watch a depressed person be depressed. Then add in the fact that the movie had very little action (admittedly one of the few action sequences it does have in a bank is actually very well done) and the dialogue is incredibly mundane and you find yourself with a very long two hours ahead of you.I can't remember the last time I went into a movie with this much anticipation and was so let down. I just didn't have a good time with 'Destroyer' at all. Not one I would recommend.",Destroyer

26,stevendbeard,Not Much New,5,4 February 2019,"I saw ""Destroyer"", starring Nicole Kidman-Aquaman, Bewitched_2005; Toby Kebbell-Fantastic Four_2015, The Sorcerer's Apprentice; Sebastian Stan-Bucky Barnes in the Marvel movies, Hot Tub Time Machine and Bradley Whitford-Get Out, Young Guns 2.
Nicole plays an LA cop that has her past come back to haunt her. About 17 years ago, she went on an undercover job with Sebastian as her partner-both on the job and off. They were infiltrating a gang of bank robbers led by Toby when things went bad and Toby escaped. In the present, Nicole discovers clues that Toby is back in town and planning on resuming business, which doesn't sit well with her-she wants to put him in the ground. Bradley is a typical sleazy lawyer with connections that Nicole needs, to get to Toby. Not much new here but the main draw is Nicole's acting make-up-less. That's all I've heard critics talking about is that she looks so unrecognizable-but not a word about how recognizable the plot is.
It's rated ""R"" for language, violence, sexual content-no nudity-and drug use and has a running time of 2 hours & 1 minute.
It's not one that I would buy on DVD. If you are really interested in seeing how bad Nicole can look when she wants to win an Oscar, then it would be alright as a rental. Otherwise, I would wait until it comes to cable.",Destroyer

Her hands liver-spotted though she is only in her 40s, she looks broken down, now an old case comes back to haunt her. Seventeen years ago she had gone undercover with a partner and infiltrated a gang of bank robbers, the outcome of that mission has preyed on her mind ever since.The action cuts between the present day and the time when she was undercover where Kidman convincingly portrays Bell in her 20s. Bell wreaks a trail of havoc as she tries to find the leader of the gang who escaped her all of those years ago, he has let her know that he is back. Her obsession makes her go rogue, after she has beaten information from a crooked lawyer she tells him that she is doing it for his good as well. When her wayward daughter ends up in hospital she demands to know why no one is accountable. Totally misjudging a situation as she trails suspects she puts civilians, herself and other cops in danger.

31,peterp-450-298716,Maybe in a way a nice piece of work but mediocre at the same time.,5,16 April 2019,"What's up?
Silas is back.Obviously, the most striking element of this film is the transformation of Nicole Kidman. Her weathered, unkempt appearance with black-rimmed eyes, smudged skin, and a tousled haircut indicate an unhealthy lifestyle and a stubborn addiction. It soon becomes clear that the bottle has become her closest friend. Normally Nicole Kidman looks so snappy and flashy in other films. Here's she's shabby and unrecognizable. The past took a heavy toll on her during an undercover operation where her partner Chris (Sebastian Stan) drew the short straw. Erin Bell (Nicole Kidman) has since lived in a daze. Probably an attempt to erase the past and to alleviate the pain in her ruined life.The film is a circular story, peppered with a lot of flashbacks. I myself am not a fan of films that jump back and forth on the timeline, but in this case, I thought it was skilfully put together. So when at the start of the film Erin Bell wakes up from her alcoholic intoxication and appears at a crime scene, this is the moment when she realizes that something from the past is back on her track. And the unknown dead guy lying there with an ink-stained dollar bill is the start of a long search for Silas (Toby Kebbell), the cause of all her troubles. And that search will show destruction, corruption, and desolate living conditions. Something that fits Erin Bell wonderfully. It's payback time and nothing can stop Erin Bell to do just that.Despite the pitiful appearance and the excellent make-up used on Nicole Kidman, the image of a handsome and glamorous film diva, as she is, still remained on my retina. No matter how hard she tried and the way she worked herself into the role of the rebellious and cursing detective who consumes her portion of alcohol every day. It just didn't work out for me. Maybe not really fair to Nicole Kidman. But it feels the same as Jim Carrey playing a serious, dramatic role or Arnold Schwarzenegger doing a comedy. Well, guess she can't get rid of that image. Being biased is a strange thing. All credit to Kidman for making a bold choice to leave her comfort zone and take on such a daring role.Unfortunately, the Nicole Kidman stunt is also the only thing that made an impression (even though I mainly read negative criticism about it) because for the rest it's just a disappointing and scanty story. The main part deals with the undercover operation where Erin and Chris infiltrate the Silas gang. On the one hand, Silas is a fascinating character. A cruel, sadistic person who's unapproachable and manipulative. A fearless leader who cannot tolerate contradiction and punishes misconduct without mercy. On the other hand, it's not something we haven't seen before. The other members aren't particularly interesting and only serve to help Erin with her search. The only noteworthy thing is Jade Pettyjohn as the rebellious teenage daughter Shelby. However, her contribution is too limited to form an opinion.Even though they tried to be inventive when it comes to the timeline. And even if the film had some beautiful scenes. And the footage of the bank robbery, where Erin unconsciously winded up in, was unparalleled (the most action-packed scene of this film). I still missed sharpness. It wasn't edgy. It all felt too easy. It wasn't more than a story about police work, corruption and taking revenge. I don't dispute the fact that the story is technically a crafty piece of work. But in general, it wasn't really impressive. Kidman's make-up caused bewilderment. Once the shock effect was over, it felt more like a gimmick.More reviews here: movie-freak.be",Destroyer

Starring Nicole Kidman, Sebastian Stan, Toby Kebbel, Tatiana Maslany, Jade Pettyjohn, Bradley Whitford, Scoot McNairy, James Jordan, Beau Knapp, Toby Huss. (R)Grim, brooding crime drama centered on haggard detective Kidman (barely recognizable except in flashback) suspecting that criminal Kebbel, who she associated with when she was undercover years ago, is responsible for a recent murder. As an experience, sometimes grueling, sometimes riveting; as a story, it covers pretty familiar territory, masking its late-game revelations in ways that are less clever scheme than artifice. Proudly wears its no-holds-barred badge, even at excess (the protagonist even grudgingly trades sexual favors for information at one point); though never dull, its pace sometimes resembles the sluggish shuffle that Kidman sports. She is what holds the film together, a weary but obsessed figure stalking the city on a slow-burn rampage, pausing only to measure the weight of regret and loss for her and her fractured family.68/100",Destroyer

TV director Karyn Kusama, her writer hubby Phil Hay, along with his co-writer Matt Manfredi look like being names to consider adding to a must avoid list. With a sludge fund of impossible to like characters - who continue to become more detestable as the minuets tick by (and there are 2 long Hrs worth that go very slowly). You will be forgiven if you walk (no, run) out on this grot-fest of undesirable situations and characters (my audience was gone within the first 25mins). I, being a glutton for punishment had to stay to see just how much worse it could get --struggled to the bitter end-- did it get better? Sadly not.It's another of those simple stories that's been given an unnecessary flash-back flash-forward edit job - in an attempt to make you think its deep and meaningful, it isn't. Nichole Kidman is heading down the road to self ruin by taking any script that's thrown at her - leaving any followers left to think twice, before any longer bothering to follow her career. It's as if she mistakenly feels, as these cheap writers do, that you have to keep going lower down the moral scale to be noticed.

41,juliankennedy23,"I wouldn't see it again, but I am glad I saw it once.",7,16 April 2019,"Destroyer (2018): 7 out of 10 Destroyer is an interesting beast. Part Oscar Bait for Nicole Kidman (they didn't bite, though she did manage a Golden Globe nomination), part artistic tour de force by Girlfight (2000) and Æon Flux (2005) director Karyn Kusama and actual part movie about things that happen. Director Kusuma seems to be going for the gritty, tough girl realism of Close (2019) as well as the avant-garde dreaminess of (2017)'s Gemini but without the latter's visual flair.The basic plot is that Nicole Kidman plays a very burnt out LA Detective who is searching for a man who killed her partner many years ago. She has a self-destructive focus, and the rest of her life comes tumbling down. Yes, you have seen this movie before.The Good: Oscar bait or not Nicole Kidman is fantastic in this film. She makes it work both through her acting and physical presence. Her performance is on the level of Charlize Theron's in Monster.The rest of the cast is also quite good with a shoutout to Bradley Whitford's slimy lawyer. I have grown to appreciate Mr. Whitford in movies as the years have gone by and he hits it out of the park here as what turns out to be an audience surrogate trying to talk sense into both the protagonist and the plot.Praise as well to whoever did Nicole Kidman's make-up; it is flawless for the role. Dramatic aging or addict makeup is so easy to get very wrong as anyone who has seen Amy Smart as a crack addict in the Butterfly Effect will attest. It isn't just Kidman's either as co-star Tatiana Maslany undergoes a similar transformation that is just as impressive.Also, the actual story is quite good. It has a lovely twist with about ten minutes to go that makes the entire film even better in retrospect. This movie was very close to being great.The Bad: In Peter Benchley's summertime classic novel Jaws there is a surprisingly large number of pages devoted to the affair between Chief Brody's wife and Matt Hooper. Spielberg wisely excised this nonsense from a movie about a shark eating people.If only Spielberg had taken a similar once over to the Destroyer script.Destroyer is a movie about an undercover job gone wrong through a series of terrible decisions by Nicole Kidman and her partner. And it is also about Nicole Kidman's attempt at closure through singleminded revenge.Destroyer has plenty of plot for a ninety-minute film, but for some reason, there is a substantial subplot involving Nicole Kidman's daughter (played by Jade Pettyjohn who is fine mind you) that eats up too much of the film and honestly distracts both the character and the audience from the story proper.The film grinds to a halt when the daughter's storyline pops in. If the film had spent this time in flashback with Nicole bonding with her partner or the gang more, it certainly would have been a more compelling watch and would have gone a long way to explain a seventeen-year-old grudge. As it is the films tepid description of both the gang and Nicole's feelings towards her partner makes Bradley Whitford's advice early in the film ""You know what successful people do, Detective Bell? They get over sh#t. They move on, and they build things."" ring more accurate than perhaps the filmmaker intended.Where was I? Oh yeah, the daughter. So instead we get a bratty sixteen-year-old with an age-inappropriate punchable boyfriend and various dramas that have zero payoffs concerning the rest of the film and are not entertaining on their own.The Ugly: There is a unique twist at the end of this film. Had it ended there I probably would have given it an 8 out of 10. Here it was the coup de gras, and all the cinematic sins fade away. Here is a tough girl making things right through street smarts and tenacity. Fin.And then the film decides to beat that same drum for another ten minutes while what I am assuming is the Kronos Quartet screeches more and more high-pitched violin noises in an ever-rising key. Honestly, I am surprised we didn't get a shot of a plastic bag floating in the wind.These last ten minutes of nothingness broke me. Destroyer is overlong, and it has a very languid pace. A lot less would be more. Over the entire film, we have about half an hour of artistic shots that seem to pile one upon another like some Indie film parody reel.Not In Conclusion: Hey is it me or is the bank they rob the same one that you rob during The Paleto Score in Grand Theft Auto V? I had to mention this but where to put such brilliant insights within a review?
In Conclusion: For those looking for excitement or adventure this might not be your bag. It is too earnest by half, the protagonist's motivation doesn't hold water, and everything is depressing. It is worth watching or Nicole Kidman's performance, however. I wouldn't see it again, but I am glad I saw it once.",Destroyer
42,spookyrat1,Soul Taker!,8,11 June 2019,"I recently wrote a review of Karyn Kusama's utterly underwhelming Jennifer's Body and so it's pleasing that I can report that the director is capable of producing far more impressive work, based on a viewing of her latest project, Destroyer. Again working within her usual themes of exploring stories involving strong, but extremely flawed female characters, in a film co-written by her husband Phil Hay, Kusama has created a Los Angeles-set crime thriller come ""kinda"" police procedural, quite unlike anything this writer has seen in awhile.Her greatest asset in depicting this tale of a traumatised, burnt out former undercover police officer seeking to gain some redemption and relevance from a career and life full of mistakes, regrets and tragedies, some self-made, is Nicole Kidman. In a superbly haunting performance, Kidman succeeds in making the uncompromising, eternally dishevelled and disordered Erin Bell, somehow an unlikely personality, deserving of our sympathies. She finds herself compelled to face down and overcome ghosts from her past, when investigating (entirely off the reservation) the murder of an unknown criminal, who Bell knows was associated with a Manson-like gang, she had infiltrated in the past.Like its damaged protagonist, Destroyer is far from perfect. Kusama needed to expect a higher quality of exposition from co-writers Hay and his (also) producing partner Matt Manfredi. The structure of the film is centred around a constant stream of flashbacks from the present, through to events occurring primarily 17 years previous, when Bell and and an FBI undercover agent become embedded in this dangerous bank robbery gang, led by the sadistically charismatic Silas, an unforgettable, but somewhat underused, Toby Kebbell. We are left wondering why the legal authorities went to all the trouble and hazards of nefariously inserting 2 undercover agents, rather than simply busting the gang, which we assume to have committed a string of violent robberies. Bell's life over the past 17 years is also too lightly sketched. All we really find out is that she has an ex-partner Ethan, who is the step-father, to Bell's unsurprisingly, troubled and rebellious adolescent daughter,Shelby.The support cast is uniformly excellent with special mention, other to that which is already written, going to Sebastian Stan's Chris, echoing appropriately faint strains of his Winter Soldier persona and an unlikely Bradley Whitfield showing up, as a bent, untrustworthy, but paternally caring lawyer, Di Franco.Theodore Shapiro's stirringly evocative soundtrack hybrid of sounds and music only adds to the foreboding atmosphere of an unpredictable, but suspense-filled storyline, which some may well argue, short changes the audience in terms of the promoted ""action"" component.If you choose to see Destroyer for one reason, it should be to appreciate the talents and skills of Nicole Kidman, almost unrecognisable, but ironically playing one of her most memorable roles in her long, distinguished and awarded career. It's a pity then, but understandable given its bleak content, that Destroyer, despite generally good reviews, didn't achieve greater commercial success, amongst the cinema-attending public.",Destroyer
43,bob-the-movie-man,A career best from Kidman.,9,21 July 2019,"""Destroyer"" seems to have had mixed reviews, but it is really one of the most gripping watches I've seen in 2019.The plot is both familiar (think ""The Departed"" mixed with ""Hell or High Water"") but at the same time intricate. Nicole Kidman plays police detective Erin Bell who's in a bad place. She looks to be on her last legs through drink and drugs, but she is being propped up in her post by an understanding boss and a tolerant partner (who spends most of his time leaving ""Where the hell are you?"" voicemails).Erin is in pursuit of a truly evil man - Silas (Toby Kebbell) - who is back after a long absence. Erin and Silas have a past that is only unfolded as the film evolves. (To say more would ruin what is an outstandingly well-constructed screenplay). Aside from the ""day job"", what Erin also has to contend with her truly wayward 16 year old daughter Shelby (Jade Pettyjohn).It's an astonishing performance. Nicole Kidman is simply extraordinary in this role. As ably demonstrated recently in the excellent ""Big Little Lies"", Kidman at 52 years old, is still utterly gorgeous in the flesh. But In the same way that Charlize Theron ""uglied up"" for ""Monster"", so Kidman here is almost unregonizable as the police officer on the edge. Apparantly she could barely walk due to a bout of the flu during the final scenes of the film, so the acting here required not a huge amount of acting! But it's a terrific performance and one that I think justly deserves a Best Actress Oscar nomination. I'd be genuinely disappointed if she didn't get one for this.Standout performances also come from Sebastian Stan as Erin's former squeeze Chris and Jade Pettyjohn as young Shelby. Great to also see Bradley Whitford (""West Wing"") in a cameo as a truly smug and obnoxious money launderer.The screenplay by Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi (who wrote the ""Ride Along"" franchaise) is also artfully done, to the extent that again I would personally nominate it for an Oscar. It's true, that the good cop / bad cop movie and the bank heist movie have been done countless times before, such that it feels immediately familiar. And the tone of the film (supported by an effectively stress-inducing music score by Theodore Shapiro) reminded me of ""You Were Never Really Here"". But here the continuous and dizzying flashing between timelines kept me on my toes and I for one didn't see the stunning twist in the tale coming at all.Credit must also go to director Karyn Kusama, who is new to me, who keeps the action moving at a slick pace such that I wasn't for one second bored.Perhaps if there's a criticism here it's that we don't get to see enough of the characterisations fleshed out. This is particularly true of the villain of the piece, Silas, who is painted sufficiently well as being on-the-edge and unhinged, but not unrepentantly ""shoot a granny in the face"" evil.I missed this at the cinema, so it took a plane journey to catch up on it. It's a heady mix of criminality, justice, revenge and atonement, and it made the journey just fly by.

47,RJBurke1942,Being the last working day of a cop on the job,8,2 October 2019,"The singular aspect of this story is not the acting, although that's superbly professional, especially from Nicole Kidman as Erin Bell, undercover FBI agent. It's not the actual story, being a standard crime drama about a gang of bank robbers with Bell and her partner, Chris (Sebastian Stan), as infiltrators to bring the gang to justice. It's not any part of the cinematography, editing, special effects etc. And while it's more than ably directed by Karyn Kusama, it's not even that....It's the structure that's the standout for this effort, with its interleaved ellipses of different times in her past, which focuses upon Erin mostly, Chris - also her lover, and Erin's daughter, Shelby (Jade Pettyjohn).The opening scene has Erin sitting in her car, waiting. We don't know why. Maybe it's morning, maybe not. She's watching, in her rear vision, skate boarders fooling around behind her. Erin looks like death warmed over. A 211 call comes over her radio. She acknowledges, gets out. We see her approaching one of the city's canals where a body lies; two cops, yellow tape, already there. There is a short exchange of words we hear, but cannot comprehend, fully. We next see Erin in her auto, skate boarders still active, Erin still waiting....And from there onwards ... we're inside Erin's head while she sits, grimacing, recalling the details of how and why she's waiting, delving into her 17 year past, to pull all the pieces together of how she and Chris got into the murderous gang of bank robbers; the dangers they faced; the love that developed between them; the shock and sadness for Erin when Shelby became involved with shady characters; the mistakes Erin and Chris made while undercover; the disappearance of Silas (Toby Kebbell), the sadistic gang leader, and his recent re-emergence; and finally the last, brutal bank robbery which brings Erin full circle to finish the job she and Chris began all those years ago.Destroyer is downbeat almost to the last frame: there's not a shred of light relief in the entire two hours. And, while there are those who find the structure problematic, it's nowhere near as confusing as other movies with similar structures. For example, it doesn't have the bizarre nature and artistic flare of Mulholland Drive (2001); likewise, Jacob's Ladder (1990), where we 'see' inside a dying soldier's last thoughts; and Destroyer lacks the visceral, bloody horror of You Were Never Really Here (2017). Obviously, though, the movie demands your attention to sort out Erin's disjointed thoughts as she tries to make amends for all her faults and transgressions. In doing so, she brings the narrative - her story - to a fitting end; and to a delicious, unexpected revelation.Hence, it's an engrossing story, with Kidman in every scene and almost every frame. Throughout, a suitable soundtrack adds the desired dramatic and emotional affects and effects. And Nicole Kidman is utterly terrific, categorically.Recommended for adults only. Give this one eight out of ten.October 2nd, 2019.",Destroyer

There's a totally unnecessary (kind of sexual) scene with Nicole and a villain in bed, she does him a 'favour' that didn't make sense.The film pretty much end where it starts, which is becoming a tad cliché.

51,Alexander_Blanchett,Nicole Kidman destroyed,8,13 February 2019,"What a tour de force performance by Nicole Kidman. Simply incredible. Its hard to believe that she gotten more recognition for it beyond that Golden Globe nomination. Truly one of her best performances - and that is coming from a huge fan. And its not the deglam thing - no she dived so deep into that character and not only physically transformed but also emotionally. We really saw the birth of a true character.
The film itself is not bad by any means either. Actually very good. Its an interesting crime story with a little twist at the end that turns the film totally around. Really liked that. Also the more Kidman's character broke the more she physically transformed which was a great creative decision.
Still the direction of Karyn Kusama was probably the weakest effort of the film because it had something very uneven. And no I did not blame the screenplay for that. The other performances were fine. The most memorable one was Sebastian Stan but also Tatiana Maslany had one good scene. Jade Pettyjohn was also very good and makes an interesting new comer. Bradley Whitford was fine in his short performance. I wasnt a fan of Toby Kebbell. Besides one good film he made a rather pale villain.
The score was great and totally fitted the mood of the film. Yes, very worth to see after all.",Destroyer

To track him down and make peace with her past, she must find the rest of the members to gather intel. The film is gathering a lot of attention for Kidman's central performance and she is very good playing a character that is quite different from her previous roles; someone who is hell bent on revenge, battle worn and carrying the weight of the world on her shoulders. There were moments I was reminded of Nicola Cage's awesome performance in Bad Lieutenant; particularly in the more fun sequence involving Erin psyching herself up in a mirror and busting out of a bathroom to kick the hell out of someone. Director Karyn Kusama (AeonFlux, Jennifer's Body) deserves joint appraisal with Kidman for a precise and dark vision of the subject matter which does enhance the exploration of the themes. Although the dialogue is sometimes iffy, writers Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi (R.I.P.D, Ride Along) have written really interesting relationships between lovers and particularly between mother and daughter here; I thought it was a really engaging subplot!

62,movieman6-413-929510,With Destroyer both Karyn Kusama and Nicole Kidman make a comeback in the thriller genre.,6,15 March 2019,"Destroyer is a new crime thriller directed by Karyn Kusama, the director of The Invotation and Girlfight.The film is about LAPD detective Erin Bell (Nicole Kidman), who used to work as an undercover agent. Then she went undercover with a gang of bank robbers, led by the cunning Silas (Toby Kebbell), but when a bank robbery went wrong, Erin was exposed and Silas escaped.
When Silas returns to the criminal world sixteen years later, Erin decides to confront her past. She decides to visit the old gang members of Silas again to interview them in order to get information about Silas and his plans. Once she knows what he has planned, she must stop him before he can carry out his plans.With this crime thriller, both Karyn Kusama and Nicole Kidman make a good comeback, because since 2015, both have not worked on films like this. This film has an interesting story about someone who has to confront her own past. The scenes in which the story passes from the now to the past has been brought forward in a fun and creative way by Karyn Kusama in the film. The scenes in the past have a more glowing satisfied tone, while the scenes in the now appear just a bit more dark and a bit chaotic. They did this well to show how the main characters feel or felt during these different scenes.At a time this film can come across as a bit too long-winded. This is because the film focuses on the research and the interrogations that the main character does. If they had used the same kind of situations less in the film, the film could well have been half an hour shorter, which would have made the film a little more entertaining. Despite the fact that the plot in the middle of the film may seem a bit long-winded, the end seems a bit too rushed. The tension of the end and the confrontation with the gang boss will decrease somewhat and the end of the film may be disappointing.Nicole Kidman does good acting in this film as a detective with a dark past, who has to do his own research to get answers. In the film she wears different wigs and makeup, because in the scenes that play back in the past she looks a little better cared for and in the scenes in the now her wig and makeup look a bit messier. Fortunately, the film does not show that she is wearing a wig. Toby Kebbell also portrays good acting in the film as a cunning and slippery criminal leader, who knows how to play his gang members well.",Destroyer

The glamorous icon of the silver screen plays totally against type in this movie. She's a dishevelled, sleep-deprived cop who looks painfully emaciated, shuffling through Los Angeles with her clothes hanging from her. She looks perpetually exhausted and when she falls asleep onscreen, it's actually a relief.She's a veteran Police Officer who goes on the hunt for Toby Kebbell's gang leader without telling her superiors. She seeks out his former acquaintances, playing a game of Join The Dots through the seedy underbelly of the city and hoping they'll lead her to him for a reckoning. At the same time, a parallel story from sixteen years earlier unfolds, showing her as a young undercover cop infiltrating his gang alongside her partner slash lover.It's not a pleasant watch but it makes for an engaging '70's style cop drama. Serpico, The French Connection and their ilk were clearly an influence on this sun-drenched noir and while it is a little slow, Destroyer is elevated by Kidman's stellar central performance. Kebbell deserves a great deal of credit too, playing the arch villain like Patrick Swayze's manipulative cult-leader in Point Break, only with less surfboards and more unfiltered evil.Some of the dialogue is a little clunky and the alternating timelines are occasionally awkward, but this was a good movie.

65,Thrashman88,Bleak Crime Drama,8,20 January 2021,"Interesting film about detective Erin Bell's (played by an almost unrecognizable Nicole Kidman) quest for payback, never overcoming from an old undercover assignment gone tragically wrong.
I had never heard anything about this film until a couple of days ago, surfing the movie catalog on Amazon Prime Time. I understand the film underperformed in theaters, which is a shame.Nicole Kidman gives a defining performance as the Devil may care detective Bell. Despite the awesome make up done on one of Hollywood's most attractive actresses, it turns into a distracting factor while watching the film. She looks like an extra from ""The Walking Dead"", with the extreme make up that was applied on her. It is never mentioned what caused Bell's junkie look; sure, she had booze issues but it's never mentioned whether she took or is taking drugs or if she suffered from some sort of skin disorder.
Only during the flashback scenes about the undercover job do we see Kidman sort of looking ok and even in those scenes she is under heavy make up.Director Karyn Kusama gives us a bleak look at L.A. You think of series like ""Lucifer"", where we see a very nice and tidy Los Angeles compared to the one we see in ""Destroyer"". Her directorial style here is the ""the beginning is actually the ending"", but I didn't know that until the last couple of scenes.In a nutshell, I did enjoy ""Destroyer"". It's not a commercial, crowd pleasing film and I would blame the studio for not giving it enough promotion. Don't expect a fast paced movie, but once ""Destroyer"" sinks into you it won't let go.",Destroyer
66,themadmovieman,"It might not seem like much at first, but Destroyer is an ingenious and multi-layered piece of filmmaking",8,25 January 2019,"On the surface, this is a solid crime drama with a gritty atmosphere, emotional intrigue, and some great make-up work. If you go deeper, though, it proves to be so much more, with an ingenious screenplay that holds its cards brilliantly throughout, furthered by striking directing from Karyn Kusama, and a staggering performance from Nicole Kidman, all of which makes Destroyer a film full of intrigue and surprises, and far more than what you may think of it at first glance.Let's start off with the story, which plays out detailing two different periods of Detective Erin Bell's life. On the one hand, we have the intrigue that follows her as she tries to seek out those from a past life of hers after encountering a suspicious murder, and on the other, we see her life undercover with those very people, and how it came to have an impact on her for years to come.At first, I have to say that it's a story structure that doesn't quite work, not giving up enough detail and background to really grab you over the course of the first act, and trying a little too hard to retain an air of mystery when a little more exposition is needed at times.With that said, if you stick with it, Destroyer will make it all worth your while, developing into a fascinating portrayal of life outside the law, all the while gradually linking up all of the mysteries and intrigue that it sets up early on as the true significance of everything that has come before becomes clearer.It's a difficult structure to get right, and while the parallel stories of Bell's undercover period and her current life prove a little disjointed early on, the film really comes into its own in the second and third acts, and opens up doors of drama and intrigue that you would have never expected at first, something that makes for an utterly enthralling watch.That ingenious screenplay is brought together brilliantly by director Karyn Kusama, who bides her time very effectively as the stakes begin to ramp up throughout. At first, the film may come off as a bit of a slow character study, but Kusama cleverly uses the lethargy and narrative ambiguity of the first act to draw you in without even realising it, and then with a series of stunning flashpoints throughout, completely changes the dynamic of the entire film, which keeps the story thoroughly engrossing, and brings you in ever deeper as the stakes continue to develop towards the finish.Kusama gives Destroyer a brilliantly mysterious vibe that's able to grab you in such organic fashion, and along with the gritty nature of its surface crime story, she also opens up the film to allow you to delve into the psyche of the main character, with the series of dramatic revelations playing in brilliantly to an ever-changing perspective around Detective Erin Bell.And that's where Nicole Kidman's performance comes in, which is without a doubt one of the best of her career. Again, while it may not seem so at first, Kidman is measured and very understated throughout, brilliantly portraying the tortured soul of a woman who has been through something very damaging, and while she conceals the true depth and scale of that emotion to let it all be played out by the screenplay, she's absolutely staggering to watch throughout.And then we have the make-up work, which is just as impressive. Sometimes, performances that go against type for A-list actors can come off as somewhat of a gimmick, but along with Kidman's brilliant turn, the heavy make-up that's used adds so, so much to her character. From first glance, she's clearly a battle-hardened and tortured individual, but the make-up is so striking - at times even proving the scene-stealing element - that it creates further mystery around Erin Bell, once again leading into the film's ingenious screenplay.Overall, I was hugely impressed by Destroyer. It's a film that may not seem like much at first, but if you give it time, it's all undoubtedly worth your while, with an ingenious screenplay with so much more depth than you could possibly imagine, striking and innovative direction from Karyn Kusama, scene-stealing make-up work, and a stunning central performance from Nicole Kidman.",Destroyer

The film centres on NK's character, Erin, who is clearly riddled with guilt from her past, when she went undercover to unmask the perpetrators of a series of heists. A brilliantly atmospheric mood throughout with a sometimes muddling plot which, I think, would benefit from a second viewing once you know how it all pieces together.

It's the sort of parody Wiig may do on SNL one day.For the porcelain princess this is a journey into LA's dark underbelly but whether it works as a real film, or is merely extended acting class for an actor seeking Abel Ferrara's territory to add to their work, is debatable.The film is not that successful: the technique of intercutting past and present to make a familiar story more interesting than it is, doesn't add much, but is slightly baffling at times The only clue is that Kidman's wig is different and her eyes are in the eye sockets, not sunken in the destructive pools of booze our broken heroine is consuming to forget the pain.After the initial intrigue, it settles into a routine which is quite familiar and loses interest and pace. It's not bad, but it is not so compulsive that all other thoughts are expelled by the drama on display.The sundered family, the errant daughter, all add to Kidman's anguish but not really to our reason to stay with it besides the morbid expectation that Kidman may change wigs, or even go bald.We can say that along with her absurd imitation of Virginia Woolf, Kidman is not really a character actor.

70,dschmeding,Self-Destroyer,8,17 February 2019,"I seriously do not get half of the reviews about this movie about it not having a plot and being slow or about the editing being confusing.
""Destroyer"" has a very straight forward plot that is not even using cheap twists but rather telling a straight story in a hypnotic trance way and cutting up the timeline to reveal information at the time the director considered it necessary.
I loved Karyn Kusamas ""The Invitation"" and ""Destroyer"" is a well made movie, no matter how you look at it. Nicole Kidman carries the movie along with the perfect choice of music that sucks you in and watch the plot unfold. This is not an action movie and if you fell for that its not the directors fault. Its a slow drama about a cop that made wrong decisions and tries to right her wrongs when her past with a bank heist gone wrong gets back to her 17 years later.I know people today have attention spans like moths but seriously... if you can't accept a slow drama for what it is, that says more about you than about the movie. And come on, its 2019... if you are confused by a non-linear timeline and can't wait till the movie clears up the confusion.... thats on you too.Don't expect this to be a violent revenge movie... its not. Well, at least its not the focus of ""Destroyer"", although the movie does not hold back when things go down. The drama elements are well played and the ending was quite touching to me. At its core this movie is about the desperate longing for escape from a cold, grey world and its quite obvious from the choice of locations and flats that always give off a bleak, worn down feeling. Music and cinematography make this work perfectly and the editing helped spice up a rather straight forward plot. If you liked Kusamas previous movies... go for it. The key ingredients of haunting atmosphere and slow unveiling of information to the viewer are there although this is a completely different movie than ""The invitation"". So don't fall for all the moths swarming IMDB. I can't put my finger on all those silly 1star ratings but honestly, it reeks of gender insecurity.",Destroyer
71,Bertaut,A superb central performance and an impressive aesthetic design elevate a quotidian plot,7,1 February 2019,"In a career spanning nineteen years, the output of director Karyn Kusama has been chequered, to say the least, with her oeuvre ranging from the excellent (Girlfight (2000), The Invitation (2015)) to the average (Jennifer's Body (2009), her section of the horror anthology XX (2017)) to the unwatchable (Æon Flux (2005)). With Destroyer, she once again teams with writers Phil Hay (to whom she is married) and Matt Manfredi, having previously worked with the duo on Æon Flux and The Invitation. Partly a film noir along the lines of The Killers (1946) or The Asphalt Jungle (1950); partly an anti-hero narrative depicting someone taking the law into their own hands, à la Dirty Harry (1971) or Death Wish (1974); and partly a heist movie borrowing more than liberally from Michael Mann's Heat (1995), Destroyer is an unashamedly pulpy genre piece, confrontationally ugly and unapologetically nihilistic, with crippling emotional trauma the protagonist's most salient characteristic.Of course, a damaged cop determined to settle one last score isn't exactly an original concept, and Destroyer never strays too far from the generic tropes seen in films such as The New Centurions (1972), To Live and Die in L.A. (1985), and Rampart (2011), or on TV shows such as Miami Vice (1984) and The Shield (2002). However, what it does bring to the table is that the archetypal ""he"" of such narratives is here a ""she"", with Kusama relying heavily on Nicole Kidman's startling warts-and-all performance to do most of the heavy lifting. Although the film does seem to be under the impression that it offers some portentous revelation about the nature of revenge and psychological torment, approaching every scene with an air of self-seriousness that can become grating, there are undeniably individual moments of great brilliance. And then there's that lead performance.Telling the story of burnt-out and psychologically damaged LAPD homicide detective Erin Bell (Kidman), the film follows her efforts to find Silas (Toby Kebbell), the former leader of a bank robbery crew who is possibly back in LA. At the same time, she is trying to deal with her rebellious daughter, Shelby (Jade Pettyjohn). Running concurrently to this, the film reveals via a series of flashbacks that 17 years prior, Bell and her then partner, Chris (Sebastian Stan), were given an undercover assignment to bust Silas and his crew. Posing as a couple, they successfully infiltrated the group, but, somewhere along the line, they fell in love for real, with subsequent events resulting in the damaged person Bell has become.Although Kusama doesn't explicitly foreground it, gender politics are an important aspect of the film. Much has been made of Kidman's physical transformation, although both Kusama and Kidman have argued that her appearance is not what the film is about, nor should it be critics' focus. Still though, we're not quite at a point where a woman altering her appearance for a role is unremarkable (when women do it, it's ""brave""; when men do it, it's ""acting""), and like Charlize Theron in Monster (2003), Kidman's commitment to the part can only be applauded. In terms of the type of character she's playing, much as did Caoilfhionn Dunne in little-seen Irish film In View (2016), Kidman commits to Bell as an unlikable, violent, and psychologically ruined character, which in and of itself challenges conventional notions of what a female lead should be. It's undeniably fascinating seeing an actress (and a major one at that) get her teeth into the kind of gritty, embittered, and irredeemable character we usually see a man play, especially insofar as the film resists the urge to soften Bell or provide her with a clear road to redemption. In this sense, she has a lot in common with LT (Harvey Keitel) in Bad Lieutenant (1992); much of what she does has just as good a chance of dragging her down further to hell as it does of lifting her up. But she's beyond caring about herself, concerned only with busting (and preferably killing) Silas. Of course, she's also a mother, and like so many male archetypes, she has not been there for her child. This aspect of her character in particular, compels the audience to ask questions of itself regarding how men and women are perceived on screen - is a woman neglecting a child more forgivable than a man doing so, or less; do we simply expect women to automatically be good mothers in ways we never consider in relation to men as fathers? What do our presuppositions about motherhood on screen say about us as individuals and as a society?Kidman's commitment to the role of Bell results in a chameleonic performance that carries most of the film's weight. Never afraid to take risks (see Dogville (2003), Birth (2004), Rabbit Hole (2010), The Paperboy (2012), Strangerland (2015)), Kidman completely immerses herself within Bell (who is both the destroyer of the title, and the destroyed). With Bell appearing in literally every scene, there's a sense of authenticity in Kidman's performance, almost as if this were a documentary, and Bell was a real person. It's haunting, disturbing, and heartbreaking all at once. Of course, Bill Corso's makeup design, Barbara Lorenz's hair styling, and, to a lesser extent, Audrey Fisher's costume design all play their part in turning Kidman into this broken shell. The flashback structure is also important vis-à-vis the performance, as Kidman plays Bell very differently in these scenes - her hair is more kempt, her skin smoother (via some subtle de-ageing VFX), her eyes don't droop, her teeth have not yet turned yellow, her gait is more upright, she smiles a couple of times, her voice is more authoritative. In the present, however, her memories have become a cancer which has taken over her body and soul, making her loathe herself, with her anguish subsuming every other facet of her being.An especially good scene for Kidman (and Pettyjohn) comes towards the end of the film. Bell and Shelby are in a diner, with Bell trying to scare some sense into her daughter, telling her that she has the potential to do something really good with her life. The dialogue then turns to Shelby explaining that when she was asked to talk about a happy memory with her mother, the only thing she could think of was getting lost in a forest in the middle of winter, with Bell carrying Shelby on her back. Shelby says, ""I felt safe because I was with you"". However, she then immediately turns it around, talking about how she realised something was wrong when she noticed Bell's shoes, which were not hiking boots, realising that they were completely lost, and prompting her to ask, ""why are we even out here?"" In the flashback, Bell has no answer. In the present, she sheds a couple of tears. But she still has no answer. It's a powerful scene for both actresses, probably the most emotional in the film.Aesthetically, Kusama's LA is as cynical as you're ever likely to see the city, and obviously owes a sizable debt to Michael Mann. The LA seen in Destroyer is a place of dried out waterways, burnt grass, a glaring sun, endless concrete that looks hot to touch, pollution, corruption, betrayal, graffiti, indiscriminate violence. Cinematographer Julie Kirkwood shoots the present in washed-out anaemic hues, white, beige, brown, lots of sun spots and lens flares, whilst she shots the past with a more saturated palette giving the impression of comfortable warmth rather than stifling heat; a neat metaphorical representation of Bell's mindset.Of course, there are problems. For the most part, the screenplay is unoriginal and by-the-numbers, and without the power of Kidman's performance, this would have been a straight-to-Blu-ray. Kusama also struggles to break free of the restraints of the genre, which is especially disappointing when you consider the depth of emotion she brought to the otherwise schlocky thriller, The Invitation. The script also seems to be holding something back, teasing the audience with the promise of a big reveal that will transpose Bell's story into something far more universal and esoteric. The first season of True Detective (2014) employed this technique as well, but the difference is that when True Detective pulled the trigger, the reveal was horrifying and worth the wait. In Destroyer, it's hard to be certain if there even was a reveal. The script is certainly aiming for profundity, but it's nowhere near as smart as it thinks it is. Along these lines, Kusama makes some very strange directorial choices. Look at the skateboarders near Bell's car in the opening scene, for example, shot chiaroscuro in extreme slow-motion not once, but twice. What exactly is their significance? Why does Kusama shoot them as if they are offering some kind of life-altering revelation? Are they supposed to act as a voiceless chorus? Are they a metaphor for something?Destroyer is an average story elevated by the commitment of its lead and some laudable aesthetic choices. It's a cynical and humourless film noir aspiring to something more substantial, but never really accomplishing it. However, its unflinching depiction of devastating emotional trauma, presenting Bell as an open wound, slowly bleeding out, is brilliantly handled. The complete inverse of films which depict characters responding to tragedy with humour, optimism, and determination, Destroyer is brutally nihilistic, giving us a character whose obsession is both keeping her alive and killing her.

A hard life's worth of eye baggage, desert cracked lips, permanent bed hair, and a staggering hangover gait, detective (barely) Erin Bell, formerly an undercover cop, is still smothered under those heavy, heavy covers.She's a mess. A cold, lifeless mess. And she owns the screen.A recent murder presses the rewind button on a series of unfortunate events, in which we get to see a young, ravishing Kidman, some horrific decisions, and eventually, after some puzzling but engrossing flashbacks, a final resolution.And though the clever story does eventually come together, it is a tad disappointing. This film is more about Kidman's powerfully understated and totally haunting performance. Her broken body barely able to carry any weight, fueled by what's left of her mind: a hazy cloud of regret, struggling to find some sort of redemption. Some sort of closure.

Who cares about anything that she is doing?Yes Kidman's acting is not her usual forte and she portrays but she is hardly a believable cop. She is more of Clint Eastwood wearing a wig and walking like a zombie. Dont get me started on the director, what was she trying to do? Dialogues are disastrous, characters underdeveloped, no plot; pace and flow are non existent. So called ""Vision""The only thing that got Destroyed in this movie was my will to live.

So why is this movie titled ""Destroyer"" who knows and the writers and director sure as hell don't care. This slow barely intriguing storyline with a bland twist at the end does not recieve high remarks. With a trailer showcasing a lethargic over the hill female undercover detective played by Nicole Kidman ducking bullets and kicking ass filled the screen no more than 90 seconds. The only other movie I can think of with that amount of fraudulent promotion was the film about Thurgood Marshall. Why did they sell us on action and suspense because the plot of the movie wouldn't peak enough interest by admitting how uneventful many of these scenes played out onscreen. The movie just had no real appeal as you watch it and with all the potential to be a good film I would hate to be the creators and or producers who dropped the ball getting behind this film. This movie is watchable but definitely not memorable I would skip this one but it is Kidman so you can check it out to get a closer look at a failed attempt.",Destroyer
83,mohit_sinsniwal,A film that paves a winding road it never reaches,7,26 May 2019,"Too many back and forth flash-backs throughout the entire 121 min slowly paced convoluted plot does not make for a good film - regardless of Kidman's decent (not great) performance.Director Karyn Kusama and writers Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi failed to accomplish their vision in creating a captivating film by convoluting simplicity with cliched typical underwhelming directing and writing. Had this films timeline been played out normally, it may have been somewhat entertaining - although the focus was too much on Kidman's character more than anything else. Chopping it with back and forth scenes added nothing more than an annoyance, as there was very little surprise or impact that wasn't already predictable, and the finale was very underwhelming.The camera work/cinematography was decent, although I would've rather seen less slow-mo and long fixated shots on irrelevant scenes. Had this film's pace been picked up substantially, and edited down to about 90 mins by cutting the convoluted and unnecessary portions out (e.g. skateboarders, walking in the snow, etc), I would have enjoyed it, instead of being left unsatisfied.A shame the producers focused more on bogus reviews instead of investing in more experienced director/writers equal to Kidman's level. You won't get an A-grade film by hiring A-list actors with B-grade TV-experienced writers and directors.Sadly it's only a very generous 7/10 from me, and all of that goes to the actors and score which were the only aspects that were stand-out/decent.",Destroyer

Here, she gives one of her best performances ever.Kidman's disheveled look in this film is meant to reflect years of anguish and burn-out, in short the psychological toll of her job. An absolutely desolute view of Los Angeles is seen through her exhausted, but still enraged eyes. Another plot layer deals with her challenging relationship with her teenage daughter who has gone astray. Those around Kidman's character rarely see things her way, but that's because she has a past of her own to resolve.Recommended as slow-burn material that gradually earns one's respect, even though I think a better editor would have made this a tighter film.",Destroyer

It does take a little while to settle into things and the core narrative is pretty basic upon reflection, but the excellent performances from the entire cast and the assured direction ensure that you are engaged right from the get-go and immersed in the world. It does feature some fantastic action set-pieces, which are confidently helmed, but Kusama ensures that the film doesn't get lost in this and it remains a detailed look at the core character and how her actions have affected her as well as those around her - leading to a good level of emotional investment too.

Nicole Kidman is one of those actresses; I think she is better than she gets credit for. In this movie she was nearly unrecognizable, so her acting stood out. That was a good thing.At the same time, the trend where pretty actresses choose roles where they are made to look less attractive is getting a bit repetitious and old and tired. In this case it worked, but I have mixed feelings about the trend. It's a shame some actresses have to tone down their looks for their acting ability to become more obvious.As for the movie itself, the basic plot was not very original. A lot of what happened was telegraphed, mostly because we've seen it before. I did like the twist in the plot; that was very well done. But getting there was a bit tedious, due to the stereotypical plot. I almost gave the movie 8 stars because of Kidman's performance. But the plot dragged my score down. Maybe it would have been more effective if it had been 10 or 15 minutes shorter.Should people watch this movie? Sure; it has its positive elements. Just don't expect greatness.",Destroyer

And the joy of it really is in the not knowing you're inside that. (If I piqued your interest just a little and you don't know what that is necessarily, don't google it! Go in cold.) Thinking back, it's actually kinda genius. That being said, portions of this movie are something of a slog and some parts definitely aren't well acted (I'm looking at you Silas and Silas's hair). But, hey... it's an original-as-heck film in 2018 even if it's disguised as a police procedural with a lot of ugly makeup on Nicole Kidman, and that's worth a whole lot.

All of my illusions were shattered upon seeing a broken-looking Nicole Kidman sans make-up. Yikes. That was scary, but the dialogue was even scarier. Maybe Dan should have helped the writer(s) out. Nicole hasn't been the same since working with Tom and Stanley. Maybe Eyes Wide Shut (my favorite Kubrick film by far) trigger-trapped her and, pardon the pun, Destroyed her. She's had a feral, hunger strike look about her since. Faraway eyes, mechanical movements. In intense close-up shots she passes for the female analogue of Pinocchio. Her acting is about as wooden. The best parts of this film are the bravura performances by Scoot McNairy and Tatiana Maslany. Two stars each for those two. Sadly, they do not get enough screen time here.

In all fairness, unless your name is Quentin Tarantino, I probably won't like your non-linear storytelling.Sandwiched between depressing insight into Kidman's rugged, washed up detective, are some unexpectedly impactful moments of tensity. The bank heist scene and its subsequent street pursuit knocked my socks off.

But (and I know some will accuse me of blasphemy right now) this movie gave me about the same feeling as The Usual Suspects did. Meaning you may have thought up this bloody awesome, mindblowing twist for the end of your movie but if the whole two hours building up towards it is just not that great or a bit boring, then....well, that can't be what we aim for right? Personally I rather watch a really entertaining movie with a lousy ending.Also for the record: I still thought Usual Suspects was much better then this.
Because this movie decides to give you information very late in the movie, I end up watching many long, loaded scenes, without me really knowing why I should care. Now I can watch 10 scenes without knowing and still be exited about finding that out later. But almost a whole movie...? No, not really.There definitely is an appealing story in it, so I completely get why some people will love it. But for me they just failed at the way they told it to me. I started out finding this movie very interesting, then slowly got more and more bored with it untill at some point the movie started seriously annoying me.

Good for her. Now that Nicole's got it out of her system, let's go back to roles she can play better. And Tatiana Maslany shows up and gives an inspired scene. Of course.HOWEVER....The movie shifts mercilessly between the present and 17 years before. Just as you figure out (if you're lucky) what's going on in the segment you're watching, poof, you shift times. Nicole is the focus, which is fine, and it's easy enough to keep track of her despite the time shifting. But the men....was it my imagination, or did they all have beards? Some guys (I'm guessing here, since I couldn't keep them straight) showed up in just one segment in one time period; others seemed to show up in a past and then a present segment. Every time the movie shifted times, it plopped you down in a new situation, so you had to figure out who was who and what was going on. Frankly, this was beyond my feeble abilities. I couldn't keep either the plot or the men straight.The director, Karyn Kusama, was at the screening. (I had never heard of her before, nor had I ever seen any of her other movies.) I asked her about the time shifting, the confusion, and who all the guys were. She said she sympathized (""poor feeble-minded idiot..."") but stuck to her ""vision."" She talked about a ""rhythm"" of the past vs. present segments. As chance would have it, she was standing outside the theatre afterwards, and I expanded on my question: How 80% of my attention was spent trying to figure out which guy was which, and how the time shifting made it all unnecessarily confusing. I suggested (not very tactfully, I admit) that she made the movie for film school students, not the general public. Her answer to that was revealing: ""If you watched it two or three times, you would see the richness...."" Excuse me!! Hello!! who watches a movie two-three times and analyzes all the details? The general public or film school students? She confirmed my point.Was I alone in my confusion? After she answered my question in the Q&A, the guy behind me tapped me on my shoulder and said, ""You're right."" In line for another movie the next morning, there was a group of six people who had seen ""Destroyer"" the night before. I simply asked ""What did you think of the movie?"" They all thought it was confusing. And a few days later, I met a very famous and experienced actress (no names, I don't want to get her in trouble) and asked her if she had seen ""Destroyer."" She had. ""What did you think of it?"" I asked. ""It was very confusing,"" she said. I rest my case.Now another thing that bothered me was Nicole saying ""Silas is back."" Unless I'm more confused than I realize, I think she says that BEFORE she gets a dyed bank note in the mail from Silas. So HOW does she know he's back??? It that a mistake in continuity???I'm left wondering why they didn't show this to two separate focus groups: First, the movie as is, with constant time shifting. Then a second version that is linear--it starts at the beginning and goes to the end. No time shifting. In my opinion, a linear movie would have just as much suspense, but eliminate all the confusion. Why don't studios do that? Because they're making movies for film school students?",Destroyer

123,srobertson-75103,Kept my attention but a little confused until the end,7,22 July 2019,"Overall, this was worth my time to watch. I was a little confused about what happened to this poor woman and I kept wondering if I missed something, but as it finally unraveled, everything was explained. So if you're going to watch this, just know that all the pieces will come together by the end of the movie. The ending scene repeats the opening scene but with more background to explain it.
Nicole Kidman was unrecognizable except for the flashbacks. I'm sure they must have used some zombie make up, contact lenses, wigs, etc to make her look so different and worn out. But she did a really good job.
I'm not much for shoot 'em up movies, but overall this had a real story behind it and only some scenes were violent.
This is definitely a dark movie with shady characters who live under the radar. If you're looking for a feel good movie, go elsewhere because this was sad and a little depressing.
I was almost expecting the Nicole Kidman version of Jennifer Garner's ""Peppermint"" - but this movie was totally different. This moved much slower and I felt like some scenes weren't totally necessary and would've preferred to get to the ending a little faster.
I would recommend it, but be patient for everything to unravel.",Destroyer
124,northernpaladin,Dark Redemption,7,24 January 2020,"This is a dark, dark movie and it takes a good 30 to 40 minutes to really hook you. It is an old tale of corruption, death, regret and redemption told in the past and present life of LA cop Kidman in one of her most physically and psychologically unattractive roles but it is Kusama's direction which makes it worth the watch. The seedy side of LA has been shown by many a director so nothing new there but Kusama gives a beauty to her daytime shots in the full glare of the punishing sun and the night shots have a Michael Mann quality to them. The mood is relentlessly sombre as we see how the damaged Kidman got to the present via the flash backs to her doomed love affair with Sebastian Stan and the sociopathic robbery gang they have infiltrated. Good support is offered by Stan and McNairy in roles that could have been given a bit more flesh but this is truly a director's film and we should be glad of that.",Destroyer
125,DJKwa,A finely tuned piece of gritty cinema,8,20 March 2019,"Fronted by a fierce and commanding performance from Nicole Kidman, who immerses both physically and mentally into the role of rogue police detective Erin Bell, Destroyer is an aptly titled look at finding justice for past wrongs no matter the personal cost.In embodying Bell, Kidman acts like an unpinned grenade tossing herself from confrontation to confrontation without a glimmer of fear. Her impulsive nature is the film's greatest strength as the bluntness of Kidman's performance is mesmerising. She expertly communicates the self-destructive tendencies of a woman pushed to her limits and like a train crash waiting to happen, it's hard to look away.Matching Kidman's unpredictable manner is the film's twisty screenplay that unfolds between Bell's time as an undercover agent in a Californian gang sixteen years ago to her present, coarsened self. As the film moves between timelines frequently, and with only cosmetic differences in Kidman's face to tell the difference, it occasionally becomes easy to get lost between the time shifts. However, as a reflection of how easily the past can come back to haunt the present in slight but damaging ways, the film succeeds with devastating effect.Taken as an ode to violent means having violent ends, Destroyer is a finely tuned piece of gritty cinema whose blunt force lingers long after the credits.",Destroyer

If she just stopped acting right now, moved back to Australia never to be seen again, that would be really ok with me. She gets together with crap writers and crap directing and crap producing and somehow thought she could pull this off. She's in the clouds with the other misguided out of touch Hollywood elites.

She still looks as good (and performs as well - better, even) as she did in ""Far and Away""... OMG!If you forced me to choose one outstanding beauty - which I hope you might do someday - I would nominate her, number one through five. Katherine Hepburn and Audrey Hepburn - maybe Julia Roberts - a few others come close, but for elegant, simple joy as a demonstration of the female form... Nicole.This is a gritty, existential crime drama with more than one explosive performance - including excellent exhibitions by Scott McNairy (again) and James Jordan (whom I don't know - watch for his aged last-pass ""interlude"" with Kidman's character, Erin). Even though the setting is LA, I found myself wondering if Ms. Kidman might be playing a role much more close to her original Aussie demeanor (had she not pursued her artform) than other characters she has portrayed.If you're looking for the soft, touchy-feely Kidman, fuggedaboudit. In the same script, as I said, she plays twenty to fifty like a TIME TRAVELER, but she ends-up HARD, as the title might imply. It's a burnout job for many, and she makes it real.As for the rest, you should watch. Definitely worth a spare hour or two.",Destroyer

Great storyline that flits back and forth in time with ease and no confusion, tightly directed and brilliantly edited.

It's not your usual movie where you can predict the scenes that will glorify the character. Instead, it doesn't scare away from making the character look uncool or beaten up, and it definitely doesn't do that half-heartedly, which makes the whole thing feel realistic. The plot is nothing new, it's your usual troubled detective who didn't come to terms with a past case. However, the handling of it is very different that it's refreshing. Nicole Kidman is in heavy, face altering make up which got my attention too much in the beginning but she's exceptionally good in fight scenes! Didn't see that coming! I felt pulled into the movie because of that...It's a tad bit long, especially the ending with long and dramatic scenes, but it's definitely worth a watch. Oh, and there's a twist!

I'll explain the problems.This film is all style over substance, so slow that they leave out important details about who characters are, such as 'Ethan'. Read reviews and they differ, which is pretty incredible confusion for a character who appears in the film for more than just a moment.The opening shot lures you in. An unrecognizable Kidman stumbles onto a crime scene and says she has an idea about the identity of the killer. And then you learn that a bad man has come back to town who was part of Kidman's distraught past. Kidman is off to investigate. And that in itself is confusing for reasons I won't explain here but is something the director (Kusama) should have realized.The script draws out a simple story over the course of 2 hours. Kidman's character is so over the top that you wonder how this zombie could have held a job for a month. There is absolutely no backstory. And that includes no backstory regarding a throwaway subplot involving her daughter. You could get rid of all of those scenes without being noticed, which shows how much filler they really are.After a good opening 1/3 of the film, somewhere along the halfway point the movie leaps off the rails. Kidman does something that is not credible which sets the entire film off kilter. Part of the problem is also confusion stemming from the opening scene, which makes the middle of the film seem like it is something which it decidedly is not. And only at the end, in a carefully crafted ""poetic"" scene do you try to piece together what you think has happened in a story told in various flashbacks.There really wasn't much here at all for 2 hours. Call it a super weak, wafer thin ""character study"" about a character you know almost nothing about, a story that has some continuity errors and no twists other than an uninentended one. As much as I liked the opening, I found the second half equally vapid and unredeeming.",Destroyer

The makeup (as many here have said) was a distraction. She looked like a zombie most of the time. Was she meant be be on Crystal meth? If so that was not clear at all. At one point when she was portraying a younger version of her character she had freckles that honestly looked like someone had plonked them over her face evenly spaced with a felt tip. The hair and makeup in this film were terrible.
The relationship with her daughter was hollow - at various times she managed to get her daughter to meet her and then proceeded to not really say anything to her. If I was the daughter I'd leave too. What was she doing out in the snow? In the script the daughter refers to her childhood which she can't remember even though it wasn't that long ago - this just made me think that the character's backstories on the whole were not developed properly so you felt nothing for anyone.

I could not find the Nicole Kidman I've watched over the years no matter how hard I looked, even in flashbacks where she's made to look much younger than her character's age. She is quite attractive in those flashbacks in stark contrast to her character's haggard and wasted look in the movie's present, which means she manages to switch between being a looker and a virtual bag lady all within the same movie. The topper is you can see the connection between the two women. As it happened I realized I can't think of any other actress who could have done the same.The story is a grim one and apparently not well liked by many, but I found it engrossing and very well produced.

It makes no sense, she's already an undercover FBI agent, at a young age, why wouldn't she be more than happy with the direction her life was headed? Yet she's willing to junk that for a few bucks? And her partner just goes along with it?Further, the entire idea that she would risk innocent lives, besides being disgusting is equally unbelievable. By definition, robbing this bank was not going to be a victimless crime, terrorizing people with big guns, but there were so many other ways it could go wrong. The gang leader is already shown to be unstable, what would have prevented him from killing people just because he felt like it? All it would take was someone with an itchy trigger finger, a security guard who decided to act like a hero, a nervous bank teller who went for the silent alarm, a customer to totally freak out, a police cruiser to show up by accident, and there would have been nothing but an entire bloodbath happening with her and her partner caught in the crossfire. Even a bad FBI agent might think maybe this might not be such a good idea.So as it turns out, dead partner, dead teller, money gone, bank robbers gone, and she feels bad about it after. Big deal.

It's like your watching a really really bad detective movie from the late 80s.I know there's a lot of garbage coming from Hollywood lately. But this movie is a whole new genre of garbage.A very slow paced boring/depressing movie.. it's painful to watch and it doesn't add anything of value to your mind. You'll leave the cinema feeling robbed of your precious leisure time as well as an a significant drop in your Intelligence Quotient.Save your precious money and don't go see this movie in the cinema. Because if you do, afterwards you wished you didn't and you'll hate yourself for it. So I'm just saving you the pain and agony I have to deal with right now.

168,michaelseither,Decent plot & twist - but miscast is miscast,5,12 February 2019,"No question Ms. Kidman is a really good actor. I'm sure she wanted to go outside her type-casting and show some range and do something diametrically different, for fun if nothing else. A heavy lead. A Dirty Harriet. Mumbling. Walking dead make-up without the racoon eyes. Bad decisions (her character's in the movie not hers for taking the role, sorry). Tough guyette. So for the movie to work you have to suspend disbelief and go with Ms. Kidman as a really tough cop who pistol whips people around. For me, the imagination leap is too great. I should go with the idea that Audrey Hepburn could mumble ""Make My Day"" through clinched lips holding a 44 Magnum in a perp's face and really, really put on a terrific acting job and I'd buy it. But I guess my imagination is limited. Sexist probably. I've seen Charlize Theron's attempts at this and I could get into it so I'm not sure it's totally sexist. Maybe Ms. Kidman felt she could carry it off, it Charlize could. Who knows? Maybe Charlize didn't employ the walking dead make-up? Anyway, it's worth seeing. Good production value. Good cast. Decent plot and twist. Check it out and form your own opinion.",Destroyer

Nicole Kidman (who is unrecognizable other than her tall frame) gives one of her greatest performances yet. Her chemistry with Sebastian Stan is fantastic and makes you understand why she is where she is now. The way she goes about solving the crime in this noir-thriller, is unrelenting, she is a character that is trying to do right by her child, but is so lost she doesn't know how. While you shouldn't feel bad for her character, you do, because Nicole is that. good. Big props to Karyn Kasuma, great direction, and the ending of this film is beautifully shot and completely heartbreaking.

Here, she delivers a deadpan performance which, along with the bad make up work and wig, makes me think a zombie from The Walking Dead could have done a better job.The lack of character development also contributes to the biggest problem with this film: no suspension of disbelief.You don't see an ex undercover cop: you see Kidman trying to look tough in a halloween costume. You don't get caught in a story: you see the director's vain efforts to create a smart film.

The cinematography is gorgeous and Nicole Kidman's performance is fantastic: as utterly convincing as the grim wrecked Erin Bell as she is the younger, sharper and more selfish version of herself in love with her partner Sebastian Stan.Modern day Erin has failed as a mother, as a cop, essentially at life, has abused her body to the point of collapse, but somehow she still smolders with some kind of internal energy - maybe it's her sixteen year old thirst for revenge? Either way, Kidman is a wonder to watch as she strides into every scene like some kind of vengeful limping grim reaper, pistol whipping anyone who stands in her way.I was really surprised to read so many people say the ending was somehow disappointing or anti-climactic, because - for me - it was a fantastic twist, that didn't really need the couple of flashbacks that made sense of it.

Exceptional.My wife did not like the film and reasonably pointed out the obvious screw-ups of the director that would seem to have been apparent at the story-board stage. For me, the main character was transcendent and I argue that it filling in some plot line voids with the hints of background diminishes plot distractions.I suspect that a few 100 grand more in budget or a few more days of time would have made this a better film. it seems pretty clear that ran out of one or the other.But whatever limits the producers had to deal with should not stop you from seeing a very gritty first-level striking performance on the big screen.

Nicole Kidman's makeup wasn't believable - False. Looks fine.2. Nicole Kidman's accent wasn't believable - False. No accent. Seriously whoever said Clint Eastwood must have meant Dirty Harry, but even then there was very little to complain about.3. The story was unbelievable - Disagree, but there are some questionable plot devices. Still don't make it unwatchable or decrease ability to suspend disbelief.All in all this was a pretty good movie. Some minor changes could have made it more tight but I was a fan up until the final, stupid, unnecessary sequence that spent about 10 minutes on unnecessary flashbacks and views of the protagonist dying in her car as we got closeups on skateboarding kids under an overpass.

No spoiler... this scenario and the way the scenes are ordered is not that bad.
What bugs me a lot are some critics calling that movie the best movie / role of Nicole Kidman ever. What? They seriously don't remember the Nicole KIdman we knew. The one before her rhinoplasty. And of course other many successful movies during her carrer. This one is far from being even a good one compared to all other productions. What bugs the movie is exactly the way she play that role. Playing a female human character like it was a dog all the time clearly ruins the desire to go farther in that story. Doing the same plan over and over to try to get the dog face from Nicole Kidman is totally stupid and really really anoying since it is always the same f.. face/expression she is doing all the time. In short really poor acting from Kidman and disturbing camera plans from the director. All other actors are doing a very great job compared to what she tried to do in there.

Here wear this wig, bad leather jacket and stagger around a little.Maybe it's a fine line between a sparse thriller and an overwrought plot trifle but this was definitely the latter. It was a 15 minute story stretched to 2 hours.I kept waiting for the plot development until I realized it was not going to arrive. The shots of LA were the movie equivalent of clip art.

She tries to find Silas (Head of Crime in which she was an undercover operation) to ensure that things are put to end once in for and all. In the meantime, she also have to take care of her teen daughter who's involved with wrong company.... The climax comes with a wonderful twist!!!What works well?Nicole Kidman: Particularly Nicole Kidman. You will find it pretty difficult to realise that it's Nicole Kidman in the opening scene. Her disheveled, tired, beaten, self destructive look steals the show along with an excellent performance - Infact, it's her career best performance and I wouldn't be surprised if she wins award. She's young, energetic in her younger self (in the flash back) and an exhausted cop at present. Mind blowing performance. She's the focus in every frame and she doesn't disappoint us
What did not work well?Slow, dragging, sleepy screenplay coupled with non-linear narration. It leaps between past and present but there's no distinction in dressing sense or camera (except for character appearances). Infact, I almost fell asleep before an action scene in 50th minute. They tried to follow the Sicario's screenplay style but I should admit it didn't fit/work well. Logically, why should Silas take 17 years to get back to her and he's not shown as a dreadful gangster to worry about!!!
There's a wonderful twist in the climax but that the movie, which runs for 2 hours, doesn't engage the audience to enjoy the twist.
Overall, it's a slow-paced wonderful movie for those learning the art. For a general audience who demands entertainment, it's not worth it!!!

202,niko-oinonen,"A great transformation by Nicole Kidman, not much more",6,1 March 2019,"Destroyer relies heavily on the physical transformation of Nicole Kidman. It is a story of a cop named Erin Bell (played by Kidman) who after an undercover job gone wrong has found her life to be in degradation. She has lost connection with her daughter and her former husband.It's an impressive transformation, that's for sure. Normally I've used to seeing Kidman as blond, but here she sports a dark brown hair. Her facial appearance is ragged and constantly weary. You'd might doubt if it's actually her, but thanks to some flashback scenes of the days before everything went bad, you can make out similarities and see that it is indeed her.Bell and her former partner infiltrated a criminal gang but something went wrong during a bank robbery and her partner died. Now the boss of the gang is back to clean up what's left. Well, at least that's the impression I got after Bell receives one of the bill from the bank job from mail. But he never really goes after her. Rather, it's her who goes after him. She meets some old faces from the gang, only now as a cop.The story is nothing surprising, in fact there doesn't seem to be enough of the old gang resurfacing to fill the two hours the film lasts since as a side story there's Bell's attempt to reconnect with her daughter who herself too has lost her way.Once in a while we get a flashback to the times when Bell and her partner were undercover. These scenes add some new elements to the story and to the character of Bell as to why they actually took part in the robbery. It's too bad that this part of the story is not explored as much as I would have wanted. Although the actual robbery is shown in the end, we don't see the aftermath of it. Maybe it's for the best as it allows the physical appearance of Bell to fill in the details.Story-wise there's a satisfactory, thematically everything nicely tying up moment in the end, however it's proceeded by an unexplainable urge of the film to attempt to be clever by forcing a twist that plays with the structures of storytelling. I won't spoil it, but I will say that it in no way impacts the story. It's just there for the sake of it being there. Sometimes it would be best just to end it with an emotional high note rather than forcing in a twist in the end, at least something as meaningless as this.",Destroyer

So the disappointment was even bigger when realizing how extremely boring and dull film this was. The story develops very slowly, the dialogues are dreary, the characters are uninteresting. I never watched Monster with Charlize Theron since she is far too beautiful to be molested by that make-up (this is not meant in a disrespectful way). I though I should give Kidman a chance, but the make-up is so bad and unrealistic, coupled with her walking around like drug addict; I felt betrayed. And the many close-up scenes do not make anything better. Even worse is it to watch the relationship between Kidman and her 16 year old daughter; I cannot understand how Kidman firstly took this part, and secondly why she deliberately delivers dialogues like the ones with her daughter.

222,silent_whispers,Pacing issues and too convoluted.,3,7 May 2019,"I feel like too many movies suffer from pacing issues. Movies are longer and too convoluted. Some of my favorite movies and some of the hey-day times of movies only needed 60 minutes to make magic. Sometimes 90 minutes. My ramble here is to say that Destroyer could have been brilliant. Yes, the moving is slow and winding. It's what the writer and director wanted. There's just so much extra junk that Destroyer shoots itself in the foot. I have no doubt that 60 minutes would have told this tale much better, and it still could have been ""slow"" feeling. Winding. Whatever.Honestly I feel like due to all of this Destroyer could easily be missed. However, unlike others I feel like this is Nicole Kidman's finest acting. Because she took a horrible irredeemable character and made you root for her. No really the character of Erin Bell is irredeemable. Erin Bell knows this and she embraces the awful she is whole heartedly. Kidman's skill made her likeable. Because the writing didn't really help her much, but she worked with what she had.Sebastian Stan-one of my favorite actors-is amazing! It pains me that he doesn't have more screen time. Not to mention that Sebastian Stan and Nicole Kidman had such amazing chemistry that I need for them to be in another movie together. (A good one please.)The cinematography is another amazing point of Destroyer that feels wasted. Though the biggest breakout role here is the makeup team and design teams. The music was forgettable, but worked well with the movie.Overall I feel that this movie wasted not only the amazing talent's of Sebastian Stan and Nicole Kidman, but many other well deserving actors. I hate a movie that wastes actor's talents. I always feel like it's the actors/actresses that get blamed when it's the script and director that needed some clean up and guidance. Overall I don't regret watching this to see the performances, but even that couldn't make this movie good or bearable.",Destroyer

I thought it was going to expose the gritty underground world of crime but instead it's a very generic bank heist gone wrong. Probably my fault for getting a bit too excited, especially after seeing Kidman's make-under.Her character is not redeemable at all..she's basically just a greedy cop, her boyfriend/police partner was the decent one of the two, he even gave his life to save the teller girl. Are we suppose to feel empathetic to Kidman's character or just come to the realization that she's not a good person. I know that may be how she's intended to be perceived especially considering she just straight up shots the gang leader at the end.It's too much of a slow paced drama and it's stale. None of the characters are given any screen time to develop. It's just the main protagonist walking around in constant pain and her speech is very low and mumbled (assuming from the booze). Everyone is praising Kidman but I did not see anything extraordinary. She looks the part but she doesn't show any emotion which leaves the viewers numb and unbothered whenever tragedy strikes.I did enjoy two scenes, I liked the intro scene that turns out it's the final scene.

I know it is written this way - for her character to make awful, selfish decisions and then suffer endlessly for them - but her entirely listless delivery bears not even a modicum of mirth. Surely there's SOMETHING that brings her relief? Investigating? Getting revenge? But the performance is so thoroughly depressing that the film is hard to watch.And how does her department allow her to work completely off the grid and without any oversight?And the endless scenes of driving, watching skateboarders, falling asleep in her car....the film could easily have been 30 minutes shorter - and that's not even touching on the needless never-ending flashbacks and flash-forwards. Perhaps telling the film chronologically would have made Kidman's performance more affecting - seeing the decline of the character into her mess of a life. The one flashback that gives the film a twist ending was good - but otherwise?

235,elizabeth-logan1,This movie sucked!,3,24 November 2018,First of all the story was convoluted when it didn't have to be. Secondly Nicole Kidman's aged character was way over-the-top and lacked any real substance and because of this her character distracted the viewer from the actual story being told. I've experienced more interesting stories in an episode of Law & Order SVU. In addition the person who did the make up for Nicole needed to be slapped in the face because it was so bad. There wasn't a need for her to wear that stupid wig and talk with that stupid Clint Eastwood vigilante accident. I spent most of this movie laughing at The stupidity or hoping it would end soon.

Nicole Kidman just CANNOT pull off the ageing alcoholic cop, it's painful to watch. The character arc is ridiculously skewed and more often than not you're wondering what is even going on? Who are those people? Why are so many side characters being introduced for NO REASON???
The plot is weak. For someone to hold a grudge and go on a 15 year downward spiral, you'd think something more concrete than a minor botched bank robbery could have been the basis of the plot.
The parallel past and present timelines only confuse you more. To be honest you don't know anything about any of the characters even AFTER the movie is over. It's got a horribly abrupt ending with a very confusing time overlap that seeks to explain itself in the last 5 minutes.

A grim neo-noir slow burner with a haunting and fierce performance from Nicole Kidman, who plays a devastated LAPD detective with nothing left to lose beyond her rage-filled vendetta. This film is sorta marketed as a revenge actioner a la Death Wish, but don't go into this expecting a high octane revenge flick-there's a lot more going on with its arduous non-linear narrative and layered main character. This is a dark, challenging film that takes its time as its broken deadeyed anti-heroine stumbles through LA's seedy criminal underworld on the scent for an elusive killer, but there's several satisfying bursts of bloody violence, scuzz, and excellent performances from Tatiana Maslany, Jade Pettyjohn, and Toby Kebbell. Kidman is definitely this film's strongest aspect, but it's totally worth your time if you dig grim neo-noirs, revenge films, and misanthropic detective tales. If I absolutely had to compare it to two other films, think Death Wish meets Department Q but with a gender role reversal and an original narrative twist. You won't love it, you probably won't hate it, but I bet you'll be gripped from start to finish. And if not, so be it, I dug it.",Destroyer

247,echaczyk,This would have made a great zombie movie,3,26 September 2021,"What a slow, plodding movie that makes its key star look like a three-day old zombie for no reason other than having young Kidman and old Kidman. Kidman's acting is almost non-existant except for a few scenes in flashback. First of all, Kidman's character Erin Bell is not a good person. Nobody in this film is good.It's a simple story of two undercover police officers, Erin and Chris (Kidman and Sebastian Stan) who infiltrate a Manson-type gang. Erin gets pregnant by Chris. The gang and its leader plan to rob a bank which by all accounts Erin and Chris should stop. But Erin talks Chris into doing the job and stealing the money, for their future child. The bank heist goes wrong, die packs are set-off and Chris and other people die. How there is no investigation and wrap up, I don't know. But skip forward 16 years and Erin looks like a zombie, again why? Was she punishing herself for 16 years? She receives through the mail a $100 bill covered with dye and knows that the Manson character has raised his head. Like 16 years before, he's planning another bank robbery and this time Erin and only Erin, will stop him. In the meantime, her daughter is dating a gang banger and living with her step-dad. Erin has some of the old bank job money, (again how) and uses it to pay-off the gang banger. Now instead of telling other police officers, Erin handles this alone and the new bank robbery goes down, people are killed and Erin finally gets the Manson type leader.A decent story that gets muddled down with lackluster acting, bad direction, bad dialog terrible pacing and very bad make-up. The story is told chronologically with flashbacks until the end. That's when the director adds a wrap-around. This movie was like watching bad paint dry. What happens makes no sense police procedure wise. How Erin keeps her job, looking the way she does makes no sense.

But this movie made me a bit disappointed. First of all, I think (we) the audience are being viewed as stupid, as if we couldn't tell how sad, lost and disappointed the female lead Erin is. Instead of giving us the background story and letting us realize how awful she must be feeling deep inside, you have so freakishly obviously overdramatized her look and her behavior, that she has almost become a caricature of her own character. Even though Nicole Kidman does a wonderful job and I was fully sucked into the story, there were moments when I just said ""comon, this is too much!"" Which brings me to my second remark, that is the portray of a strong independent woman, which you are trying to show us in the movie, but Erin is everything except a strong and independent woman! I think just because someone is depressed, and sad and lonely and lost and desperate, one doesn't have to walk around like a zombie, look like a wreck and have a constant bitter faces like sucking on a lemon. In my opinion the movie fails in this regard, I would have loved to see a healthy, organized, strong, feminine woman, who is just dying in the inside but is absolutely not visible on the outside.

This is a movie about the emotional, mental and physical toll on a female cop of an unfinished business.I myself had a difficult time getting through the film but the incredible performance of Nicole Kidman kept me glued on my chair. I was never distracted by the make prosthetic used to make Kidman look worn out, old and ugly. Her eyes conveyed so much of how utterly broken she was for what happened to her former partner. Those who said the movie is bad and Kidman did nothing more than plod around seriously cannot give an intelligible and objective review of the movie.The scene between Kidman and her daughter at the diner was so heartbreaking that you can clearly see and feel how she cared for her daughter.The risk taken by Kidman in diving into a dark character that was required to be in a dark place came as no surprise considering the reputation of Ms. Kidman of playing unconventional roles in unconventional films (Dogville, Birth, Fur, Paperboy, etc.).If the film was that bad, I would not have felt the heavy burden of the main character and the effective acting of Kidman.Flawed writing and direction, elevated by the Kidman's bruising performance by doing most of the heavy lifting.Although she was very deserving for an Oscar nomination, I wasn't surprised when she missed out.

Something bad happened almost twenty years ago and one of those involved is seeking closure. The end. Yet somehow they trudged through two hours of screen time to tell the story.I started awake, the wife faded in and out though mostly out. The camera work was bland if not repetitive with numerous tight shots on the star to justify the make up applications. The rest of the car is barely seen, there are barely even any extras, so it's mostly just two hours of Kidman playing a role that 20 years ago would have been (and may have been) played by Nick Nolte. A gruff, not by the book cop who drinks and abuses their badge while singularly focused on a single life changing event that was self inflicted in a way. I think it's supposed to be a pity picture, but at this point I don't care because the director made me that way.

Some of the scenes were action packed and brought the story to life. I did like how she had a rebellious teen daughter Shelby played by Jade Pettyjohn who didn't live the best life with her father being killed and her mom lying. It was interesting to find out that Kidman's character Bell was involved and responsible in the killing of her ex-husband, her daughter's father. I also liked the relationship that Erin had with Ethan very interesting. I did like the these parts of the movie what I was disappointed with is the lack of screen time Jade Pettyjohn got in this movie when watching the trailer it looked like she was going to be in at least quite a few scenes. She was only in 4 for 15 minutes of the 2 hour movie, once in a bar when Erin Bell (Kidman) notices her with an older guy who claims to be her boyfriend, another time when Erin talks to Shelby about her supposed boyfriend Jay and he stalks them, then when she was in the hospital after fracturing her wrist because she fought Jay's actual girlfriend realizing he was cheating on her, then when Erin apologized to her near the end about lying to her. I enjoyed these scenes with Pettyjohn and Kidman and wanted to see more of Pettyjohn since her character was so interesting! The other things that were disappointing were the constant flashbacks/repetitive scences where it showed Erin as a young cop and the troubles she had. The ending was also very confusing Erin tells Ethan that she loves him and it ends on another flashback with her and her daughter as a little kid going through the snow.

Most of the supporting performances are good, but there is one exception, and it is the film's major flaw: Toby Kebbell is simply not charismatic enough as the arch-villain.

Supporting cast are solid as well although the key character of Silas is somewhat underdeveloped it has to be said.That aside, I thought this worked really well, the flashbacks and jumping around means that you have to pay attention but things start falling into some kind of sense and it slow burns to the slightly startling conclusiom. The camera work is very good indeed, rich and bleached at the same time and all accompanied by a gorgeous score that adds dramatic tension.It's not really a heist movie, which is what I'd assumed from the trailer, nor is it a cop drama really, evem though we see Bell deep undercover as well as lurching around in the present day.

But if anything would have made my review go up by at least a couple of stars, it might have been casting anyone besides Nicole Kidman for this role. She was unable to embody the character and came off as more of a caricature. I found her drunken stagger to be amateur, her character development weak, her stiff upper lip far too reminiscent of Clint Eastwood. And do not get me started on that wig.Sadly, the plot is predictable, a good cop gone bad, but in a really bad way.

I was sceptical going in because of the mixed reviews this movie has been getting but I'm glad I gave it a shot.Destroyer is a slow burn, in the best sense of the term. If you are looking for a dark, immersive, hypnotic movie experience that pulls you into another world and allows you to walk a mile in the protagonist's shoes then look no further. All this is accomplished through an intoxicating mix of dreamlike cinematography, perfect pacing, an unnerving score and of course Kidman's riveting acting. And it's not just Kidman who is sans make-up, the city of LA is also portrayed in a warts and all manner adding to the grim and gritty feel of the movie thus hightening the verisimilitude. Add to this a plot that messes with the chronology just enough to keep you guessing without overdoing it to the point of confusion and you have one of the best movies I have seen in recent times.Those who complain about how slow, depressing and dark the movie is are missing the point it seems and are sad they stepped into a gourmet restaurant to find there's no chili dogs on the menu. Of course there's no accounting for taste but at some point you have to wonder how fair it is to judge a movie by standards that were never the intention of the filmmaker. I strongly feel that those knocking this movie have to look to themselves for the disappointing experience.

thus rendering her perhaps an unwittingly clandestine presence on the worlds stage and collective conscious.
Presently, and thankfully, outstanding female actors abound in our generation. Beholden, they are to be celebrated!
Kidman however, has an instinct (or an agent) that is spot on.
Nevertheless, I believe she is a Revelation. Or as we seasoned musicians say , a ""Scary Monster"". Much revered but oh so under the radar (jaw dropping talent).In terms of her acting prowess, I cannot ponder her peer nor a similar persona having had such an almost overlooked affect..ever.After walking 9 kilometers in the rain without a map in Berlin to see the last of the movie showings, it was beyond my expectation.

It was never shown to the viewer how she supposedly got in this supposedly horrible condition where she walks as though she has crapped her pants. Why are her teeth rotten? She's an alcoholic but is only shown drinking one drink maybe twice. Huh? Poor character development. Gruff scratchy voice comes and goes, but she's at least consistently raggedy (when it's not a flashback).Constant timeline shifts.

325,kurtis-65528,Great movie - no action film,9,31 August 2019,"Not a standard cop-film, but a good story with character, and profound human, depth. Plot develops (intentionally) slowly but opening all kind of options. A great different piece and superb performance.
A dark movie and definitely nothing for a joyful light evening. It contains a few action scenes, but is certainly not an action film. It won't be near everyone's favourite. Makes it even better.",Destroyer
326,maximax-86531,Destroyed 2 hrs of my life,2,25 February 2019,I don't recommend anyone to see this disaster. Doesn't Nicole Kidman read scripts before she takes a leading role? Plot is horrid and the storytelling is linear and unbelievable stupid. Slowest and dullest movie I've seen in many years. Even the mule shines compared to this one. Give me my money back.,Destroyer
327,samrforster,"Gritty and raw, devoid of any sentimentality",8,7 February 2019,"Kidman plays the broken and haunted detective brilliantly. The timeline goes full circle and delivers an excellent plot which never gets too deep or over sensationalises. Kidman's character is literally broken beyond repair and in her mind beyond redemption. As she seeks to fix the things she's done wrong The other characters in the film are subordinate to her story line, the story is her story, not the fellow cops, her daughter, her lover and her nemesis, all of whom dip in and out of the narrative but never with any real depth or solo scene. Well worth a watch.",Destroyer

329,carapooz,Nicole Kidman plays badly,1,8 March 2019,"Nicole Kidman plays poorly in this film. This role is not for her. Makeup is badly done.

Everything builds up to the event that broke her as a character and when they finally showed it, I had enough and left. Just couldn't take it anymore. Here's every scene in the movie:'Give me the info I need to move the plot along'
'No'
'Give it to me'
'No'
'GIVE IT TO ME'
'Ok'

331,commenaanita,Destroyer boasts a stellar performance from Nicole Kidman,8,23 April 2019,"Nicole Kidman shatters all expectations and breaks hearts with her relentlessly fierce performance as a depraved undercover LAPD detective on a slippery trail of retaliation, redemption and suicide in Karyn Kusama's intensely told cop drama.",Destroyer
332,jeancoetser,Worst movie I've seen in my life.,1,21 March 2019,"The movie was lots and lots of hard work with dreadfully long and boring scenes and a horrible storyline.

I have so much to say about this movie but it just seems like a waste of time I would probably want to qualify my thoughts for the purpose of stopping someone from wasting their time but I probably won't convince you. If you're a Goodfellas fan or perhaps a pulp fiction Fan this isnt your movie.

338,londoc,Hard to find but worth it!,8,29 January 2019,"Nicole Kidman's transformed appearance first caught my attention and has been the main buzz about the film, but there is a solid performance behind that. Destroyer has a rawness to it that brought me right into it. I was frustrated when Erin was, was angry when she was, was disappointed when she was.Definitely worth seeing, but this film is hard to find. I live in the Boston area and had to wait for it to show up at 2-3 screens. After seeing it I looked to go back and now it's down to one, 25 miles away. I'll make the trip!!",Destroyer

340,grant_sutherland,"Good, but not great",7,21 March 2019,"Destroyer is good, but not great. It's grim, gritty, and at times feels very unpleasant. But it is a reasonable example of neo-noir. Kidman carries herself well throughout the film, both as the present-day beaten and broken LAPD detective, and in flashback as the young undercover sheriff recruited by the FBI to infiltrate a violent group of bank robbers. As with most film noir, Kidman is more antihero than hero, seriously damaged by her past, and hopelessly conflicted by her present. Destroyer is slow-paced, in the way of much noir, but never feels plodding or, except for the very end, stretched out. And there is an interesting chronological twist at the end that adds an extra dimension.",Destroyer
341,wildwindstrading,Clear eyed review,2,12 February 2019,"I don't know why I watched this movie till the end. Nicole does not do well. The attempt to make her look like a time worn drunk completely ignores her eyes..
Since when does some one on a bender with no sleep have clear sparkling eyes. Not bloodshot, not even looking weary. It is the worst character make up I have ever seen and it makes her unbelievable acting even more so.",Destroyer

343,mturner717,A 10 but for two things,8,12 July 2020,"I don't understand the haters on this film, especially those complaining about the non-lineal timeline, with some even saying they couldn't tell the difference in flashbacks and current time. Did we watch the same film? Were you wearing your glasses? Perhaps Disney is a better option to consider next time.This is an excellent drama about how unresolved trauma, anger, pain, etc is just as deadly as any metastasized cancer. You can see its pain on the faves of Erin, Shelby, and Ethan. You can see it even in the way Erin walks, shuffling like her shoes weigh 20# each.Ms Kidman has shown increasing bravery in the last few years in the roles she takes and how imperfect the characters are, inside and out. In Destroyer she's completely unrecognizable except for her piercing blue eyes and her more than occasional drop into her Aussie accent. This is distracting and frustrating that such a high caliber actress can't pull off a passable American accent for 2 hours (-1).Speaking of 2 hours, this film is about 15 minutes too long (-1). The memory the daughter recounts of being lost in the snow storm is appropo of nothing unless it's to give Erin credit for making her daughter feel safe. Then Erin's remembrance of it (still without explanation of its relevance) overlaid with random skateboarders while she's dying just feel odd and distracting",Destroyer
344,princess-swanie,Wasn't what I expected,6,10 April 2019,Not saying it was a terrible movie but it was definitely not what I expected. Sebastian Stan was barely in the movie.

347,nicklong67,Truer Grit,8,8 February 2019,"I totally dug it. Nicole was awesome. All of the acting was great. I've been reading a lot of the reviews on here, and they're knocking the makeup... I dunno, I thought they did a great job of making Nicole Kidman look exhausted and like she's been drinking, going undercover and stressing over solving mysteries for decades. I've read ppl talking about her ""walking like a zombie""... Yeah. What's wrong with that? She must've gotten way into character, because she plays an irate alcoholic to a tee. I thought the antagonist was well played and eerily chilling. I walked out right before the end... because I would've pissed my pants if I hadn't. It was a tough decision to make. It reminded me of True Detective, the less flattering depiction of detective work and the personal turmoils it takes. It isn't a job, it's a passion. It's masochism. I was excited to see it and very much not disappointed. There's a good twist but, in my opinion, the style outweighs the story. The score might have been my favorite part, and that's saying a lot. 8 stars!",Destroyer

354,Another_Critic,Do your homework,1,25 November 2018,"This film indicates that Kidman is an LAPD Detective, however in the trailer it shows a personnel file of her wearing a sheriff deputy's uniform. To any film maker, when making a movie about LAPD please go out and get a technical advisor that perhaps worked for LAPD so you can avoid the embarrassment.",Destroyer
355,loriel-61636,Awful,3,28 January 2019,"To begin, the makeup artist should be banned from working in movies. The gorgeous Nicole looked more like a possessed Linda Blair than a wrecked, revenge possessed detective.
The movie jumped between the past and present in a very uneven confusing way.
The characters were unsympathetic and under developed.
It was slow and not very engaging. You can't quite figure out what her life was in between the initial tragedy and the present. What was up with Ethan? Her daughter? Did she ever shower? Why does she talk like Clint Eastwood and walk like a zombie?
My first comment when it ended was ""Why the hell was she in the woods in a storm with her 7 year old daughter?"" My final comment was ""I actually don't care.""",Destroyer

362,ken-03422,Excellent,8,16 April 2019,I really didn't have to concentrate that hard to get the plot straight as some people complained about. It makes a change to not have a story line handed on a plate and all the more interesting to have to put just a little effort in and join the dots. Nice direction and a fabulous performance from Kidman. Dark and well rounded characters,Destroyer
363,kfolsen,Kidman Kudos,6,24 April 2019,"Nicole Kidman does in fact deliver an accomplished performance in Destroyer. Yes, the movie tends to move somewhat slowly and would be misrepresented as an action/adventure feature. But Kidman triumphantly carries the film with a masterful portrayal of a character that is strikingly different than expected, and in the process dramatically expands and enhances her reputation as an actress.",Destroyer
364,bakerjr,The cast is fantastic,10,15 December 2018,"The performances in this film are incredible. Nicole Kidman, Sebastian Stan, and Tatiana Maslany are all outstanding and take advantage of every second of their screen time. Nicole Kidman stands out though, and was able to create a character filled with sorrow, regret and desperation. Kidman makes you feel all of those feelings right along with her.
The director and cinematographer coordinated really well on this film to create an atmosphere that is enthralling and tragic and the locations and sets chosen perfectly show the depravity and misery that is the backdrop for most of the film.
I hope this film, the actors, and director receive the attention they deserve.",Destroyer
365,fromthedarknessbook,Too slow,2,12 February 2019,"Thought this would be a great cop thriller with Nicole Kidman being a gritty detective. Turns out it was a slow meander through poor storytelling and Kidman being gritty but depressing. They should have chopped the flashbacks and added more action. If this is Kidman doing a Neeson or even Penn, it was poorly conceived",Destroyer
366,higgy-97243,Sleeper Bad Cop/Revenge Movie!,7,18 June 2019,"Much like Charlize Theron in Monster, this film takes Kidman out of her comfort zone (of being beautiful and playing attractive characters). She delivers a gut wrenching, albeit a bit over the top, performance. I don't think Kidman is over acting, she just gets too many close ups. A small distraction. The overall direction showed vision and grit. There are no easy answers or sappy sound tracks here.The rest of the not so well known Actors are all stellar. And perfectly casted. I found the pace deliberate and well done, at times I was on the edge of my seat (I didn't find this slow, unless you need more CGI action garbage to hold your attention).I loved the depiction of the criminal drug culture of days gone by. And the plot was imaginative. A refreshing change of pace from the predictable crap coming out of Hollywood these days.",Destroyer
