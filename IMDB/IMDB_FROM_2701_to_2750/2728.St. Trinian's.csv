0,TheLittleSongbird,"Entertaining film, yes with flaws, but at least it entertains",6,11 October 2009,"St Trinian's is neither a great movie or a terrible movie. It is an entertaining one, and I respect the fact, it wasn't trying to make itself a classic. It is constantly silly, but the performances from all involved make it a fun film to watch. The film does have a great soundtrack, and there are some very funny moments. The film does have its flaws, it is predictable, and the film's structure is rather episodic. The film's pace is a little uneven in places too. However, the script is sharp and witty, and the performances are delightful. Rupert Everett especially gives a stellar performance in the title role, and Colin Firth plays it straight as the Government Minister. All the girls are charming and likable, and the supporting turns from Stephen Fry, Anna Chancellor, Toby Jones, Celia Irmrie and Russell Brand(despite the dreadful German accent he had in one scene) are all fun. All in all, has its flaws, but entertaining nonetheless. 6.5/10 Bethany Cox",St. Trinian's
1,SnoopyStyle,Wild and wacky tween girl movie,6,27 July 2015,"Annabelle Fritton (Talulah Riley) is dumped by her father to her aunt Camilla Fritton (Rupert Everett), headmistress of the wild and crazy St. Trinian's School for Young Ladies. Kelly Jones (Gemma Arterton) is the streetwise Head Girl. Flash Harry (Russell Brand) is the black market connection for the girls. Education Minister Geoffrey Thwaites (Colin Firth) aims to clean up the school system and he's starting with St. Trinian. His daughter Verity (Lucy Punch) is the bully Head Girl of a rival school and he is Camilla Fritton's ex. Miss Dickinson (Lena Headey) is the new English teacher.It's a lot beautiful and sometimes scantily clad school girls in wild and crazy antics. I'm not sure why Rupert Everett is cross dressing here but it's not funny. Russell Brand is enjoying himself with the wild character. If there is a cruder and sillier way to tell a joke, this movie will find it. It's also a lot of screaming girls. I think most people will be a little annoyed by it all after awhile but girls may find female empowerment in these girls taking matters into their own hands. There's even a multi-makeover montage.",St. Trinian's
2,jboothmillard,St. Trinian's,5,30 November 2011,"At the time of its release this was a sort of largely advertised British film, and I may have seen it mentioned on Film 2007 with Jonathan Ross, and it is based on a bunch of original films in a series, I had to see what the fuss was. Basically St. Trinian's is the all girls boarding school in London, England that proudly boasts itself as the rock bottom and unacceptable face of British education, allowing bad behaviour, bad teaching and uncontrollable stuff for the troublesome girls who attend, but not everyone knows this information. The latest girl to join the school is Annabelle Fritton (Talulah Riley), daughter of Carnaby Fritton (National Movie Award nominated Rupert Everett), who is the brother of the dotty school headmistress Camilla Fritton (also Everett), she is at first like a fish out of water, but after a while she does fit in. The school is facing bankruptcy and closure unless things improve, and personally having a look around seeing that things improve is the new Minister of Education, Geoffrey Thwaites (National Movie Award nominated Colin Firth), who didn't realise Miss Fritton was the headmistress, she is his old flame. The students are planning a way to try and get the money they need to keep the school open, with the help of con artists and master robbery guy Flash (Russell Brand), they are planning to steal the painting made famous by Scarlett Johansson, the Girl with a Pearl Earring. They plan to do this on the night when St. Trinian's is taking part in a television school quiz, like University Challenge, hosted by Stephen Fry, playing against Cheltenham Ladies' College, they are doing it in the building the painting is hanging, and in the end they do save the day selling it off. Also starring Quantum of Solace's National Movie Award nominated Gemma Arterton as Kelly, Venus's Jodie Whittaker as Beverly, Atonement's Juno Temple as Celia, Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps' Kathryn Drysdale as Taylor, Antonia Bernath as Chloe, Amara Karan as Peaches, Keeping Mum's Tamsin Egerton as Chelsea, Doctor Who's Lily Cole as Polly, singer Paloma Faith as Andrea, Holly Mackie as Tara, Cloe Mackie as Tania, Celia Imrie as Matron, Doctor Who's Fenella Woolgar as Miss Cleaver, 300's Lena Headey as Miss Dickinson, Doctor Who's Toby Jones as Bursar, Casino Royale's Caterina Murino as Miss Maupassant, Dinner for Schmucks' Lucy Punch as Verity Thwaites, Four Weddings and a Funeral's Anna Chancellor as Miss Bagstock, Lenny in Pieces' Steve Furst as Bank Manager, Mischa Barton as JJ French, The Haunted Mansion's Nathaniel Parker as Chairman of the National Gallery and Girls Aloud (Cheryl Cole, Nadine Coyle, Sarah Harding, Nicola Roberts and Kimberley Walsh). The all British of young stars and the older recognisable ones all do well, the story is reasonably simple, and most of the slapstick, cross dressing and dialogue gags do make you chuckle a fair amount, so overall this a surprisingly good return from a formerly successful series of films, a fun family comedy. It was nominated the National Movie Award for Best Comedy. Worth watching!",St. Trinian's
3,Tweekums,An anarchic school comedy,7,29 May 2012,"The opening scenes introduce us and new girl Annabelle Fritton to St. Trinian's School for girls; it isn't like other schools the pupils run the place. Having come from the prestigious Cheltenham Ladies' College Annabelle is initially not impressed with the anarchy she finds in St. Trinian's but grows to fit in; especially after she learns that her father wants to have the place shut down and sold off. The school already owes half a million pounds to the bank so it looks as if it will close if the girls can't think up a way to get the money. They have an idea but if they are to have a chance they will have to get to the finals of an inter-school TV quiz because it will be filmed in the National Gallery and the picture they plan to steal is in there! It doesn't help of course that a new government minister wants to improve the education system, starting with St. Trinian's!I had heard some fairly negative things about this film but was determined to watch it with an open mind; I was soon chuckling and found plenty to laugh out during its hour and a half run time. It never took itself too seriously and the cast were a lot of fun to watch; Talulah Riley did a good job as protagonist Annabelle and even though she was a bit old to be playing a school girl Gemma Arterton was a lot of fun as head girl Kelly. There were plenty of well known British stars in the cast including Colin Firth, Rupert Everett, Celia Imrie and Russell Brand amongst the cast as well as a number of unknowns. The story was of course very silly but then it wouldn't have been St. Trinian's if it hadn't been. The first half of the film where we are being introduced to the school and seeing the minister's attempts to show the press how bad it is was the funniest; when it got to the art robbery the jokes slowed down a bit and the producers felt it necessary to show that under their act they were not bad girls which is a pity as half the fun of St Trinian's is that they are meant to be bad! Overall I thought this was a lot better than expected and should provide a decent number of laughs.",St. Trinian's
4,studioAT,Easy enough viewing,3,18 October 2017,"With the cartoons and original films as a starting point this re-imagining of the St Trinian's world was well welcomed by audiences upon this film's release.It boasts a game cast of big names (Colin Firth, Rupert Everett) all giving it a good go, and there's some nice laughs along the way.It's not a masterpiece, but for an hour and a half's entertainment this is good fun.",St. Trinian's
5,hitchcockthelegend,Ooh err missus.,7,19 February 2015,"When it was announced that there was to be a modern reboot of St. Trinian's, it was met with Luke warm murmurings to say the least. Yet when it comes down to it, the old films from the 50s and 60s were hardly comedy gold anyway. Safe family fare and sometimes fun into the bargain, and with strong casts, they have never been seen as essential British comedies and untouchable by the modern era's obsession with remakes and reimaging.St. Trinian's 2007 style is not an improvement on the oldies, but neither is it the stinker some critics in 2007 wanted us to believe. It has enough about it to be its own animal, it's funny, sexy and never dull. This also benefits from strong comic casting, where the likes of Rupert Everett (having the time of his life in drag), Colin Firth and Russell Brand are pitched into the femme madness headed by Gemma Arterton and Tallulah Riley. The writers err on the side of caution as far as risqué material goes, but there's some very strong gags played out and the grouping of the girls into the various cliques (Emos, Chavs etc) is a nifty bit of writing that is mined to good effect.It was good enough and successful enough to warrant a sequel 2 years later 6.5/10",St. Trinian's
6,neil-476,Good fun,7,29 December 2011,"There was a short run of films in the 50s and 60s based on Ronald Searle's wonderful cartoons of St Trinians, a school populated by girls ranging from the short and stout to the tall and leggy, linked by fishnet stockings and a generally ratty state of dress. Their behaviour is not good, but tends towards the naughty rather than the wicked. And the staff are, if anything, worse.And now, 40 years later, the school puts in another appearance. Head teacher Camilla Fritton is played by Rupert Everett in drag (Alistair Sim did likewise in the 50s) in a nod to the past. In fact, the film does a good job of remaining faithful to the premise of the past while updating the trimmings.The story doesn't matter: suffice it to say that the girls are up to no good. They are well cast, and it is interesting to see a number of careers in their very early days (Gemma Arterton, Juno Temple, Tamsin Egerton etc.). It is also a joy to see Colin Firth playing it straight while wickedly sending up his Pride And Prejudice image.There is a ramshackle air to this movie, but that hangs over from the original St Trinians and suits the movie well. It is fun, and entertaining from start to finish.",St. Trinian's
7,gradyharp,The Brits Don't Do This Genre Very Well,2,1 January 2011,"ST. TRINIAN'S seems like an awful bust, unless the extremes of slapstick and borderline taste are your bailiwick. It is a film that comes across as a cartoon that never can get out off the page - what one would expect when the 'writer' is a committee (Piers Ashworth, Jamie Minoprio, Nick Moorcroft, Ronald Searle (!), and Jonathan M. Stern) and the direction is shared (Oliver Parker and Barnaby Thompson). St Trinian's is 'school' for dysfunctional girls (nerd to goth) run by a wild headmistress Camilla Fritton (Rupert Everett in bucktoothed drag plus fuddy English gent's clothes as Carnaby Fritton). The school is a major disaster zone and one Geoffrey Thwaites (Colin Firth) is sent to correct the issues. The threat of bankruptcy spins its own dire consequences and the 'inmates' of the school find a way to correct that. The major surprise is not in the plot but instead in the fact that some of Britain's finest actors agreed to participate in this mess: Rupert Everett, Colin Firth, Lena Headey, Toby Jones, Anna Chancellor, Celia Imre, etc etc could have their choice of about any film casting and win Oscars and kudos instead of boodos. It gives pause...Grady Harp",St. Trinian's

9,JamesHitchcock,"Not for acceptable, respectable, presentable vegetables.",6,4 April 2021,"Ronald Searle's cartoons about the girls of St Trinian's School have inspired a number of comedy films, dating back to ""The Belles of St. Trinian's"" from 1954. The stories are set in a British girls' boarding school, and the basic joke is that the girls, far from being sweet and innocent, are all juvenile delinquents inclined to violence and dishonesty. Generally speaking, the younger a St Trinian's girl is, the worse her behaviour. The staff obviously take a permissive view of their responsibilities as educators, as they make little if any attempt to restrain the girls' anarchic tendencies.This film dates from 2007, making it the sixth entry in the series and the first since ""The Wildcats of St Trinian's"" in 1980. The school owes £500,000 to the bank, and the St Trinian's girls decide to steal Vermeer's ""The Girl with a Pearl Earring"" from London's National Gallery so that they can pay off the debt. (In reality, of course, yhis painting is not in the National Gallery but in the Mauritshuis in The Hague).The school is also being investigated on account of its low educational standards by a tough new Minister of Education, Geoffrey Thwaites, who turns out to be a former boyfriend of the headmistress, Camilla Fritton. Miss Fritton is played by a male actor, Rupert Everett, who also plays Camilla's brother, the dodgy art dealer Carnaby Fritton. (Thwaites is played by Colin Firth, who also acted together with Everett in ""Another Country""; there is a hidden allusion to this in the dialogue). The headmistress was also played by a male actor, Alastair Sim in the first two films in the series, although female actors took the role in the intervening episodes.The first four entries in the series were regular fixtures on British television during my childhood and teenage years, and I recall enjoying them at the time, but as it is a long time since I last saw any of them I will not attempt a direct comparison with the 2007 episode. (I have never seen ""The Wildcats..."" which came out while I was at university). ""St Trinian's"" is clearly a film which divides opinion. Those allergic to bad language and sexual references would be well advised to steer clear, and I see that the Mrs Grundy tendency are out in force on this board, pointing out that the girls of St Trinian's are not good role-models for the nation's youth. (Really!)Which, of course, is why I enjoyed it. When I was a child, and even more when I was a teenager, nothing was more guaranteed to kill a film stone-dead than the suspicion that my elders and betters were using it to force good role-models on me. Which doubtless explains why my favourite reading included Richmal Crompton's ""Just William"" (a bad role-model if I ever read about one) and the books Searle wrote with Geoffrey Willans about Nigel Molesworth, the male equivalent to the St Trinian's girls. It also explains why I liked the original St Trinian's films so much. I may now be an adult, but I still feel that childhood and youth should be a time for joyful free spirits. There is plenty of time in adult life to turn into what Supertramp would have called an acceptable, respectable, presentable vegetable.Yes, ""St Trinian's"" is never going to be anyone's idea of a masterwork of the British cinema, but there is a marvellously over-the-top double-act from Everett, countered by a marvellously po-faced performance from Firth. I have never been a great fan of the comedian Russell Brand, but here he is perfectly acceptable as the spiv Flash Harry (a character originally created by George Cole), leaving at the door his normal tendency to take himself too seriously. Strangely, it was the performances from the actors playing adults which most stood out, the girls being played not s much as individuals but as representatives of the various cliques- geeks, emos, posh totty, chavs- to which they belong. ""St Trinians"" may be nonsense, but at least it is refreshingly anarchic enjoyable nonsense. 6/10.",St. Trinian's
10,didi-5,"""another country""",5,29 December 2007,"I saw the trailers and read some of the reviews of this before going to see it with some trepidation. Rupert Everett as the headmistress seemed a good choice but the girls looked too old and too obvious and the charm and fun of the original films was lost in smut and nastiness. From the start as the chavs, posh totty, goths, emos and others were introduced I thought 'uh oh' and didn't hold out much hope.Five stars for Everett's punchy Camilla Fritton and her delicious sparring with Colin Firth's education minister, with devious little nods to their previous work together; for Mr Darcy, and for the Girl with a Pearl Earring joke. But nothing else, even the planned robbery during a school quiz on telly, really works, and the theme song from Girls Aloud is just shocking.This film does not dim memories of Alistair Sim - in fact, his portrait adorns the fireplace in Miss Fritton's office. And without Sim, Joyce Grenfell and the rest, this St Trinian's is a poor imitation.",St. Trinian's
11,johnnyboyz,An insight into a term at a school you'll wish you hadn't stumbled across.,4,17 October 2009,"There was an article-come-interview, around about the time Sex Lives of the Potato Men was released in 2004, in which the director of said film defended his piece with the notion that for a crowd wanting to turn up; sit back; crack open a lager and enjoy a gross-out comedy revolving around the sorts of people you may or may not see on screen as yourself in terms of social class and profession – the film worked. The makers of that film would argue everyone is allowed a film 'for them', so to speak. St. Trinian's is a curious case; it's a film that exists purely for girls aged between 12 and 17, for anybody else it'll probably be a turgid chore, as was the above mentioned example. Whatever audience card you want to play, it doesn't mask the fact that, from an entirely subjective point of view, your film has the ingredients to be an absolute stinker. The intended audience for this may well see themselves on screen; they may well be able to relate to some predicaments, but whether it will do them any good in the long run is debatable.As it happens, St. Trininan's is the chore that was expected. A messy and sporadic effort, a film that encompasses tired references to films of recent decades; 'funny' continental European accents; homophobic jibes and cross dressing characters; contemporary 'words' that are actually mere abbreviations (LoL and OMG, for instance) as well as.............dog humping jokes. Poor Gemma Arterton; she makes this drivel prior to starring in Quantum of Solace; sees it get released in Britain; sees it get buried and hopes that's the end of it but only for it to recently come out in America now that she's a name and a face thanks indeed to her Bond escapades.I think the film wants to be a documentation of how a young girl, whom does not immediately fit in with the system, comes to earn the respect of her peers by way of team-work and encouraging the group to act as individuals to overcome a greater obstacles; in this film's case, potential bankruptcy. What it ends up being is a maddening, sprawling mess of a film that offers nothing on what it's like to live in contemporary England as a young girl/woman; doesn't deal with any of the issues revolving around beginning at a new school or the stresses and strains of going to a boarding school or even the somewhat awkward time we've all felt when making new friends is the order of the bill. St Trinian's just wants to have fun; it wants to by pass most things and opt for dumb sight gags and gross out humour – the trivialisation of most of the above ideas is frightening.The film sees young woman Annabelle Fritton (Riley) being dumped off at the titular school by her father. She quickly comes to realise this is no ordinary school; with an altercation with hidden cameras, YouTube accounts and shower sessions the early events that, not only lack any sort of humour at all, but set up a certain leeriness the film carries throughout. During all this; we are introduced to head girl Kelly, a waltzing; school-uniform-clad Gemma Arterton and another character named Flash Harry – who's sort of a cross between Brad Pitt's character from 2000's Snatch, in terms of clothes, and Only Fools and Horses' Derek Trotter in terms of speech and mannerisms. Along with these two, there is a smattering throughout of girls of varying ages, in a silly attempt to reach out to all possible audiences, and a number of tired and vacuous scenes including, but not limited to, ten year old girls making 'The Italian Job' references: a film they, and the intended audience, probably haven't even seen.Cut to the villain of the hour, a stern-faced Colin Firth starring as Geoffrey Thwaites, a politician desperately wanting to reinvigorate the educational system, something that engulfs exploiting the St. Trinian's we all know and 'love' as an example to other schools of what 'not' to do. He sits in an office over looking Tower Bridge and talks all nasty to his suit-clad chums. On top of all this, it turns out the school owe a substantial amount of money to the bank and face closure. The rendering of a politician as the villain, or 'bad guy' is a cheap, cheap shot on the film's behalf. The ideas linked to the fact there is one sane enough character able to identify St. Trinian's as a 'bad' school in which incorrect beliefs and attitudes are apparent is an interesting one, but one that is switched so that the audience are meant to embrace both the pupils of St. Trinians' attitudes and ways of life as they unite against this common enemy. Also, the film is so redundant of any sense that we are lead to believe this 'anarchy' and chaotic way of schooling oneself will actually lead you to success.The girls at this school are technically very efficient and their abilities to set up close circuit cameras and electrical devices in practically any area are frighteningly daft. With the above premise established, the picture veers off into a pseudo-heist film in which crime and stealing is made to look fun, or glamorous, while cheating on a television quiz show is established as quite clearly the thing to do – shame on those who thought these ideas and messages were the way to go in putting across daft, camp entertainment to young girls between 12 and 17. There's an instance, which really captures the stupidity of the film, in which head girl Kelly herself states she might have an issue with two ten year old girls, armed with explosives, going into the sewers in order to gain access to an area – but no one seems bothered and it carries on. St. Trinian's is full of the wrong ideas, done very badly.",St. Trinian's
12,leplatypus,Lena at the anarchy school (rental),4,10 December 2013,"This comedy is typically British as this school breaks all traditions. That's why in France, this can't be done because french people have already erased traditions during the french revolution back in 1789. Today, when we do funny movies at school, it's mostly about cheating the exams.The other good thing here is the unexpected reunion of the best British cast for such crazy characters! If the newcomer who plays young Fritton is also good and has the same reaction that myself at 10 when feeling trapped (a late night call to the parents), the same can't be said about poor Lena. She's playing a funny shy and old fashioned teacher but her part is totally cut. The deleted scenes show that she was more involved and also that all those cuts were essential to add oil to a rather rusty narrative.That's the very black hole of this movie as the story isn't very interesting. The idea to steal a painting to finance the school helps to discover the national gallery but it's too ""mission impossible"" for me. In conclusion, as long as the movie focus on the students and happens in school, it's funny but as they got out, it's a bit dull. My Grade: C+ with the mention ""can do better""!",St. Trinian's
13,RavenGlamDVDCollector,"uh-oh we're in trouble, we're deep in doodoo and we haven't got a shovel",8,15 March 2016,"I struggled watching it at first, I missed a whole lot of what was actually said, and I refuse to use subtitles on the virgin flight. I felt that the characters made too little impression on me, they're not likable, and the whole thing was kinda over the top simply for the sake of being over the top. Then, a bit before nearing the halfway mark came that song that beautifully fitted in with the theme and tied everything up with a nice bow.Uh-oh, we're in trouble Something's come along and it's burst our bubbleAnd it is just so damn cute that it made me see the whole flick in a positive new light! There is an absolute wealth of detail. The film oozes surprises popping up in the backgrounds. There is such an absolute lot going on here, the flick gets an A+ for effort, heart and spirit. The pupils are a deranged lot. Everybody is busy as beavers being deeply anti-social, except those at the wrong end of the stick.After the song warmed my heart, I was more in tune with the movie. These misfits have to be cheered for! And the subtitles were, of course, finally used, and there aren't complaints from me anymore. Movie has a cult following, and I can see why.A better title : GIRLS TOGETHER. Or ST. TRINIAN'S GIRLS TOGETHER. I just realized how much it would be misunderstood. But meant by me in the sense of 'standing together overcoming all opposition'... Movie has a cartoonish* style with a deluge of over the top characters. Including Rupert Everett in a dual role, which is kinda ludicrous to the extreme, a whole troop of little savage girls, some of them horrid little white-faced Goths (or Satanists?) :) and bigger girls wielding hockey sticks like deadly weapons. Also a little leg-humping dog. *Inspired by the works of Robert SearleBy the way, just learned scant minutes ago re ST.

14,jaybob,"The original film was a laugh riot, current film is very , very funny & enjoyable.",9,12 February 2010,"I 1954 I was at a sneak preview, I had expected another film, I almost left until I saw who was the lead actor, Alistair Sim & he was in full drag. That was enough to make me stay. 55 years ago I saw a hilariously funny farce. Last night I saw a very funny farce.The Belles of St.Trinians (1954) spawned 2 or 3 sequels all starring the great comic actor Alistair Sim.All these years later we have the excellent actor Rupert Evereett doing this very funny dual characters. Colin Firth costars & of course he is equally great. These 2 actors make a good team,they have been in a number of films together.Stephen Fry another very funny comic actor is the quiz show moderator & of course does well.All the young actresses who play the students & staff are first rate..I do not understand the negative reviews for this film. Just because actors we associate with drams or romantic comedy are doing farce is no reason to be negative. In the UK all actors, due all sorts of roles, they are not limited to specific types..Their humour is dryer than ours, they do have the ability to do farces as if they could be serious dramas. In my way of thinking this is much funnier than the silly stuff we usually see. By the way I am ex-New York lad (nearly 82) who is a big fan of cinema from ALL countries. We in the states are just too 'politically correct' most of the time & can no longer appreciate older film styles.This is a very funny film that people just should sit back & enjoy. It is a farce & farces may not make sense at times.It is possible that this version is too 'moderne' for many of todays viewers.I must check the original film & if it has closed captioning I will get & review it. I am reasonably certain my ratings will be about the same.Ratings: ***1/2 (out of 4) 95 points (out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 1o)",St. Trinian's
15,Enchorde,Cute comedy,6,25 August 2009,"Recap: St Trinians is a school for girls, and it is in deep trouble. A few weeks from foreclosure it also under attack from the minister of education. And rightly so, on St Trinians anarchy reigns. But the students figure they would never survive at a normal school so they organize themselves to save the school. All they have to do is rig a national televised competition and break in to the National Museum.Comments: Even if the St Trinians are the self proclaimed defenders of anarchy it is a rather sweet movie, with rather harmless but mostly funny jokes. I don't know if it was intended to be, but it actually was pretty cute.The story rather foolish, and Rupert Everett as the headmistress might not have been the best casting ever made, but a lot of the other young actresses impressed on me. Talulah Riley wasn't hopefully a one hit wonder and Gemma Aterton has already made it as a Bond-girl. I think both might have great careers ahead of them and will in a few years time look back at this as a somewhat silly but funny experience.That was what I felt about, a little silly, but mostly funny.6/10",St. Trinian's
16,Sirus_the_Virus,I found it highly enjoyable.,8,1 February 2010,"I saw one of the original St. Trinians films. I really enjoyed it. Then years after I watched a remake of some sort. Though it was a little different, I still very much enjoyed it. The film is at times very funny, and at times very clever. St. Trinians was a very pleasant surprise. I hope to see more of them.The remakes have some of the similar things to it. Alistir Sim used to play the female school principal. Now Rupert Everett is playing her and he does a very good job as usual. He is the best thing about the film pretty much.Everett plays both Mrs. Fritton and Fritton's brother. when the brother brings his niece to stay at St. Trinians school, she soon realizes what it actually is. A carefree school. The girls that go there are bitches. So when a prime minister(played by Colin Firth) takes a visit, things don't go well.Eventually, do to financial issues, the school is going to shut down. So the girls try to find a way to save it. That way is a heist which involves the girls stealing The girl with a pearl earring painting.The film is very funny. The cast is very good. and I had a lot of fun with this film. Apparently, they are making a second and third film. I can't wait to see them. St. Trinians is a very pleasant surprise. Everett is just great.St. Trinians: 4/5",St. Trinian's
17,Joxerlives,A great revival of a classic British series,8,1 January 2013,"Growing up you always watched the St Trinians films on a Bank Holiday afternoon and they were great fun, especially with Joyce Grenfall and Alister Sim on board. When I heard of a revival I was dubious, 'Wildcats of St Trinians', the last film hadn't been that good and had lost the innocence of the earlier black and white films in a strange way. All told though this was absolutely marvellous, capturing the anarchic spirit of its' illustrious forbearers. So many good things, the hockey game, the disreputable St Trinians staff, Lena Hedly almost unrecognisable from her Terminator role as indeed is soul singer Paloma Faith as the leader of the goths, Stephen Fry, always a delight, Colin Firth brilliantly spoofing his Pride and Prejudice sex bomb image.Obviously this is the ideal film if you have a school uniform fetish. They avoid anything distasteful and succeed in having their cheesecake and eating it with the girls sex appeal by resorting to the original films trick of dividing St Trinians into only 2 forms with nothing in between. The upper sixth are all a bunch of pouting, gorgeous dollybirds in sexy schoolgirl outfits who are 20 if they're a day and the lower fourth are all a bunch of feral little monsters in shapeless gymslips who barely qualify as human never mind female.However the wonderful Rupert Everett absolutely steals the show and no mistake. He's utterly terrific as the Margeret Thatcher/Boudica like Miss Firtton who actually loves her girls and is loved by then in return AND as her dissolute brother Carnaby. The relationship between Miss Fritton and her niece is beautifully played and as a whole you know that the girls all love one another, the older one's taking care of the younger in a very sweet manner. Bad stuff? Russell Brand, need I say more? Mischa Baron's cameo is also terrible and very obviously shoe-horned in to give the film some appeal in the American market. But all told these are minor points and it's wonderful entertainment all round.",St. Trinian's

On its own, its okay, but it doesn't hold up compared to the first two in the series. You still get a headmistress who is really a man (Rupert Everett this time) and a bunch of scheming, unruly but ultimately enterprising girls. Its actually fun at times to watch, as there are sight gags which are pretty good and the storyline moves along. However, I would suggest you watch this first then watch at least the first two St. Trinian's films from the 50's. The differences are notable. If you're under 25 you'll like this more.

19,Stampsfightclub,a shocking and poor excuse for a British film,3,20 August 2008,"Annabelle Fritton (Riley) is sent to one of the worst all girl schools in the country, which is on the verge of being shutdown.Having a lot of respect for British cinema, and being very patriotic, I am almost disgusted by how this film appears.Gone is the genius and controversy of Trainspotting. The political correctness of Brassed off has disappeared, and we are left with a predictable, unrealistic and a sad excuse for a British film in a dreadful unfunny story about an all girl's school.Though I'm not a massive fan, Colin Firth (Pride and Prejudice) and Rupert Everett (A Midsummer Night's dream) should have carried this film, but gave poor performances in what are two very confusing characters with a bizarre history that is never properly explained.And the supporting cast are all just boring, with no humour and predictability written over their faces. I'm not a fan, but Russell Brand was the best thing about this film, which says a lot when sophisticated actors like Firth can't even match Brand.The plot is boring and all over the place with bizarre visuals and pauses. One of the least funny ""comedies"" I have seen, with perhaps only 3 or 4 laugh out loud moments during the whole 97 minutes.Predictable and way too modern, with jokes about current celebrities and TV shows, I mean how will this appeal to people in 20 years? They won't know what is going on. It is a film that has been made for the current media.The acting is poor, and the plot is always predictable. However there were a few surprises in store and is sometimes interesting.The plot could was all over the place. Started off focusing on the girl who was arriving, then she was lost half way through as it went all political. Then there was a brief introduction of modern day stereotypes, and why that wasn't further developed I will never know.Audiences need a true gritty story about a stereotype. And then this awkward last ditch unrealistic chance to save the school, and was just not what I expected at all and if you're looking for a good teenage comedy, try Ferris Bueller's Day Off or Euro Trip, as St Trinian's is poor, predictable and quite frankly, the worst British film I have ever seen.",St. Trinian's
20,ygwerin1,Not a patch on ANY of the originals,2,31 March 2013,"Why oh why did this film company bother to even consider a remake of these classic British comedies? To be worth doing at all it needs to have some kind of originality with a totally new take on the whole story line. Not simply a pale pastiche with a play on the sexual innuendo of 'naughty schoolgirls' or as some kind of homage to the original films or their actors. This film and its sequel are complete and utter dross, any of the original four films are infinitely preferable to this rubbish. Rupert Everett is terrible in the dual role being far too camp and absolutely no Alastair Sim, and as for Russell Brand he is a travesty as Flash Harry and is not fit to stand in George Cole's shadow.",St. Trinian's

The plot is about a girls' school (St. Trinian's) that is about to close, because it's considered one of the worst schools in the country.Its pupils are terrorists, they say! So, in order to not let it close, the girls join all together and make a plan that will improve the school's name.It is very enjoyable and has some really nice jokes. It even spoofs some movies, like IMPOSSIBLE MISSION For a teenage comedy, it's not bad indeed.I rate it 6/10.",St. Trinian's
22,raypdaley182,Some things are better left as memories,1,13 January 2008,"I'll admit I was curious as to how they thought they could get away with setting this in modern day. Times have changed as has the Education system and with School League tables a place like the classic St. Trinians would be shut down in days.Rupert Everett certainly plays a woman better than he plays a man (playing both Miss Camilla Fritton and her Brother). The 1st introduction to all the cliques within the student population instantly destroys any credibility this movie might have had. St. Trinians had very strict divides on where students went, this has them all living in the same room regardless of age.I'm assuming Annabelle is supposed to be a 6th Former? Russell Brand looks OK as Flash Harry but the idea of him asking a schoolgirl out for a meal? Very dodgy ground to be treading on.We're then introduced to the new English teacher Miss Dickinson (Lena Headey, of 300 fame) as well as the rest of the teachers and get to see more of the school and hear more about their financial problems (they can't afford to pay the teachers).As for the younger girls attacking the Cheltenham Team Coach, school kids just wouldn't get away with that today. They'd be arrested for criminal damage. Modern laws are a lot harder than when the original films were made and kids would get a stern talking to or clip around the ear.After the hockey match (a weak attempt to be Old School St. Trinians) the school is declared bankrupt. The cigarette lighter/gun joke wasn't funny and also very predictable before it was ever lit. After this we find Annabelle's dad wants to sell the school setting him up against her and him as a bad guy.Once the need to raise money has been mooted as an idea they decide to steal a painting under the guise of a School Trip. The cheap Colin Firth joke in the gallery totally isn't funny. As soon as School Challenge is mentioned again the very tenuous link to being able to get into the gallery is solved far too easily.A nice cameo by Stephen Fry as the presenter of School Challenge (almost a kind of QI for kids!), but they were obviously going to have cheated (stealing the questions, drugging their opponents, tiring their opponents out with sex) in order to make the finals.Who rather predictably are against Cheltenham (who they played hockey against earlier) so we know who to expect to see there. Obviously when the minister takes the press to see how bad St. Trinians is they pull the old switch-a-roo and nothing but good things are seen as they tour around the school.Annabelle's various different makeovers aren't necessary. She's not an ugly girl, just a little plain. The cheating method (using earpieces to get answers) in the final was what I'd expected them to use from the start. Colin Firth spots the cheat and nobbles it to stop them, this exposes how dim the St. Trinians students really are.The robbery (through the lasers) is stolen from films like Entrapment, Charlies Angels, Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back and Tenacious D's The Pick Of Destiny so it's nothing new really.The line breaking was obviously going to happen but if your going to steal a painting surely the most important person to escape 1st is the person carrying it? Their just insulting our intelligence by this point. Obviously St. Trinians were going to win the quiz so no surprise there.The ending doesn't really make up for a generally bad film with Flash Harry selling a fake painting painted by Camilla to her brother and the school pretending to find the real painting to claim the reward so they got more money than they needed to save the school.Colin Firth's nude yawn is stolen wholesale out of Notting Hill. With a final ending musical cameo by Girls Aloud it ends a really bad film that only kids are going to enjoy.",St. Trinian's
23,gary-444,"Fun, Frothy Entertainment.",6,28 February 2009,"The original St Trinians series was a classic of it's era, well acted, well written and very funny.Whilst probably falling short of the standards of it's inspiration, it is nonetheless amusing, entertaining and modern.And perhaps that is also it's strength, it borrows from the original without copying it, and the modern incarnation provides sufficient distance for it to be considered on its own merits.Rupert Everett is superb as the School Headmistress, although the likeness to television personality Esther Rantzen is unnerving.Russell Brand demonstrates that his comic talents flourish even better under direction and a script than with the free form of stand-up comedy, as the ""spiv"".Stephen Fry is perfect as a quiz show host, and Colin Firth plays the straight man fall guy with some aplomb. All in all a very good cast.The 100 minute running time is just right. the editing and script is quick with plenty of one liners and visual jokes to watch out for.Though not a work of comic genius this will appeal both to schoolchildren unfamiliar with the original, and parents who are and remember the original with fondness.I would certainly happily see a sequel.",St. Trinian's
24,annevejb,"Who Let The Dogs Out?, v1.02",9,22 February 2010,"If one's stomach can stand this story at all then some might find their DVD to be a valuable possession. It is one of those that I could watch time and time again, as if it is one of those stories where the storyteller has tried to learn from such as Clueless.That puts this feature alongside Mean Girls and Confessions Of A Teenage  and Ice Princess and She's The Man and Wild Child, which I read as part of a quality trail started by Clueless.First sight, St Trinian's is rougher than the others. Acclimatise and try not to take it too seriously it actually feels to be one of the calmer ones. For now I rate Wild Child as the toughest, again that is not obvious at first, and place it closer to the level of Heathers than most, a different sort of pinnacle. In comparison, St Trinian's is for pussy cats. Or dogs.I like it that this story has the word Anarchy. From the late 1990's I had been considering Situational Ethics, aka Conscientisation, as the direction to head in after starting to shrug off the chains of Puritan / Victorian beliefs. This shows something of the breadth that pure anarchy can have and while that includes the cute kitten variety that a big baby might consider as sense there are all sorts of other sides too. How the theme song is used in the feature feels nice and fun and okay, but it is in the extras as a stand alone item and there it actually feels pure evil to me.I like it that the feature also has comments about old time conservative values, why I need to dismiss those is there among the dealings between the head and the minister and the bank manager.In a lot of ways I find the story to be a parody of reality, but including some serious stuff.Cite this story for day to day issues, would that just fuel modern day to day war? St Trinian's can read as a school for what some interpret as the walking dead, I consider that it is best to ignore any temptations to interpret this story in that way. To me it is just a normal, everyday, sort of school such as every big baby becomes surrounded by and Annabel has a big baby role in this. To an outcast, the country that they try to live in can generally appear to be evil. Annabel manages to acclimatise, stop being an outcast. Except that she is not true underclass, she has still got a lot of freedom re decisions and actions. This is more like HSM, Ryan growing when Sharpay removed the tethers. So, HSM tends to show legal activities.I need this story to be something not to take seriously, switch off and relax.Do that, I find this to be a story of quality.I noticed Trinian's stuff in the 50's and 60's and found the concept to be perfect, just the actual thing was a let down. For entertainment I needed what the idea implied. Except that I now have the four DVD set of the earliest Trinian's and find that I need to rate them too, if not as highly as this. They are different, in tune with the understandings of their day.",St. Trinian's
25,Ozzy2000,A good remake of a classic comedy,10,5 July 2008,"I find it hilarious that some reviewers found ""Run Fatboy Run"" great British humour but knock this movie. It shows how hung up they really are. This fun remake of the sixties version is most definitely tame compared with today's realities in Private Girls schools and even my nieces found it hilarious.I think the dope smoking references are a bit much but as I said realty is much worse. I think as the media sensationalizes the dangers to school children they are in fact at the same time creating the wrong role models for them to follow but ultimately its the parents who decide how their children will behave. Just thank god it wasn't an Australian comedy as you would have been snoring right through it.",St. Trinian's
26,jhsteel,Good fun,7,26 May 2008,"This film was entertaining and has something for everyone, especially if you are young at heart. There were quite a few in-jokes about certain members of the cast - one of the schools which competed against St Trinian's in the School Challenge quiz was Rupert Everett's old school (Ampleforth) and the ""Another Country"" comment was brilliant. There were also references to Mr Darcy and of course Colin Firth had another go at the wet-shirt scene. I was impressed by the schoolgirls, who did a good job of convincing me that they were unruly but not clueless and could organise themselves if they wanted to. I am a huge fan of Rupert Everett and he excelled in drag (always knew he would) and his interactions with Colin Firth were as much fun as in their 2 previous outings together (Another Country and Importance of Being Earnest). I was also thrilled to be watching another Ealing Comedy, since I live a stone's throw from the famous studios.",St. Trinian's
27,jafar-iqbal,"So awful, it's actually quite fun",5,21 November 2013,"Annabelle Fritton joins St Trinian's, a school for 'young ladies' that prides itself on the anarchic doctrine of free expression. Fritton struggles to fit in at first, but manages to win them over as all the girls band together to try and save the school from bankruptcy.Okay, so 'St Trinian's' is a pretty awful film, nobody is going to argue that. It's unashamedly predictable, full of stereotypical characters and clichéd scenes and sequences. At every turn, the film gets more and more absurd, and I found myself shaking my head continuously.But here's the thing: as awful as it is, there's something about the film which stopped me from hating it. Because, to be fair, it was made to be awful. 'St Trinian's' is a good old-fashioned British pantomime on the big screen. You have the man in drag, you have the overly-stereotyped characters, you have the completely ridiculous story where nothing makes sense. Perhaps the only thing missing were songs but, other than that, this may as well have been a panto.More than that, though, what endears me about the movie is just how much British talent is on offer. It's like a who's who of young British actors – Talulah Riley, Tamsin Egerton, Lily Cole, Juno Temple and Gemma Arteton to name just a few – all given their time to shine and doing a good job. Egerton, in particular, is excellent as the stupid blonde, getting by with her sex appeal and sheer good luck. It's also nice to see actors like Colin Firth, Stephen Fry and Rupert Everett especially make fun of themselves.Like I say, this is a really awful film, but it's a movie so rubbish that it's actually quite good. I'll never voluntarily choose to watch 'St Trinian's'; but get me drunk enough the night before, and this is a more than adequate Sunday hangover movie.",St. Trinian's

It's so funny and I think that there were a lot of very good actors in this, especially Gemma Arterton. It had a great story-line and it seemed to flow nicely. I think that the 12 age rating was suitable but I think the 15 Ireland rating was a bit harsh as there are a few sex references and the girls do dress very tarty, but it's all for the comedic effect. As soon as this came out on DVD it was on my shelf. This is one of my favorite films ever and anyone will like it, even my parents did! Overall I would say that St. Trinians is a funny film, ideal for girlie sleepovers. I would rate it 9/10 and say that it is suitable for anyone 10-11+.",St. Trinian's
29,graestella,Mostly Excellent,8,30 December 2007,"I was pleasantly surprised by this one. I usually stay away from British comedy films as they are always awful. The young unknowns in the cast were superb and will surely be seen again. Rupert Everett and Colin Firth were both great. Why was the brilliant Lena Heady given about three scenes ? Was she only on set for a week ? Back from the states where she was filming the Terminator series perhaps ? The plot was bearable and the jokes just about funny. ( However I recall really funny movies like Crocodile Dundee - where the laughter in the cinema was deafening. This raised hardly a titter ) My only problem was the amount of drug abuse in it. How on earth did it get a 12a ? At least five characters were spiked. How do you explain this to your child sitting with you in the cinema ? I found this doubly disappointing as it soured the otherwise health promoting message of the film. i.e. girls being independent and different, by having them take drugs which are anything but. There were no rappers, pimps or gun toting gangsters in the film, so why include their negative drug taking ?",St. Trinian's
30,Redcitykev,A Successful updating of a British Instituation,7,17 January 2008,"Being a great fan of the original series of St Trinian's films I admit I approached this new version with some dread. My greatest fear was that the makers had gone for a slapstick comedy, full of swear words and crudity. I need not have worried, as what we have here is a successful updating of a series of films, and cartoons least we forget the roots of the originals - that is full of fun, great in jokes, and a surprisingly good narrative.Needless to say the basic plot is the same as always, ie the girls have to save the school from closure, and the way this is achieved is, within the limits set by the world the film inhabits, quite believable.The humour in the film is at time, of course, risqué, but never crude, and I did not detect one swear word, quite a change for this day and age. The performances are universally good, without ever being excellent. Rupert Everett in his duel role may not be an Alister Sim, but he does OK, and Colin Firth as the Education Minister does have some very funny scenes, especially when the dog - Mr Darcy - is...?! See the film and you will see what I mean (of course there is a very nice in joke here, but I think many of the audience I watched the film with missed it!) Of the girls Jodie Whittaker as Beverly handles her role as a Plain Jane becoming a sexy Jaaannneee!!! very well. If there is a weak link in the casting then it must be Russell Brand as Flash Harry. Try as he might he just does not have the charm, or slim, of George Cole, and I am sure there must have been a better Flash out there somewhere! An honorary mention must be made of Stephen Fry as the host of a game show that is an obvious take on University Challenge - on which, of course, Fry appeared many years ago as a contestant (this intercontexuality just goes on and on!). Playing up to his image he has cultivated on QI, the scene in which he is stoned is quite superb! Although it may not go down as most people's favourite film of the year, and it might be a tad too British for foreign markets, especially USA!, this film is nonetheless a very entertaining diversion for 1 hour 40 minutes. Also it has a very good, and clever, soundtrack, with all versions of songs heard being by Female artists - even Girls Are Loud sound good! Finally, for those not in the know one of the girls who help to give Beverly a makeover is Zoe Salmon from Blue Peter, and she is very sexy!",St. Trinian's
31,michaellaing71,Thumbs up for St Trinians,7,22 December 2007,"St Trinian's was never going to be a classic of British cinema and I am glad that it doesn't really try. The worst I can say about the film, is that it is constantly entertaining, which I find is a rarity now days. It could and should have been a complete disaster, fortunately it is harmless silly fun. The plot is dumb and the humour is never laugh out loud funny but I always had a smile on my face and I left the cinema more cheerful than when I went in, which is always a good sign.I was quite happy with the acting in the film. Russell Brand is not the greatest actor in the world and a few of the girls are a bit grating but most of the main characters are OK, with good performances from Gemma Arterton and Talulah Riley. Colin Firth plays it gloriously straight though out and has some wonderful moments, whilst Rupert Everett is a constant joy to watch as Miss Fritton/Carnaby Fritton.I won't go on about the behind camera stuff because that would be a bit pointless, apart from to say that it does the job. The editing had its moments and I did enjoy the little animated scene half way though. Although not really my taste in music generally, I thought the soundtrack was very good and suited the mood of the film well, although I would have like to have heard the St Trinian's original theme at the beginning of the film, if even for a few moments.I was over all very happy with the film and am glad I went to see it, it ticked most of the boxes which I wanted and rarely let itself down.",St. Trinian's

I personally cannot understand why there are so many positive reviews for this utter nonsense I can only assume the makers paid people to write reviews.This is no Monty Python by any stretch of the imagination and compared to just about any contemporary US film of the same ilk there is just no comparison. American comedy film makers such as the farrely Brothers would simply blow this out of the water on their worst day.This movie can only appeal to 12 year old girls. Its of the same style as that awful Spice Girls embarrassment and that equally awful Nuns On The run which was an abomination of comedy movies.The film is littered with Girl Power and political correctness from start to finish. Nearly all the male characters are designed to be hated which is a common portrayal of males in British media today. I found it very difficult not to turn off after 20 minutes but since I hired the video I wanted my moneys worth I suppose. However, I feel cheated at helping pay for this movies production.Im sorry but it has not one single redeeming quality. Lowest form of humour you can get, utterly not funny and a movie made by people who obviously think they are cool but have no business being in the movie game.Rubbish and an embarrassment to British film.

Latter's educational ethos is free expression -- black marketeering, bullying, gambling and weapons practice -- and no sooner is Annabelle in the school than she's being videotaped in the shower by the other girls and appearing on YouTube.In place of the original two tiers of pupils -- fourth-formers (scraggy little monsters) and sixth-formers (sirens in gym slips and garter belts) -- the script delivers a cross-section of Brit-youth demographics: chavs, posh totties, geeks, emos (aka goths) and first-years, all ruled over by head girl Kelly (Gemma Arterton). The girls' black-market fixer, Flash Harry, memorably played by Cole in the originals as a Cockney crook, comes over much more weakly in TV comic Brand's fey perf.With the school in its usual dire financial straits, the girls decide to steal Vermeer's painting ""Girl With a Pearl Earring"" from London's National Gallery, where the final of a student quiz show will take place. But first the team of terminally dumb posh totties -- Chelsea (Tamsin Egerton), Peaches (Amara Khan) and Chloe (Antonia Bernath) -- have to cheat their way through to the final.Last half-hour finally builds a head of steam as the girls' commando team, led by Kelly, heists the painting while the posh totties blunder their way through the final under the unctuous gaze of its quizmaster (Fry). In the audience is hardline education minister Geoffrey Thwaites (Firth), a conflicted onetime lover of Miss Fritton's who's been trying to shutter St. Trinian's.Lacking any really sharp dialogue, the film just about goes the distance by juggling its characters in short, sketch-like scenes and inserting occasional musical montages. But beyond Everett's labored drag act (he's made up to look like veteran Brit TV presenter Esther Rantzen) and Firth's unsmiling pol (mainly the butt of in-jokes about the actor's career), none of the other characters get much of a chance to register.Experienced performers like Celia Imrie, Anna Chancellor and Lena Headey get little screen time as teaching staff. Among the pupils, Arterton comes across strongest, but it's actually little blonde twins Cloe and Holly Mackie who manage to catch the real Searle spirit as a pair of pesky first-years.Sole standout on the tech side is costume designer Rebecca Hale's work, which cleverly integrates the traditional Searle look of the girls' duds with modern yoof fashion.

(Both Rupert Everett (yes, yes, we know he's gay, and who in the 21st C gives a damn?) and Colin Firth (who probably isn't, but camps it up with gusto) are an embarrassment to themselves and the so-called British cinema industry.This is a film that has attracted state funding from the National Lottery and the UK's Film Council. The audience that I saw it with were all BAFTA members, and even more embarrassingly, they applauded at the end. Why did they applaud? Perhaps it was because the British Academy membership was so pleased that it was a British picture they felt obliged to leave their brains outside and let jingoism rule their hearts. Of course it says nothing positive about British cinema or for that matter BAFTA members! This is a puerile load of old recycled garbage. Do not be tempted to see it.",St. Trinian's
44,killoa2002,"This is what you call ""modernisation""",8,31 December 2007,"Okay, so first I want you to take into account what other critics say about this film. Then, forget it.This film is witty, charming, and hilarious and outrageous. Critics say it does not suit the originals, however if you look close, you will see everything from the original packed up in there. This film has been modernized to suit today's audience. That is what you must understand about this film. Rupert Everett is perfect in the role(s) of the Fritton twins. Colin Firth makes a very believable minister of Education. Russel Brand portrays Flash Harry with all the wit. The film retains the famous thigh high skirts and suspender stockings, with devious pyromaniac little girls, and the unruly school girls. Definitely worth the money.",St. Trinian's
45,angie-235,Colin and Rupert are a perfect combination.,8,14 April 2008,"I think fans of the two leading men would enjoy added benefits . They should get the references to their past films . I think the one to ""Another Country"" made me laugh the most but I can't say why. The crazy goings on were not that special it was the small touches like the wonderful Camilla Fritton and Colin's dead straight acting. I enjoyed the inclusion of ""Ampleforth"" in the quiz show knowing it was Rupert's old school. Russell Brand surprised me by his performance as I am no fan but he was very good. The girls were a bit difficult to judge . I liked the little ones but the older ones were annoying. It's certainly not shocking though ,certainly not more so than the originals. If you buy the D.V.D then like me you might find many of the deleted scenes better than many in the film. If you enjoy it but haven't seen any of the films referred to do yourself a favour and see what a brilliant actor Rupert is in straight films .",St. Trinian's
46,gunstar_hero,St. Trinian's Doesn't Make the Grade,4,21 May 2008,"The perennial problem facing cinematic depictions of schools is that they can never be made to appear wholly realistic. While there is an outside chance that you had the pleasure of attending Sweet Valley High, it is far more likely that your scholastic memories are a chiaroscuro of brief successes and heart-breaking failures, of best-friends and bitchiness, of humbling obedience and flagrant rebellion. Adolescents can be the most amoral, violent, foul-mouthed and sexually deviant creatures of all.This latest incarnation of St. Trinian's enjoys a comparatively angelic student body: ""a Hogwarts for pikeys"" quips new-girl Talulah Riley; nor do the teachers have it so bad, save for the odd shower of paintballs. Some of the gags have been updated, with a peculiar emphasis on surveillance: web cameras, hidden shower cameras, dog-collar cameras and cameras disguised as hockey sticks all combine to keep the crafty girls updated. This aside, the screenplay can offer little else more ingenious than a bog-standard ""Dennis the Menace"" episode. It could only be expected that Ronald Searle's famous cartoons would have aged significantly by now, relying as they did upon the audience's familiarity with a conservative educational ethos dominated by ritual, tradition and dictatorial tutors. Even today's privately educated children will only recognise this environment from the films that attempt to satirize it. Yet this provides no excuse for excising the spirit of Searle's gleeful black humour. The 2007 imagining is tame, insipid and bland, dragged along by a clutch of forgettable characters who appear, ironically, to have been parachuted in from a dime-a-dozen American high school comedy.Contributing in no small measure to the film's difficulties is the absence of the school itself from the proceedings. No sooner have we undergone the obligatory meet-the-cliques initiation scene (which has not been improved upon since ""Clueless"") than St. Trinian's is facing both financial ruin and the reformism of Colin Firth's preening education minister. A mixed bag of cameos from Stephen Fry, Russell Brand and an execrable Mischa Barton can do little to save the horrendously formulaic David and Goliath storyline that follows. A movie that ought to be intimately about a school goes out of its way to escape it.Far from being subversive, risqué or consistently funny, ""St. Trinian's"" is best received as broadly conventional children's tosh, half Dahl and half Anglicized Disney. There are bright points: Talulah Riley shines throughout and is probably destined for bigger roles, while Brand's one-liners elicit the odd smile. Rupert Everett, too, cross-dressing as headmistress Camilla Fritton, seems to enjoy every moment  it's only a shame the audience aren't in on the joke.",St. Trinian's
47,ic2,Good in parts,5,31 December 2007,"Mixed views like the mixed reviews really.Firstly this is a film for the tweenies (12-15 I would have thought) though on the night we went despite the 12a certificate there were 5 and 6 year olds there. Most of the humour was for kids, though there were enough references to amuse adults and lots of references to other films.Everett was superb as a the headmistress, and remembering that this was slapstick, absolutely fine. Not so convinced by Colin Firth, but he was OK. Russell Brandt seemed nervous. Otherwise everone else played their roll perfectly. The young actors were splendid.As stated, a good film for young teenagers who can identify with the schoolgirl antics, and in our cinema they were laughing from the beginning.Not a patch on the originals? Well different. The originals were 40 to 50 years ago and they were made in a different age. I like them, but do they appeal to 12 and 15 year olds today? This is the problem with remakes, we always compare them with the ""classic"" and find them wanting.",St. Trinian's
48,marxthedude,St. Trinians. The school to be avoided in the film to be avoided!!!,1,24 December 2007,"""Chaved up"" for the millennium comes a timely if unwanted remake of the 'St. Trinian' films of the sixties. St. Trinians is the worst school in the country known for bad grades and unruly behaviour and an equally eccentric and unruly headmistress, Miss. Fritton, it's targeted for severe investigation by Education new broom Geoffrey Thwaites. With the bank looming round the door, things pad out even worse for the school. Even Fritton's caddish brother plans to twist the knife to make money from the school's misfortune, even with his daughter's recent enrolment. This as such serves the plot for the unruly behaviour to ring out, cue a bizarre heist, a ""University Challenge"" style quiz and general anarchy in the name of saving the school. But it's here 'Trinians' is woefully misguided. What was considered anarchy and amusingly unusual behaviour in the time of the original films, simply is the teenage norm now. Drug-peddling, booze loving, flirtatious schoolgirls are more a problem these days then a source for comedy so the underlying tone becomes somewhat sinister. The film tries to have it's cake and eat it. Drinking is only implied by kids, never actually seen and only older characters are seen dispensing 'uppers' and 'downers' to unwitting participants for 'amusing results'. 'Poshy totty' flirt and dress provocatively but never actually are seen in an embrace. It's this kind of humour which proves even worse baring in mind it's target audience. It takes the film to a seedy and unpleasant level, pitching knowing drug-jokes at kids, many of which ask us to laugh at people 'buzzing' many of whom have had drinks spiked. Definitely the films lowest low. Family friendly? I don't think so.... How this film ended up with a '12a' certificate in the UK is beyond me! Add to this unwanted sexual jokes and you have a film far too adult for kids but too childish for adults. Of course, with some nifty direction and timing, 'Trinians' could maybe make this fly, but the film has neither. The characterisation poor, the plot threadbare, painfully predictable and struggling to add up. The resolvent of the key heist rendered pointless when the exact object of theft isn't even needed. Even when 'Trinians' is aiming for smart it fails. Numerous 'Girl With A Pearl Earring' jokes are no doubt lost on it's key audience, probably thankfully as they are of 'christmas cracker' standard at best. Colin Firth is top of his game in a film you'd assume he'd be out of place in, TV personality, Russell Brand, you'd believe has been thrust into the proceedings to score some street cred, but thankfully is more than acceptable but the usually excellent Rupert Everett is hamming it up just a notch too much here. Kudos go to it's teenage cast (one has to weep at the already pretty Talulah Riley, given a 'slutted-up' makeover in one scene). Overall the acting is decent, making even the worst of lines bearable. The film tries to whip up a frenzy of enthusiasm and fun, but as UK girl group Girls Aloud stomp on in the finale shouting a song about 'discount rates for Chavs and their mates' you pretty much feel the whole thing is just tawdry and cheap. Much like it's level of humour and even more upset tingly, it's level of decency.",St. Trinian's
49,XTRADER,A Right British Waste of Money,1,15 July 2008,"Oh dear oh dear - I didn't rush to see this - I waited to see it on the small screen and I must say what a waste of time that was. I'm embarrassed to be British sometimes because of the tripe the British Film industry churns out. How can the UK be taken seriously when it produces garbage like this? Yes its pleasing to see Girls in School Uniform but really this doesn't merit a remake of a dire series that was finished years ago! This film is consistently bad throughout; badly edited would be an understatement! Did the magical duo directors really know what they were doing? ""Oliver Parker"" & ""Barnaby Thompson"" should really never work again! If these two geniuses ever do read this - can you answer my question why such a primitive badly put together film really required 2 directors? Fragmented, predictable, badly acted, badly acted, very badly directed, and appalling soundtrack that made you want to stab someone - oh dear oh dear oh dear!

50,joisepeterson,"Enjoyed this film, word of warning.",8,8 May 2009,"Based on the creation by Ronald Searle and the movie The Belles of St Trinian's (1954). This current verison of the naughtiest school in Britain has a more current flavor. I personally have only seen snippets of the other St Trinian's films the last being in 1980.The story takes place with headmistress Camilla Fritton who has been headmistress of St Trinian's for the past fifteen years, most likely taking over from her aunt. The school has run out of funds and the bank is on the burst of foreclosing the school. Along the way Fritton's niece Annabelle arrives from Cheltam Ladies College. She seems to be out of place in a school which has wild ten year olds and teen girls who are in their own clicks.This film is a blast to watch for most ages. My eight year old cousin watched this with me and enjoyed the hockey game and the scene were the chav, geek and head girl do their mission.Words of warning. There is many current culture references and this includes drugs and sex.In one scene, the first year girls are making vodka, the emos make esctasy pills. Miss Fritton in one scene is smoking a joint.One of the clicks is seen in their lingere and one is talking on a phone sex chatline. Even saying that she likes it ""Greek"" style. While another student is seen running her finger and thumb over her lips suggesting oral sex.My cousin was oblivious to the above.I really enjoyed this movie and St Trinian's is the first movie to come up with the naughty school girl fantasy.",St. Trinian's

I don't believe that original films or books are always the best but in this case the 1954 'Belles of St Trinians' with Alistair Sims has much more wacky joie de vivre & is still the better of these two fluffily light, silly films. This version really should have been the better of the two, alas.",St. Trinian's

It's so funny and I think that there were a lot of very good actors in this, especially Gemma Arterton. It had a great story-line and it seemed to flow nicely. I think that the 12 age rating was suitable but I think the 15 Ireland rating was a bit harsh as there are a few sex references and the girls do dress very tarty, but it's all for the comedic effect. As soon as this came out on DVD it was on my shelf. This is one of my favorite films ever and anyone will like it, even my parents did! Overall I would say that St. Trinians is a funny film, ideal for girlie sleepovers. I would rate it 9/10 and say that it is suitable for anyone 10-11+.",St. Trinian's

It doesn't. This is why I think it works. Like the sequels from the first film, once again St Trinian's moves the concept into its own era. It's jam packed with innuendo and humour and a new plot line. Perhaps it'll never be as good as 'The Belles' but then, none of the other sequels were as good as 'The Belles' either, and they didn't try to be.

This film is best described as a bitter attack on British cinema, maybe even cinema in general it is that bad. The acting is some of the worst I've ever seen at times it is so bad it makes Keanu Reeves seem like Peter'O'Toole, the story and writing are so sloppy it makes Garfield 2 seem like Lord Of The Rings and the humor... I haven't even got a comparison for that every time the film tries TRIES to make a joke or be funny it's like someone is rubbing cheese graters up and down your ears. The way the lines are delivered is so robotic almost to the point of them not sounding human. I have nothing good to say about this movie apart from I can assure you that it will end (asuming you haven't already gone all Tommy DeVito on the disc or hung yourself in sheer agony) and what makes it worse they made a sequel. To sum up don't buy this film, don't rent this film don't even look at this film it is an abomination to the film industry and is one of they many reasons I don't believe in God because if God existed this wouldn't have been given the green light.

I also liked the strong references to Pride and Prejudice and Girl with a Pearl Earring, as Colin Firth was in this and and those other two. My favourite scene in the film was the hockey scene with the girls taking on a rival school team who like to play rough. The only thing wrong is Russell Brand.

59,olihine,Please leave brain at door,1,3 January 2008,"There isn't much I can add about this film that hasn't already been said. To begin with, I'm really confused about who its target audience is supposed to be. If its aimed at children, then why the light-hearted and frankly nasty take on themes such as bullying and drugs? If adults, then why the utterly contrived plot line and brainless, dated jokes which nowadays just jar with audiences? This film fails on both counts. It is tasteless and trashy tripe, too loud and vulgar and concerned with itself to realise it is being tasteless and trashy. The reckless behaviour depicted at the school is no longer seen as anarchic, in our day and age it is the norm, and horribly depressing and shameful this should be too. This being the case, you would have thought the makers of this film may have treated the subject with sensitivity rather than celebrate such childhood boorishness and thuggery with idle jokes and caricatures.What really sums up this film for me is when the already perfectly-nice-looking new girl is force-manicured by her new friends and turned into a thirteen year old slut. Horaay! I'm sorry, but I fail to see why lottery money should be given to such crass, bone-headed, lowest-common-denominator trash. I certainly fail to see how the film could have attracted such skilled stars, all of whom have sunk lower in my estimation as a result.This film furthers the cause of British cinema not a jot.

To me, St Trinians is made for teenagers and that is meant to be a laugh at Christmas, not a dramatised movie.I thought the movie was is very successful, especially characters head girl Kelly and Flash harry- they're awesome; Most of my friends have watched it and they love it. Reviews that are being made, are all about how it isn't as believable or funny as the previous films but if they can't laugh at the little moments such as when Flash Harry and the twins are having a discussion about the alcohol they're producing, then they clearly haven't got a sense of humour.Overall, To me, the film was great and suitable for teenagers, not adults; I left the cinema in stitches and that if you HAVE got a sense of humour, it is a must see movie!",St. Trinian's

I knew it could never match the original but I was determinant to treat it as a completely new piece and I succeeded. Where us the original is a classic this just does not know what it wants to be. It tries so desperately hard to be ""Modern"" and that is one of its major drawbacks. It has no idea what its target audience is. Many of the jokes are very adult yet the whole thing has the feel of a American Saturday morning cartoon, See Inspector Gadget. The soundtrack is terrible and has already dated the film. The casting is very poor and lacks imagination. Good actors are left to flounder and the whole film is festooned with sub-standard stereo types that look like they came from a forgettable assortment of music videos. Its a shame as Britain has the talent to have made a great version of this. The director and studio were not part of that talent however and a great deal of money was wasted as was my time, even though I switched of after 45 minutes. That was more than enough.

You cant really call any of the acting, they all tried their best with what turned out to be a pretty unfunny script overall, certainly not a patch on the original movies. If you watch the film carefully, you can even actually tell where bits of the film were cut out, because one certain part makes absolutely no sense whatsoever until you have actually seen the cut parts (available on youtube incidentally if anyone wants to view them). Rupert Everett deserves a mention for his portrayal of the headmistress, an excellent job. Colin Firth tries his best with the role he is given, but, special mention to Gemma Arterton, who manages to put both of those into the shade with a superb performance in her role of head girl and even Russell Brand manages a creditable Flash Harry.

My interest levels had only picked up a fraction by the time the film mercifully reached its end. There is virtually no character development and almost no plot. Fair enough this is not intended to be a particularly complicated or serious movie, but it should at least do something! I really don't understand what this movie is trying to achieve and who it is intended to appeal to. It is neither clever nor funny nor involving in any way. For an intended comedy there are virtually no jokes. Literally the only time I almost chuckled was when reference was made to someone ""shagging Colin Firth"", which actor of course otherwise features in the film. Without condescending I suppose the outrageous unlikely antics of the girls of St. T's might draw a few laughs from pre-teen audiences, but the many references to sex and drugs suggest this film obviously isn't intended for the only people who might possibly appreciate it.Trying very hard to find something nice to say, most of the cast give a decent enough effort with absolutely nothing to work with, and the music is pretty sharp. Your time is much better spent doing something else with the soundtrack in the background than watching the film itself.

I think there is something missing in this that is present in the earlier films,of which I think I like the Train Robbery the most. I keep getting the feeling with the earlier ones, to various degrees, that they were made by people who were quite happy to make a living out of them but that they disapproved of 'the world of St Trinians'. But in this one, it seems to be made by people who love the idea of St T. I wish I had gone to it rather than the Colin Firth-approved school that I went to. Bit of a problem in the showers.

71,winkler-torsten,I really wanted to like this movie...,2,15 April 2008,"...but honestly, I ended up hugely disappointed. I watched this a couple of days ago and took it as a reason to write my first comment on IMDb.What happened to British humor?? In the last couple of years, I used to have great fun watching movies like Hot Fuzz. When I heard about this movie, I thought, with a well-known cast and a promising story nothing could go wrong. In fact, almost everything did. I did not laugh once during the entire movie.This movie suffers from what I like to call the ""not-a-single-likable-character-syndrome"". I really could not care less about any of the pupils or teachers. The only one I mildly rooted for was the Minister of Education (Colin Firth), although it was clear from the start that he would be the one to be poked fun at.The schoolgirls were all portrayed as shallow, selfish, spoiled, superficial sluts who, while they are not doing drugs, building bombs or having sex, mostly run around parading their stupidity. I wondered how they were able to operate all the high-tech gadgets with so little intelligence. Did they ever actually learn anything at school? I don't think so... The only exception is Annabelle, the ""new girl"". However, the other pupils do their best to turn her into one of their own... The teachers are virtually non-existent. All this could not even pass as a satire on modern school life.As far as the story is concerned, I was prepared to get a predictable plot with some unbelievable / unrealistic twists. What I got instead was in fact hard to swallow. This seems to be aimed at pre-teen children, all the ""problems"" are solved in a blink of an eye, and the girls get away with ANYTHING they do, and believe me, they do a lot of silly stuff. This could have been done so much better had it been just a little more down-to-earth.To sum this up, this movie will not work for adults as the storyline and all the characters are far too childish. It will not work for little children either, as there are far too many references to the adult world, drug abuse, crime, you name it... It wasn't moving, interesting, exciting or even mildly entertaining. Two thumbs down. If I had a third thumb, I would point that one down, too.",St. Trinian's
72,mklimm,Continuously terrible,2,10 July 2008,"I am not quite sure what other people like in this movie (Rating of 5.7??) but this movie is consistently terrible. Normally a movie does not flunk in EVERY category but this one definitely does.In Short Form: Acting: Bad; Cinematography: Weak; Lighting: terrible; Writing and Screenplay: awful; music: poorIn Long Form: This movie is the worst one I saw during the last years. The plot is as shallow as it is dumb and funny scenes are rather rare. Actually I laughed harder and more often in Terminator. Every scene seems unprofessional and more like a school project than a seriously produced movie. It is a shame for everyone participating therein.Additional: I think the idea behind the whole movie is to make a movie for kids and add some (sexual) references that can only be identified by adults so it's not too boring for them to watch (like seen in Shrek, Antz, ...). But here there's no hope here because the overall quality of the film is just too low to be appealing for adults and with age restriction from min 11-15 the only target group I could imagine is basically excluded (Girls from 10 - 13).Conclusion: For waste bin",St. Trinian's
73,miss-bloom,brilliant,9,30 December 2007,I loved it and i'd gladly go and see it again. It was hilarious but it still managed to be witty and credible. But obviously it might not be to everyone's taste. My favourite characters are flash harry and the head girl(Kelly?)they bounce off each other really well but are also brilliant as separate characters. Russell brand plays flash brilliantly as a cheeky chap type character who is more fun than bad. Chelsea and the blonde girls are so stupid (i won't say blonde because i'm blonde my self) The rest of the characters just seem to contrast really well and Anabelle (the new girl) is a brilliantly sweet and innocent character.,St. Trinian's
74,Oc_lvr,Disappointing,2,29 December 2007,"I have to say that I was quite looking forward to seeing this film but I was really disappointed when I finally did go and see it. The plot line was predictable and too stupid for my liking. The whole cameras-everywhere and little-gadgets that all the girls seem to have was just silly. I would've expected better of British Cinema...Yeah, there were a few laughs but not enough. I didn't care for Rupert Everett's character(s) and none of the girls were outstanding actors either. The only good bit was the end...Girls Aloud were great. They're the only reason I gave it 2. Why was Mischa Barton in it? She was probably the only American...why even cast her in a British film? The part she has was tiny too. It was a waste of money.",St. Trinian's
75,goss-james,Only wins one prize in my opinion...,1,1 January 2008,"This film pips The Stepford Wives into The Worst Movie That I Have Ever Seen. Now, I can live with unfunny, but parts of this film were genuinely DISTURBING. And by parts of it, I mean lots of it. With the older St. Trinians films, they were shocking as they included taboos for the older generation, such as bringing boys into their dorm room. This movie had to be more modern shocking, so the filmmakers tried not to disappoint, with small children making drugs references, and teenagers flaunting themselves. Don't get me wrong, there were one or two clever film jokes (Colin Firth's turn as Mr. Darcy being exploited again, and an Italian Job reference), but these were lost in very crude jokes. These weren't even slapstick, and tried to go down the road of 'Meet the Parents' style embarrassment, to poor effect. Small children will be bewildered and scared, while the teenagers will be cringing (for all the wrong reasons). I hope this does not start a career nosedive for Firth (whose off day was not helped by a poor script) and Stephen Fry (who managed to hold his own in the familiar quiz-master role). But any film that manages to expose Russell Brand as a poser with no discernible talent deserves the one star, I suppose...",St. Trinian's
76,mike_in_uk,One of the worst films that I have seen,1,28 December 2007,"WARNING: Contains SPOILERS The summary says it all - I am having trouble thinking of a worse film that I have seen in my life. I am not a Guardian reader or PC culture snob, but this lacks any originality, wit or purpose. There is nothing wrong with updating classic films, but this feels more like a love-in among the writers, directors and cast without any thought for what the audience may enjoy.So what was wrong with this film? First, the script was appalling. There was little originality, and the jokes were simply tired and unfunny. Characters were nothing more than caricatures, particularly the girls from the rival school (richer, upper class bullying snobs) and Colin Firth's Tory minister (hardliner who wants everyone to conform, thwarted by the noble underdogs of St Trinians). There was no sense of why the school may be worth saving, or why we should care.Secondly, following on from the script, the plot was asinine. I know the plot is not the point in such films, but the story was disjointed - more like a series of episodes designed to move things along than a coherent whole. A heist to save the school from bankruptcy could have been really funny - if the script had established why the school was worthwhile (other than they have fun and free expression is allowed), if we had seen more of the planning and inevitable mis-steps associated with such a plan, and if the characters had been more likable (indeed, had they been characters at all).Thirdly, the acting. Colin Firth looked like he didn't want to be there, Rupert Everett looked so pleased with himself for how clever he was for playing both roles and so forgot to act, while excellent supporting cast such as Toby Jones and Anna Chancellor just looked embarrassed. The schoolgirls couldn't really be faulted - it was not their fault that the script was terrible and the directors had no idea of what they were doing.What was good about the film? The Girls Aloud performance at the end was fun, by far and away the best thing about the film.Overall, this was a complete and utter waste of time.",St. Trinian's
77,comedy_viewer,Sublime,8,1 January 2008,"Quite simply the best film I have watched since I saw the originals, this film is supremely funny in its own right. The references in art and the character of Everett to Alaistar Simm were perfectly apt, and the school cliques were the perfect way to advance the school through time. There was never anything entirely realistic about St. Trinians, and this film does not aim for realism, simply for entertainment, a commodity which is often severely lacking in modern cinema. The child acting was not wooden, unlike that of the Golden Compass which I saw on the previous night, and the rest of the cast were their wonderful best. Well done!",St. Trinian's
78,elaviel-1,"Excellent film, I'm going twice!",8,23 December 2007,"Very good adaptation, went with my family and all ages were laughing.Rupert Evveret plays 2 very different characters and succeeds well in both. Colin Firth is a lovely as ever fitting into a role that suits him very well and a certain scene from a Jane Austin adaptation is resurrected.The newcomers who make up the majority of the school children are superb, not only do they achieve in acting well beyond their years. They provided as much entertainment as the other more experienced cast members.The most surprising cast member of them all was Russell Brand. I went into the film with a despise of the man and thinking he would ruin the film for me, but he was actually pretty good. In all I found St Trinian's to be a good film and definitely one for teenage girls to watch, but don't worry if you get dragged along to I guarantee you'll leave laughing.Don't forget to listen the song in the credits!!!",St. Trinian's
79,nicocojones,A film to avoid,1,16 December 2007,"This film is without a single redeeming feature. Two fine actors - Everett and Firth - are terrible. Rupert Everett has all the wit of an amateur ugly sister and Colin Firth looks car sick....Russell Brand - a comic of considerable presence is reduced to a tiny shadow of the person he is in real life.Every joke is telegraphed,the script is lame and charmless and the direction utterly predictable.The rest of the cast don't really act but scream and shout their way through some truly awful lines.It would be unfair to say there was characterisation as there is no figure who is anything other than paper thin and two dimensional.There is more drama and interest in a game of patience than there is in this truly shoddy piece of work.....",St. Trinian's
80,fab-46,Wickedly brilliant Brit flick!,10,16 December 2007,"I have just returned from a preview screening of Ealing Studio's new film- a continuation of the St. Trinian's franchise which last had an outing in the 1960s, and I have to say it is the most fun i've had in a cinema for AGES!Re-inventing the twee originals St. Trinian's has been brought into the modern day with a bang! With Goths, Emos, Posh Tottie, Chavs and Geeks galore they don't miss anything out! Right from the start as one of the main girls is driven upto the school for the first time past a car in flames you know you're going to be in for a riot! The production design was brilliant- there was so much to look at and laugh at- it must have taken days to dress each set! Rupert Everett and Colin Firth make a brilliant team- they bounce off each other and give the film a great heart- Rupert in drag is a sight to see- I wonder if Camilla PB has seen it yet- because he's got her down brilliantly! Russell Brand really shows that he can act and deliver other people's funny lines- you really look forward to him cropping up throughout the film.The girls are brilliant- they all hit their laughs and are never too over the top. Gemma Atherton is superb as is Paloma (?) who plays one of the Emos. All in all- I laughed from start to finish- it's a great film for the family this Christmas that is 10x funnier than the disappointing Enchanted that really wasn't the family film of the decade as Disney would like us to believe. Go and see it- if u've got kids they'll definitely thank you for it- or if not just go and see it to escape the Christmas shopping, families and wrapping paper this weekend! You won't be disappointed!Best British film since the Full Monty!",St. Trinian's
81,ssundial,"Lacklustre, unfunny and hugely disappointing",3,6 January 2008,"As a past lover of the St Trinians genre, both myself and my two youngsters found this new version a total yawn, without one decent laugh from start to finish. Poorly scripted, with a creaky and sometimes confusing plot, it illustrated that however good an actor Rupert Everett may be he has little sense of comedy. Russell Brand was worse, not uttering one funny line and seeming curiously bored with the whole thing. The audience wasn't laughing much either on the night we went.Star names do not make up for poor direction and poor scripting, and someone forgot that comedies are meant to be funny. The original versions stand up even today - this version doesn't stand up for one day. And why were Girls Aloud included, and given a ropey song to sing in a key that was clearly too low for them to manage? Extraordinary! Massively disappointing.",St. Trinian's
82,cloudedvision,The Mischief Makers are back for another bash? (spoilers alert),10,7 February 2008,"It seems as though St. Trinnian's most infamous mischief makers are back in town... with even more entertaining tricks hidden up their sleeves! This modern twist on the old school films sheds a different light for the target audience. Instead of the practical route, of the old-fashioned DIY style aka (take matters into their own hands), the girls' themselves show distinguishable determination and courage (as portrayed through a lethal hockey game) to save the school from ominous threats of school government official, Geoffrey Thwaites. We have seen Colin Firth perform in his hero element as ""Mr Darcy"" and ""Mark Darcy"" in Helen Fielding's novel, Bridget Jones's Diary, but we haven't really seen him in a different starring role, formally known as the bad guy (or the villain).The girls' organisation and the introduction of the modern era's school cliques works rather well. The timing is classic and impeccable in this film particularly with the take on the Michael Cain famous quote from the Italian Job. Naturally, it won't be the same as the original, but the timing is still superb. The elements of dark comedy namely the ""skull with a knife"" and the amusing signposts dotted around add more humour and taint the school's reputation, before the protagonist even enters the place. Once again, obviously this new adaptation is not going to trigger the same spark as the original versions did, because this remake is set in the modern period. However, another interesting point, I'd say worth noting in this remake is how credible and convincing the expressions that spread across the new girl's face and her visible fear of being left are mingled in with nervousness of meeting the other boarders. How it is captured within a scene and how this gives the audience another insight - another teenager's horror and realisation - as to what living at a school must be like. Self-discoveries are made throughout this film and that's another merit and realistic point that is worth noting.The introduction of the different school cliques gives members of the target audience more of an insight as to what kind of challenges and hardships kids these days go through in order to fit in somewhere. One particular amusing scene half way through, where there is a unity and understanding between the mischief makers of St.Trinnian and the Head, Miss Fritton (who is performed by a British male actor, Rupert Everett... though, you'd never have guessed she was a he based on first impressions) evolves around an impasse between the teaching staff and the pupils. This scene highlights various issues of understanding and respect of an emotional level. This expression 'You may have won the battle, but you haven't won the war' ties in nicely with this film. After comparing it to the black and white films, which first introduced the memorable storyline, I have a feeling this particular updated version will be more memorable as some of younger members of the audience will be able to relate to the school cliques. These members of the targeted audience are more likely to be more compassionate.Honestly, I cannot see why anybody should be complaining about this film, when obviously, there are more condensed and disappointing films out there like the Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy and The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe, (which should have been made into a film series starting the first story).",St. Trinian's
83,shasslau,Defenders of Anarchy,7,29 March 2008,"I enjoyed this film immensely, not least because I'm an old codger with fond memories of the original St. Trinian's films. I'm probably not this films target demographic (which I suspect are teenage & preteen girls) so I was uncomfortable with what sometimes seemed to be over-sexualized depictions of the schoolgirls, this was offset though by a strong them of feminine empowerment, which may be taking the film more seriously than it is intended, but it is there. We have plenty of movie references for those that like that sort of thing, a good story, and plenty of old style St. T. mayhem updated for the 21st Century.I'm looking forward to a sequel.",St. Trinian's
84,paul-newman2,nothing to distinguish it from all the other 'reheated' ideas of the last 3 years,5,26 May 2008,"I feel a little outnumbered writing this, but I just couldn't get enthusiastic about this film. It's not by any means an appalling film, but, in my opinion, it simply failed to justify its existence.I have the somewhat contentious belief that if you, by which I mean pretty much every film studio, haven't had a truly original idea in 10+ years, then the last thing you should do is try to re-invent an unquestionable classic with 'flavour of the month/season/week' actors.Rupert Everett was probably the greatest disappointment in this movie, not due to alack of talent, but purely to poorly-developed material. Despite his abilities, Everett could never, with this script, hope to be anything more than an 'ersatz' Alistair Sim. While Russell Brand isn't nearly as annoying as his public persona from some time before the movie would have implied, he can't hope to duplicate the personable charm of George Cole, because such charm isn't something the new wave of British 'celebrities' are really attuned to in our glorious new age where 'chavscum' are the target audience for all entertainment.Overall a mildly disappointing, and fundamentally charmless film - not good/not bad, but ultimately pointless when you can buy the DVD set of the 4 original movies for the same price as this one.",St. Trinian's
85,Sophiaso,it doesn't worth to see it in the Movies,4,15 July 2008,"Well.. I have to admit, I didn't have high expectations about this movie, I would say I was averagely excited; if you expect more than an average movie, you won't enjoy the movie at all, instead, you'll find it a bit boring, full with clichés, etc. It isn't the worst movie (I gave 4/10), it's not even in my ""Top 10"" list of worst films. But: the acting was weak (I think this was one of Rupert Everett's worst performances. He wasn't funny, more likely, he was pathetic, unlike John Travolta in Hairspray, who has also played a woman character in that movie), the humor was okay, but I didn't laugh so often.. What I am proud of, I recognized the English teacher as Queen Gorgo in 300 (well, she didn't were on the screen for 10 mins total I guess, and also didn't give a flawless performance in this movie). The outfits? Well, I don't think that even a ""terrorist-like, so-not-into-law"" girl would be allowed to wear garter in a contest, or when the media and minister comes to the school. Anyway, the uniform was okay, the girls were not good in acting, but I saw worse performances, like I said before. The picture, the lightning was average, the scenes as well, not to mention the story (well, probably the film is not taking itself too serious, but it's funny how they steal a famous painting..) Soo, I would not recommend to go and see it in the movies; wait for the TV premier instead of paying for this film.",St. Trinian's

We, my girls and I, had so much fun, but I think I have to say that we finished school this year at a girl school, so for us it was just that easy to understand not only some hidden jokes, but also the situations.

I often wish i'd had the guts to do some of the things they did whilst I was at school but unfortunately being the goody too shoes I was I have to say I chickened out every time an opportunity arose.The make-over scene is one of my favourites, I love the stereotypical outfits each category of students wore and I think all of the girls looked brill in it.

Its not always good sometimes our life get crazy and messed up but in this movie you will see a great heart behind those rude things these girls do in life. Its also funny when Talulah Riley compared the school to Hogwarts, you'll see your fantasy on that scene. It makes audience feel weird as well. All in all its a good movie, funny, entertaining, the rude scenes are not that bad, I mean they'r okay. I wish I can go to this kind of school.

This time the motley crew of ungovernable girls have been brought up to date. Out goes knicker elastic catapults and in comes explosives, innocent flirting is replaced by money-making sex chat lines, distilling of vodka and taking drugs replaces contraband sweets and pop. Added to the traditional scraggy little monsters and sexy sixth-formers in gym slips and stockings are modern Brit-youth demographics: chavs, posh totties, geeks and emos (goths). The girls' black-market fixer, Cockney crook, Flash Harry, played by George Cole in the originals, has been replaced by TV comic Russell Brand. Doing a much better job than Cole  you really believe that he might have been a spiv in a previous life! The girls using their wit and ingenuity to save the school from bankruptcy by stealing the painting 'Girl With A Pearl Earring' from the National Gallery in London. Despite all this the students challenge bullying, snobbery and hypocrisy, work together to save their school and with the rest of the cast create some great humour. One of the best lines is from Talulah Riley as Annabelle Fritton who on arriving at the school announces that its like 'Hogwarts for chavs!'There will be those who will dislike the slapstick and indeed adult themes of this 12A rated movie.

Not only is the plot unbelievable, the characters are cliché with absolutely no character development. the main character is annoying and the change form nerd to cool kid is so sudden that you wonder did you miss some thing. The one thing that keep me going is the small hope that some how she enter and become the moral compass of the house, that doesn't happen she is soon daft into the realm of nonsense completely losing me. some may say that this movie is good for a few giggles, but truly I couldn't even crack a smile. I feel sick watching the so called feminism, watching girls, yes GIRLS perform what the audience can only imagine as sexual favor for men. I say girls because when in the movie the often refer to the school as college. I don't know what age people go to college in great Britain but six year old and what I can only surmise is 16-17 yr. old aren't in college, so an adult Russell Brand hitting on the ""heads girl"" is totally inappropriate. what is worst is that is not the only thing wrong with this movie. from the girls selling bootleg vodka that is killing people to the teachers only reason for being there is to prove that the decrepit build is indeed a school. coupled with fact that the head mistress is a man. and more moments like that. this movie is stupid.",St. Trinian's
91,mike-2340,A worthy Re-invention of a classic Comedy series,8,23 January 2008,"St. Trinian's is probably never going to top anyone's list of greatest films of the 21st Century but there's no denying it is funny. It could so easily have been terrible, but it isn't, thanks to a witty and clever script that pays tribute to Ronald Searle's original cartoons as well as to the classic ""Belles of St Trinian's"" Writers Piers Ashworth and Nick Moorcroft have successfully reinvented St. Trinian's for the 21st century, avoiding the obvious pitfalls  the school could so easily have been turned into a combination brothel and crack den  instead creating a world in which the girls can run wild. A world in which it seems no-one bats an eyelid at ten year old girls playing with explosives, but God forbid they should ever take up smoking.Rupert Everett is in fine form as the headmistress Camilla Frinton though admittedly he's no Alistair Simm (then again who is?) and Colin Firth is a more than capable straight man, quite happy to take pot shots at his own career. More surprisingly Russell Brand makes a very effective Flash Harry, While distinctly different to the original in both appearance and manner to George Cole, there his something indefinable about his performance, he could almost be the grandson of the original Flash.However where this film really succeeds is in the girls themselves. Talulah Riley is the heart and sole of the film as Annabelle Fritton, slowly blossoming from shy awkward daddy's girl into red-blooded St Trinian, and Gemma Arterton as head girl Kelly commands the screen in every scene she's in. Between them Riley and Arterton steal the move from under the noses of the more experienced Everett & Firth.But it's not just them, a combination of astute casting and good writing ensures that all the students come across as characters in their own right from twin terrors Cloe and Holly Mackie through to the 'Posh Totty', brilliantly underplayed by Tamsin Egerton, Amara Karan and Antonia Bernath.In years to come this film will be remembered not for the sight of Rupert Everett in drag but for giving screen time to so many of the next generation of starlets.",St. Trinian's

The social divisions of modern day Britain were faithfully represented in the film, with Chavs living alongside Emos at the school; however what is to be praised about the film is how the two conflicting groups ultimately unite to raise the money needed to keep St. Trinians open. Russell Brand is also brilliant in the film starring as rogue teacher 'Flash', and Stephen Fry's role as quizmaster proves to be hilarious.Lastly, may I add that this film is apparently not everybody's cup of tea. I cannot understand how certain members on this website can give the film 0 out of 10 starts - I just think that that's pathetically extreme.

98,exceptthis,Shocking,2,6 January 2008,"Incredibly disappointing. It wasn't funny, it wasn't entertaining and I want 1 1/2 hours of my life back. That the English Film Council supported this film is a disgrace. Basically it's full of smutty shots that indulge hormonal 14 year old boys, but the rest of the film is devoid of anything worthwhile. Compared to the comparative innocence and light humour of the originals this film doesn't even register on the radar. Colin Firth acted his part well, as did Rupert Everett and most of the ""well known names"" (Stephen Fry etc), but they had very little to work with. It's a shame they will be associated with this film.",St. Trinian's
