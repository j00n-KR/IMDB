0,nogodnomasters,We all make bad choices,4,3 July 2021,"The film is way too long. It has an interesting premise. Crime is out of control. They are going to the American Peace Initiative (API) which will send out a signal that will make it impossible to people to break the law if they know they are doing something illegal. Right before this happens our trio plan to perform a large heist of money. They have a device that will give them 30-35 minutes before they become activated. Once they score the money they will drive to Canada in a huge truck that will not be hard to locate. There is distrust within the group of three.The film had some interesting scenes, but overall they killed the plot trying to do too much.Guide: F-word, sex, nudity (Anna Brewster + uncredited car top dancer)",The Last Days of American Crime
1,kosmasp,Getting away with it (?),6,14 June 2020,"Or purge as long as you can. I think some may have taken a page or two of this, writing about Bill Gates wanting to put chips in us and all that. But conspiracy theories aside, the movie makes overall sense with trying to minimize crime. I am not famliar with the graphic novel this is based on, so I can't compare those things for you though.The beginning kind of sets the mood. This is over the top. Still as over the top as that seems, there is a scene that is odd to say the least. Actually being shot close range, should be the end of the discussion. But it is not - this is something that may break the movie for you. It is quite ridiculous to say the least, but it is what it is. Technically the movie works, the actors do their best for the kind of schlock it is they are in. Overall this is more than decent - it may be a bit too long, but other than that: good set pieces, great action and stunts and a decent story to hold it all together",The Last Days of American Crime
2,classicsoncall,"""So you want revenge. I want legacy"".",7,18 January 2021,"I can't believe the 3.6 IMDb rating this film has as I come here to write this. You same folks gave ""The Old Guard"", another Netflix project, a 6.6 rating, and that one is no better or no worse than this one. Not that you can't pick out the flaws, but for action/adventure fans, there's a lot of explosions and bloodshed to go around here. That's not actually what I come to a picture like this for, but you sort of have to go with the flow.So the working premise is that the government will soon implement what's called an API signal that will inhibit the criminal mind from committing unlawful acts. When the switch is thrown, all police authority in the country becomes moot, and the FBI remains in sole charge of maintaining law and order, such as it will be. As the date draws near, the window of opportunity for outlaws, and specifically the protagonists in this story, narrows for executing one last heist. Graham Bricke (Edgar Ramírez) is sought out by a crime kingpin's estranged son (Michael Pitt) via his sexy girlfriend (Anna Brewster), to join a convoluted scheme to rob a billion dollars in old and new money before the API signal is implemented.Granted, this film didn't require two and a half hours in the telling, but how else would Bricke, Kevin Cash (Pitt), and Shelby Dupree (Brewster) get into and out of so many impossible situations. Even a couple of FBI guys on the take have a hand in the story, making it possible for Shelby to rescue her sister from some situation that isn't made clear. With the clock running down, there are enough double crosses to go around in order to leave one last man standing. Well, make that one last woman standing.That API signal by the way, was described earlier by Kevin Cash, who said it was a molecular modulation of the pre-frontal cortex, which sounded to me a little like a lobotomy. Which reminded me of a line from one of my old time comic books about an interplanetary assassin named Nexus, who once said ""I'd rather have a free bottle in front of me than a pre-frontal lobotomy"". And as for the basic plot of the story, I do have a major reservation about the government implementing a program to void criminal behavior. I mean, how would Congress ever come up with a majority of it's members to ban what comes naturally.",The Last Days of American Crime
3,searchanddestroy-1,Not bad but...,6,15 July 2020,"I think this film could be seen as a kind of tribute to Maurice Dantec. Don't forget that Olivier Megaton the director already gave us LA SIRENE ROUGE, eighteen years ago, adapted from a Dantec's novel. Here, we have nearly the same anticipation atmosphere, if not the story itself. Not really a crime drama, but crime thriller with a bit od sci-fi. Too long but no boring though. Lousy shooting scenes, where hundreds of bullets are wasted against intact windshields and car doors. Edgar Ramirez reminds me a bit Oliver Reed in his forever suffering man. A nihilistic film which the end saves the whole thing. A donwbeat ending that prevented this feature to be released in theaters. so, once more, thanks Netflix.",The Last Days of American Crime
4,CinemaSerf,Smart looking but totally devoid of heart/soul/humanity and decent performances,4,23 June 2020,"Olivier Megaton deserves a special merit badge for this! The concept is quite interesting; the US Government has developed a signal that once transmitted will turn everyone into a goody-goody incapable of crime. Edgar Ramirez (""Bricke"") and his pals decide to commit the ultimate heist just before this permanent lockdown condemns them all to a lifetime of natural history programmes on television. The special merit? Well that is because given that quite interesting premiss, what we get is a truly dreadful, violent set of disjointed mini-adventures; shoot em' ups, car (or truck) chases with shallow characters about whom I truly couldn't care less. Ramirez and Neels Clasen (""Turner"") ought to have shredded the script on sight - long before it got anywhere near Michael Pitt who's performance is frankly risible. Of course it looks good, the tech folks have made sure the effects are (repetitively) top class and at times the soundtrack might send you to iTunes, but sorry, this is a shambles of a film that goes on way too long with little, if any, point to it.",The Last Days of American Crime
5,Wizard-8,Good premise badly botched up,3,7 June 2020,"When this movie came up on Netflix, I was really interested by its advertised premise, that being a future American implementing a system that will prevent people committing crimes, and a small group of people planning one last robbery just before that system kicks in. I hadn't heard of a premise like this before, so I was really interested to see how it would be depicted. But believe it or not, the movie doesn't really explore the implications and consequences of what would happen if such an anti-crime system was put into place. It wouldn't take much of a rewrite to make the story into a full caper movie, which is mostly as it is now. It's possible the movie might be able to be salvaged with the planning and execution of the caper, but there really isn't anything new with this portion of the movie. It just goes through the same tired elements such as double-crossing partners, corrupt law officers, etc. etc. Even when the movie tries to throw in some action, it still goes through the motions instead of being original and special. And as others here at the IMDb have pointed out, at two hours and twenty-eight minutes in length, the movie is far too long for its own good. All I can say that's positive about this movie is that it doesn't depict my country (Canada) with any real stereotypes when there are Canadian references. In short, the movie is yet another Netflix exclusive flop.",The Last Days of American Crime
6,trashgang,a few moments are okay but the first 90 minutes way too long,4,6 June 2020,"After a few brutal Netflix releases this was going to be the next thing and the trailer was giving away some nasty and bloody moments so off we go for another nasty Netflix.Starts really good and I thought, yes, it's going to be like Exctraction in your face brutal flick. Sadly after a few minutes into this film it drops below zero and in fact the first 90 minutes are way too long and even a bit boring. So 90 minutes of, let me say nothing.Once this starts it's getting better but way too late to make it a good flick.

7,cruise01,Last days of crime is not last with its overlong run time and uninteresting story.,5,6 June 2020,"The Last Days of American Crime (2.5 out of 5 stars).The Last Days of American Crime is a crime action thriller that may entertain with its mind numbing pointless gun shoot outs and gritty violence. But the story does take a back seat with uninteresting characters. And a concept that plays like a sci fi thriller. With the idea taking place in the future. Where law enforcement are planning to use a signal to stop people from committing crimes. That is where Brick (Edgar Ramirez) comes in. When he discovers his brother is dead in prison. He plans to get revenge by one last crime by robbing a money vault. With the help from Kelvin (Michael Pitt) and Shelby (Anna Brewster).The plot is boring. There is a twist with a character. The characters are forgettable and uninteresting. Brick is a guy who wants to get revenge for his brother. Kelvin is a want to be gangster who wants to commit a big crime to impress his father. And Shelby who is Kelvins love interest has her own personal agenda. While, officer William (Sharlto Copley) had a rough past as a cop. Sharlto Copley's character is very undeveloped.The film does have a decent amount of action to make this entertaining or its flashy direction. The film is over long for its running time. The first half was entertaining. When the heist is happening. It all comes crashing down a little too fast. Which makes it hard to keep interest in the movie.Overall, it was a pretty bad movie. The acting is dull. The characters are boring. The story and concept is messy and tedious.",The Last Days of American Crime

10,alindsay-al,A Pretty Awful Boring Film,2,5 June 2020,"This film hit Netflix today and I have had the chance to watch The Last Days Of American Crime and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a crew attempt to commit a heist just before a signal comes in to play to stop anybody from commiting a major crime.
Main Character
Edgar Ramirez plays the main character here and honestly I have never been a big fan of his, I just find him really boring to watch and this film is no different as he is such a boring lead character. There is nothing unique about him at all as a lead character and the film gives you no reason to care about him or why he is doing what he is doing so it leads you to become bored by him.
Supporting Characters
The great Sharlto Copley is in this film and when he is on the screen he is clearly the best actor here, I just don't really understand why he was here. His character plays no part in the plot really and it feels like a weird excuse to pad out the length by putting him in here. Anna Brewster plays Ramirez's love interest here and I mean she has the best motivations here, but they still don't work and I didn't care about their romance. There was just nothing there and no chemistry between the two performers to make it interesting or compelling. Michael Pitt plays there associate and he is that character who is just insane for being insane's sake, he has family issues but none of it is expanded enough for you to care and you really wonder why Ramirez's character even decides to work with him as it makes no sense.
Story
The premise of the film is pretty interesting but it is just executed so poorly, you don't care about the characters and the heist doesn't get the attention that it deserves so you aren't exactly clear why and what they are planning to do. There is a side plot with the police that isn't expanded at all and it feels like it is there for no real reason at all. The end of the film is crazy and tries to make you care about the characters but you just don't.
Script
The script is really boring here, the drama didn't connect with me or make me care about anything and there is literally no real humour making this a very sombre and frustrating experience.
Style
The style of the film has some decent action scenes that are really over the top making them fun experiences, it is just there aren't enough of them. Plus the film is 2 and a half hours which is absurd, it drags on to a slow painful death, the film should have known what it was and aimed for 2 hours or even a little less instead of dragging on with one of the slowest paced movies you will see all year.
Overall
Overall, this is a really poor film, so boring and so slow. It just about avoids a 1 rating because of some fun action scenes and Sharlto Copley but it was close because I was so bored watching this film and recommend nobody waste over 2 hours of there day with it.",The Last Days of American Crime
11,kwenchow,"Surprisingly not bored! A bit slow at the middle, but overall quite intense! Should watch it!",5,8 June 2020,"This film start with a man ""Bricke"" torturing another man with gasoline, and he explode the apartment scene! As turnout, this film is about Bricke team up with a crime boss son ""Kevin"" to steal one billion USD from the vault, while government launching the API signal to stop the crime! Entire film full of quite intense bloody shooting scene! Make the film quite watchable! The action scene in the film have, glass broken, explosion, car crash, burning, shot with bazooka, and bloody shooting! At the end, Bricke die after driving the truck full of money crossing Canada border with Dupree! Dupree pouring the ashes of Bricke's brother into the lake! She driving the car away with her sister! That's it! A quite entertaining film!",The Last Days of American Crime
12,Pairic,Confused SF/Noir,5,9 June 2020,"The Last Days of American Crime: A near future dystopian U.S., the government plans to broadcast a signal which will make crime impossible, attempted transgressions will result in a debilitating headache. (Don't ask it's not really explained.) Crime is rampant in the period leading up to the signal broadcast. bank robber Bricke (Edgar Ramirez) has messed up his chance to escape to Canada and his mob bosses have a hit out on him. He is approached by Kevin Cash (Michael Pitt) and Shelby Dupree (Anna Brewster), a consummate femme fatale, with a plan to pull off one last heist. A menage a trois develops as the film stumbles across sub-plots, unlikelihoods and non-sequiturs. Some really good fight scenes, shoot-outs and car-chases in the film but quite often they do not advance the narrative. Also gory and violent, some very disturbing scenes. There's a good film struggling to emerge from this morass but it would require a significant cut in the 149 minute running time. Directed by Olivier Megaton from a screenplay by Karl Gajdusek. 5/10.

13,s3276169,Whats the real crime?,3,14 June 2020,"Hollywood need to rethink its obsession with sleazy crime drama's. Case in question, ""The Last Days of American Crime"".We would wish this title were, in fact, a truism. That reanimating ""Natural Born Killers"" from 1994 in one shape or other would come to an end. That sleazy, cheesy, overcooked crime drama's that, are, in fact, ugly and depressing, could be locked away and the proverbial key, never found.Its a shame this reeks as badly as it does of a tired, desperate, loss of inspiration, that characterises many contemporary US screenplays. The cast is excellent, with the likes of Sharlto Copley (who I feel we don't see enough of) and Michael Pitt, on offer.Failing to take advantage of such a wealth of acting talent is, in my view, the real crime here. Whilst the performance's are mostly excellent no amount of quality acting can fix a tale this unlikable and uninteresting.3/10.",The Last Days of American Crime
14,elliotjeory,It didn't keep my interest,3,5 June 2020,It sounds like an interesting concept but unfortunately it falls into the seen-it-all before category. Cliche scenes and nonsense dialogue. No likeable characters and the main one has a one expression face which I found irritating. It won't keep your attention and it's not worth the time.,The Last Days of American Crime
15,Prashast_Singh,"Slow in the first half, stretched in the second. The action saves it.",6,8 June 2020,"Before I begin, I must remind you this is a typical heist action movie with an added futuristic twist. For the major part, I found myself enjoying it. The action sequences were in plenty and really well executed. But while I found the first half stretched, the second felt soulless for some reason. It fails to justify its overlong duration, but works for the most part.The Last Days of American Crime is no masterpiece. Especially given how it wastes Sharlto Copley and is needlessly dragged for 149 minutes. A film like this could've been easily an hour shorter like other straight-to-video, low-budget but gripping action movies. This is where the film falters. It's way too long for its own sake. The concept of eradicating crime is really impressive, and it seems to go well for the first two acts. However, the third act is where it spirals out of control. The last 30 minutes, though action-packed, feel exhausting, given how the story was already slow in the beginning. I couldn't feel anything by the time it ended.Nevertheless, the action is what saves the movie. Yes, it does. At least for action buffs like me, who were watching it for action. Olivier Megaton did a good job with the explosions, crashes and guns. And given that it fills most of the duration is why I liked it. It's not the best or worst action movie you'll see. It's just a decent one. Expect nothing but good action and that's all it has to offer. The lack of urgency or interest in characters is kinda off-putting. But if you can ignore that just for the sake of lots of action, you'll have a pretty decent time watching it.The Last Days of American Crime is a watchable action movie. Worth watching once, if you like the genre. Rest others can skip it.",The Last Days of American Crime
16,saptesh786,for API and do not judge with low ratings!,7,20 July 2020,"Wonder to see such low ratings. This movie is worth for 6 and above. Though half part is not remarkable later half or 60 % is watchable and interesting. All this part is full of thrill, action and tension gives you lot of moments interesting to watch. End is little unexpected. Movie is showing dark crime, corrupt FBI, nasty mafia and above all a attraction of API. A future government weapon to attack on your brain to come down crime rate. However this portion is not well narrating. As me once time watchable for action and thriller lovers. Do not go with low ratings.",The Last Days of American Crime

19,markthomassintek,I enjoyed watching it but I wouldn't recommend it.,4,15 June 2020,"REVIEW - THE LAST DAYS OFAMERICAN CRIMESet in the near future America has invented a mind controlling frequency called the API (American Peace Initiative).The frequency stops people form committing crimes and as this film follows a group of criminals planning and pulling of one last huge crime.In essence a very interesting and good concept with acting and action also excellent but.........NETFLIX has brought out a number of very good releases to their channel recently but unfortunately this isn't one of them, enjoyable but the story just doesn't make any logical sense and the characters are just repulsive grating you the watched at every opportunity, especially the silly love between the lead actor and actress, where did that come from?In essence just a silly action (almost futuristic) gangster film with absolutely no substance and I use the word silly politely because I could very easily be more harsh.So honestly watch this film for the action, the explosions, the shooting and the gore but don't concentrate on anything else because you will be sadly disappointed especially when 1 character gets covered with Diesel and doesn't burn and the same character later on gets shot in the stomach in point blank range and still survives!I know it's just a film but and maybe I'm being too picky but why create a 2-and-a-half-hour film to just waste your time will characters who just annoy you, a story that is just too silly for words and then ruined by ignoring the crime stopping signal (API) when it is convenient for the plot (truck driving at the end).I'm torn, honestly, I am, I enjoyed watching it but I wouldn't recommend it.Rating 4 out of 10",The Last Days of American Crime
20,lopezpatricia-06139,WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN and all the other loathsome characters in this awful film,1,5 September 2021,Kevin was the worst of a long line of crappy characters. The film was an hour too long. The story deviates so many unnecessary times from an implausible main story so that it's hard to keep track. The main story was stupid and full of holes. We were insulted that we lost 2h30min to this rubbish. Avoid as you would the covid virus.,The Last Days of American Crime
21,Xavier_Stone,Just all around bad,2,6 June 2020,"There is a brain signal, API which will supposedly stop crime and some bank robbers are determined to still rob banks. A decent budget but poor acting makes it look like a high school project.
The whole thing is just forced and makes little sense, lots of scenes are just there for no reason, and give no backstory or add to the plot or the characters motivations.
Maybe Netflix should create a X2 play speed if they are going to continue to purchase these types of films. I lasted 44 mins before I had to start scrolling, watched a few more scenes and the ending. Not much of an effort.
The low budget created lot of problems, from the police stations with 6 cops in them to the border crossing with 4 officers and highways without cars.
After finishing this movie made me appreciated how tough it is to make a good movie.",The Last Days of American Crime
22,TwistedContent,Way Too Long and Way Too Conventional,4,5 June 2020,"Netflix has blessed (or ""blessed"") us with yet another crime blockbuster, this time one directed by Olivier Megaton (""Transporter 3"", ""Taken 2"", ""Colombiana""), who's no stranger to action movies. The critical acclaim has never been real high for him, and, sadly, ""The Last Days of American Crime"" is within the same ballpark as all his movies before. Personally, this is my least favorite chapter in his filmography.In a not-too-distant future, as they put it, U.S. government is a week away from activating a signal that will make it impossible for people to go against the law, any and all law. It will do so via brain rape, just try lifting a gun or shoplifting a snickers and you'll freeze and shake uncontrollably. You probably can hear the sarcasm and irony already, so yes, I did not enjoy this movie a lot. Besides that particular interesting and far-fetched idea, it's a highly conventional and thoroughly mildly frustrating crime flick romp, featuring plot and characters based off ancient blueprints. Some characters are no more than a mere sketch, like the one given to the guy I was excited to see the most, Sharlto Copley. His storyline went down the mill and down the hill. First half an hour is mostly pure and simple exposition, and the action doesn't even change gears until 70 minutes into already. There's all the usual romance and subplots, all of which end up just about where You expect them. The melodrama at play here really ticks all the most typical and overused boxes. Movie's real enemy, though, is its runtime. It is way too long for its own good, way too long and featuring way too little, clocking in at 2 hours and 20 minutes & that's not counting titles. A story of this depth and this quality usually deserves maybe a 100 minutes, maybe, and even then it still is what it is. At the very least, I was expecting a good heist factor. Everything leads up to it, only for me to understand that it's the wackiest, most unexciting heist movie ever. Frankly, the heist plot and even the crime-stopping-signal plot matter very little in the big picture of ""The Last Days of American Crime"". They say the graphic novel this movie's based on, is great and all. I don't know about that, but the adaptation certainly isn't great.The Positives? Acting. No award material on the horizon, but decent portrayals of dry characters, with the highlight probably being Anna Brewster and Michael Pitt, though Pitt's character is not easy to like. Next positive would be big budget. Movie looks arguably good, though still, by all means, it's undoubtedly an uninspired blockbuster. Crisp, contrastive cinematography, sometimes overkilled in editing, we also got explosions, raging guns, crashes and whatnot. The typical drivel, it just happens to be well made here. And original score, soundtrack - also decent. For a big part, the movie is pretty macho, many male characters are like that, boys, and if there's one truth in this world, it's that boys will be boys. The original score, being rocky and bluesy, went hand in hand with that. As for the soundtrack, it reminded of ""Sucide Squad"", because it had good songs, but no good reason to use them whatsoever. ""The Last Days of American Crime"" ended with Depeche Mode's ""Personal Jesus"" - kind of a waste on a two-bit cliché ending like this one.It's a movie of no originality, but it's not exactly bad at being a well made conventional crime thriller, I mean as conventional as it gets, despite its sci-fi-ish backdrop. It shoots itself in all the rest proverbial knees by making itself a 2 and a half hour experience, major mistake there. Regardless of the runtime, but even more because of it, I don't recommend watching this brick of a movie. My rating: 5/10.",The Last Days of American Crime
23,mwilson1976,An ambitious movie that wastes its potential by turning into an action flick with little intelligence behind it.,5,10 June 2020,"Based on Rick Remender and Greg Tocchini's 2009 graphic novel of the same name, The Last Days of American Crime clocks in at a bottom numbing 148 minutes and will test your patience despite all the gory excesses that director Olivier Megaton and screenwriter Karl Gajdusek throw at the screen. The story focuses on career criminal Graham Bricke (Édgar Ramírez) as he struggles to get back in the game since the death of his brother Rory (Daniel Fox) in a robbery. Seeking revenge against those responsible for his brother's loss he teams up with fellow criminals Kevin Cash (Michael Pitt) and Shelby Dupree (Anna Brewster) to plan a huge heist, racing against the clock before a mysterious government-made signal threatens to put a stop to all crime for good. The movie was panned by critics who took exception to its violent content and depictions of police brutality in light of the George Floyd protests (during one brutal fight scene a police officer is shown choking someone). Sure, it has it's flaws, but it isn't as bad as the reviews make it out to be, despite the fact it tries too hard to be something it's not, and leaves viewers wondering about the central message. Rather than attempt to deliver on its intriguing premise (an America without crime, but different to other movies like The Purge), The Last Days of American Crime wastes its potential by turning into an action flick with little intelligence behind it.",The Last Days of American Crime

Quality.
Spectacular
The action scenes are spectacularly accomplished.

The entertaining turns so that you don't feel the two hours with twenty-nine minutes that it lasts.
It's about an individual seeking revenge for his brother's death, and the way to do it is by teaming up with his former cellmate and girlfriend to dock.
A simple view is a generic action story, the interesting thing is that it touches an ethical issue that is about releasing a signal that Inivides in the brain the trace of violence making it disappear, they remember that this premise and is touched on in ""The Clockwork Orange"" where the question stands out: Is this not against universal human rights?

26,joeyford-55342,Boring and WAY long - a perfect analogy of Netflix today,3,10 June 2020,"This movie was a waste of 2 1/2 hours. I am seeing a trend where these are getting air-time on Netflix. What happens is companies make these stinkers, they don't get a distribution deal so instead of going straight to DVD they sit on a shelf. Netflix is trying to pump up the number of movies they have available so they are funding anyone with a script and buying these old stinkers and putting them out on their platform. This move could have been better if an hour of talk was cut out. There were lots of speeches and conversations that were so silly the viewer laughed at the people made to say them. It is a European made movie about how bad violent America is in the future and Canada is the goal for all Americans to escape their life of crime. Some guys wanna steal money to make the trip. The FBI has come up with a mind control device that all Americans will wear and blah, blah, blah. It is a mess. The acting is fine and the nudity is fun but the script is a mess.

Alot of people panned this because of world events happening right now but even in good times this film is just rubbish. The plot is weak the finished product looks unfinished. The director must have slept thru the filming and the producer must have been absent aswell.. One can't help by wonder how films like this make it into production.. It should have been called ""That'll do"" because that's the general feeling this film gives off.. Like it was all made with a ""that'll do"" attitude. Netflix has lowered the bar on this one...
The real crime is the running time... Maybe that's why the movie sucks so bad because everyone behind the cameras were asleep!In short... You'll never be bored enough to enjoy this film. It's only good feature is edgar but even he can't save it. Definitely the worst film I've seen this year.",The Last Days of American Crime

It fails horibly.This definitely could have been good. I feel like it's b-movie plot and setting had just enough style and that (maybe) the original concept or screenplay ould have been good enough but some network exec got his hands on this, owed some favors out to other power's in the production world and tacked on a bunch of unnecissary bs to appease the lowest common denominator in terms of audience.

He has nowhere the look or skill to do so. For the love of God, someone push the hair hanging in his face off to the side. Oh sorry, was that supposed to make him look sexy and serious? Fail.
So I fell asleep 5 minutes in, missed 20 or so minutes (well missed nothing) and woke back up in time for the pathetic sex in the bathroom scene! They should be embarrassed at the joke that was! It's one of those sex scenes that you watch and if you've ever actually had sex know that there was no way those clowns were doing it! Not to mention how lame sex scenes are that show no skin. Anyway, that wonderful scene ends with him saying ""well what box did you just check off?"" She's replied, ""f#ck a loser!"" Oh good one! Great dialog and writing there guys!
Then he walks out and after struggling to listen to the conversation he has next while holding a gun in the face of the long greased back hair white guy, I just couldn't take any more of that garbage and promptly turned it off...Come on Netflix, you do certainly do better than this garbage!

First of all the runtime... why do you take 2,5 hours to develop and conclude this story without actually developing the story itself and its characters..?!
Directing...Olivier Megaton is actually a good director, but here he didn't pay too much attention in the editing or directing. Scenes are scattered and disconnected, with random parallel stories which do not deliver anything extra to the film. They just tire the viewer.
The violence... is only used to provide ""action"" to the slow-burn and dull storyline.
The story itself... the idea is not bad, the delivery and the stretch of the idea to make it a 2,5 hour long movie; yes that's very bad.
Acting...here it is actually 50/50. Some moments are rewarding but not enough to save this film.
Overall, I m rather upset that someone spent all this money to create such a time-consuming, violent and pointless movie. 2/10 , don't waste your time.",The Last Days of American Crime

Instead, this misfire went to making him and his cohorts appear just as unlikable and cutthroat as their contenders. Although if enough patience is given, the story sort of grows on you.

It is just a beautiful film, if you can say this about a film where's so much violence and blood. Beautifully produced, beautifully acted, beautifully directed. A beautiful story? Well it is not the typical Hollywood ending, perhaps people have a problem with this? That they are so much conditioned by Hollywood rules of telling a story? It is about the last days where crime is possible in America. About people who make a living out of crime and who are trying to protect their livelihood before their possibilities get taken away by society. The title says it all really. No more story is needed.

Just a revamp of typical action movie with a nostalgic Escape from NY flavor. Most of the supporting actors/actresses were pretty good. Brewster in particular. She almost made a really horribly written role shine. If you believed anything in the movie it was her. The premise is kind of goofy, the plot is also, but not so over the top as to be inane like so many action movies are today. Ramirez was just so wooden with his lines. It was like they cast a voice mail prompt for the lead role. Overdub his lines and this would have been a fun waste of an hour or so. A chance to revisit the 80s crime dystopia movies.

89,garynorton,Poor crime comic book graphic novel adaption,4,6 June 2020,"Set in a future where the government are going to go live with a ""signal"" to prevent people committing crime in a seriously crime-ridden future, a trio of career criminals seek to carry out the ultimate heist under the shadow of the ""last days of American crime"".The original comic Source material had a gritty visual style which has been lost along with its crime noir style to a tonally inconsistent and generically sterile product.
Another issue are the three main leads: ; none of whom resemble any of their original incarnations.
Putting aside those of us who might know what it's based on, Edgar Ramirez just looks glazed in boredom; Michael Pitt chews up scenery as an OTT spoilt son-of-crimelord-with-daddy-issues & Anna Brewster's femme fatale is sadly lacking any real sexual charisma which is needed for the part. Oliver Megatons direction is also far from enticing, which given some of his mediocre previous Efforts like Taken 2 & 3 and Transporter is hardly surprising.
To add to the various issues, Sharlto Copley pops up every now and again as a dumb cop
who would appear to have some intrinsic part to play in all this, but even his involvement left me thinking why did they have him in it at all? The big heist finale is also botched with little build up in tension or excitement - a crime which seems fairly easy to carry out and unbelievably executed.
I quite like some of Netflix movie production output, but they have more than their fair share of crap product and sadly this is one of the latter.",The Last Days of American Crime

91,dpbertrand-126-427929,Entertained me,5,14 August 2020,"Honestly, not as bad as I expected. Maybe it was the 0 rotten score or 3.6 rating that made me have such a low expectation, but I was entertained.I will say a lot of what people say is pretty accurate. The acting wasn't awful, but it wasn't always good. The story was a bit all over the place and some characters that you thought would have a bigger impact, didn't. The chemistry between actors were poor with only glimpses of what could have been. The movie also takes itself too serious. A little more tongue and cheek type of fun would have made some of this easier to watch.For what I thought was good, the action was alright. It reminded me of action from the 80's. A lot of people holding guns that can't aim, but still thought it was fun. It's kind of the same with the car chases and explosions, all over the top fun. Finally, I hated the villains in the movie, hated them. Why is this good? Because that means I couldn't wait to see them pay for being so annoying. Not saying they do, just saying they made me annoyed enough to make me mad. I always give credit to actors who bring out real emotion, and the real villains of the movie did that.All in all, its a wasted opportunity. I love the template of the story. Unfortunately, it wasn't executed well. I think the 3.6 and zero rotten score is not fair, but than again its a matter of opinion. It personally caught my attention enough that I was curious what would happen at the end.",The Last Days of American Crime

This rating also reflects my sympathy for actors: Michael Pitt, Anna Brewster, and Edgar Ramirez, who's work I respect, not only here, but on other productions of far better quality than this one.This movie has the same problem all Netflix action movies have: Good actors, on productions with bad storylines.

94,crom-dubh,"Much better than the score and reviews giving it a ""1"" would have you believe",7,15 July 2020,"This film to me proves probably more than any other that you can't trust most IMDB reviews or score for Netflix titles. For some reason, a lot of people just have it out for them, I think. That's the only way I can think to explain such a rash of incredibly low scores and dismissive, useless non-reviews. You've got a ton of people just saying this is ""boring"", with no qualification, one person even saying it looks like something Tommy Wiseau would make. Seriously? Such gross hyperbole. It's really infantile.Now I'm not saying this is a masterpiece or anything. The writing has some issues. The narration (which is most just at very beginning and somewhat quickly disappears) is pretty bad, and had me thinking of the narration in Southland Tales (not a good point of comparison for any film). The protagonist is not particularly well developed, I feel. It would be one thing if he were either portrayed as being sympathetic or more of an anti-hero, but we're not really given enough of either to make him seem compelling. He's just a little flat, and I'm not sure whether to attribute it to Ramirez' performance or just the way the character is written. That said, I thought some of the other characters were entertaining, particularly Kevin (Michael Pitt), who kind of stole all the scenes he was in.The biggest complaint I've seen of the film (although, again, few seem to actually want to talk about it like a grown-up) is that it's ""boring."" The film is a bit long (around 2.5 hours), and yes, it is a lot of set-up for the payoff. But that isn't to say nothing happens during the set-up. There are several sub-plots that are important, and I think anyone just dismissing the film as ""boring"" is probably saying more about their lack of attention span than the film itself. If you're looking for a simple straight-up crime caper, this is probably not the film for you. This film has an interesting premise and some good world-building that necessarily takes a little time to establish. As iffy as the writing sometimes is (especially the dialog), overall this really is a somewhat involved story, which is one of the film's best aspects.Criticism that the film is poorly made (see above comment re: Wiseau) is amusing at best. Again, while I wouldn't say this is masterfully directed, it's at the very least competent. The action is usually compelling, and there are a lot of scenes that have a good build-up of suspense. I never felt like I was watching something amateurish. This more than anything kind of makes me wonder what the agenda is of the massive amount of people saying such things about the film. What is their point of comparison? It seems more likely that there is some reason external to the film for them to be targeting it. But that's all conjecture, and ultimately irrelevant. All I can is that I strongly disagree and urge people to give this a shot and decide for themselves. Don't be dissuaded by the nay-sayers and the ridiculously low score (currently 3.6, which is laughable). I'd say this is easily in the 5-7 range, probably somewhere in the middle. I'm tempted to give it an 8 or higher just to offset some of the obvious troll votes, but I am going to give it a 7 which is the high end of what I think is reasonable and accurate to my experience.",The Last Days of American Crime

The film is supposed to take place in America, but almost none of the actors are American and it's very obvious that it wasn't shot in America. The lead and his brother are two different nationalities and have different accents. It's like the movie didn't even try. Horrible exposition and narration. It's like all anyone watches is the news so we can get bits of information here and there. The movie is well over two hours for Christ's sake. Not sure if the science is truly ever explained or if we're just supposed to accept that the government has the capability to stop all crime. Very little character development.

However, THE LAST DAYS OF AMERICAN CRIME begins somehow as MAD MAX ends... That's all I am gonna tell you about MAD MAX, an excellent movie by the way.But here is the thing. A thing that every single cigar smoker in the entire world knows. When you stop puffing on your cigar the glow of the cigar will die within 5 to 10 minutes depending on the quality of the cigar, but it will eventually die out.Our hero in THE LAST DAYS OF AMERICAN CRIME has tied up a bad guy in a bathtub full of diesel fuel and poured diesel fuel all over him as well. He then lits a cigar and places it in the bad guy's mouth before leaving him alone with his destiny. The idea is that eventually the glow will reach and burn his lips and the cigar will drop into the fuel and he will be burned to death... And yes, that happens. In fact, the diesel fuel in the bathtub explodes... BOOM BA DA BOOM... That's the opening scene for you.In reality, a glow of a cigar or a cigarette would never be able to light up diesel fuel, but that's an entirely different story. After our hero leaves the bad guy alone, with the cigar in his mouth and his hands tied to his back, all he needs to do is wait for a few minutes until the glow of the cigar dies out by itself...I guess what I am trying to say is that this film is kind of stupid.

Don't get me wrong it's not a bad movie in the sense of some but it could have been a lot shorter Than the 2hrs 29mins runtime and tightened up by adding a character who programmes the API (American Peace Initiative) In the first place and showing the ground work of it. As for the whole scene at the start of Bricke torching a guy in a bathtub only served to show him as a bad ass and nothing more.
The acting is ok, not great but sometimes a little over the top by supporting actors. The two shining lights I believe are the always excellent Sharlto Copley and not a bad performance by Anna Brewster (the fight between her and Copley in the API building is brutal).
The action is good though a little far fetched in places (no one can take a shotgun blast to the stomach And survive that long)

It is a well made film based on a graphic novel that is in a style of classic American crime and action films with a dystopia police state future. It reminds me of films like Shoot 'Em Up, Crank, Death Race, and Children of Men. It is great to see studios putting effort and budget into adapting non family friendly graphic novels.People really need to realize that giving such harsh reviews unnecessarily to films adapted from graphic novels will only discourage studios from adapting more comic books/graphic novels into film.Aside from a few slow moments in the film it is actually a decent crime action film that's well shot, well acted, and you can tell they took it seriously. Also Michael Pitt was great in this film and feel he was the stand out actor in his role.I've read a lot of negative reviews based on police brutality and riots being in the film which is the dumbest excuse to give a film negative reviews.

This is not such a movie. I feel like this movie got a green light based on the title and a one page pitch...and then the writer ran out of ideas. A story about the last possible crimes before a neurological device stops the entire country from acting on criminal impulses is a GREAT premise! How did this device get distributed? Who stands to gain from the end of crime? Why does Michael Pitt's character have such a jacked up relationship with his family? If people are going to murder their immediate family, the audience needs to know WHY. There are so many questions that go unanswered in this movie. In fact, there is not ONE plot device that makes sense. There is not ONE storyline that satisfies. There is not ONE character worth caring about.I'm offended that this movie was even made, it has the production value of a decent budget, yet it seems to have been written and directed by unimaginative middle schoolers. Middle schoolers with a VERY RICH PARENT.If you're old enough to remember Pia Zadora's ""Butterfly,"" this movie is worse than that! Butterfly was a vanity project starring the talentless Zadora and financed by her crazy-rich, super-old husband. It featured father/daughter incest Story treated with inexplicably romantic gauze-over-the-lens soft focus. Until this, it was the worst movie I've ever seen. I'd watch that tripe again to avoid seeing this again.....So I have a couple of questions for the producers of this film. 1) Where did the money come from? 2) HOW did you get the very talented Michael Pitt to sell his soul for this dreck? Is he deep in debt? Was he blackmailed? 3) Why is it that in an industry where so many super talented women and minority writers and directors are struggling to get a break, this Megaton hack is still able to get financing? Please let this be his last picture. In addition to some of the worst directing this side of ""Showgirls,"" this director had the audacity to clock this trash in at 2.5 hours!

Really?,1,16 June 2020,"A, I'm guessing, tough monologue from our man about going through the extra trouble to get diesel instead of regular gas to pour over someone because ""it burns slower"". Which for some reason is supposed to be scarier than a quick burning fuel. Him not realizing that diesel fluid won't ignite with a simple lighter or a burning cigar and regular gas would have been a much better choice if you're going to set someone on fire because it evaporates much easier. It is not the liquid fuel that ignites but the vapours being released as the fuel evaporates. So basically the victim could have just spat out the cigar into the bathtub full of diesel and the cigar would have gone out as if it had been dropped in water.
Now, it could have been that our man is new to the burning people business and doesn't know these simple facts, for which he could be forgiven. But somehow the diesel doesn't only ignite, it also causes a major explosion, a remarkable feat considering how slowly diesel evaporates at room temperature and how long its vapours will sub-sequentially take to reach the LEL (Lower Explosion Level) concentration, especially in a bathroom with some big bloody holes in the walls that cause extra ventilation.

The story is stupid (but not in a good way).
The dialogue is awful.
The acting is bad.
There isn't a single character who's even slightly likeable.
There is nothing positive to say about this film.
The only thing I can say in its defence (and it's still not a positive point) is that most of the people involved haven't made many films before or haven't made a film in a while - probably with good reason - so that might excuse how bad it is to some extent (though the director has some okay stuff on his record - I can only assume he's been in jail for a few years and now he has money problems).If there is one positive to take from this film, it's this: if this is the standard you have to reach, anyone who wants to make a film could make one. Don't lose hope. You too could make a terrible, terrible film and still have Netflix promote it so much that people will give it a go. I imagine some people even managed to sit through the whole thing. Not many, but probably some.Disclaimer: the last hour and ten minutes might be the finest piece of cinema ever committed to film.

It was way too long, fairly predictable, was filled with bad acting and cliche dialogue. It was obvious the director and writers were trying really hard to make a slick, stylized movie, but it all came off really flat. None of the characters were at all likable, and very little real insight was given into them or their backgrounds, so they just came off very flat. Very little of the movie was actually about the proposed crime/heist, which would have been fine if the rest of the movie was interesting. One thing which really bothered me is some of the bad accents. Actors seem to slip in and out of various European accents throughout the movie without any in-movie explanation as to why this would be happening. I can only assume it's the result of actors from other countries doing their best american accents part of the time, and giving up at other times.",The Last Days of American Crime

231,couchpotato2k,"Painfully, Regrettably, Unnecessarily Awful",1,16 June 2020,"There's the adage that once you've hit bottom, you should stop digging. This movie hits bottom, and then goes down another few hundred feet, and then sinks lower. Seriously. This one film may hasten the invention of eye bleach. If you've read all the online reviews from every available cinematic media source, you'll find a level of negativity for this film usually reserved for environmental contamination disasters and presidential elections. Don't believe me? Go ahead and check - I'll wait.This movie is an exercise in brutally-executed tropes, toxic masculinity and audience masochism, with no redeeming quality whatsoever. It manages the impossible, both in leaving gaping plot holes while at the same time being entirely too long. There's no sense of continuity, logic, a cohesive structure, and not a single character is remotely well-developed or explained. But wait - it gets worse.One caveat: I have an all-consuming thing for Édgar Ramírez, intense enough that if he knew about it, he'd reasonably seek a restraining order. I've tried to watch every film he's been in a couple or, you know, fifty times. I'd watch him sorting his socks. He is a gifted actor whose greatest strength lies in playing people who have actually existed: Bolívar, Carlos the Jackal, Versace At the start of his career, he was sadly typecast as either ""Priest"" or ""Operative With Gun."" Trust me, he is a versatile talent - you just can't tell at all from this one movie. You can practically sense Ramírez struggling with this script, trying to channel - something, anything. It's painful to watch. I just want to snatch him out of this film, take him home and give him some soup. Don't worry, I'd gently reassure him, ""Wasp Network"" comes out soon, and others will be distracted when they see you in ""Jungle Cruise,"" should that ever be released, plus your attorney called about that protective order - would you like some more soup?He is not alone in his struggle. There is a regrettable love triangle - oh, so regrettable - and it involves Michael Pitt, who is desperately trying to channel someone himself. I'm not sure who, though. Is he Jack Nicholson in ""The Shining""? Is he Joe Pesci in ""Goodfellas,"" or maybe Christian Slater in ""True Romance""? Is he Mel Gibson at a DUI stop? I'm still not certain - someone please throw in here, I need some references. Is he Joaquin Phoenix as The Joker? Or is he River Phoenix decrying the use of any animal products whatsoever while quietly supporting drug dealers all over L.A.? Throw me a bone - I'm open to any and all suggestions.The third member of the love triangle is Anna Brewster, in a hybridized role as Manic Pixie Demon Girl, Official Online Hacker Chick, and Probably Mostly Likely Femme Fatale-Ish (Maybe). I get for the sake of the plot line that they had to squish a whole bunch of characters into one role, but that doesn't mean it worked. For someone with this many facets to her personality, she is surprisingly two-dimensional, and is barely holding onto that second dimension with acting this flat. She doesn't really - yeah, her sexy is questionable, her tech genius is implied rather than apparent, and she's most reminiscent of a PMSing Asia Argento crossed with a rabid squirrel. Got to hand it to Ramírez, though - they're both covered in blood and stink, she's puking her guts out, and they still manage to kiss one another deeply before sex. Yuck. Maybe that's cool if you're into that sort of thing.Rounding out the main cast is Sharlto Copley. I'm still not sure why he's in this, or what his character did to advance the plot. I'm not sure he knows, either. I think there's an unwritten law: When shooting a film featuring an urban dystopia, you have to use South Africa. And if you're filming anything in South Africa, you have to employ Sharlto Copley. Doesn't matter if it's based on an Edith Wharton novel or if it's a corporate training film, if it's anywhere near Jo-Berg, you'll see Copley in it.Other people have pointed out all the obvious flaws in this film, yet I still think they missed a couple. The bad timing in terms of current events and police brutality is probably the biggest gaffe mentioned - and it's several steps over the line of cringeworthy. Maybe the filmmakers or Netflix should have agreed to bury this for a few more months. There's a death ray being deployed by the U.S. government that is some sort of synaptic blocker to prevent all crime by making it neurologically impossible to do anything ""bad,"" but I guarantee that anything that pervasive would prevent pretty much anything business-related, from insider trading to the next WeWork. The economy as we know it would come crashing down, which is the opposite of the stability the government seeks by eliminating crime. This prospective mind-controlling dystopia makes Gilead look positively bucolic. And messing with brain chemistry like that seems like a lawsuit, between the risk of aneurysm, brain lesions or the rapid onset of disorders like multiple sclerosis or Lewy body dementia. Of course, good luck finding any competent attorney to bring a lawsuit with anyone being unable to think or do anything ""bad.""The one theme that still hasn't been explained has been the sibling attachment that seems so prevalent in this movie. Ramírez's character cares deeply about his brother and is devastated by his brother's apparent suicide. Brewster's character betrays both Pitt and Ramírez for her own sister's wellbeing. Yet, there's no similar attachment to parents or children or even longterm romantic partners. That leaves Pitt's character's family as the most vile and dysfunctional of all, since he happily bumps off both his father and his sister, as his sociopathic father offed both Pitt's mother and stepmother (after Pitt had both introduced his dad to Wife No. 2 as well as having slept with her). It's very Oedipal, this whole dynamic, and I'd suggest therapy, though Pitt seems to have a fairly perceptive knowledge of the psychological machinations at play. If he was already in therapy, apparently he wasn't in it long enough. Or it didn't take.It is thoroughly difficult to adapt novels, graphic novels and comic books to the screen. There's a lot that's lost in the transition, and some adaptations are a lot better than others. This film seems like it wants to be ""Sin City,"" with a heist that's sort of ""Ocean's Eleven"" (or ""Twelve"" or ""Thirteen"") with a little bit of exposition like ""Children of Men"" - so maybe someone should have watched those films instead of just reading their descriptions on Amazon. This isn't even a fun bad movie, it's just a sad bad movie. The whole progression of the underlying story is pointless, a blind alley ending in a brick wall. The best that can be hoped for with this hot mess is that there won't be a sequel, since two of the main characters are pretty much dead. I think. Given that the writer/director worked on the sequels to other action movies, that's not a for-sure thing - we can only hope and pray.",The Last Days of American Crime

Yea I had seen that no one has given it a good review and that rotten tomatoes had even given it a infamous 0% score! All the same here we go. Oh and I will not give anything away from the film.First off it starts well. It still has that element of comic book to it. So that's a good start. The cast is......... ok. Anna Brewster who plays Shelby Dupree for me did steel the film. Every scene she is in she showed that she could do much better things. The rest of the cast I am sorry to say just could not match up to her. Was that down to their acting or the writing of the film? Not too sure.The story just did not flow that well. It kind of stop started a lot. I feel if more time was put in to it then it would have run better.So I guess it comes down to why I gave it 8 out of 10. A big part has to go to Anna Brewster. I can not wait to see what she does next. Another part is when time was taken on action scenes it was done well. It is mostly the parts in between. Is it a possible cult film? No. It will not win any critics around as well. For me I sat down having read so many bad reviews and found it was not that bad! I will watch it again at some point but in the mean time it was interesting film. Well done Miss Brewster.,The Last Days of American Crime

I mean most of the Oscar's winning movies are really slow and loooong and people seem to enjoy it for some reason.. this one is more of an hybrid between the fast and the furious and that John wick movie.. right at the middle and end of the movie it gets faster if that's the issue.. if you think it's slow, just hang in there until the middle thing and it will get better.. some acting could be better and some plots could be better but it's definitely above average..",The Last Days of American Crime

Everything is explained in this movie, irritatingly so when the plot itself is simplistic and can be summarised in the opening six minutes or so: America irredeemably bad - Canada unquestionably good. Government and order unquestionably bad - anarchy and disorder, revered and praised. It is an interesting concept certainly but is executed so poorly, so hamfistedly and so condescendingly of the audience that it is a painful, and laborious viewing.

306,rachelparkerlu,Not great but okay gritty action film,7,6 June 2020,"I disagree somewhat with all the bad reviews; this was not run-of-the-mill and actually had some interesting ideas behind it. The big flaw is that it is clearly too long - it should have lost 30 minutes or more and sure, some scenes are pretty badly done. Yet on the whole I thought it was an okay watch. I admit I did not quite follow all the ins-and-outs of the heist, but that didn't really matter. Neither did the occasional plot holes or inconstancies. They obviously went for a very gritty, bloody action film and it certainly is that.
I was expecting the idea of the 'API', a transmission that affects the mind to prevent law-breaking to just be a McGuffin, but it turned out much more interesting than that. There are shades of 'Clockwork Orange' in some of the ramifications. And there's plenty in this film about the power and motivations of government agencies, which have a lot of resonance right now. I would also mention the excellent acting performance of Anna Brewster bringing more complexity to the girlfriend role than you' expect.",The Last Days of American Crime

312,danielhawkins-19522,Nothing about this film makes sense.,1,7 June 2020,"Firstly the film fails to explain any of the societal context in a coherent way. It's set in some kind of dystopian future USA but it doesn't really say how or why this future occurred so the story was on an unsteady foundation from the start.None of the characters back stories are fully explored and you are never really sure who they are, what their motives are and what they hope to achieve--people just seem to be passively going along with the plot for no real reason other than 'yay crime'. It feels like one of the early GTA games where the character runs around aimlessly doing whatever crime other people tell them to.Brick, the lead character lacks any real depth- he is supposed to be motivated by vengeance, although it's not quite clear how he will achieve this though the heist. However, he fails to really show any flicker of notable emotion during the entire 2.5 hour movie.The film is so disjointed it really is impossible to follow and enjoy. It leaves you feeling of confused and frustrated.Overall the writing is just terrible and I would recommend watching any of the purge movies if you had a taste for a dystopian crime/horror of this nature on Netflix. (I'm not saying the purge is great, but it's better than this).",The Last Days of American Crime

1) They had casting issues all around. The aesthetic was pretty good, but the accents and performances were off.2) They took too many liberties with the storyline. They changed the ending. They eliminated a character that was integral to the ""ol switcharoo"" ending of the comic and created two characters in her place.3) They added too many subplots and the movie ceased being a Sci-fi heist movie and forgot what it was.4) It was too long. They didn't know how to fill the time and it showed.This movie deserves a reboot.

It's the movie playing in the movie ""The Last Action Hero"" that starred Arnold Schwarzenegger.So lame you Internet people wouldn't get this style of movie. It has such a low rating bc people think they are Siskal and Ebert. I just read Ebert's review and you are all writing exactly the same review. No, that doesn't mean you are ""right"". It means you have no opinion whatsoever. Same old stuff I hear from critics about all movies. Well, I grew up enjoying watching movies. It used to be fun to watch over exaggerated representations of people. Movies are junk, it's entertainment. Why did everyone start watching movies as a way to understand life? Movies do not represent REAL LIFE. Movies are fake. They are supposed to not make sense. It's for fun. The rules of physics don't exist. Also... you know why you can't enjoy this movie.... B/c you take everything so LITERAL! The movie is being IRONIC. Learn how to spot these two words I just capitalized. .....I have to type paragraphs out as if I were addressing babies bc you all keep dwelling on dumb ""quickly punched in words"" that nobody thinks twice about, that people leave as their comments (half assed thought out comments). You have a problem if you are sitting here, voluntarily, reading words that ""hurt"" you. Anyways, back to literal and ironic, I know these are two very common words you Internet people always use incorrectly. Learn their meaning and you'll finally ""really"" wake up you dungeon gopher in grand makeup disguises, brainwashed backwards minority, as in a SMALL percentage, words have more than one meaning based on how the person uses them in a sentence.

I really proves that rather than paying for a good script, Netflix spend their production money buying cheap ones, and then use the budget to pay a half well know actor/actress to sell it and attract dumb viewers...
Thanks Netfluck (😉) for transforming an art (the 7th) into a product!",The Last Days of American Crime
354,rumaynes,2.5 hours of your life you will never get back,2,6 June 2020,"I'm an avid movie watcher and have sat through countless hours of boring movies, the two best things about this film was the trailer and the fact that it eventually finishes (after 2.5 long hours) it's so slow, mundane and drags out a interesting plot/storyline so much it makes a mockery of modern day film making.......poor watch",The Last Days of American Crime

357,jbrownvr6,For the Dummies who don't understand this movie.,7,13 October 2020,"This movie serves one purpose and it does it well. Predictive Programming. The film shows you what your future is about to look like living under a One World Government under total lockdown. It will be a cashless society, with a social credit score. The government (soon to be World Government) will control your life just as depicted in this film.So to the latent retard who can't make sense of this film... I just gave you the scoop. Now go educate yourself on these matters so you can understand what is coming next in real life. Hint: Movies and films tell you what's coming ahead of time... hence Predictive Programming.The power that be believe in Karma or cosmic law. They must tell you their intentions ahead of time and if you do nothing to stop it... the blame falls solely on you! Because you were told is some fashion (book, movies, TV) but failed to make the connection, or heed the warning.You've been told through numerous avenues that a NWO is coming, and for many years.",The Last Days of American Crime

363,buysomeflowers,It could have been good,3,10 June 2020,"Good idea for a movie, now that writing about viruses is a tired theme. It gives us something new to worry about. It felt like all those scenes with Michael Pitt belonged to a much better movie. He is a brilliant actor but no human can save us from promising Netflix's catastrophes.",The Last Days of American Crime
364,menab94,Dont let reviews fool you. A bit long but a fun watch.,7,9 June 2020,"I agree that the storyline may be streched out a bit thin and its no small commitment to put the amount of time you could dedicate to a classic from scorsese or tarantino, into a quarantine-induced watch of the action-flick netflix has to offer. But that doesnt mean the movie is garbage at all. The action sequences are convincing and fun (sometimes funny) with a great character build by michael pitt (natural born killers meets taxi driver) and a decent performance by ramirez when he does speak too much. The concept of the story is a bit far fetched but you learn to resonate with it as the world is unraveled. Car crashes alla michael bay-esque and a love tringle you're not sure what to make of complete the piece you probably watched already and are trying to convince yourself it wasnt that bad after all.

He was the perfect actor for Funny Games and this movie is worth watching if you have the time and drive to laugh with Michael Pitt. He knew what he was doing. It doesn't hurt that he's a sexier version of Kurt Cobain either .",The Last Days of American Crime

The only comforting thing is that I'm not an idiot and not alone! The characters are shallow, plot, writing directing, editing, acting, all horrible. It's 2.5 hours of non sensicial... Stuff...
