0,MartinHafer,"This film will make you uncomfortable....very, very uncomfortable.",8,31 July 2016,"When the film begins, a pedophile is chatting with a very young looking girl, Hayley (Ellen Page). Soon, she agrees to meet him at a coffee house and the guy is super-creepy as he pretends to care about the girl and her interests. Soon, he's convinced her to come home with him and you can only assume he's going to molest Hayley. However, Jeff (Patrick Wilson) soon learns that while he thinks he's in control and will be raping the girl, he's soon drugged, trussed up and being physically and emotionally tormented by Hayley. Surprisingly, this makes up at least 80% of the film...80% where this older than her years girl torments Jeff and makes him wish he was dead, as death would be easier than dealing with Hayley and her 'games'.This is a super difficult film to watch and I strongly advise you to think twice before you watch it because of the subject matter. If you've been a victim of sexual abuse, I could easily see the film's content bringing up horrible flashbacks...same with anyone who has been tortured. It cannot help but push the viewer's buttons. Additionally, many who haven't been through this might also want to beg off watching this one...it IS intense and often hard to watch. It is NOT a film for the squeamish. However, despite these warnings, the film is able to balance physical violence...not showing too much and often leaving the worst of it to your imagination. My only reservations about the film, other than the violence, is that I would have loved to know more about Hayley--especially since she doesn't talk or act like the 14 year-old she's supposed to be in the film. She's more like a 20-something with her clever puns and verbal dexterity. Plus, WHAT IS HER MOTIVATION? While none of this ruins the film in any way, it does leave you wondering.For the right audience, this film is exquisitely made and worth seeing. Also, I was surprised with the film as there was a line about Roman Polanski. While he IS a convicted child rapist, so often Hollywood has somehow excused this...but ""Hard Candy"" certainly doesn't!",Hard Candy
1,Leofwine_draca,A film that drops the ball...and then some,3,25 July 2016,"HARD CANDY is one of those films that I have a particular reason for hating: it has the potential to be a really good, tight little film, but it loses its tempo around halfway through and completely falls apart, meandering along until it reaches the inevitable, non-shocking climax. I think directors who make two-handers are playing a very risky game: when done right, they can be brilliant pieces of cinema, and when done wrong they turn out fairly abysmal. Maybe I'm disinclined to like them, because I know a lot of people like this film, and a lot of people like LOST IN TRANSLATION too, another film I hate.It starts off on good, strong ground, tackling an issue that plagues western society today: a young, underage girl meets an older guy on the Internet, and goes back to his house for who knows what. Is the guy a paedophile? It's the suspense generated by this question that keeps us watching, and then the film throws in the first big twist, regarding the girl's intentions. It's a good one, and it leads, slowly but surely, to one of the most harrowing sequences ever put on film – for male viewers, at least. The suspense is driven to breaking point during this taut, unpleasant sequence. And then...Then the film blows it. It went so far, then it turns chicken and runs away from what it set up. The ending doesn't turn out to be an ending at all but another forty minutes of dragged-out shenanigans that mix unbelievable physical antics with muddled psychology. The film is so mishandled that the key reveal – as to whether the guy is a paedophile or not – is fumbled and you're left scratching your head instead. The last scenes do finish with closure, but it's unbelievable closure and by this time you just can't believe the characters would act this way.I can't make my mind up on the acting. There's nothing to dislike from Patrick Wilson – he plays a guy constantly reacting to what's going on, and I couldn't fault him as he runs the gamut of emotions from icy fear to red-hot anger. Ellen Page takes the difficult role of the teenage protagonist, and she plays it fairly believably for the most part, but there are times when she feels like she's acting, rather than living the character. Director David Slade needs to go back to film school. His insistence on shooting most scenes in extra close up is wearying in the extreme, and just reminds the viewer of this film's low budget nature. HARD CANDY is an interesting film, yes, but in the end the flawed execution brings it way down.",Hard Candy
2,SnoopyStyle,disturbing with good performances,7,7 December 2015,Fourteen year old Hayley Stark (Ellen Page) meets photographer Jeff Kohlver (Patrick Wilson) at a coffee shop after some time chatting online. She's flirtatious and he takes her home. She makes them drinks and Jeff tries to get her to pose for him. Jeff has been drugged and passes out. He's tied up as Hayley accuses him of being a pedophile. She finds pictures of missing girl Donna Mauer. Judy Tokuda (Sandra Oh) is the next door neighbor.This is a disturbing movie. It's creepy at the beginning and then it flips the script on the audience. Page and Wilson are essentially in a two person play. Page is very engaging and Wilson is great. The middle is stretched out a little with the exception of the insane castration scene. Wilson really earns his pay. There is a need for a ticking clock to heighten the tension. Maybe a maid is scheduled to come. The tension isn't at its highest without the structure. This is an unique crazy memorable movie.,Hard Candy
3,Prismark10,Little sweetheart,7,19 July 2014,"In Hard Candy, Patrick Wilson plays Jeff a photographer who meets a smart 14 year old girl, Hayley (Ellen Page) in an internet chat room and sets up a date.They seem to share a similar taste in music such as Goldfrapp, Coldplay and both seem to be Anglophiles, Monty Python are name checked for example as well as British pop groups. Jeff is intoxicated when he meets the precocious Hayley and soon takes her to his apartment which is decorated of photos of young models. Hayley mixes some alcoholic drinks and Jeff wakes up tied to a chair as the seemingly underage girl is not what he thinks she is.Ellen is looking for the abductor of her friend and has been stalking Jeff for a while with cat and mouse games and confronts Jeff directly with his peadophilia.Wilson plays an almost early 30s nice guy but lurking inside him is a monster. He is so plausible and nice when he is interested only in deflowering underage girls and maybe even worse.Page has the hard act of playing an innocent girl and tough avenger who wants to unmask Jeff, show him his true self and find out what happened to her friend. The film is intriguing, interesting, uncomfortable and tense. Some parts might be over the top but its a film that should not be ignored.",Hard Candy
4,claudio_carvalho,Sick Girl,6,20 April 2007,"After three weeks chatting with the thirty-two years old photographer Jeff Kohlver (Patrick Wilson) in Internet, the fourteen years old Hayley Stark (Ellen Page) meets him in the Nighthawks coffee shop. Hayley flirts with him in spite of the difference of ages and proposes to go to his house. Once there, she prepares screwdriver for them and Jeff passes out. When he awakes, he is tied up to a chair, and Hayley accuses him of pedophilia. Jeff denies, and Hayley begin to torture him, in a mouse and cat game.""Hard Candy"" is an unpleasant story very similar to Roman Polanski's ""Death and the Maiden"", only the motives are different, political versus pedophilia. This film is well acted, and both Ellen Page and Patrick Wilson are superb in their performances. However, the sick and deranged Hayley Stark is a vile, no matter how despicable Jeff Kohlver might be. In ""Death and the Maiden"", the character of Sigourney Weaver was a political activist that was tortured by the character of Ben Kingsley, therefore the viewer is able to accept her revenge. But in ""hard Candy"", Hayley Stark is sicker than Jeff Kohlver and it is impossible to feel any sympathy for her character. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Garota Má.com"" (""Bad Girl.com"")",Hard Candy
5,nogodnomasters,PARTY TIME IS OVER,8,5 May 2019,"Jeff (Patrick Wilson) takes photos of under aged teen girl models for a living. He claims to be a professional and not cross the line. He meets 14 year old Haley (Ellen Page) on line, a girl overly mature and intelligent for her age. She convinces him to take her to his house for a photo shoot. The next thing you know, Jeff is tied to a chair with Haley making accusations about his possible misdeeds involving a missing girl.This film has the feel of an old fashion home break-in...you know the B-movies where the girls jump on the bed and ransack the house. This film takes the B movie to a higher level. Okay, pedophiles are bad, but the film started to get dragged down at making the point. They needed a longer build up and less end game antics. I also think the film would have been better if it had starred Chris Hansen instead of Patrick Wilson.Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. Adult themes.",Hard Candy
6,kosmasp,Strong,8,6 May 2007,"Everything about this movie is strong. The lead performances, the set-up and story etc. Not for the faint of heart or people who can't stomach a thriller to touch hot topics and spin them around, so you don't know what to believe or not to believe. To say anything more about the story, would be spoiling it for you, as I see it. I went in the movie without knowing anything. And I mean anything at all, except that I'd watch a thriller! That's how I'd like you to watch this. Just go see this movie (or rent/buy it and watch it at home) and be prepared for something that will blow your mind away! One of the finest pictures in the year 2006. And although I think it had it's flaws (suspend of disbelieve at one/two things or you could call them script flaws) it's still a must watch!",Hard Candy
7,gavin6942,Creepy But Brilliantly Creepy Film For Kids Today,8,20 December 2009,"An older gentleman and a 14-year old girl who were friends on the Internet meet at a local coffee shop, and as the day progresses, they go back to his house where we find that he is a photographer. Although the creepy levels of the film are pretty intense from the beginning, the film finds a way to get even more disturbing as it goes on.I wanted to see this film after hearing that director David Slade would be directing ""Eclipse"", the third ""Twilight"" film. I had already seen ""30 Days of Night"" and enjoyed it. Would they really give a teen franchise to someone who made a film about blood-thirsty vampires? As it tuns out, they also gave it to a guy who directs a film with castration and pedophilia. This makes ""Eclipse"" look like it has great potential.This film can be summed up in one word: creeeepy. Not just creepy, but creeeepy. If you want to see a 30-something man trying to pick up a teenage girl, this film will show you his every move. And it gets creepier from there. This film is a cautionary tale for both pedophiles and young women. The Internet is an amazing tool, but it can also lead to some horrible misadventures if you're not careful.Ellen Page is awesome. I don't think she will ever outdo her job in ""Juno"", unless maybe in ""Whip It"" (which I have not and will not see). But here is a role she should go down in history for playing, as it really is intense.The band Goldfrapp is mentioned, both lovingly and disparagingly. I have no opinion on Goldfrapp. I just find it interesting of all the bands in all the world, this one was singled out.",Hard Candy
8,jboothmillard,Hard Candy,4,21 October 2010,"From director David Slade (30 Days of Night), I had heard a few people say that this was a really good film despite the two stars that the critics give it, so I had to see which of the two opinions was right. Basically thirty two year old photographer Jeff Kohlver (Patrick Wilson) and fourteen year old Hayley Stark (Juno's Ellen Page) arrange a meeting in the Nighthawks coffee shop after chatting online for three weeks. In spite of the large age difference, Hayley is quite flirty with Jeff, and proposes that they should go back to his house. They carry on chatting a little more, while she prepares a screwdriver cocktail, and drinking this turns out to be a big mistake as her true intentions slowly come out. When Jeff wakes, Hayley has tied him to a chair, she is accusing him on being a paedophile seeing how all his photographs are of young girls, certainly mostly under the age of consent, and she knows one of the girls he worked with in particular. Apparently the girl he accuses of raping was found raped and murdered, she obviously wants him to confess that he was the one responsible, which he pleads he is not. As Hayley demands his confession, she starts very lightly, but soon enough much more savagely torturing him, mainly because of his attack on her as he tried to escape. The big torture is when he wakes up again to find a bag of ice on his testicles, and she is dressed in a doctor surgeon get-up threatening to cut his balls out, i.e. castrate him. She makes him believe that she did it, and he is sobbing when he realises she was tricking him, and he tries to escape again. Towards the end, Hayley is almost caught out by neighbour Judy Tokuda (Sandra Oh), and Jeff agrees to hang himself when his wife has come home, with Hayley promising to get rid of any evidence convicting him of paedophilia, once he drops though, she says ""or not..."". Normally you would have the format where the older character is torturing the younger character, this is quite a good spin, and Page makes a very mature performance, the off-screen violence, apart from the fake castration, isn't much, but it's not a bad psychological thriller. Okay!",Hard Candy
9,rmax304823,"First fifteen minutes, yeah! Then a nosedive into torture.",2,5 November 2007,"Patrick Wilson plays a 32-year-old professional photographer who we first see flirting with a 14-year-old girl, Ellen Page, on the internet. They meet at a cafe and, after he takes her on a little shopping trip, she more or less eagerly agrees to go to his apartment. So far, so good.The movie could easily have been procrustianized into another movie-of-the-week about a depraved Humbert Humbert salivating over an innocent, weeping, victimized young virgin. But it doesn't seem that way at all. It heads in a more adult direction. Wilson doesn't have long, greasy hair and jailhouse tattoos. He doesn't brag or try to con her in any way. He seems like a nice guy, with his professorial specs and his bland handsomeness and his apparently genuine reticence about taking a pubescent girl to his flat.And Ellen Page is like, wow, a bit dazzled by the attentions of this grown-up boy but, wow, she's like pretty forthcoming in every respect. ""Don't peek now,"" she says upon entering the dressing room to try on his gift. ""You're not mature enough,"" he says, grinning, not trying to peek. And then she opens the door and appears topless except for her bustier, her rock-hard abs rippling, and asks, ""Is this mature enough for you?"" In his apartment this same banter goes on. She makes jokes about the photos of young girls that adorn his walls and his explanation is both serious and understandable. If his photos are good it's because the models are good. The photographer is just the vehicle. At least one of them has gone on to the Ford agency. He's slept with none of them but has been in love with one, when he himself was younger. He has a closet full of pictures of nature for the World Wildlife Federation or something too.By this time it's clear that this isn't likely to turn into a depraved monster flick. The guy may be suffering from Lewis Carroll syndrome but he's fundamentally okay. The girl is quick-witted and perceptive, attracted and perhaps flattered but not discomfited by Wilson.So -- is something good in the offing? Will we learn something about why normal young men are attracted to teen-aged girls? Will we get some feeling for why adolescent girls develop crushes on mature men? No. We will not.Page mixes some screwdrivers and knocks Wilson out with one of those ""drugs"" that only exist in the movies, the effects of which are almost immediate and which last only long enough for the victim to be tied up helplessly. The young girl taunts him, pierces his ploys with ease, accuses him of being, oh, just about everything in the book, including a murderer, though he's guilty of nothing more than bad judgment. Not hideous judgment. Just bad judgment. Then she does to him what I once helped a group of Samoan villagers do to some male pigs. The movie shows this surgical procedure as simple, and it must be if it can be performed with a razor blade by a heavy handed farmer clad in a loincloth, although I must say the pigs objected like nobody's business, much more than Wilson does.The plot, such as it is, isn't worth describing in any more detail. Torture is torture. I was as disgusted by what happens to Wilson as I am by what happens to innocent young women in slasher movies.Who gets a kick out of such ineffable trash? Towards the end there is some mumbled business about Wilson having been involved in the murder of a young girl. Are we then supposed to be rooting for Ellen Page as an avenger? It's a bit hard to do that because until the end she had no more than a crazy suspicion that Wilson might have committed such a heinous act. I don't think we're supposed to feel sorry for Wilson either because the first time we meet him he's trading innuendos with some girl-child. What's more, he's got a stash of some unspecified photos of naked girls that Page discovers while rifling his apartment. Even without the evidence, we suspect him of harboring indecent thoughts about teen-aged girls. Is THAT enough reason to emasculate and kill him? If so, a lot of men are in trouble. And so are women. Being punished for thinking bad thoughts is the business of the Thought Police.I suspect the audience this is intended for is the same audience that claps and cheers as slaughters, each grislier than the last, follow one another in climactic order in a typical slasher movie. What a strange and pitiless people, who can applaud when an innocent is dismembered and yet wants to kill a man who has had offensive sexual impulses that he manages to control.",Hard Candy
10,Tweekums,You'll either love it or hate it... I loved it,10,4 January 2008,"I'd heard this film being strongly recommended by Mark Kermode in his Radio Five film reviews so thought I'd give it a go on DVD even though it sounded somewhat gruelling.I'm glad that I did watch it as it was excellent. It was different from most films that I've seen in that it is basically two people in a house talking to each other with moments of action and one scene that will have male viewers crossing their legs.------------ Spoilers ------------ The film opens with two people flirting on line and arranging to meet up, one is a thirty something man (Patrick Wilson) the other is a fourteen year old girl (Ellen Page).Soon they are on their way to his place and it looks as if she could be in danger, but soon it is clear that he is the one who needs to worry after she spikes his drink, ties him up and starts quizzing him about the photographs he has. When she finds more pictures incriminating him in both possession of child-porn and the disappearance of another teen-aged girl she gets more drastic in what she does to him.---------- End Spoilers ---------- The acting was very good in difficult roles, I'm sure it is only a matter of time before Ellen Page picks up an Oscar if she continues to act as well as she did in this.While it is gruelling at times there is no real gore so people expecting a slasher film will be disappointed... since I'm not that keen on gore I liked it.(The DVD also contains an interesting little making-of documentary and two different commentary tracks, one with the actors and the other with the director and writer.)",Hard Candy
11,BA_Harrison,Suck it and see!,7,28 May 2007,"Jeff Kohlver (Patrick Wilson), a suave 32-year old photographer, arranges to meet Hayley (Ellen Page), an intelligent and pretty 14-year old, after chatting to her on an internet message board.Hayley, however, isn't quite as innocent as she at first appears: she is actually a cold-blooded vigilante out to bring justice to evil child-molesting perverts.Hard Candy is a powerful thriller which carefully and intelligently explores the delicate themes of paedophilia and vigilantism, whilst also delivering some excruciatingly unbearable scenes of tension and a few cheap thrills. With a cast of only five performers, director David Slade has successfully crafted a slick, suspense filled movie that suffers only from a slightly overlong running time and the fact that it asks the viewer to accept the unlikely possibility that such an incredibly articulate and intelligent psychotic 14-year-old might actually exist (in my experience, most teenagers would struggle to spell 'paedophile', let alone be able to track one down and outwit them at every turn).If you are able to accept this somewhat implausible premise, then Hard Candy should provide you with enough action, drama, horror, and food for thought to make it a worthwhile viewing experience. David Slade's skillful development of the story forces his audience to constantly re-evaluate how they feel about Jeff and Hayley (during the course of the film, we feel sympathy and hatred towards both characters) and leads Kohlver and Page give strong, gutsy and confident performances.With its controversial subject matter, this daring movie might not reach as wide an audience as it deserves, but if you're in the mood for a hard-edged and gritty film that doesn't pull its punches, then you could do worse than to give this one a go.",Hard Candy
12,moonspinner55,More movie-nausea from Lions Gate...,3,24 January 2007,"A handsome, wealthy photographer with a pervy interest in underage girls meets a precocious 14-year-old on the internet and invites her into his home; she turns out to be a freckle-faced hellion who turns the tables on her host, tying him to a chair and uncovering his dirty little secrets before his very eyes. Disarmingly well-acted but otherwise completely off-putting picture, mostly a two-character psychological study in power and manipulation, throws in some torture for good measure (practically a prerequisite for Lions Gate these days). The character motivations become increasingly unclear and unconvincing, leading to a ridiculous, woebegone finale. The filmmakers seem insistent upon teaching us all a nasty lesson in morality--yet they refuse to learn from themselves--making the overall feel of ""Hard Candy"" as unseemly as pedophilia itself. *1/2 from ****",Hard Candy

14,Quinoa1984,"clever...too clever by half a ball, I mean half a something...",6,3 December 2007,"Note- not that too many people will read this, but this comment has some spoilers. Viewer discretion is sort of advised, depending on spoiler-ability and what-not.Hard Candy was one of the most 'talked-about' indie features of 2006. I put that in semi-quotes because a movie like Hard Candy does deserve some conversation time. And oddly enough this doesn't mean it was completely widely raved-about by critics despite its many wins at film festivals. It's meant to split up the audience, which is a fair thing to point out considering, since it's about putting an audience through the visceral reaction the characters go through in the picture. Whether or not what's up on the screen ends up as contrived or just a wee bit disappointing will depend on how much one can actually connect with the characters and this little 'game' that Hayley (cute and powerful Ellen Page) puts might-be pedophile Jeff (Patrick Wilson, also in the much richer drama-featuring-pedophilia Little Children) through the wringer. For all that goes arguably right and arguably wrong with the film, it's worth seeing once.The problem is, from my point of view, as the director David Slade and his write Brian Nelson jump off from precocious small-talk that's fine and witty (if somewhat obvious- ""Well, 4 out of 5 doctors agree that I am actually insane,"" says Hayley sort of ironically, though not at all mayhap), into a long-form version of the Stuck in the Middle With You sequence from Reservoir Dogs- only here substituting crazy Mr. Blonde and the embodiment of all cops Marvin Nash and some fun ear slicing with an oft continuously talkative and subtly crazy-eyed Hayley with the would-be embodiment of perverts in Jeff. Doesn't work as it should, even with the feeling of 'in-the-moment' being the same, which is heart-pounding tension. But the director and writer try to have their cake and eat it too by making big statements about the morality of luring girls from the internet into the homes of strange men, AND make an exploitation flick with some art-film pretensions (as good as Slade is, and he is good, at experimenting with color schemes and an unwavering close-up lens, he shouldn't go for the big shaky-cam scenes like he would later do to somewhat better effect in 30 Days of Night).Basically, and call me what you will for even thinking this, but the filmmakers didn't go enough, and it's the problem of having a scenario that ends up unraveling as that, an elaborate game that is not even so much played on by one character over another, but on the audience. As gruesome as it is, you expect that Jeff WILL be castrated by the blindly vengeful Hayley as a ""preventive measure"", and as terrible as it is- even off camera- you expect things to probably get uglier WITH this intact. But luckily, he keeps his assets, and the game continues, leading up to the stupid chase up to the roof and final proposal. Why not go all out? Why dangle a perfectly juicy carrot and fling it away at the convenience of the script or good taste or whatever? In a strange way Hard Candy starts to turn more exploitive, because it turns away from any questions raised about the vulnerability of youth or the sadism that lies in those who want to get some odd pleasure out of pain from others (just look at Abu-Gharib for that), and it becomes safer, more obvious, with the scripts layers revealing itself as just a pot-boiler in the guise of theater. Slade has the gifts to make it work, but he can't rise it quite to the level that it could be.And yet, this all said, it provoked enough of an emotional response that I can get where both sides are coming from- those who loved the tense unconventional idea of the roles reversed in a common criminal story that's almost become too common as of late (NBC's ""To Catch a Predator"" is one of the funniest, if most repetitive, TV shows as of late date), and those that hated that it went with no real message at the end thanks to muddled ambiguity. And do see it for the acting, as Page and Wilson do their best to look as cruel and frightened and provoked and unpredictable as possible under the circumstances; Page, especially, tries and succeeds in filling the shoes of a smarter-than-the-average 14 year old who's probably very clever- too clever by half even for the audience- in her plot. You know what she might do next, but you don't know quite how she'll react at the same time, which is something.",Hard Candy
15,Coventry,"Candy, Candy , Candy I can't let you go!",6,20 January 2007,"Okay, pedophilia isn't a very pleasant topic but we sadly can't ignore it any longer in these sick times we live in, and personally I think it still took quite a long time before some ambitious nowadays author had the nerves to revolve a whole script on this sensitive and controversial subject. Particularly the first half of ""Hard Candy"" is deeply impressive, since the characters  especially Jeff, the pedophile  are so randomly normal looking, which makes the secret lives they're living all the more disturbing. The opening sequence, displaying an online conversation resulting in a meeting appointment of the two chatters, initially seems so recognizable and harmless until we get to see their faces at the meeting point, and then it's just so...wrong! Hayley is an intellectually precocious 14-year-old girl, apparently lured to the secluded house of a kind and understanding 32-year-old photographer. His intentions are sick and perverted, naturally, and Jeff quickly tries to get Hayley drunk and out of her tiny outfit. Yet, this isn't the start of another tragic story about a physically abused teenager, as suddenly HE gets drugged and tied up in a chair. Hayley selected Jeff off the internet to ruin his entire existence and not vice versa. In her very own private trial against pedophilia, she herself will be the judge, the jury and the executioner and she'll stand up for all the young & innocent victims Jeff ever laid eyes on. As said, the first half of ""Hard Candy"" is magnificently intense shock-cinema. Hayley's plan is extremely dangerous and against all laws, but her actions are heroic and her speeches are indelible: people like Jeff are sick criminals! Their actions aren't justifiable and they must all be castrated! It's highly praiseworthy how director David Slade and writer Brian Nelson don't use this socially fragile topic to raise moral debates or fake sentiment. The opinion towards child molesters are unanimous. They must be punished and referring to their sexual cravings as a disease simply isn't an option! Unfortunately enough, the script loses quite a lot of its impact after a while. Partly because the cast of two characters is just a little too limited and 45 talkative minutes just passed by without a single moment of action, but mainly because the implausibility takes the upper hand. Exactly how intelligent can a teenage girl be? How is it possible that she planned every little detail step by step? How improbable is it that she wins every psychological cat & mouse game? And  most of all  how does a skinny little thing like herself manages to lift a unconscious adult up on a kitchen table? For thrillers and controversial dramas, it's ultimately the last couple of plot-twists and denouements that are essential. ""Hard Candy"" sadly does not have the power to haunt your thoughts long after the movie finished. The concept is dared and moving, the photography is often stunning and the acting performances of both Ellen Page and Patrick Wilson are downright staggering, but still I can't label it as a masterpiece.",Hard Candy

To give director David Slade his due he's resisted smart ass camera trickery to disguise this but by the same token the film can't escape the feeling it might have been sourced as a theatre play and belongs in an entirely different medium The second thing is fourteen year old Hayley never speaks as you suspect a fourteen year old schoolgirl does . Now I've no idea what fourteen year olds talk like in real life but I'd hazard a guess it is nothing like this line: "" I mean, you're the grown up here. If a kid is experimenting and says something flirtatious, you ignore it, you don't encourage it! If a kid says 'Hey, let's make screwdrivers!' You take the alcohol away, and you don't race them to the next drink!"" Hmmm . Sounds less like spontaneous teen speak and more like considered dialogue from an adult screenwriter . I also noticed a reference to Roman Polanski and has the average fourteen year old any knowledge of Polanski ? This is a pity because you instantly know that this isn't exploitation cinema and creates a web of moral ambiguous questions which no doubt the audience are left to make up their own minds on which does allow a degree of respect for said audience . For this HARD CANDY deserves credit but it remains a bit too heavy handed to be taken entirely seriously and doesn't make for an entirely successful film",Hard Candy
18,Scarecrow-88,Hard Candy,8,29 September 2006,"No mistake about it, this film is a daring one to make. We essentially see this 13 year old girl, howbeit a bright, ""smart way beyond her years"" drug and torture a 33 year old pedophile for an hour and a half or so. This film cleverly dares to show this girl actually out-dueling, psychologically, a man who has wooed quite a few teenagers.To have an entire film set in one general location for most of the way and have these two hold our interest is an amazing feat. This film has something to say and is clearly an indictment on pedophilia and it's damages. For a film to turn the tables in another direction where the predator becomes the prey is quite a challenge. I think this film succeeds.Casting is certainly key. Patrick Wilson really is a perfect choice for the role of Jeff, the photographer who can flash his profession in the face of pretty young things with the throwaway exuberance of those ""possible future models"" expected. Patrick's frat-boy looks and calm reserve really fit right for this pedophile. He looks like a perfectly normal man who we'd have a hard time believing could be such a monster when all to his lonesome gazing at a computer screen probing away on the internet superhighway for that chance to get that young virginal lay.But, Ellen Page is the revelation here. She absolutely dominates the screen with this allure director David Slade visually captures with his camera. You instantly believe her as ""Hayley"" and her transformation from what Jeff believes she is to who she REALLY is, this is startling to behold. She is able to toy with him and see through him. Understanding who Jeff really is through carefully studied research makes this film quite fascinating as it develops. She knows all his secrets and he is ultimately at her mercy.What TRULY motivates Hayley's vengeance, and how does it involve a missing girl and Jeff's former lover? These questions are answered and we see who Jeff really is after Hayley gets done with him.",Hard Candy
19,preppy-3,Disturbing but a must-see,10,7 May 2006,"A guy in his thirties Jeff (Patrick Wilson) meets teenage Hayley (Ellen Page) online. They agree to meet. They get along and she goes to his house with him. Then she drugs his drink. He wakes up tied to a chair and Hayley calling him a pedophile and prepared to teach him a lesson. But is he? Basically just a 2 person movie and mostly all talk but absolutely fascinating. The will of wits between the two characters is just stunning and has you questioning if Hayley is right or if Jeff is innocent. It's incredible how the movie has you feeling pity for BOTH of the characters at different times. You're never sure who's right and how it will end up.The acting is superb. I must say Patrick Wilson shocked me. I saw him in ""Angels in America"" and ""Phantom of the Opera"". I thought he was a very handsome man but a bland actor. This movie changed all that. He's just brilliant! The agony and terror his character goes through seems all too real. This part demands a LOT out of any actor and he pulls it off. Very brave. Page is downright terrifying. Her character is (obviously) unstable and you're never sure what she'll do next. Again...a very difficult role but she pulls it off. Also the direction is great. Everything is done in closeups of the actors faces. At first it annoyed me--then I realized it works in the movies favor giving it a very claustrophobic, uneasy feeling.This is not for everybody. It's grim and explicit (in terms of dialogue) and I'm sure there are moments which might have some guys bolting for the exits. I found it unsettling and fascinating. If you can handle the subject matter I strongly recommend this. A 10.",Hard Candy

Just when the noose is ready to be tightened, the prey becomes the predator and we are exposed to a taut, suspenseful film with an amazing new actress.

Newcomer director David Slade and novice screenwriter Brian Nelson rack up the tension in this chatty and sharp display of predator versus prey and vice versea with taut editing and clammy suspense for the most part until the last act feels played out as far as one can endure.

So, taking a step back from the nuts and bolts of film-making, and looking at the film on a more abstract level, I am left somewhat unsettled.To be fair, that may have been the filmmakers' intention.Let's shift down a gear and look at the nuts and bolts.This psychological thriller (but who's the psycho?) rattles along at a decent lick, generating a fair amount of tension as it goes. Given that it's essentially a two-hander in a single claustrophobic location, there are more than enough twists and turns to satisfy.Patrick Wilson does well, generating sympathy in a relatively unsympathetic part, and realistically evoking the terror which anyone watching will empathise with.But it's Ellen Page's film, and provides solid early evidence that this young woman is going to be a major screen presence in the years to come.",Hard Candy
23,ferguson-6,"""Don't"" use that word",6,7 May 2006,"Greetings again from the darkness. Not your typical psychological thriller as we are yanked into the world of online predators and pedophilia. Music video director David Spade has some nice moments and has a pretty tough assignment with the limited space and, of course, the subject matter.What makes the film work at all is the first half hour and the tremendous acting of Patrick Wilson (best known as William Travis in ""The Alamo"" and Raoul in ""Phantom of the Opera"") and especially Ellen Page (who is 19 in real life) as the 14 yr old who grabs Wilson's character where it counts.The first half hour set-up makes for some very uncomfortable moments and sets our minds racing as to how this will play out. There is very little doubt that our Lolita/Halley is more than she seems. During this time, Wilson does a nice job of injecting just enough doubt about doubt about how far he would actually go. We know the guy is a sleaze, but he does manage to draw some sympathy.The movie begins to unravel when Halley's plan comes full force. The script suffers and naturally, so do the actors. While the table was set for a nice little thriller, it turns into an outlandish, over the top psychological case study and it never recovers. The film has a bit of the feel of ""One Hour Photo"" but is not in that class.Director Slade may have something and we should find out soon as he is involved with ""30 Days of Night"" due out later this year.",Hard Candy

For the most part this film s pretty involving and intriguing. There are a few instances where it does get a bit far-fetched, however I feel that the movie was good enough that I can forgive it for it's lapses in judgment. It's also well acted and kept my interests throughout. On a side-note, I keep hearing those that view Haley as being a monster of some kind, this of course is preposterous thinking and stems from the VERY liberal theory that child molesters can be redeemed or rehabilitated in any way, shape, or form. Of course that is a load of BS and if you feel that way perhaps this is not a film for you. Go watch the ""Jeepers Creepers"" films instead and support a real life pedophile.

25,gradyharp,"A Tightly Written, Directed and Acted Controversial Thriller",10,20 September 2006,"HARD CANDY is one of those films that took enormous courage on the part of the writer (Brian Nelson), director (David Slade), and producers - let alone the actors - to bring a tale of pedophilia to the mainstream audience. Made for a small budget (yet the production values are so very artistic that it feels like an expensive film), HARD CANDY is essentially a duet for two actors: the actors Ellen Page and Patrick Wilson deliver performances that become indelibly burned on the mind of the viewer.32-year old photographer Jeff has been chatting online with 14-year old Haley for three weeks using standard chat room seduction lines. They meet, talk, seem to get along well - until Haley invites herself to Jeff's home, much against Jeff's better judgment. Once home the beautiful space in which Jeff lives (the set decor is splendid, using sensitive colors in a cinematic way), the walls adorned with photographs of young models, seems a fitting space for a fine photographer. But soon the twist of the story explodes and Haley lets Jeff know that she is there to punish him for his pedophilia and for some specific events in his history. She drugs him, and when he awakens Jeff is the captive, forced to undergo the intensive questioning and innuendos from Haley, including being set up for castration. The tension mounts to a peak as the two characters uncover aspects of each other; the final resolution of the long encounter comes as a stunning surprise.The quality of the film is so fine that no judgments are made: is Jeff truly a criminal pedophile?, is Haley insane?, can this reversal of roles happen? The script is so beautifully written that it remains intelligent and straight, forcing the viewer to become involved in the quest for truth. Ellen Page delivers a brilliant performance as Haley and Patrick Wilson steps out of his usual milk toast roles to create a man driven by strange needs who gradually comes to a point of self acceptance in one of the more powerful scenes of film this viewer has seen.The audience for this examination of pedophilia may be small and therein lies the pity. This is a film that deals with a tough subject so very well that the viewer gains an understanding into dysfunctional characteristics while being caught up in a suspenseful thriller of a story. This is independent film making at its best.",Hard Candy
26,The_Void,Gritty and traumatic; one of the best films in years!,7,4 October 2006,"Hard Candy takes an idea that has become the subject of a million warnings since the introduction of the internet, and turns it on its head. The film is extremely brave in the way that the subject matter is handled, and it constantly tackles unpleasant themes head on. I really don't associate this type of film with modern cinema, and so Hard Candy deserves high praise for daring to go where so many films these days dare not. Unfortunately, the story doesn't quite come together as well as it could have done, but it is difficult to juggle so many themes and what we do have here is a tense and traumatic film that brilliantly gets the audience into the heads of both of the main characters. The film begins by showing an internet conversation in which two people - a teenage girl and an older man - agree to meet in a café. The girl comes on strong, and she ends up inviting herself back to the man's apartment after he tells her that he has an mp3 from a Goldfrapp concert. However, the girl has an ulterior motive, and pretty soon their traditional roles are reversed as she takes control of the situation.The way that director David Slade builds tension is extremely impressive, and the central set-piece is likely to result in a lot of chewed fingernails and ground down teeth in audience members. The focus on the characters and their actions become rather skewed during this period and I actually found myself feeling sorry for the paedophile. This may well be the point of the film, however; as several things are left wide open, leaving the audience members to make their mind up about which actions are right, and Hard Candy definitely succeeds in making its audience members think. Of course, it would be practically impossible for the director to put a slant on the film that would completely satisfy everyone, but what we do have here is a film that makes a point in a way that is a lot more poignant than many more critically acclaimed films. As a thriller, the film works extremely well also; as mentioned, Hard Candy is extremely gripping at its best moments, and I don't think I've completely 'gotten into' a modern film this much for some time. I can't say this film is for everyone; but Hard Candy is very nearly a complete success, and I recommend everyone at least give it a go.",Hard Candy
27,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Hard Candy,8,30 July 2006,"Hard candy is an internet slang for an under-aged girl. And this actually reminded me of a social experiment that a friend and I conducted in the internet chat rooms some 5 years back. There were always plenty of talk and reports about how dangerous the Internet is, with the chatrooms being a gold mine for pedophiles chatting up little girls, and then doing dastardly deeds with them when they're enticed to meet up in real life.So we decided to check it out ourselves. My friend and I posed as ""sweetgal18"" and entered a local popular chatroom. Even before you can say Hello, pop ups after pop ups of private messages come flooding the screen, some started innocently, others were more direct, asking for sexual favors. In this experiment however, we stopped short of arranging to meet these people, and turn up just to take their photos from afar and put it online. However, I recall of late some local blogsite actually started a crusade against these perverts, and went the extra mile which we couldn't. Bravo!Now back to the movie. With a cast of essential 2 leads + 3 extras with extremely limited screen time, the story and dialog pieces had to be extremely engaging to hold the audience's attention. And that was successfully done. It begins with a sexually charged tease over a chatroom conversation between Jeff Kohlver (Patrick Wilson), a 32 year old photographer, and Hayley Stark (Ellen Page), a 14 year old student whose level of maturity surpasses her age.They decide to meet up, and we play witness to a seemingly innocent face to face introduction, before things start to become a little loaded with double entrees, and dialogs laced with innuendoes. Before long, Hayley decides to follow Jeff home, and there's where the ""fun"" begins, where little red riding hood goes up against a probably ""coloured wolf"".It's in the same vein as Saw, except that the explicit violence is exchanged for psychological warfare, and throughout the entire movie, you're constantly wondering and changing positions of thought, as to who's possibly right, or wrong, doing the right thing (vigilantism?) - who's actions can be justified, or should you pity the victim caught in a tables about turned situation? You'll be second guessing a lot, as the psychological play gets stepped up and you wonder just who should you thrown your support to - could Hayley just be a crazed kid, and could Jeff possibly be maligned and actually is a harmless soul? The characters straddle both ends of the good-evil spectrum, until certain hints start to prod you in the right direction.But as psychological play is concerned, this means plenty of dialog, and thankfully the leads were credible in their delivery. However, it also means that not much happens, until the frantically paced set action pieces that never relents up till the end. There is however one major scene which will definitely make you squirm. I know I did, and my stomach actually churned, even without having the scene explicitly played out on screen as punishment is dished.All's revealed at the finale, and despite so much drama-mama, it'll actually make you smile with (sick) satisfaction about the grandeur plot, which to some, is a loophole akin to a typical Bond villain's monologue.The movie serves as a timely reminder for anyone with children or young siblings, to warn them of the clear and present dangers of the dark side of the internet, that they should reveal any personal information about their personal lives, or in the first place, not to chat with strangers. On the net, everyone can be anyone. Then again, strangers should not talk to seemingly innocent children, lest they really turn out to be psychopaths. I wish these perverts ill fortune that something of his nature will befall them, and that they get their just desserts.I smell a possible franchise that could happen.",Hard Candy

29,siderite,"Interesting idea, although not completely original, goes sour",6,2 October 2006,"The thing with this movie is that it tries to do a role reversal with the underage girl being the perpetrator. But it goes soft really quick. She looks tough, but she's not. The guy has like three attempts to escape and he does the most stupid choices. The end is completely unbelievable.But what I thought sucked in this movie most is that it has the same recipe as House of Sand: Six characters in all, so you think it's a filmed play, extreme psychological tension that reveals something in the end, etc. And it has the same bloody effect: you identify with the victim and empathize with it and the whole message of the movie (if it ever was one) is lost completely. In this case, I've never been more sympathetic to a pedophile in my life.In conclusion: it might have shown 40 minutes of psychological torture so that we feel the exact same feelings of sympathy for the victim and expectation for it to escape, then announce it was a hidden camera show or something. It would have had the exact same effect and it would have taken 10 times less money and wasted half only the time.",Hard Candy
30,StevePulaski,"Hard to swallow, but great filmmaking is the filling",9,4 September 2013,"Hard Candy has the impact to be one of the most disturbing pictures a person has ever seen. The strange thing about that is that the film is not graphic, there's no sexual content whatsoever, and there are far, far more violent and vulgar films out there to scar curious viewers. What makes Hard Candy such a pulsating, disturbing movie experience? Writer Brian Nelson and director David Slade craft the film aesthetically off of tense situations and unsettling camera-angles, along with very strong, verbose dialog that will make you a restless viewer. The result is an experience that possesses a Hitchockian effect - fear what's coming; what's not yet arrived.The film has two characters, a rather short runtime, and two settings and manages to be more fascinating than your average dozen-person, two and a half hour long thriller. Ellen Page plays fourteen year old Haley, a girl who frequents chatrooms to talk to Jeff, an older male in his early-thirties. The film opens with a quickly-paced online discussion between the two in a chatroom which leads to a meeting at a local cafe. They talk for a while; she is clearly interested, he is, maybe, subtly aroused, and they head back to his home for screwdrivers and some private fun.She winds up spiking his drink and he wakes up tied to a computer chair. She claims to know he is a pedophile and has a record of mistreating and manipulating young girls. Her goal is to put him through the same physical and mental pain he allegedly brought on many girls right around her own age. If he screams, she resorts to spraying his mouth with some sort of clear liquid (perhaps cleaning solution), and if he tries to escape, he will be met with blunt force. However, this is a shockingly brutal movie solely because of the conversations Haley and Jeff have with each other in Jeff's home, which looks nothing like the archetypal home of a eerie man. No obsessive pictures plastered on walls, no dimly lit, brick fortress providing little light, and no cheap tube TV with a couch sitting in the glow of it. Just an avid, middle class man's home.The commonality gives off the idea that perhaps Jeff is really a normal guy, however, Haley's got almost indisputable evidence against this notion. So onward we watch, as Haley continues to torture and manipulate Jeff, and we, as the viewer, begin to experience odd tendencies ourselves. I can see viewers finding a serious conflict on who to side with in the film. Should we side with Haley because she is theoretically torturing a man who is inhumane and truly perverted, or should we condemn her because two wrongs don't make a right. I'm likely not alone in saying I had serious sympathy for Jeff's character during some parts of the film. My feelings of sympathy were quickly followed by feelings of personal loathing, questioning why I had sympathy for such a person. Such feelings repeated until the film was over and casually poked at me throughout the rest of the day.Because of this reason, many will find the film to be of low quality or mistake its shocking aspects as a point of criticism. On the contrary, if a film can get under your skin the way a film like Hard Candy can - through almost intrusive ways - something must be said about the quality of its material. Material that is only elevated by such great leads as Page and Wilson, who bring new dimensions to the teenage girl and the creepy thirty-year old. Page knows how to make manipulative and dictative something to root for, while Wilson's seemingly despicable character be made into a slightly-sympathetic one is equal parts offputting as it is true acting talent. To humanize and paint a sympathetic portrait of such a heartless, irredeemable stereotype is the biggest achievement of his acting career thus far.Director Slade, as mentioned, makes Hard Candy very heavy in the stylistic-camera-work department, particularly utilizing closeups and very distinct camera-positions to either heighten vulnerability or power in a character. It's filmmaking 101, but here, the bare-basics feel fresh and subversive due to the fact that they are used to accentuate their purpose to the fullest effect. Rarely have the elements of filmmaking and film shots been so purposeful this early on in the film. Slade, combined with writer Nelson's effective slowburn techniques, make Hard Candy nothing but memorable.Year after year, American audiences see many horror films, many of them featuring women being brutalized, victimized, and murdered. This is not to pull up a sexist debate, but just to pull up a fact in the face of horror cinema. Along comes this film where the roles are reversed, and the film still packs in a wallop of significant proportions. Hard Candy is one of those rare cinematic endeavors where nearly everything it tries to do works, and what little doesn't work for it (IE: the expected escape attempt at the end) is almost as quickly forgotten as it is introduced.Starring: Ellen Page and Patrick Wilson. Directed by: David Slade.",Hard Candy
31,Smells_Like_Cheese,Who is the bigger villain?,9,1 March 2007,"My friend just showed me Hard Candy, I was really looking forward to this movie because I saw that it was nominated for a few awards on the FUSE channel, or something like that for horror movies. She said this is one of those movies that will leave you puzzled at the end and I have to say that I was speechless after finishing it. It was so interesting because like the movie ""Clockwork Orange"", the director in some sick way makes you feel sorry for a second for a deranged man who is a pedophile and a murderer. I never really did like those type of movies, but for some odd reason I liked this one.Haylie is a 13 year old girl who meets a charming 32 year old man off the internet, he claims to be a photographer and shoots young aspiring models who are in their teens. He takes her to his apartment, let's her make sexual flirts with him, let's her drink alcohol, and let's her start to do a strip tease, little does he know the joke is on him when he passes out and wakes up to being tied in a chair and has been drugged by Haylie. She won't let him go until he has learned his lesson... or will she? The ""operation"" scene was one of the most disturbing scenes I have ever witnessed, it was so crazy and insane. But I really loved how intelligent Haylie was, I know that this sounds crazy but she did everything that every pedophile should go through, probably worse. Even though it seems like he should in some sick way get sympathy, you still want Haylie to get the message through to him.

33,thesar-2,"Snip, Snip",8,13 June 2009,"Obviously, since I'm a male, a good portion of this film was, well, ""hard"" to watch. But overall, 'Hard Candy' was excellently paced, suspenseful and extremely clever in asking questions/opening doors and leaving the viewer's mind reeling during the last frame. Of course, all the way through this, I kept thinking back to one of my all time favorite films, a ten-year older 'Death and the Maiden,' which used the same concept, but updated it, brought it home to America and had less squirminess for males. Courting online, Hayley agrees to meet overly horny Jeff unbeknownst to us (until the actually meet in the stereotypical coffee house) that he's much older and she's far too young (14.) She flirts her way back to his home, into his liquor and finally drugs and ties him up for reasons the movie unravels. Page as Hayley really holds her own, while Wilson, as her captive, also does a somewhat good job. And they both should; all but 5 minutes, it's just them holding every scene of the film. Who is she? What connection does she have to the alleged victims of Jeff, an accused pedophile? Is he really guilty? Is she really nuts or justified? I loved the questions this movie proposes, and the questions we ask ourselves: if a loved one was a victim of a sick individual, would we do the same? And long after the ""gimmick"" scene the creators/cast keep referring to (as I did previously in this review – something ""hard"" to watch,) we still watch on how this will play out. Despite the subject matter, and time it takes to get to the revealing conclusions (at least some of them,) I really enjoyed this film and found another gem (along with 'Juno') that shows true depth to Page.",Hard Candy
34,bowmanblue,Candy crush,8,20 October 2014,"'Hard Candy' is a kind of 'cat and mouse' tale in the most traditional of ways. You may think that a story about – effectively – a young, skinny fourteen-year-old girl versus a fully-grown healthy man might be a little one-sided. However, you obviously haven't seen how Ellen Page plays it.A successful photographer (Patrick Wilson) has a weakness for chatting up underage girls over the internet. Yet he gets more than he bargained for when he finally gets round to meeting Ellen Page's character, 'Hayley,' For she takes it upon herself to perform a little adolescent vigilante justice upon him.Like I said... you may think that there's not an awful lot a teenager can do to a man. But then if I told you the specifics of what transpires, I'd be spoiling it for you. All I'll say is that the balance of power shifts and then shifts again between the two as their own private little war ensues.There's really only the two characters in the film, therefore it's up to Page and Wilson to shoulder the film's burden. And they do it pretty well. Both characters are a pair of sad and damaged individuals and one of the film's many strengths is that it makes it hard for the audience to tell who's the guilty party – if there is one at all.It's not an easy watch. You have to be ready for a pretty dark and bleak drama with some really nasty moments. One thing's for sure... this ain't no 'Little Red Riding Hood' tale.",Hard Candy

But there are a few films I wish I'd rather not have watched. This is one of them. The film gets under your skin to the point where it becomes uncomfortable (if not unbearable) to watch. The film is carried by two characters only, played by Patrick Wilson and Ellen Page, and they do it exceptionally well - especially Ellen Page. This was a very different set-up where the pedophile becomes the victim. It was even more tense than a gory horror film.",Hard Candy
36,TheMovieDiorama,Hard Candy crunches down on sweet castration but isn't exactly hard to watch.,6,26 September 2018,"For some reason unbeknown to me, I like uncomfortable thrillers. Those select few films that make your skin crawl, either due to excessive scenes of torture or the disturbed nature of its story. Hard Candy is comprised of the two, but never truly thoroughly explores either one. A 14-year old girl is seemingly groomed by an older man who she agrees to meet in real life, only for the revelatory outcome that she is a vigilante suspecting him of being a sexual predator. Naturally she traps, drugs and tortures him. Now this is a rather unconventional film, flipping the typical sexual predation premise on its head. For the most part, it works. A ridiculously strong performance from Page shows her ruthlessness with a few strands of insanity. Wilson also delivers with a peculiarly captivating performance, especially when he screams in fear. Considering the film primarily comprises of these two actors, they worked well together. The narrative starts exceedingly well, particularly at making you feel uncomfortable. Wilson wiping chocolate ganache from innocent Page's lips surprisingly sent shivers down my spine. Slade's directing style, whilst occasionally erratic, ensured that the focus was on these two characters by having the camera constantly pointing at them. Whether he be panning around the room or solely utilising a long take to allow the character's anguish to convey onscreen, it always felt minimalistic yet powerful. The usage of red and white was also noteworthy, perhaps symbolising the blend of innocence and guilt. The screenplay is quick into making you assume the worst is going to happen to the girl, however there are certain traits that alleviate this presumption. Her intrusive nature, particularly forcing him to invite her round his house, and innocent demeanour somewhat put him in a predicament. Alas, the film is right to point out that ""you ignore it, you don't encourage it!"". It even attempts to paint a bigger picture of pedophilia by mentioning Polanski and how his career has not been hindered.Brave, but not nearly as effective as it should've been. And that is one of my main issues with the film. It almost seems disposable and derivative, to which I do believe it could've tackled the overall theme more efficiently. The psychological torture felt unnecessary, considering she simply wanted a confession. The plan to invite his love round could've been executed immediately and the same results would've applied, therefore consequently diminishing the thrills that preceded the concluding act. The castration, asphyxiation and other methods of torture now feels like it was just implemented to fill up the runtime. Her motivation into vigilantism isn't explored and feels redundant, disabling any emotional investment towards her. In fact, the narrative surprisingly resonates sympathetic emotions towards him, despite acknowledging his guilt. And that's because his character has more backstory than hers. I just...found this film to be bizarre. It's not explicit enough with its content to be classed as a torture film, but it's not tense enough to be a thriller. Still, excellent central performances accompanied by minimalistic direction did make for a memorable, if confused, story. Ellen Page. Pedophile hunter extraordinaire.",Hard Candy
37,Tweetienator,Sweet Candy,7,22 May 2019,"What I like mostly of Hard Candy are the performances of the involved actors - Patrick Wilson and Ellen Page do great.
If you read some of the reviews you see that some love them and many don't - if the audience takes a movie very controversial this is in my view a sign to give that movie a try - if the story or genre is of any interest to me. All in all Hard Candy is no masterpiece but also no abomination, but a well crafted movie.",Hard Candy
38,insomniac_rod,Certainly the little red riding hood of the new millennium.,8,10 December 2010,"This is a perfectly acted movie. Ellen Page and Patrick Wilson deliver mature, believable, and terrifying (at some point) performances.Hayley is a sick and twisted young girl, totally lunatic. I mean, it doesn't matter how repugnant and gross Jeff is, simply, it's not justified the way he's tortured.As an audience, we don't have a chance except accepting Hayley's thirst for revenge. We can't feel symphaty for her. The Director David Slade wants the audience to generate an opinion towards pedophiles. Do pedos deserve to be tortured?Hayley's motivation gets confusing and not very clear... For that reason, the ending may totally be unexpected and will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth. It was a mistake to watch this movie on a Sunday afternoon! Me and my depressions. Anyway, the message of the movie, or it's intention, is to give us a brutal and violent lesson in moral. Yes, we're forced to learn the hard way that pedophilia and it's derivations are something bad. The main problem with the movie is that David Slade mixes the audiences that are able to understand and enjoy the movie. The dialogs are intense and always have a double intention. For example, Hayley says that ""4 out of 5 Doctors agree that she's a total freak"" or something like that. She says it in an ironic tone.That way, Slade wanted to mix an exploitation film with pseudo-artistic influences. This is nothing at all Art Cinema, nor Exploitation. This is just a raw attempt to express an opinion towards a hard topic such as pedophilia.Even though, Slade's artistic pretensions look realized through a dynamic direction, brilliant cinematography that mixes colors that can alter your senses. And my favorite, the violent close-ups in nerve tensing situations. I will give him the merit for creating a visually uncomfortable movie that is uncomfortable by nature.All the action takes place in just one scenario. It's like a theater play and that's why the game of the cat chasing the mouse gets very elaborated that it can become dull.But we're lucky and we have plenty of violence. It gets moral and physical. It's really brutal when Hayley ties his victim, blinds him, just as preventive measures, and then she prepares him for a castration. The ending is up to your criteria. I think it was interesting but almost incredible. I mean, incredible because it would be very difficult to happen in real life. Nah, didn't work for me. It's a matter of opinions.Is it that young people's vulnerability is just a myth? Sadism is also possible and the fact that a young woman enjoys torturing a man means that the plot focuses in sending it's message.We get gore, violence, foul language, and more. Definitely ranks as a very uncomfortable movie.The opinions towards pedophiles should be unanimous. I agree that they should be punished and judged according to criminal law. That a girl castrates a man shouldn't be an option!.Not a movie for everyone but still deserves a watch.",Hard Candy
39,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Impressively keeps its audience from being comfortable in every way,8,20 June 2011,"Some films challenge you down to the bones. The question comes to whether or not getting your insides churned to butter serves not merely as shock value, but comes with an apparent and insightful significance. ""Hard Candy"" might be more along the lines of 80 percent shock, existing to jar you in every way possible, but it's darn effective.The film opens with an instant messaging conversation between 14-year-old Hayley (Ellen Page) and 32-year-old Jeff (Patrick Wilson). They are clearly having an inappropriate conversation and agree to meet each other in person. Their ""date"" constitutes something bothersome but not entirely atrocious — yet. Jeff understands his boundaries, but it doesn't stop him from making certain comments or being vocal about when Hayley ""teases"" him. He's not a likable guy, but he clearly seems to have a grip on his ""issues."" Nevertheless, he brings her back to his house so she can borrow some music she wants. They make some cocktails and then suddenly Jeff falls unconscious. He wakes up to find himself tied to a chair.""Hard Candy"" is no revenge fantasy. You don't enjoy as Hayley turns the tables on Jeff. It's painful and at some obvious points, quite gruesome. Yet in Page's performance, you feel a twisted rage and a cold determination uncommon in a girl her age, but not entirely unbelievable.Her malicious ways, however, are not even the most challenging aspect of the film, but rather it's the way that Brian Nelson's story — amplified by the direction of David Slade and Patrick Wilson's vulnerable performance — makes us sympathize with a man who might well be guilty of the things his captor accuses him. A lack of proof as to whether Jeff is a bona fide pedophile curiously sways our view of who's right and who's wrong. In that sense, ""Hard Candy"" reveals more about its audience than either of its main characters.Much of the film is an agonizing experience for the viewer between actual torture and this holding of a mirror to the way we perceive sexual deviance. In Wilson's performance we see someone struggling psychologically and emotionally, but that does not make him a morally laudable character. In Page's performance we see a deeply troubled girl with iron-clad conviction, but that doesn't make her the hero of the story. The ambiguity here lends to the film's strengths while also compound the difficulty of the viewer to find a comfort zone for any length of time during the film.Slade appropriately paces this film as a thriller, lingering on tougher moments and effectively moving the camera exactly where it needs to go to magnify the effects the script intends. There are a lot of strange transition shots where the camera leaves the scene in one direction and comes back to it like a super-fast fade out and in. But like any good psychological thriller, his effects mimic those same processes that the brain does or might undergo being in the scenario of the film or being a viewer of it as we are.The culmination of an hour of difficult movie-watching isn't exactly perfect. The ending isn't entirely satisfying as mentally we must recalibrate our moral compasses yet again, but such should be the nature of a film so jarring: we should not leave with our views on this moral conundrum affirmed nor completely refuted. Essentially, ""Hard Candy"" achieves this brilliantly, leaving a haunting effect on the viewer that in and of itself warrants praise.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",Hard Candy
40,jzappa,Sometimes the Only Way to End a Cycle of Violence Is to Kill,9,29 November 2006,"Hard Candy is a tough movie to comment on without giving something away. It's a film that delivers each and every plot turn, even the smallest ones, with such intense shock to its audience that if you're watching it on DVD and you see someone banging on your window for help because wild predators are chasing them, you will quickly motion for them to wait until it's over. Better than most other thrillers that I've seen, it plays the audience like a piano and every single thing that you predict early on is not just contradicted, but both agreed and contradicted. As the film progresses, whenever you're put in a suspenseful situation, you wave your hand with a shrug and say, ""Jeez, I give up. I have no idea what's gonna happen.""Its plot is amongst the top form of comeuppance films, torture endurance test films, and battle of wits films. Its characters are so deeply and chillingly real and drawn masterfully by the writer and both leads.Like I said, it's very hard to elaborate on my praises, which I would love to do, but if I did, I would inevitably spoil at least a layer of the thrill one gets from watching such a tense and truly brilliant dramatic suspense-thriller, tightly wound and truly truly surprising. I know; when you read reviews and especially viewer comments from nonprofessional critics, the words ""brilliant,"" ""surprising,"" and ""unpredictable"" are simply thrown around whenever someone loves a movie and raves about it. Whether they have such a strong conviction that the film is indeed true to those particular descriptions or not is always left in the air until you see it for yourself, not having been properly encouraged or warned or convinced. That makes it tough for people when there comes a film like Hard Candy, when yes, I could work around using those three all-too-common words, but they just fit so well.",Hard Candy
41,Vartiainen,Perky sociopath hipster child,8,1 February 2017,"In her breakthrough role Ellen Page plays Hayley Stark, if that's even her real name, a 14-year-old girl who invites herself over to a grown man's home in order to expose him as a pedophile. She promptly drugs him and the rest of the film is pretty much her gleefully torturing him to get a confession.So, yeah...It's a dark movie. And I mean really dark. So dark in fact that it almost becomes hilarious. It certainly is so over the top in its portrayal of Hayley that you don't really even register the horrible things she does to this man. It's also a great movie in that you can't really tell whether she's right or not. Ellen Page plays her very unhinged, whereas Patrick Wilson as the suspected pedophile is very sympathetic and believable in his outcries of innocence. I shall not spoil which one of them is right, because it really is a great reveal near the end, but trust me when I say that the film keeps you guessing till the very end.The only real flaw of this film is that it's the directorial debut of its director David Slade and that certainly shows. The movement of the camera draws the eye a bit too much and most of the shots are too close to the faces of the actors. It makes it more intense and claustrophobic, certainly, but it also takes something away from the experience when you can count the nose hairs without much effort.Nevertheless, the story and the actors more than make up for it and it's a film unlike anything I've seen before. A simple plot in theory, but explored to the darkest depths.",Hard Candy
42,billcr12,Good not great,7,29 March 2012,"Ellen Page plays a 14 year old who meets a photographer online who is 32 and they meet at a cafe. He later takes her home and gives her drinks. Hayley(Page) mixes vodka and orange juice, telling the potential Romeo, Jeff that she will only drink what she has mixed. Now things get interesting. Lover boy wakes up tied to a chair and Hayley informs him that she knows he is a pedophile. She finds a safe with the photo of a missing girl. He denies any involvement in her disappearance. After some torture, he eventually admits to being a part of the crime.Up to this point it is a compelling story, but the twists and turns become a bit silly and contrived. Too many unnecessary plot devices with a silly ending spoil what could have been something as good as the little girl who lives down the lane.",Hard Candy
43,freemantle_uk,Psycho Thriller,7,15 October 2009,"Hard Candy was always going to get attention because of it's controversial subject matter. It's is a fairly decent thriller but could have been better.The film starts with a 14-year-old girl Hayley (Ellen Page) arranging a meeting Jeff (Patrick Wilson), a photography and in his early 30s. They meet at a café and both try to impress each other. Jeff invites Hayley back to his home, trying to impress the girl with his photos of models and music and both drink alcohol. However Hayley is not as innocent or naive as she first appears. Hayley drugs Jeff, and plans to torture the man for being a paedophile. Both play mind-games with each other, with Jeff trying to claim he is innocent.It is a simple premise, and it could have easily fallen into either exploration territory, or as a rape-revenge story. Luckily the filmmakers were smart enough to avoid this, and made the film as a thriller about right and wrong, and about revenge for a man's crimes. It was a pretty strong premise, and not out the realms of possibility. Neither Hayley or Jeff are particularly likable characters, which is often a suicidal move for a film, but it works with this film and makes for compelling viewing.Patrick Wilson is a good actor and was very strong in the film. He was convincing, and could be both slimy and sympathetic in the same role. Ellen Page was good at playing her character as naive girl and as a smart girl, but I wasn't so convinced of her performance as a psycho killer. But then that was the twist.The direction was decent, but could have been better. This was David Slade's first film, and it was a smart move on his part to do a small indie film and not just jump and do a big-budget blockbuster before he was ready. They are some good shots, like at the end, and during the surgery scene. He sets the tone and does a good twist at the right point, but he still suffers from stylist tricks because of his background as a music video director, such as the shaky effect. I think a more gritty, realistic style would have worked for the film.Brain Nelson wrote an okay script with a strong premise and a good twist. There is good dialogue and a interesting back story to Jeff, whilst there is mystery behind Hayley. Hayley is shown to be a smart, logical girl, poking holes in Jeff's story. But there are some plot holes, like how did Hayley know the neighbours were gone. It's also a little hard to believe a fourteen-year-old girl could be able to subdue a fully grown man or act the way she does and be so smart about everything at the same time.A decent film, but could have been stronger and better.",Hard Candy
44,Polaris_DiB,"Nope, not granted",3,25 July 2009,"I call nonsense.I don't believe in the ability of the average person to withstand that level of psychological torture, especially with that particular form of guilt. I'm not a big fan of Crime and Punishment, but there'd be something more mentally destructive in the main character which would lead to an ultimately different course of events than this one, leaving this movie with only the psychology of the Ellen Page character--who is something of a feminist Ubermensch who knows every detail of everything and has almost perfect control and prediction of every event that would happen, save one.With situations in movies where the filmmakers confront the audience with multiple characters that have psychological issues (in this case, one is a pedophile and the other a murderer), real care has to make sure both are believable and that their meeting isn't too contrived. It's a very hard thing to do, which is why most narrative forms only assume one character is out of their mind. In this case, reality is granted the murderer and she becomes a vengeance motif. However, her character is still immoral. Where's the justice in her running off? Is this movie supposed to scare us--or is this movie supposed to scare us into ""appropriate action"" as a warning to potential other evil-doers? I'm getting a strong sense of the latter, which I don't appreciate.Also, too many close-ups. This was not like Passion of Joan of Arc, where the minutia of the drama invoked intensity. In order to provide extra dramatic emphasis after already shooting nearly the entire movie in close-up, they had to do that miniDV effect where the shutter speed is slowed down to create jerky movements, a la 28 Days Later... It looked terrible and was distracting, and half the time it was hard to even look at the regular compositions because they were so devoid of information, only filled with intensity. The art design didn't help much either, as that guy's apartment created sharp backgrounds that bled into each other, leaving no sense of space or transition, making this movie essentially two floating heads arguing and freaking out for two hours.My friends love this movie. I've heard nothing but good things about it. I found it hateful and conniving.--PolarisDiB",Hard Candy

Was it, really? 'Cause that's the way it came across to me. And, I ask you - Is it considered ""normal"", in this day and age, for a 14-year-old girl to get gleeful pleasure out of cutting a guy's nuts off, while, at the same time, flippantly pondering over whether or not to leave him with one of his nuts still hanging as a gesture of her generous kind-heartedness?Well - Considering what other torturous activities that the scenery-chewing Hayley (the vindictive bitch) was capable of dishing out (without even batting an eye), then I'd say that that puts her about on par with the likes of your everyday, garden-variety paedophile. In other words, folks - Hayley Stark was, seriously, one frickin' sick, little chick.All-in-all - I found Hard Candy's story just too demented to swallow at face value. If this film was supposed to be considered ""entertainment"", then, from where I was sitting, it certainly scraped the absolute bottom of the barrel. And it took the meaning of the word ""ugly"" to a whole new level of repulsiveness.And, finally - Am I the only one who was bugged by how determined this film was at trying to drive home the point that being a paedophile and/or child-molester was strictly a ""male"" thing, when, in fact, it isn't?",Hard Candy
49,kevin_robbins,This is a movie that pushes the limits in some ways and falls flat in others leading to an above average but not fantastic film,7,13 September 2021,"Hard Candy (2005) is a movie I recently rewatched and is available on Tubi, Vudu and Prime. The storyline follows a high school underage teenager who has been talking to a photographer online. They meet in person and she seems vulnerable and naive and the photographer seems to be prepared to take advantage of her...but looks can be deceiving. This movie was directed by David Slade (30 Days of Night) and stars Elliot Page (Juno), Patrick Wilson (The Conjuring) and Sandra Oh (Grey's Anatomy). The storyline for this had a lot of potential and starts well with some awkward and very uncomfortable scenes, circumstances and conversations. The film quickly turns course and doesn't feel as authentic and realistic the second half. I also wished the torture and revenge aspects were more intense and contained more horror elements; instead, the director relied on dialogue to create the intensity which bored and disappointed me at times. The cast is well selected and delivers their performances well. Overall this is a movie that pushes the limits in some ways and falls flat in others leading to an above average but not fantastic film.

50,meeza,Go Ballistic!,9,1 May 2006,"There is a ghastly taste to the independent film ""Hard Candy"" which you will digest in no other flick this year. Not to say that the film is inferior because ""Hard Candy"" is a stunning alternative perspective of revengeful methods that youthful internet targets can undertake on their ""too-much-time-on-their-hands"" pedophile solicitors. For the male generation, it just might be the scariest film you will ever see! I will fill you in on those ball-breaking reasons in just a few. Ellen Page stars as Hayley, a brainiac 14 year old fem teen whose jargon is that of a successful adult yuppie. Like many of her peer teens, she craves the internet for educational but most notably for social reasons. Patrick Wilson plays Jeff, the pedophile yuppie who solicits Hayley and craves to investigate ""Haley's Comet"". Hayley initiates a personal meeting between them both at a coffee shop. Then before you can say ""You Got Trouble"", Haley is in Jeff's apartment. However, the only ""nasty"" that is done there is the vengeful antics of Haley to Jeff. This is the ultimate film on the torturous actions a woman can inject on a man. Haley drugs, entraps, and torments Jeff physically and mentally. To go into details of these acts, would be a distasteful review act to the future viewers of ""Hard Candy"". However, I do have the balls to say that the castration scene of ""Hard Candy"" was a real nutcracker! Patrick Wilson and Ellen Page were stunning with their performances! Here is a simple ""instant message"" to the Academy: Nominate Wilson and Page as Best Actor & Actress. Page is a ""star waiting to happen"". I am sure Ellen Page's pager will be buzzing numerous times with calls from studio producers. Wilson will also bounce his way to many lucrative leading acting gigs. Screenplayer Brian Nelson's witty and menacing scribe was verbally chewy enough to make it the not-so-sweet tooth ""Hard Candy"" needed to its vengeful plot line. Director David Spade, I mean Slade, was stylish in his development and execution of ""Hard Candy"" to create a low-budget flick that is his breakthrough to make him a future potential ""Showbiz Show"" Director so he can have more of ""what's in your wallet?"" ""Hard Candy"" sporadically does overextend its log on time of Haley's fixated deviousness.

The basis of the movie is a supposedly mid-aged teenager sets out to teach an older man a lesson who tries to befriend a certain age of girl in chat rooms. That's about as PC as I can put it. There are really only two characters in the whole film who do a great job in acting out the tense situations. The production value, color usage and shot framing were wisely executed and the key scenes of the climax for the tension capture the psychological anguish rather than visually tossing it the viewer's face. I was a bit surprised by how easily the girl got the upper hand in situations that needed ample planning; potential plot holes if you look for them. It was a difficult watch also because the two characters are rotten people so no one really to root for.well, you kind of root for a bad guy as you slowly learn about him.

And let me say that Elliot Page is perElliot Pagefect for the role, too perfect.""Torture? Is this torture to you? Because wow, I guess you've never read anything about Amnesty International or Human Rights Watch, because this... this is nothing.""Don't get it twisted. Hard Candy doesn't display any sort of apologist material for the context of which the film is subject. This is purely a sort of revenge, drama thriller. Brian Nelson wrote this absolutely phenomenal script, he also wrote a series adaptation of an acclaimed Stephen King novel, 11.22.63 (2016), which I was a huge fan of. I haven't seen Devil (2010) or 30 Days of Night (2007) as of yet, and while they are low rated, a script can only go so far.David Slade also directed Black Mirror: Bandersnatch (2017) & the critically acclaimed entry to the Twilight Saga, Eclipse (2010). Hard Candy is by far his best film. It's wild, daring & especially uncomfortable given Ellen Page's age of 17 years during filming. Page is such an incredible actress, she embodies the vengeful young teenager named Hayley. At first, you aren't aware of her plan. She's looking to hurt an older man, a predator she met online. While I normally don't go too in-depth on a films plot in my write up to avoid spoilers, I feel as though some is needed to sell this film. It is chilling, creepy & down right weird at times.

53,dwpollar,Effective yet sadistic...,7,14 December 2009,"1st watched 12/13/2009 – 7 out of 10 (Dir-David Slade): Effective yet sadistic portrayal of a teenage girl turning the tables on an online older guy who may be a stalker of young girls. This movie grips you from the very beginning due to the way it's directed by David Slade and because of the wonderful performances although it loses you a little near the end. Without giving away too much, it starts out as a girl communicates with an older man online and agrees to meet up with him at a coffee shop. They flirt with each other, she does stupid things like getting in her car and going to his place. Then, at his place, she turns the tables by spiking his drink, knocking him out and then ties him up and tortures him emotionally & physically. Ellen Page and Patrick Wilson are almost perfect in their portrayals but near the end the plot gets really confusing, at least to me(maybe I just couldn't keep up with it). Anyway, Slade has created another excellent movie setting the eerie mood and bringing us into this game that is being played out by both parties. It's hard for me to say I enjoyed watching the movie, with it's attack on the male ego and one specific attack on the male private parts done by the girl in one excruciatingly long scene – but it definitely left you thinking even when it was over. Be prepared to feel uneasy when you watch this, but watch it. The movie is well made with wonderful performances despite it's unsettling theme.",Hard Candy
54,drownnnsoda,Captivating and Hard Hitting - A Movie You Won't Forget.,9,12 November 2006,"""Hard Candy"" is one unique, disturbing film that had me thinking about it for hours. The movie opens with an instant messenger screen, where a seemingly older man is talking to a young girl about sexual matters he really shouldn't be discussing with someone of her age. The two agree to meet each other. Cut to a coffee shop, where the seemingly innocent fourteen-year-old Hayley (Ellen Page) meets the thirty-something man, Jeff (Patrick Wilson). After some coffee and discussion, Hayley goes to Jeff's house which is basically one giant studio where Jeff photographs his young ""models"". But the tables of danger are soon turned when Jeff awakens after having a few drinks, bound to a chair. It turns out this young girl isn't quite as innocent as she appears, and she begins to enact revenge on Jeff and reveal his scandalous past.Not only is this film disturbing solely because of the subject matter (internet predators and pedophilia), but the way the story is presented is what makes the film even more disturbing. I can confidently say I've never seen a film quite like this ever, and that's a good thing. The writing and script are excellent and very masterfully done, the dialog flows well and the story is intricately but perfectly plotted. One of the strong points of this film is the way it turns the tables so swiftly. Within the first twenty minutes, the audience is worried about Hayley's well being. She's a young girl who's meeting an older man whom she doesn't know over the internet - so of course we're going to assume that he's playing the role of the pedophile antagonist, leaving her the victim. But shortly thereafter, everything completely and unexpectedly reverses. Now, Hayley is the antagonist, and Jeff is the one who has become the victim in this game. Interesting concept.Along with that, the actors in this film are needed to hold everything together, and they do it perfectly. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen, that's how captivating it was. Patrick Wilson plays the role of the internet predator precisely, and although we do end up sympathizing with him on many occasions, he's still the one who has invited a fourteen year old into his house - therefore he is still considered a dangerous character. While he plays his role very well, Ellen Page is really the one who shines here. She kind reminds me of a younger Jennifer Jason Leigh. Her performance in this movie is flawless - she plays her character with a meek vulnerability in the beginning of the film, but as things progress and events unfold, she becomes a much more dark, twisted, and sophisticated character who has managed to undermine Jeff. She's very talented to say the least, and I can't wait to see what she'll do next. All things considered though, the performances in this film were award-worthy and were very believable.This film doesn't just succeed as a drama, but also as a thriller with some horrific moments and even a little bit of comedy thrown into the mix. It's a thriller more than anything I'd say, and a good one at that. I wasn't bored once in the entire film, everything was just so perfectly executed that it's hard not to be drawn into it all. Plus, there were some really cringe-inducing moments that were very cleverly done by Hayley's character - she's one smart kid.Overall, ""Hard Candy"" is a provocative, disturbing, and well-plotted classic revenge story with a different, more modern subject that is sadly seen in this day and age. The flawless performances really drive the film, and let me tell you, it's one hell of a ride. A highly recommended thriller, it's a movie you won't forget that will stick with you for days after viewing. 9/10.",Hard Candy

They been chatting on-line for a couple of weeks. When Jeff decides to bring Hayley to his home for couple of drinks and taking some photos of her. Jeff finds himself drugged and tied up by this teenager. She turns the tables on him, when Jeff might be a pedophile. Hayley starts questioning his judgment by meeting her and the mysterious missing girl, who's been missing for weeks. But Hayley and Jeff are two different person are not what they seems to be.Directed by David Slade (30 Days of Night) made an effective thriller with moments of suspense and dark humour. Wilson and especially Page are extremely good in this independent film. This disturbing drama does have an message and warning towards teenagers and pedophiles. This movie has an perverse fascinating, which makes this interesting. Although it wasn't quite the success what Lions Gate hoping for at the box office, despite getting good reviews by critics. This is the kind of film, which it will do better on DVD.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an good-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has two informative commentary tracks. Commentary one is by the director and screen-writer:Brian Nelson. Commentary two is by the actors:Wilson and Page. DVD also has an Documentary, Featurettes, Deleted Scenes and more. Perphas the flaws in this movie are towards the third act, where the plot holes and unsatisfying story turns appears. Despite good performances by the leads, these characters are unlikeable and selfish. The viewer also cannot root for Page's character, whatever if her views are good or bad. Despite all this, it is certainly worth seeing. Super 35. (****/*****).",Hard Candy
56,EVOL666,A Strong Film That Bravely Tackles Strong Subject-Matter...,9,26 September 2006,"***Lots of spoilers in this one - you probably don't wanna read this unless you've already seen the film*** The basic themes of HARD CANDY revolve on the one subject that really gets under my skin - pedophilia. Those that read my reviews know that I watch some of the sickest films on the planet - but things involving children in blatantly sexual situations is my ""line"". The good thing about this film, is that it reverses the typical roles of ""predator"" and ""victim"", and offers a ballsy (pardon the pun for those that have seen it...) film to those that can handle the subject-matter...Hayley is a 14-year-old who ""meets"" Jeff, a 32-year-old photographer in an internet chat-room. After some back-and-forth flirting, the two arrange a face-to-face. They meet at a coffee-shop and the pair hit it off and decide to go back to Jeff's house to hang out for a bit. Back at Jeff's home, the two talk for a while about completely inappropriate subjects for a 14-year-old girl and 32-year-old man to be discussing. Hayley mixes some some screwdrivers for the two to enjoy - but we quickly find that only one of them will be enjoying their drink. Abruptly we realize that Hayley has spiked Jeff's drink, and when he wakes up tied to a chair, we are aware that the film is now going to go in a completely different direction. Hayley unleashes a fire-storm of hate and disgust on Jeff and begins to torture him psychologically and mentally - until the end, where a slight ""twist"" is revealed that drives the whole film home all the harder...Honestly, HARD CANDY is a great film. I first give credit to the writer, director, and Lionsgate for putting this film together, despite the ""unpleasant"" content. A very brave move on all of their behalfs. As for the film itself - there's very little to fault with it. The performances by both leads are VERY strong, and this is a ""must"" being that the whole film revolves around them and almost all of the ""action"" takes place in Jeff's house. If the film would have had poor performances, it would have died on the vine. The cinematography was strong (if a bit overly-stylized at times), and the almost total lack of a musical score underlined the realism of the film a bit more. Though nothing truly graphic is ever shown, HARD CANDY does a good job of building and maintaining tension throughout the entire film. Another surprise was how quickly it jumps into the action. I thought it was going to be a lot more of a ""slow-burner"" - so I was pleasantly surprised when things get going strong right from the beginning. My only real gripe is that the script-writing was so ""tight"" that it often felt...well, scripted. The banter between the two leads, though well-acted, seemed a little too ""sharp"" to be believable as being spontaneous and borne of the situation at hand. Also, Ellen Page's performance as Hayley is SO strong as to make it nearly impossible to believe that this planning, and plotting, and ""execution"" could actually come from a 14-year-old girl. She plays such a bad-ass that she elevates the character of Hayley to almost super-heroic proportions. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it takes a small bit of the focus off the fact that Jeff is dealing with a little girl, not a grown woman - making his character almost ""sympathetic"" which I doubt was the director's intention. If so, it's the wrong message to give in a film about a child molester. It's also never really explained ""who"" Hayley is, or if she's even really 14 - which could be considered a good or bad thing, depending on just how ""wrapped-up"" you like your films. Regardless of what I considered to be minor flaws - HARD CANDY is still an extremely well-made film that I highly recommend for thriller fans. Also, the bit of ""twist"" at the end really nails everything down as we learn that this isn't Hayley's first run at this sort of thing. Great film, definitely a stand-out and worth a look...9/10",Hard Candy
57,kairingler,teenage tease,8,5 August 2008,"Wow.. first a word of caution... this film is very graphic and depicts a castration scene. so with that said, a teenage girl courts an older guy on the internet, leads to a meeting, she figures he might be a pedophile, and starts to dig up the dirt on him,,interesting premise .. never seen that in a movie before, the movie doesn't have many characters, but then it really doesn't need many,, you have you're 2 main characters,, and that's all it needs really , the story is really plot driven , to find out what the guy did or did not do.. the girl flirts with the guy,, even teases him somewhat, but he doesn't seem to take the bait right away,, although he does try to serve her alcohol. this is a movie not for the faint of heart, it deals with serious subject matter, and should be treated as such,, all in all i liked the movie, it was different, and very interesting.",Hard Candy
58,fertilecelluloid,Showy two-hander bereft of plausibility and thrills,4,8 May 2006,"Director David Slade's feature film debut is a showy two-hander that is capsized by implausibility and a fourteen-year-old antagonist (Ellen Page) who spits cynical adult dialog so ludicrous and arch it derails the tension. The most irritating aspect of the film is the way characters telegraph upcoming developments. There is next to no tension and the inevitable comeuppance of the ""predator"" is protracted and boring. In a nutshell, Page and Wilson meet after hooking up in a chat room. Although Wilson is aware that he's playing with fire, he doesn't put the brakes on it when he should have. Page's initial reaction to Wilson's moderate behavior seems overwrought at first, but there is a sting in the film's tail that possesses some resonance. I am not sure why Page describes herself as a ""cute"" fourteen-year-old because she is not. She looks like a young boy, in fact, and would be more at home in a Larry Clark movie. Artificial and slick, and, for a thriller, sorely lacking in thrills. Comparisons to ""Fatal Attraction"" are wishful, misguided hype.",Hard Candy
59,aharmas,Angel of Death,10,30 April 2006,"For the second year in a row, one of the most intense and visceral performances of the year comes from an actress who is not even 18 years old. The uncanny, masterful, and disturbing command of the screen by this teenager will rattle a few people. She is after all, holding her own against Patrick Wilson, an actor who has done Broadway and was part of the superb ""Angels in America"" cast. For most of the movie's running time, she is at the center of the action, and the success of the film depends on how she handles this controversial material. Ellen Page never makes a wrong move. Her range is amazing, from defenseless and innocent to ruthless and sadistic.Page plays an apparently upset teen who has decided to put an end to a rather dangerous child molester. It is her approach that disturbs us. She decides that she won't trust the authorities with his removal from society. She has chosen to perform a drastic operation to prevent him from causing any further harm to girls like her.As the movie unfolds, the audience goes through several disturbing and tense scenes as this exceptional girl keeps the upper hand in her relationship with her victim. The scenes where she exposes his victim's ultimate fears are some of the most powerful scenes involving any actor in the movies. Page never overacts but modulates her voice, and she uses her body to convey emotions that will upset anyone that sees this film. It is utterly believable that she can bring an adult male to his knees and destroy him both physically and emotionally.What I found most interesting about his film is how quiet the members of the audience were. There was no cheering for her victories or any personal attacks to her methods. There was utter disbelief that anyone could have thought a script that dealt such a powerful reversal of roles. Both Page and Wilson should receive recognition for their performances as a couple whose lives will never be the same after their paths cross, with some very disturbing and tragic results.",Hard Candy
60,Jonny_Numb,"""Hard Candy"" Bites",5,13 May 2006,"SPOILERS. You have been warned.I'll admit I occasionally enjoy a challenge when I sit down to watch a movie. I feel in such a way when I examine the works of Lynch and Cronenberg, two directors who pull the audience's strings with reckless abandon and twisted logic, yet for all they refuse to divulge, never leave us completely empty-handed. Their films may be grotesque and ambiguous, but contain enough innovation to keep us strangely enraptured.Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of ""Hard Candy,"" director David Slade's blurry morality play that delves into the distasteful arena of pedophilia. While a sensitive subject, Slade's handling of the material is done in a detached manner that forgoes graphic details in favor of a third-person omniscient point of viewour perspective is neither Hayley (Ellen Page) nor Jeff (Patrick Wilson), but that of an outsider peeking into a creepy standoff between two unhinged characters. That's rightthis is a film where the line between tormentor and tormented is a big zig-zag until the very end. And that, apparently, is the whole pointwith both characters participating in acts that are morally reprehensible, who do you 'side' with? Hayley is a 14-year old girl who has been corresponding with 32-year old photographer Jeff on the Internet; when Jeff proposes a real-life meeting, Hayley guardedly obliges. Soon after some small talk in a coffee shop, they both go back to Jeff's secluded-in-the-hills house/photography studio. Shortly after Hayley mixes a few screwdrivers, Jeff blacks out and wakes up bound to a chair, listening to accusations of pedophilia and murder. The remainder of the film is a cat-and-mouse game where the more Jeff reveals about his past, the more Hayley seems to get the upper hand.That's one of the film's problems. Unlike Lynch or Cronenberg, whose films are propelled by a completely unique logic, ""Hard Candy"" is grounded in reality, to the point where its excesses seem purely theatrical. Though it eventually brings up the idea that everything about Hayley is a fabrication, it doesn't let the filmmakers off the hook for presenting her as a Freddy Krueger for the female setalways one step ahead of her 'victim', without fail, to the point where her closing words come as absolutely no surprise whatsoever. She is as consistent in her machinations as Jeff is with his excuses, pleas, and (ultimately) lies.The crux of ""Hard Candy,"" and what has no doubt earned it a significant amount of praise, is its ambiguous moral baiting. Hayley is clearly disturbed beyond just wanting to put a pedophile in his place; Jeff at first seems like a decent fellow, but is presented as increasingly dissolving as the film progresses, and eventually comes to terms with his repressed impulses (even going so far as to ""thank"" his underage tormentor in an unnecessary moment), becoming what Hayley ultimately prophesied. That Hayley's crimes are presented in real-time, while Jeff's are merely recollected, cleverly (and manipulatively) puts us in a position where we are more willing to associate with the weakened male, and we immediately scold ourselves for it. But can we necessarily associate with Hayley and her castration-minded ways when her torment borders on its own sadistic pleasure? In the end, the only conclusion I could come to was that neither character was redeemable for their actions. Is that the 'deeper meaning'? As ""Hard Candy"" jerks us back and forth in search of a non-existent answer to what is ""just"" in crime and punishment, Page and Wilson turn in excellent performances. David Slade's direction is distinctive and minimalist, with a keen inclination for pacing and building suspense. Brian Nelson's script is good enough, but its ambitions of crossing the woman-fearing excess of ""Audition"" with the heavy-handed social conscience of ""Crash"" (2004) comes off unevenly. ""Hard Candy"" ultimately leaves the viewer in a pit of apathy and contrivances that will inspire more frustration than debate.",Hard Candy
61,nycritic,Little Red Riding Hood Meets the Big Bad Wolf,10,14 April 2006,"Online predators. It's stuff that even when it hits news and horrifies people, it's still not being tackled the way it should be. Every day you hear horror stories spawning from people who own blogs, or people who have MySpace.com profiles containing too much (or false) information and the repercussions that ensue. Everyone knows someone who has met someone online who turned out to be someone either just fake, a little disturbing, or a full-fledged sicko. And it's no secret that the Internet is a haven for hordes of predators of all shapes, ages, and sizes, all looking to let loose to their fantasies, even the most sick and disgusting ones.HARD CANDY explores online pedophiles. Reportedly being loosely based on Japanese girls turning the tables on older men by luring them into meeting with them with the sole purpose of beating them up, this is a taut, two character, nail-biting suspense thriller about Hayley Stark, a shy fourteen year old who has agreed to meet up with Jeff Kohlver, a man over twice her age whom she has been chatting with. At the very start of the film this is what we see: their Internet conversation, flirtatious, inviting, with the promise of foreplay. Awkward conversation ensues between them over coffee (while in the background, briefly visible, is the picture of Donna Murphy, a girl who has gone missing) and both exchange similar interests.That is, until Hayley, in a bold move that makes her look like the open innocent she seems to be, decides that maybe they can talk better at his place. It turns out, he accepts, and shows her not only his swanky house in the Hollywood hills, but his collections of pictures of models. She seems to know one of them -- Janelle -- and is all wide eyed at the knowledge that Jeff is a pretty hotshot photographer. He offers her drinks, gets her tipsy -- even when she warns him that she's been taught not to accept drinks from people when she hasn't prepared them herself. If only Jeff himself had listen to this faint, yet frank warning.He awakens up tied to a chair, and thinks she's still playing with him. She is not. Now she is dead serious. She is out to get him in the worst possible ways -- just how far she will go is up to the viewer to find out, because in the blink of an eye, Hayley transforms from a frail looking waif to an adult capable of as much monstrosities as Jeff has because, after all, there is the question all throughout the film -- we know he's a pedophile, but was he involved in the disappearance of a certain Donna Murphy? He maintains his innocence while trying to manipulate himself out of his predicament, and thus begins a tremendous, terrific battle of wills and of the sexes as Hayley decides to punish Jeff, and Jeff can only sit there and watch her do it and scream.There is more than a passing resemblance to the Asian horror flick ODISHON. Do you really know the person you are agreeing to meet? Both men, Aoyama and Jeff, find out in the most brutal of ways, and in both movies, their realization is a squeamish sit. Because the women (Asami and Hayley) in both movies are so resourceful, they are always in control. But because this is an allegory about getting even with a pedophile, Hayley's upper hand is believable and her line where she identifies herself with every girl who was molested and killed should resonate. Even so, there are a couple of moments when it seemed the movie was going to give Jeff the upper hand and transform the last act into a damsel in peril sequence reminiscent of WAIT UNTIL DARK, but the script is very well written and still wants to take some left turns -- all believable -- to resolve matters in its own way. Ellen Page and Patrick Wilson are both excellent as they lock horns against each other in this power play and should find with this movie their breakout, since Wilson plays against his William Hurt, boyish prettiness -- I could perceive a creepiness just under his almost flawless face --, and Page doesn't make Hayley look too much in control, but occasionally in wonder that she has come this far in her plan. It's their pairing that makes HARD CANDY such a terrific study in survival, especially when in the lair of the big bad wolf.",Hard Candy
62,raulfaust,I never told you what I do for a living,8,10 March 2014,"Well, ""Hard Candy"" is just a good surprise to me. Whilst I was used to see movies in which the main subject concerns on the pedophiles themselves, this case is a little different. In here, there's a dangerous girl who tortures a man who supposedly raped some youngsters and killed one, but the movie doesn't let you know if he actually did that until some point. One thing that truly makes this film different from the others are the directing and editing; they're completely ODD, and sometimes I wondered if it was a big or small production. On the other hand, the photography direction isn't that suitable, given that it caused me the impression of seeing an old picture-- by the way, it isn't even 10 years old. Both main actors prove to be quite talented, and maybe this movie is the reason why Patrick Wilson is so famous nowadays. The story is really thrilling, using elements of psychological thrillers with manipulating characters, which occasionally remembered me of Haneke's ""Funny Games"". It is a strong movie in many aspects, with very intelligent conversations and situations, and I should congratulate the writer Brian Nelson for such good work. One of the best films made in 2005, undoubtedly.",Hard Candy
63,Kingslaay,Very disturbing and baseless,2,27 February 2017,"Hard Candy is a very disturbing film on many levels. We see an unbalanced teenager seek out a 32 year old man, drug him and torture him in his apartment. The film tries to be ambiguous by revealing less but sadly so little was revealed it did not make sense. The teenager tortures a man accusing him of pedophilia and snippets of the film later reveal he has this problem and might have killed a missing girl's death, but this is not confirmed. The why is never explored, why and what is the point? In fact at the beginning he never took advantage of her and said he will wait for her to be legal. I and many other viewers on this board have expressed their sympathy for the tortured man and hate for the girl. We rooted for his escape so he could teach her lesson. The castration has to be most disgusting scene I have ever seen in film, the holocaust would be easier. How can you expect a male to watch this atrocious scene. This deserves a very low rating indeed. People who would like this film are probably unbalanced and troubled as is this director and his team. The female protagonist of the film said she had seen 5 doctors but anyone who praises this film certainly needs a team of doctors.",Hard Candy
64,Sandcooler,Dark and twisted,9,11 December 2011,"The main attraction of ""Hard Candy"" is not in finding a character you can like, but rather in deciding which character you hate the least. It bathes in an unsettling atmosphere, and the tension is at times just unbearable. It's overall a pretty intense experience, it's not exactly the type of movie you'd bring to a casual film night. Most people have heard of this movie because of its infamous castration scene, but the rest of it isn't really less painful. It's a very well-crafted piece of cinema that just leaves you no room to recover. The only flaw it really has is that sometimes the plot can be a little contrived, and the characters' actions can get somewhat illogical. If you were holding someone captive in his own house, would you really open the door when someone knocks? The ending isn't particularly realistic either, come to think about it. Still, it doesn't hurt the power the movie has. Definitely worth seeing.",Hard Candy

66,DeeNine-2,"Totally sick, but compelling",7,6 August 2009,"***BEWARE SPOILERS*** ***If you read this before seeing the movie, the movie will not be as interesting***This is a taunt drama of the man bites dog sort in which a precocious 14-year-old girl Hayley (Ellen Page, who was so delightful in Juno (2007)) has her way with photographer Jeff Kohlver (Patrick Wilson) a 32-year-old sickie who specializes in under aged girls. And her way iswell, way extreme. But apparently she has cause.The vibrant tension that glues us to our seats can only be resolved by finding out if she is right in her accusations or if he is an innocent victim. She is certain. But director David Slade (using a diabolical script from Brian Nelson) keeps us guessing. Hayley seems not merely precocious intellectually, but emotionally more like a grown woman than a 14-year-old. Jeff appears to be a sweet, clever guy any girl would love to love. But she has anything but love in mind. Her scheme of vengeance is well thought out and very well executed. Everything is a twist on the Internet chat room stalker scenario. Instead of the older dude seducing, drugging and taking advantage of the young girl, the young girl turns the tables on him in a horrifying way. What is it that should happen to guys who take advantage of under-aged girls? They should have their s cut off. That is exactly what Hayley has in mind.Or so it seems. Actually, although she says at one point that death is too good for him, she finally settles on getting him to commit suicide. But will he?I was hoping that Nelson and Slade would have the nerve to really turn the tables and make Hayley the villain and Jeff the innocent victim, and it seems for perhaps three-quarters of the film that this is still possible. We learn that he does have a thing for under aged girls and that is not good, but it isn't enough to justify what he is going through and will go through. And Hayley seems to be some kind of monster with a sick desire of her own. But this all washes out when we discover that no he didn't actually kill the girl. No, he only--as he confesses--FILMED the killing. (Nice touch, that.) And no Hayley does not go through with her Third Reich surgery (although she has brought along a blue surgeon's gown for the operation and has donned it). That would make her just too, too unsavory. Instead she uses her wiles and her physical and psychological control to get him to jump off a roof with a rope around his neck. (Yes, I warned you about spoilers.)I mention all these essential details because I want to make a point. This is a seduction of the audience film and a kind of black comedy that isn't funny until perhaps you see it for the second or third time--which I am not planning to do. It is absurd in the slasher/horror film manner in which gross human behavior is depicted for the titillation of the audience while maintaining a politically correct stance. A politically incorrect stance would have been to end the film with Jeff innocent and Hayley the sickie. I suspect this film would have met with boycotts from women's groups had Slade done that.Still the violence is mostly imagined or alluded to. Slade eschews any blood splattering or outright torture. The balls in the garbage disposal are, after all, only in our imagination. And Jeff really does deserve his fate. However there is no getting around the fact that Hayley is not your everyday 14-year-old. I don't think any future suitor would feel comfortable with her knowing what she did to Jeff, evil as he is. In other words, her brand of vigilante justice could only come from somebody who was a bit sick herself.I think what mesmerized me most about this exercise in fantasy revenge wish fulfillment was the performance of Ellen Page. I thought she was a bit creepy but very effective. She actually could have passed for a 14-year-old (she was 18 when the film was released) yet the words put in her mouth and the actions she performed were well beyond the reach of the vast majority of fourteen-year-olds. The intense close ups of her face and that of her co-star Patrick Wilson helped to make the characters larger than life, which is one of the things that film can do so very well.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

Then again - there are a lot of sick people out there both like Haley and like the 32 year old. This is a tale of where the two types of evil come together and then the insanity happens.

68,pyrocitor,"Visceral, disturbing and completely engrossing",8,1 July 2006,"Hard CandyGiven the domineering themes of pedophilia, online dating and date rape, it's not at all surprising that Hard Candy was passed up by most major theaters, and as such the audience which will end up seeing it will likely remain quite restricted. Which, although very much making a sense is almost a shame in the sense that despite the brutal and disturbing content the quality of this movie is unmistakable, and deserves more credit than it will likely receive. The fact that a movie propelled by essentially two performances could be so relentlessly gripping, suspenseful and horrifying is to be commended indeed, and stars Ellen Page and Patrick Wilson deserve rave reviews for their extraordinary performances, especially Page, the star of the show who easily walks away with the picture as the deceptively sly, cunning yet innocent looking 14 year old girl outsmarting her adversary who is over twice her age. Also watch for an enjoyable cameo from Canadian actress Sandra Oh as a good hearted neighbour of Patrick Wilson's photographer character. Yet director David Slade also deserves quite a bit of credit for keeping the pace going at such a breakneck rate that the audience is almost never given a chance to catch their breath and slowly pry their fingers from the armrests of their seats, and also for employing some genuinely beautiful and stylish cinematography, truly allowing the picture to flourish. The script by Brian Nelson is also intelligent and visceral, not afraid of pushing boundaries - the actors, especially Page are given respectively some delightfully clever or chilling lines to say, and there are some genuinely surprising and tense twists along the way. All in all, Hard Candy is definitely worth a watch for those ready for a genuinely intense and emotionally brutal experience. Viewer discretion is most definitely advised, but for those up to it, this Candy may be very hard indeed, but the result in the end is definitely sweet. -9/10",Hard Candy
69,oneguyrambling,An exceptional film that's exceptionally hard to enjoy.,8,1 March 2012,"Hard Candy is a film in three acts.1. The first is disturbing and deals with a situation that frankly grosses me the f*** out.2. The second act of the film actually grows darker (and has a long scene that gets my stomach churning just thinking about it).3. The final act brings with it still more twists and turns before a depressing ending.So what are you waiting for film lovers? Get out and watch it! Strangely enough for a movie with such a dark tone and featuring some pretty graphic dialogue and events there is much to recommend in Hard Candy, call it an exceptional film that is equally exceptionally hard to enjoy.I'll keep my summation of the plot events to the first act, but rest assured the tables are turned many times after that, and regardless of where you think the film is headed there is a fair chance you are way off the mark.When the two main characters in the story first meet (in person) in a coffee shop they only know each other by their chat room handles. ""Lensman319"" is 32 and at first glance appears a balanced upstanding citizen, until you realise that this quasi-date is with ""thongrrrl"", who is a 14 year old boyish in appearance girl.Lensman319 is actually Jeff (Patrick Wilson) and thongrrrl is Hayley (Ellen Page). The pair met online and agreed to a public meeting, which after a few minutes chat Jeff convinces Hayley that they should head back to his place with the promise of MP3s.In the car park Hayley is impressed with Jeff's small car. She thinks it's cute Back at Jeff's large, trendy pad, replete with photography studio and decked out with multiple photos of young female models, and Hayley is obviously impressed and inquisitive.Hayley is boyish, whip-smart and talkative, but you get the feeling that she is perhaps trying a little too hard to be impressive, on top of that the opening sequence has already convinced the viewer that things might not go according to plan for someone here How right we are.Jeff on the other hand is actually pretty cool and says a bunch of non-predator things but I mentioned the photos on the walls of young girls right? And the impressive and trendy home is quite isolated and out of the way omens that don't bode well.After some drinks, some frank discussion expressing mutual admiration and some seemingly good natured teasing the tone of the film – which was hardly playful before – changes dramatically and the pace and intensity quickens.I'll leave the descriptions there. I can say that the tone of the film changes, vibrant colours are replaced by washed out pale shades and dim lighting.The tone of the dialogue becomes far more frank and uncomfortable, with both parties exchanging and disclosing uncomfortable truths. It turns out that both parties had plans not mentioned prior to the coffee shop meeting, though none of them go exactly as planned.The film takes place in only two locations, the coffee shop and Jeff's home, though the action moves to almost every room in his house over the duration, this confined space creates only more tension. Coupled with the fact that there is no background music and that for 99% of the film only 2 characters on screen and we are left to wriggle uncomfortably almost in real time as everything is spelt out and unravels.Again this is spoiler free but one scene in particular ratchets up the ""icky-factor"" to truly squirm-worthy levels, I distinctly recall the sinking feel in my gut as it played out – keep in mind also that I have seen the film a couple times before and knew the outcome already In the interest of not giving more away I will leave it there, as hard as it is to recommend Hard Candy on an enjoyment level I suggest that those mature enough to differentiate cinema from real life will find much to admire, it is uncomfortable, but it is also unpredictable and riveting, and you'll go a long way before you see better performances from two lead actors. Big ups especially to Ellen Page in her debut, I saw this before Juno and Inception, and was left with zero doubt that she was destined for big things before the credits even rolled.Hard Candy – 8 / 10. Just because this Candy might be difficult to enjoy doesn't mean that it isn't any good. Brutal and unflinching – yet nevertheless quality – filmmaking and brilliant performances make Hard Candy a painfully rewarding couple of hours.",Hard Candy
70,xredgarnetx,Intriguing,7,23 September 2006,"The oddly named HARD CANDY is misrepresented in IMDb's plot summary. An bookwormish high school 14 year old flirts online with an older man, and ends up in his house for a gritty encounter that plays out more or less in real time. The man, played by Anthony Edwards lookalike Patrick Wilson, is a self-proclaimed photographer of very young females, and a likely pedophile. The teen, played by Canadian actress Ellen Page, has a back story that only comes out fairly late in the proceedings, but it's fair to say she may not be as bookwormish as she first appears. Edwards is extremely convincing as a possible predator. Page, in real life an adult, is OK, but is weighed down by a load of dialogue in this essentially two-person play that doesn't always ring true. CANDY is clearly an indie, as much a horror movie as a thriller. While no blood is spilled on screen, a couple of scenes are cringe-inducing and resulted m in the movie's ""R"" rating. Adult language and adult themes also played their part, I'm sure. Not a film for the mainstream, so beware. I would have welcomed a few more characters worked into the script to liven things up through the somewhat sluggish second half.",Hard Candy

I don't know where Patrick Wilson started his either, but both of these actors are terrific. They are terrific both together and by themselves. Page, already nominated for an Oscar in her life, is a terrific actress. If this is indeed her first film, then she must've been genius her entire career. Patrick Wilson, i've never seen before this.

I had to fast forward the ""castration"" operation because I felt overwhelmed. Then it turned out she didn't cut off anything when he untied himself. She managed to put the noose around his neck and wanted him to commit suicide. But he got to untie himself again. She lured him to the rooftop and wanted him to put the noose around his neck and take his own life so she wouldn't tell anybody anything. His biggest love Janelle arrived and he jumped off the roof with the noose around his neck and she said she won't handle anything at home regarding his pedophilia. Her name and story were all fake. Her name wasn't Hayley. She was probably somehow related to the missing girl. I think he killed the missing girl with a friend of his and Hayley made him commit suicide too. She just left the house without no one noticing. It was disturbing and annoying but that doesn't mean it's a flat out bad film. I didn't find it very plausible that a predator can kill himself even when he's not suicidal. I suppose he'd kill the girl and even that very beloved woman who showed up but he'd not kill him self. That felt a bit too far fetched.",Hard Candy
73,bobsgrock,Very intense.,8,14 July 2008,"In a pure indie film with very little music or special effects; just plenty of strong dialogue between two good actors and solid directing, Hard Candy makes its impact in more ways than one. Just from the opening scene, it is pretty obvious this movie is not going to be pretty or exciting to watch. After meeting in a local coffee shop, the two head off to his house and all the audience can think is of the possibility that he (Jeff) could seduce her (Hayley) and make this a typical seduction Hollywood story. However, this is not Hollywood but the indie world, and soon it is Jeff that is drugged and tied down and Hayley begins to intensely scrutinize him for possible offenses he may have committed. Certainly not for children, this is extremely disturbing material despite the film never crossing the line to show graphic violence or sexual conduct.

It tackles a common problem in society of an adult man chatting with an underage girl online and agreeing to meet up with her. An interesting concept with promise that could have gone in a number of different directions and been a really good film.But the route 'Hard Candy' goes down is one of torture, suffering and emotional manipulation. Despite the potential for a interesting plot, the film instead becomes nothing more than a back-to-back series of near-unwatchable torture scenes that nobody in their right mind could possibly get any enjoyment out of.Contrary to what others have said I thought 'Hard Candy' was unconvincing and poorly made - overwritten and overacted throughout, with scenes and scenarios that would never realistically happen in real life.

I personally flock to subjects like this....if I'm watching t.v. and I surf by Dateline's To Catch a Predator, I'm hooked for the hour.So when I heard about this, I had to check it out. The movie surprised me in tons of ways. I didn't think the movie would take it to the levels where it went. And I'm very thankful that it did. The acting in this movie was phenomenal....this is a type of film where you look at others and just laugh. The two lead stars were great, flat out. The movie had me on the fence about who's who and what's what. I was also surprised to find out that the suspense was at such a high level. Hard Candy was a flat out huge surprise. And definitely one of the best thrillers I've seen in a while.If I was to complain about anything, there are two things. Once or twice during the film I thought, this movie seems to be kind of long. But when the film ended I wanted to know and see more.....what a complaint huh? Another HUGE complaint takes place in the beginning of the movie where you have a scene of internet abuse taking place via Instant Messenger. The back and forth talk was incredibly fast and a little staged. (Sometimes you feel the same way with the dialogue later on in the movie.) But I can see that how this is just a set-up to make you understand what this movie is about. There is nothing really major to complain about.If you're into thrillers, movies that tackle stronger subjects, or just well done friggin movies, you should really enjoy this flick.

The two meet up at a coffee shop, Hayley suggests they go back to Jeff's house. The sweet, innocent young girl walking into the lion's den, you can guess what happens from there. Well no, actually you can't guess at all. This is a movie which defies your expectations. Things are not what they seem and best to not say much more than that to allow you to best enjoy the film.Unfortunately by the end you may find that you really didn't enjoy the film very much at all. Which is a shame because the movie has a lot to recommend it. The story is intriguing, although if you think about it afterward you can shoot many holes in it. The movie is undeniably well-acted. Patrick Wilson as Jeff and Ellen Page as Hayley are both excellent. Wilson and Page have to carry the whole film themselves, hold your attention throughout. They are up to the task. Much credit to them as this is certainly not the easiest material to perform, their characters go through the emotional wringer. But while the emotional drama is unrelenting for the characters the effect on the audience may not be quite the same. It's a movie billed as a thriller but the thrills prove to be in somewhat short supply.The movie sets up its rather intriguing, tension-filled scenario. But the tension slowly ebbs away, there's much talk about what is going to happen but things are not actually happening. It becomes somewhat monotonous. It's a movie with a lot of buildup and very little payoff. Having two characters who are, for wildly different reasons, hard to sympathize with is also an issue. Which, if either, are we supposed to feel for? An intriguing question raised by a very intriguing scenario. The story is fascinating, the performances are excellent but the whole thing just seems off somehow. The movie is by and large well-made, there's nothing obviously terrible about it. It has enough going for it that it seems like it should be a good movie but ultimately I was disappointed. I wish I liked it more than I did.",Hard Candy
77,MrGKB,Effectively disturbing but seriously flawed...,6,22 November 2008,"...""Hard Candy"" goes out of its way to polarize audience reaction to its role-reversal tale of vigilante ""justice,"" forcing the viewer to side with one psychopath or another, a decidedly unsettling experience. Judging by the comments here on the IMDb, it succeeded, even if its box office appeal was limited. This first feature from the creative team that went on to bring us ""30 Days of Night"" (another strikingly flawed film) relies on a manipulative script that raises more questions than it answers. The two leads, Ellen ""Juno"" Page and Patrick ""Lakeview Terrace"" Wilson, do what they can (which is happily a great deal) with their wildly improbable roles, but it's just not enough to salvage anything beyond water-cooler controversy.Basically, the concept is that a supposedly vulnerable, naive young girl turns the tables on a would-be sexual predator, revealing herself to be the more monstrous of the two. If there weren't so many ""oh, c'mons"" and ""hey, wait a minutes,"" this time-worn twist might have worked, but subtlety and credibility are not strong suits of Brian Nelson's pulpy screenplay. Page's vengeful angel fails to convince, while Wilson's captured demon equally fails to behave believably in the film's lurid dénouement. ""Hard Candy"" falters badly under the weight of its own pretensions. It's worth a watch for conversation generation, but don't expect any earthshaking revelations of the human condition. And don't think too hard about how a wisp of a teenage girl could manhandle an unconscious adult male into a standing position on a kitchen chair without strangling him in the process.Sensationalistic and ultimately disappointing, ""Hard Candy"" (which interestingly never explains its own title, though the Net-savvy will understand) pales compared to other Little Red Ridinghood tales like the infinitely superior ""Freeway.""",Hard Candy

Great stylized look to this film too. The acting and story is intense and you can't avert your eyes from the screen even though there are times where you think you might have to. I like movies that have the feel of a stage play and the emotional volleyball between the two principal actors is amazing. A little far-fetched but so what. This is a good movie. I give it a 8.5 out of a possible 10 and would recommend this film.,Hard Candy
79,educallejero,The PG-13 version of Spit on your Grave. Its good!,6,11 September 2018,"I watched this one because I read someone say ""if you really want an artistic revenge movie watch Hard Candy"".
And indeed, because it doesn't use graphic violence, they have to use different filmmaking techniques and A LOT OF SUGGESTION... to basically do the same thing.
So, this is as good as a movie for those that can't fathom the gruesome violence.
Oh and Patrick Wilson was already, 13 years ago a BEAST of an actor. The movie is really good, the cinematography is stellar, the dialogue is good and for the most part it feels natural. The violence its there, but again, not graphic, so it is probably easier to watch for some.But I don't get why this is considered so much better than other movies about rape and revenge. This movie is like the ""B side"" (or the ""A Side"") of the other types of movies. -While others use graphic violence, this one suggests it. 
-Both types of movies go over the top and unrealistic, only this one is more subtle.The only difference is that the characters are SLIGHTLY more nuanced in this movie. But just slightly. I give this movie a 6 (good), same as Spit on you Grave, while both use different ways to tell the same story without going more deep than that.",Hard Candy
80,vitaleralphlouis,Hard Candy is Pure Poison --- for Liberals,9,30 August 2009,"It looks like every one of the 1,928+ one-star voters was motivated to also write a review, many quite long. Perhaps some of these also wrote the numerous ""justification"" articles bleeding hearts for criminals; primarily during the 1960's and 1970's, the great liberal era of Time, Newsweek and other dribble. Before that era, pedophiles were well advised to not act on their impulses because retribution was swift and certain. Since then, armies of liberals will work ""pro bono"" to keep the child molesters both safe and active. They call it justice.Hard Candy takes a different view. A tight little thriller that turns the power struggle against the guilty -- and a small measure of pain (small in comparison to the heartless damage criminals do to underage girls) is inflicted by a smart teenage girl on a deserving criminal - one caught red-handed. Think about it: teens and children are often abused or killed in the stories on prime time TV, but when a movie shows bad things being done to a criminal, well shucks, that's SHOCKING! Hard Candy is well written, well directed, and with top flight performances and excellent camera work. There's some minor flaws in the plot, but 9 out of 10 is fair.",Hard Candy

Ellen Page is very good here playing an intelligent teenager to an almost faultless degree, even if she is better than the movie itself. There are a few flaws that at times took me out of the movie though one of them included how an unaided young woman of around 98 pounds could get an adult male into some of the situations featured.

83,fwomp,Think You've Seen The Best Psychological Thriller? Think Again...,10,28 September 2006,"Occasionally a piece of cinema pushes boundaries and hits its audience with issues pertaining to choice, judgement, and morality. These are the type of films that divide audiences and add heated comments to after dinner discussions. One such film in recent memory was THE WOODSMAN, starring Kevin Bacon, a story about a pedofile trying to integrate himself back into normal society after being released from prison. It pushed us beyond our normal comfort level and forced us to view the world in a somewhat more empathetic manner regarding these people (a pretty uncomfortable thing to even think about). And HARD CANDY asks the viewer similar disturbing questions but ping-pongs us back and forth between doubt and certainty about what's happening between the two main characters..The story opens with two people in a chat room on the internet, typing suggestive comments to each other. A face-to-face meeting is arranged and when the two come together, it is obvious there are issues here: one is a fourteen-year-old girl named Haley and the other is a 32-year-old photographer named Jeff. From the get-go we're uncomfortable with this meeting, as we know that men in Jeff's age-range shouldn't be meddling with a kid. The ante is upped even higher as Haley agrees to go home with Jeff (indeed, she pushes to go home with him). But once at Jeff's place, the tables rapidly turn. Haley is a smart and possibly psychotic young girl. As we delve deeper and deeper into the film, we begin to feel that maybe Jeff was setup somehow. And as Haley begins to knock Jeff down time and again, the audiences allegiances towards her stance are questioned. Should we be cheering for her? Or worried that Jeff may not be a pedofile after all and simply a nice guy? Time and again the tables get turned, and the viewer is constantly wondering which of these two they should be hoping comes out on top.This is one of the most intense films I've seen in a long time. Not since PSYCHO has this amount of a mental impact been felt. The beginning is somewhat slow to get going and many may feel like this is going to be a cliché-riddled movie. It isn't. As I sat on the couch, watching in horror as the stakes went higher and higher, my fiancé said, ""Honey? You're squeezing my hand too hard."" I hadn't realized how affected by the movie I'd become until she mentioned this. In fact, several times I held my breath, something that is a cliché in itself, but something I couldn't help.The acting and script for Hard Candy are absolutely superlative. Young Ellen Page (who was eighteen at the time but fits well into the role of a fourteen-year-old) delivers the performance of a lifetime. Her intensity, especially during a set of scenes I like to call ""The Home Surgery Mutilation"" is so creepy, frightening, and sick, that I actually felt nauseous. Patrick Wilson as Jeff is equally impressive and at felt equally repulsed and worried for him as the minutes ticked by.But don't be mistaken. The movie isn't forcefully bloody or grotesque. Its success is owed solely to the interactions of the characters and not what they do to each other. Men, be forewarned, you may have nightmares when you're done watching it.When the flick was over, I felt spent, as if I'd just ran a set of mental hurdles. That's how good this film is.",Hard Candy
84,rzajac,"My message board comment; ""Hard Candy"" unrealistic?",9,3 November 2008,"I get the impression that Hard Candy is taking lumps for its ""unrealism."" This is my take on this issue (slightly edited), from the message boards:A poster sez: ""I think her character was completely unrealistically written..."" The whole point with a movie like this, with an unquestionably unrealistic premise, is that it's toying with upping the ante and ""going mythic."" There are lots of people who are quite aware that the Christian mythology--that Christ died to ""pay for"" people's ""sins""--is completely unrealistic. And it is; it's totally unrealistic. The question is in the quality of the myth: Does or does not the core of the Christ story paint a mythic portrait of redemption? And Hard Candy invites us to do some of the same kind of mythic exploration.Now some obviously feel ""Hard Candy"" fails in its bid to go mythic; otherwise everyone would be raving about it being a rare movie indeed. Few movies achieve this and make a significant impact and (at least) sell tickets and (at best) become modern classics.I feel Hard Candy deserves a hearty congrats for trying to create a strange, new uberfeminist Zorro. I thought the film was like a particularly engaging comic book in this sense. Hard Candy feels like an earnest and laudable effort to create something a little more durable and morally down-to-earth than a lot of this pulp hero-mongering.Add in the direction and downright athletic dramatic work, and it's darned impressive, in my book.",Hard Candy
85,Falconeer,A poor attempt to be controversial...,3,10 January 2007,"After seeing so many ""controversial"" films made outside of Hollywood, this attempt at shock cinema comes across as flat, and somewhat uninteresting. Remember all the ""home invasion"" trash that Hollywood was spewing out in the late 80's into the 90's? Films like ""Fatal Attraction"", ""Hand That Rocks the Cradle"", ""Single White Female"", etc. These were all entertaining, and fun to watch once. But they are not considered 'great cinema'. The controversial topic of pedophilia is used here in an exploitative way to mask the fact that ""Hard candy"" is just another trashy 'home invasion' type film, only without the artistic style that some of those other films had. A teenage girl manipulates a man in his 30's into trusting her and inviting her into his home, where she can turn the tables on him, a guy who Hayley suspects is a child molester. Jeff, the man, played by Patrick Wilson takes a drink offered to him by Hayley, (Ellen Page). Of course the drink is drugged, and Jeff wakes up tied to a chair. Original, huh?Thus begins a series of very predictable cat and mouse games, involving scenario after tired scenario of events that we have seen played out many times before. A big problem with this film is that we can't care about any of these people; Jeff is a creepy, but boring ""photographer"", who likes to photograph young girls, and talk to them on the internet. He has no problem with taking home a girl Hayley's age and giving her alcohol, and letting her disrobe for a sleazy 'photo shoot.' Will Hayley kill this creep, or castrate him? Who really cares? And although Hayley is a teenager, she is way, WAY too tough and too smart to ever become a victim of a sexual predator. In fact she is more informed on the subject of predators and perverts than most adults. Also she is extremely jaded, cold, and calculating to ever elicit sympathy from the viewer. In fact, she was horrible. If she found herself in contact with a possible child molester, than she should have simply called the police. But if she had done that than this stupid movie could not have been made. Truthfully, this 'little girl' has so horrid that by the end of the film I was hoping that Jeff would break free from his restraints and give her a good beating! ""Hard Candy"" depends far too much on it's 'shocking' subject matter to get attention. So much so, that it seems that little thought was put into the actual making of this film. Especially considering the fact that it is not shocking at all. Hollywood has a way of watering down these taboo subjects to make the material suitable for mainstream consumption. From beginning to end, it is poorly and unimaginatively shot. Most of the film takes place in a very bland house. It features not one single frame of creative or artistic camera work or editing in it's entire running time. Ellen Page, although a competent actress, became less believable as the angry, vengeful teenager, as the film went on. And the character Jeff didn't come across as a particularly 'bad guy', or a 'good guy' for that matter. When a film features only two main characters for it's entire running time, than these characters need to be developed beyond the one-dimensional portrayals seen here. Some of the dialog was cringe-inducing, and the ending was pretty unbelievable. I think that the viewers that found this to be a good film, or a shocking film, have never ventured out of the 'mainstream'. They have never heard of directors like Augustin Villaronga, or even Gregg Araki. There are films that touch on similar subjects, in a way that make this Hollywood trash look like an absolute comedy in comparison. There is even a more accessible film, dealing with this 'vengeful Lolita' subject matter; A seldom seen little gem called ""Poison Ivy"", featuring Drew Barrymore as a young vixen who uses her seductive nature to destroy a dysfunctional family. It might be a bit trashy, but it is quite atmospheric, and beautiful to look at. At least that film doesn't pretend to be something other than what it is, and ""Poison Ivy"" actually gives more insight into the mind of a teenager who has some mental problems that are manifested through her overt sexuality. But the character of 'Ivy' is somehow sympathetic, and easier to understand, and to feel something for. Hayley from 'Hard Candy' is as cold and unfeeling as the movie itself. It might sound inappropriate to compare an 'exploitation-type' film like ""Poison Ivy"" with ""Hard Candy"", but actually ""Hard Candy"" is a trash film, masquerading as a more legitimate work. Do not be fooled by the sleek production values here; the film is exploitation, little more. 'Hard Candy' is strictly 'by-the numbers' thriller material, trying to appear like ""an important issue"" film. It uses a touchy subject to attract viewers; Pedophelia. And that is exploitation. It worked with me. When I read about this one, I just had to see it. I regret wasting my time here. But this is a Hollywood film, so I should not have expected more. You shouldn't either.",Hard Candy
86,agmoldham,Would you meet someone from the web?,6,29 June 2006,"I have never been a big user of web chat rooms and have never met any cyber friend in real life. The web allows many people to be more confident and expressive than they would be in real life. It therefore is particularly attractive to teenagers who suffer from more anxieties than the rest of the population. This film studies what happens when a 30's man (Jeff) meets a 14 year old (Hayley) girl.There are virtually no other characters in the film apart from the two main characters. This allows the film to focus on the relationship between the two leads in an increasingly claustrophobic environment. The screenplay is good, the acting good and the direction is also on the mark. I personally found it difficult to empathise with either of the two characters and I found Hayley's character not very true to life.

88,itamarscomix,An interesting film - worth watching,7,19 December 2011,"Hard Candy is the kind of film I really wanted to like, because it's unique, unexpected and dares to challenge the viewer; but it's also too flawed to be a really great work. It certainly has a lot going for it: most of all beautiful minimalistic cinematography, and solid acting from the two leads (and, indeed, the only two relevant players), Ellen Page and Patrick Wilson.What makes Hard Candy truly unique, though, is the sense of ambiguous morality. It challenges the viewer's perception of the characters' morals and motivations, and subverts them several times over. Even by the end of the film, they're not sure which one - if any - to root for. It's an impressive feat when dealing with subject matter like pedophilia, which is so charged and so difficult to get a handle on.The film goes a bit too far in that direction, though. Rather than create two complex characters, that are both likable and despicable, both of them are perceived as completely unsympathetic. The viewer walks away from the movie with disturbing thoughts about their values and core beliefs, but without any real emotional connection or any thought whatsoever about the characters. Actually, while the film asks some fascinating underlying questions about morality and justice, on the surface it feels too much like an exploitation film, focusing on the violence and shock value rather than smart dialog - which is the one aspect in which it's severely lacking.I'd definitely recommend Hard Candy, but you should take it with a pinch of salt and be aware of its many flaws to be able to overlook them. It's bad storytelling, but a fascinating piece of cinema.",Hard Candy
89,jpschapira,No salvation,6,15 April 2008,"You will hear director David Slade saying that if you've done a film that's made people think about their actions and what the people surrounding them do, and if that's good or bad or it doesn't matter, you've done a good work; something that deserves to be seen. Those are not Slade's exact words, but it's the basis of an established way of approaching a project in the independent film industry. The question is: is it enough to sustain a whole movie? Sometimes it may be, but following the objective of 'making people think', there's a wide range of directions to take. With ""Hard Candy"", Slade and writer Brian Nelson take extreme measures and go deep inside the cybernetic encounters between people; between people with a notorious age difference; between a 14 year old teenager (the wonderful Ellen Page) and a thirty-something professional photographer (Patrick Wilson).These two characters decide one day to meet in person. They have something to drink and they talk for a while. It's an interesting talk; a real talk about intellectual and popular subjects. A talk where they feel each other up; they test each other in a way, because you may chat with a person for a long time but that doesn't mean you know everything about them. During that conversation, ""Hard Candy"" establishes a visual mood. The light is very strong, generating an environment almost like out of a dream. It's not a nice dream, though. Slade and his film-making team make sure that the viewer feels uncomfortable. It's difficult to explain, but it's very easy to sense; when the conversation mentioned finishes, we have the strange feeling that something bad is going to happen.We don't know what, exactly, and I'm not going to tell you what. What I will tell you though is that it's not what I personally expected: I didn't expect it from Brian Nelson's well crafted script, nor from Slade's stylish conception of a film (it's true that the film's visual style is more than impressive for an independent work).The director, the writer and the actors play a game, and a very extreme one as I said previously. Sadly, there's a point where the seriousness of the extreme is not taken seriously enough and all the players suffer the consequences. It's not that Ellen Page work isn't another 'masterclass', it's that she's betrayed by the repetition of a material that even Meryl Streep would have problems managing.

90,tonypeacock-1,Vigilante film with echoes of the Death Wish franchise,7,18 January 2020,"A teenager cum Charlie Bronson/Paul Kersey type vigilante gives a paedophile a taste of his own medicine in a low budget thriller from director David SladeThe film has a tiny cast and mainly concentrates on the story of Hayley Stark (Ellen Page) a 14 year old who acts with a vengeance of someone much older and 'photographer' Jeff Kohlver (Patrick Wilson) who meet on an internet chat room...Jeff and Hayley meet and that is where the story takes a sadistic turn. Not in the way you would expect.Featuring some pretty graphic scenes, the film is strictly adults only. Page plays Hayley much more advanced than a mere teenager.It is a gripping thriller, a film that deserved a more mainstream release rather than an indie film background by a novice director.I found this 2005 different to the mainstream and must say it was just as good as older vigilante films like the Death Wish franchise.",Hard Candy

92,kuarinofu,Exploitative trash you should avoid,1,29 July 2019,"This movie is about a supervillain who is a supposedly 14-year-old girl who mutilates flesh and drives people to suicide while acting like she doesn't even care. She is omnipresent and has planned everything way ahead. In the first half, they bait you into thinking that there is a big mystery and that the characters have real motivation. Like maybe this movie is a psychological thriller, and they are trying to make the viewer guess who's the real villain and who's the victim. But it turns out that everything is the other way around. No big twists, no real motivation. Just an hour and a half of this movie feeding on disgust and pure shock value. It's an excellent way to get you hooked though. But as it continues to feed on shock value, it gets tedious and weary. And when it finally forces you to fast forward all the pointless violence, the ending gives you the middle finger. I assume the director had a fun time laughing while filming the end the way he did. I laughed too but only because of how stupid and pointless it was.The movie has two major characters, and both of them are horribly written. Nothing that happens affects the main lead in any way. She is just a robot that mutilates and humiliates people while not showing any emotion. She's not a psycho since she's not enjoying it and she shows no compassion. She is so focused on driving one man to suicide, and she spends a lot of time and effort to do so. On the other hand, the male character is all over the place. He is somewhat believable at first, but by the end, he does whatever to drive the most stupid story I've ever experienced to the most unsatisfying and stupid ending. He acts like a victim that the killer will get first in a typical slasher film.The story is full of holes, but it evident that they didn't care. The girl is super strong and super intelligent. She can take down a grown man with her bare hands. She knows that he has a gun and she had already included the weapon in her plan. In fact, she knows everything that happened and will happen, so there's really no reason to interrogate him. Thus, the drug scene, the interrogation scene, and the safe combination scenes are pointless (while the chat thing is totally disconnected from anything else). Since she's super intelligent, she already knows that he has some evidence in his house but she never even needed them in the first place. She doesn't also subject him to pain since she doesn't care about that and doesn't want him to suffer. Obviously, nothing he says will change her mind, and she never doubts anything since her knowledge comes from the fabric of space itself. The whole  premise is abandoned right away, so the story about the hardships of the male's childhood makes no sense. Him appealing to her carrying this burden is also pointless since she doesn't feel anything, and it's evident. The film also has a random pointless neighbor scene that was only put into the movie because they thought there's not enough characters or something.I guess at some point they thought they were making a ""smart"" movie about trusting people over the Internet, but I can't see how a person older than 14 can find this smart.This movie is a waste of time that will try to lower your IQ so you can enjoy it as the creators did.",Hard Candy
93,oneloveall,Controversial premise immaturely explored,4,17 September 2006,"Poised to become one of the more controversial releases from last year, this overwrought pedophilia morality tale/revenge piece falls dangerously far from it's intended force of impact and ends up wallowing in the embarrassing exploitations of it's demise. While starting off promising, addressing the very pertinent and seldomly discussed topic of underage sexual predators, the movie quickly turns into a drawn out shock-fest, playing out like a naive feminist's wet dream, where tables are turned and morals are skewed, despite my disgruntled apathy towards the whole thing. Where there should have been relevance and true mental anguish, the filmmakers go for nothing but cheap and easy squirm factors, and in turn take away much potency from the message they wished to convey. Kudos to such a young actress (though far, far older then she is playing here) for taking on such a demanding role, but unfortunately this all dissolves pretty quickly into the caricature induced spectacle it really is. The overlong sequences become tediously embarrassing as it becomes more and more apparent this movie was made to get a rise out of it's viewers, rather then actually compel them to think realistically about it. I suppose the ""edgy"" fare will provide a squeamish night of frightful entertainment for the forward leaning crowd, but anyone old enough to realize the film provides far more exploitation then information will remain sadly underwhelmed.",Hard Candy
94,raymond-15,A stunning portrayal of vengeance,8,2 June 2007,"It seems that the world will never run out of new stories to tell, especially when new writers and new producers venture into new and dangerous areas. This film is truly stunning. It says much for the two main characters that they can hold you squirming in your seat for the best part of two hours. Only a good script and some good actors can do that.This film considers some very current problems about the immoral use of the internet, pedophilia and the consequences. When a 14 year old girl ( is she a little crazy?) wreaks vengeance on a 32 year old photographer for his past misdeeds on her girl friend, she sets out in a cold methodical way to make him suffer. Mental torture is a most horrible condition and she knows exactly how to apply it. What part of a man's body does he treasure most? She knows so well. With a kitchen knife in hand, she threatens to divest him of it. It's a terrifying moment in the film as she subjugates her victim. Tied down on a table, he screams for mercy "" Pleasepleaseplease!"" How she loves every moment of torment.The interesting part of the film is that it builds slowly. We learn this and that about the characters, a little at a time, until we think we have the full picture, but we are never certain. She does admit that she is a bit crazy and that she has had sessions with psychiatrists while he denies everything at first but later admits he did know her girlfriend. At the end of the film you are left in a quandary. Who is the guilty one? The only question I have about this amazing film is this. Would a 14 year old girl have the know-how and the physical strength to overcome a man and tie him down to a table?. If you accept this as possible, it is a perfect thriller, gripping to an extreme and the difficult subject matter so delicately handled. Even so some may find it offensive.",Hard Candy
95,Isaac5855,"Mesmerizing, disturbing, unsettling....",8,30 May 2008,"Definitely not for all tastes, but a riveting film experience for those who are game, HARD CANDY is a severely intense and claustrophobic two-character drama that will have you either riveted to your seat or running from the room. Ellen Page (JUNO)delivers a powerhouse performance as Hayley. a 14-year old girl who communicates online with a photographer (Patrick Wilson) a man she suspects is a pedophile, arranges to meet him in person, drugs him and plans to punish him for what appears to be his intended seduction of her by castrating him. The captor/captive interplay here recalls films like MISERY and EXTREMETIES but descends to an entirely unique level of ugliness due to the callously cavalier attitude of the captor and the hopeless desperation of the captive, whose complete powerlessness and panic is heartbreaking to watch. To reveal anymore of the story would just be wrong, but it should be noted that the film boasts solid direction and a smart screenplay, though the camera-work does get a bit dizzying at times. Page commands the screen in an Oscar-worthy performance that induces chills and hisses and is perfectly complimented by Wilson's emasculated victim. A one-of-kind motion picture experience that will leave you breathless and limp.",Hard Candy
96,DonFishies,An awkward masterpiece that needs to be seen by everyone,9,19 December 2006,"Originally, I was not going to see Hard Candy. I was not sure what it was about, but just by looking at the DVD box, it did not look like anything too amazing. But after hearing more and more about it, I found the need to track down a copy and see it. It took a bit of time, but after finally experiencing the film, I am both deeply disturbed and astonishingly impressed all at once, especially thinking about it weeks after seeing it.As sad as it makes me, I think everyone who has seen the movie has revealed far too much about it. Indeed, a revealing synopsis was what really made me desire to see the film, but really disheartens me because it gives so much away about it. But basically, the film revolves centrally around two characters: Jeff (Patrick Wilson), a photographer in his early 30's, and Hayley (Ellen Page), a 14-year-old honours student. The film opens with an Internet chat conversation between these two characters, and over the course of the brief chat (or at least, of what the audience can read), they decide to meet up at a local coffee bar. They meet, talk for a bit, and then proceed over to his house.Yes, those who know a lot about the film, or just from the brief description understand that nothing good could possibly come from this chance meeting.What proceeds is probably the most disturbing film to come from just about anywhere in the last few years. And with it comes the notion that this film could have only been made as an Indie. This is not the stuff Hollywood usually is known to mass-produce; it is actually pretty far from it. Thankfully, being on the verve actually works and makes this intense film all the better. It is both at once thought provoking and genuinely twisted. The enormously disgusting nature of the film will induce you into wanting to vomit, but at the same time, makes you never want to look away. Its burning desire to make you keep watching becomes so forceful and provocative that the film almost becomes pornographic by default. As the film progresses and it probes deeper into what is acceptable and what is not, the film just hits a powerful nerve, and it never lets go.This immense strength comes exclusively from Wilson and Page. There are other actors in the film, but they only get a few minutes in the limelight. These two are front and centre for the entire production, and they play off each other brilliantly. Being newer actors, I thought they would not do so well (Page was not all that amazing in X-Men: The Last Stand, and I have yet to see Little Children to pass judgment on Wilson), but their work here is enough of a qualification for being a great actor. They just mesh together so well, and their emotions are so in tune with each other. They just know these characters and their relationship to each other so thoroughly that their ""chemistry"" (wrong word, but proper context) is better than the performances from the majority of mainstream actors. Yes, you can tell that they are not completely in tune with these characters at all moments, but for most of the film, you would be hard set not thinking this was something really happening somewhere in the world.The two are both at once disturbed and naïve. They do not know what they want, but their twisted journey just becomes more inept as it goes along. Wilson and Page are both able to express this well on screen, and in one way, do not appear to have such a huge age gap between them. But watching scenes such as the opening dialogue exchange at the coffee bar, it does quickly become obvious that the two are very far off from each other. But it works on so many levels because of the maturity of both actors, and the maturity of the script itself. It wants to be taken seriously, and it does not want to be brushed away. The scenes between these two character work on so many levels because of how hard everyone is working to make them believable. And they all are, even the moments of sheer fantasy. While they do work together greatly, another dose of strength for the film are the visuals. The photography that is used to bring this sick and twisted masterpiece to life are just a marvel to watch. At times, the colours are brightly lit, and are happy. And at others, they are dark, drab and downright evil. This helps continue the notion of just how awkward and disturbing the film wants to be. Having carefully selected the colour of Hayley's sweater is a bit of a casual metaphor for a classic fairy tale, and it works magnificently in place here although it is only shown a few times (but more prominently on the film's cover).The film is inherently controversial, and it does not attempt to make itself out to be anything different. It revels in its content and material, and through the cinematic format, paints a haunting and visceral picture that not everyone will be able to understand, and most people would never be able to watch. It makes you rethink the reality of the world, and really brings about the idea of whether or not the film is plausible. Yes, it is very fantastical, but it is grounded in reality unlike much of the mainstream fare. It is not perfect film, but it is one that needs to be seen. It may be disturbing and may question where you should sympathize, but this awkward masterpiece has two of the best performances you are bound to ever see.9/10.",Hard Candy
97,moviesleuth2,A tense psychological game of cat and mouse,7,25 June 2008,"Here is a film that dares to push the boundaries. Many films revolve around a game of cat and mouse, but because this movie dares to go where few would even think of going, it allows room to break other taboos, and thus make for more unexpected and surprising twists.The plot is merely a set-up for a lot of interesting and thrilling twists. A young girl named Hayley (Ellen Page) is lured to the home of a photographer named Jeff (Patrick Wilson). But nothing is what it seems.Even though that the film really goes where no film has gone before, the film would not have been as interesting had it not been for two solid performances. Without giving anything away, I can't go into any detail, but I will say that the acting is great. Apart from a few token walk-ons, the only real cast is Ellen Page and Patrick Wilson. Both are terrific, but Ellen Page is better, and at times this kind of upsets the balance a little.Brian Nelson has a lot of guts. Not only does he make a psychological thriller revolving around a touchy subject, he's smart enough to realize that he's already gone far enough over the edge that he doesn't need to insert ""safe"" and ""wholesome"" twists into the script. Even better is that the script is intelligent and the dialogue is electric. He takes advantage of the freedom he has given himself by throwing twists at us that venture into similarly uncharted territory that other writers either haven't thought of or won't touch. Also, it's nice to see someone who doesn't rely on the director's ability for misdirection to do service to their script, he has the skill to provide the twists himself, and none of them are predictable (at least at first). It's refreshing to watch characters who do things we the viewer don't expect, and aren't dumb as a brick.Director David Slade does great service to Nelson's script. The desaturated color, the controlled jerkiness of the camera, the changing speed, and the blackouts after key scenes enhance the atmosphere and give rise to the tension. Slade is one to watch, and I eagerly anticipate his future work.""Hard Candy"" is not perfect. The acting between the two leads is not exactly even, but it's good enough. Also, the film leaves some questions at the end that should be answered.This is not a ""Fatal Attraction"" rip-off. It may seem similar, but it goes down a different track. Still, it's a good little thriller, though not for the faint of heart.",Hard Candy
98,rajdoctor,Hard candy,5,21 March 2008,"Two characters and psychological thriller, was that pinned me down to notice and be eager to see this movie.The story is about a 32 year old photographer Jeff Kohlver (Patrick Wilson) who befriends a 14 year old girl Hayley Stark (Ellen Page) through internet chat. They meet in a coffee shop, and from there end up in Jeff's home in the outstriks of California. From here the psychothriller starts, between Hayley the avenger and Jeff the accused pedeophile. Hayley's purpose is to castrat Jeff. After much tilting balances in the psycho drama  it becomes clear that Jeff must have been a pedeophile, but even more strakling fact that we face is that Hayley is a much more psychotic evil. I won't tell you the ending to break spoilers.This is the first movie of Director David Slade and I should say that he has chosen a hard hitting subject and presented an obscure extreme case scenario that surely engages audiences. The camera work, sets and dialogue fit very well with the intention. But where David fails is in showing maturity as genius masters. He pushes the characters over the edge and makes them talk continuously, and looses the medium's art where silences play much more psychotic horror role on audience's mind. He looses the battle there and there.Patrick Wilson plays the good looking accused pedeophile with ease. But the movie stands watchable on the over-acting by Ellen Page. This is the second movie I have seen of hers, first being Juno (released in 2008). I had commented on her that she is too over-confident on the role and tends to over-act in every department of acting, be it her finch of eyes or body language or tone. She does what the directors intends  but I think she looses subtlety of matured actors. I have seen many youngsters start their acting careers like this, and slowly evolve to become good actors and actresses. I am sure Ellen Page would one day succeed in that  only if she does not get type  casted in this type of over zealous roles.I think the castrating scene is really chilling for every man in the audience. The movie is able to drive the point on man that intention of flirtatious pedeophile may end up being punished so miserably. Hope that helps change things.But the biggest surprise for me and worry (as I have stated in many other writings of mine) is a pushing of feminine characters to be as brutal, mean and evil as man, and projecting them as role models to our society. I worry about the fact that were the society is moving? Rather than bringing man back to tender feminity, the man of the world are in a rat race to present women as men's evil doers.Back to the movie, there are too big plot holes  that remain hidden while viewing but at the end of the movie when the audience realizes them, it does not leave a highly satisfactory rating.(Stars 5 out of 10)",Hard Candy

Every aspect of this was thoughtfully crafted to make a scary movie and a dramatic suspense movie.This was a pleasure to watch and within the first 1/2 hour, I was just blown away by the writing.Sweet job with the dialog for Hayley...cleverly composed.Good structure for the story setup and ending...a nice change from the routine pshyco killers and horror movies.This is talent in all capacity.It's not one of my favorite movies and never will be, but this shows real skill and with more writers telling a story of this caliber, maybe movies will eventually change for the better.A little slow at times but kept me interested to the very end.",Hard Candy
100,LazySod,Hard Candy breaks minds as hard candy breaks teeth,9,24 October 2006,"Most films do best if you know next to nothing about them. This is one of them. The poster shows a young girl standing in an over-sized bear trap. And the only further information I had on it was that the film was about a 14 year old girl suspecting a guy she meets on the net to be a pedophile wants to bring said guy down. The combination of the two (the symbolism on the poster and the text) triggered my curiosity and I sat down to watch the film.The film starts with a scene all too familiar these days: two people chatting over the internet using one or the other instant messenger service. The topic: a face to face meeting of the two. When the two meet the age difference becomes horribly clear: a 14 year old girl and a 32 year old guy. From there it rolls on.I love minimalist films. I love films about the darker topics. I love films about mental battles between people. This film combines the three of these and so I love this film. It is gruesome, sick and twisted in more ways than just the pedophile. It is also cut in a way that takes people straight into the characters, there's no avoiding them.The two lead characters, and actually just about the only two characters for all the others combined playtime is measured in a couple minutes, play each other so well the scene might be reality. The confrontation between the two is different from standard: it is hard to feel any form of sympathy for either character. For me the choice was made pretty early to sympathize with the lesser evil, the girl and that worked out very well.Hard candy.

A person goes out looking for one thing and gets something entirely else. Of of us exploit the weaknesses and ignorances of other people in a way wholly advantageous to us at what point does that exploitation become criminal?

102,MichaelMargetis,One of the Most Frightening Films I've Ever Seen,8,21 November 2007,"Hayley Stark: Nothing's yours when you invite a teenager into your home. Creepy isn't the word. Terrifying best sums up David Slade's first feature film about two individuals who chat online who decide to meet up for coffee one day. Hayley is a 14-year-old girl who is ""mature"" for her age. Jeff is a 30-something year old professional photographer who likes underage girls. What starts out as an easy score for Jeff when he gets Hayley back to his place, quickly turns into the most horrifying ordeal of his life when the tables are turned and Jeff ends up tied up at the torturous hands of Hayley. The movie then becomes a big suspenseful romp, and you are constantly cringing and asking the dreaded question, ""What the F__CK is gonna happen next?!""The cast basically consists of two people, Jeff and Hayley. Patrick Wilson whom you may know from Little Children, Phantom of the Opera and the celebrated HBO miniseries Angels in America, is subtle yet brilliant as the smooth-talking alleged pedophile Jeff. Ellen Page on the other hand steals the film with her surprisingly riveting performance as a very disturbed and vengeful little girl. Needles to say, this is a step-up from Page's last role as a mutant superhero in X-Men 3. Brian Nelson's writing is smart and David Slade's directing is impressive for a first-time filmmaker. The only thing to not like about this film is the very slow-moving initial 20 minutes. After that it's non-stop on-the-edge of your seat kinda cinema. 'Hard Candy' doesn't have any graphic violence or gore to scare it's audience, just pure old fashioned psychological terror.

105,Flagrant-Baronessa,Tony Scott called and he wants his cinematography back,6,14 October 2006,"Precious few films open such a strong note as 'Hard Candy'. Words on a screen. A messenger of sorts. A 14-year-old girl is talking to a 32-year-old man, they flirt, and they decide to meet in a public place. When they hook up, it is a segment so harrowing and wrist-slashingly uncomfortable that it still stays with me. The looks, the awkward dialogue, the 32-year-old man with a quiet, calculating lethality about him; it all invests the film in an extremely uncomfortable atmosphere. The acting is fantastically crisp and layered and Ellen Page has a refreshing emotional transparency about her. When Jeff (that's the creepy man) shows Hayley (that's the little nymphet) his car, she is impressed. They head back to his place  a stylish, bachelor-pad that oozes affluence. Together they chat, drink, listen to music and exchange looks all the while maintaining a degree of creepiness. The twist is deftly wielded in the beginning of the story as Hayley turns from victim to predator in an elaborate attempt to expose Jeff as a pedophile. Disturbingly enough, she seems to enjoy it.Everything up to this point is golden; its opening scene is its goldmine. Then 'Hard Candy' completely falls apart, falling prey to 'style over substance' in its dizzying, choppy, intimate camera-work (did they kidnap Tony Scott's cinematographer?) and far worse, Ellen Page  who was so promising in the beginning  fatally tips over into overacting territory and loses her authenticity. Jeff is no longer a threatening character when you remove his glasses, strip him off that tense posture and strap him down to a chair. He becomes humaneven humane, while Hayley becomes increasingly annoying. In the end, you hold a fine line between sympathy and disgust for her character.The aforementioned is undoubtedly all strategically placed in the film. It wants us to question whom is right and whom is wrong and to what extent you can go to expose someone. Yet this whole process becomes frightfully exhausting to watch, the acting becomes unbearable and neither of the characters truly interest you. It is talkative but without clear insight coming through its dialogue. It becomes an endless charade of torture and mind games that I believe only ever generated buzz because of its timely subject matter  internet pedophilia.6 out of 10",Hard Candy

It creates a level of suspense that is completely unparalleled. The entire buildup to the castration scene kept me on the edge of my seat and was shockingly more suspenseful than anything Hitchcock could conjure up. The final twist was completely unexpected and the entire final scene simply blew my mind. The performances are also quite sensational. Both Wilson and Page deliver some of the best work of the year, including Page who delivers the absolute greatest performance of the year.

It does mean that the film is very well made, but it definitely cuts down on rewatchability, as I doubt I'll see it again. Once the action picks up, it's easier to watch, at least until the infamous surgery. The end is a big letdown, though. The theory about Hayley being imagined would work well (and would make the film better), if not for the neighbour scene, which really adds nothing to the film, except, I suppose, to show that she does exist.

Talking together at a coffee shop, Hayley suggests they go back to Jeff's home. After a few drinks and photographing Hayley, Jeff passes out, only to awaken to a cat and mouse game Hayley has set.Hard Candy is one intense, psychological thriller. From the opening scene of the friendly banter between Hayley and Jeff, your instantly uncomfortable. You feel for the her, constantly thinking why is she so stupid and how did she fall into this. The moment they finally meet and Jeff first enters, you feel hateful, his presence is unnerving. Yet from clever plot devices from writer Brian Nelson, the twist comes and nothing is what it seems. Hayley has a hidden agenda to play with Jeff; she isn't walking into a trap, she's walking right into the wolf's den to trap him.Director David Slade has created a highly crafted thriller. With amazing cinematography by Jo Willems, Slade has utilised extreme close ups, constricting our vision, creating extreme discomfort and claustrophobia. We never really get much sense of our surroundings. Much like Rolf De Heer's brilliant film Alexandra's Project, once you enter the house, there is no leaving. The intensity never drops, only building upon itself to excruciating levels. The center piece of Hard Candy is the most painful and jaw clenching time spent in a film.Arcetypes of the hero and villain are smashed and blur the lines. While starting off with the archetypes firmly stamped into the characters, the beginning of Hayley's game spin them on their head, with Jeff evoking so much sympathy, you feel for his situation, while constantly reminded he is not a redeemable person. Hayley switches between victim to hero to anti hero, she becomes so vulgar and disdained, it's hard to follow her cause. You feel pity and repulsion for both characters.Recent films to tackle the hard and controversial subject matter of pedophilia; Mysterious Skin and The Woodsman have dealt with the after math of victims to this crime. Hard Candy takes you to the ordeal, the beginning banter between the two people in the chat room, them meeting in public, adding to the harsh reality this happens.With the film based upon two people in a house, there isn't much interaction between other people; Sandra Oh, Jennifer Holmes and Gilbert John barely have any screen presence with such minimal screen time, yet they aren't the focus. Patrick Wilson delivers a powerhouse performance as Jeff. He pushed your emotions with his character, you feel so much sympathy for him and his ordeal. Though it's Ellen Page that is just blistering as Hayley. She does such an amazing performance for a young actress, flipping between her hero/anti hero so smoothly, it's shocking seeing her transform from naive child to icy cold extremist.Hard Candy is one film you wont easily forget.",Hard Candy
111,alainenglish,"Intense, controversial drama",9,3 March 2008,"A now very well-known and controversial independent film, ""Hard Candy"" effectively made Ellen Page a name player in Hollywood, setting the catalyst for her Oscar nom in ""Juno"". She powers this movie very well and delivers a moving, but terrifying performance in the central role.The plot is genius simplicity. A young teenage girl Hayley (Page) agrees to meet a man she has met online, a photographer named Jeff (Patrick Wilson). Hayley agrees to let Jeff take her back to his house for a photoshoot but the photographer finds himself drugged and then tied to a chair, as Hayley interrogates him over the disappearance of a young girl...The beauty of the script lies in it's many unanswered questions. Is Jeff really the man Hayley is after and if so, is he the only one involved the disappearance of the girl? Even more disturbing is the question of Hayley's actual identity. Who is she, where does she come from and what is her ultimate agenda? The plot combines this with a suspenseful plot as the pair battle it out for power and control.Patrick Wilson is excellent as Jeff. Although his character is physically sidelined for much of the film, Wilson does his best to create a compelling and believable pervert. He can't quite the make the character sympathetic, however. The audience can easily side with Hayley (especially after a scene where she uncovers some horrifying photographs of his). Although Hayley subjects him to considerable physical and psychological punishment, I did not at any time feel sympathy with him. The famous scene where Hayley castrates Jeff (or does she?) got laughs from the audience I viewed it with, who clearly delighted in the humiliation of a deviant, however fictional.As the film's anti-heroine, Page creates a believable character in Hayley without becoming sentimental or giving too much away. The power of this character is her mystery. Wherever Hayley is coming from, it's not a pretty place and Page makes the character sympathetic without once losing her edge. The closing scene on the rooftop of Jeff's apartment provides a fitting, ambiguous end to proceedings.Although some may question the morality of using this kind of subject matter as material for entertainment, ""Hard Candy"" deserves credit for taking the point of the view of the victims of such crimes in much the same way ""The Accused"" (which explored the point-of-view of a rape victim) did twenty years earlier.It's not always easy to watch, but ""Hard Candy"" still deserves to be seen.",Hard Candy
112,Scars_Remain,Very Disturbing,9,23 August 2008,"It's hard to know what exactly to rate this film because the entire time I was watching it, I was so disturbed and uncomfortable but at the same time, I was amazed at how well done this film was. I'll settle for a near perfect rating. It's just about that good. I've seen quite a few shock, or disturbing films, and while this may not be the most disturbing thing I've seen, it certainly is up there.A very intriguing and intense storyline is really what made this movie great. The acting is probably second but Ellen Page bugged the heck out of me as usual. She wasn't bad, but she's always so pretentious and as a result, seems to over act. Patrick Wilson saved the acting aspect for me and is much better than Page. I loved everything else in this movie.Check this movie out for an intense time. It will disturb and haunt you, but it will be worth it!",Hard Candy
113,Danny_G13,Dark thriller/horror with one massive flaw,8,19 August 2006,"Claustrophobic story of girl's capture of an alleged paedophile makes one massive mistake, but is otherwise extremely well acted.This is hard to watch at times, make no bones about it.It's the tale of how a 14 year old girl meets a significantly older photographer online and ensnares him at his home, believing him to be a paedophile who has targetted other young girls and killed at least one.Ellen Page is Hayley, the young girl determined to punish the man she is convinced is a paedophile, and Patrick Wilson is Jeff, the man who suffers at the hand of her hostaging.This movie is dark; hell, what story about paedophilia wouldn't be, and the acting is nothing short of excellent. Both characters are extremely convincing and both shock in their respective ways.As such, and given its hugely psychological horror approach where the terror is left mostly to the imagination and is realised by the acting, the quality of the movie *is* high.The biggest flaw though is that I'm not sure exactly who the makers wanted us to root for, because the girl is portrayed as mildly unhinged and explicitly psychotic, while the alleged paedophile comes across as the victim who frankly we want to side with. Surely if he's the bad guy, we want the girl to succeed and to truly torment him.Maybe this is the point; maybe the movie is telling us paedophiles are people like you and I, only they are mentally ill as a schizophrenic would be and cannot be judged accordingly. Maybe we're to sympathise with the notion of anyone suffering, and no matter what they are supposed to have done, we cannot condone someone taking the law into their own hands and punishing them vigilante style.I dunno - I'm just not sure what message was being put across, and that is slightly concerning.However, overlooking this is the simple fact that for the performances alone and the quality of the considered direction, this is a fine piece of cinema, but certainly isn't one what would describe as a date movie.One to watch out for.",Hard Candy
114,Cinema_Fan,"Candy is dandy, but this will ruin more than your teeth.",4,4 October 2006,"Hard Candy, like the play Waiting for Godot, in principle only, is a play of two characters, and two characters only, this is a play concerning duel personalities with one major theme in mind; paedophilia.With its hidden twists and turns Hard Candy is angel cake with the added ingredient of bitter pills that is certainly best served cold, this play, of responsible indifference, is a chilling insight of the effects and counter effects of this atrocious crime.The bait is laid, the trap is set and the consequence of our actions is the bed that we inevitably must lie in. There is no escaping the legalities that subversion brings, Hard Candy is that justification. David Slade, with his first major feature film here, and a gallant effort too, has delivered Ellen Page, born February 1987, into our grasp. She just about taunts us with interest, with her character Hayley Stark, but this meandering quickly becomes repetitive and a tad too perplexing in places to warrant any believability in the long run, in retrospect of the David and Goliath scenario that transforms into The Mouse That Roared. Though rather on the slow side to begin with, Hard Candy soon gradually delivers momentum, and while we are at pains for this young girl's welfare, we are driven to the precarious world of the Internet chat rooms. This particular social message that should have alarm bells ringing for all that casually type away with abandonment is a stark reminder that even being incognito will not protect, unless, of course, the proper procedures of caution are being observed. This is where Hard Candy falls into place, the care free, naive and gullible actions of the unwary, of the hard candy, the slang term for an underage girl, that will have, for some, dire consequences.Hard Candy is an enquired taste, for some the pace will be too slow, for others this is how it should be delivered, in a non rushed manner that has both victim and victimiser bonding, for the wrong reasons, and unsuspecting of what is to be their overall fate. When this fate is finally approached, we are grateful that the final curtain of this play has drawn to a close and that the show is finally over, not for indifference, but to be witness of the justice being executed.",Hard Candy
115,inframan,Sophomoric Drivel,1,7 June 2013,"It's interesting how many people review this film as though it were a documentary of an actual occurrence. As has been stated in other reviews, the setup is fairly arbitrary, no actual evidence is ever given about the guy's actual guilt & it's all basically about setting him up as a straw man for his eventual demolition. Pretty simple-minded pedantic stuff.As a film, it's pathetic. Stagy action, stiff acting, very dull uninsightful writing. The principals seem like 2 fairly competent students in an acting class going through an exercise, one that should have been critiqued & hugely improved before committing to film. But then what did the actors have to work with? Not much. A bland generic early-30s ""pedophile"" who ""preys"" on a twisted teen played by a cute slightly under-age looking 18 year old?If anything this is a piece of ""hard candy"" for closet pedophiles who get off on sadistic teenies ala Kick-Ass.",Hard Candy
116,PeterRoeder,Pointless,4,31 January 2007,"This seemed like an interesting story but it is made in such a poor way that it spoils everything. first of all, there is absolutely no justification for the so-called young woman's actions. only thing that would have made sense is if she had indeed been a supernatural being such as a ghost. but making her into this justice-freedom-fighter against pedophiles is just ridiculous. It doesn't matter what Jeff, who seems like a nice guy, by the way, has done, and this sort of behaviour would be impossible by a 14 year old girl. both physically and mentally. as usual us horror is trying to emulate Japanese recent horror but fails miserably. This movie hard candy looked like a haunting story but all ready about half an hour into the movie i could see that none of the actors or people involved in this movie was up to the task.

Creepy Internet chat leads to a clandestine coffeeshop hookup between 32-year-old Jeff and 14-year-old Hayley. The two predictably end up in Jeff's house but the story turns on its ear from that point and never looks back. The constant use of ultra-extreme close-ups and what screenwriter Brian Nelson describes as Slades ""..ability to make color a character in everything he shoots"" gives this psychological thriller tremendous momentum and gobsmack intensity. Hard Candy does impose the hypocrisy of American conservative morality on its audience.

118,CelluloidRehab,They never showed this on Dateline.,6,21 November 2006,"The plot is simple enough. A 30 something photographer, a.k.a. Jeff, meets an underage androgynous robot, a.k.a. Hayley, (after the movie it goes on to play an X-Men) over the internet. They meet over coffee and she/it suggests that they reconvene at his place. Yada, yada, yada .... Dateline shows up and reads their chat room conversations in a stoic and morose manner. Or better yet, it turns out the AI robot is actually an undercover member or law enforcement who arrests him on the spot. No I'm just kidding. In the movie, the roles of victim/assailant are thrown up in the air. We are torn. Who is right in this scenario ? You find yourself swaying depending on what we see and what we hear.I definitely had mixed feelings about this movie. During the first 60-65 minutes of the movie I was cursing myself for picking yet another dud. The movie gets a little better down the stretch, probably due to the increase of actual violence and decrease in supposedly intelligent ""dialog"" (not to mention the interesting ""Wicked""-like ending). I have always disliked dialog that seems intelligent at first, except if force fed to the actors (especially done in a lot of indy movies). Usually this is due to a bad combination of dialog and casting. Unfortunately, I found myself either shaking my head at the juvenile nature of the dialog or the sudden switch to calculated Orwellian-like dialog. For an example of this, check out the one-dimensional Nicolas Cage in American Treasure where his ""revelations"" suddenly appear in his mind, as if someone just spoke the line to him through an earpiece. Another problem with this movie comes from the fact that if you have probably heard of the movie, you also know the synopsis. It's also right there on the back of the box. Without the element of surprise, this movie loses most of its bite. Also, unless you have been under a rock or do not like Asian cinema you have seen this before in any of Chan-wook Park's Vengeance trilogy or Takashii Miike's Audition. By those standards, this movie is tame.In the end, you find out very little except what we already suspected initially. So the whole movie turns into a giant vigilante retribution session, except the involvement of the ""child"" robot is still somewhat in doubt. Was this an experiment, an initiation, the loss of innocence, justice or a prank? Is she a victim, a vigilante, a criminal or a relative? Who knows. Only Grandma, the Woodsman and the big bad Wolf know.Definitely see this movie before any of the movies I mentioned earlier, otherwise you might be a little disappointed or have a sense of deja vu. The uncut (sorry for the pun) version of this movie (if it exists) should be required punishment for sexual predators, pedophiles, rapists, domestic abusers, female castrators and so forth. They should be strapped in and forced to watch (much like Alex De Large).",Hard Candy
119,brenttraft,"Excellent But Difficult ""Candy""",9,29 April 2006,"""Hard Candy"" is one of the best films this year. It has a really good script, dialog, photography, and acting.My difficulty in recommending this film has to do with it's subject matter. Child molestation is a serious subject and anyone who has been molested or knows someone who has molested might be seriously offended by this film. Parts of the film are humorous, although this is not a humorous subject. This is a game of cat and mouse, which turns into an ""Ichy and Scratchy"" cartoon. (If you don't watch The Simpsons, that means it is violent.)If you go into this film prepared for what is going to happen, this is a great film. It has the best dialog of any film this year and has real creative use of camera angles. The acting is among the best all year.""Hard Candy"" is basically a two person play. Almost the entire film takes place in one room. It starts out kind of fun, then gets pretty scary and unpleasant. It's an exhausting film and definitely is not for everyone.",Hard Candy
120,come2whereimfrom,David and Goliath.,7,18 June 2006,"The premise of this film is a cat and mouse game and what happens when the weak becomes the strong when the hunter becomes the hunted, a real David and Goliath tale. Opening with a computer screen containing on-line chat room banter we see two people arrange a meeting. What happens from the moment they meet is the crux of this cautionary tale as he is a thirty two year old photographer and she a fourteen-year-old schoolgirl. As we progress through the plot it seems that he has groomed other young girls on the net and is about to do the same here with Hayley that is until she turns the table on him. Jeff begins the film all suave and casual and slowly unravels as Hayley wreaks her vengeance upon him. What isn't apparent is who Hayley actually is, where she has come from, how she came to choose Jeff and what untimely is her goal, what does she want to achieve and why? We soon learn that Jeff isn't whiter than snow as Hayley exposes the skeletons in his closet, so he's a bad person, fair enough. But if she knew this why not just tell the police? Could it be that she enjoys torturing people? Is she crazy? A lot of these questions remain unanswered and not so the viewer can interpret it themselves like in French movie hidden, it seems to me that it would have made more sense to give Hayley some background instead she arrives and leaves like a underage ghost. The two central performances are excellent and the way the film is shot makes for claustrophobic and uneasy viewing which all add to the twisted tension. The colour is also very bleak and washed out which I think is a direct reference to Jeff's situation. Hard candy isn't a bad film by any means and it carries itself quite well but as it finished I felt empty like I needed a little more it was too open ended to really stick with me and by the time I'd left the cinema I'd forgotten who Hayley and Jeff were, maybe that was intentional to suggest that they only existed to each other in cyberspace and so only existed to the viewer for the time you spent watching film. Either way I thought it was good but not really what I expected.",Hard Candy
121,cosmic_quest,A mess which sends out the wrong message,3,25 October 2006,"I found the messages of the film to be very confusing, as if the scriptwriter was unsure whether he was aiming to show society is too obsessed with paedophiles that we risk condemning the innocent or that paedophiles do deserve to meet a sticky end. The premise of 'Hard Candy' involves fourteen-year-old Hayley meeting up with Jeff, a thirty-two-year-old fashion photographer whom she has been chatting with on-line. Initially, the two seem the best of friends although Jeff is unsure of how to treat Hayley given her age. And then he realises that she is no innocent young girl but someone with a very dangerous vendetta against him.To be fair to the actors, they do give good performances. Patrick Wilson, as Jeff, portrays the character to have ambiguous motives towards the girl while Ellen Page, who plays Hayley, delivers a vindictive, almost manic edge to her depiction although she was a bit too old for the role and that took away the shock of seeing someone so young participating in such violence.The problem with this film, as I said before, is that it wasn't sure what it intended the audience to take home from it. Pity the paedophile? Children ask to be molested? Just looking at child pornography doesn't make you a real pervert? Hayley is a bad, bad girl? That's what it seemed the film wanted us to think. 'Hard Candy' works on the premise that Hayley is the antagonist while Jeff is the 'shades of grey' protagonist but those who have seen the effects of molestation has on children would argue that he deserved his fate the minute he knowingly invited a child (and yes, a fourteen-year-old is still very much a child not matter how flirtatious they are) back to his home.This film would have been quite powerful had Hayley subjected Jeff to all her tricks only to realise he didn't realise her age and he would never touch a child, in a scenario similar to where vigilantes murder the wrong person leaving a bitter taste in their idea of justice and opening up the complexities of taking the law into one's own hands. However, when it is revealed he has images of child porn in his house and we know from the onset he was aware of how old (or rather, how young) Hayley was, it is very hard to feel pity for him and his plight. Perhaps it's just me but I don't want to empathise with paedophiles. Not to mention, it is even harder to feel sympathy for Jeff when he had so many opportunities to escape yet to chose to stay at the house to pay Hayley back for what she put him through.There is also little reflection on why Hayley does all this. What tips a seemingly normal fourteen-year-old kid to become so twisted and vengeance-driven? How did she manage to solve the missing child's case yet the police are still floundering? We are, after all, talking about a kid at an age where she's barely allowed the cross the street by herself let alone gallivant around the city, solving major crimes like a junior, psycho version of Jessica Fletcher.What could have been an excellent film that draws out many ethical debates on vigilantism and the dangers of proclaiming people 'guilty until proved innocent', it's just a mess that seems to try to elicit empathy for the last group of people on this planet who deserve it.",Hard Candy
122,ExpendableMan,Just when you thought it was safe to go back on the Internet,8,10 July 2007,"Jeff Kohlver (Patrick Wilson) is a 32 year old professional photographer with everything going for him. A nice house, respectable career, good looks and charm, he's really not the sort of person you'd expect to be perusing the Internet, chatting up underage girls. Then one day, he manages to persuade Hayley (Ellen Page), a sweet and bubbly 14 year old he talks to in a chat room to meet up with him at a local coffee shop. Jeff Kohlver, is about to have a really bad day...Essentially a two-person film with ninety percent of the action taking place in the same apartment, Hard Candy is a tense and powerful film from first time director David Slade. Working with the simple premise of a young girl turning the tables on a sexual predator, it manages to be gripping throughout and features a terrific pair of central performances from two very talented actors. It also displays Slade's talent for visual flair, using the evocative colours of Jeff's flat to betray underlying character emotions in a highly professional manner that shows off a stylish music video background. Hopefully, it'll be the start of something big for all three key players involved.To start with, Ellen Page as Hayley is phenomenal. She is talented enough to make her character's transformation from an adorable young girl into an avenging angel of retribution entirely plausible and unforced. Blessed with some fantastic lines, a wealth of cynicism and a heavy dose of insanity, Page puts in a star making performance with all the depth and maturity that a certain Jodie Foster showed early in her career. Her on screen foil Patrick Wilson is no less impressive and even as the evidence piles up and the extent of his perversion becomes apparent, he is still capable of wringing some sympathy for the audience despite being a truly disgusting individual.With its themes of torture and revenge, Hard Candy therefore is the thinking man's answer to the Saw and Hostel movies. Where those films favour gore and violence, this one prefers character studies and psychological trauma. It's not a happy film and certainly not the kind of thing you'd pop into your local multiplex on a Friday night to watch, but it is an intense emotional roller-coaster that will leave you drained. Just make sure you watch Happy Feet or something afterwards or you might go to bed feeling a bit more grim than normal.",Hard Candy
123,OldAle1,Terrific performances and nice photography don't compensate for extreme unpleasantness,5,25 November 2008,"There are an awful lot of great movies that have been made about voyeurism, sexual predators, revenge, etc; this film goes deeper than most into many of these themes, but sadly falls far short of greatness. There's no way I can say anything much about it without significant spoilers, so be warned.Precocious teen Hayley (Ellen Page, quite brilliant) meets much older photographer Jeff (the always excellent Patrick Wilson) in an internet chatroom, and then for real at a coffee shop. It's ""meet-cute"" with lots of saucy, seductive banter -- mostly on the part of Ellen -- and though it's engagingly filmed (lots of close-ups and interesting cutting in the early scenes, in brightly lit widescreen) it unsettled me, not because of the ickiness factor but because I didn't buy it. I didn't buy for a second that Ellen was going to be a victim, which was fine -- she obviously knows what she's doing, that's believable -- but that lead me not to buy that Jeff would go along with it. Is he so wrapped up in his good fortune that he doesn't see her playing him? Perhaps, but the film strives for a lot of realism throughout and this was the first element that didn't work.When they leave the cafe and head to Jeff's somewhat remote hilltop suburban ranch home, the troubles really begin, both for Jeff who is soon to get more than he could possibly have bargained for, and the viewer, who is treated to a higher level of sadism and a more excruciating, drawn out series of psychological tortures than necessary or perhaps possible. The serious problem, ultimately for me is that the film having demonstrated that Ellen is at least a borderline psychopath then lets her off the hook by demonizing Jeff in an entirely unambiguous and exploitational way. The end result is that we are supposed to cheer on Ellen as she completes her horrifying but seemingly righteous plan; some will buy it and love it. I didn't, and the terrific performances and interesting film-making choices did not redeem it. DVD rental",Hard Candy

So, a thirty something man is having a messaging 'relationship' with a teenager....OK? No, not OK, and this is where this film really breaks a mould. As I watched I had the French film 'A Ma Soeur' at the back of my mind. Both films demonstrate that girls are 'groomed' and sexualised in so many ways it is almost impossible to grow up without experiencing the nasty side to this. More films like this ought to be made...the victim turns out not to be a lie down and take it victim...this victim takes revenge...the girl understands there are consequences.

Extraordinary acting between these two and I would say Ellen Page in her best performance to date. She is a phenomenal actress. The picture of Hard Candy explains itself.

She has met Jeff, a photographer more than twice her age, on line and has a face to face meeting with him at a coffee shop.She invites herself to his house, and at this point our sympathies are 100% with Hayley. Why is this wonderful girl doing such a foolish thing and putting herself in potential danger? Once they get there she mixes cocktails and gets him drunk. He wakes up to find himself bound. She is convinced that he's a pedophile, and is going to bring justice to him.And this is where the story, to me, unravels. Is this an After School Special version of ""Kill Bill"" or ""Mercy""?

Unfortunately, by the time we reach the one hour mark I was so sick and tired of both characters that I was ready to turn it off or use the fast forward button.After all, this was the writer/director team who made the highly entertaining ""40 Days of Night"" soon after this. They were going to pull a rabbit out of a hat and make all this worth my while.Nope. The last scene takes place on the roof of Jeff's house. These two very irritating people stand and shout exposition at each other, some stuff happens, the closing titles roll. Being on the roof they could have been struck by lightning but it's a sunny day. Darn it.Since I neither liked nor cared about either character there just wasn't much going for me in this.

128,happyendingrocks,Every man who watches this is guaranteed to squirm uncomfortably for at least 20 minutes,8,26 September 2010,"This brutal and merciless revenge fantasy is fine proof that a great film-maker doesn't need a big budget or flashy effects to conduct a minor masterpiece.Most of the action in Hard Candy takes place on one set, and the bulk of the film is dialogue driven, relying only on a sharp and thoughtful storyline and two career-defining performances. This combination could spell disaster in the wrong hands and with the wrong stars, but director David Slade was fortunate enough to find the two actors to perfectly essay the difficult and unflattering parts integral to the movie.Ellen Page is simply brilliant here, and her ability to make the audience forget they're watching a very young and untested actor has only been equaled in one other performance I can think of: Natalie Portman's stunning turn in The Professional. But even the best protagonist needs an equally engaging foil to soar on screen, and Page finds her ideal dark muse with Patrick Wilson's Jeff. Wilson accomplishes the nearly impossible task of being both a foul and malevolent force as well as a charming and ultimately sympathetic character, even after we find out what he keeps stashed in his safe. Credit both the film-makers and Wilson for shaping a nuanced monster for whom we can't help but feel at least a shred of pity when he receives his final punishment.The sparring between the two is engrossing and methodical, and despite their collective relative inexperience, the two forge a magical chemistry that elevates the performances of each of them. Though emotionally complex, this is a fairly simple production, so these two characters are relied upon to carry the entire film. Both Page and Wilson are more than up for the challenge, and no matter how uncomfortable this film is to watch at times, their performances will captivate anyone who appreciates textbook displays of great acting.Since Hard Candy deals openly with pedophilia and child pornography, the film would be shocking and intense even without the taut and masterfully played action sequences. By exploring these loathsome circumstances with an unflinching eye, this immediately becomes an unsettling piece of cinema that will haunt the viewer well after they've ejected the DVD.Despite the over-the-top acts we see carried out here, the extended sequences of torture that unfold throughout the film are not gratuitous in the least. In fact, these scenes are far more effective because of what we don't see, forcing us to complete the image in our own minds and bringing the viewer into the frame in a way that most films simply aren't intelligent enough to muster.Since we can universally agree that pedophiles are the most vile souls on the planet (I hope), the film is able to get away with even the blackest bits of vengeance. This is another tool that further ensconces the viewer in the happenings, since most of us will decide by default that our villain ""deserves"" everything he gets. The film offers us a voyeuristic view into a scenario in which a predator becomes the prey, then indirectly asks us to condone even the most horrific of actions. But since these acts are portrayed with honest and unflinching ugliness, we're forced to question our unnatural investment in the grand come-uppance that develops throughout the film. I'm not sure how much social commentary was intended here, but this movie studies the audience as deeply as it studies its characters.The extended castration sequence is certainly destined to be the most notorious bit of nastiness here, and the twist pertaining to that is a brilliant move that somehow makes the whole process even more sadistic and shocking. The result of this macabre surgery is a masterful stroke that displays the savvy and creativity of the film-makers to excellent effect.This isn't a film that you're likely to re-visit often, but even watching Hard Candy once will be enough to embed its bleak and uncompromising vision into your mind. There are moments in this movie that you will never forget, and it will be impossible to look at either of these actors again without recalling their benchmark work here.If you've got the stomach for the material, this is a powerful and truly original film that you most assuredly should not miss.",Hard Candy
129,ferdinand1932,Loses plausibility,3,6 December 2011,"This starts well then descends into hackneyed retribution. The problem lies in the plotting which follows a deliberate arc which prevents the movie from taking chances, or of using surprise or turning the tables once it has adopted a route. On the plus side it has the intensity of a play and use of language is quite good too. At the start there is a sense of chance of uncertainty as to how it might play out. The interplay between the two leads is compelling as is the overall production. Where it falters is the underpinning to piece, the sense of reality which are the plausible elements are essential. In an escapist movie they are not important.The audience is expected to believe that the 14 year old protagonist is an expert strategic thinker, that is, one able to conceive of complex plans to several stages and be able to preempt challenges. Any contact with a real teenager knows they are not very good at strategic thinking, not at the level of an adult planner. This is important because it requires the audience to accept that the teen can achieve what she does with a ruthless ability. In addition she must use her physical strength to tie ropes in complex knots; ropes seen to be bulky, but again a teen female has small hands, not strong upper arms and is generally not able to do such things. The actor in the movie has a slight physique and it poses the question as to how the rope-tying can be done. Finally, the teen female must move a dead weight male which is only barely possible. Moving a body that is a dead weight is very hard, even for a grown male, moving such a body into positions harder and the audience is asked to believe that a 14 year old can do all that is pushing plausibility too far. This film requires plausibility to work, or the set up and the ideas in the film are not to be taken seriously, it is just another stylistic revenge movie.",Hard Candy

Suspecting that he is a pedophile, she goes to his home in an attempt to expose him.As you can tell from the very inviting summary, you can tell this is going to be one weird movie. And let me tell you, it is. This hard-to- watch movie really does push limits. Limits that the viewers have to choose. I did like this film, the pacing and intensity grows quickly and sometimes (hard to say) the film has you rooting for the pedophile; even though you don't know whether or not he is. The film even takes darker tones as the girl runs through his stuff attempting to break him out of his lies. Lies? We don't know. The most intense parts are when the guy is struggling to break free and we want him to! He looks to innocent and this girl is obviously psycho. But the film keeps on going. I have to complain on one thing though, that really did bump it down 2 stars. The whole castration scene was too drawn out; a stupid premise in the first place. And very boring. If that would've been taken out, this film would possibly be in the 9 or 10's. Anyways, this film can keep you into it. I only recommend it for a few out there. 7/10.",Hard Candy
131,CineCritic2517,About the negative commentary,6,26 September 2006,"Almost all the negative comments revolve around either the story being too unbelievable or a case of hopeless dialog or acting. Furthermore there is a complaint about subtlety on the subject of pedophilia....to address the latter: lighten up folks; it's a (horror) movie, not an educational promo.I'm not a particular fan of the horror genre but this film, despite the obvious plot holes and -twists, did have something going for it. Namely it being suspenseful and disturbing (i.o.w. getting to you) which cannot be said of e.g. Hostel or Saw. Unfortunately, at times the story is just too unbelievable, But that is perhaps why it is called a horror (That being also the reason i don't particularly like this genre). What is truly a shame about it, is the way it developed towards the end. I feel imagination was having dinner somewhere when the screenwriters were about half way into the story.If u want to complain only about bad acting or poor directing, there are numerous movies especially in this genre that deserve some bitchin'. On the balance and in the case of Slade and of Wilson and Page that really makes no sense. Just don't compare this flick to the classic thriller.It's true that the dialog is pretty repetitive but I believe it to serve the story. It frustrates the viewer in a way that it makes the predicament of Jeff come alive.All in all its just the story taking a very bad turn but i wouldn't go as far as calling this one a stinker.Points for: Acting:8 Directing:8 Cinematography:8 Story:3 Dialog:6This could have been a lot worse and it's still worth a seeing.6/10",Hard Candy
132,ScottDMenzel,"""Hard Candy"" is a powerful and disturbing look at people we meet on the Internet.",9,9 April 2006,"""Hard Candy"" is about a teenage girl named Hayley (Ellen Page) who likes to surf the web and explore internet dating like most normal teenagers. The film opens up with an instant message chat between Hayley and a much older guy named Jeff (Patrick Wilson). Jeff and Hayley plan to meet up later that day, where their meeting turns into an unexpected series of events. A very intense psychological drama ensues I just got back from an advanced screening of ""Hard Candy"" at the Philadelphia Film Festival. And let me be the first to say, this movie was remarkable. The idea behind this film is so powerful and disturbing at the same time. This movie focuses on two people, Hayley who is a 14 year old girl and a 30 something pedophile named Jeff. A movie's subject matter is something that is a serious issue in the world and I think this movie takes the idea of it to a new and unique level.During this film, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. You watch with amazement as this little teenage girl who seems so innocent really controls the entire situation. She is smart and has planned everything and anything and the film flows together so nicely. Even though Hayley isn't an overly likable character, I was cheering her on throughout the whole film. She was such an intelligent and wicked character who seemed to be just sickened by pedophiles.Another thing which was very interesting about this film was that it actually relied more on the facial expressions and dialog then on actual images. There is one part in the film which is extremely disturbing and is something I never seen in a film before. The scene involves Hayley doing an operation to say it in an inexplicit way. During that scene, we never see what's happening but it was spine tingling just seeing the emotions and listening to the dialog of the characters. A powerful scene which was so intense and disturbing I may never forget it.Lastly, I liked how even though the film was a very powerful drama, the script had some light humor in it as well. The line about Roman Polanski was a classic as well as the whole ""I'm an honor roll student"" line. The film is so serious at times, it was nice to get a chuckle here and there to allow audiences to take a breather from being pinned to their seats with suspense.Like I previously stated there are only two real characters in this movie those being Hayley and Jeff. Ellen Page does an incredible job and delivers a mind-blowing performance. Her character is both demented and likable. Patrick Wilson was great as well. He gave a very interesting and powerful performance as a pedophile who didn't want to admit he had a problem. His emotions during this film were incredible and extremely realistic.""Hard Candy"" was directed by first time filmmaker David Slade. I feel this is a breathtaking and powerful first film about an uneasy subject matter that so few talk about. His unique craft of capturing not only the characters emotions and anger but also the unique camera angles is remarkable. Also the unique scenes of darkness and colors were brilliant. I like the fact that the director didn't make the characters out to be fictional characters but someone who we can meet on a daily basis.The screenplay was written by Brian Nelson who is also a first time screenwriter for a feature film. I normally don't review how I feel about the screenplay but this one was so unique and daring that I feel I have to. The way the script develops the characters is amazing and how the film actually has a real ending instead of one of those cop-out choose your own ending films that so many people are using nowadays. What the film does is leaves everything at the end open to discussion. Why did Hayley do what she did? Who is Hayley really and so forth. It's an incredible screenplay that Mr. Nelson should be extremely proud of.Bottom Line: ""Hard Candy"" was such an amazing film with powerful, intense scenes and great acting. The script is extremely fresh and takes the idea of a pedophile film to a new level. This film allows its audience to think and also be shocked by what's going on during the film. It's not a movie for those who like light-hearted films or films that are completely resolved in the end. Hard Candy is really one of those mind f*ck films that when you leave the theater you just want to talk about what just happened. It's a remarkable film that will stay with me for many weeks to come.MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""Hard Candy"" is a 9/10. A powerful yet disturbing film that touches on a subject matter that is constantly being ignored in our world but be warned this film is definitely not for the weak hearted crowd.",Hard Candy
133,TheMovieMark,Not the easiest film to watch...,6,28 April 2006,"Well. That was disturbing. Though it is not one to recommend for ""Family Night,"" Hard Candy offers an intriguing one-time viewing thanks to the effectiveness of its two-man show approach. Let's make that a one-man, one-girl show. I don't need a rash of emails reminding me of my chauvinism.What the filmmakers have done is said, ""Hey, Patrick Wilson! Ellen Page! We're placing the two of you in a restricted space and putting the entire movie on your shoulders. Best of luck!"" Granted, I'm paraphrasing, but this is no exaggeration. There are a total of five people in the movie, and only Wilson and Page are given more than five minutes of screen time. Given this challenge, the two thespians more than hold their own.I don't know if Wilson should take this as a compliment, but he's very convincing as a dangerously innocent-seeming pedophile. What makes him so creepy is his charm. He's a smooth, suave sexual predator. Most young girls are smart enough to do wind sprints the moment they see a dirty, unkempt man who looks to be carrying more diseases than Paris Hilton.But Wilson is a good-looking, successful photographer. He can't be bad, right? ""You look older than you are, and you certainly act older than you are,"" he tells Hayley, perfectly manipulating her young, fragile emotions. And hey, he can't be dangerous. After all, he obviously has the most innocent of intentions! Why else would he reassure her that he's aware of the legal boundaries? She's puddy in his hands.This all starts quietly enough, but once they get to his house gears are shifted and everything goes haywire. That's all I'm revealing regarding the story, but I do have to give kudos to Ms. Page who turns in an impressive performance. I did feel she was a bit too precocious and world-wise at times, but she still does a great job showcasing a wide range of emotions of this potential young victim.Despite the interesting concept of the two-person show, it clearly has its limitations. At 103 minutes this is just way too long. After a while it becomes too obvious that certain scenes and lines of dialogue are, like most songs on recent Rolling Stones albums, inserted for no other reason than to serve as filler. The worst example being a scene involving Sandra Oh's neighbor character. The only purpose it serves is to deliver a little faux drama. That subplot is dropped faster than Britney Spears' baby, never to be heard from again.Hard Candy refuses to send you prancing home with a smile on your face or a song in your heart, but if nothing else it serves as a strong warning that you should probably pay close attention to who your kids are communicating with online. At least warn them that sometimes the person they least suspect could be the one to be most wary of.A quick word of warning to all you guys: there is one particular scene where what we perceive is happening will absolutely make you squirm in your seat. You'll most likely watch it through squinted eyes. I haven't felt that uncomfortable at the theater since the My Own Private Idaho fiasco. I suggest you be prepared.",Hard Candy

To me it's a horror movie in Alfred Hitchcock's style. The real monster in this movie was a girl, though that guy wasn't saint but there are people much worse than him. It's not an entertaining movie, actually I don't remember that any other movie would be so unbearably cruel, with such a sick dialogs, that it was a real challenge to watch it (though when I for the first time watched Reservoir Dogs, I had a similar feeling during the ""ear scene""). This movie contains more psychological than physical violence, it kinda reminded me of Blue Velvet which was also very cruel.

135,RockPortReview,Ellen Page rocks the screen!,8,11 February 2010,"Hard Candy 2/7/2010This little indie flick introduced us to Ellen Page and director David Slade. Made for under a million dollars, the film made a big impact thanks its stand out performance by Patrick Wilson and the aforementioned Page. This film was shot with only four main actors over an 18 day period in California. Since then Slade has gone on to direct ""30 Days of Night"" and the upcoming Twilight film ""Eclipse.""Ellen Page plays Haley, a 14 year old girl, who meets Wilson's 32 year old character, Jeff, over the internet. They decide to meet at a coffee shop to talk. Jeff is a photographer and interested in a lot of the same things as Haley. This in itself is a little creepy and unnerving. After a little pushing and teasing (the t-shirt Scene) Haley gets Jeff to invite her over to his apartment. The whole film has an unnerving balance to it. While Haley is far more mature that her 14 years, Jeff should surely know better. At his apartment, Jeff offers her alcohol and she accepts. They talk and Haley wants her picture taken. The story then does a complete 180 degree turn as Jeff's drink has been drugged. Haley ties him up and holds him prisoner and interrogates him on the other girls he's done this too. She wants him to admit he is a sick and twisted pedophile, but it he? He has obviously made some pretty poor decisions, but does he really deserve what Haley has in store for him?Page is a actress that can convincingly play someone much younger that she really is. Although it wasn't much of a stretch in this film, as she was 17 during filming. Her shy girlish demeanor quickly transform into the smart, bad ass chick that physically and mentally tortures Jeff. You could say in some scenes that Jeff could easily over power Haley and take back control, but what can he do, she's only 14. No matter how you look at it, it's going to end badly for Jeff.There is one disturbing scene where guys everywhere will cover their eyes and run away screaming. Haley decides to castrate Jeff to teach him a lesson; this is a difficult scene to watch no matter who you are. Does she really go through with it? You'll have to watch. The back and fourth between these characters is what elevates this film into something more that your average revenge fantasy film. The only problem I have with it is the ending. I can see how they arrive at it, but don't really agree with it. They never really tell you who Haley really is and her motivations for are kind of alluded to, but are still kind of fuzzy. This film is an intriguing little nugget that should be seen.",Hard Candy
136,karl_consiglio,Rubbish,1,3 July 2007,"Potentially the worst film I ever watched. I knew it was going to be crap as soon as it started, the acting is hopeless. I did not know yet though just how bad it was going to be. The plot is utterly lame and pointless, I could not help commenting all the way through, not because it was morbid, I watch lots of morbid films, but because it had no concept whatsoever. This film is utterly useless, uneducational, unentertaining, very boring, useless. And it lacks logic, the characters, are utterly stupid. Its so exaggerated. This film is a sad reflection on the entire educational system in America, not that we had not seen enough already. Two thumbs down, way down.",Hard Candy
137,aprilsfriendorin,"Intense, Captivating, and Worth Watching",8,25 August 2020,"Before you watch, be aware that this movie is pretty intense and grapples with some dark themes, so if you're not prepared for that you should find something else. If you're a fan of Misery, you'll probably like this movie- they're similar in a lot of ways. The acting is fantastic, and the comedy is woven in perfectly. It manages to make you laugh despite all the horrific stuff happening. If I had one complaint, I would say it lags a little- it could be maybe ten minutes shorter, or they could've tried to figure out more stuff to do (perhaps with Sandra Oh's character, who is barely in it). You have to suspend your disbelief at some points, but if you're willing to do so then it's a very captivating movie and well worth watching.Also, I just want to point out that the majority of the bad reviews have come from men who are really upset at the idea of a young girl dominating a grown man. Or men who are really infuriated at the concept of a man being castrated. Some of them are even just Karens who hate the idea of a girl having a short haircut, which is just bizarre. Look- if you're a man who is not wildly insecure regarding their masculinity, you're gonna be fine. If you hate this movie solely because of its subject matter, then you probably need to do some re-evaluating on yourself.",Hard Candy
138,huh_oh_i_c,"Because of ""Lolita""'s disease, Hayley should've taken more candy",6,13 September 2006,"Hard Candy failed because it is based on the actors, but it didn't manage to make Hayley a tat more symphatetic, the evidence against Jeff should have been stronger. What would have rescued it, would have been very suggestive rather than explicit flashbacks of Hayley being raped or molested. Also, David Slade said that the actress playing Hayley should'nt have been old looking, he complained bitterly about all the 15 year old actresses in LA who look 21 and worse, act 21 too! Yet, Ellen Page did not once convince me that she was 14. Mainly because of her low voice, but also her vocabulary. Sure, precocious kids use fancy words to show off, but she didn't use it too show off, she used them because she knew them. Or rather, such was her acting and Slades direction. She used fancy words like an adult. At times, she seemed much older that the 17 year old that she is. Another thing which makes Hayley so unsympathetic, is the absolutely certainty with which she judges the pedofile. This is not unlike the proponents of the death penalty. Advocating the death penalty is based on the conviction that people cannot make mistakes with giving the death penalty. Of course, this has been proved tragically wrong, over the years. Some sort of video evidence against the guy would have gone a long way toward the movie's credibility. I can surely believe that Hollywood actresses today, are so old-looking and old-acting, at a young age. I was shocked when I found out that Dominique Swain was only 16 or 17 when she played the 14 year old Lolita role, she looked at least 21. It hasn't been since Paper Moon that an actress or actor played her or his own age in the under 16 bracket. In 99 percent of the cases they are three years older. And they look it often too, and they always behave older. Sofia Vassieleva in Eloise at the Plaza, was 11 when she played six-year-old Eloise. To her credit she doesn't look much older than 6 (but surely behaves like it). This is the problem with this kinda movie, believability in the actor/actresses age, since Adrian Lyne's fruitless efforts also known as Lolita's Disease.Interestingly, but unavoidable given the subject matter perhaps, is that Hard Candy shows less of the female body (of course I mean clothed, there isn't any nudity or even something akin to nudity, in either) than the average movie of the week or teen comedy.",Hard Candy

After his neighbor saw her there and looked as if she really didn't believe the bullsh!t story Haylie gave her (and with good reason), with evidence all over his house...he still jumps! Once I realized that I still had my family jewels I was waiting there until I caught up with her, killed her off and buried her in my back yard! For him as a grown man to let a 14 year old do this to you?? You can't be serious! I was seriously waiting for him to throw Haylie off that roof in the end. Just as she herself said, group meetings and a little time in prison IF everything stuck (and that's a big IF), throwing yourself off a roof was NOT the only way...but he was stupid enough to do it. You know the movie is bad when you actually root for the pedophile in this situation! They made Haylie so obnoxious that you found it impossible to side with her. Who was actually worse here? I don't think I've ever seen 2 characters as annoying, obnoxious and plain STUPID as these two.

Then it comes to a classical psychological thriller and you just can't realize which character is right on their purposes.It's desperating. All the times the guy tries to scape, he backs arrested again for some dumb acts. It's hard to imagine that a 14 y.o. b*tch is able to control a huge situation like that. But that's OK, if it wasn't like that, this movie wouldn't exist, right? And it's fictitious, so... the plot was going very fine till Jeff finally releases himself discovering that his nuts was OK. He should really tried to call 911 and not going after that sl*tty b*tch expecting to kick her ass off, this is the most stupid thing about psychological thrillers. ""Scream"" already told this formula: instead of the girl runs out the door she runs up to the stairs. The same thing happens here: instead of the guy just run away or call 911, he goes after revenge.OK, a revenge was necessary, but... If I was Jeff, I would just be slapping her ass until the police arrives because that was what she was needing.That disturbing end is just a mess, for me Janelle's appearance was all about covering some holes on the plot making an easier end to the movie. So, the entire movie was all about Jeff finally kills himself in the end just because the sl*tty girl was a psycho-player? No, that wasn't right. His life wasn't over yet, he didn't killed the girl, he has been tortured and arrested by a crazy b*tch for hours and even Jeff having some secrets she couldn't find anything but a picture of the girl that has been killed, a picture which he could just burn and all the facts would only points to what Hayley has been done.When the movie ended I just said to myself: Just another sh*t!It's a shame.

142,LanceBrave,A Film Designed to Start Conversation,9,8 November 2013,"It's probably says a lot about my taste in women that twice I've watched ""Hard Candy"" on dates and neither time did it mean the immediate end of the relationship. Most people wouldn't consider a movie about child molestation, pedophilia, castration, and psychological torture particularly great social viewing. And yet, this is a film designed to start conversation. It always gets people talking.You could debate whether or not ""Hard Candy"" is a horror film. It certainly doesn't feature any supernatural elements and its sickening violence takes place wholly off-screen. Yet for me there's no debate at all. ""Hard Candy"" fits perfectly into the post-9/11 landscape of American horror. Not because of its heavy bondage and mental anguish but because it's a film about moral uncertainty. Obviously, it's also about gender politics and vigilantism but the filmmakers were mostly concerned with putting the audience in an uncomfortable place. Who do you root for? The pedophile or the psychotic fourteen year old? At times, both sides come off as sympathetic. Initially, most would be inclined to say any adult man who takes advantage of a young girl probably deserves to get his balls chopped off. But when Jeff is roped to the table, sweating in agony as his castration goes on, this viewer, as a man, can't help but feel a certain level of sympathy for the guy. As for the other half, Hayley is undoubtedly a charismatic figure. A four-teen year old girl resourceful and intelligent enough to pull off psychological warfare of this level can't help but be somewhat likable. (Not to mention the movie makes it seem plausible that a fourteen year old girl could take down an adult man.) Numerous times, Jeff thinks he gets the upper hand on the girl, believing he's playing on some perceivable insecurity or trying to explain his actions. It doesn't work. Hayley Stark is iron-willed and nothing will dissuade her from delivering her own brand of justice. But this isn't ""Death Wish"" and Ellen Page isn't Charles Bronson. Hayley is too vicious, too wicked. She's no feminist avenger or a hero. No one is in ""Hard Candy."" The moral ambiguity questions any notions of justice the audience might have.But ""Hard Candy"" is more then just an assault. It's one of the most tensely crafted thrillers I've ever seen. The direction is scalpel sharp. The movie is mostly confined to one location, Jeff's house, and we spend most of the runtime in only a few rooms. Despite the stage-like setting, the direction is deeply cinematic. Long shots are used effectively throughout. The camera swirls around the operating table during the infamous castration sequence, zipping behind walls, unbroken. The contours of the actor's faces become landscapes, driving home of the intensity of the two people's interaction. Like Hayley, David Slade's direction is concise and calculated, designed to ratchet up the material's hissing tension. Only a few times does he lapse into rickety shaky-cam. It's a big bummer that the latter attribute has dominated David Slade's career of diminished returns.The script is brilliant. The premise of a teenage girl turning the tables on a sexual predator is one of the catchier high-concept narrative hooks you could think of. The writers use this premise to build meaningful dialogue about our culture's treatment of gender, blame, and justice. While you could probably go on for pages about the movie's cultural deconstruction, ""Hard Candy"" is also a brilliant thriller. The movie is a power play between the two characters. Hayley dominates Jeff throughout most of the first half but, near the end, when the restraints come off, we remember this is an adult man chasing after a 4'11 girl who probably weights a ninety pounds soaking wet. The girl's cruelty lead to some brilliant pay-offs. Jeff's pained confession about his pedophilia's origin is curtly dismissed. Frequently thrillers can't pay-off on the tensions they built. Not a problem ""Hard Candy"" has. The film's climax, which is really just a line of dialogue, is liable to have audiences gasping in shock. All of this means a lot considering the movie really is just two people talking. As nerve-wrenchingly uncomfortable as the movie can get, it's early scenes, where adult man and teenage girl are flirting and playing cute with one another, a seduction on both sides, might just be the movie's most squirmy sequences. The only criticism you can level at the script is that maybe some of the early dialogue is a little ungainly and on the nose.All of these factors are important reasons for the movie's success. But two other aspects stand over all others: The performances. This is the movie that made me an Ellen Page fan. It's the kind of performance that only comes around every once in a while. The conviction in her voice is frightening. It would have been easy to play Hayley Stark as a cartoonish super villain. Instead, she's all too human. The sweat on Page's brow, or the shake in her voice, suggests she is as nervous as the audience is, even when in control. Of course, Hayley is in control, the whole time. The power Page summons in her tiny frame is highly impressive. Her pixie haircut seems to emphasize how young she appears. Raging, clever, occasionally insecure but never weak, it's one of my all-time favorite performance. Patrick Wilson isn't any slouch either. He too never undersells the complexity of Jeff's character. He is a fully formed human being, suffering, even if he questionably deserves it. A moment at the end, when the weeping, broken Jeff is curled up in Hayley's arms, is almost heart-breaking. ""Hard Candy"" is a two person show and both actors stand up to each other.Confrontational films like this obviously serve a purpose. But confrontation isn't enough. Unlike a lot of controversial, transgressive movies, ""Hard Candy"" has more in mind then preaching. It's an incredibly intense thriller and a showcase for two extraordinary actors.",Hard Candy

The whole I got you, now I am going to make you kill yourself, is just stupid. The whole movie was boring. You know what this movie reminds me of, and never saw this one before it. Knock Knock, which I thought was dumb, but better than this one.This movie with Patrick just makes him look bad as he did in The Conjuring. Never thought Conjuring was scary, and never will, and this was never even that much of a thriller. This also reminds me of a women I met that always said some hateful things about men. None, of it was all true, but just some of it.No matter what you say to these women, they just keep arguing. Nothing pleases them. Just as bad as conspiracy theorists. Debate after debate. Nothing comes out right, but hey keep arguing just to think it pleases them. Nothing ever gets to be the right thing.If anyone is a psycho, it is these people that think they can say something and hope it makes it all better. Life is just bad for everyone, but making it worse, does not make it better. Stopping someone you think is a bad person, does not mean anything, because there are more out there.So many innocent people getting thrown in prison for what the actual person that did it gets away. So many people take things too far, and never find out the truth. Oh well, for those people. They think they are so smart, but in reality, they are not. Confessions are not always the truth.",Hard Candy
145,Ozzy2000,controversial,8,6 July 2008,"Directed by David Slade and written by Brian Nelson who both later combined to do ""30 days of night"" this film is well paced and some originality. This far fetched story focus on Internet pedophilia which is a bit sensationalised as it constitutes only a very small percentage of the crime. Most pedophilia is committed by family or trusted friends and/or supervisory persons. None the less this tale is about a precocious 14 year old girl, Haley Stark, (played by Ellen Page of ""X-Men last stand"" and later ""Juno"") who entraps a 30 year Fashion Photographer Jeff Kohlver (played by Patrick Wilson) in to an in person encounter in a public place from an Internet chat room encounter. They then go to his house. Apparently it becomes established Jeff is a pedophile and Hayley unleashes her plan after drugging him by mixing drinks at his house. What follows is a horrific imprisonment of Jeff by Hayley in which she takes the law into her own hands. At this stage they both become criminals in terms of law but naturally the audience is drawn into favour Hayley when her detailed motives rare revealed.A totally implausible film which focuses on the Pedophile problem but really fails to provide a real solution to the problem. Although the film was a flop it brought good exposure to the tiny Canadian actress Ellen Page. The merit of the film is the tension and intrigue created by just two characters in a room for most of the film which is a great challenge for any film story.",Hard Candy
146,Der_Schnibbler,"What a sick, disgusting, depraved little girl this was (SPOILERS)",1,9 June 2013,"Oh, the raving lunatic liberal 'feminist' who thought of this film must be frigging themselves in delight every time they watch it. 'Evil white male gets exposed!' What a typical piece of American tripe.SPOILERSI normally never give spoilers away but this film has just made me lose all patience.Some disturbed, sick little girl decides to 'expose' a supposed pedophile, so she seduces him, then ties him up and tortures him until he admits to his guilt.It sounds good, but it didn't work out so well on film.The film would've been understandable if at first Jeff seemed decent and then he really DID turn out to be a pedophile, and it was BELIEVABLE, i.e. there were clues from the start showing his behavior being a little off. But they made him look every bit like a decent guy, then inserted some lame twist in the end. The movie starts out incredibly unrealistic as it is, with the guy flirting with a 14-year- old girl in an overt sexual manner, inviting her to a bar (in public?? who does that?) and then letting her drink alcohol in his house. WHO the hell does this???As far as the girl's character, Haley, she is just one sick, manic, bug- eyed-crazy little piece of trash. Go to hell, Haley character. Hope some day, in your imaginary post-credit cellular world, you meet a man who will beat you to a pulp the moment you dare open that stupid mouth of yours and treat you like the three-hole amusement skin bag that you are.This film is obviously a left wing extremist 'feminists'' wet dream. Just a good excuse to disparage straight white men.Once more: If Haley had been an innocent but determined would-be victim exposing an ACTUAL pedophile, this could've been a good film. Instead the film makes her ten times sicker than the 'villain' is ever supposed to be, then gives the 'villain' a last-minute lame twist so that his end is justified.Moronic Hollywood tripe, undoubtedly penned by frothing-at-the-mouth liberal loons.",Hard Candy
147,jake-law123,Cheesy thriller but a stylistic film,6,20 August 2014,"An 18 year old Ellen Page plays 14 year old ""Haley"" who is brought into the house of a 32 year old Jeff, (Patrick Wilson) after chatting online for 3 days. At first it's just a happy little get together. But ultimately becomes an outrageous thrill ride when she drugs him, ties him up, and exacts revenge on him for being an accused pedophile/serial killer of women.Ellen Page is strong willed, confident, and psychotically irresistible with her tomboyish outward appearance and her innocent little girl personality, making the film all the more fascinating and unique. Patrick Wilson is phenomenal as a pedophile that you start to have a little bit of sympathy for as the film progresses.It really had me going on certain scenes though, the whole process of the incision was just ground breaking, and Patrick Wilson story of Aunt Denise just had my jaw dropping, and I knew what I was truly in for. The whole time she was yelling at him for being a pedophile I was just like ""well how is what your doing any more justified?""The performances had to be the strongest part of the film. The writing didn't really impress me that much, and some parts in particular, I thought were kind of lame. The film is very controversial and gets you thinking, it's a twisted exploitation film that goes to several means to get its message across, (a very nice one at that). The dreaded shaky cam bothered me a substantial amount, its a style that's never impressed me and it makes simple things like opening a drawer seem out of control.The film is definitely likable if you're looking for a film to stick with you for a while, bringing up some fascinating questions about humanity. It's good but a few cheesy notches of being great. It's subtle, but when it comes to thrillers, sometimes it's necessary to go a little over the top to keep the pace going, and although the film was paced well enough, I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed that there wasn't even more twisted concepts thrown in. For what it is, and the budget it was brought on, it's a doable film. Well recommended.",Hard Candy
148,dougmacdonaldburr,Bollocks,2,18 March 2018,"The film is very well made and the premise is quite good, but I do have a lot of criticism. I will only mention what is in the trailer and back of the dvd First I will discuss the acting. There are only really two characters. Patrick Wilson's performance is brilliant. He has great emotional range and is very convincing in any situation. Ellen Page is also great, but she is not as strong. However, considering that this was one of her first films, it is still an impressive performance. Now for my criticism. My main issues are with the plot. As I said before, the premise has potential, but I really did not like what they did with it. Of course the pedophile photographer is a terrible person, and he needs to be stopped. That being said, I don't think a tiny 14 year old girl, who is also a wanna be vigilante, is the one to do it. Her character could have just reported him to the police as soon as she became aware of him. I know that would have been a very boring film, but I am making a larger point. Instead of doing it, she goes far out of her way to lure him in, and then turns out to be a crazy sadist. We could argue all day about which character is worse, but the fact that it is even a discussion is a problem. For a film like this to work, the hero needs to be a better person than the villain. So you can root for them to win. Instead with this, there are just two terrible people and it is hard to like either of them. In fact, there are times when I actually felt bad for the pedophile, and I resent the film makers for that. There will be some of the girl power gang who think this is great because there is a young woman inflicting violence instead of a man. I think these people have missed the point. You can either, get revenge by fighting fire with fire, and in doing so, forfeit the moral high ground, OR you can refuse to sink to the villains level and by doings so, keep moral superiority. Her character (and this whole film) tries to do both, but her character quickly crossed the line and I was unable to root for her after that, and her smug moral judgements seem laughable given her own actions. So despite this films potential, I did not like it.",Hard Candy
149,guilfisher-1,Most disgusting movie ever!!!!!!!,1,24 December 2006,"It scares me that there are so many positive comments on this disgusting film. Directed, obviously with relish, by David Slade (who's David Slade?) with the hopes that we never see any of his work again. Starring Patrick Stewart, a favorite of mine. Why Patrick did you do this horrendous film? You thought it was good script? You wanted to represent men being victims of little psychos like that brat in the person of Ellen Page? No more of her. She's horrible in this. I can't tell you how many times I wanted to smash her face in.Why does she get away with this? Who in their right mind let's the innocent die? Let's the killer get free? Slade get out of the business if you think this is entertainment. Somewhere in the film I fast forwarded through most of it just not to look at that little piece of crap called Ellen Page again. When I saw her gleefully skipping down the road at the end, I wished I had a gun to pop her one. She made me that sick. With an insipid face, the likes I hope to never see again.Yes, I am one person that doesn't think this is entertainment. And I'm also one who believes that its movies like this that spur on the real killings of today. These kind of films encourage the other psychos in the world. And Page should get lost.

As a kid Id always Daydream of being a vigilante and getting the bad guys that hurt kids like me. However this here was just too unrealistic, to ridiculous! You have a girl who must be what 4 ft & 90lbs wet by herself, who also should have been doing her homework and in bed for school the next day LOL Yet she's taking down a man who's 6 feet 175 + lbs BY HERSELF. You don't even want to give girls that age the idea to go after pedophiles like that ON THEIR OWN. At her age she shouldn't have been out of her parents site, let alone researching the streets to find pedophiles so she can take the law into her own hands, which again was done in such an unrealistic way it was ridiculous! And damn it, I'm not going to confront a pedophile, torture him and have him kill himself, oh no! His sick ass will be brought to justice ,so the whole world could know what he's done. He wouldn't get off that easy and I wouldn't put myself in danger like this girl did here. It just made no sense!",Hard Candy
152,nturner,Not an Easy Film to Watch - But Worth It,8,9 November 2008,"The subject matter of this film is extremely distasteful and something I normally eschew, but my video service told me that it thought I would like the film. It's kind of creepy to find out how right they were. Even though it makes me sick at my stomach to think of what takes place in the film, I have to admit that it was extremely good.First, let me try to tackle the subject matter - pedophilia. As a retired school teacher who worked thirty-two years day and night in efforts to benefit the lives of children, it makes my skin crawl to think that there are adults out there so deprived and willing to use children for their own perverted sexual gratification. They have no excuse. Period! That being said, I must admit that I am also repelled by the view of the children who are the victims in this media-steroid pumped society of ours. Yes, very young children who fall under the influence of these beasts are truly innocent victims, but teenaged girls (and, I suppose, boys) who seek out these liaisons over the Internet are more idiot than innocent. Still the burden of guilt falls to the adult - and rightly so. There is a great line in the film that goes something like fourteen year old girls are very good at pretending to be adult, but it is your job as the adult to stop that pretense.The basic premise of the film is that a girl who has been chatting online with an older man arranges a meeting in a neutral location and is then convinced to go with him to his home. From that point, the tables begin to turn. To disclose any more would spoil the film for anyone interested, but it turns out to be a taunt thriller with a startling message.The actors who play the girl and the pedophile are extraordinary. Most of the film is the conversation and interaction between the two, but Ellen Page as the girl and Patrick Wilson as the pedophile are so skilled that they keep you rapped to their every word and move. The script is crafted in such a way that your allegiance to one or the other is brilliantly tugged back and forth - extraordinary, considering you know that the man is a scummy bottom feeder from the very beginning.Hard Candy is not an easy film to watch, but a still a rewarding cinematic experience.",Hard Candy
153,Craig_McPherson,Sometimes the line separating predator and prey is razor thin,10,30 April 2006,"It's rare that I will set out to write a film review, only to find myself staring at the blinking cursor on the screen pondering how to begin as I replay scenes from a film over and over again in my mind. Such is the impediment that Hard Candy throws up. Essentially a two person play, the film efficiently takes character preconceptions and turns them on their head.The film tells the story of Jeff (Patrick Wilson in what is arguably is breakout role) and 14 year-old Hayley (Canadian actress Ellen Page, soon to be seen in X-Men III). The two hook up in an Internet chat room and the film begins with them agreeing to meet after three months of online conversation.At first encounter viewer unease sets in as Jeff appears to carry the unusually comfortable air of a pedophile predator when he is met with Hayley's obvious underage status. For her part, Hayley, who clearly should know better, appears uncommonly forward and confident. Simply put, all is not as it should be, and so begins the spiral of viewer unease as the two begin their moth and flame dance.Directed by relative newcomer David Slade, and written by television scriptwriter Brian Nelson, the movie not only messes heavily with the notion of just who is predator and who is prey, but remarkably manages to deliver moments of intense gore using nothing but dialogue. And yet, in spite of this, the movie had me squirming into the depths of my seat.In spite of its strengths, Hard Candy has a few knocks against it. The gore crowd that may be drawn to this film seeking another Hostel will be sadly disappointed. Others will find the subject matter of pedophilia and online stalking make for uncomfortable viewing. And still others will be disappointed in a film that is sparse on action and heavy on dialogue. If, however, you want a riveting psychological drama that will have you thinking and talking about it long after you leave the theatre, Hard Candy will go down easy, even if it does leave a bitter taste in your mouth.",Hard Candy
154,teh_mode,Yikes!,8,4 August 2006,"Jeff is a photographer who meets a young, yet articulate girl on the net. After some indecorous internet messaging between the 14 year old and her 32 year old compatriot, they agree to meet. After having found each other they discuss slightly-high brow middle class mundanities. Hayley, however, has another motive in mind, luring Jeff back to his apartment, playing the innocent teen before drugging Jeff with the simple gesture of pouring drinks herself. He winds up tied to a chair at the mercy of his now turned-vicious captor. She wants to know what he is thinking of inviting a 14 year old girl back to his apartment. The uncomfortable opening may have been full of quirky quips from our two leads, attempting to make us feel at ease in their presence, yet the director's choice of using extreme close-ups on our protagonists always makes you feel uncomfortable, as if it's invading your space. There is an eery buzz to the film that is subtle, yet acknowledgeable in the opening, and then hard on in the latter stages. We don't know why this man is dong what he is, yet we assume the worst. His date certainly doesn't seem like she doesn't know any better, and has plenty frames of reference to keep up with his own views on the world. Yet we still disagree with the morality of it. As it turns out so does Hayley, yet her choice of action would make any film-goer route for the potential pervert. That's how good this film is. It makes you route for the immoral one.Not everybody enjoys the masochistic side of cinema. The films that drill themselves into your psych so that you are fully unprepared by the shock that awaits are rare treats of full-on terror that open up all the negativity in your life and make you want to say things like ""I wish I had never done that. Man, I'm never going swimming again. I'll never look at a boy named Damian the same again. I doubt I'll go to Texas anytime soon"". In Hard Candy's case there quite a few things I doubt I'll be trying anytime soon. Internet dating is the biggest target here, although I'll make sure I pour my own drinks from now on. In classic horror style it takes a man of questionable morals - he photographs underage girls, and perhaps wants something more - and tears his soul (among other things) limb from limb. Although this man is by no means innocent, his impending fate at the hands of Hayley is instantly empathic. Without giving too much away, let's just say I don't like EVER seeing someone put in the positions and facing the circumstances he does. It's hard to disagree with pre-nubile psycho Hayley when she challenges Jeff's past misgivings, yet her methods of vengeance would make even Oldboy's Oh Dae-Su blush. In Saw it was a foot, in Oldboy it was a tongue (with a few teeth thrown in). Hard Candy goes that one step further, without even showing any graphic violence on screen, to make me quiver and hide behind my seat like no other movie has managed in quite some time. The very idea of it made me want to hurl, and when a movie attempts to make you feel this way and succeeds it achieves something great. You may not know it, but making audiences feel physically ill, on purpose, is quite a neat trick, and the masochism on scream was enough to make my screening churn and ""oohh"" in pain and horror. Hard Candy is quite possibly the toughest movie I've seen in awhile. There are moments when I really didn't want to be there, as the intensity, particularly from a male perspective, had me right on the edge. Yet it manages a very difficult task of keeping a neat balance between humour (albeit very sour) and dread. It'll keep you guessing right till the end and long in your memory for quite a while afterwards.",Hard Candy

156,postsenthil,A VERY GOOD WATCH !!,7,27 October 2019,"This psychological thriller turns the cat & mouse game on its head, a la Tom & Jerry, one may say. But, the content here is far removed from the innocent and enjoyable pranks of those animated characters.This is the story of how a young teenager Hayley (played true to form by Ellen Page) ensnares Jeff, a fashion photographer (Patrick Wilson) who is also a pedophile. She appears to be well aware of his modus and gradually entices him through conversations in internet chatrooms which culminates in an innocent ice-breaker meeting at a cafe. At the meeting where she comes fully prepared, she tempts him further and gets herself invited to his residence.What follows is a suspenseful thriller of twisted cat & mouse game filled with mind games where he tries to take full advantage of what he feels is a serendipitous development while she intends to deliver her own version of justice for his unholy deeds. She is smart to decline the drink offered by him which was not mixed in her presence and offers him a drink laced with sedative which he gleefully accepts without any qualms only to wake up hours later to find himself tied securely to a chair.Much of the movie takes place within the confines of his residence as interaction between just these two characters. Full credits to the two leads and especially to Ellen Page for wonderful and convincing performance and the director for spawning such a suspenful thriller which is also remarkably economical in more ways than one.Nevertheless, at the end of the movie, one gets a feeling that if Jeff is definitely a pedophile and deserves the punishment, there appears something deeply & chillingly wrong with Hayley too, though the jury is out on that one.",Hard Candy

I still can't get over that there are only five characters in this movie. (""Moon"" also had something like half a dozen people, but it doesn't really count, and when you watch it you'll see why.) Ellen Page is amazing as a teenaged psychopath, and she really held her own compared to Patrick Wilson. Nothing against Wilson, but his part was mainly reacting to Page's actions. The sick, warped plot was very well-made and I could even see it being a bit longer to include more exposition. David Slade's cinematographic style is great, especially his red motifs and tracking shots. While it might be a rough watch for some people, it's still a fantastic psychological film.",Hard Candy

The acting is great and it plays well as a thriller. The problem is it is very morally ambiguous. The Hayley character is a full blown sociopath. Any way you look at it she is totally insane. There is very little doubt in my mind she is a serial killer in the making. She isn't seeking justice. She's reveling in torturing someone, taunting and psychologically abusing them. Her justification for all she's done at the end feels very shallow and her breaking of a promise drives the point home. It sort of defeats the purpose to have a morally ambiguous movie about morals. So what do we learn, a clever sociopath can kick a could be pedophile's ass? Well done cinematically but a very strange and uncomfortable viewing experience.",Hard Candy
159,howie73,Worst film of the year,1,3 November 2006,"This tasteless and smug ""psychological thriller"" has been the subject of many rave reviews by critics who have little knowledge of what film actually is. Hard Candy thinks its daring and contemporary with its slick MTV visuals, but it resembles an advert more than a film in its self-conscious stylised mis en scene. But Hard Candy doesn't want to be shallow. It wants to be intellectual. And what do you get? A ""heroine"" who is as morally reprehensible as her victim. A heroine who spouts references and smart talk beyond her years. This just doesn't wash. Hayley, if we can call her that, is not really a character; she is a just a mouthpiece for Brian Nelson's pretentious dialogue. Her self-satisfied talk is annoying and unconvincing and is part of the reason why Hard Candy is such an astonishing failure of a film  a fact supported by its dismal Box Office performance. Hayley is simply not a sympathetic character and neither is Jeff, and the film's penchant for ambiguity further clouds any sense of background and motive that might justify what is happening in this trashy, faux art-house film. The film also has no sense of irony and subtlety: Nelson could have made points about the hypocrisy of Hayley and the role-reversals she undertakes but that would have disrupted the smug dialogue.Hard Candy is also one of the most implausible films committed to celluloid. I am not convinced why Hayley did what she did; how far she planned everything to the last detail and what her motives were. The film barely explains why she did what she did, save the stilted dialogue at the end which further reinforces the film's desperation to be ambiguous. Even the brief appearance by Sandra Oh as the inquisitive neighbour is an embarrassment. Why didn't she ask about the blood on Hayley's forehead? The script is to busy being smart to gloss over such inconsistencies. The acting is also very annoying, especially Ellen Page, who was a bit one-dimensional in her role. Avoid this nasty, amoral little film.",Hard Candy
160,dave-sturm,Ellen Page is a force to deal with,8,23 February 2008,"May include spoilers.I haven't seen Juno yet, but I've heard the buzz about Ellen Page. Saw this in Blockbuster and said, what the hey. I had heard it was an edgy film. Edgy I like.Nothing I had heard prepared me for this. I was totally taken off guard. I love when movies go in a direction when you cannot figure what will happen next. This does.Other reviewers have given the plot. A 14-year-old girl hooks up online with a 32-year-old photographer who may or may not be a pedophile. The whole movie is about the confrontation in his swanky home/studio, most of the time during which she keeps him tied up and helpless.I honestly did not know where this movie was going. Is she some kind of twisted vigilante? Is he an honest guy who just happens to make a living shooting young models?The tension that develops while you, the audience, are trying to sort out certain clues that for a while favor one side, then the other, are riveting. He's tied down and helpless, she's wielding sharp weapons ... what to believe? Is she nuts? Is he a dangerous pervert?The two characters and their interaction are almost the entire movie. While I credit Patrick Wilson's great performance as a man trying to save his own life by talking his way out of her murderous determination, Ellen Page is astonishing. She lets you into her head  as a woman on a mission to avenge pedophile victims, even though she's a very young teenager  in a way rarely seen. Her face is mesmerizing. Critics of this movie are right on a certain level. How could a 14-year-old girl possess this level of sophistication.? How could an adult male allow himself to fall victim so easily? Suspension of disbelief is important here for the movie to work.Yet, Hard Candy delivers. Movies are to be judged on how you, the audience, responds. You will respond to this movie. It reminded me a bit of Mamet's Oleanna, another male-female confrontation movie in which violence is a central element.Bottom line: the ruthlessness of Ellen Page's character is so profoundly shown that it all works. She is a force to be reckoned with. Can't wait to see what she does after Juno. Go Ellen!",Hard Candy
161,MattBirk,One of the Most Tense Movies of the past Decade! Amazing!,8,17 March 2016,"Again, Hard Candy is another movie where it is hard to review without giving too much of the plot away and spoiling some of the surprises. The movie features only the two leads (Patrick Wilson & Ellen Page) for 95% of the movie as they battle one another and they couldn't have been any better! Acting aside, the story is super effective, a child tracking down a pedophile and dishing out her own justice, it's a dark and terrifying tale of vengeance. The movie is great at keeping you in the dark as to whether the main character is guilty or not, establishes sympathy for our tormented hero.The only downside to the movie would have to be its final 5-6 minutes, where the movie relies heavily on the involvement of Jeff's love interest, Janelle, yet the whole storyline didn't seem to make a ton of sense. I just didn't like how Jeff's decision-making and actions were basically controlled by the outside character of Janelle whom we never truly meet. But other than those final minutes of the film, the 'Hard Candy' is one hell of a thrill ride that will surely get your heart pumping, that is if you can buy into it.So if you are looking for something shocking and suspenseful, but without the violence and gore of today's horror movies, Hard Candy is definitely something you should consider!",Hard Candy
162,rabbitmoon,Awful film - don't believe the naiveté of some reviewers,2,6 August 2006,"Independent cinema offers some real treats. Following, Primer & Dead Mans Shoes are some my favourites - proving that low budgets can create intelligent, thought provoking cinema. But Hard Candy is NEITHER of these. Instead it jumps on the bandwagon of trying to create word-of-mouth with a ridiculous, contrived and wallowingly self-conscious 'sicko' scene. Since Reservoir Dogs, many low budget indie filmmakers still think its original and clever to throw a few people into a room, and torture them (also Saw). Many reviewers have commented on Hard Candy being 'daring' or 'contempary' in dealing with the 'taboo' of paedophilia. Is it me or is this subject getting more attention than it really deserves in cinema? It has become an easy target for anyone wanting to inject their film with 'importance'. Hard Candy simply USES it. It certainly doesn't fit well with a film that tries to be clever in terms of changing who you support throughout the film. The overall effect, especially after the final revelations, is that the whole thing simply cancels itself out so you don't care at all. And when you learn the true motives and intentions of the characters, the first half of the film makes little sense.I'd also like to comment on the acting of Ellen Page - just because a young actress has so much dialogue and gets to pout and shout a lot DOES NOT MAKE HER A GREAT ACTRESS. Its the part that many female teenagers could play, and probably do in their school drama lessons. Her performance was unrealistic, self-conscious and lacked any true range of sensitivity or inner conflict. It was just a string of cringey one liners ('Play time is over!') and dull sarcasm.This film could have been MUCH BETTER if it used the template of Swimming With Sharks - inter-cutting a home kidnapping/torture with flashbacks of a back-story to give it depth and a greater sense of cinema. Instead, it is more like boring theatre.If you have any brains, and want to see a film worth the huge cost of going to the cinema - Don't SEE HARD CANDY!!",Hard Candy
163,Hawkensian,"The film's tightly-wound tension is spoilt by another of Ellen Page's irritating, arrogant performances and a variety of narrative issues and implausibilities.",6,11 September 2012,"In every Ellen Page film I have seen, her character is an infuriatingly smug, precocious, androgynous pain in the arse, and 'Hard Candy' is no different. In fact, it's worse, her painfully irritating screen presence is accentuated by her total dominance in the film, she's even more unbearable than she was in the ironically titled 'Super'. When I realised her performance was going in this familiar loathsome direction, I almost stopped watching it, but I found the strength to continue. It started strongly, the first 20 minutes of 'Hard Candy' are genuinely creepy and unsettling, mostly because of the ambiguity of the situation. It's also here that Ellen Page is actually very good, she's natural and only adds to the tension, she can give likable performances after all. However, it swiftly descends into a stressful, frustrating ordeal of a film. My main problem with it was that throughout Hayley's antagonisation of Jeff, he isn't a confirmed paedophile or threat. Jeff is actually a character one can empathise with. He's clearly morally dubious, he has crossed the line in his contact with Hayley, but he seems to realise this - 'Look. I've been lonely, okay? And that makes me stupid, but I am not a paedophile.' Is Jeff saying that as a way out? What were his intentions before things turned against him? I didn't know, but his innocence seemed credible, which made the majority of the film seem to be unjustified, sadistic torture committed by an irrational, evil and maddeningly arrogant psychopath. Another of the film's problems is straightforward implausibility. 5ft 1 Ellen Page, who looks like she must weigh under 100lbs, somehow gets Patrick Wilson in all sorts of predicaments which are simply impossible. The film can just about convince us of her dexterity with rope, but not that she can support Wilson's bodyweight to such a laughable extent. Though 'Hard Candy' is undeniably powerful and gripping, it is unfortunately spoilt by Ellen Page and narrative issues.www.hawkensian.com",Hard Candy
164,edwardrevans,Truly exceptional,10,2 May 2011,"A truly exceptional and brilliant movie, Hard Candy is difficult to describe in any other words. A delicate and difficult subject matter is taken and twisted from the conventional thought who we the audience think is the victim, because the tables are well and truly turned in favour of a young girl who terrorises a paedophile for the majority of the movie. The shock/surprise here is that its totally unexpected as we have a prejudged idea in our heads as we enter the cinema on how a movie will pan out. With only really two principle actors in front of the camera for the majority of the film dialogue is the key here and its works with an aplomb twisting an turning the tension to a quick and audience pleasing ending.",Hard Candy

The acting is fantastic and the slow build up and tension is amazing.Ellen Page plays a precocious teenager who pretends to be interested in a man she knows to be a perv only to shock you with the ultimate plan of revenge and punishment. She basically convinces him to lure himself to his own home so she can proceed to deal out his just deserts. Patrick Wilson's reveal of his true monstrous nature from the charming (yet still creepy) guy is done seamlessly. Very tense, edge of your seat cat and mouse movie. Excellent movie.",Hard Candy
166,Robert_Hearth,"""Nothing's Yours When You Invite A Teenager Into Your Home."" --- Haley Stark (Ellen Page)",10,13 November 2006,"""Hard Candy"" (2005) Directed By: David Slade Starring: Patrick Wilson, Ellen Page, Sandra Oh, & Jennifer Holmes MPAA Rating: ""R"" (for disturbing violent and aberrant sexual content involving a teen, and for language) ""Hard Candy"" is a surprisingly powerful little cinematic gem. I had heard many positive things about the film prior to my viewing, but I still didn't expect anything out of the ordinary. To my surprise, ""Hard Candy"" packed a whopping, yet subtle punch that knocked my socks off and left me with my mouth dangling open and my eyes wide. Spectacular performances and a beautiful, yet strangely sinister, style highlight the film's impressive and deeply involving plot.Haley Stark (Page) is an intelligent, mature fourteen-year-old who spends her time reading advanced novels and studying medical textbooks. For being so young, Haley seems to have an understanding of the world, more profound than most people twice her age. Jeff Kohlver (Wilson) is a successful photographer who hangs portraits of his underage models all over his stylish, upscale apartment. He seems like a perfectly normal, handsome man. The two meet on the internet and, over a three week span, forge a seemingly harmless friendship. Then, the two meet and go back to Jeff's apartment for an innocent afternoon of discussion. But, a smart girl like Haley would surely expect any ulterior motives that Jeff may haveunless, of course, she has ulterior motives of her own.The performances are absolutely amazing, especially the one given by relative newcomer, Ellen Page. Page is probably best known for her role as Kitty Pryde in ""X-Men: The Last Stand"". Surprisingly enough, that performance is not her best. Page gives a mesmerizing and deeply haunting performance, bringing humanity to a character that could have been cheesy and over-the-top. The subtlety she displays makes the part all the more effective. Patrick Wilson also gives his best performance to date, but in a much different way. He is emotional, loud, energetic, and yet still just as involving. Sandra Oh, one of my favorite actresses, also did a great jobbut I couldn't help but wondering why she was given such a limited part. It was obvious that she liked the script and wanted to be involved. I am sure that the filmmakers were more than happy to cast such a big name in their film. Jennifer Holmes, much like Sandra Oh, was given an almost nonexistent part, but she does what is required of her, nonetheless.On the slight downside (and I do stress the word, ""slight""), the film is a little too long and it definitely needed a few cutsyou know, just to keep the ball rolling a little faster. Sandra Oh is also almost completely wasted and her inclusion seemed more like an attempt to cash in on her success in ""Grey's Anatomy"" by the filmmakers who wanted to draw in general audiences. The ending could have also been a little more complete. But, overall, the good definitely outweighs the bad and I didn't even really notice said problems until after the movie was over. Fortunately, they didn't really deduct from the overall quality of the film. How could they, when I was so completely bowled over by its intensity and control? When ""Hard Candy"" ended, I felt weak and worn-out. It was a film that did not need to show sexual content, excessive violence, or heavy gore to make a huge impact. We didn't need to see the pornography in Jeff's apartment to resent him for having it. We did not need to see ""The Scene"" (that I will not spoil) to cringe in disgust. ""Hard Candy"" knows the art of implication--something that most horror films do not comprehend at all. Yet do not think that the lack of violence and/or gore weakens the movie. The implication of it is just as hard-hitting as watching it straight-forward. When everything was said and done, I cannot consider ""Hard Candy"" anything less than one of the best thrillers so far this year. Engrossing, vivid, and emotionally-powerful are the best adjectives that I can use to describe it. It is truly a must-see movie.Final Thought: ""Hard Candy"" implies much of its violence and gore, but that doesn't stop it from being an intensely effective and deeply disturbing thriller.Overall Rating: 10/10 (A+)",Hard Candy
167,rarepeperonis,Good movie,7,19 June 2020,First 45 minutes are very good then the movie drags a bit too long. Some scenes go and go and go and you just want it to be finished already.

168,manicman84,psychological thriller with strong performances and intelligent script,9,11 August 2006,"Hard Candy is a psychological thriller which proves that American independent filmmakers are in a great form. The film has so many strengths that I even don't know with which I should start. It's hard to believe that the director and leading actress are newcomers as their outstanding work and total commitment are clearly visible here. Ellen Page stars as a bright, overly self-assured 14-year-old Hayley who wants to debunk and punish a presumable pedophile, Jeff (ambiguous Patrick Wilson). Thus, the link between hunter and prey is completely reversed. Owing to the fact that viewers don't even know whether Jeff is guilty or not till the very end, the film is much more compelling. As the movie depends upon two main characters and their mutual interaction, the acting should be good. Hard Candy is far from failure in this respect. What's more, the acting is really sensational. Particularly, Ellen Page's role is one of the best female performances in years. Her magnetic performance is yet a good reason to see this film. The writing is another virtue. Brian Nelson's intelligent script is abound with surprising twists, dark humor and bitter exchanges which will provoke discussions after the screening. David Slade directs with feeling and the flick keeps in heart-pounding suspense. To conclude, Hard Candy offers a great deal in comparison to other movies produced nowadays and, consequently, deserves more attention.",Hard Candy
169,TheGOLDENWALRUS,such a hard film to watch but very well done for the most part,9,27 September 2006,"Never have I ever had such a hard time watching a film in my life. This film (especially guys) will have your heart pounding pretty much from start to end. One of the most original thrillers that I have ever seen.Ellen Page was incredible as she played a harmless under-aged girl that pretends to get seduced by a thirty-something photographer. She was one crazy girl as she turned halfway through the movie as a very dark little girl. Patrick Wilson was also very good and it's a shame that he has to compete with Ellen Page. He tried using his charm to get out of awful situations that Ellen Page's character put him in. The only flaw about this movie was the ending but at the same time it was clever and very disturbing and controversial.This film is only for a small group of people. I consider it the hardest to watch film in years and the amazing part is there really wasn't any blood or gore in it! You'll know what I'm talking about. This should at least be the most controversial film since SAW 1 but I think it's more than that.Acting a 10, editing 9, storyline 7, directing 9.",Hard Candy
170,Minerva_Meybridge,Psychopathic Psycho Drama,7,12 July 2010,"Take Sleuth, Wolf Creek and Texas Chainsaw Massacre and you have Hard Candy—edgy, with two clever, despicable characters, the whole nauseatingly gruesome, with sympathy going to the bad guy, wishing the heroine would die. Then 17-year-old Page plays a 14-year-old, smart well beyond her years. But in this Misery-esquire script of torture, she reminds us of a teenage Kathy Bates, even in her looks. Patrick Wilson plays a photographer, who may or may not have been a child molester/murderer. Yet even at the end, we are left in bewilderment as to who Page's character, Hayley, really is, and how does she know so much about the crime? Everything is planned to perfection. She is Alice, leading the White Rabbit down his own rabbit hole. What is her motivation for her elaborate machinations? A science project? Was she the victim's sister? In the final analysis, we are asked to cheer on vigilante justice, exacted from, by her own admission, a child.

171,the_Poppuns,I was upset for most of this movie,9,9 March 2007,"If you haven't seen this film yet, stop reading this comment and go rent it. I'm going to get into major spoilers and it's the kind of movie you should know next to nothing about before seeing it. If you're an adult who can handle adult topics, because some adults can't, then I would definitely have to insist that you watch this ASAP. Now shoo.Okay from the beginning Hayley (played by Ellen Page) bothered me immensely. All I could think was 'who is this kid and WHAT is her deal?' She was just so grating I wanted to go into the film and strangle her myself. Really. I guess my problem was that I didn't think Jeff had done anything. Maybe it's because I'm a Patrick Wilson fan, but I just thought he was mildly pervy. She looked like a young woman who could easily pass for early 20s. She was intelligent beyond her years so I could see a slightly pervy guy getting caught in that kind of trap. And she was definitely trapping him. We find out later why, and I think it was hinted to in the very beginning, but I personally was still on Jeff's side at that point. And I've watched the special features so I know at least one of the filmmakers think people who did are sickos of some sort. But let me say this. I'm a 33 year old female. In my early 20s people thought I looked 12 if I didn't have make-up on. But as a teenager if I wore makeup I looked as old as I am now. So I personally have a difficult time hating adult men who are attracted to teenagers who look like young adult women. I think it's a tricky grey area. Once they know the facts they should back off, but I think the idea that most men would is fantasy. And I don't think that teenage girls are completely blameless when they play games with older men. Sorry. I know that's not the right answer, but that's where I stand.Okay so after the movie's over you know that that's really not the issue here. But for most of the movie, you don't know that. And I didn't. I didn't think Jeff was guilty until he said so. And then when he did I was like 'huh, what?' My stomach had been tied up in knots to that point mostly because I had been hating Hayley for the entire film. So now what? I don't know. I spent the last 5-10 minutes with fuzzy brain. So that fact alone, to me, says this is a great movie. And you can't feel as strongly as I did about the events in the film if something was off because everyone had to be firing on all cylinders. And they were. The fact that I was rooting for Jeff so strongly, and against Hayley so strongly, make me wonder who actually gave the better performance. They were both awesome. If you've read this far you should have already seen it. If not shame on you, and will you please go rent it now?",Hard Candy
172,tecnogaming,Extremely painful and disturbing,4,15 May 2014,"What starts as an interesting thriller for a girl following a big guy who is maybe a pedophile soon becomes gross and disturbing show of torture for the victim.I don't know which is worse, if Ellen Page voice or her psychopath character. Her view of life is cold, she is incredible disturbed and shows no remorse whatsoever.Is revenge justified?, that's the main topic.The movies is good for anyone who enjoys torture but its not even remotely recommended for people that still has normal brain functions.I can understand how this is a movie about revenge but the little girl is really a psycho and is almost as dangerous as the victim.I get the idea, but I usually don't go to see movies to get educated about topics, for that I see documentaries, I see movies to relax and disconnect from everyday problems, not to see disturbed people in bad situations. If you want to see horror, you'll be better off with a horror movie.The acting is great but the topic is sick. If you really enjoy seeing torture or you somehow feels rage and need to see violent scenes, then by all means go see this movie, but I would recommend going to the therapist first.",Hard Candy
173,Anyanwu,This was not a good movie,3,25 January 2007,"I think whenever dialogue in a film is acerbic or sarcastic in the vain of CSI it's not a good movie. It's that type of cute, witty script that turned me off from that original CSI. In fact the female character sounded like Jorja Fox, from the aforementioned TV show, and her quick repartee compounded the irritation. Fourteen year old girl has all the angles figured out. Thirty two year old man is a ""tool"". He's able to escape only after the supposed ""surgical deed"" has occurred. Has opportunity to escape and/or call police, doesn't and attempts to take things into his own hands and deal with the child on his own. Gets duped again and finds himself in a hangman's noose, that has been expertly configured by the highly intellectual and very strong 80lb Fourteen year old girl. Implausible. The pedophile is the character you cheer for and you want to kill the Fourteen year old. She's endlessly philosophical and witty about why she is doing this and throughout the whole process ""psychologically"" breaking him down. ""I am every little girl you ever watched, touched, hurt..."" That kind of dialogue is just too cliché. At 9minutes and 34 seconds into this thing I didn't like her and was waiting for the end. She was too smart and witty for a fourteen year old. The film went on and on and there was not much thrill at all. Hand held camera shots a la music vidoes don't thrill me either. These Sundance Lab projects tend to get a lot of hype but end up so disappointing. See the Woodsman for film on pedophilia.",Hard Candy
174,cheer88,"Pedophile version of ""Fatal Attraction""",8,30 October 2015,"There are two disturbing people in this movie Jeff and Hayley. Jeff is a pedophile and Hayley is a psychopath. They two facilitated a perfect storm. One could not do without the other.Like Roger Ebert's review said the success of this movie is it's done without nudity and sex. However, the chill and thrill stayed with the audience. I still remembered details in the movie after viewing it more than a year ago. It's crippling, devious and dark. There are unforgivable acts and punishments in this movie. Freedom of speech has its contributions to this great country. However, it also allows the exploitation of human's dark minds. So there are boundaries being set by the legal systems and deemed necessarily. How effectively justices have been carried out we don't know. But we somehow live in the fear of its own making.What the chance is pedophiles meet genius psychopaths in real life. It's probably non-existed. But it's not what the director wanted us to think. He only provided it as a vehicle for us to see what the pedophile is. The thrill and chill were the effects came with it. It's a good movie. But I have no intention to watch it again.",Hard Candy
175,wynonasbigbrownbeaver,A candy that's hard and unforgiving.,6,28 June 2009,"Upon watching the previews of Hard Candy, I was actually intrigued by the possible concept that the teenage girl is a misguided predator / villain who preys on older innocent men. Well I was only partially correct about it. When I rented this movie at the iTunes store, the brief synopsis labels this as a ""game of Cat and Mouse"". I disagree with that statement. From what I saw in Hard Candy, it was more like a one-sided SOFT torture porn sequence, in which the would be ""mouse"" is practically bound to a chair or a table in 90 percent of the film. I know the motive of this production was supposed to be psychological rather than action so I nearly agonized myself in watching this movie throughout its entirety.14 year old Haley is suspecting that 32 year old Jeff is a pedophile, and I must admit that it was interesting how she uses many mind tricks to get Jeff to ""crack"" or give into a self- incriminating confession, whether it is true or not. The ending is still very much open to debate at this point.From what I gathered in Hard Candy, the script tried to impel me to feel sorry for the seemingly harmless ""Jeff"" character, who is constantly being psychologically tortured by this girl to the point where his genitalia is put into jeopardy if he doesn't confess to whatever he actually did in the past. I personally think he is a dumb-ass for inviting a teenage girl over to his house for alcohol, but that's just me. That's open to debate too. Another point on ""Jeff"" is that he still a complex character to this day of writing this review, the audience only scratches the surface and there are many unanswered questions about his secret life. Yes, he is guilty of something, and there is debate on whether he admitted to killing her friend, or he was just in enraged into saying this. That part I felt need some closure. We never receive full justification on how it ended. He seems contradictory to his supposed demons, and it fascinates me and confuses me at the same time. Over all the ""Jeff"" character was well played by Patrick Wilson despite the confusions implied in his script.As for the ""Haley"" character. Ellen Page nicely portrays an unforgiving teenager who is indeed clever and crafty in her way to psychologically manipulate people. The message of Hard Candy is that it goes to show anyone regardless of size and age that can becoming psychologically overpowering of another. My biggest gripe falls into the film leaves me wondering to this day. How did a skinny 90 pound Haley physically lift her 200 pound victim and neatly prop him on a table, and neatly prop him on the chair standing up, (especially if Jeff has been resistant the entire way through)? I know, I know the rope is shown but I think it takes a little more than rope, and her victim's sedation since she needs a little more leverage than that. Direction should have at least show her methods of mayhem. The castration table scenario is far fetched enough, but the part in which in which she's got him hanged standing up on the chair is very incomprehensible. The overall ""how"" of this movie was a bit unintelligible, but this movie still delivers a message. By the time the ending approached, I almost wound up disliking this movie for being too one sided and made me wanting a little more conflict from ""Jeff"". But I do commend the movie for successfully being an ""indie"" movie. I still recommend it, despite its technical flaws.",Hard Candy
176,beregic,"tough sensations but in the end just as ""sick ""as all its characters",4,10 May 2008,"took me a while to get around this one and the perversity on display included. it will not be long before a teenager will attempt to find himself/herself in a similar situation displayed here.just picturing what dangerous incentives one could find here in creating an all out Righteous state of mind for a naturally, yet undeveloped mind( and how maturity could be affected by such course). this production succeeds only in creating an even bigger gap between how age groups and generations would perceive each other.if you are a mature person this might be an interesting watch regardless. for a mature couple this will prove controversial, when end credits start rolling. you will likely debate it for days after wards; this feature is not easy to digest and due to its conclusion, morals and ethics i can not possibly give it more then 4 stars(3 for excellent acting). at the end of the day one has to ask himself/herself if this is ""right"" or ""wrong"" based on the CIRCUMSTANTIAL evidence given(remember, in the end, what you actually see and what you are actually lead on to assume). the question is : what does this feature try to prove EXACTLY? does it offer a SOLUTION? answering this 2 question based on what one will see, will lead to the definition of perversity itself. this movie will make you think if being politically correct does or does NOT help in solving the very issues it raises.",Hard Candy
177,Oberrated,An uncomfortably great film,8,1 March 2017,"Taking on this request by my friend, Mike, I honestly had no idea what to expect from this film besides what I saw in the trailer and the small teases he fed me about the film. I remember we got on to the topic of 'Hard Candy' as we were talking about Patrick Wilson in 'The Conjuring' series. That conversation led to Patrick's acting and Mike making his claim that Patrick's performance in this is exceptional. Well, he is not wrong. Alongside of Patrick Wilson, Ellen Page does a fantastic job on her own as well. The two present themselves in equally creepy and mysterious characters that you may grow to despise or feel for. Two performances that are simply brilliant in regards to how the story plays out... Now speaking of story, my oh my did I not expect this. With no spoilers, all I can say is at the start, some may not expect the story to play out in the way it does but regardless of expecting or not, it is phenomenally done and quite a gripping story to get its viewers sunk into the film. Overall, as creative and brilliant as this film plays out to be, it was so uncomfortable for me to watch at times and that saying so in the best way possible. Thrillers or even horror films that can enact a sense of discomfort in its viewers and/or me is a film I like to see and enjoy...as odd as that sounds.'Hard Candy' is a great film given the small cast and limited setting. Patrick and Ellen can keep you invested in this film's entirety through uncomfortable curiosity. This is another Oberrated requested review that passes the test.

The only similar cruelty I can remember is what happened to Theon Baratheon in GOT.,7,23 November 2020,"Excepting the bits that completely petrify me cause of the strong visceral sensation, I liked the way the story progresses, though sometimes I felt we were told too much in a straightforward manner and other times I wish we were told more.

179,seige-hound,An interesting look into the ethics surrounding pedophilia,9,22 June 2014,"In this film we have two polar opposites clashing. Hayley is the personification of the victims and families of those who child molesters have attacked, while Jeff is the 'normal' guy with a sinister past.Just to be clear, these core things happened:1. Hayley did not castrate Jeff. It was psychological torture 2. Jeff is guilty. He confesses at the end to 'watching' the other man (who she also forced into suicide) kill the girl. 3. Hayley probably isn't actually 14. The television show 'To Catch a Predator' proves that there are plenty of 'reverse-jailbait' women out there (that is, they look younger then they actually are). Hayley is probably a vigilante who seeks out pedophiles, and it's likely she'll strike again. 4. Jeff had the chance to call 911 and get out alive. He didn't, instead he tried to attack Hayley, and that lead to his confession and suicide.I think this film is an important film, and when given some thought and discussion, is definitely good for what it is. It pits the polar opposites of the discussion (that is, outright hatred of pedophiles vs. pedophile apologists) against each other and in the end, neither is really right.It is definitely controversial, and isn't by all means a perfect or even a great movie, but it's good for what it is, and for that it should be praised.Also the cinematography was amazing.",Hard Candy

181,ChiefGoreMongral,Gore Mongral Movie Review: Hard Candy,8,21 September 2006,"Here it is another review from the master of the slasher the lord of the gore....anyway lets get right into this one fokes as I have a new movie up for review today, the Thriller, Hard Candy lets take a look.We start off with some scenes of a guy and a girl chatting on the net. Next thing you know the guy (a 30 something) is meeting the girl (a 14 year old) at a coffee shop. From there the kid goes home with him, has a few screwdrivers and just when you think the guy is about to possibly take advantage of her...the tables turn and its the guy at the mercy of this young girl.From this point of the movie (which is a little after the 20 minute mark) on, the movie begins to take us on a twisted journey into who is the real sicko, this young teenage girl who is now physically and mentally torturing this guy while ransacking his house for clues to his ""possible"" sick addictions, or the 30 year old guy who brought her to his house. Despite your early conceptions of what is going on and who is the antagonist, by the end credits they may be shattered.This movie works very well on so many levels, Thriller, Drama, Horror, Mystery and also as a movie that tackles a disturbing subject matter with the skill of a surgeon. Not to mention little things that you see or that happen earlier on play out in the movie somewhere else later on (if you paying attention). This is not your typical Thriller that is for sure. I find it very hard pressed for anyone not to get into this movie as both character studies are just so darn interesting and the conclusion is very satisfying for this viewer.In conclusion to give away anything in this movie would be a crime. One of the best I've seen this year without a doubt. Buy this, rent this, do whatever you need to just see this film. It's that good!! With a great story, great characters and great acting I proudly give Hard Candy: 8/10 Very Good, this is one movie that will get to you either by the subject matter, the mental aspect of it or the visuals!!That's it for now, remember on-line chatters, not all people are what they appear...young or old!!!

But what I got.. oh man. This is a terrifying movie and I mean it. Girls probably don't like it. More like a guys movie (except few scenes which are hard to see if you know what I mean). But it's a solid film, cause it makes a point. It accomplishes its goal which is to test your senses and give you a creepy experience.Ellen Page (Hayley) is a revelation here. She was 18 at the time of filming but played a 14-year old. You must see her performance to believe what she does there.It's shocking.

183,Michael-70,"Tense and exciting, but ultimately unbelievable and wrongheaded.",3,14 July 2006,"This is a tense two-character drama about a 14-year-old girl who becomes an avenging angel on an Internet pedophile. Using clear entrapment techniques to ferret out a particularly nasty pedophile, once the girl gets into the man's house, she drugs him, literally tortures him and then pretends to castrate him. The film ultimately ends up with the pedophile killing himself in a thoroughly unbelievable way. There are way too many holes in the film and way too many times we fade to black and then when we fade up, the fully grown adult male victim has been tied up or bound in a rope truss in a way that requires strength that would tax two full grown men. It just beggars known physics that a skinny 14-year-old girl could do this, even if she is diabolically clever. Also, we are led to believe that the girl has been focused on this particular suspect for some time; in fact, she seems to have also paid a visit to the man's former perverted partner. Well, if this teenager is able to easily track this pedophile and discover his existence, why can't the police? Once again, the police are treated as dumb asses. In reality, the police are a lot smarter than you think. If she figures out who the two guys are who were responsible for the possible murder of a missing girl we see in MIA posters everywhere, why doesn't she just notify the police, which is what would normally happen, but in this case the kid stalks the guys and then convinces them to kill themselves, which I found insultingly unrealistic. I don't know that pedophiles are that guilt ridden. Too many of these negative things occurred to me after I had watched the film, but while it was playing, I was riveted. The acting is good on all counts, but I had a hard time believing that Ellen Page, the 14-year-old girl was as witty and clever as she comes across being. Maybe I don't talk to enough 14-year-old girls, but she seems to be witty because the screenplay is written that way, not because her character would say those things. In this film everything is just too clever for its own good, but again I still was carried along and that is part of the battle in any movie. I also found the constant use of close-up shots to be a hindrance, but with only two characters, really there is not much else you can do. It might have been better to start with longer shots of the main characters and then get in close when it is really menacing. But we are in close enough to count their nose hairs from the first shots of the film through to the end. Overall, I can't endorse the film because it makes a case for vigilantism as being helpful and necessary. Maybe it is when the culprit is obviously guilty as in this movie, but in real life, it is usually the innocent person who gets hurt. That's why we don't allow family members of the victim on the jury. They are too emotionally involved. Justice must be dispassionate.",Hard Candy

185,ogdendc,Great performances but no real surprise,4,27 August 2014,"I started by thinking that this was one of those films that people either loved, or hated. Looking at the other reviews, there seemed to be a lot of ones and tens. Which would I be? Well neither actually. Yes, this is commendably economical on actors – really just Patrick Wilson as paedophile Jeff Kohlver and Ellen Page as 14 year-old bait with a bite Hayley Stark. Both give good performances. If Ellen had been Oscar-nominated for this as well as Juno, few could have complained.The plot is unusual and credit goes to writer Brian Nelson. The camera-work and direction is excellent and David Slade is clearly a talented guy. I'm not going to go through the plot in detail but you know by now what it boils down to. Jeff is grooming kids on the internet. One is willing to meet him, but it turns out Hayley was actually grooming him and in a battle between a 30-year old man and a 14 year-old girl the winner is not the one you would expect in real life, but in a movie...well it probably is the one you would expect. So there was no real surprise element for me.Also, I didn't like the ending, and I thought the castration scene was far too drawn out. But my main problem with it was that I didn't like either of the characters and they comprised nearly 100% of the film. I didn't like Jeff because of what he was. But I didn't like Hayley either. She was just too smart, too cold, too flawless. I would have liked some major plot twist but nothing came. So in the end I give it a disappointed four.",Hard Candy
186,Lele,In Italy it's forbidden to underage people,7,19 January 2015,"Yesterday I went and watch American Sniper. There are tons of blood, scenes of death and tortured people, war and horrific sounds of all kind of guns. There is even a detailed sequence of a children killed by the sniper! Anyone could enter the theater, even a 7 year old child with his popcorn and cola. Hard Candy it is forbidden to underage people, here in Italy, which sounds CRAZY to me. Hard Candy is a MUST SEE movie for teens! I'd like to watch it with my high school students, but we can't.The movie is great for acting, for strength and for directing. It can be the starting point for many discussions: is it moral self-made justice? Do guilty people deserve death or should they be corrected? Is Hayley a psycho?",Hard Candy
187,NileFortnerBoogieBuddha954,Great Thriller,7,10 July 2016,"""Crazy 14 year old just cut off my balls!"" Just when you thought teenage girls couldn't get any scarier, you come across the film Hard Candy. I actually have never heard of this film before. It was recommended to me, and I happened to come across it on Hulu, and finally decided to watch it. I am glad I came across it, and I think you'll be glad you came across this movie as well.Hayley, a teenage girl, played by Ellen Page (Juno, Inception) agrees to meet a thirty something year old, played by Patrick Wilson (Watchmen, The Conjuring), who is a fashion photographer. The two met in an online chat room, and the encounter of a predator meets the prey makes for an interesting story. But, as the film goes on, we ask ourselves who is the predator, and who is the prey? The film builds up some pretty good tension. I believe, that from the first scene, the viewer automatically feels uncomfortable. We really do get a fluster of nerves in our gut, from that opening scene. We do not know what to expect, and as the film goes on it becomes an interesting concept of cat and mouse. This one film really is a mixed bag of different genres in one movie. We get a drama, thriller, horror, mystery, and a psychological thriller. This is a good example of different genres mixing together, to tell one good story.This movie may have a simple premise, but it's gigantic on great performances. After seeing Ellen Page in this, and seeing her in other films, such as Juno. I believe Ellen Page is not only a great actress now, but will be a great actress for years and years to come. She plays the role so well, and honestly I found her quite scary. For instance, there is one scene, where it involves Jeff tied to a steel table, with his genitals on ice, and Hayley saying she will castrate him (you do the math). Ellen Page is literally Jigsaw from the Saw horror movies, when it comes to Patrick Wilson's balls. Even though that may sound pleasing to some people, Ellen Page's performance had me gasping, sweating, and frightened.Even though there are not a lot of locations throughout this film, they make the best of the one location. I like how in Jeff's home, the pictures he had on his walls from his fashion photography work, kinda said something about his possible personality. If you really look at them. Similarly, there is a scene in the movie at 1 hour and 20 minute mark. Where Hayley is hanging up a picture, of a young woman looking at a window. However, the window is covered by curtains. I personally take that as, maybe the character Hayley wants a way out, to see the truth in front of her, but can't.So these are my final Bitchin' Buddha thoughts on the film Hard Candy. Hard Candy is good nail biting film. That really has you pulled in from the very first scene. The film is very dialogue heavy. Meaning if you are the kind of person who isn't into a lot of characters talking, and more about characters doing, this film may not be for you. Personally, I didn't mind all the talk between the characters. I believe Hard Candy earns a..7/10this review is brought to you by Boogie Buddha, and remember, don't just get down, but get Boogie. Thank you for reading and viewing, and I hope you all have an amazing day as always. :)",Hard Candy
188,pcsarkar,Gross,2,7 July 2012,"OK.. so here is the 576th review. Came across this gem of a movie yesterday, and watched it in 2 sittings i.e. (1) Before Jeff was tied up and (2) After he was tied up. LOL. Such ambiguous films often make me ponder as to why they are made at all. For profits? For a social message? For the director / producer's own voyeuristic leanings? Under illusions of grandeur? Or just for the heck of it? Anywaz.The lead character is a fresher version of Woody Harrelson, and the nymphet is like any other motor-mouth teenager, we come across these days. The film lacks a consistent sound-track and the dialogs between the 2, without break, can be mind-numbing. The film abounds in ambiguities, for example, Jeff had umpteen chances to run off from the crazy Ms Hayley, but he didn't. In the last scene, Jeff is lying on the roof, Hayley is bending over him closely, no gun in sight, and I was just waiting for Jeff to pack a punch on the chin of li'l Ms Crusader. Instead, he reaches across, touches her forehead tenderly, and proceeds to hang himself. A weak nincompoop. In another totally unrelated scene, a chinky neighbour appears and verbally hassles Hayley. I was thinking that Ms Judy had already called the police and was just buying time, but she walks off and that was that. Anywaz, again.Coming to the premise of the plot, we have an alleged pedophile, and we have a self-appointed honey trap, who flashes her charms at the dude. OK. So one crime can be prevented by another? Can a girl acting like a whore, be excused for her actions, just because she is a minor? In law, there is a term called enticement, and if a person falls for the charms of a enticer, there is no way that a conviction can follow, because you just can't tempt someone to commit a crime, and then accuse him of committing that crime. I have no sympathy for pedophiles. I also have no sympathy for nymphets, who flash their sexual charms at adults, and when accosted, yell 'rape'. But then, that's what I believe. Not what Mr David Slade or Mr Brian Nelson believe. They believe that if a sexual deviant is operating somewhere, another mentally disturbed person, can act vigilante and bump him off. The world would soon cease to exist, if such an eye-for-an-eye and tooth-for-a-tooth game operated.I voted 2/10. Its an ordeal to sit through this pretentious piece of film making. Beware, all you out there!!",Hard Candy
189,varundelpiero,"Tasteless, pointless; nothing more than an overly dramatic revenge flick...",6,3 December 2008,"At the centre of HARD CANDY (no pun intended) is the burning question: Whose side are you on? The sick, manipulative, and twisted pedophile, or the sadistic, unnecessarily cruel, and psychotic sociopath? Either way, you, the viewer, lose, so what's the point, right? I mean, any film that almost compels the neutral viewer to support the pedophile is just tasteless and baseless. This film is completely biased, and is essentially a sadistic revenge flick catered only to those who have been affected adversely by pedophiles. I will not try to spoil the ending, because, let's face it, there is nothing to spoil. The movie is predictable and cheesy and the ending is of no consequence.Then there's this: if viewers are supposed to believe that a petite fourteen year old girl is capable of such things, then at the very least, she should have the power to consent to sexual intercourse, right? I'm not taking sides or suggesting anything of an immoral or grotesque nature, but the movie is quite contradictory in the sense that a mere fourteen year old is capable of devising and implementing such horrific and well-thought plans, which makes her essentially seem as an adult, and which ruins the whole message the movie was supposed to convey.Perhaps David Slade should stick to five-minute music videos, as a full length feature is well beyond his capacity.And, for the record, what was the point of Sandra Oh? This has to be one of the more pointless and awkward cameos I have ever seen. And I actually admire Sandra Oh.There are a few good things though: the story actually plays out properly (in a cinematic/screenplay sense only, though it gets weaker and less watchable as it progresses), the character interaction is absorbing, and the acting is top-notch (Patrick Wilson is awesome in this film; Ellen Page is quite annoying and sickening but does her job well). But really, what was the point? There were so many questions left unanswered that there was no genuine catharsis. The so-called ending is cheap and rather blunt and purposeless.I think 4/10 is a generous score. This film gets 2 stars (out of 4; also generous). Even if I made a Top 1000, this film would not come close to making the cut. Recommended only for viewers who have been affected by pedophiles. Everyone else will feel robbed of their time. I was expecting much better seeing as a trustworthy source recommended this; I will now take future recommendations from this source with a pinch of salt.David Slade, you suck. This movie sucked. I had planned to watch your latest feature, 30 DAYS OF NIGHT, but I may just make a pass. Go back to music videos. I actually enjoyed STP's 'Sour Girl' video...",Hard Candy
190,Healing_Process,This movie made me -facepalm-,4,8 September 2010,"I would give it a 1/10, but I do admit the visuals for a low budget movie and the acting was actually quite good. but when you have all that with a horrible plot, or better yet a hard-to-achieve plot, that was horribly executed.You get talented chickens running around with their heads cut off.When she questioned him about why he treated girls of older age differently then her under different screen names. That is where the movie started to get out of hand to me. You don't rely on someone being untruthful on the internet as evidence. Hope you know Mr.director, guys on the internet will tell a different dick size to each girl on the internet and probably tell each one different of what they do for a living. Its the damn internet. The fact that a good, more then half of the movie was a charming man arguing with a precocious young girl that he was a pedophile or not just made me think, well obviously this dude has to be one. no one goes out their way to trick you, meet you, and then castrate you for something they ""think"" you are. The morals of this movie was slightly skewed and didn't make a whole lot of logical sense. It was just assumptions and theories thrown out at both the characters like, ""all men delete their kiddy porn after seeing"". OMG,*gasp* that is so true little girl. You are so correct you probably now work for Chris Hansen.The fact that the movie went no where and forced itself to have unnecessary events for an insignificant conclusion really killed it for me.

191,petersj-2,do we feel sorry for the right person,4,25 April 2007,"The acting is great. The problem I have with this movie is that it is so disturbing that it is almost impossible to watch. The movie almost made me rethink censorship. No I do not think it should be banned but it came pretty dam close. Ellen Page as Halyley gives a powerful performance. Technically there is nothing wrong with the film. The Hayley character is a problem.I hated her, indeed she comes pretty close to being one of the most evil characters I have seen in film. This disturbs me because when you think about it its not meant to be like this. Patrick Wlson as Jeff, the pedophile,(or was he) extracts so much sympathy for the character that you actually start hoping he will give the evil little brat her come uppance. I am sure the director did not intend this and thats why I think the film fails. It does teach the lesson that it is wrong and repugnant to take the law into your own hands. Fine acting is not enough because in the end we have a snuff movie which fails in its goals, despite fine intention. Some may think it a brave film; I guess it is. But in the end its porn, dark porn.",Hard Candy
192,jmerlino,Bad writing ruins an interesting premise,3,25 November 2020,"Get the plot and details from other reviewers. All I want to say is this:The writing in this movie is terrible. Haley is not even remotely believable as a 14-year-old, and we get very little insight into her character. Jeff, the pedophile, is far more sympathetic, and I actually found myself rooting for him, which, I'm sure, is not what the filmmakers intended.As soon as Haley changes from her cute, innocent act into the revenge (prevenge?) monster, her character goes to hell. We don't hear Haley when she talks, we hear the screenwriter. And her disgust with Jeff seems to be just a hodgepodge of any kind of invective you'll see spewed at pedophiles on, say, Twitter.Which sucks, because Ellen Page is a terrific actress, and handled in the inane dialog she was given with great skill. And it also sucks because the premise is actually interesting. I don't believe that a 14-year-old could pull that off by herself, but she could have served as bait for someone who COULD have pulled it off. Now that I'm thinking about it, there are any number of directions this film could have gone which would have both made it a better film, and preserved the message.Speaking of the message: The only people in the world with any kind of sympathy for pedophiles are other pedophiles. If the message is simply ""pedophilia is bad"" then it's a banal message. On the other hand, if the message is, ""it's heroic for someone to torture and kill someone because they're a pedophile"" then it's a terrible message. Again, some insight into Haleys character would have helped here.Here's how I would have plotted it: Haley and Jeff meet, they go to Jeff's house. Unbeknownst to Jeff, they are being followed by Haley's father. Jeff had previously molested another girl, who turns out to be Haley's sister. The father stays hidden while Haley does all the stuff we see in the movie. At some point Jeff overpowers Haley, and then the dad comes in, and we have - and this is the important part - a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ENDING, wherein Jeff gets his comeuppance, and so does the father, and we end on Haley in a psychologist's office talking about what happened. This would allow Haley to really be a 14-year-old girl, and it would also give us a real motivator for why all of this is happening.I gave it three stars because it was pretty skillfully executed, and Page, while having to deal with ridiculous material, manages to turn in a reasonably good performance while doing it. (No, I don't think she was brilliant, like some of the other reviews say. She was very good. She was better in Juno.)",Hard Candy
193,EdYerkeRobins,"Starts Great, Quickly Falls Apart",4,1 May 2006,"Is it safe to use the phrase ""grindhouse chic""? With a slew of DVD releases and pastiches from the likes of Quentin Tarantino and Eli Roth, the mythic cycle of independent, ultra-low-budget exploitation remains en vogue well into the Oughts. Most neo-grindhouse product pays homage to the excessive sex and violence of b-action, horror, and nudies, all but ignoring the number of tight, subversive thrillers that also unspooled on the Deuce. In the tradition of the latter comes Hard Candy, a promising story that unexpectedly goes soft.Hard Candy is at its dingiest from the outset. Hayley, 14, and Jeff, 32, meet over the internet, and then for coffee. Posters of missing children loom over the couple as they chat, but the most alarming aspects are the pleasantries of their conversation, their casual flirtation. It's a ritual familiar to both  to anyone who's ever dated  but uneasy snippets of dialogue belie their age difference as more than just a number.More children leer from the walls of Jeff's house, this time in seductive poses. He's a photographer, and his squeaky clean accommodations double as a teen modeling studio. Yet, within the very depths of the lion's den, it's the mouse who bears the claws  or, given the film's explicit nature, tranquilizers, scalpels, information, and intent.Hard Candy's visual style resembles that of Jeff's photography: interiors are sleek and minimal, and although an establishing shot places Jeff in the heart of Los Angeles, his neighborhood, like his house, is overwhelmed by emptiness. Drawing from his music video background, director David Slade keeps the camera on the move, constantly scanning bodies and disrupting the placid arrangements with flurries of cuts. The resulting frenzied adrenaline rush confuses and exhilarates, positioning viewer as both predator and prey.Unfortunately, the writing can't keep up with the visual excitement. Intense interrogation sequences soon derail into hackneyed monologues, with the occasional twisted zinger. The story as a whole follows suit, as ridiculous failures of logic and underdeveloped red herrings quickly strain the story's credibility to a breaking point. This midway point, a frustrating cop-out, is but the first of a series of twists and turns that needlessly convolute and frustrate rather than introduce any new ideas. With her muscular build and unflinching resolve, Hayley purports to be a new-age femme avenger, but without any context or convincing character history, she's a one-dimensional character, made up of the least interesting parts of slashers and James Bond villains.Hard Candy bears traces of the sleazy thrillers and rape-revenge sagas of yesteryear. But what made those films successful was the sparseness of their dialogue, which forced them to let raw moods and actions speak for themselves. In contrast, Hard Candy trips and drowns in its own verbiage, too absurd to be serious, too serious to be absurd. But, in the tried and true grindhouse tradition, at least it's got a great poster.",Hard Candy
194,cwarne_uk,Deeply Unsatisfying,3,7 August 2008,"""Hard Candy"" is deeply unsatisfying. Unsure of whether it's a nice little gore-fest or a ""serious"" picture it falls into the hole between the two. The film might have worked played for exploitation value but everyone involved seems to be taking it very seriously. As a serious film though the plot contains several gaping holes that are impossible to paper over (although here fades are used to hide the physically impossible and in the most unlikely scene of all a man mistakes watching a video for his own castration) and the ending is pat and far too tidy (he was a bad man and deserved to die!). Devoid of subtlety or ambiguity basically this is torture porn for those who don't want to see the torture and want a deserving victim. The acting is pretty good for a movie of this kind, Ellen Page is obviously hugely talented but her performance here is too monotone - her character only exists as an on-screen creation, try to imagine her outside the confines of the film and she vanishes. This film falls apart next too Takashi Miike's no less ridiculous but vastly better ""Audition"". (I should in fairness point out that David Slade's follow up ""30 Days Of Night"" is much better - strongly suggesting he is a director who should stick within genre).",Hard Candy

The plot is good, the cinematography is great too but the best thing was the acting game. The dialogue between Jeff and Hayley was so casual, it almost felt real. And I like how you can't stay neutral. The movie makes you think. You see the predator, Jeff, as a normal human being. He talks, he cries, he laughs. And in some moments you almost feel sorry for what's happening to him. But then you remember what he is and you know that he deserved all of what Hayley did to him. But for me her character wasn't enough. I wanted to know more about her. Maybe I needed to know her background story and who she really is. But like I said, the movie doesn't deserve to be missed. It's captivating and I recommend to watch it.",Hard Candy
197,twhiteson,"Disturbing, but gripping!",9,29 April 2006,"""Hard Candy"" is far from a perfect film. It drags on longer than it should. Further, when you really think about the storyline- it contains plot holes that one could drive a truck through! For example, how did Haley (Ellen Page) know that Jeff's (Patrick Wilson) infatuation with old flame, Janelle, could be used so effectively as an emotional bludgeon on him? Or that his neighbors would be gone? (Jeff lives in an isolated location and this girl isn't old enough to drive. So how did she stalk him?) Also one has to suspend disbelief that this slip of a girl (she's barely 5 ft tall and probably weighs less than 100lbs) is able to maneuver a grown man's body onto a table and chairs.Yet, I cannot say when was the last time I saw a movie that has lingered in my mind as this one has. It's truly uncomfortable to watch- although there is no gore, overt sexuality, or graphic violence. Its creepiness is strictly psychological. Firstly, the sight of a 32 yr old man and a 14 yr old flirting with one another is disturbing. It's made even more creepy by the the fact that these characters are not the dirty old man in the proverbial raincoat or the bimbo Lolita in an overdeveloped body. Instead the ""predator"" is handsome, disarmingly charming, and never makes an overt move on the girl, and his ""prey"" is extremely precocious, very cute in a tomboyish, girl-next-door way, and looks every inch the 14 yr old.Patrick Wilson plays Jeff as an extremely confident and subtle predator. From the beginning, we know that Jeff is a sexual predator- no decent 32 yr old man would be flirting suggestively with a 14 yr old online and no decent 32 yr old man would be meeting up with a 14 yr old. There is no doubt that Jeff is a creep- the question is how big of creep is he? The plot bounces back and forth on that issue- with the film at times even allowing the audience to feel a level of sympathy for this man. That we might possibly feel any sympathy for Jeff mainly comes from the performance of Wilson, an acclaimed stage actor giving his best film performance to date. However of the two characters, Jeff is the less flashy role so he tends to be overwhelmed by Haley.Haley is not only the more interesting of the two characters, but is performed with such bravado by Page that her character dominates every scene. It's basically two roles: the wide-eyed innocent who seems completely out of her depth when nervously flirting with this charming older man and then the sadistic little pixie with a caustic wit. The amazing thing about it is that Ms. Page nails both roles without hitch!It's Page's performance that has been stuck in my head. When Jeff wakes up after being drugged, Haley is girlishly giddy with anticipation to start her ""interrogation."" Yet that giddiness instantly turns into disgust and anger when Jeff, upon seeing himself tied up, initially makes a half-joking reference about Haley being into bondage. Also, the ""interrogation"" is a hoot with Haley walking around the room, putting on Jeff's sports coat and designer glasses (mocking his pretensions about wearing such items to impress her), and summing up her sizable evidence that he's a predator: how he researched topics that she's interested in, how she tempted him with various online profiles of females with various ages and that he was only interested in the ones that were young teens, and the facts that he actually met her, let her talk herself into his home, and then allowed her to make alcoholic beverages.) Also, I got a kick out of when she thinks she's figured out the code to Jeff's safe, but, before she tries it, she looks searchingly into his face with a big grin trying to deduce whether she's actually got it right! (That scene reminded me of Christopher Walken's character doing the same thing to Dennis Hopper in ""True Romance."") Overall, it's a mesmerizing performance!",Hard Candy
198,HiddenVoice,Never underestimate Music video /commercial filmmakers.,8,13 April 2006,"This sure is some thriller.Darn those MTV filmmakers,when they really use their heads they show some of their true visual talents.Like the debut made by Mark Romanek in One Hour Photo, David Slade really excels as a director who keeps things extremely intense and gripping with a touch of shocking elements and pure disturbance due to its story.A film about a pedophile who invites a 14 year old girl into his house only to lead a disturbing game of cat and mouse with shocking consequences and shocking twists.Along with the superb debut and impressive writing ,it is actually the young Ellen Page who carries the film.You won't find her not mentioned in any review to this film.Hers is a performance worth mentioning,because she takes a huge shift towards her character.

The subject matter itself is the main point which carries the film, and it really could have been a much better film if the length had been shortened, and the direction made much tighter. Plot descriptions have been explained in so much detail that there's nothing really to add, but on viewing the film it does become undeniably tedious and, in parts, frankly irritating. The denouement is weak and unsatisfactory, and the whole effort somewhat disappointing. It is undoubtedly a film with a reputation higher than its actual substance.",Hard Candy
200,cmmescalona,Am I crazy?,5,21 September 2006,"Cinematography apart and the masterful talent of colour timing this film, I simply can't believe it's been praised as it's been throughout the 16 pages of comments in here! Hard Candy is what it is: a horror-suspense-thriller with two superb talents. And that's where it ends. Contents? What about it? OK!, there's a lot of work in this script. A lot of work! I can't deny that writing a movie like this is not easy, because you have to find great characters and have them masterfully played. And they did the latter.But, in the end, it's a very American movie for American audiences. This film goes sooooooo over the top in everything that it is absolutely necessary to suspend disbelief to watch it. And that is something to do with Harry Potter or Donald Duck: you know these kind of films are in the realm of fantasy: they'll never, ever, try to convince you they're for real. But when you try to criticise a social, political, rational issue, you shouldn't try -ever, doing something like Hard Candy. I'm a fan of new cinema, of realism, of Italian or French Cinema Veritè, but I think it's really difficult to swallow the incredible amount of rubbish, remakes, repetitions and sub-standard films Hollywood's been making in recent times.Realism and fantasy stick to your mind and linger there for quite a long time, maybe forever; gross exaggeration simply fades after the credits are over.",Hard Candy
201,LadyLiberty,Hard Candy is one sweet piece of cinema!,10,7 January 2007,"I'd heard a little about Hard Candy (all of it good) when it was originally released, but then...nothing. But a friend of mine who's a real movie fan remembered, too, so when she saw it at a local video rental store, she grabbed a copy. We had the chance to sit down and take a look at Hard Candy this weekend, and what a sweet movie it proved to be! Hard Candy is (as I learned from a little online research) Internet slang for an underaged girl. We've all heard the stories about those men who prey on those underaged girls via online chatrooms and instant messages, too. Hayley Stark (Ellen Page) is one of them. At 14, she's got a provocative screen name and flirtatious manner that's just begging for unsavory contact. 32 year-old photographer Jeff Kohlver (Patrick Wilson) is happy to oblige.After several weeks of online chat, Hayley tells Jeff she'd like to meet him. Jeff eagerly agrees, and the two set up a time and place that very day. The two get together in a local coffee shop, but it isn't long before Hayley finds herself agreeing to visit Jeff's house where he's got an MP3 file of a concert that she really, really wants to hear. In short order, the teenager is drinking vodka screwdrivers and wandering around Jeff's house looking at framed photos of young models and chirpily asking questions. But just as Jeff moves in for the obvious next step, he finds the tables turned and Hayley well in charge of everything that happens next.That's it. That's the entire storyline. In fact, that's almost the entire cast. Almost all of Hard Candy takes place in Jeff's house with only Jeff and Hayley present. And yet Hard Candy is one of the most gripping and suspenseful films I've ever seen. That's due to several crucial elements.Ellen Page gives a singularly brilliant performance (she's older than 14 in real life, but still quite young and I suspect we can expect formidable performances from her for a long time to come). Despite  or perhaps because of  her sweet pixie good looks, you find yourself fearing for her and then just fearing her by turns. Patrick Wilson is a good looking man who manages to convey the visceral creepiness of a pedophile perfectly, but also somehow comes across as an otherwise perfectly regular guy. Without his finely nuanced performance, there's no way we could go from hating this guy and everything he does to actually having some sympathy for the poor bastard.Brief appearances by the wonderful Sandra Oh (as Jeff's neighbor) and Jennifer Holmes (who plays Jeff's grown-up girlfriend) are truly brief. Hard Candy rests entirely on the performances of its two leads. As good as both are, the movie would have been much less if not for some fantastic direction from David Slade and Brian Wilson's unparalleled script. The script is truly amazing, and Slade took it and brought it to life with all its stupendous possibilities realized.The sets are few but perfectly rendered; the edits (again, the director gets some credit here, but so does the obviously world class editor) are terrific; and the cinematography and some delightfully skewed camera angles all mesh together with that superlative script and those stellar performances to offer up a movie watching experience that's everything an avid fan might expect and then some.Hard Candy includes some very controversial subject matter and some extremely uncomfortable scenes. Yet nothing is superfluous, and it all contributes to the overall effect. That effect, I have to say, is considerable. The movie ended with my friend, me, and her daughter sitting in her living room with our mouths open. I'm not entirely sure what the first comment was or who voiced it as the credits started to roll  it's hard to remember anything when you're stunned!  but I'm pretty sure it was, ""Wow."" Yes. That sums Hard Candy up nicely.Hard Candy didn't enjoy broad publicity or release likely in some part due to the subject matter. But it also suffered from a very low budget (about $1 million) which means there was little to spare for publicity. Despite severe budgetary constraints, you'll find the movie itself lacks nothing where quality is concerned. In fact, I think the only thing Hard Candy lacks is the larger audiences it should have had and the avid fans it so deserves. Consider this review some small effort to rectify that egregious oversight.If you're a fan of cinema, and you appreciate brilliant performances, direction, or scripts, rent a copy of Hard Candy and do it sooner rather than later. I realize it's early in the year, but Hard Candy is so good I'm already wondering if it might be the best film I see in 2007. I'm certainly betting it's one of them.FAMILY SUITABILITY: Hard Candy is rated R for ""disturbing violent and aberrant sexual content involving a teen, and for language."" Hard Candy may be about a teenager, but it is in no way suitable for children or even young teens. Hard Candy is, indeed, quite disturbing and in a singularly adult way. I'd recommend the movie only for those age 16 or so and up, and mature older teens at that. But that being said, I'd recommend Hard Candy to those with the stomach for it, and I'd recommend it in the strongest possible terms.",Hard Candy
202,danthewrestlingmanorigin,"The most Bold, And Daring Thriller In Years'",10,26 December 2006,"WOW indeed. This ranks as the most bold, and daring thriller in many many years'. Patrick Wilson, and Ellen Page should both become huge stars, as there performances were absolutely brilliant. The viewer finds himself in an uncomfortable position, as you actually feel bad for a pedophile. Don't get me wrong the man is worthless scum, however what he is put through is so brutal, it's just natural for a decent person to feel sympathy for him. Again Wilson should be congratulated for pulling off his portrayal so well. He's not the only one with a breakthrough performance however, as Ellen Page handled her role with such mature intensity. Some have argued however that a girl of her characters' age, would not be able to hatch such a gruesome revenge plot, and generally they would probably be right, but Ms. Page certainly made me buy her character, as a focused, calculating angel of death. Page herself was older than the character she was playing, and that was a wise choice, as the themes in this story would be to intense to expose a youngster to. All in all I was biting my nails the whole time, and that is the mark of a great thriller. Why this didn't have a wide release I do not know, there is so much boring garbage, being puked out by Hollywood these days, particularly in the thriller genre, and this could have been a sleeper hit. Alas we'll have to keep buying great films' like this on DVD, and deal with drivel like the When A Stranger Calls remake in theaters'.",Hard Candy
203,Paddy-49,"Disturbing and dark, with a brilliant performance by Ellen Page",7,19 February 2007,"This is, to say the least, an extremely disturbing film and without the astonishing performance by Ellen Page I would have a problem in recommending it. But Ms Page is so remarkable in a harrowing role that the film is a must see  although men especially will watch some of the scenes peeking from behind their hands in front of their faces! In common with other thrillers (and it is a thriller) such as Fatal Attraction or much of the Hitchcock genre there is a major surprise a little way into the movie. To give away the surprise would give away the film so I won't do it. Suffice to say that although we may think that we may know what this film is going to be about from the opening scenes in fact that is misleading.The likely development of the film from the beginning is that it will be a film about a vulnerable young girl being preyed upon by a much older man who is probably (although not certainly) a paedophile. The girl, Hayley, seems vulnerable, a bit silly, overtly provocative and fully aware of the fact that she is attractive to men  especially those like Jeff who like young girls. So the story will be about the danger that she is in and the question will be whether or not Jeff is really a predator who will seek to have some sort of physical relationship with Hayley, or maybe he is ""just"" a bit of a ""perv""  possibly a voyeuristic photographer who likes to take photographs of young girls rather than molest them. But in fact that is not the core of the film at all and the events that unfold are far for sinister and scary than even that fairly frightening scenario! Most straight men will have a struggle with this film  and I don't mean the struggle that will be all too close for comfort as the story unfolds. What I mean is that the Hayley character, so well played by the entrancing Ellen Page, is sexually attractive and that very fact may be disturbing. But as the Bill Nighy character in the recent ""Notes on a Scandal"" suggests many mature adults find some pubescent teenage boys/girls attractive  but they don't commence affairs with them (as his 37 year old wife has just done with a fifteen year old boy)! But, as I have said, this is not a story about whether Jeff is a predatory paedophile or whether Hayley is at risk as a result. It's far darker than that!",Hard Candy
204,dantonstl,waste of time,3,19 January 2019,"I didn't like this movie. it was a thriller...and there were some brutal circumstances going on, between Patrick Wilson and ellen page, but I felt that the near death experiences were too problematic and unbelievable that the ending didn't make sense. I mean the film tries to cram the ending into the last five minutes of the film, but honestly for the whole movie to be about how awesome it was to escape near death...it was less than exhilarating.patrick Wilson and ellen page made the film intense for more than half the movie but again, to me it just collapsed and was a big let down.",Hard Candy
205,FilmCreature,FilmCreature Reviews 'Hard Candy',9,21 November 2007,"It is rare, truly rare, when a film is actually frightening. 'Hard Candy' is one of these films. It gets inside of you. Digs away at your mind. It's altogether creepy.And at the core of this film is two actors: a then-eighteen-year-old Ellen Page, and Tony Award-nominated Patrick Wilson.A prior warning: Page's performance is just a wee bit alarming. She plays Haley, a fourteen-year-old girl who meets ""Lensmaster319"" on an online chat room, who actually turns out to be a charming, 32-year-old photographer named Jeff. They decide to meet. At the Nighthawks coffee shop, they flirt, and Hayley convinces Jeff to take her home. They seem to be perfect together. Their conversation flows like running water--until Hayley prepares some drinks.Before he can do anything, Jeff passes out, and wakes up tied to a chair. A predicament indeed. Hayley tells him she suspects that he is a pedophile.Hayley, the sweet, charismatic teenager who once seemed so foolish and naïve, is now holding all the cards. And this is just the beginning. Ellen Page's performance is one of complete, gritty realism and honesty. She knows how to act like a sweet teenaged girl named Hayley, and when to turn into the monster with the same name. The cinematography is fantastic; 'Hard Candy' looks simply gorgeous. And the film's #1 advantage over other thrillers is the fact that it is so scary. I can't stop myself from thinking about this movie, even after three weeks! I'd be worried about seeing this. It is NOT a film for everyone. If you decide to see it, be warned, certain fears from this film may linger for quite some time.9/10",Hard Candy
206,idonotexist,Home alone with some maturity,6,2 September 2006,"Always interesting when something like this comes along. I read some of the reviews and most people had an odd impression on it but generally liked it. Naturally i figured this has to be good in a strange way and stray from the pack, which made it a must watch. Well behold, another mindless flick which uses a generic plot with little substance.The movie starts off great, a little confusing even because of the mixed messages being sent about what each character's agenda is and this really created the sense of mystique. Unfortunately there is a definitive point (i won't spoil it) after which it just degenerates into one of dozen ""woman vs man in a house"" movies we have all seen before and you just know what will happen for the remaining 1 hour. I shouldn't fault the screenplay for dropping the plot bomb this early on as sometimes good movies develop around a known plot. However there is one major shortcoming to this approach and hard candy suffers from it; nothing about this plot is really played out any different from other similar movies and it simple becomes a failed thriller replaced with mindless PG13 violence. In fact the movie is painful to watch because both of the leads are terminally insane, just in different ways. This isn't good vs bad type of a movie where you have usual frictions. This is psycho vs sicko and it plays out very much like it - dysfunctional. nothing about the cohesion makes real sense, the script leaves holes the size of a truck that are not made up for... you will see once you look past what it says it is about (the movie). it's not about that at all.I am still exactly wondering how does the underage story even fit in here.. or right, it doesn't. To keep it short, replace ""kids"" with serial killer, adulterer, angry wife etc and there would be no difference. As such, this is simply another man vs wife in a house type flick, with a mental premise where the antagonism drives the characters up a wall. The sense of control is false and left blank by the script beyond the obvious lines. I would go as far as say that hard candy relies on the public's opinion on the subject it does not even look at to create its interest.It started great, and i was expecting something along the lines of lost in translation and Lilja 4-ever but no, we get us a regular SAW type massacre production. Intellectuals can just skip this one, for it will offer you no satisfaction, just the premise of psycho carnage so there isn't even any gore in it beyond suggestive content (a big let down since the set up was there.. lots of smoke and no ignition for short).But the acting is great, so good that it makes it surreal to stare at the screen. That alone makes it a good watch, just don't expect anything provoking or lasting.this is a solid 6/10 and not an iota more.",Hard Candy
207,VeganVag,I enjoyed this more in 2006 when I used to drink.,6,31 January 2021,"But this time, sober & retired, it just didn't make sense, her having the strength of a grown man handling dead weight TWICE?! lol! All I could think throughout this was ""put a sock in his damn mouth!"" but he should have been on the floor tied up most of the time with handcups she already had in her backpack, and still doomed up.And why not cut off his peen, dang it?!This would have been a slam dunk if those simple acts had occurred, along with ""who the fck are you?"" would have helped to know that too.

208,NoName1989,"Very good cinematography and direction in general and very good acting, but the story doesn't seem right.",6,27 July 2007,"In the beginning, this film was very interesting but as soon as Hayley had tied Jeff up, the film deteriorated. Hayley wants to take revenge for all the bad things Jeff had done before. The problem with this film is, that you have lost your sympathy for Hayley halfway the film. After that she is just as bad as Jeff. Jeff did awful things, absolutely! but that doesn't mean that Hayley has the right to do horrible things to him! I know it's just a film, but I hate it if in films, the ""victims"" become just as bad as the criminal. The acting is very good, and also the cinematography is very good! David Slade has quite a bit of potential, but in the future he should make a film with a better story. All together, this is a disappointment. The acting and cinematography and music are very good, but cannot save the film.",Hard Candy
209,iReviewFilms,Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: Hard Candy,8,10 January 2011,"I was not sure what to expect from this film at first but what it delivered was a intense psychological thriller that never really let up until the credits rolled at the end. As part of a very small cast, both Wilson (A-Team, Watchmen) and especially Page (Juno, Inception) gave exceptional performances really adding to the depth of the movie.A clever plot idea based on a 'the hunter has now become the hunted' theme that gets progressively darker as the movie goes on pays dividends and enables the movie to look at a relationship that hasn't really been explored before in this context. I found Page's character very interesting as you are never quite sure whether you are on her side or not and where her motivation comes from, a hard one to read.The ability to maintain the suspense is also impressive with a distinct lack of gore throughout the movie which worked well in this case, especially in one specific scene (you will be able to work out which one).I would definitely recommenced this film to all, unless you are expecting a horror/gorefest in which case this may not be what you are after.For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com",Hard Candy
210,fawn_jane,Good Acting; Poor Writing,5,4 September 2013,"Patrick Wilson is pretty unconvincing as a pedophile. He's handsome, and has a glamorous career and a cool apartment. There must be pedophiles out there like that, but not really the typical image the comes to mind.Ellen Page is also unconvincing in a way. As usual, she plays the role of the annoying precocious child, but of the horribly overgrown 18-year-old sort. Her role is convincing when she is pretending to be the ingenue, but when she turns on Wilson's character, she blatantly turns into a preachy mouthpiece for the director/writer in a way that seems out of place.The movie can best be described as torture-porn. It reminds me of the show ""Dexter"" in its attempts to justify the horror of the protagonists crimes with ""they deserve it..."", although in the case of this movie I don't buy it - except kinda-sorta near the end of the movie, maybe.Sleeping with underage girls is horrible and all, but come on, trying to hook up with an underage girl through the internet is not in the same league as say, raping a toddler; it's terrible but doesn't quite justify the violent retribution against Wilson's character that the writer/director seems to want the audience to root for.There was this one weird part, when Wilson's character supposedly hurts Page's character by rolling a desk chair into her, that he happens to be tied to. That just seemed rather silly to me. When you are tied to a chair, you can't hurt someone by ramming them repeatedly, you just don't have the leverage to propel yourself all that hard.Despite all of this, Wilson and Page do very excellent jobs acting, and these are quite demanding roles. But they are just in the wrong, poorly-written movie. There's barely any more plot or other characters. At the end the movie left me feeling rather empty. It's like... that's it?",Hard Candy
211,RobinCook70,Topnotch,10,29 September 2006,"I rented the DVD today after a long wait for it to reappear on the shelves for rental since it's been checked out nonstop since DVD release. I would like to add first off that the DVD special features are way above the average .. excellent, so I recommend viewing them after watching the movie ... even the audio commentaries! All are very well done.I had watched Mysterious Skin and the Woodsman movies, so after them this movie's subject content was not offensive. All areas of this movie were totally topnotch .. the casting, writing, script, acting, audio, colors, camera .. everything. I found it interesting that the story had been drawn from some gals in Japan luring pedophiles online to meet them to cause them grief. Also, for them to have filmed this movie in 18 days with such an unstintingly good finished product is further incredible.If you are tired of movies about pedophiles with hackneyed story lines and scripts that are clichéd, you'll be very surprised with this very unique thriller, and won't be disappointed. It's not family fare, so keep the kiddies away. There are no sex scenes or physical molestation or bloody gore ... nothing typical.So, if you want to see an excellent intense thriller, I recommend this movie.",Hard Candy

Always a bad idea. However, this visit is very strange indeed.Golly, this is a great movie. It's independent, but has a neat appearance of Sandra Oh, who stars in Grey's Anatomy and Sideways.Directed by music video director David Slade, the directing was good enough, but it seemed like the camera was stuck on zoom for a few scenes.Written by Brian Nelson, it's one of the most original and interesting scripts in ages, well written in all departments.The acting was great from Patrick Wilson and Sandra Oh, and while I wasn't completely happy with Ellen Page's acting, she did a good enough job.This is great for a night home, or even day, as the entire movie takes place in the daylight (rare for a horror movie, if you count this as one) So I hope you enjoy this indie treat.",Hard Candy
213,greenylennon,Who's afraid of the little girl?,9,20 August 2008,"Hard Candy is sharp like a diamond perfectly cut, and like a diamond, it shines. It's so unpredictable and so cruel, the seemingly innocent teenager can show psychotic sides you'd never want to discover, and the devilish pedophile is not so terrible. Who's right, who's wrong? You never know. Like in everyday life, nobody is totally black or totally white, but has a wide shade of feelings and many hidden sides. This could have been a disaster if they hadn't found the right actors. Ellen Page opens her sweet eyes up but she is not an angel: besides, she remains in your mind, you can feel that her words and her looks hurt more than a knife. Her performance deserves an Oscar. Patrick Wilson fills the spaces Page leaves empty and he's so professional and nice that you find yourself feeling sorry for Jeff, anything he could have done. Scenes are well composed and the cinematography is very good, its colours hit your eyes but it's better to say the whole film hits you.",Hard Candy
214,skirmantux,The Movie You never Seen!,9,16 September 2006,"At Sunday I wanted to watch a light thriller movie and I thought, that ""Hard Candy"" would be the best choice that day, but I was wrong...The beginning was quite interesting. Confersations was light and restful, but at the half of movie - I was shocked!!! Jeff and Hayley changed they real world roles and the torturer was the 14 year old girl. She was already planed everything and her plan became true. She bond Jeff in chair and accused him, that he is a pedophile. That was OK, but when she cohesive him on table - then was a biggest male nightmare of all time. The first time ever I don't wanted to watch all movie..All actors acted perfect. They won't make mistakes. All psychological scenes was very real so that's why I don't wanted to watch the all movie. I can't believe that this movie was filmed in 18 days. It look like it was filmed about 3 months. Idea of the movie was one of the most original in years, but I wont watch him again. I give 9 to my memory...",Hard Candy
215,RichardvonLust,Pure Perversion,1,12 February 2011,"This is the sort of film that should never be made. It attempts to justify a 14 year old girl abusing, torturing, mutilating and eventually forcing the death of a 32 year old man she suspects to be a 'paedophile'. Whether he is guilty or not, whether he looks at kiddie porn or not or even makes porn himself can never be taken as justification for the utterly sick and perverse attacks made upon him by the 'child'. The scene where she prepares him for castration and takes delight in savoring the power she has over him is nothing short of perverse and disgusting pornography. This film merely reinforces stereotypical attitudes of blind hatred and lynch mob mentality. All criminals should be given fair trial and judicial punishment. Never should the public be encouraged to take matters in their own hands. I strongly recommend you avoid this film completely.",Hard Candy
216,Richard_vmt,Clever but ultimately boring.,7,27 April 2012,"The entire story hangs on the unusual appearance of Ellen Page as Haley. Not only does she look like a physically immature 14-year-old, but in the beginning footage there is not even any trace of gender about her. Los Angeles photographers may be Los Angeles photographers but even so, it is difficult not to resent his interest in her.However, all that changes--in the bat of an eye--when she reveals her true personality, which is largely a fully developed man-hating Feminist. Where once I was critical of him now I felt supportive. The girl is a monster and the film now assumes the familiar form of a horror film, the horror of a psychopathic 14-year-old girl. It is this ability to work the audience both ways that I call clever. In other terms, such as character development it is simply ridiculous. In fact the entire shibboleth of child sexual abuse founders on the fact (unrecognizable to parents) that a teenage girl is not a child. In the initial footage she is a child but she grows up fast and now what she chiefly needs is a good F-ing to bring her into line with humanity. But this man is unable to pull it off and instead loses his nuts. I was rooting for an ending where he becomes her willing houseboy. Instead, sans nuts, he still is able to summon up a man's strength. This is not a bad movie, but I found it boring in the end. I watched it twice but skipped the ending the second time. As this world goes, this is a pretty good flick.",Hard Candy
217,sheepmonk2000,Zzz,2,13 December 2007,"Yes OK this movie is good in that it does provoke a response from its viewer. The fact I found myself sympathising with the proposed 'bad guy' is testament to this fact. So, so far this sounds like a pretty positive review of a potentially credible movie - wrong! As an all round viewing experience the film is total garbage. Sure the script is provocative, but also completely unrealistic! True enough Ellen Page's character is a bona-fide bitch, but that doesn't make her performance convincing nor does it validate the painfully patronising efforts of the Director. Basically, the main factor that determines the rating I award a movie is based upon whether or not I enjoyed it, and to put it simply, no I didn't enjoy this movie. The lead actress is way over the top, the lighting, dialogue and location are completely unrealistic, and the actual point of the film confusing. So to conclude, yeah sure it makes you think but what's the point exactly and why? Should I feel sorry for the young girl driven to such extreme measures...erm no 'cus she's presented as a two dimensional character and so not only is she predictable but quite simply, very dull to watch. Do I feel sympathy for the suspected paedophile now that a psychotic teenager is torturing him? Erm, well obviously yeah, I have male genitalia so can obviously empathise with his situation, but otherwise what's your point...? Will I watch this film again? No! Why, is it because it is so disturbing and provocative that it damages your fragile mind? No! It's because it's a complete excercise in futility.",Hard Candy
218,OllieZ,Nothing special...,7,21 June 2006,"Hard Candy is actually a watchable film. The actors were certainly game (all two of them, the others merely bit parts) and the cinematography was good but flawed.It was not handled as well as I thought it could have been. Thought provoking? I do not think so. Although the ambiguity over who was the ""bad guy"" was there, the film seemed to run out of ideas.Yes, it is interesting to see a torture scene; it is what he deserves apparently. But for 15 minutes? The camera work was good in the way that it made you feel nauseous, so it wasn't an easy film to experience. It left most up to the imagination.Also the sense of space in the film was closed down due to the amount of close up's. Yes, this might be a device intended by the director so that we as an audience feel claustrophobic, but in the end, it really annoyed me in places.The again, what did I expect? The premise of this film is hardly brain teasing stuff. Again, people will end up going ""but the film leaves it open"" argument. Ambiguous Schmiguous. The film started so well, but failed to capitalise on it.The film was just exploitative; there are some good shocks and the tension is neatly crafted, it is shame the pacing is not so great.But it felt un-finished and ultimately a tad pointless. The mind games that Hayley plays on the photographer were gripping initially, but by the half way mark, I understood what was going on, and knew that he would kill himself.She forced him to kill himself - in a similar way to Saw. Not a big surprise.Still, it was a decent little film that succeeds in making the viewer uncomfortable. But it could have been better and more efficient. In a world of Saw's and Hostel's, maybe this is too much, too soon.",Hard Candy
219,cablooie,14 yo Jason Bourne+James Bond+Batman+Joker+Clockwork Orange+hate pit,1,21 April 2018,"A 14yo girl with the skills of Jason Bourne, the tactics of James Bond and the physical strength of Ben Grimm lures a guy into a trap and tortures him under the suspicion he ""might"" have done something wrong. But according to the story it is kind of fair and right, for some reason. She beats him up quite a few times, actually she kicks his ass around hands down, outsmarts him, outtalks him, outeverythings him.
If this was a story about a 14yo boy torturing a woman to have her confess crimes he can't prove, the feminist party would have burned theaters.
Apparently, the other way round is perfectly legit, a man is guilty until proven innocent and torturing a suspect is perfectly fine. Good concept, Guantanamo.
And a 14yo brat can talk him into killing himself. Yep, she can talk. That's all she does for 95% of this silly film actually. Past 30 minutes in the movie you start hoping he'd kill the damn chatterbox, regardless he's guilty or not. It could have been e decent horror short with an adolescent psycho, but no. Somebody wanted a revenge movie justifying torturing suspects. That claim killed it together with the 14yo Xmen-like brat.

Amazing is not even the word, to describe this film as amazing is an understatement.You know why this film is good? Because we see a side of the story that we never see. We see someone who is usually portrayed as 'weak' and 'vulnerable' take control. If this was any other setting I'd feel sorry for the victim... In this film I don't. That's what makes this film good. We see a side we never see and it's portrayed in this amazing way. This is a film that will stay with you long after you've watched it.It doesn't take ages to get into. Everything about this film is just perfect. Yeah, there isn't that much character development like other films... So what? Why does everything have to be so generic?

The film spares no time and cuts right to the chase. The action is quite visceral and leaves little to the imagination, but not going over the top. I think the little red riding hood cover is just awesome, though think more along the lines of American McGee's Little Red Riding Hood (if he had one)... priceless! While the film can seem a bit grueling, it is well worth the effort, and hopefully puts a message out there to all Internet predators that eventually they will become the prey. Keep that in your mind when you watch this film, the guy is not a victim in the script but simply has the role reversed and becomes the prey. Hopefully this film makes a difference and curbs the appetite of the lowlife scum that is the Internet predator.Great film!",Hard Candy
222,VenturousArtist,"""Harder to Chew.""",5,18 December 2017,"Hard Candy is a challenging film to experience viewing. It's discomforting, questionable, and shares a weird parallel with reality as it discusses a heavy controversial topic. It immediately immerses audiences into its unsettling universe where everyone are either perpetrators or oblivious to the main narrative. Despite focusing primarily on two characters, what mysterious events unfold among them are deeply alienating and horrific.However, even with its powerful narrative and performances, it's a complicated and vague film that expects audiences to develop their interpretations of certain outcomes than presenting them. Other issues include its sometimes disjointed cinematography, disposable minor characters, characters having an identity crisis, some misleading and miswritten scenes, and obvious missed opportunities to make a statement in exchange of simpler storytelling.It's a seemingly hard film to watch that's actually harder to chew.",Hard Candy
223,crystallogic,I'm a decent guy! Ask anyone!,6,30 July 2018,"Well now, the profusion of low scores for this title I'm seeing on IMDB are interesting. Some of the reviews themselves are rather revealing, too. I don't blame most of my fellows; I couldn't really give this a higher score even though a part of me wanted to, but on the whole I'm very glad I watched this film and as a work of art that puts the viewer in the position of being the ""victim"" of a kind of sociological experiment, I think it's an admirable success.A mistake I think many people make when viewing film is to try to ascribe a message to it: a moral you can sum up in a sentence, a payload or political polemic. It's not that people necessarily want to see this in the films they watch, but they can't help but do this sometimes, and oftentime the result of their conclusions leaves viewers feeling angry and manipulated.Make no mistake, then, this film is manipulative. I ask, though, why shouldn't it be? Furthermore, although it's manipulative in a rather extreme, even heavy-handed way, I don't think it's trying to deliver a message to the viewer in a neat little box with a bow. What I believe it is doing is presenting a situation which, after all, is not all that uncommon in the annals of recent human history, and turning it on its head; asking us to examine it from several different angles and perspectives which we might not have considered. So, the one criticism I really have of this film is unfortunately the same one that everybody else who actually liked it (that is, those that aren't utterly convinced that it's trying to shove a feminist message down their throats) have: I don't see how haley was able to do some of the things she apparently did in this movie. The precociousness and intelligence, I can buy, but the physical strength is a bit more of a stretch. Interestingly, every time jeff gets poleaxed and comes to, haley has done something else rather incredible with his body. How does she manage it? jeff must be twice her weight and size. Even if she bench presses that kind of weight regularly, managing to manoeuvre him into a chair, get off his clothes, suffocate him unconscious with cling wrap (in reality I suspect he would have been fighting really hard and it would have taken several minutes to accomplish this, though I suppose he could have been already weakened by being drugged earlier), suspend him from the ceiling -- all that stuff stretches credibility to its breaking point. In spite of having no difficulty accepting her intelligence, too, I did find at a couple of points that I was listening to an older woman speak, and not a fourteen-year-old-girl. This is particularly evident when she is reprimanding jeff for allowing her to drink and accepting her flirtations. I""ts so easy to blame a kid!"", she says. ""If a kid says, 'hey, let's make screwdrivers!', you take the alcohol away!"" I couldn't help but feel this was the screen-writer pointing the finger and not a ""kid"" talking at all, though Ellen page delivered the whole scene with a lot of feeling and intensity.As for her incredible physical feats, hey, maybe she had an accomplice we didn't even see? We always get those scenes from Jeff's perspective, right, so, you never know! I'm only being half-serious, but the last-moment revelation at the end that jeff in fact had an accomplice and they were responsible for the missing/dead girl together could make for a nice comparison.The lack of other characters in the movie didn't really bother me, though, despite that last-moment reveal of a person of great significance whom we never even heard of up til that point. This after all isn't the point of the film, and in the end I admire it's sheer dedication to minimalism. This could have been a stage play, easily. And some of my favourite productions are two-handers in minimal sets, so this one fits right in. At 100 minutes though, it is perhaps just a little too lenghty, or maybe I would have spent some of that extra time in greater build-up before the two characters met, or background, or maybe even a phone call or two between jeff and Aaron to establish that they had some kind of relationship so it didn't come so much out of left-field. Still, I think it entirely possible that things like that would have taken away from the direct, what-you-see-is-what-you-get nature of the film, and that is in the end one of its most admirable qualities.The other thing to really admire in the film are the performances, which are both top-class in their own right. haley is adorable and, during those moments when we still feel jeff might be innocent, it's easy to see how he could be taken in fully and fighting with himself to stay away from this dangerously precocious and sexually awakened youngster. Jeff himself is put through the wringer of emotions and displays a wide range, but mostly he just comes across as a rather normal, low-key guy in his early thirties, the type whom you wouldn't think twice about meeting on the street. That's part of the genius of it. He has an explanation for everything; he has no harmful urges, he's just a photographer!In the end, I don't think this movie comes down firmly on haley's side any more than it really does on Jeff's. I could wish that we knew a little more about her, because I don't think the role of badass vigilante entirely suits, but I'm ok with a bit of obscurity and appreciate that the filmmakers didn't want to get bogged down in backstory and unnecessary complexities. This is a ""what if?"" movie, and thus I think it's advisable to suspend disblief at some of its more incredible elements and allow the thought experiment to proceed. The thought experiment in question asks you to imagine ""what if this often all-too-real and tragic situation happened this way instead?"" ""What if the child got the upper hand? What if the child in question had her own particular kind of psychopathy to contend with?"" It's interesting, and timely, and although I have some reservations, I'm glad it was made.",Hard Candy
224,Arlis,Ellen Page made the movie amazing.,7,30 October 2006,"I kept hearing praise over this movie from a friend and I had to watch it. I knew basically it was about a man who had a thing for young girls and the events that unfolded during his pursue of a 14 year old.The following comments are very descriptive of the movie so they DO contain spoilers and you should be warned.A young girl meets a guy on the internet who is in his 30's and they decide to meet. They meet at a coffee shop and through weird circumstances end up at his house. You find yourself fearing for the girl but find she is not the sweet innocent person she seems to be.Ellen Page did an amazing job of being this little innocent, very kid like 14 year old with the adorable actions of a minor, the spunk of a pre-teen and the intellect of a young adult and you as a viewer could so easily imagine her being taken advantage of by this man.When she arrives at his house the stage is set and she is setting it for him, we as a viewer keep thinking hes being extremely nice but wouldn't any ""good"" stalker/child molester probably be. Doesn't evil usually wear a smile?The girl seems to be falling in a trap with every innocent word she breaths and I couldn't help but think that she is seducing him and that hes innocent, BUT THEN - POW - the tables are turned and you are smacked in the face and the truth hurts.. You think to yourself that perhaps you are scum too for feeling sorry for him for a while as she becomes this very intelligent, very adult like person who basically spells it out for him...Grown men don't meet little girls from the internet. Grown Men don't invite little girls to their house. Grown Men do not offer 14-year olds liquor!!! Grown Men don't allow children to pose nude for them in their house alone!!!!I found myself shamefully listening as I thought, Oh my god, I felt sorry for him for a second. I thought he was being tempted and it wouldn't be his fault. I felt like scum because she was right a grown man doesn't do any of those things - that is enough to make him scum, how could I have not hated him from the first.Ellen Page, although playing a 14-year old, got in my face and hit me with the truth, hit this man with the truth, showed a reality that is as real as real can get, a reality that is much scarier than any Jason Vorhees, Michael Myers or Freddy Kruger movie. This is an average Joe who molests kids, your kids , my kids - this is horror...This is real.The events that unfolded after that were light in comparison to what many of these guys need done to them, but it was still morbid and horrifying to see. I was not bothered so much by the torture, but I think anyone who has had thoughts like that about a kid might feel a tad uncomfortable seeing what she does to him.The movie was pretty good as a whole, but I found it far from perfect. I absolutely loved Ellen Page and even thought Patrick Wilson was great. The direction and production values did very little for me, but in a drama such as this I rarely pay attention to that stuff.I would like to know what made this kid do the things she did. Did she know the girl that was killed and think the man had something to do with it? Did she have a friend he had molested? My favorite theory is that perhaps someone else had done a similar thing to her and now shes seeking revenge. In that situation maybe she feels she can take her suffering out on just any child molester and get satisfaction. Perhaps she has done this before...perhaps she will again... Something for child molesters to fear. The Charles Bronson of the new millennium. Vigilante killers seeking justice. I wouldn't mind seeing such a thing happen to these guys who do this.I am not one who doesn't believe that people do screwed up things because of the screwed up things that have happened to them. I know society, family, music, television whatever may make us crazy or mean or whatever, but it doesn't change the fact that if we harm other people that we deserve to be punished. Rehabilitated is the route I would prefer, but hey this made a decent movie and I don't see it causing any young girls to become stalkers - I don't see the hunter becoming the hunted in the near future, but perhaps some dirty child molester out there might see this and change his mind or get a tad scared, at least he will recognize and have someone telling him - Hard candy is hard to swallow and biting it might just break your teeth....",Hard Candy
225,blindredemption,As a Film Maker...,7,2 April 2008,"I am truly impressed by this film in a number of ways.First off the cast is great everyone of them. Ellen & Patrick literally carry this film front to back, with both of them almost being the only two characters. Ellen is spookily convincing as a 14 year old, who brings pedophiles to justice. Patrick is also equally good as the pedophile who comes face to face with his problem, and takes forced attrition. Also, every now and then a secondary character is brought into the mix, but they don't move the picture so much as they add to it. What moves the picture is the characters we don't see, that being Donna, and Aaron (I think you'll understand what I mean). The fact we never once see the two characters who have in fact set this story into motion, is great.Direction/Cinematography wise, this movie is also great. The camera is almost always moving, but not shaky or frantic, it has a sureness to it that makes you feel the director was MORE than confident in his actors to carry the piece than pretty camera angles. Also I'm guess they added that blueness to the film in Post-Production. Nice touch.This Two Lead character driven picture was both a surprise and joy to watch. I'd say watch it, if you aren't too squeamish or touchy about the subject matter.",Hard Candy
226,doctorgonzo23,Great Film,8,17 December 2009,"Hard Candy was not the easiest film to watch, but for all the right reasons. If you've read the other comments, you know that the subject matter deals with the ever so squirm-worthy pedophilia and Internet luring... but Hard Candy turns the whole idea on its head.Ellen Page is cast as the precocious (surprise, surprise) female lead and plays her character beautifully; oscillating between an insecure teen and a vengeful, manipulative, take charge persona. The dialog is well written and never seems to drag.Patrick Wilson turns in a believable performance with depth and character. Neither character is what they seem at first and both actors do a fantastic job of morphing from one set of character traits to another.If you haven't seen this film, I highly recommend it. It has the feeling of a stage drama at times, as there is really only one set and two characters (aside from Sandra Oh's cameo), but it adds to the almost claustrophobic atmosphere. The plot manages to keep you guessing until the very end and there are enough well crafted loose ends to provoke some interesting conjectures after watching.",Hard Candy

229,nickzbekool,will redefine thrillers,8,23 November 2006,"this is the most shocking, most disturbing, and most unbelievable movie I've ever seen. It was so unpredictable that when you get the whole point of it you are glued to the seat until it ends. I did not know what it was about,people told me it was shocking. I was thrilled like never before,like a fast roller-coaster. when it was over I was like whoa,I was speechless, I was blown away by the unbelievable performance of 14-year-old Ellen Paige,and the sickening torture sequences. Every guy's nightmare,and I was truly uncomfortable.I pitied the guy, he was sick and thoughtless, but still it was a very very extreme way to show him how bad he is. From the minute I realized what's happening,I could not move, I was shocked and terrified. You don't know if he's guilty, or if Hailey(Paige)is just completely insane. But you discover at the end she dosen't care if he's a pedophile, she just wants him die and suffer for his sick thoughts. She seemed like a nice,cool,mature,charming girl but she had this sadistic plot to destroy this man's life from the very beginning. he dosen't seem like a pedophile, he's a photographer,but he makes the worst mistake by taking her back to his place,and fixing her up a drink. she turns the tables and stops the sadistic plan she thinks he has up his sleeve. the end was just nail biting,jaw dropping. if you want to be shocked and terrified, rent this. a whole new spin on Internet dangers of chat rooms.

The twists and turns in the story, the fading masks of the characters, it all comes together in a beautifully done showdown. It's a unique picture and flawless delivered by very talented actors, leading lady is, of course, Ellen Page. While Lohan is too busy getting off the drugs and Knightley fights off the food that's wandering towards her stomach, this short young lady is becoming the next Hepurn. She finds a capable opposite in Patrick Wilson. Their duel is dripping of tension! I hate Sandra Oh but that's not her fault.This is a movie that reminds us of the old meaning of terror, far away from guys with long beards and a sight smell of camel. A really great exhibit of the probably darkest sides of humanity.",Hard Candy
231,hani_78696,Disturbing and Engaging,7,23 August 2013,"It is one of the most disturbing and engrossing movies. It sure does holds our attention after watching it and it is a perfect one time watch movie. The highlight of the movie is lead performances by Ellen Page and Patrick Wilson. About Page,she did her job so good.One of the most creepiest performances. She looks so sweet and act grievously,she really is a hard candy in the movie.She is one of the natural actors. Patrick Wilson too well-acted the character of a pedophile who got has been stuck with an insane girl who kills pedophile. His depiction of anger,pain and surprise is really great. The cat and mouse game holds us onto the edge our seats. The plot is totally unpredictable and many scenes amazes us throughout the movie. Changing frequency and shaky camera style in some scenes is also dazzling. Writers picked a controversial topic and with a low-budget they turned it into a capricious suspense thriller. If there were no flaws it would been the one of the best thrillers. Character development and repetition of same dialogues i.e.""You are a pedophile"" ""No i am not"" ""You killed her"" ""i didn't kill her"" etc. seems cheesy. Though the plot is unpredictable it is a bit crumby in scenes. But it is great two time watch movie. I enjoyed it. Hats off to Patrick Wilson and Ellen Page.",Hard Candy
232,reid-hawk,pretty much trash,4,6 November 2016,"Hard Candy is a movie supposedly about the empowerment of rape victims and the metaphorical (as well as somewhat literal) neutering of rapists. But, all this movie really does is glorify a psychopath and show off some good ole-fashion torture. The movie's first flaws come immediately at the start of the film. Ellen Page's character is typing on a computer, except there are moments where the computer keys make noises even while she is not typing them, and the hand-held camera shakes and bobs up and down for no reason.This exemplifies two reoccurring flaws with the film: a lack of attention to detail as well as stylistic failure. The movie has many, goofs in it... very many. And its stylistic choices usually have little to no reason for being included other than the fact that to the director they probably ""look cool"". Some do, like the change from bright and exciting colors when Ellen Page's character first comes to her ""new friend's"" house to dull and grey after she drugs him and ties him up. The film also does a good job with accentuating tension by showing the beads of sweat across Patrick Wilson's character's face accumulate as he gets more and more nervous. However, these minor victories pale in comparison to the overall failure of its mistaken style choices. Things like randomly sped up shots,hand held usage, close ups, and so on and so forth only seem to be in the film to make it seem artistic without actually having any real purpose. While the movie is a tour-de-force for Ellen and Patrick's acting abilities, the character Ellen plays is garbage. Is she really any better than the rapist she tortures? I mean the movie seems to believe so, but in reality she's a complete psychopath. She literally calls her friend in the middle of a torturing session and acts completely calm and relaxed. She never once shows sympathy for any of her actions. Not even for causing the questionable death of the man she believes to be a rapist. She shows all the hallmark characteristics of a sadist and a sociopath, yet the film ends on a high-note seemingly signifying her as a hero. There is nothing heroic about her actions in the slightest. She is as much of a villain as the rapist is, yet the film claims that she is a hero. overall this movie is below average and doesn't deserve your time",Hard Candy
233,peter-ramshaw-1,Wow,9,23 January 2007,"What a great film.Suspense to the max and a good deal of fair play to boot. I admit this sort of creep-ed me out at the start as I felt a bit sick with the obvious pedophile route this was traveling... I'm glad I stuck with it though as both actors are terrific and the twists and turns are expertly done.This is one move that shows that 'horror' isn't just about zombies and vampires. Both the characters in this superb drama are horrific individuals in their own way and, in the end, you can't help but think they deserved each other.The only thing that would (I think) have made it better was if the girl had been shot by the neighbor of police on the roof after hanging the guy. Getting off Scot-free is a bit lame (think sequel here of course).",Hard Candy
234,okami_ito,"Overambitous, preachy and boring.",3,10 May 2006,"It's impossible to comment on this movie without spoilers, so if you haven't seen it you better not read the next passage. (If you belong to the kind of audience that is satisfied with ONE (yep, just one) little (ad: very) surprise). In Hard Candy a teenage girl (14 years old) takes revenge on a pedophile that probably has killed a friend of hers. First she seduces him to be taken to his apartment, then she drugs him and ties him up. After a lot of talking the girl castrates the man with a pair of scissors and finally talks (oh yeah she's talking A LOT) him into committing suicide. That's it! End of story! I had the opportunity to watch this movie at some kind of presentation and while watching it i asked myself: ""Who would pay money to watch a child molester (or even killer) being castrated by an endlessly babbling young girl?"" The only answer i found: ""Pedophiles would!"" In this movie they have the chance to gaze for about two hours at a young actress who is playing a role like her life depends on it. She endlessly delivers sarcastic one-liners, which have to be funny because a teenager is delivering them. But she's just talking lines here. It's totally unbelievable. Besides being cute by being a cynic the girl preaches against pedophilia. Thanks to this movie i finally know that it's a very bad thing indeed. It destroys lives! The problem of ""Hard Candy"" is not that it is overlong, pretentious and boring. The problem is that it's an entirely male fantasy about revenge (""Someone should cut their balls off!"") which has to be staged by a young girl. Don't get me wrong, Ellen Page is doing an impressive job here (Patrick Wilson is good, too) but the better she acts, the more annoying in its bigotry is the script she has to depend on. In the end ""Hard Candy"" with all its superficial gloss is the work of a pure reactionist in every sense of the word.",Hard Candy
235,Art Snob,Best deterrent movie ever?,10,1 May 2006,"I saw two movies over the last weekend of April -- FLIGHT 93 and HARD CANDY  and while they were both good, it's no contest as to which one provided the most visceral, edge-of-your-seat viewing experience: HARD CANDY by a mile.I go for hardball fare as a rule, eschewing most of today's cookie-cutter PG-13 cineplex stuff. I'm a particular connoisseur of bad guys (and gals), maintaining that they're what ""make"" a movie  that without them, good guys would be irrelevant. And this film features a star-is-born performance by newcomer Ellen Page, who, at the tender age of 17 (when the movie was filmed) has achieved the ultimate status an actress can aspire to in my book  a certified ""psycho bitch,"" every bit the equal of Glen Close's Alex Forrest and Kathy Bates' Annie Wilkes.You know the basic plot synopsis by now: web perv creep goes shopping for jailbait online, hooks up with a bright but seemingly-naive teenager, takes her home, and gets some surprise comeuppance. But man, WHAT comeuppance! Believe me, any web predator who sees this movie is going to have some MAJOR second thoughts before doing something he shouldn't! The film is almost entirely a two-character play, with Patrick Wilson capably handling the part of the 30-something predator opposite Page playing a 14-year-old. He's fine in his part  the film wouldn't work if he wasn't  but his main feat is riding an emotional roller-coaster worthy of Six Flags. Page gets all of the film's killer one-liners and is clearly the one in control. And despite all the talkiness, the film never drags, thanks to the quality of the dialogue and superb editing.If you're the squeamish type of viewer -- or even a Bill O'Reilly-style movie wuss -- don't go NEAR this movie! Consider it to be plutonium! But if, like me, you pride yourself on being able to handle hardball fare that others can't, definitely check it out  this is the kind of no-holds-barred fare that only comes along a couple of times a decade.And checking it out will also introduce you to an amazing new talent whose career can ONLY take off as a result of this film. Page is already scheduled to appear in X-MEN 3, and after seeing her performance in HARD CANDY, I can only say that I find her ""claws"" a lot more fearsome than Wolverine's!",Hard Candy

I hated both characters and actually wanted the guy to kill this sociopathic girl. I'm still not sure the guy really did anything, but this girl will go Hannibal Lector on the world if given a chance. Even that statement makes it seem as if there's something to watch in this vile film. There isn't. It's stupid and the ending is stupid. Incredibly stupid.

The characters are interesting, and you don't mind spending the time with them, listening to their back and forth, and their stories.The cinematography is very artsy and creative, and does add to the stilted awkwardness between them.Unfortunately, this movie does fall victim to a lot of irritating horror movie cliches - Patrick Wilson feebly crawling on the floor, not killing her, or at least tying her up or leaving the house when he has the chance. I find the ending somewhat unrealistic and silly too. Why would he choose to kill himself and trust that she'll follow through and ""delete everything""? Why not just take a chance and call her bluff? I'm sure he wasn't thinking clearly as he was frazzled, but that ending still peeves me a little.None of the aforementioned detracts enough from the film to ruin it though, as it's still a good movie.

238,ilikeweirdstuffs,Violence glorified in a moralizing movie... but,2,19 August 2021,"I reserve ratings of 3 and under for movies that could have a negative real life impact.Putting aside the awful unbelievable plot, the plotholes, and the glorification of vigilante justice and torture for a moment, here's a fun fact: In most of Europe Haley would be considered of legal age. Even taking pictures would be legal in germany, so much so, that popular youth magazine ""Bravo"", even published self taken naked pictures of teens back when this movie came out. It has been a staple of youth culture. This means people don't have such a visceral reaction to Jeff being accused. If you can't understand what this looks like to europeans, imagine if the movie was about someone pressuring a gay person into suicide with blackmail and torture, because they are suspected by someone of having killed their romantic partner.Watched with this in mind the whole shock factor is put aside, and one can actually look at the merits of the movie. Of which there are basically none, while the ""shrewd"" vigilantism of the main character appears more creepy than anything else.As to why two stars and not one? Because to those actually willing to see the movie as it is, it shows exactly how awful and dangerous vigilantism is. It is absolutely perfect at portraying the feverish and self obsessed smug vigilante. The ending makes it clear that two people were tortured and are now dead thanks to Hailey, at least one of whom was most likely not even guilty of the murder. But this isn't very emphasized, so even if this was the intention it falls short.-Had she had actual evidence, with him being portrayed as clearly bad, with the same amount of disgusting psychopathy on her part, it could have been thought provoking about whether or not torturing someone to death is allowable even for the most heinous crimes.-Had she been portrayed as less sympathetic, and him as more, with the same amount of ambiguity about the situation, people could have actually rooted for the accused guy regardless of what he did or did not do. Teaching the lesson that maybe being a psycho vigilante isn't the solution, even to difficult problems, and that dehumanizing criminals and suspects is an evil thing.-But as it stands, despite no real evidence and her being a psycho, at the end she sort of had her strategy justified, because he admitted to some involvement and she was portrayed as sympathetic throughout. This means that overall the movie just gets people used to any sort of vigilante violence against those accused of bad things to be totally great and successful, while also having the yucky feeling of feeling sympathy for a potential child murderer. Which is horrible.",Hard Candy
239,rust37,False gem,6,18 October 2006,"I ended watching Hard Candy with a sad disgust of being cheated and forced. It tried to imply too many tricks at once, and failed in each of them due to numerous exaggerations.Sentencing of pedophilia? No, you end sympathizing to the Wolf. Sure it was the big idea, nothing special though. Hyper-intellectual 14-old victim wins the mind game? I see at least two exaggerations here so I'd rather believe in teletubbies. OK, I can still accept even this for the sake of the art. Sick girl obsessed with punishment leads pedophile to deathbed repentance? Again it's something self-excluding here. Controversy of good intentioned evil eating evil? Man, isn't this too much? Finally, 32-old cynical guy is so pathetic to do what he did in the name of a big love? Sorry, I'm fed up.Girl's acting is false although the initial idea of playing naive yet overly intellectual lolita was quite promising. Camera and editing were both very impressive. Well, at least the eye candies for 2 hours of torturing my patience.

240,screamingfoot,Very Much A Fairy Tale,6,26 September 2006,"When watching this film you have to keep reminding yourself that the protagonist is 14 years old.I don't know what parallel universe the writer of this story lives in, but when I think of ALL the 14 year olds I know or have met (honors students or not), I see young people who are dumb as babes. The fact that the female lead not only has the knowledge, intellect, and balls to carry out all that she does, AND the muscle to do it, pretty much places this film in the fantasy genre in my opinion.Most 14 year olds couldn't FedEx an envelope without a detailed explanation of how to do it, and even then, they'd screw it up.There is a slickness in regards to the cinematography and art direction that, for me, reduces the impact of the story. Also the leads are good looking people and their banter is too, too eloquent... or something. Especially the 14 year old girl, who for some strange reason has the vocabulary of a 45 year old man.I had no issues with the ""torture"" or whatever, but I'm sorry, I just can't get past the implausibilities of the lead girl's characterization.",Hard Candy

242,schism101,disturbing and brilliantly acted film (POSSIBLE SPOILERS),9,9 July 2006,"HARD CANDY deals with the touchy subject of pedophilia and the internet. The film begins with a close up shot of a computer screen and an internet chat room messenger board, the conversation being between thonggirl and lensman. Lensman is the trying to get thonggirl to meet up with him. Thonggirl eventually does and they meet up in a coffee shop. We learn that thonggirl is hayley (ellen page)a 14 year old intelligent and bright teenager and lensman is jeff (patrick Wilson) a 32 year old photographer. They talk about literature, music and photography, then jeff entices hayley back to his place to let her listen to a bootlegged goldfrapp concert mp3. She goes back to his place and they exchange more talk, and drink alcohol, courtesy of jeff, until hayley shows her true reasons for going back to jeff's house. Hayley drugs and ties him up, with the intention of exposing him as a pedophile. The role reversal of hayley being the hunter and jeff being the hunted is what drives the interesting element of this film. The director, David Slade, and screenwriter, Brian Nelson, handle the subject very well, and treat it with sensitivity and without being sensational or exploitative. The actors, are both brilliant in there roles. Wilson, offers a depth to his character, yes he is a monster, but there might be reasons for his behaviour whether through a lost love, his role as a fashion photographer filming teenage models or through a chidhood incident. Page also deserves credit for bringing an interesting and complex character in Hayley. Again we are unsure whether what she is doing is right or whether she is probably disturbed, these questions keep popping up and leave the audience to decide whether Hayley is an avenging angel out to rid the world of the pedophile menace or if she is someone whose actions may and have crossed the line, and whose actions border on the psychotic. Also another interesting point is that the use of the photos in Jeffs house, of teenage models, could be seen as an attack on the fashion industry's use of teenage almost child like models dressed up to look as sexy young and attractive women, that Jeff's possible actions could have been prompted by the pictures he has all over his house. HARD CANDY is an interesting and complex film that will leave you talking about it after the end credits have rolled, which is obviously the intention of the filmmakers and it also certainly has contention as being one of the best films of the year.",Hard Candy
243,Filmfan-NL,Spinechillingly close to home,8,21 May 2007,"Rarely do I see a movie that leaves me feeling uneasy. Be it a gross horror flick, a sadistic psycho thriller or a dramatized war crime story. Hard Candy on the other hand managed to choke me. I think the fact I hadn't seen (or didn't remember seeing) Helen Page or Patrick Wilson in action added to the effect: one simply hasn't got a perspective yet on who's behind the characters they play. I was astound to find Page was in fact about 20 years old when the movie was shot. I believed in her as a 14 year old. What's most disturbing about the movie is the adult intelligence and logic applied by an emotionally immature and unstable girl. Today's world to me has many of these traits. Hard Candy capitalizes on the mixed signals today's youngsters send, probably often without knowing it themselves. It's feasible any adult could have a hard time dealing appropriately with youths dressing in today's fashion, superficially behaving like they're adults. Therefore, initially, I had a hard time not identifying with Jeff Kohlver, thus feeling guilty and dirty, at least in part. The cherry on the shivers-up-my-spine cake is the meticulous planning, preparation and execution of Hailey's 'project'. The film has hardly any visual gore in it and can hold its own well without it. In fact it helps keeping the feeling how thin the line between truth and fiction can be. Camera-work fully matches the clinical story in my opinion, and the film's pace is spot on.

244,cracker,Dumb Feminist Empowerment Fantasy,2,24 July 2012,"Saw this on the pay per view. Not much of a horror movie, more likely intended as a ""kult classic"" among junior college Women's Studies departments across the vast diploma mill hinterland. Can't imagine any realistic audience for it elsewhere.Most likely made as a crafty ""white knight"" technique to seduce earnest feminists not much older than the thoroughly implausible protagonist. Sweet irony.Tedious, plodding, low budget without charm, the only suspense is will she castrate the guy or not? and after about five minutes of it, the viewer just doesn't care. I'm sure the vamp/bad gurl HS crowd loves it. Avoid, even if you get it for free on pay per view.",Hard Candy
245,JWBly,Superb thriller,9,26 December 2011,"What can I say? Mesmerizing! I had never heard of this film before today, but I highly recommend it. It is a crime that it was not better publicized at the time of its release. Ellen Page (of Juno fame) gives an exceptional performance as the 14 year old girl who matches wits with a deadly pedophile. No special effects here - this movie is completely driven by dialogue and story, both of which will have you on the edge of your seat. Despite being 18 at the time, Page looks and acts the part of a 14 year old girl to perfection - and beyond. I will not put any spoilers in here, other than to say there were several interesting plot twists that caught me completely off guard. Page's story is vaguely reminiscent of Clint Eastwood's role in High Plains Drifter, in that her back-story is only a series of subtle hints. Is she even real? You be the judge, but watch this film. It's worth it.",Hard Candy
246,As_Cold_As_Ice,A really tense and thrilling movie,8,12 June 2007,"I recently got this pretty much because it sounded interesting. I was surprised by how good it was.The basic story is a sleazy guy picks up a 14 year old chick in a chat room, and she goes to his house. Of course more happens then that, but that would reveal too much of the shenanigans a-happening.The first thing that struck me oddly enough was the brilliant acting, especially by the chick, but the guy was really good too. Other than that, there are barely any other actors, and only a couple with speaking lines (like Sandra Oh), and this shows how good the two main figures are. If the acting was even average in this, it wouldn't have been good. The cinematography was also really good, with symbolic colours and the like. It is really a gorgeous film to watch.This is possibly the most tense and thrilling movie I have ever seen. Just wait until you get about half way through, there is a patch that had me recoiling in horror. And the best thing is that there is barely a drop of blood in the entire movie, which makes the above even more impressive.The actual plot itself was interesting enough to retain interest for 105 minutes, and I enjoyed the many small twists and turns in the script immensely.Overall, I really enjoyed this, and have no hesitation to recommend this to all horror fans.8/10",Hard Candy

The story is arravege for a thriller but its still watchable. At first I thought the guy was the main villain in this film but in the end I kinda of felt sorry for him after he had been touched by that 14 year old girl. I realized that girl was the true villain of this movie as she had a sick bitered mind which I knew all along that she was the villain in the entire movie. overall not one of the greatest thrillers I have seen but its wroth a watch 7/10",Hard Candy
248,nbwritersinbox,Noble : But Flawed,5,6 March 2011,"I'll admit, I was completely cowardly... I read as many user reviews about this film as possible, before offering a critique. Why? Because when attempting assessment of controversial material, its a good idea to find the ""middle ground"".As one would suspect, reviewers either loved or hated this movie. Since we're on a movie review site, I found myself thinking: Is this an eerie, atmospheric shocker like Polanski's work? No... Hard Candy is shocking in places, but lacks atmosphere and an eerie edge due to its setting.Do we have a tense and driven psychological thriller in the style of Hitchcock? Not really... Although there's moments when Hard Candy is nearly as good, this movie lacks the subtle symbolism and driven power of Hitchcock at his best.So, what are we left with? Well... A noble but flawed project, I think. Noble because mainstream movies so very rarely attempt to grapple with difficult issues like internet pedophilia and (female) sadism. Flawed because of the writing.The central ethos of Hard Candy asks us to accept that torture and mental cruelty is an acceptable outcome, when victims ""turn"" and become the attackers-that-were-attacked. The film-makers are over-manipulative here, because they know many of us wish to see dangerous sexual criminals roasted over a hot fire - but this is a medieval idea - and does not prevent crime...Faulty logic is at work when victim becomes attacker (albeit in a different way). It's a kind of vigilante-style response, much loved by film-makers (because of it's simple, direct message). Yet, the real issues as to why crime occurs are overlooked. In fact, the real issues are side-stepped completely in Hard Candy.Why Hayley is so driven, organized and determined to reek vengeance on this hapless photographer isn't clear to me - I think the inference is that she knew (or was) one of Jeff's victims. We have to wait to the end of the movie for this vital information - The wait's a long one and it seemed fudged. The characters' back stories just aren't well-developed enough for us, the audience, to make clear judgments about whom we should be supporting. Stephen King's characters, for example, are much more rounded and believable.",Hard Candy

It would be nice to see what this dirrector could do with a bigger budget. This should be a landmark to all people dreaming of being a film-maker starting with little to no cash. The story was full of twists and turns, so much that you almost feel bad for the antagonist. My only critique is that the director could have taken things further. I think there could have been more things discovered than the protagonist expected, thus making things more difficult for them to succeed. I wont say any more because I hate spoiling surprises!

Really acting wise this movie is very good both actor are so good that I can't even explain. This movie is released in 2005 and I watched in 2016 and still I really love this movie.

The set is beautiful and the camera angles are interesting and beautiful.

Known but 'not-spoiled-because-of-their-fame' actors, and a clear vision ... that's all you need to make good cinema.When Hayley meets Geoff at a coffee-house after a couple of weeks of online chatting, the tension can be cut with a knife. The problem is, she's 14, he's 33. But, he's a photographer and she's a willing model, so the action quickly moves to his (really nice) house.And that's where it gets dark, really dark. SO dark, it's hard to find the balance between genuinely gruesome and psychological, and just plain grotesque. So, as always, it's going to be a personal thing whether or not you completely lose yourself in the, sometimes very, over-the-top storytelling.The camera-work and overall design of the film did remind me of ""One Hour Photo"". It's very calm and cool, and the camera only goes berserk when the action is driven up.No bad comments on the acting either. Patrick Wilson (who I'd only ever seen before in ""Angels in America"") does a terrific job of making us doubt about the nature of his character. Ellen Page goes slightly overboard as a 'tough' (understatement of the year) 14 year old but still delivers the goods in a believable way. Perhaps Sandra Oh deserved a little more screen time, but that's just a detail.If you can look beyond the slightly over-stylized setting, it's an extremely well-made debut that deserves all the attention and word of mouth it can get.",Hard Candy

257,selenedm999,really really uncomfortable***contains spoilers****,7,6 October 2006,"I find that the picture on the DVD cover/poster pretty much says it all: a ""red riding hood"" type (little girl being chased by wolves) in the middle of a bear trap.I used to work for lawyers, and there's something called a ""bear trap"" law in Canada. It's called that because it's difficult to understand and even more difficult to legislate, and there's no real way out of it.Hence the reason the bear trap is a great visual metaphor: you're caught in a very painful situation, and the only way out is to chew off your leg. Hm...It's hard to explain what this movie is about without giving away the plot, so here goes: a teenage girl picks up a 32-year-old photographer, then accuses him of both paedophilia and the murder of a local missing girl. Instead of calling the cops on his ass, she ties him to a table under threat of castration. THEN things get really nasty...I thought the movie was great. The friend I was watching it with hated it and didn't think it was possible. Note--I learned about castration on the Body Modification Extreme website; if I know how it's done, why wouldn't she? I've frequently had the discussion about ""the punishment for sex crimes/paedophilia/rape should be violence/castration/etc."" I don't agree, personally, but I understand the place of anger and victimization that argument comes from, and I thought the lead character was plausibly portrayed. She has a child's sense of immediate vengeance, without thought of the consequences, and an adult's access to every excess imaginable. Scary stuff.It's a movie that's meant to make you uncomfortable. It's shot without much music, and it draws you in with beautiful images, solid acting, and an excellent script. And the best thing about the movie is you don't know who to sympathize with--if you sympathize with her, you're as psychotic as she is. If you sympathize with him, you're on the side of what most people consider the lowest form of human life, someone who preys on children. However, he IS oddly sympathetic, partly because it's never really proved, but also because one thing we're supposed to learn as adults is compassion for ALL living things. Also scary stuff.Considerably better than your average ""rape revenge"" fantasy, MUCH better than your average slasher movie, and not for the faint of heart.",Hard Candy

I was hoping she would not go that far, but the writers and director really build up the tension to this dramatic and horrific scene. It's what you don't see which works so well.These two character are both efficient and convincing of their roles, although the female character knowing so much at the tender age of 14 is a bit hard to believe.I'm sure the sadness and cruelty was all intended by the directors. but I have absolutely no reason to go back and give it a second watch.",Hard Candy

It's not about gender; It's not about sex justice; It's not about crime & punishment. It's merely a mess the makers made to force the film stand out among so many indie films in a so pathetic way. I always regard myself a thinker when it comes to a good film. But this time I don't want to think about the plot itself -- It's neither entertaining or inspiring but sickly raw. Although I don't share the common guilty with Jeff (at least not now...), but I'm not quite sure in the days coming I won't hate or be afraid of teenage girls with short hairs and smooth tongue--not because the film successfully portrays the character, but for as obviously enough a reason as that you get sick, for the rest of your life, of somebody violently sweared to you without a cause.However, one point to its visual style, that's all.

263,VoiceOfEurope,little red riding devil,7,13 April 2007,"14-year-old Hayley, aka Thonggirl18, indulges in coquettish chit-chat over the internet and very consentingly gets seduced by a charming, young photographer who has apparently made something close to deservedly be called a fortune under the Hollywood signpost. He has the manner, the pedigree, the wits and a penchant for designer suits. She meets him in a candy shop and after a brief conversation full of static they end up in his stylish hillside apartment. But soon it turns out it is not her who has been sweet-talkingly picked by him, it is more like the other way round. Not long after she has been shown around the place he is about to pass out amidst rather strange circumstances. Even more frightening is his predicament he finds himself in when he comes to. He is strapped to a table confronted by an accusing, headstrong young girl in possession of a cluster of surgical tools. Hayley claims she knows what he has done to her missing girlfriend. What is more, she proclaims herself to be the avenging spirit of all sexually molested, wrongly abused gullible juveniles ever to have fallen victims to sexual predators and soulless pedophiles. It slowly sinks in for Jeff that his afternoon will only get more bizarre can he not talk his way out of the unpleasant situation. But the poor bastard does not stand a chance, because she is more of a smooth-talker than a pin-stripe suited Warren Beatty and more resourceful than all the US government agencies and the whole Ivy League combined together. David Slade's first notable feature film is way beyond provocative, it is revolting. It is very finely photographed, nicely paced but so unreal that at times it wrenched my hand into a fist. How could a 14-year-old continuously outfox a thirty-something intellectual she does not even know and con him into much unwanted things? What starts out as a realistic take on a sensitive subject turns into a pretentious, upsettingly obnoxious piece, communicating the wrong message to youths. Hayley's supercilious and self-indulgent behaviour and the way she conquers Jeff in every aspect could serve as a way of self-justification for unrespectful, antisocial teenagers who think the world is for them to extort.",Hard Candy
264,tha_mongoose,Clever psychological thriller that will leave you gasping for the truth,8,17 March 2009,"Nothing said here does not already appear at least referred to in the plot summary of the film.Perhaps the most captivating (from a systematic standpoint) element of this film is the complexity of it's characters.Both Hayley Stark (Page) and Jeff Kohlver (Wilson) are much more than skin-deep. They evade any clear sketch or outline - a cubist's representation would be more apposite.The film brings into question the human creature. Is morality, ultimately, applicable in a broader sense? Are we not, in the greater scope of things, capable of any number of ""moral atrocities""? The multiplicity of viewpoints the viewer is compelled to adopt enable him (and to what purpose?) to select ever-shifting, ever more superfluous sides to a moral debate that seems to have no palpable culprit.In other words, you begin by rooting for Jeff, who seems like a guarded individual - heck, his pedophilia is initially hard to believe.Yet as things progress and - contrarily to what would be expected - the viewer's knowledge of Jeff's extracurricular activities begins to take a less ephemeral shape, we nevertheless continue to vie for Jeff.We root for what a moral code existent in today's society considers to be a freak - the man infatuated with younger girls - because suddenly the moral patrol (Hayley) seems unbalanced. Things are off the charter - she is taking law upon herself.You begin to wonder if she really has the right to proceed with her designs. Can things really to be seen from a monotone lens? In this sense the extensive coloring that took shape in the creation of the film is a touch of genius - one is left pondering whether certain scenes in the film are to be taken for reality or the stuff of dreams.Hard Candy will prove difficult to grapple with throughout; but the director makes things slightly easier for us towards the end, with the ensuing ""twists"", if you will.Still, the challenge to traditional ""right and wrong"" concepts is there. To be sure, Hayley at certain points appears mad - the strength of her resolve is crushing - scary even.Eventually, neither of the characters' stances seems right - and yet, wouldn't one be - in our traditional understanding of that situation? What would the average Joe do to a pedophile? Are they not proverbially spat on by society? Are these wretches not beaten and ostracized by the majority of us - even if only in our mind? And isn't that rightfully so? To propel a very effective and engaging, as well as masterfully-paced plot, we have the acting abilities of the protagonists - Page and Wilson, that are, in one word, perfect.No girl could portray this role as well as Ellen, unless we count European and other foreign film actors, that have shown true gems where the masses thought what Hollywood had for us was the norm (cf. Lina Leandersson in Let The Right One In (2008)).Wilson shows acting abilities which are certainly stronger than I thought previously.Do not miss this film. 8/10.",Hard Candy

Elllen Page and Patrick Wilson delivered the goods on all fronts. I can't believe I'd never heard of this film. I picked it up at Roger's Video yesterday merely to get the ""6 for"" deal. What a pleasant surprise. It is hard to categorize it; it's neither mystery, horror, black comedy or drama, but a brilliant mingling of each. There are some ""unrealistic"" feats carried out by a slip of a girl, but disbelief is easily suspended by masterful scene sequencing. This is not merely a statement piece; it has entertaining elements despite disturbing subject matter. It was pulled off in a dazzling way.

I expected a sensitive drama about child abuse, something intelligent.No one and nothing can prepare you for this movie. This is not Hostel, Wolf Creek or Touristas. This horror/sick reality film is made so good, that it's simply painful to watch. It's either a ten or a one. I decided that it would be a one.Are the filmmakers proud to have made such a movie? Do they think they do us a favor so that we can talk about it and discuss what happened here? If the girl had rights to do what she did? Seriously what do we get from this movie? Is it entertainment? For me it was surely not, you have to be out of your mind to be entertained by this. Was it inspiring? I am still a bit under shock from what I saw.Reality check: I mean we don't get into how a 14 year old girl would overcome a 32 year old guy and tie him up in a chair or stretch him out on an operating table and into a position to hang himself? Then he gets out from his chain, after the operation and it seems like it was easy. So why he did not get out before? Then at the door with the Asian woman she loses her wits suddenly? Then the guy walks around the house like nothing happened? Anyway, the filmmakers clearly let the girl get away with what she did.

267,Hotbody,Great acting! Plot... Not so hot...,5,24 April 2006,"The acting was top notch. I must say, the performance of some (Patrick Wilson and Ellen Page) of the five listed actors was phenomenal. On the other hand, if you want a plausible plot, look elsewhere. I suppose with a bit more research the writer, Brian Wilson, could have tightened up the major inconsistencies that turned an interesting premise into a movie that we tried so hard to like but could not except for the acting.The idea of a 14-year-old pedophile stalker unleashing havoc upon a 32 year old ""short eyes"" who happens to be a photographer could be somewhat appealing. However, maybe this is due to both main characters are sick individuals, the idea of common sense self preservation skills appear to be lacking. In addition, the neighbor (Sandra Oh) makes an appearance in the movie that goes absolutely nowhere, her role was completely unnecessary and added nothing to the movie.Basically, after a fair amount of creepy pedophile meets Lolita in heat kind of activity the movie starts going downhill in an ever-increasing rate. The psychological drama becomes stranger as the characters develop. The kid toucher (Jeff) pulls as many verbal tricks of manipulation that backfire under the great amusement of the psychopathic little nymph. The little girl (Hayley) is ripe with sarcasm and the occasional game being played in return.The whole thing falls apart if anyone cares to think about what they are watching. The character development leaves too many unanswered questions. The characters need much more explanation than what the movie ends with. I believe this could have been done without dumbing anything down.As it is, the movie was reasonably shot. The cliché CCD camera effects do not add anything. The premise is unbelievable due to the number flaws of the plot. The only hope for this movie is that the subject matter of the plot is ""shocking"" enough to get a little attention. However, anyone who wants a plausible and solid plot, go watch something else and hope that this movie is rewritten.",Hard Candy
268,laraemeadows,I was impressed with this film from start to finish. You will be too.,9,9 January 2007,"Hard Candy, directed by David Slade and written by Brian Nelson stars Patrick Wilson and Ellen Page, is a disturbing, empowering and emotional look at pedophilia and the lengths people will take to expose a pedophile.Wilson's character, Jeff Kohlver, begins an internet relationship with a fourteen year old girl, Hayley Stark. When Jeff meets Hayley, played by Ellen Page, in person for the first time he sets off to seduce her by making her feel special and safe. Hayley agrees to go back to his house to listen to some music.Just when you think this film is going to show us the seedy mind of a pedophile it changes to show us the seedy mind of a fourteen year old girl trying to expose a child rapist. After drugging him and humiliating him, she proceeds to do a myriad of things to convince him that this encounter is going to make him pay for the rest of his life for what he had done in the past. Hayley may well be a sociopath but you don't hate her. By the time you get to the end you are expecting it but it is still shocking and unexpected.Patrick Wilson's portrayal of the way a child molester gains the trust of and seduces a child was disturbing. Jeff's hands off approach only encouraged Hayley's flirtation and advances. All of his remarks could be taken as sexual or asexual. Even though, in the beginning, everyone watching can tell he is attracted to her and her to him, the way he seduces her is so subtle and complex it would be hard for a child to understand the advances as anything more than innocent. In the scenes where he is being tortured, and humiliated, Jeff is terrified, angry, scared, and spews attrition.Wilson's performance is nothing short of incredible. This film goes from beginning to end with a range of affect that even the most experienced actors would find challenging. Jeff is horny, lonely, seductive, silly, sultry, angry, fearful, despondent, elated, and never shameful. He acts with his entire being. At times during the torture you actually empathize with him, in spite of who he is because Wilson helps you feel his physical pain and dismay during his torment. Wilson's performance is worth seeing this movie alone.Ellen Page's performance is frightening and exciting. Page swings in and out of emotions quickly but naturally. When the film starts Hayley is sweet, insecure and open to Jeff's seduction. There is a point in the movie where you learn that both Jeff and you have been played by Hayley. She isn't sweet and innocent. She is scary, vengeful and admirable. Hayley Stark is the person we all wish we could be and are scared to become. A role like Hayley is hard to pull off well. Left to a lesser actress this role would have blown into a contrived fantasy. Page instead completely controls her composure to release only what the scene demanded; a marvelment of precise projection. Given the right role in the right film, I wouldn't be surprised if her name became one everyone knew.There is a cameo appearance from Sandra Oh as the nosey neighbor. I think it was a waste of such a great actress to give her such a strange and awkward role.Actors can only be as good as the material they act from and writer Brian Nelson's script is nothing short of engaging. He was able to make a thriller/drama about a child molester make you angry and fearful instead of sad, which is hard to do when dealing with such a disturbing topic. He also makes the characters full and completely dimensional. It is a major achievement to make a child molester's character so in depth. The writing and acting aren't the only achievements in the film. The cinematography is first class. Jo Willems understands how to use light, framing, angles, color and grit to give the right mood to the right scene. David Slade, Art Director Felicity Nove, Costume Designer Jennifer Johnson and Set Decorator Kathryn Holliday created sets completely devoid of unnecessary clutter or eye distraction. Everything that can be made of a solid color is completely one solid color. The walls are purple, the couch is black, shirts are solid colors, etc. This creates a simple world in which the complex story plays out. It also lets you know exactly what you should be looking at because they aren't simple and they really stand out.I was impressed with this film from start to finish. You will be too.PS. This question is a spoiler. Please don't read it if you haven't seen the movie. Please see the movie! At the end, is the person still on the roof a sociopath? If you believe a sociopath knows what they are doing is wrong and does it anyways, does this person fit? Or do you think what they did wasn't wrong?",Hard Candy

The girl as written by Brian Nelson is just another phony male fantasy that fits with scores of other male fantasy women written by the misogynists that rule Hollywood. Portraying this child, not as an innocent, but as an all-knowing, conniving, cunning, cruel, tormentor gives credence to pedophile's cruel delusional lie that the child seduced him, not the other way around. Worse it gives credence to another lie foisted on young women: castrating bitch.Isn't it bad enough that we live in a culture that convinces 10 year old girls that they must be ""sexy."" Do we need another movie that foists the castrating bitch theme on young women? Oh sorry, is it okay if she's doing it vigilante-style? I don't think so!",Hard Candy

What was the purpose of using a young girl for this role - i think it would have made sense to use a parent. Besides the vigilante teen, i would've love to see a more detailed background story about Haylee and her captive.

272,julioecolon,Little Red Riding Hood Corners the Wolf,8,26 November 2006,"I imagine much credit in this film is due to Jean-Clement Soret, the digital colorist, and to Jo Willems, the director of photography, for creating a rich palette of ochers, umbers, and tuscan reds that make this film a feast for the eyes. Ellen Page delivers a virtuoso performance as the avenging teenager. Her delivery is impressive both in its psychological depth and its disarming seamlessness. She is really quite brilliant. Not all casting decisions are so fortunate, however. Patrick Wilson is a bad choice for the male lead, for example. He has the smarmy, bespectacled look that fits the pedophile, but he doesn't have the rest of the package. There is never a moment, to cite the most egregious failure in his interpretation, when one sees the evil brooding beneath, and I imagine that another actor of greater talents might have been able to bring this dimension forth. Susan Oh is good as the mother too busy with her life to care for her kids, but her appearance at a critical moment in the film is not handled deftly, it seems. Any other mother of such sophistication and insight would have called the police immediately to report: Houston, we have a problem. The sound editors for the film get a D minus for making a mess of Patrick Wilson's heavy breathing scenes. Finally, the title of the film is awful. We need something that captures more the surface innocence and the underlying motivations of the teenager. Candy is too sexually-laden a term to work. Red Hood, Red Sweats, Red Fleece (something along those lines) would have been better.",Hard Candy
273,ithearod,Hard (to watch) Candy,7,5 January 2009,"Look at the movie poster, for crying out loud! It's Little Red Riding Hood in a bear trap! The reviewer who did us all the tremendous service of informing us that there is a coda to the original Grimm Bro's tale of ""The Little Red Cap"" in which the protagonist lures the wolf to fall to his death from the rooftop, cements this.I was not prepared for this movie. It is disturbing, and not just because I am a man. The ways in which Haley taunts and torments Jeff psychologically as well as physically are truly cruel and punishing.(BTW, if you're REALLY looking for a reference to Japanese pop culture, it's in there. It's the spin of the chair in the very first scene we see Jeff tied up, where Haley says, ""You think this is torture? This is nothing."" What's the reference? Go watch the first entry in the ""Guinea Pig"" series. If this movie disturbed you, stop at the first of those movies, though; you have been warned).There were lots of inconsistencies, like for example how a 14 year old girl could get a grown man strung up from the rafters while he was totally unconscious. But that's just niggling. It is a modern take on a fairy tale, after all.If you are a careful viewer, the brief but horrible power of the final scene, together with its extremely important and revealing dialogue, should carry with you long after the more obvious (but far overlong) scenes of awfulness have faded from your mind.Bonus points: who can understand the point of Sandra Oh's character in the film? Meaninglessness? You decide.",Hard Candy
274,Nuz_Reviews,A fun little psycho-thriller,7,14 July 2011,"This 2005 psychological thriller concentrates on the world of internet confrontations and sexual pedophilia. Hayley, played by EllenPage, is convinced that Jeff, actor Patrick Wilson, is a sexual predator and has what unfolds in this gruesome plot coming. Throughout this movie I found myself going back and forth trying to decide who actually is the protagonist and who is the antagonist. Perhaps that's what writer Brian Nelson wanted, who has done other TV shows. Hard Candy is quite tasteful at asking justifiable questions of the audience, so that must be just another to add to Nelson's list.Ellen Page is from movies like Inception, Juno, and X-Men 3; I was surprised that I have never seen this indy film before. She's always good in every role she plays. However, her haircut annoyed me in this movie.Patrick Wilson was the Nite Owl in Watchmen and is scheduled to star in a CBS drama entitled A Gifted Man in this upcoming 2011–12 season. I watched the exclusive preview below and it reminded me a lot of The Mentalist if Patrick Jane worked in a hospital, instead of with the CBI. Surprisingly a lot of familiar faces in this ""iffy"" preview.The movie Phone Booth came to mind when I saw Hard Candy. For the most part, both of them have only one setting, be it just in a phone booth or at Jeff's house. And, ironically they both scored a 7.2 User Rating on IMDb.The cast for the movie was only five people long in the credits. This is probably the first and only time I can list them all without providing a link to the IMDb page. But, what's the point anyways. I did recognize one of the women from the comedy Sideways though.7/10 Stars.""A fun little psycho-thriller"" ~The Nuz Journal",Hard Candy

All performances (5 of em') are excellent. And although it's a little bit talky it's still never boring. Glad I bought it. I'm also gonna admit that Ellen Page's face is haunting my mind as of late. She's really great in ""X-Men 3"" & there's just something about her that's just....well it's just haunting. I'm positive she's older than the character she plays in the movie.

277,VanRippestein,too bad. A well chance missed,1,6 November 2006,"Hard Candy is not your average movie. It's made by director David Slade, know for his videos for Warp. As a director he shows some great stuff. Nice camera-work, lightning and colors. A beauty to the eye, i'd say. The Acting to is top notch. Both Patrick Wilson and Ellen Page play believable characters who evolve throughout the film.So, why did i rated it as a 1 star film? Because the story is as weak as it can get. the director probably (i'm not really sure about it) wanted to show 2 people being wrong. pedophile and a little girl that takes revenge. And revenge is always a bad solution. But instead of showing 2 people being wrong. We are forced to see 1 person as good, and the other as bad as can be. While it might be an interesting duel, it's an all 1 way attack. Almost forcing the viewer into making 1 person a hero and the other a loser. Therefore, i'm not really sure if the director wants us to choose. If he did, he'd made both party's more balanced out in their actions. But the end of the film, clearly indicated 1 as a hero and 1 as a loser.The thing suggested here are almost unethical. To bad that the complex situation given is handled so bad. To bad that everything except the story are good. but the story is SO bad, that the whole film drowns in it. drown in hate and subjectivity, this looked like propaganda to me. in 2006 people should be more smart.",Hard Candy

Lots and lots of touchy subjects in this movie.The plot is insane (4 out of 5 doctors agree), The twist come out of nowhere, it keeps you guessing and makes you feel so much.

Learn as little about this movie as possible before seeing it, then go watch it again.",Hard Candy
279,bricslove,refreshing because sincere(politically incorrect) and that was just what I needed,9,13 November 2014,"I don't buy into the view that art is for art's sake and that it is useless so this is kind of a jab at Wilde's preface to ""the Picture of Dorian Gray"". You don't do stuff just because you can. You do it because you want to. What makes you want to do it might escape me but saying that it served no purpose/was useless just because I cannot tap into your reasons and motivations would be the same as saying God exists whenever I find the universe is a dangerous place swarming with unknowns. What Wilde intended to say is not that art is useless anyway but that its use is too relative to be of any relevance at any given discussion.What does all this have to do with Hard Candy: I find this movie refreshing in its sincerity and that's what is of use to me. If you think sincerity in a movie is among your criteria when it comes to choosing what to watch you might want to give this one a shot.Why I think it is sincere: This movie chooses to be politically incorrect as regards to its motivation, the plot through which it chooses to pass this on and the fact that what is conveyed is rather a candid admission of concern than an in-your-face, self-righteous shoving down of personal needs disguised as (part of) ""human rights"" often found to be politically approved by systems of law-making and abiding. It goes on to show that what is established as ""law"" and thus inherently implies a worldwide consensus on whatever issue at hand, is still of our making/deeming it to be so, from which it follows that statistical measures of how widely a rule has been applied has no significance in the clear judgment of the unfettered mind which seeks no place to run and hide in an attempt to circumvent genuine reason.So, yes, this simple movie made me think about all that. I don't think its sole premise is adding more to an already popular debate about paedophilia. I think it rather questions whether laws should be exempt from any further judgment and bettering just because they have come to be accepted as laws. It does so by introducing the human will and its contradicting stance into the equation (I'm not saying ""free will"" mind you). Nowhere in the movie do I see any blatant or even subtle reference to this; it's just that it's highly likely for some of you to find yourselves to be thinking as much about this aspect of the movie as about that which has already been frequently discussed on boards.This movie, to me, has shown up the hypocrisy of the concept of what is ""acceptable"" in law by choosing one of its popularly discussed controversies and applying it to a specific situation. A young and intelligent person with a vendetta is all it takes to remind people how law utterly makes no sense on one-to-one encounters and where it fails and how it's been conveniently shunned by wide-spread, self-serving, legitimized perversion. We find our privacy violated at all the wrong places, at all the wrong moments and never when we need it.Many of those people who have already seen this movie might think this review is misleading and I will still submit it.-- Beautiful soundtrack, beautiful focus and pan out of cam, didn't need to describe all that.",Hard Candy
280,FilmWeekUK,Beautifully crafted Hitchcockian Psychological Thriller,9,10 December 2006,"What's not to like about this film? Everything about it shouts ""perfectionism"", whether we're talking acting, design, dialogue, direction or cinematography. A film that is primarily two talking heads sounds like a recipe for disaster, but David Slade opens it out and delivers a cinematic masterpiece. It's rare to have a film that keeps you on the edge of the seat throughout, manages to deliver an unexpected ending that has you going ""whaaaaaaaaaat?"" but which manages to tie things up nicely while leaving you with plenty of questions to discuss around the water cooler.More importantly there's no ""cheat"" ending as there is with similar taut psychological fare like ""Flightplan"" (where the denouement is just plain silly). The film is wholly consistent throughout. Very much like Hitchcock's ""Psycho"", a second viewing of the film shows just how cleverly the director has performed his sleight of hand to misdirect you, without resorting to any kind of cheating. The use of long lenses, close-ups, transitions and music all turn what could have been a worthy-but-dull ""theatrical"" piece into something truly cinematic. In many ways the film's basic plot is very similar to ""The 24th Day"" (another excellent film) but the director and his team take the source material to a higher level so that this feels more worthy of the title ""masterpiece"" than the previous offering.The two central performances are nothing less than outstanding. Patrick Wilson deserves far more recognition than he's received so far for this performance, and shows again (see ""Angels of America"" or ""Phantom of the Opera"" or ""Little Children"" for other examples of his work) what an incredibly versatile actor he is. Ellen Page amazingly for a 19 year-old shows herself to be his equal when it comes to acting chutzpah, showing just what a waste of talent her more high-profile performance in X-Men III is.Highly recommended!",Hard Candy
281,crazy-ben66,A masterpiece overlooked by many,10,2 September 2010,"Most people overlook this brutal masterpiece based on the torture element of the plot which is a big shame. Compared to the 'torture porn' movies of late, 'Hostel', or the 'Saw' franchise for example, this is nothing. What makes this movie what it is is in fact the terrific acting and the way the film has been so beautifully shot with the blue-ish/grey tint making the colour red stand out so perfectly. Although this isn't the sort of movie to watch with young children, it's not one to be afraid of either as the intense content is handled not exactly cautiously, but artistically and tastefully.Ellen Page puts in my favourite performance of all time as Hayley Stark, and Patrick Wilson is also insanely good as Jeff the photographer. The simplicity of the setting and the sheer intensity of some of the events and the way they have been scripted go hand-in-hand to produce a movie which is not only nail-biting and in some places, shocking, but also a movie which is positively refreshing to the frankly exhausted horror/thriller genre. To conclude, watch this movie. It's no where near as gory or sickening as most people say it is, just the setting and plot alone force most to avoid it. The sheer talent put forward by the amazing Ellen Page and Patrick Wilson and Director David Slade make this possibly the most underrated movie of all time and up there with the best.

I do admit though the acting is phenomenal and worthy of praise, in fact it's so good it doesn't feel like acting at all. In saying that I found the plot to be repugnant because how far can you get morally to torture someone who harmed you before you actually become no different than them? I believe this film takes this theme to a whole other levelSpoilers ahead:If the goal of this film is to make us sympathise with the victims of pedophilia then Hard Candy failed on all counts, it actually made me really like Jeff (the pedophile), and made me wish that the truly psychotic Hayley was subjected to what she put Jeff through instead. It's hard to come to any other conclusion that the writers of this film don't like men very much as every single cliche about sexual violence was parroted and issued forth by Hayley in their dialogue together, so much so that you just wished the tables were turned around and Jeff becomes the hero. Overall I just found this film very toxic and mean spirited with NO redeeming qualities about Hayley at all, and I tried to really like her and see things from her perspective, I really did. Even though she is meant to be the victim here, I ended up siding with Jeff and I'm quite sure that's not the effect this film is supposed to have on people.

for a first moment, I felt very provocative. maybe the movie wanted to feel you that, and the truth it did. but what weakened my rating of the film, Is the end that has not largely explained the deep psychological causes of the girl's history, or even her view of justice.

286,Turriff,Between Candy and a Hard Place...,7,17 September 2007,"So, Hard Candy is a movie I've been meaning to see for a while now. I got sick over the weekend, and since the best thing to do when you're sick is to watch movies, I figured 'what the hell...' and rented some. Left to my own devices, I picked up The Wicker Man (the new one, not the old one), The Omen (also the new one, not the old one) and All the King's Men (Which, unknown to me, is also a remake, which makes it the new one as well, even though I had never heard of the old one).These choices did not go over well with the girlfriend, who isn't overly fond of the horror. She does, however, approve of All the King's Men.So, instead, we settle on Hard Candy and The Proposition (a western of sorts, which she also doesn't like, but since I'm sick...).I'll deal with Hard Candy here, and we'll look at the other two later sometime.The first thing that I have to say about Hard Candy is that it feels like a small movie. It's subtle, but I couldn't shake the feeling the whole time I was watching it. I don't want to imply that this takes away from the movie in any way, as it doesn't, but I felt it needed mentioning.The second thing say is that watching this movie is a little uncomfortable, because pedophilia always makes me a little uncomfortable. Even Lolita (the book), which is a classic, made me a little uncomfortable (even if it was a critique, right, Angie?).That having been said, there is no doubt that this movie delivers on all fronts. While the exposition is a bit dialogue heavy, it sets the stage quickly for what is a tense, smart psychological thriller. Well paced, well shot, well acted. Without spoiling to much of the story, the setup is unique, gratifying in the end, and extreme enough to shock at times.So, while a few things bothered me, overall I enjoyed the movie. It's a definite Rent it if you like psycho-thrillers, or if you like to see bad people have bad things done to them. Coincidentally, I think that might apply to The Proposition as well, but I'll get to that later.The Girlfriend said she liked it, even though she missed some of it cuz she was making me soup (I was sick, after all, remember?).",Hard Candy
287,rstarzecmoviecritic,Ahead of Its Time,7,8 August 2019,"""Hard Candy"" is a revenge film that puts masculinity in its place, and if it would have been released more recently than 2005, it would be highly appreciated in this era of the MeToo movement. It clearly has a low budget when you are viewing it, but it is quite entertaining to watch a pedophile get what is coming to him, and a very young Ellen Page dominates with her humorous yet intimidating performance. This movie is a nightmare for men and a triumph for young women, but it is a mediocre one at best.The best aspect of ""Hard Candy"" is Ellen Page's unrelenting performance as a mentally disturbed 14-year-old girl who goes by the name Hayley. She is set out to destroy a photographer named Jeff (Patrick Wilson) whom she believes to be a pedophile. In the first fifteen minutes of the movie or so, Hayley is able to keep her composure as she puts on an act for Jeff. Once they agree to meet in public we are introduced to both characters, and Hayley seems ignorant and flirtatious, the type of girl that would be an easy and obvious target for a pedophile. Hayley even ""jokes"" with Jeff, saying 4 out of 5 doctors have diagnosed her as being insane. Once she drugs Jeff and ties him up to a chair at his own place, we see that she was being serious. Her demeanor completely changes as she holds Jeff hostage at his own home. She is demanding, ruthless, angry, and as she is with Jeff longer and longer, she has this matter-of-fact-ness to her that makes her performance pretty funny as well. She speaks with Jeff as if nothing out of the ordinary is happening, which makes her that much more creepy.The story itself is a little too simple that it makes it a bore to watch after a while. Once Hayley has Jeff tied down in his home, we learn that the story is that she is going to investigate his place in order to prove whether or not he has child pornography and whether or not he was involved in the murder of a young girl. If the answer to either of those questions is yes, then she is going to torture him. She knows that he is a photographer who specializes in taking photos of models who are under the age of 18, but Hayley still needs to prove that this type of behavior goes beyond his profession.The first two acts are long and are only mildly entertaining, but the third act proves to be a pretty good pay-off for all that waiting. Towards the end of act two and throughout the whole third act, the filmmakers do a great job at maintaining a feeling of tension, and on several different levels at that. The movie ends rather abruptly after the climax, but it is not a fault for the movie since it feels it should end that way, and to extend the third act would only drag it out.What is most respectable about ""Hard Candy"" is that it is bold in its effort to tie in masculinity with a perverted nature of sorts, and even if Hayley's character does not reflect a traditional definition of femininity, it is a joy to watch her make a pedophile's life a living hell. The movie may only be mediocre, but it is also ahead of its time.7/10",Hard Candy

It turns out that the meeting is more than what the guy bargained for.The story is carried by the acting of both Ellen Page and Patrick Wilson. Despite the fact that his character is a pedophile, Wilson makes him believable and sympathetic. Page does an excellent job in shifting gears from seemingly sweet and innocent, to cold, calculating, intelligent and vindictive.If there are any weak points in the movie, it would have to be with the camera work.

292,steveh46,Disturbing movie,8,13 November 2008,"First, this IS an extremely disturbing movie. I can understand both the people who hated it and those who really liked it. Page and Wilson are terrific in their roles and I don't find the premise wholly unbelievable though there are some things that stretch my willingness to suspend disbelief. But, on the whole, it's an intelligent film and worthwhile. Here there be spoilers, so don't proceed unless you want to know or already know what happens.Probably the most disturbing feature of the film is that the pedophile/murderer becomes a more sympathetic figure than his intended ""victim."" I think that this is because Jeff basically tells the truth (or mostly the truth) throughout the movie while Hayley lies all the time. I believe that nothing Hayley says is true; she isn't 14 (she could be anywhere from 16-19), she isn't the daughter of a med school professor, she doesn't have an older sister who dropped her off at Nighthawks, etc. What Hayley is is a victim of a pedophile and she has set out to discover and punish pedophiles who prey on girls who are the age she was when she was victimized. She is brilliant, but she isn't a brilliant 14 year old. Page was 17 when she played the role, and no matter how smart Hayley is, she isn't a 14 year old.Jeff obviously lies about his part in the disappearance of Diane and about his sexual desires for teenage girls. But I believed the story about his aunt and cousin was true and so were many of the other things he said, especially when he told Hayley that she would always remember what she was about to do and regret it if she went ahead. He was speaking from personal experience, but that didn't stop him from pursuing girls.In addition, Jeff's reactions are recognizably human but Hayley is totally remorseless throughout, with the exception of a momentary expression of exhaustion or self-disgust when she is at the kitchen sink.The scenes of Jeff, bound and helpless and being psychologically tortured by Hayley, are the most disturbing in the film. His helplessness makes him more sympathetic than the relentlessly manipulative Hayley especially since, for much of the movie, we're not quite certain whether Jeff is a pedophile or murderer. These scenes are probably the reason that most people dislike the movie. (Many males probably have a visceral disgust for the castration scenes.) But we never see any ""real blood"" and very little violence. I find the torture porn movies, like Saw and Hostel, far more disturbing precisely because of the lack of character development, because the actors are just empty pawns whose pain is meant to titillate the audience. Jeff's very real terror evokes more real emotion and is therefore more disturbing to those who might not mind Saw.The weakness in the film is that I found it hard to believe that Hayley would be able to physically dominate the far larger, stronger Jeff even after drugging him. Page is petite and Hayley would have had to lug around a large and totally unconscious body. Especially stringing him up in the kitchen seemed unlikely.I'd be interested in the reaction of women vs. men in their feelings on the movie. Men are probably uncomfortable with the castration scenes and the ease with which Hayley entices and manipulates Jeff sexually. Hits pretty close to men's fears.But, if you're willing to watch and especially if you don't know the story going in, it's a very thought-provoking film.",Hard Candy
293,YT_RealJoshTv,I gave it about 30 minutes,4,8 June 2020,"Once the basic setup is underway, I was exhausted and wanted to turn it off. The beginning is okay and I like Patrick Wilson, I don't mind Ellen Paige, but she is awful here. Once you see her macho side it just doesn't hit or register, not believable. And there really isn't enough evidence or proof this guy doing much wrong. If we had seen him commit terrible acts to her or another girl, the vengeance seems justified.After about 30 minutes I skimmed through the rest of the movie after reading spoilers. Maybe more for girls but even then there isn't enough good storytelling to by the revenge. So sad my time was wasted",Hard Candy
294,bongo-6,A sick film?,4,11 April 2006,"Why is this film sick? Well to start off it doesn't deal with the issues; it seems to say the way to treat paedophiles is to castrate them; it says don't go to the police take the law into your own hands; it also has a smart mouthed 14 year old girl in the lead who we, as the audience, are not too sure about; is she mad or is she hell bent on some kind of mission or revenge? She also has the dialogue of a mature woman when she should be speaking like a 14 year old - bad dialogue writing Mister Nelson.In the movie 'Misery' the audience has sympathy for the writer who has been kidnapped by a stalker; in this film we learn early on that the paedophile has been stalked but after the initial exuberance of his capture our sympathies seem to change when he is abused and tortured. We have to dispel belief when they cut to a scene and we see him in a position that would take two grown men to put him into; we have to ask ourselves how a girl of less than 110 pounds lifts a 200 pound man onto a table and stands him up when he is unconscious  now how did she do that? However, the direction and cinematography are brilliant and there is a technique in one of the tracking shots, used a couple of times, when we go around the table, out through a door and back into the room through another door to look at the scene from the other side of the room, which looks very impressive; there are also semi strobe like affects in a couple of the action scenes which I liked.The Internet is a godsend to paedophiles and if this film does nothing else at all it points that out; it is also aimed at a young female audience, where it might do the most good, so it is a pity that it will be rated 'R' in the US and '18' in the UK.I'm not sure of the significance of the red hood which is seen on the publicity cards and posters unless it is some kind of homage to Nicolas Roeg's 'Don't Look Now' or some reference to Little Red Riding Hood, as it is only seen for a fleeting moment during the movie. There are also terrific performances from Patrick Wilson and Ellen Page in the two leading roles and a good directorial debut to feature films from David Slade but there are certain moments in this film when the audience claps at the same kind of things that were applauded in 'Thelma and Louise' which made me feel a little uneasy and 'part of the mob.' These scenes made a few male members of the preview audience last night at the Director's Guild squirm in their seats and hide their eyes so be warned  it isn't pretty.",Hard Candy
295,agitpop,"Deadly candy, important film",9,6 July 2013,"The story is masterfully acted and told, the plot takes several unexpected turns. In the beginning I couldn't help myself but sympathize with the male character (well: I'm male and I'm also working as a photographer), but as the story unfolded my sympathy changed into disgust.The first half of the film reminded me of Michael Haneke's ""Funny Games"". There is a castration-scene that is a gruesome piece of cinema. Even though there's nothing particularly gory visible, it's audible. Just as with Haneke's Funny Games it's therefore extremely painful to watch - because the worst images happen in your head.The second half of the film is more like a psychological thriller that peaks and concludes with the confession of the child-murderer and his suicide.The last images show Hayley in a dress that reminds of ""Little Red Riding Hood"" an image that is probably meant to underline her 'innocence'.///""Hard Candy"" is a very important film.First it's one of the few films that deal with the subject of pedophilia and violence against women.It is interesting (even though slightly unrealistic) to see such a strong independent female character. Other films with strong female characters that come to my mind are: Kill Bill or Kick-Ass, but these are in one way or the other comical films. Hard Candy on the other side is dealing with a dead serious subject, but it's not realistic even though it looks more realistic from the onset. Does it need to be realistic? Not at all: it's a film.It's the strongest and deadliest and smartest female character I've yet seen, the character of Hayley acts completely self-sufficiently and without any influence of a male character.What I can not completely agree with are the moral implications of Hard Candy, for example the self-justice and that awkward mentioning of Roman Polanski (what do the film-makers imply by that? That Polanski should be castrated and killed?).The film is also full of many clichées, for example by making the male character a photographer. As mentioned I'm a photographer myself, I feel slightly uncomfortable when I hear that voyeurism in general is considered castration-worthy. Every photographer is a ""voyeur"" in one way or the other.It is also awkward for me - as a man - to find the main actor running around after a DIY-castration without showing any sign of pain. I'd guess that this is completely unrealistic. In reality that man would have probably puked through the whole second part of the film from the resulting pain.Conclusion: If it was a film about a different subject I'd probably give it 5 or 6 points out of 10. The reason why I'm giving 9/10 points is because I think it's a very important film: it's dealing with a very serious subject and depicts a female character as strong as I've never seen it before. It would be great to see more characters like this.",Hard Candy
296,Breitschleif,An interesting story with a lot of suspense that somehow gets lost towards the second half of the movie.,7,7 July 2014,"I quite enjoyed this film, Ellen Page's acting as the sweet yet obviously highly disturbed girl who is ""on the hunt"" was brilliant and that alone makes this movie worth watching.The plot was intriguing and offered a lot of suspense, it's a pity that it did not show more of the back story/real motives that drive the female protagonist though. The character Hayley remains a mystery which did not come across as ""interesting"", it rather felt as if the movie was lacking a certain depth and this is the main reason why I would not rate it more than ""good"" overall.The violence takes an in my opinion unnecessarily big part of the play time and makes the film come across as a bit too shallow towards the end. It also seemed highly unrealistic how after all that was done to him the victim still seems to be ""actually pretty fine"" physically, this was weird to watch at some points.In conclusion the movie is worth the watch but missed the chance to be amazing by including more in-depth psychological portrayal of its main characters instead of the excessive violence scenes.7/10, i was tending towards 6/10 but it barely made the cut.",Hard Candy
297,travis-j-rodgers,Nothing to see here?,6,28 September 2006,"I read the comments on the DVD case for ""Hard Candy"", and, as a result, expected to see a very compelling, gritty film that would push my buttons. The film was none of these things, but let me talk about the good before I get ahead of myself.The opening scene was very well done. We were quickly thrust into the film as an audience, seeing private things, which is a clear theme of the film: what happens when people get to see your private ""stuff""? can people ever see your private stuff? The subsequent scene, in the cafe, was similarly well executed. Hayley was an intriguing character, while Jeff was every bit as creepy as he ought to be. Jeff was believable as a suffering character, psychologically tormented. The camera work was interesting, the scenery, though limited, was interesting as well. Technically, the film was good.From the time the two of them went back to Jeff's house, things went downhill quickly. There is no reasonable reason to believe the things coming out of Hayley's mouth. There is no reason to feel any sympathy for either character. There is simply no reason to watch this film but to say that you managed to watch it through to the end. There are no disturbing spectacles, there is no witty dialogue, there is only one uncomfortable scene. As a result, I felt cheated on two levels: my buttons were not pushed, as the DVD seemingly promised, and the film was unimpressive in almost all aspects, which is a disappointment for most films.I rate the film a 6/10, as it is like so many other films out there: aspiring to the stars, not managing to make it more than a few feet off of the ground. Technical quality was surprisingly good for what seems to have been a low budget film.",Hard Candy

I found myself sympathising with Jeff's character, yes the paedophile. I can understand that the whole idea was that he has this likable facade of a nice man, but you slowly realise that underneath it he is a paedophile and murdered. I think that the reason i liked him was simply how much i hated Hayley, or should i say Ellen Page as Hayley, because i believe that had someone else been cast then my feelings may have been different. Her constant whiny voice scratching my delicate ears was what sealed the deal. I think that the film was watchable, worth watching simply to feed by curiosity as i had herd about it. But believe me it was nothing special. With it's storyline i believe it could've been something more, but in this case it has been wasted I'm afraid.",Hard Candy
299,kkkkoooollll,"Great movie, with a politically correct ending",8,3 October 2006,"I think the alternative ending, where the girl ends up hanging from the roof would be better. Otherwise it gets too predictable in the last 20 minutes of the movie. In the alternative ending his arriving long lost girlfriend was the one who did the old ritual killing of the missing teenager, and the Hayley girl was the actual sexual perpetrator. Too bad they have chosen the politically correct ending over this alternative one. Albeit, more graphic. As to the positive sides of the movie, I really loved the soundtrack, the lost voices of long forgotten punk rock bands revive the background pictures. In addition, I would really like to commend the cameramen on their incredibly meticulous work. All the colors, the shapes, and the movements come in front of the viewer really live and happening.",Hard Candy
300,hermione47,Paedophiles and Lolita,1,6 June 2006,"I was very disappointed by this film, especially since the beginning was so promising. Attractive 30 something photographer meets 14 year old girl through chat-room. She turns out to be a kind of avenger for all pedophiles victims and ends up by castrating him and pushing him to hang himself. It's a good idea to have the alleged pedophile played by a young attractive actor but that's about it. Things I found annoying: the girl was so infuriating that I would have liked to see her choke on one of her many wisecracks (like Grace Kelly in Dial M for Murder or Gwyneth Paltrow in just about any film, they are righteous and beautiful, but boy you just wanna squash them like flies). Why do you have to spoil what could be a thought provoking film with irony and smart-ass film references? I do not condone child molestation but I am very very suspicious of teenage girls from Lolita onwards (I am a woman in case you're wondering): violence is always wrong, but is it always violence? What about statutory rape? Isn't this some kind of a legal oxymoron? Ultimately, I would have appreciated a little more exploration of the grey areas that surround the concept of child sexuality and of the boundaries attached to the idea of ""self-service"" justice. I think a little less petulance and sarcasm and a little more empathy and silence would have helped... And, by the way, the cinematography was excellent, but so what? Any MTV director worth his salt could do the same or better. Conclusion: a missed opportunity.",Hard Candy
301,SCUM-Auxiliary,"An effective, amoral variation on the classic horror film...",10,2 May 2006,"Though most horror films, specifically those easily classified into this sometimes limiting genre, deal with a ""monster"" and ""victim"" (or, to be less simplistically specific, ""predator"" and ""prey""), but rarely are these roles so effectively amorphis, and in such a way that allows the film to retain these antithetical distinctions between characters and the archetypes they subsequently come to embody. ******Spoilers******On this psychological battlefield, the ""monster,"" in traditional fashion, is seemingly invincible, implacable and difficult, if not impossible, to elude. She is a 14 year old girl, endowed with the intellect and patience of an adult, but driven by the fantastical idealism, the unchecked passion and, most importantly (if it is to be interpreted as a horror film), the giddy sadism of a child. This ""monster"" is deaf to the pleas of her ""victim,"" who occupies this status because of his perceived (and, at this point, former) role as ""monster,"" in the form of a sex offender and probable murderer. While ""Haley"" (her name a fabrication like all other information Jeff has come to know about her, thus adding to her terrifying mystique. All he is able to know definitively is the pain she inflicts and the end she has devised for him) lacks the physical prowess of her male counterpart (equivalent?), she must compensate with cunning, the almost supernatural like of which Jeff could never have imagined, and it is this fatal assumption that proves his tragic flaw, akin to the unexpected detour taken by a car-load of impending corpses in standard horror fare. Yes, she has a ""reason"" for what she does, but does not even the most savage serial killer have some arbitrary justification to which s/he might lay claim? In this case, her reasons lie only in hearsay and inference, like those of the paranoiac confusing all women with his abusive mother, and the director only serves to increase the horror of Jeff's plight.Is Jeff a rapist and murderer guilty of preying on innocence? Obviously. From a standpoint of pure judicial evaluation, there is ""justice,"" but as this is a horror film, concerned not with form but on content, we are presented with an unrelenting reversal of the torture killing we've come to expect from Jeff's character, with no visceral depiction of the latter's guilt to check and balance the onslaught. We never SEE him harm anyone (save through minor acts of dubious self-defense long after he has endured the gauntlet), but we are offered no respite from the methodical destruction of HIS life, on every level (including the destruction of his bond with the one person for whom he has human feelings). Never is he allowed to inflict the agony to which we've seen him subjected on this near-mythic avenger of children (who, like most horror-movie killers, has lost moral high-ground in her descent to the level of the abuser), and he is denied redemption as well as reprieve, in the uncompromising fashion more becoming a snuff film than a psychological revenge treatise. In the end, we are not left with a balanced conflict, but rather an appropriately one-sided display of weakness taunted, battered and ultimately destroyed at the hands of the strong, who killed out of pleasure.",Hard Candy

303,blissey_s,Ellen Saved This,7,11 August 2021,"Ellen Page really saved this from being a complete flop. She was convincing as hell and given that she was so young here it's even more impressive. Her conviction and intensity really translated through the screen. The castration scene was tough to get through, not only because it was wince inducing but because it went on for way too long. I felt they were milking that scene for all it was worth, which wasn't that much. I found the script really quite well done - a lot of Hayley's lines were burns that landed with impact. I didn't predict the story at all. When Hayley turned the tables and drugged Jeff I was really caught off guard. Wasn't expecting that at all. I kind of wish Sandra Oh played a bigger part in this movie - it would have been way more entertaining if she found out that Jeff was being held captive. Instead it kind of felt like she was an unnecessary addition. Also, I found the endless interrogation by Hayley a bit drawn out and excessive. I mean, the entire movie is basically Hayley driving the proverbial knife in deeper and deeper trying to prove a point that could have been made much sooner. I think this movie suffers from overall lack of variety in style and scenes as it takes place entirely in a home with two characters. Ellen Page's performance here makes that not such a bad thing, but if you dislike either of the two main actors then you'll surely hate this.",Hard Candy

306,marian-g,Do Not Fracture Your Teeth On Hard Candy,7,10 December 2006,"A friend of mine alerted me on this psychological thriller. Reading previous reviews didn't exactly give me an idea of what I can expect.Firstly, the story develops around interaction of two actors at most time mainly in one interior. Perception of how well was executed this part determines the success with a viewer. I find acting of the actors both credible and real-like rending thus discussion of who was in control obsolete.Having said that I reckon the camera work could have been different meaning more creative. Except for the brief ""fast-forwarded"", dynamic scene in which the girl goes through the photographer's drawers in search of an incriminating stuff, one gets impression of a low budget TV documentary. But perhaps this, too, contributes to the grittiness of this urban study of guilt, innocence and mind-games thereon. The story is surely designed to provoke thoughts on maturity of adolescents and setting up the boundaries.Living in the West, my opinion would be (and it is also a good advice for all the potential paedophiles) that one must respect cultural stereotype which is righteously here to protect vulnerable. If you'd like to photograph summery dressed teenager, ask parents for permission first. It is OK to exchange thoughts via email but why would an adult have needed more intimate involvement? Therefore the man and his behaviour in the movie reek of sickness in one way or another.You see, anytime you play with a devil expecting a fair play from it, sooner or later you are bound to fracture your teeth on Hard Candy.",Hard Candy
307,David-352,Unforgettable,8,18 February 2007,"I'm always interested to see what people say about films that have engaged or interested me. This one is a prime example. Comments seem heavily weighted to either Loved It or Hated It, and it's fascinating to see how really divergent peoples' perceptions are. I very much liked this film, though I don't like violence in general, or vengeance in general, both of which are important thematic elements in this movie. The two protagonists in the film are both psychopaths -- in a ""normal"" frame of reference. But that doesn't keep them from being human beings, that is, something completely other than their pathologies. The film makers have tried to illuminate these human dimensions, and I think they have been partly, maybe sufficiently, successful. Many of the contributors to this forum who have hated this movie seem to think the movie takes sides -- either presents Jeff or Hayley as too sympathetic, depending on the contributor's own feelings about the behaviors of each. The truth lies exactly between, in my opinion: The movie carefully takes no side at all, but instead shows these two exactly as they are, leaving the viewer a few subtle clues as to why they behave as they do. Nothing is justified, there is no pretense to righteousness or even decency on either side. I have great respect for these film makers -- I don't see exploitation here.

Patrick Wilson is appropriately creepy as Jeff, the unassuming guy next door who looks like he wouldn't harm a fly. Ellen Page is the one who truly carries the film as Haley, the smart calculating mastermind who attempts to expose Jeff for what he really is. I have seen this movie like a hundred times, and it is still thrilling and exciting even though i know what happens.

310,TonesH,Chilling and Depraved,6,14 June 2006,"In an interesting twist on the Little Red Riding Hood tale, David Slade brings us a fantastically twisted piece that shows that thrillers are most effective at their most simple, and least gory.Hard Candy is the story of a seemingly innocent 14 year old girl who is taken home by a very suspect 30-something, for reasons that seem not entirely honourable at the start. The mood quickly changes from a curiously funny and slantedly ""romantic"" beginning to a suspenseful and depraved story of a girl who is threatening a man with castration for his sick interest in under-aged children, and his possible involvement with the murder of another young girl.The first thing that impresses upon an audience is the talent of the actors. Almost the entirety of the film is the interaction between Haley and Jeff. Ellen Page gives an absolutely incredible performance, and made her character into one of the most complex and fascinating villains in cinema, up there with Kevin Spacy as Kaiser Sose, and Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lector. She is an amoral anti-hero with a cutting wit, a sly sense of humour, and is powerful beyond her physical attributes. Jeff Kohlver brings a great gravity to his character. Though we are aware from the start that he takes a sick interest in young children, and even when he is all but outed as a paedophile, one still feels that what he undergoes in the film is undeserved.But the atmosphere of suspense is what makes this movie as brilliant as it is. The film is almost entirely set in Jeff's house, and Jeff spends most of the film tied up, in discussion with Hayley. The threat of carstration provides the perfect terror. It is something that is utterly horrible, but not something that is so unbelievable beyond our possible experience, that the audience is allowed to relate to it in a way that the almost silly premise of films like Texas Chainsaw Massacre denies from us. Here is a strange situation, but one that is entirely possible, and one that we can relate to. But, as a sign of the excellence of the direction, the ""action"" scenes never break this mood. They are believable, and yet dramatic. Jeff's attempts to get back at Hayley are excellently conceived, and Hayley's ability to keep Jeff in check, physically at first, and mentally in the end, were perfectly executed.This is really the movie that does what thrillers should be trying to do. Unlike Hostel, which I considered to have a similar intention in mind, it works without pretension, without resorting to senseless violence, and without pandering to the lowest common denomenator of audiences. By being clever, both in the concept and the dialogue, it makes it a film that can be enjoyed on many levels, and therefore a fantastic movie for all audiences. It is truly the best film of the suspense genre that I have ever seen. I look forward to seeing the future work of the actors and the directors.",Hard Candy
311,JustineAssad,Not bad. Expected more,6,24 April 2015,"Haley, a fourteen-year old girl meets a man in his thirties, Jeff (Patrick Wilson), in an online chat room. She suggests that they meet in person and he happily agrees. After a coffee she goes home with him where she drugs him and ties him up; convinced he is a murderous paedophile, she goes about torturing him until he confesses.The thing is: it was very hard for me to feel sympathy for Page's character because I simply disliked her; whether it was intentional or not on the filmmaker's side not to divulge her background doesn't detract from the fact that it was hard to form any sort of ""allegiance"" with her. She was just a little too off-kilter, just a little too unstable to actually like, or know in any way whatsoever if her actions were justified. Whether she was a victim herself, or a friend of the victim or what: you simply had no way of knowing.What the film did manage to do was to create sympathy for Wilson; and yes, it may be creepy to admit as he's clearly not exactly innocent (what's he doing flirting with fourteen-year olds?), but as humans we're sorta automatically distressed at watching another human suffer, especially when – at first – he's coming across as innocent, and the one doing all the harm is definitely not playing with a full deck of cards, and I can't help but say it, fracking annoying to boot. So as twisted as it may sound, for most of the movie I was sorta kinda rooting for him...And then there are the issues with logic that sorta irritated me: how on earth did a tiny little fourteen year old girl manage to haul and pick up a fully-grown, adult male? I mean: she got him standing up on a chair and all nicely tied and hoisted while he was unconscious. How on earth...? Anyway, before I run away with myself: it was a decent premise overall, and well-acted despite me not really liking Page. And while it's being touted as a ""thriller"" or ""horror,"" no... not really. This was more drama, more psychological thriller at a push; it didn't have me on the edge of my seat and once it got to the halfway mark I sorta stopped expecting that it would get me there. There was more talk than action, which I'm not saying is a bad thing, but at the end of the day if you're looking for a thrilling ride: this isn't the movie for you; if you're looking for something intriguing, something different, then give it a go.",Hard Candy

313,JodyBruchon,Great premise with tons of potential rots into dumb vigilante justice porn,1,8 May 2017,"This film had everything set up to make for a glorious mind-screwing psychological movie that tests boundaries and covers highly controversial topics. A teenage girl intentionally seeks out a guy she thinks may be a pedophile? That's not something you tend to see in movies and such a concept alone inspires hordes of people to grab their pitchforks in a knee-jerk moralistic gut reaction. You couldn't have asked for a better platform on which to build a deep psychological movie.It's so unfortunate that such a great premise slowly rotted away into what can only be described as ""vigilante justice porn."" Yes, it's full of shocking high-tension moments, but they aren't because of the interesting story or the uncomfortable questions running through your mind. It's uncomfortable for the same reason that The Passion of the Christ was uncomfortable: you get to spend an entire movie wondering how much farther the brutality of it all can go.On a technical note, this movie makes far too much use of very high shutter speeds on the cameras resulting in a complete lack of motion blur during tense action moments; the intent is to make you uncomfortable through unnatural-looking movement but the actual result is just plain annoying.I was disappointed when I realized that the movie was not going anywhere with the initial premise and had no intentions of being interesting, cerebral, novel, or anything other than mindless vitriol. I can't understand people who gave it high ratings; did we watch the same movie? The only thing this succeeds at is getting you past the setup at the start; everything else looks like a typical big-budget movie but has almost zero plot. The real point of this movie seems to be to mess with you and make you uncomfortable, neither of which are okay if there's no payoff afterwards. It is not smart, it is not deep, and it is not interesting.

I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was, but felt my stomach was churning throughout most of the movie. Ellen Page was fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. You'd have to look to Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter to find a comparable performance.This movie sets your nerves on edge and keeps them there. At the beginning, you worry about Hayley, assuming that she might fall prey to a pedophile. However, 20 to 30 minutes in, and you sympathize with the man, thinking that he's been trapped by a criminally insane young woman. Then the movie keeps you guessing, is he the victim, or is he a perpetrator getting his comeuppance? The movie goes back and forth several times, and it's only the very end that we learn the truth.Even then, the ending doesn't offer much comfort. Most people will be happy to see a pedophile buy the farm, but it is much less reassuring when you realize that the punisher is a brilliant sociopath who might not always be 'right'.Ellen Page (Hayley) deserved way more attention for her performance in this movie.But, like I said, expect to leave the theater feeling somewhat queasy.",Hard Candy
315,yoshi_indo,Best psychological thriller I have ever seen.,9,21 April 2011,"I had no idea what to expect of this movie, but what I got out of it was a feeling of despair and desolation only a talented crew can evoke. The Plot : A photographer (Patrick Wilson) decides to meet up with an online friend (Ellen Page). During their encounter she suspects him of being a pedophile and proceeds to confirm her theory.The Writing: This (in my opinion) is the strongest point of the movie. It is fresh original and left me speechless, and in shock with its chilling conclusion. Most of the stark and bleak emotions created by this movie is conveyed through the script. There was only one scene that involved silly writing but it can be justified with due to the emotions of the empire ( it involves a character being able to gain something but does not take it). The movie revolves around Patrick Wilson and Ellen Paige, and only deviates from these two for less than ten minutes of screen time (mostly to a side character played by Sandra Oh). I cannot talk anymore about the script lest I give anything of value the script has to offer , but in the end I believe it is masterfully written and executed.The Acting: Patrick Wilson and Ellen Paige take over 95% of the screen time and everything they give is pure gold. Wilson is able to believably pull off the seemingly innocent man with flashes of suspicious cunning. However I thought Paige was the star of the show, being able to convey the eccentricities of her character without eating scenery. Her characters antics do become unnatural at times, but only adds to the emotions created by the movie. The Cinematography: I have never seen a movie use halogen lights and simplistic settings create such a feeling of desolation.The set itself is mostly composed of rooms with primary colours,and I thought these cleverly symbolized the emotions going through the characters in said rooms. The lighting is brilliant giving the movie a cold, and deathly atmosphere. The movie has some gore in it,but it is only used to support the hopelessness conveyed by the writing. The bleak atmosphere is also emphasized by the close up shots of the main characters and how they react to each other, and each other only. David Slade did an amazing job, and only a movie like this would have allowed me to forgive his sub-par performance in Twilight. The Score: There is no background music in this movie, however there are some ambient noises that add to the tension and suspense the movie has to offer. This was very effective at once again bringing forth emotions of hopelessness and forlorn. Criticisms: I would have liked it if the movie spent more time developing the characters a bit more. However I understand it would have taken away a lot of the mystery this movie had to offer. And one knows a sign of a good movie is when one is left wanting more.This movie is a must see. It does contain a lot of mature content and disturbing scenes so it is DEFINITELY not for children. Go rent this movie now!9.5/10",Hard Candy
316,vlad-cocoru,Aberrant,2,20 September 2006,"I'll surely warn everyone I know this is a must-NOT-see movie...I think this is the first time I took other users' comments for granted and I was SO WRONG! I should have guessed this... come on, the movie only has 5 characters, three of them acting for at most 10 minutes (together). No doubt, a psychological drama, but so awfully played! Our guy gets tied up (STANDING) by a 14 years old 'mature' prick, decided to take revenge in the name of all girls she imagines Geoff has molested. One of the main scenes are about a surgery that isn't happening, the guy screams his lungs out on the floor while the girl is just painting him with some reddish mix. I could say the only thing deserving to be mentioned about this - name it whatever but NOT a decent movie - is the attention the director payed for details. Only 2-3 goofs, but minor ones. I might have not got the idea, nor motivation of the characters (anyway, the movie lets us decide whatever moved them to their actions), but I deeply think this is because IT HAD NO STARTING POINT, we just had to see one's (sick) fantasy about this case.Listen to me, if you want to pay even $3 for this, you'd better buy some flowers/candies or even donate the money... it simply isn't worth seeing it. Trust me. Or trust those voting 1 for this movie. There are always persons voting just to lower a movie's ranking, but these votes were actually the real ones. Check for other users' comments, which say this movie is a total CRAP ! I've seen many movies, and had my share of not so well done ones. The problem usually was because awful special effects, plenty goofs or simply not well done. But this is not the last case. This seems to be done especially to be something with a negative impact over the crowd. But without making a point. It's so unlikely that story would take place somewhere, and so cartoon-like actions, a teenage with serious mental problems, good at everything, decides to learn our guy a lesson... The end is an open one, but so open I think it would have been the same if the movie ended half an hour earlier. To summarize, i'd cut a part from the movie's MPAA description: 'disturbing violent and aberrant'.",Hard Candy
317,novella221,A lot worse than I expected,3,15 September 2006,"I was so eager to watch this film and now after watching it I feel very disappointed to say the least. Firstly the characters are so unconvincing, unnatural and both their voices really did my head in, but I suppose that's a personal opinion. Hayley is an annoying, cocky 14 year old. She has so much front it's just so annoyingly unbelievable. The film is slow, and slightly unclear. I believe this film could have been so much better. I don't understand why some areas were avoided. I understand it's involving a very sensitive subject but if this is what the film is all about at least give it a bit more dialogue. I was confused because it took me a while to realise that this guy was really a paedophile. Obviously we don't need to see things on screen however why couldn't it be that Hayley found inappropriate pictures etc., it would have given the film a bit more to work with. The cheesy lines at the beginning didn't sound right, they sounded so unnatural and the actors might as well have been reading straight from their scripts.The 'castration' scene was effective in a punishment sense for a paedophile, however how many 14 year olds do you know could have done such a medical procedure? Yeh maybe it is possible with excess research but it was stupid and once again unbelievable. Her constant concern when carrying it out was a bit odd. This girl was mad but she seemed to have some sanity in there somewhere.Both characters could have been written better. It's always annoying to see some kid manage to do such great things, like drugging a grown man, then managing to pick him up and tie him in a chair and getting him to stand on a chair while she wraps rope round his neck ready to be hanged, and convincing him to jump off a roof and hang himself. Lets face it he could have easily just chucked her off the roof for being an annoying beatch and done us all a favour. Naturally you shouldn't feel sorry for Jeff but his character on screen doesn't really make you hate him except you know he's a paedophile and at the end realise he had some involvement in some girls murder. More than anything throughout this film I wanted Hyley to get her comeuppance. She was annoying and obnoxious and lets face it she was dangerous and belonged in a mental home herself.The film failed to highlight the problem of paedophilia, which could have been done effectively but also tactfully. The film doesn't make you feel complete hatred towards Jeff even though what he is. It's just not made clear at all.This film is rather poor, It's watchable but is slightly boring to begin with. The characters are just not convincing. This film could have been so much better, perhaps more actors were needed instead of just 2 with annoying voices.",Hard Candy
318,Black-Jack-Shellac,"Disturbing, but in a good way",9,7 November 2006,"This is an excellent film. The delivery of the story is fraught with suspense, even before the most disturbing scenes begin. As with other rape revenge fantasies like the 1978 film ""I spit on your grave"", you may find yourself somewhat conflicted over the behaviour of the victim. It is not clear though in this film whether the 14 year old female antagonist, played remarkably by the 19 year old Canadian actress Ellen Page, is herself a victim or a vigilante. The viciousness of her revenge, both physically and psychologically may lead you to sympathise with the alleged paedophile, but by the end of the film all becomes clear. Most men will find it very hard to not sympathize with the helplessness of the paedophile, at least up to the point when it becomes clear that he really is a paedophile, given the impromptu medical treatment he receives. Keep your legs crossed.",Hard Candy
319,gerardo_guzman,What a suspense!,10,7 October 2006,"I saw the movie for the first time last night while flying from Boston to Austin TX. I had the movie not really knowing what it was all about. I postpone to see this movie because I thought it was another horror movie attempt, but I was so bored through-out the flight that I decided to watch. The movie is quite an experience. At first, I was feeling sorry for the guy but then, I was glad for what was happening to him. The movie took many of my emotions and ran with them in many directions because the thriller takes you that way.The acting is great, and this little girl is going to be huge on day. I was very pleased with the plot and the story and how it develops. I like this movie and I wish that all perverts out there get a chance to see it and see what it may come their way.",Hard Candy
320,jnunes-1,Swimming With Sharks of pedophilia,8,14 October 2006,"since there are dozens of glowing reviews here covering the story and great acting jobs, let me offer some criticisms while saying I enjoyed the film. 1) Hayley is far too mature for her age, at least as she gives her age in the film (14).She's completely analytical and plans every step without allowing emotion to cloud her judgment. Maybe she could have been portrayed as being a little older, or as posing as younger than she is, but it's not at all believable to me that this girl is 14. 2) There are too many reversals where Jeff is tied up, gets loose and then is recaptured by Hayley. This is one of the few ways for the story to have action after the pedophile character Jeff is bound, but once would have been enough for me. It might have been more interesting if Jeff had regained the upper hand at some point and then lost it, but he never does. This film is interesting as it plays on our sympathies, slowly revealing more and more about the characters. We hope for Jeff to escape until we realize the depths of his character and past actions. The revenge plot really reminded me of two films - Swimming with Sharks and Audition. If you haven't seen Audition, check it out as long as you're prepared for the shockingly overdone horror elements; otherwise it's a fascinating art film about a girl taking revenge on a man.",Hard Candy

322,DVLefferts,Hard Candy asks a lot of important questions...,7,1 October 2006,"...But does it answer them? I'll assume everyone already knows the basic storyline. A girl who seems interested in an older man she met on the Internet transforms into some kind of lunatic bent on revenge against pedophiles. Indeed, the girl is a lunatic, and she is terrible. There are long, drawn-out sequences of torture both physical and emotional. I'll throw the word out there, ""castration."" Some of these scenes are the most disturbing in film I have come across in years. But, here's the first question Hard Candy asks: how terrible can you really be to a pedophile? But then again, another: what defines a pedophile? As we come to learn, Jeff is lonely, and appreciative of young, pure beauty. Hard Candy offers the answer to pedophilia that Nabokov uses in Lolita: Jeff was once in love when he was Hayley's age. His life is built on a constant chase to find that young love again, even as he persists to grow older and older. Are there some legitimate excuses for pedophilia? Is it wrong for people to try and understand it? How much of our lives is based on sexual pursuit? And is seemingly sexual pursuit always, on its deepest level, just simply sexual? Does educating young teenagers about the dangers of sex with strangers and Internet stalking necessarily help them, or does it ruin their innocence just as severely as that which it is used against? And finally, how mean can people truly be to each other? These are the questions Hard Candy asks, but unfortunately, the movie drags out the thriller aspect and turns itself into too much disturbing ""fun"" to serve as any kind of allegorical answer.",Hard Candy
323,pmaheadquarters,Never wanted to see someone get throttled so bad in my life,1,6 May 2017,"Well what can you say about a movie that relishes in a sick little psycho bitch torturing a man for just about the duration of the movie. Add to the fact that she had no actual proof that he'd done anything wrong but I guess her being psychic allowed to piece everything together. She was an ""honour student"" after all and in case you didn't hear her the first time she repeats it multiple times, as if this makes things seem more credible. NOT! We are led to believe a scrawny (she actually looked like a boy so I don't possibly see what the attraction would be) little 14 year old brat was able to pick up an adult male and move him around into various positions such as a chair and on a table in order to torture him. Nice insult to the viewers intelligence and for me the movie immediately became a joke because of it.The long drawn out castration scene was gratuitous and disgusting. Whatever message (if any) this movie attempted to convey failed miserably as if anything like many other reviewers I totally sympathized with the supposed ""predator"" infinitely more than this insufferable psycho talk box. I think it's safe to say that when this happens and the ""heroine"" is so hateful in relation to the supposed bad guy the movie is an ultimate failure.In fact, as others have said her character was so infuriating and unsympathetic that I craved for Jeff to break free and smash her skull in and was truly disappointed when it didn't happen.Vile piece of unbelievable trash. If your idea of entertainment is to watch a man being tortured in the most sadistic way possible go for it. I personally found it infuriating and which I'd have never seen it.",Hard Candy
324,jrosenf1,Difficult subject that needs to be addressed on film,6,1 August 2006,"This disturbing little indie has generated so many opinions on both sides of the fence. Many praise it for the psychological tension and gritty realism; others condemn it for its spotty dialog, padded runtime, and implausible scenarios.Not to be a fence-sitter, but both camps have solid points. The interaction between the two leads, Jeff, a pedophile photographer (Wilson), and Hayley, a savvy, vengeance-minded 14-year-old girl(Page) is hypnotizing. From the opening shot of their chat room hook-up, through their first meeting, to the hunted turning the tables on the hunter, the performances of these two actors had me glued to the screen. The innocent-looking but not-so-innocent Hayley stole the show as we watch her transform from naive victim to bloodthirsty vigilante right before our unbelieving eyes. And Wilson more than held his own by making his despicable character sympathetic thanks to his emotional portrayal. Both should be a force in this business for years to come.Unfortunately, things went south quickly. Could Haylee have drugged Jeff and tied him up so tightly that he couldn't move? Possibly. Could she have subdued him numerous times thereafter, and forced him to choose his eventual fate? Doubtful. In parts the script seemed to get real thin, like the director had run out of story, so he just added some pointless dialog and side stories. And Jeff's aforementioned fate and the questionable ending of the film really brought it down another notch.But my point is that at least those involved took the chance on this difficult subject and hopefully shed some light on a problem that is plaguing our society today- internet predators. This film made me think and want to take action against these people, just not the kind of action Hayley took. The actors did what they could with the script, and if the director had cut the film down to a lean 80 or so minutes, the message could've been a lot more potent. But I think they accomplished what they set out to do, and that was to make a thought- provoking film that would make more people aware of this troubling issue, and hopefully help other underage kids from making similar mistakes.",Hard Candy

She pretty much pretended to castrate him and they did it in a way that the viewers would think so too. The entire thing was disturbing and still disturbing to this day even though we come to realize she was just playing a sadistic game with him. I agree with all of the one star reviews here. There is zero plot or motive revealed unless you want to call it a revenge story...even if you're one to call it that, no one knows who this girl is and why she wants revenge and why she is so disappointed when she can't find kiddie porn and how she or anyone would even come up with the idea of being 14 yrs old and interested enough in biology that you just suddenly become qualified enough to scare someone into thinking you're actually castrating them to get them to confess to something they didn't do... then it not working at all.

328,ragboypizza,Warning: this movie is SO BAD!!!,1,4 October 2006,"Here's fair warning for you: this movie is nothing but hype. It's just another limp Sundance wannabe, with absolutely no b#lls (so to speak) that wimps out on itself for 1.5 hours.And, boy oh boy, is this movie ever padded to make it to 90 minutes. It's a 10-minute short stretched beyond belief by way of talk, talk, talk and then some more talk, talk, talk, like really bad one-liners, lame plays on words, characters speaking obvious things like it's some kind of debate on sexual matters that it's actually afraid to talk about.It's a PG-rated afterschool special posing as an R-rated ""edgy"" ""indie"" masterpiece.You'll find no gore or anything at all shocking in this movie, so don't bother torturing yourself is that's what you're expecting.To make matters even more annoying, this movie screams of first-time filmmaker. Maybe it's not a first, I don't really care, but I really hope it's a LAST! Even worse, again, it screams of amateur filmmaker who grew up watching MTV and thinking all that shaking camera and desaturated color is, like, sooo coool dude! On that note, why is the camera shaking all the time, like there's an earthquake? Is it to make up for how dull and lifeless and saggy this thing really is? And why is everything shot like Saving Private Ryan with the fast shutter? Again, to make up for the flaccid goings on.Here's hoping that Ellen Page doesn't get stuck in crap like this anymore. She's way too good for it. Check out Marion Bridge, or even Trailer Park Boys to see for yourself.This one will be forgotten in six months, when the hype finally goes limp. If you must see it, wait until it's a dollar-rental and be prepared to fast-forward through the countless stupid moving shots of red walls.Sundance has really turned filmmakers' minds to mush.

330,icechalkhands,Almost but not quite(well maybe),10,10 May 2006,"Alright, I'd first like to start by letting those who might gaze upon my review know that I was actually stoked about seeing this movie. So much so, that I even denounced X-Men 3 and Silent Hill. This was(was being the operative word their) the first movie that I had been excited about seeing in I don't know how long. The trailer for the movie was ingenious, I mean it didn't give to much away and it seemed like a new idea had been spawned in the movie genre. That being said, this movie was nowhere near as good as I thought it was going to be. I'm not saying I didn't like it, I'm just saying it's pretty bad when the trailers for other movies(the opening trailers) were more exciting then the actual movie itself. I can actually remember saying to myself at one point(while watching Hard Candy)""Damn, that ""BRICK"" movie looks like it will be kick ass"". Not to say that the movie is dull, but it is pretty slow at times and certain scenes shouldn't have even been in the movie. For instance, the scenes with Sandra Oh were so pointless. Outside the ""supposed"" suspense scene were Haily and Oh's(see I don't even remember if she had a name) charter exchange kiwi like lines towards one another; their was completely no use for Oh's charter. This is proved by the vast disappearance of Oh's charter right after her quick introduction.PERFORMANCES: OK, after seeing Hard Candy for myself, I can officially say that I'm sick of hearing people talk about Ellen Pages performance as though it was ""Genuine"". I'm sorry but my definition of a ""Genuine"" performance is a performance that you can't imagine any other actor or actress pulling off other then the original. Like Malcolm McDowell in A Clockwork Orange for example. I could have thought of at least ten actresses in the biz who could have pulled off Haily on a bad day. Not to take anything away from Ellen Page's performance(I really wanted her to overwhelm me with her performance), she was awesome and I can see this particular performance getting her some form of media fame, so more power to her. I'm pretty sure that cutting off a mans' balls will at least land her five or six more film after this one, or at best will make her an idol god amongst feminist protesters. I won't go to much into Patrick Wilson's performance solely because I thought he did a great job(but I could think other actors who could fill his shoes as well, like Sameul L Jackson,LOL, yeah right).Your probably wondering why I gave the movie a solid 10 when it seems like I'm bashing it harder then the Nebraska prom queen. This is because despite the flaws(the flaws I saw) of the movie, I still(on some level) think that it's worthy of a 10. If not for the performance, then maybe for the fact that the movie was bold enough to be made in the first place.Overall the movie is good for seeing it a least once and it's also even worthy of a DVD sell(I'm f ucking buying it), but it does not deserve all the hype that it's getting.P.S.

333,trickstar_trippy,"What's this, Little Red Riding Hood",2,27 July 2006,"Adults only? Actually, only half of the two-actor cast consisted of adults, the other being reserved to the little kids. Given that Macaulay Culkin wasn't available, they hired 19-year old Ellen Page to play the 'little vindicative bitch'. I've been reading reviews praising her acting, her charisma, and class and I've been disappointed: I thought acting means more than mere memorizing lines and uttering them in a flat voice. As for her impersonating poetic justice, give me a break: the story is more unbelievable than Miike's Audition or than any other fairy tale I must've read during my childhood (including Lynch's own). She is no more than a spoiled little brat, that needed some good spanking and no dessert. I know this kind of old-school-charge-and-beat-everything-that-moves preaching won't get me any standing ovations, but it's hard to keep unbiased when you see a lousy act like that. And it's not everything about the girl: this film with its minimalistic approach bored me more than Clerks combined with Linklater's Tape, and this should say something. Some might argue the film had some melodrama stirred in for good measure, but, alas, the film didn't work as a tear-jerker either. Not all directors have what it takes to make another 'Cement Garden' or 'Happiness'. I could say the film had no balls, weren't it for the lousy act of male humiliation. One more thing: I saw mentioned the label 'disturbing' applied to this film. Hell, no: the only thing truly disturbing in this film was that poor little girl trying to act like a cold-blooded killer.

Viewers will disagree about this for years to come, I am sure.This intimate duel of wits and willpower raises a host of questions. What separates good from evil?

It's a blurred line of whether or not the man is a pedophile or not but none the less, he has no business chatting with a 14 year old girl. They agree to meet at a local café called Nighthawks. Fine and dandy. The girl, named Hayley, shows up with a book bag and is eating chocolate cake when the man, Jeff, shows up to meet her.He tells her that he was at a concert that she was dying to go to. He tells her that he has a bootleg mp3 of the concert and will send it to her. That's not good enough for her. She weasels her way into going to his house. He is hesitant to let her go with him but she is very convincing so he allows it. Amongst their conversation he makes light of the fact that if he wanted to be with her, sexually, he would have to wait another 4 years. He also invites her to call her sister to let her know where she will be, she declines.Once they get back to his home he offers her a glass of WATER, she declines telling him that she was taught never to drink anything she doesn't make herself. She starts snooping around the kitchen and finds a bottle of vodka and pours herself a screwdriver as well as one for Jeff. She serves him his drink and continues her conversation with him about his photography. She begs him to take photos of her, which he is hesitant about but, again, he complies. She insists that instead of photographing in his studio that he takes her photos in the living room. He starts to get dizzy and feels weird. She continues to ask if he is okay. He starts to scream at her to sit down and be still so he can photograph her correctly. After which he falls over and passes out. When he awakens he is tied to a chair and has Hayley leering at him and making accusations of him being a pervert and a murderer of a missing girl. Over the next few hours Haley tortures this man and tries over and over again to get him to commit suicide for his actions against society. Again, it's a blurred line of whether or not he has actually done anything guilty but Haley is convinced that he is a pervert and a murderer and he must die.She straps him to a table after an attempted suffocation with plastic wrap. Takes his pants off and tells him that she is going to castrate him. She has all the necessary tools to do so. She is icing down his genitals to make the surgery less painful. She even sets up a video camera so that he can watch. She's laid her ground work for this to take place and begins. After she is finished she goes to shred the testicles in the garbage disposal commenting that that they weren't made of brass after all. She leaves to take a shower and Jeff struggles to get free. After he gets free he figures out that she never castrated him. He has a bull clamp on his scrotum which presented the feeling of the tugging that she was doing something. He checks the video camera and learns that it was a just a video tape on castration techniques playing on the TV. He gets his gun and goes to find her in the shower. When he gets there, she's not in the shower but hiding behind the door, expecting his arrival and shocks him with a stun gun repeatedly.After paralyzing him Hayley begins clean-up of any evidence that she was ever there. She threatens him that suicide is his only way out and that she will destroy any evidence that he has that he is a pedophile and had anything to do with that missing girl.At the movie climax, you think that this little punk is going to get her's, but it just doesn't happen. The movie messes with your mind and makes you so mad you just wanna throw your remote through the TV. Keep in mind that Jeff may be a sick twisted individual, but no one deserves what this little bitch put him through. Toss up of whether or not this movie is worth a crap or not but to me, it was just a waste of time.",Hard Candy
336,sunny_sust,"Powerful, disturbing and amazing performances",6,23 February 2015,Alright I will be straight and say that I didn't enjoy this movie. I didn't enjoy how it went and also didn't like the ending. To be precise I didn't like the character of Ellen Page. The character Hayley was really irritating and at times very painful to watch. But the acting of Ellen Page and Patrick Wilson was superb in fact they were so good that I almost wanted her to die and on the other hand felt bad for the character Jeff although he probably got what he deserved. But this is one of best psychological thriller I ever watched but the fact that I hated one of the main character so much is the reason I am giving it a average rating but I guess that was all part of the plan from the writer Brian Nelson.,Hard Candy
337,moskwiz,Vicious Cycle,8,3 September 2006,"I just finished watching Hard Candy and it made me sick to my stomach. But why that is, is for me to know and you (a viewer of this movie, to become) to find out. The plot is original, cast promising, scenery authentic, camera-work brilliant and direction superb. So in terms of a movie being good as a movie, this is a really good one.Of like and kind, this is another one of those desperation and 'corneredness' type of movies where the viewer finds him/herself trying to desperately yell out something in order for it to affect the further development of the plot, which does eventually start dragging just a little bit, making the desperation part especially cruel.Hard Candy has some minor anti-logic mistakes and here and there you start to wonder, why would she do that in the first place?

Rogue. Watch it. 8/10",Hard Candy
338,Giantjott,Not the movie I wanted it to be,4,22 December 2006,"First of all let me say that the acting in this film is extremely well done, in that it is very realistic which I'm sure was the intention. However, I'm not sure it's appropriate. Films of this content (meaning torture, as well as pedophilia) are a hard enough subject to tackle, and it is for this reason that some of the more successful, albeit infamous, examples of pedophilia and its effects on people as represented in cinema are more cartoonish (namely Todd Solandz's HAPPINESS), because this offers a detached viewpoint. I'm not one to shy away from provocative material, but by offering them in a more Brechtian light, we may gain a more productive perspective. By letting the audience off the hook from being forced into an uncomfortable situation of having to endure realistically horrendous acts there is no risk of repelling the audience that the film in fact intends to influence. But obviously this was not the plan of Hard Candy's director. Before going into this film I was intrigued by the premise of a role reversal where the typical predator (pedophiliac) becomes prey to a preternaturally diabolical 14-year-old girl. What I expected was an over the top, iconic psychological thriller where the pedophilia angle would be used to create preconceptions of the characters so that they could then be turned upside down. This is, in fact, how I felt for most of the film, until the unbearable ending in which the film's monster (Hayley) is glamorized as a sort of activist superhero. Upon viewing some of the extra features on the DVD I got the impression that the director had set up a sort of sting operation for the audience. David Slane talks of his work as a test of morality, posing the question of who you found yourself sympathizing with, as if sympathizing with the pedophile suggests a dangerously flexible code of ethics. But the film is obviously set up to portray the pedophile as protagonist (with the exception of the confession at the end, which is supposed to justify the girl's psychotic actions). Are we to be incriminated for reacting to deliberately crafted cinematic technique? Should we have reveled in the sadistic punishment of a troubled, albeit perverted, man? It is my opinion that the finger would be better pointed at anyone who found this material enjoyable. Let's face it, this film is not as much about pedophilia as it is about vigilante violence, and in this case the violence far exceeds its justification as the vigilante is clearly as psychologically warped as the pedophile. I can see why this film might be a joy ride for any man-hating feminist extremists, but I would hope that the average audience member experiences a healthy dose of recoil.As far as technique, flawless craftsmanship didn't save me from a difficult viewing experience. In fact, the slick, modern cinematography felt out of place for such a dirty little story, and some particularly stylized segments became distracting as I felt like I was watching a music video or car commercial. In conclusion, it should be said that an enjoyable viewing experience isn't required for a film to be considered a work of art. An avid fan of provocative cinema myself, I know the benefit of unsettling content as a means of gaining a reaction. But with Hard Candy, I can't help but question to what end we the audience have been subjected to this material, if not to make us guilty for our reactions.",Hard Candy
339,hadelec,Too grotesque,1,19 May 2021,This movie makes you very uncomfortable. It is really dark. Too grotesque for my liking. Otherwise Ellen Paige is an excellent actor. So is Patrick Wilson. Would love to see Ellen Paige as ellie in the last of us...,Hard Candy

341,omarramonmuniz,"Another torture film, another dollar",4,27 October 2007,"Hard Candy is probably, so far, the better of the ""torture"" films that have been released in the past 4 years (texas chainsaw remakes, Hostel, Wolk Creek, Turistas, Saw all included). However, it is a still a torture film, a genre that struggles to find any redeeming qualities. In Hard Candy, a teenager tortures a pedophile after he agrees to meet her at a local coffee shop. The acting and interaction between the two is relatively enjoyable for the first 20 minutes of the film. But once the torture begins, the teenager becomes nasty and unlikable, even though she is supposed to be a hero, or an anti-hero to the audience. Her character is written no different that the villains in other torture films. In fact, the confidence and ease that the teenager exhibits while performing these acts seems to abandon logic and makes her acts less heroic. Also, the pedophile's character remains likable throughout, the audience remains sympathetic to him. Hard Candy puts me in the uncomfortable position of rooting for the pedophile to escape torture. The idea is that because the pedophile is a bad person, watching him being tortured is supposed to be excusable or justified. But it just isn't. The film smothers its audience in the idea that pedophilia is wrong and it seems like this is supposed to work as a warning for active pedophiles. I found myself more upset at the teenager for being a vigilante than at the pedophile for being a pervert.",Hard Candy
342,king_ghidora,Mind-blowing.,8,8 January 2010,"Something about the camera work and the color scheme of the movie sort of got to me, but other than that, I absolutely loved ""Hard Candy"". Such a small cast, yet the movie has the enormous amount of power that a huge cast would have. Ellen Page is certainly at her best here, as she fearlessly overpowers a pedophile man and psychologically tortures him. When I say torture, no, I don't mean ""Saw"" or ""Hostel""-type torture. I mean, well, more humanized torture. ""Hard Candy"" is a highly upsetting movie, yet it is so intensely thought-provoking that it can leave you thinking for days. Some things in this movie are not as they seem; I had to watch this film two times to actually catch every detail. ""Hard Candy""'s ending is a dramatic, stress-inducing sequence, and if you are a more sensitive viewer it WILL creep you out. The dialogue throughout the film is powerful and well spoken, and it really grabs your attention. The movie's controversy revolves around its mature theme of pedophilia and revenge; therefore, it is something that for sure grabs your attention. ""Hard Candy"" is a must-see movie.",Hard Candy
343,billylarrick,Brilliant Independent Film,10,15 September 2015,"This film is everything every independent film should aspire to be.I had no idea that this movie would lead to Ellen Page becoming my favorite actress, that I would be blown away the acting genius who is Patrick Wilson, and that I would fully appreciate what a low budget film with nothing more than great acting, creative directing, and a thrilling story could accomplish.Acting Ellen Page and Patrick Wilson deserve Oscars for their performance in this movie. For a little over an hour and a half they are able to captivate an audience without a set larger than a few rooms or the assistance of any other characters, let alone special effects.Ellen's role as a sixteen-year-old girl who turns the tables on her would be predator is really a story of two roles. For the first half hour she sells the audience on her performance as a naïve, oblivious teenage girl who will do anything to impress mid-thirties Patrick Wilson, only to drop the charade and reveal her true character's nature as a ""cute, vindictive, little bitch."" Her transition from naïve to manipulative is an incredible transition that most actors in Hollywood could not pull off, which makes it all the more impressive that it's coming from eighteen-year-old Page. Her performance throughout the film is one of the most honest I've ever witnessed and the credits might as well say that Ellen Page never appears in this film but that Hayley is cast as herself. Not only is her character entirely believable but the range of emotions and the depth of her character is incredible; she is a combination of weakness, power, anger, sadistic joy, and sarcasm rolled into one. This range is fully displayed when she pretends to become reassured by Wilson that he will not punish her if she releases him. This movie, not Juno, marks the launch of her success as an actress.As fantastic as Page is in this movie, Patrick Wilson is arguably superior. His role as a thirty-something predator in disguise presents a challenge for any actor and Wilson more than delivers. He begins the movie as a coy, flirtatious, and confident man whose witty charm is only unsettling when the audience realizes it is being directed toward an adolescent girl. Just as Page transforms over the course of the movie, so too does Wilson. From a suave and seemingly innocent stranger Wilson becomes a helpless captive who plays with our sympathies and then, once his true nature is revealed, violent and emotional. Yet even as his character develops, peeling back the layers of his innocence to expose himself as a monster, Wilson's performance continues to project the sympathies that make his character so complex. What makes this movie so compelling is the conflict the audience should feel between condemning Wilson's character for being a pedophile and their sympathy for the terrible situation he is in at the hands of Page; much of this conflict is owed to Wilson's ability to sell the audience on his character.Dialogue Part of the brilliance of this movie should be credited to the screenwriter Brian Nelson. One unique aspect of this film is the nature of the dialogue between Page and Wilson. As the story of Wilson's alleged pedophilia and potential acts of murder unfolds, the audience is left wondering which character is the real monster. At first Wilson seems the obvious monster as Page confronts him about giving alcohol to a minor and being drugged by teenage flesh. ""Busted."" But the audience's judgement becomes muddled as Wilson attempts, through his dialogue, to convince the audience first of his innocence then that he is undeserving of his punishment. The audience is caught between an epic tug of war between Page and Wilson that leaves the matter of whether justice was served unresolved. While the performances from Page and Wilson are the drivers of the story, the intense and clever writing of Nelson is its vehicle.Directing From the opening scene, director David Slade introduces us to the types of innovative methods rarely used in mainstream movies; the decision to have the camera swivel and zoom in during the IM'ing between Page and Wilson, the early reference to Lensman319 which carries significant relevance later, and the symbolic use of red and blue in the text. This first scene is representative of Slade's brilliant directing throughout the film; he takes an ordinary and functional plot device (an IM chat which tells the audience that Page and Wilson have a flirtatious relationship and are making plans to meet for the first time) and very effectively enhances the audience's interest with his camera work. The gradual zooming in and lingering on particular lines of text provides an eerie and unsettling feeling that contrasts with the flirtatious tone of what Page and Wilson are typing. From the beginning of the movie the audience is held captive by the tension between these two characters and the uncertainty of what will happen next. This initial camera work subtly highlights that tension in the same way that creepy music enhances the audience's feelings of suspense in a horror movie. That Slade is able to achieve the same effect with the way he uses his camera is a testament to his directing abilities in this film.Conclusion: The greatest independent film and one of the best films in general I have ever seen. This movie reminds me of Casablanca on a lesser scale because of how well executed it is across the board: acting, directing, screenplay, etc. Films like this which don't require CGI or even more than a limited set and a couple actors are a refreshing reminder of how much film can do with so little.

344,michael1_4,"Overall well done, but a few holes in the plot",7,1 October 2006,"Spoiler warning This was a very riveting movie and it was done well.There were a few times though that he had chances to escape or to kill her and for some reason doesn't. That always annoys me when the characters do things that I don't believe they would actually do and there's a few of those times in this movie. The first time is when he has the gun but he is still strapped to the chair. Instead of backing up to a wall and waiting for her to come in to the bedroom where he would have a clear shot, he decides to wheel himself out into the open of the living room (where she could be hiding anywhere) and call out her name. Why would he do that? Also in the end scene, if he is going to kill himself anyway wouldn't he take her with him? He has about 5 straight minutes on the roof where he can grab her and kill her (at one point she is leaning on him with no defense) and then he could kill himself after if he thought that was the best option, but instead he kills himself without touching her. It made no sense. He's supposed to be a pedophile after all, if he kills her then he is a murderer too, but either way he's going to jail for a very long time so why wouldn't he kill her and then kill himself? That made no sense to me.Like I said it was done well in that it does keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the movie, and I would recommend it just for that, but it does annoy me when characters do things that I don't believe any person would ever do. It reminds me of all the horror movies where the person is being chased by some slasher type but then falls on the ground a hundred times and you wonder why would a person who seems to be able to walk and run normally in every day life all of a sudden become a stumbling fool when chased by a slow moving person in a hockey mask.The acting was very good by both main actors.",Hard Candy

346,okaycuckoo,"Good set-up, but loses pace",4,19 June 2006,"The film starts out with a nice piece of chat-room dialogue on computer screen, and the main characters - 32 yr old male photographer and 14 yr old girl - are introduced in a well-played coffee-house scene. They then head back to his place, and there is some self-conscious flirtation, before the girl brings us to a turning point, with a devilish piece of irony: she declines a drink, because it hasn't been fixed with her own hands, and then fixes him a drink spiked with some drug. He conks out, and wakes up tied to a chair - the ordeal begins.I stayed with this film for over an hour, past the point of no return - she discovers illegal photos and evidence of his involvement with a missing girl - but found myself getting bored even as the tension was mounting for the castration scene.The dialogue is good, and well-delivered, but there's far too much of it, as if the screenplay were an adaptation of a stage play. The set-up is good too, but after 20 mins I was uneasy thinking about how the next 90 mins was going to be filled up. And the girl is quite irritating - well-played, but inspiring no sympathy with her clever-clever superiority. It got to the point where I wondered how she could manage to haul the unconscious victim (? the big ISSUE) around the place. It may have been better if the set-up had been played with true eroticism, to give the turning point more emotional effect.The camerwork is energetic, and the scene where the girl has to subdue the man by smothering him with cellophane works well. The shadows in the girl's eyesockets in the photo-studio belie her innocence.",Hard Candy
347,dhlough,"Ambiguous, Elaborate Cat-and-Mouse Thriller",6,23 June 2006,"Hard Candy  billed as a ""psychotic thriller""  has a great central conceit: when the 14-year-old Hayley Stark (Ellen Page) meets the 32-year-old photographer Jeff Kohlver (Patrick Wilson) after a brief liaison online, the film sets in motion an ambiguous, elaborate cat-and mouse game between unlikely allies and victims.For roughly the first third of Hard Candy, director David Slade develops a queasy frisson between the precocious teenager and her smooth predator. These expository scenes are expertly played with uncomfortable nuance. The young actress Ellen Page is prodigious here, with the precise modulation of innocence and budding sexuality. But when she turns the tables on her would-be suitor  when she becomes the Hard Candy of the title  her performance loses its focus. While innocence and flirtatiousness are in the best end of her range, toughness and vengeance create a reliance on acting ticks. You see her trying too hard, and it guts the very threat necessary for the role  and the movie  to work.Patrick Wilson  with his strapping handsomeness and physicality  couldn't be better. He never begs for sympathy for his unsavory character, yet his choices are sneakily smart. He keeps us guessing  even in the midst of some lunatic situations  whether he really is the monster of the young girl's accusations. He's so convincing that a strange development occurs; while we flirt with the idea that this man may be the most heinous kind of sexual predator, our sympathies move from the doe-eyed innocent teen to her captive and very likely guilty victim.Even though Hard Candy doesn't work, we root for the film because it's trying to get at something  that delicate line between victim and prey, and the ages old dilemma of the lure, for certain men, of the teenage girl. It isn't every day we get a ""psychotic thriller"" about an avenging angel of pedophilia.",Hard Candy
348,ange_rankin,If anything thought provoking,6,13 October 2006,"While this movie may rely on shock value a little I did find it extremely entertaining and it definitely held my attention. It also touched on a very taboo subject.While most people will agree that pedophilia is wrong. It's very black and white. However this movie brought up the grey area's of pedophilia. How young is too young? Everyone will agree that a grown man with an 8 year is wrong, but this movie questions what about teenagers, the part of the population that mature body's with immature minds. Of course my boyfriend know my thoughts on this topic and while I consider those with immature minds whether 12 or 18 should be off limits to those older due to the power difference, I am well aware that many people do not share my opinion (after all I'm sure every girl has their own teenage story of old men that leer and hit on them). This movie also looked at what is acceptable conduct when the younger/person of least power is seducing the older/one with more power. Should the older person always be more responsible? Or is everyone just human? Maybe making mistakes and being taken advantage is part of growing up? We can say for certain that a teacher should always be able to refuse a student whether seduced or not,but what about too individuals?Another point brought up in this movie is the use of internet in this movie. It touches on how people hide themselves over the net, people look up things in seconds in order to impress others, how people can use anonymity of the net to indulge in fantasies they would other wise be able to. None of this is ground breaking revelations but just reinforces the issues.This movie may not be greatly scripted or Oscar winning, and maybe most of it's hype is drawn from its shock value, still it kept me interested and showed how a black and white issue can still be grey.",Hard Candy
349,liminalone,spinning for days...a ferocious film!,9,11 April 2006,"I saw this film for the first time this eve at the DGA in Hollywood. The excited and sincere David slade was a man of many words as he took the podium after the chair of lionsgate. Instead of the in-your-face director/auteurs one usually encounters in los angeles, David's enthusiasm for fimmaking shined through. the clever title sequence alone kept me chained to my seat and after the opening montage, I knew exactly what was in store for the audience.This film has left me spinning. Not since Gasper Noe's ""Irreversible"" have I squirmed so much in my seat. This is indie film-making at its finest and most clever. With a less than million dollar budget and 18 days of shooting, the film succeeded on multiple threads of the darker side of society.I simply loved it. From the extremely awkward and uncomfortable beginning to the terrific end. The sympathy one feels for the characters is terrific and the pacing along with dialogue is pitch perfect. I don't want to spoil this film for anyone by revealing the subtext, but the poster says it all.

350,dave-3001,Well acted thriller but wildly implausible,7,11 April 2008,"I couldn't really buy into the premise of this film. Reminded me a little of 8MM , another tale of a shocking sexual underworld created from a middle class world view. The interplay between the two leads was impressive and Ellen Page created a truly scary Annie Wilkes (Misery) obsessiveness. The camera-work drifting across the room using the photographers screen as a fade in and out was a good touch and the 'operation' had me squirming on my sofa. There may have been many people watching who thought this type of vigilante action was liberating, but the relationship between victim and perpetrator was always complex and for that reason alone it took this film into the category of 'should see'",Hard Candy
351,Dark_Venom,Example of ambivalence,6,23 March 2007,"Hard Candy is an interesting movie. Generally after having seen a movie, you can decide whether it was good or not, but Hard Candy's case is different.The plot is really simple, if we look at the core: a 14 years old girl's self-jurisdiction over a 32 years old pedophile. Well, it is far more complicated than that.Scene by scene we cheer to an other character: once we want Hayle (the girl) to fulfill her goal with Geoff (the pedo), and sometimes we may even think that this photographer guy isn't that bad, he's just a guy who has to suffer for more than he has committed. This thing ends up in not knowing who our character is - not to mention, both of them act illogically, and this makes us think: what happens in this movie?If we look at Hayle as a psychopathic ""judge"",then we may recognize a female Jigsaw (so to say, her character has been stolen from that movie). She claims to be a kind of guardian of every teenager who is terrorized by pedophiles. Well, it may sound positive, but she is soooo annoying! I mean, the character doesn't make us have good feelings for her. And Geoff? He is a handsome, talented photographer, who is intelligent, who would never be suspected to be such a pervert. During the movie we don't get an exact clue of him being a real monster, and in a huge part of the film we may find ourselves even cheer for him to survive . Ambivalency in characters continues in the film itself. The story gives us tons of questions, but no answers. This is practically a good idea in an independent film, but I don't really like when the creators do it in a way that the film ends up its own parody. And the tense, psychotic atmosphere sometimes becomes banality, and some illogical scenes makes the film being far from reality (well, if I mentioned Saw as a related film, I shall notice, that it had illogical moments, but it didn't spoil the film). However, the cinematography and the editing is quite unusual, but gives a nice pulse to the movie, so we are not bored.The problem? The message of the danger of the Internet-pedophiles does not come off the screen. What we see is self-jurisdiction. We can't decide if Haley truly does everything for the girls who are molestated, or she is just a disturbed person. We don't really know if Geoff is a real monster, or only Haley wanted him to be more than an average Internet-worm. We get questions, but no nice dilemmas like Saw. There are no goals and motivations to be judged, only situation which can be subjective. Even if Geoff got what he deserved, the whole story and acting is too ambivalent and confusing to make up as a whole.Conclusion? Not good, but far from bad - a nice independent movie which can make you think about it, or about the question: what did the creators want to make?",Hard Candy
352,Phill_E,Kick-butt heroin in a kick-butt movie!,8,29 September 2007,"This movie was just plain and simple good. It steps away from all of the detectives, and all of the police, and all of the 'save-the-day boyfriends', and instead fallows '14' year-old Hayley Stark (Ellen Page). And the eerie antagonist, Jeff Kohlver (Patrick Wilson).Plot: Hayler meets Jeff over the internet, and asks to have a photo-shoot. As they meet, both characters are carefully working their wit to each other. And as good foreshadowing and good build up shows, Hayley has the upper hand. She works her way into his head and gathers as much info as she can from what she thinks is a pedophile. As time moves on, this movie turns into an exciting thrill-ride with unsuspecting twists coming from each character.As stated before, this movie is a step-away from the blood-and-guts, and a crazed torturer trying to talk sense into unsuspecting citizen. Hard Candy turns the tables, and instead had the protagonist doing the dirty deeds. Hayley has all the right moves, and perfectly devises her plan against Jeff, and never lets off. With some of the best acting I've seen from a teen, she pulls off what some adult actors try to do. Even Patrick gives us the bang for our buck with his talent. As both characters continuously shift rolls in the hour and a half power struggle, this movie really proves it has it all.

Instead, I was treated to a unique and very clever psychological thriller that keeps you uncertain as to exactly which character you're rooting for.Right from the off, the movie has a decidedly uncomfortable, something's-not-right feel. Then it hits you with a twist and suddenly the movie becomes a whole lot more interesting and engaging.So what is it that makes this movie? A new and original film idea presented through a very well-written script, delivered by two very talented actors, and backed up by fantastic film-making.I don't know if it's a movie I'd watch again in a hurry (the subject matter is just slightly too... *shivers* ... for me) but it was definitely a worthwhile addition to my collection and one that I'll certainly watch again at some point.",Hard Candy
355,cjaymet,Protagonist has total control throughout the movie = Good????,2,25 July 2020,"There are a million reasons why this film fills me with bottomless depression but I'll try to leave personal problems to a minimum and explain on an aesthetic reason why Hard Candy fundamentally does NOT work as a movie.The biggest flaw with this film is there is no dynamic or power shift to it. The first 10 minutes is Jeff and Hayley talking and then going back to Jeff's house. These moments are the only parts of the movie I praise. The conversations they have flow very nicely which has an unnerving amount of uncomfortableness given the context. The fact that a conversation between an older man and a teenage girl who met online could sound this natural is honestly unsettling at times especially in how innocent it all seems. But then Jeff gets knocked out and wakes up to find himself subdued by Hayley, and it pretty much stays here for the rest of the movie. This kind of power struggle worked fine in the movie Misery, where we were meant to identify with the captive character and wanted them to escape. But that doesn't seem to be the case here. The movie clearly wants us to root for Hayley in her physical and psychological torture on Jeff. I get it, ""subversion of expectations of roles"" and all that Jazz. That certainly could work but for an ENTIRE movie? I can't think of a single halfway decent film where the protagonist is in complete control of the villain for 90% of the film. Maybe this could work for a short film but for a 1h 40m movie, it's only able to accomplish this by dragging it out at a wretched pace that only exacerbates the misery of what's happening on screen.The movie has several opportunities to improve but it just continues to chug along with no relevant power shifts. Sure the film gives glimmers of that before squashing them outright. There's a moment in the first half where Jeff, tied to a chair, manages to get to his gun but Hayley wraps plastic wrap around his face until he stops moving. As she steps back to take in what she's done my intrigue heightened. ""Did she kill him? This clearly wasn't how she wanted to carry this out but now that something hasn't gone as planned she's left in a house with a tied-up corpse that clearly didn't kill himself so what is she gonna do now?"" But just as I lean forward with interest it's revealed that he's NOT dead, only passed out. Just a speed bump and now it's on to Hayley's next phase of taunting. Similarly, later in the film, Hayley has to keep Jeff quiet while she answers the door for a guest (Sandra Oh) who is looking for him. Another great opportunity; ""Is Sandra going to discover what Hayley is doing and now Hayley is put in a crisis of conscience? She needs to kill this woman in order to keep her plan going but doing so means killing an innocent bystander and going against her principles!"" Nope, Hayley is able to divert the guest away, and then it's back to our regularly scheduled torture. It was like the movie kept wanting to tease me with the idea that it was going to turn into a good movie but kept going ""Syke!""We get a little background on Jeff and his life outside the movie's events. I won't say it ""endears"" us to him, but it gives us, as an audience, more to latch on to which is more than I can say about Hayley. Forget the fact that she is one of the most smarmily, obnoxiously smug, supremely unlikable characters I've ever seen in any movie, but we don't know the slightest thing about her. As the film makes very clear near the climax, we have no idea if anything she's said during this film is true or just part of the ruse. I kept waiting for her to espouse some tragic backstory on how she's been abused and now she does to pedophiles what she wasn't able to do then. Not that you HAVE to have a tragic backstory in order to hate pedophiles but, as is, there's no reason to care about her. What you get is a story telling you to feel one way but unconscious emotions nudging you to feel the other way. The movie's framing is at war with basic character development.I was willing to cut the screenplay a little slack at first because I was fairly certain the film was probably written by someone who suffered at the hands of a pedophile and that writing a story like this was probably very cathartic for them. But it turns out it was inspired by a real case of Japanese school girls assaulting would-be pedophiles, and then Brian Nelson (whose work I like outside of this) wrote the screenplay. It's said that the final screenplay was the first draft which honestly makes too much sense. What we got really does feel like an early concept that needed to be kicked around a little more. I see people praise this screenplay for being smart but I don't think it's ultimately all that smart. It certainly sounds like what a teenager thinks is smart and deep, but Hayley's monologues are not realistic at all. She sounds nothing like a real 14-year-old girl and that's to say nothing of the number of times she overpowers and outsmarts Jeff. There are a number of things she does in the movies that just aren't believable for someone her size and age. I kept waiting for her to reveal that she was actually in her 20's, which still wouldn't have explained everything but would have made a little more sense. Not to mention the amount of information she's been able to get about Jeff's background and the level of depth she's supposed to understand him. I've never liked characters that ALWAYS know what their opponent is going to do, and ALWAYS has the upper hand, and any attempt to outmaneuver them plays exactly into their plan. This movie is just a wish-fulfillment fantasy of one of the most grotesque kind. If you're going to make it this heavy on him the film should have made Jeff among the worst kinds of child molesters. There is sadly no shortage of those in real life. I get that they were aiming to play Jeff as a more run-of-the-mill creeper but using an entire movie's worth of all this unrelenting torment feels like a waste.Ultimately this film wreaks of trying too hard and squanders some decent direction as well as Ellen Page and Patrick Wilson's dependable performances. It may be called Hard Candy but it in fact leaves a VERY bitter after taste.",Hard Candy
356,thelittleother,OK mainstream thriller that won't change your life,5,19 February 2012,"First thing to say is that I watched this late at night, expecting to break the movie at a suitable point and finish it the next day; in the event I ended up watching the whole thing because the pace is pretty relentless and I was completely drawn in. It's an attempt to do that taut, psychological two-people-trapped-in-a-box thing and it's definitely not boring. I was pleased to find that, despite its reputation, this isn't a ""torture movie"".But I had a lot of problems with it. The characters are two-dimensional and their motives are largely unexplored -- an apparently regular guy spends most of the film being terrified of an emotionless psychopath. I don't suppose the writer had spent much time around 14-year-olds recently: Ellen Page does a decent job with the role but she's basically playing a Bond villain. The film seems ready to end at around the 60-minute mark but then just inexplicably carries on. Most of the things that happen are much too contrived to be believable, physically and otherwise, and that hurts the film's ability to keep the tension up. The ""twist"" at the end makes a nonsense of some of what Page's character has said and done up to that point.This is a film that promises to be about something -- paedophilia, perhaps, vigilante justice, internet relationships, the importance of reputation or the collision of adulthood with adolescence -- but doesn't deliver any food for thought. The ending ties everything up neatly, leaving us with a clear idea of who's the hero and who's the villain.A fun date movie, very watchable while it's on but ultimately rather hollow.",Hard Candy
357,mavoro,Im afraid most people don't see it.,8,23 June 2015,"This is a Movie about a Intelligent girl, i even go further and say a genius girl. Most normal people fantasize about castrating a child molester so her motives don't need to be questioned. Maybe she lost her friend/sister or someone she loves to sick bastards like this guy. Anyway the next thing people seem to miss is that actually most child molesters tend to be your next door nice guys this is shown perfectly in this movie and i wasn't fooled by this guy for a single second. Im sorry for those believing or liking him but thats the thing you cannot know who is someone like him and who isn't until you find proof or are a young girl in a situation no one wants to be in. Sadly this will probably rarely to never happen since the scene of child molesters are super protective about each other and mostly quite intelligent themselves. But if anyone it would be a girl like her i believe her thou the full movie i rooted for her every damn second and i cant even see how you cant. Shure she should have called the cops but they wont have the proof they need to put him on the chair so yeah thats the only option. She doesn't wanna loose her life nor her future and you feel it all the way. The end is perfect with her already knowing everything all makes sense she still is playing to search for something she already has to just find out if there is any regret any last bit of humanity in him. If he breaks down and tells her anything she is satisfied and sends him to hell with the knowledge he felt what his victims felt (her first victim). In the end you know he is the killer and thats quite satisfying since he is the worse of them. Hope she majors in psychology and helps girls being molested / abused in the future it would just make sense. Her time is running out she isn't of use as a bate when she gets older so this dudes are her only victims and she getting the most out of it. You go girl!",Hard Candy

I just cannot say enough about her acting ability; this film will make me seek out more of her work.Now, back to the film, the story line begins with some all too familiar, present day internet happenings only to very quickly twist and turn into something quite suspenseful. Although long winded, the movie will keep you intensely interested for what comes next.Without spoiling anything I have to stop here for fear of letting something out of the bag, however I cannot stress enough the fact that the movie is well worth the rental fee, make sure to check out all of the special features on the DVD, just make sure you do not view them until after you have watched the movie.I rated this film 8 out of 10, fell short of 10 only due to it's length and a few quirky film tricks that just didn't cut it for me, however for a low budget suspense flick this movie just looks to good from start to finish, totally amazing what the right people can do with a good story and some fine performances.",Hard Candy
359,emlynaddison,This cockamamie film disallows suspension of disbelief,2,1 August 2009,"Actually, don't let my two-star rating mislead you: The acting is very strong in this film, but the story and plot are so utterly and atrociously defective, misguided and self-gratifying as to render the entire exercise pointless and the viewer wholly unfulfilled.When you begin to wish death on the leading character within 20 minutes of the film's exposition, you become aware that you're consumed not with the story, but the protagonist's (read: antagonist's) immediate and violent demise.When I saw Page in ""Juno"" I thought she acted too old for the character's age; too self-assured and mature. In this case (now playing a 14-year-old) the disparity between age and behavior/language is even greater.And when this little 14-year-old behaves as if the likelihood of her being caught is a patent impossibility (as if instructed by the script) and is always--and without exception--a step ahead of a seemingly cautious and highly intelligent adult, one can only question the scriptwriter.This film disallows suspension of disbelief. A colossal and unmitigated failure of film-making.Consider:1. How does she find the man in an otherwise anonymous chat room in the first place?2. How does she move his limp body, not just onto a chair, but onto a table? Let alone hanging from a cross beam? Beyond absurd.3. How does she not electrocute herself with the stun gun if both are covered in water from the shower?4. Where did she learn to handle a gun so deftly (you can read about gun skills on the web all you want, but actually holding and operating a heavy pistol is another matter)?5.

Intelligence of characters are very inconsistent. A moment you'll see our main girl do something incredibly smart and then incredibly stupid and retarded. Same goes for the guy.Extremely predictable, I could see events from miles away. Half of the movie I was like ""don't""...Now this part is going to be a little out of topic but, why the hell is it too bad to be a pedophile, but watching him tortured for more than an hour is OK? Who thinks this is good? People really feel good watching a man experiencing hell on earth? Do you think murderers, rapists, thieves etc. should be tortured to madness, to suicide? I'm really disappointed in humanity. Especially after seeing this movie's score.Best part about this movie is it helped me understand how the religious concept of hell might be invented by people.

Well scripted, well acted, and well directed, but, and it's a big but, the suspension of disbelief ultimately fails. SPOILER!!!! How did Hayley know that the showdown would be acted out on the roof, with the necessary foresight to arrange the ending? She couldn't have done. And that is what ruins the film. With this kind of subject matter, more nihilism and less plot twist is required. The reliance on the repetition of escape-capture might have you on the edge of your seat but the contrivance fails to convince, so yet again we end in the tired old cliché of formulaic Hollywood; Halloween, Friday 13th, blah blah blah. If ever a good film was ruined by the last 15 minutes, this is it. Even metaphysical allegories require internal logic.",Hard Candy
362,edouard_monpetit,The whole is much less than sum of all parts,3,10 November 2006,"There is something wrong with Hard Candy.The acting was solid, the direction was intelligent, the script was intense, and the topic is controversial. All these elements, however, didn't quite converge to something that was coherent and compelling. It lacks the premise, credibility, and balance that any good film should process. This may be a result of difference of expectations that originate from the actors, the director, the writer and the audience.Let's start with us, the viewers. Despite the topic, I believe ""Hard Candy"" is simply a film that entails a two-hour power struggle between two individuals. Pedophilia set the plot in motion, but did not tightly define the roles, which were purposely left ambiguous from beginning to end. No one knows if Jeff is really a child molester, and Hayley may either be a vigilante or a psychopath. The shift in physical and psychological domination between the two should have been our interest. Instead, our judgment on the characters were tainted, either as a result of the controversial topic, or by the Liongate marketing department. So, when the film started, we already charged Jeff guilty of pedophilia.This could have been compensated with a strong screenplay. However, Nelson managed to ignore natural and reasonable character development in the script. He did so mostly to strengthen Hayley's character. In the end, Hayley became the preacher, and Jeff the violated alter boy. Hayley's lines consisted mostly of monologues on quoting national statistics and degradation of social morals. Jeff, on the other hand, was only allowed to utter incomprehensible verbal jabs when Hailey takes a break from one of her soliloquies, provided that he wasn't on a gag. Maybe working with such a controversial topic, one has to play the party line to what is politically correct. Nelson really wanted the audience to be on Hayley's side, regardless how sinister her character is, but this does not justify a totally lob-sided screenplay.And the acting amplified the imbalance of the roles. Page and Wilson are no stranger to acting. I think their performance stand very well on their own, especially considering how little Wilson has to work with in his portrayal of Jeff. The disparity between the two characters made their efforts futile in salvaging the script. Page, convicted and energetic, dominated every scene in the film, whether she was in or not. On the other hand, Wilson, being tied up and gagged for most of the film, was reduced to acting scared. Sandra Oh's brief appearance was a reminder how contrived the whole film has become.Finally, there was the direction. Spade's background in directing commercials clearly showed. Most of the scenes are static, and transitions were limited to fade-in, fade-out, and panning across a black wall. He also had the propensity of using bright color everywhere. He certainly knows how to capture my attention for 15 seconds, but I felt comfortable after prolonged exposure. To his credit, he had made the best out of what he had to work with, namely, a lob-sided plot line, a minimal head count, and a confined space.In summary, Hard Candy started with a good premise, good casting, good direction and a keen audience. Page and Spade could chalk one up for this film, but the film itself has failed to become bigger than the sum of its parts.",Hard Candy
363,kc1177,Riveting.,9,14 January 2007,"I haven't been held captive by a movie like this since ""Crash"". It is hard to discuss this one without giving the prospective viewer too much information. I went into this one blind and would suggest that same approach to anyone planning to see it. There are so many plot twist and moments where you just aren't sure what will happen. I felt like I was being led around by the hand. I feel that I often have the ending of a movie before the first five minutes have played-not this one. There is no typical Hollywood formula to follow with Hard Candy. This is an incredibly tightly constructed story. It is compact and sparce--only two sets and what? four actors! Unbelievably intense. Incredible acting. Can't wait to see more from Ellen Page.",Hard Candy
364,michael-sj-lee,Can't see the appeal,5,7 January 2007,"so, I watched this film without knowing completely what to expect. I knew it was about a pedophilia but that's about it. I found the movie to be unpredictable in the ""that so illogical"" sense. Granted we were dealing with a 14 yr old righteous psychopath and a pedophile. I didn't get the message either. Is it a big @&!* you to pedophiles from underage girls? Is that really all the movie was about? I'm not trying to belittle underage boys/girls or women who have been taken advantage of but seriously, to make a movie where that's all it's about is senseless. Rape and pedophilia is about domination and control over the helpless victim and the role reversal was the only thing novel about the film. Overall, I found nothing to be insightful or otherwise original. I'd like to point out that even though I don't like Sandra Oh (mostly cause she's fugly), I found her brief appearance brought a breath of sanity to a ridiculous situation and an overall ridiculous movie. I don't think I'd recommend this movie to many people because it just doesn't make sense most of the time and approaches the edge of tastelessness for most of the movie. Spoilers from here on out***So at the end, the pedophile decides he rather hang himself than deal with all the humility and shame of what he had done and potential jailtime for the mysterious disappearance of whatsherface (diane?). Haley wanted this all along without her presence there being known. So what was the point of staging the castration? to scare him to admitting in participating in diane's death? What's her obsession with Diane? Why could the pedophile suddenly break free of the rope after the supposed castration when he had all that time before his castration? I don't understand haley's decision to become this psycho champion of underage girls' rights. Nothing justified her decision (maybe except that it's just generally wrong). Even then, her vigilante spirit is undeserving of accolade.",Hard Candy

367,klofkorn-1,Incredible Fairy Tale,4,14 August 2006,"This film was well made, but IMO fell down in one important aspect: that is, the anti-heroine (Haley) is portrayed as a 14 year old who is apparently capable of pulling of a kidnap-murder that would have put a mafioso to shame. Sure, the film is well crafted in most respects. The plot would have been plausible if Haley had been cast as a 16- or 17- year old. But then the pedophile bit wouldn't have plucked at the audience heartstrings as well. Sorry, but a 14-year old just doesn't have the life experience to pull off a crime of this sort without leaving a trail of evidence behind. Sure, there are kids that age vicious enough to do this sort of thing; but vicious enough and smart enough and well-educated enough to pull this off successfully at 14 is not credible.The film has its moments. The faux-castration scene is very well done. The Achilles' Heel though is just that it would take someone just a bit older to pull it off. A 14 year old just wouldn't have it together enough to cover her tracks like that. Sixteen or seventeen would have been more credible; it just wouldn't have had such potential to get the audience worked up over the pedophilia angle.Then there was the scene with the little vixen hacking the combination to the safe. Lacks credibility from a couple of standpoints at least. Not only does she guess the digital combo (he having graciously provided it in easily hacked form) but he has some dubiously allegedly incriminating photo in there? In this day and age any such memento would be digital & encrypted and not left for some prying eye to scope out in real time hard copy.Not only that, but in the end, wouldn't anyone have killed the little criminal (Haley) given the chance (which he was)? Why would anyone let that little punk walk away from the scene? The film would have been more interesting and a bit more credible had he taken her with him.",Hard Candy

While the dialogue could easily have been made dull and cliché by the majority of Hollywood talent, Ellen Page and Patrick Wilson OWNED these roles. Every subtle expression, inflection, movement, everything these two bring to the screen captivates the viewer completely. I am disappointed with many of the criticisms I've seen here about the movie. This movie was not made to have a neat and tidy moral message, primarily because there ARE NO neat and tidy morals. Crime and justice are brilliantly juxtaposed by the initial ambiguity of who is the criminal and who is the victim. I can see how it might trouble your average American viewer, who wants to see crimes vilified and justice pure and righteous (I call it the ""Die Hard"" syndrome). Here, we are first brought to empathize with the criminal as a victim and see the hand of justice to be brutal and apathetic, before slowly revealing the criminal for his deeds and the avenger for her purpose. Throughout the movie, the role of predator and prey changes multiple times, and the viewer is left to contemplate how narrow the definition can be between the two. This film was done so well, there is little room for improvement. My only complaint is that the ending is too neat, and there were at least 2 occasions where I felt that Haley made mistakes that her character was too smart to make, but that were convenient for plot development. Highly recommended for people who are open-minded enough to suspend personal judgments for the duration of the movie in order to fully explore both the humanity and inhumanity of both the criminal and the avenger of justice.",Hard Candy

I truly can't find any point to this movie if you don't give half a rat's ass about the psychological profiling and lecturing the girl was constantly blabbing about, and once she finally shut up and Jeff got free I started rooting for him because I knew once he got caught again we'd have to listen to another one of Hailey's boring speeches that never really got anywhere. I guess this movie is good for giving people a warm fuzzy that there are people out there willing to do what is deemed necessary by college people who think Jeff's lifestyle so sick and revolting that they're holding a petition against models who stunt their growth through teenage malnourishment in dedication to this movie next week. Sorry guys, but I've got better things to do.",Hard Candy
381,fUSEbURNER,Great movie with a strong message,9,10 November 2006,"A smart intense movie with solid acting and a thrilling sequence. The movie starts with what appears to be a photographer called Jeff ""Patrick Wilson"" trying to solicitude a 14 year old honor student called Hayley ""Ellen Page"" into a relationship with him through the internet, but things are not the way they seem as what appeared to be an innocent little girl is not so innocent after all! After going to his place, Hayley starts a Gestapo routine in hopes she could uncover any pedophilic activities for Jeff, specifically regarding a girl who went missing in their area.The movie is beautifully made and the film's decoration and coloring schemes are marvelous. The film itself is not only an intense suspense thriller; it also gives a strong message about pedophilia through the intense conversations between the main characters.A must see movie for suspense and thriller lovers. Actors did their part wonderfully - though Sandra Oh's short appearance was not needed. I hope her ugly looks and stupid acting never gets her a pity-for-minority award ever again.",Hard Candy
382,stefinlithuania,Crap Handy,1,12 March 2010,"The first movie by a clip director. Filmed in 18 days in two locations. And they kept the budget lower than a million dollar (1,000,000 $). The movie is very stupid, most of what happens has no logic (many reviews point that out; I'll add that if you have a sadistic teenager in your home and you are tied to a chair with a gun in one hand, would you really roll in the chair to pursue her, instead of freeing yourself??). There is no clear evidence of the male character guilt, no motives for him to hang himself, in any case all the evidence is against the sadistic girl and not the tortured one. Unless keeping a picture in your safe is some kind of a crime. Really bad.",Hard Candy
383,Delta Matt,Watch Misery.,2,7 November 2006,"This film comes straight from the great independent film tradition which states that all one needs to do in order to craft the framework of a film is to exhibit the most sordid parts of depressing real life you can possibly imagine. Entertainment and storyline are things that all those pointless, big-budget studio films do.Sarcasm aside, this film was like watching ""Misery"" with not-quite-as-good actors in it, and a not-quite-as-good script. Someone more pedantic would point out to me the most noticeable difference; in ""Hard Candy"" the situation is completely reversed. The Annie Wilkes of this film (played by Ellen Page) is supposed to be the heroine of the piece; torturing paedophiles to meet out justice upon them.Therein lies the problem. The part of the heroine is played in such a way that it is impossible to feel any sentimentality towards her, and therefore it is next to impossible to get behind her cause. Indeed, the similar character of John Doe in the film ""Se7en"" is a more likable character: and his exploits are far more villainous than those of Hayley.What little storyline there was was delivered to us via the way of supposed revelations made by our two main characters, and I think that these revelations were supposed to be ""twists"". The fact that after about twenty minutes I really didn't care about what either were saying meant that these revelations had considerably less impact than I believe the writer had hoped. A teenage girl brandishing a pair of scissors and announcing that she was going to castrate the gentleman tied down in front of her might demand some kind of a reaction in most films; in ""Hard Candy"", I simply gazed that the timer on my DVD player, gauging how much time it would take for the writer to get around to acting on this threat.This leads me on to another point: that this film is simply too long for its plot. Ten minutes in we have our premise for the remainder of the film - he's tied down and she's not happy with him. From then on, there are roughly five pivotal moments, and an awful, awful, awful lot of saying the same things over and over again ad infinitum, with the film reaching a predictable conclusion. This was a half an hour/forty-five minute short that got stretched to breaking point because someone wanted to make a feature length film without coming up with a feature length storyline.And where was the damn music? Some people may think that making an entire film with only about five minutes of music is new and bold, I think it's pretentious and ridiculous. Time and time again have good scores proved that music can be as important within a film as the main characters themselves; indeed, the music should BE a character.I think it might have been hoped that the controversial basis for the plot would be enough to convince people that the film is worth watching; it does contain an important message. However, the production staff behind ""Hard Candy"" are not the first to think this and be totally wrong. We in Britain (and across the water in France) have been the Kings of doing this since the early nineties, which is probably why despite some notable successes, our home-grown film-making business has been in a deplorable state for years.The purpose of a fictional film (be it independent or studio, moralistic or all out fun) is to entertain the audience. ""Hard Candy"" did not entertain in the least. It was boring, it was pretentious, and it attempted to be high-brow when the creators of the film are quite obviously completely non-creative.",Hard Candy
384,darkangel_5,I guess I have to be Devil's Advocate,2,26 January 2007,"Highly recommended by my friends and net-friends, I got this movie and settled into my sofa with a bucket of popcorn and a grin. I was all ready for a tense and steamy jousting match between Jeff Kohlver (Patrick Wilson) and Hayley Stark (Ellen Page).Lets begin with what worked. The premise was pretty good. A teenager inverse-stalks some guy she thinks is a pedophile, even going into his lair towhatever. The cinematography through the whole thing was good in the beginning, devolving to fair at the end.Unfortunately, what evolves is a maddening, easily predictable, implausible, amateur torture session narrated by over-acting Ellen Page. Whenever she started rattling after the first 20 minutes or so my finger would twitch to press the mute button. It only goes down hill from there.At several points during the film I yelled out ""KILL HER, YOU MORON!"" to the TV, but Jeff didn't hear me. I'm fairly sure he's brain damaged considering the mind-numbingly bad things he does.However, my lack of empathy soon extended from Ellen's character to everyone in the flick and I leaned back with a snort of disgust, saying: ""All right *bleep*, you deserve what you get."". Only sheer will and a ""lets watch the train-wreck"" fascination kept me watching.In the beginning, I was looking forward to Sandra Oh's appearance but by the time she arrived I just waved my glass of Jack & Coke to the TV and said: ""Who cares. You're going to be too stupid to notice anything."" I wasn't surprised.I can understand how younger women would find this movie interesting from a ""lets control the man"" point of view, similar to Y TU MAMÁ TAMBIÉN (which was awesome). I'm assuming that some submissive male masochists might like it as well.Ultimately, I guess I just don't understand a movie that relentlessly and brainlessly kicks a character for its entire length without a message. I mean, what was the point? 2/10.",Hard Candy
385,emplehod-2,One of the worst movies of all time.,1,19 November 2009,"It's really difficult to describe just how awful this movie is. I have seen quite a lot of movies, having been a theater projectionist for four years. The entire story was ludicrous. If they wanted to create sympathy for the girl then they should have made the man out to be more like the predator instead of the victim. Although his early actions were probably not the most appropriate, he didn't appear to be pressing the girl into anything. She seemed to be the one encouraging him. Okay, maybe I can't view this from the mindset of a pedophile, which is good for me. But I spent most of the movie worrying about the guy and sort of actually hoping he'd get free at some point and kill the girl. Somehow, I don't think that's the message the creators were trying to convey. Sorry, but I just don't see how this film benefits anyone.",Hard Candy
386,chikinlikinlou,Love it!,8,30 December 2006,"F'king incredible - loved it, one you can only watch once but that stays with you for years. Well worth a watch if you can face it - its heavy material and not for the faint hearted or weak stomached or people who cant hack intellect :) It starts very simply and goes one way then bam it flips over and the defence attacks, its chilling for the most part because it is so unpredictable. It is hard to see what is bullshit and what is not. Then there are some strange twists which keep the suspense going.When the end finally arrived I was not quite sure who was worse. It keeps you thinking and drawing your own conclusions - you'll need an hours break after watching it to let your mind settle.All in all, it is an amazing film and well worth every minute :)",Hard Candy

I have seen all kinds of movies, all kinds of genres, bad and excellent movies, movies from many, many countries in several different languages, but this movie is surely disturbing and so intensive. The cinematography is excellent. The acting was fabulous and believable.I have read some comments about this movie, and some talk about feminism and how it's presented in this movie. Well, the last thing I thought about while watching this movie is feminism, after all we are talking about a 14 year old girl on a crusade against pedophilia... I think this movie does an excellent job on showing a most delicate subject, and I can only recommend it. Go see this movie, and seriously, don't think about feminism while watching this, you really would have missed the point...",Hard Candy
388,tedthorne,And the message is?,2,14 October 2008,"If you like movies that advocate for psychopath vigilante style torture and murder, and where the psychopath vigilante gets away with it then Hard Candy is for you. Especially when the psychopath vigilante is driven by a hypocritical philosophy of life, acting on no evidence whatsoever but only self-deluded narrow-minded suspicions. Hard Candy is designed for the feminists, and man-haters alike will love this film. After a very intriguing set up the film fails to deliver and is a HUGE disappointment for the general public. As no motive is revealed for the actions of the vigilante, nor is there enough depth shown into the victim and as to his motives for wanting to extract revenge and not justice.",Hard Candy
389,Darrell_H,Some reviews unjustifiably too critical,8,14 July 2012,"I am talking in particular here about the reviews that basically criticize the content of the film even though it is as described. Torture is used in the IMDb storyline. Victim, predator and prey are also used in the marketing. The storyline is also clear that it involves a fourteen year old and a possible pedophile. Despite this some of the most critical reviews take issue with the storyline for these very reasons. It is hardly fair to criticize a film for being what it says it is.Hard Candy is worth watching just for the great performances by Ellen Page Juno) and Patrick Wilson (A Gifted Man). The provocative title hardly does the film justice, it is a very intelligent psychological thriller that keeps you engrossed.",Hard Candy

To put it in a category I would say its a Drama. Plot is designed around only two characters. Best feature of this movie is unpredictability to assume what would happen the very next moment. This movie, though has some content which not everybody would appreciate, but for others it would be quintessential. Actors have done their part well. This movie leaves a lot of unanswered questions (that's why you would see a lot of threads opening and closing in FAQ section). You may also want to watch this movie back to back again to get hints on certain things.

393,Gradomyr,Which side was I on? None,1,22 December 2006,"The pedophiles are the current public scarecrows. I know real people who'd never let their kids out of their sight because they might instantly become pedophile victims. So you put a ""pedophile"" label on a character and now you can do anything to him. And many viewers will blindly approve. My point of view is that the movie is not about ""the mind of a pedophile"" or ""revenge for all little girls"". It's about a mentally ill person who wishes to gain an absolute power over another person and how much she enjoys the process. And the process is shown in much detail. And there is not much besides it. I don't see any other way but come to a conclusion that this process is what the movie was actually shot for. Everything else was just a cover. A comfortable excuse for those who likes to watch that kind of stuff as it was an excuse for the main female character who liked to perform it. The tag-line of this movie should be: ""It's okay to burn witches and enjoy it because they are witches! Now let's watch how they writhe in the fire.""",Hard Candy
394,thomas-watts,The obscure object of fairytale,6,21 August 2013,"The film's poster draws an obvious visual parallel to the fairytale the ""Little Red Riding Hood"". Bruno Bettelheim's ""The Uses of Enchantment"" sees these kinds of stories as functioning like ""magic mirrors which reflect certain aspects of our inner universe and the processes which are required for the passage from immaturity to maturity"" (adapted quotation). ""Little Red Riding Hood"" should be therefore seen as a symbolic narrative engaging the thematic of sexuality as a rite of passage; the wolf representing the potentially threatening and dangerous facets of the experience. Every tale containing its own moral lesson, this one warns young girls on blindly entrusting strangers. The main spin on which the film relies is the inversion of the natural logic of predation, making the hunter the hunted. This predicament would not strike us as fundamentally original, if it weren't for the treatment of the subject through a modern lens and context. Indeed, figures of juvenile righters of wrong or helpless young girls hiding superpowers (see Japanese manga) are numerous nowadays and correspond to a tendency in fiction to reject the traditional portrayal of children and teenagers as defenseless creatures. Not unlike the ethos of cinema in the modern age wanting to endorse the role of an alternative pedagogue, different technological mediums are liable to trigger precocious maturity and autonomy (the contrary is, of course, also true). Therefore, achieving awareness of the outer world or taking one's life in charge becomes possible without the necessary guidance of adults, other surrogate intermediaries serving as formative tools (media, internet, etc.). ""Hard Candy"" is reliant on this context, but seems to tackle the problematic on a much more multi-dimensional level as one will see.The action is confined to a closed-door thriller; two characters set in an agonistic confrontation of devious emulation. Hayley's avatar ""Thonggrrrrrl14"" is testimony to her art of sham and fake persona. The number gives away carelessly her age, while the pseudo conflates the word ""thong"" (bearing the double meaning of footwear and lingerie, both erotic fetish triggers) with some kind of phonetic faux mimicking the growling of a wolf. The avatar is apt at inoculating the right dose of candor and ambiguity, posturing Hayley as the consenting victim of her overage desires. Jeff's avatar ""Lensman319"" makes him the master of pan-optic vision. Obviously aimed at luring girls into believing he is a professional photograph, his pseudo also expresses a clearly voyeuristic impulse. Further onomastic investigation of his real name, teaches us that ""Jeff"" in printing slang, used as an intransitive verb, stands for gambling (""To play or gamble with em quads, throwing them as dice""). He appears as the character who entrusts his life in the hands of chance, whereas Hayley is always a step ahead of him, because she is moving through a world where most of the foreseeable has been calculated. Indeed, she has most of her plan already thought out, unlike the adult who is caught up in his short-sight psychological intrigue, grounded by his immediate impulses. This implicit statement could serve as a commentary on the enslavement of a generation (here, a notion of the adult world at large) to the mechanics of short-term satisfactions (individualistic consumerism, immediate access to one's narcissistic desires through the internet, etc.), leading to the transformation of people into objects or means for private pleasure. One can easily draw analogies here to another film which portrays the ""postmodern"" adolescent, ""We need to talk about Kevin"" (2011). ""Hard Candy"" may not be as brilliant as the latter, but it has a multi-layered approach to the development of characters that pleads for refinement and subtlety. The main figure of the film is based on a recursion effect: the teenager/girl is playing the role of a teenage/girl, incarnating a second-degree character, therefore eminently reflexive (meta-analysis would relate her to the broader phenomenon of the cinema industry's fondness for the woman-child prototype (Ellen page, Natalie Portman, Emma Watson, etc.). Like Kevin, she evades all empathy, all inwardness, losing her adult counterpart in the mirror of his own expectations and certainties. The usual weaknesses of the teenager become his most lethal weapons, rhetorical instruments instead of realities that would usually define him on the brink of loss of innocence: his emotional vulnerability, his versatility, his relative irresponsibility and carelessness. On the other part, the adult appears to be sclerosed in his processes and seems therefore to be an easy target for deconstruction on the part of his younger opponent, like some obsolete functioning system relying on predictable binary logic (slight overstatement to be taken with a grain of salt). The film would welcome a deeper analysis as there are many more symbolic and subtext significance encrypted all through, but this format will not allow for much more. Therefore, to conclude, let's take a look at the end of the movie. The hide and seek game reaches a critical point in the final scene: in compensation for his imminent suicide, Jeff asks Hayley to promise not to talk about his secrets, hoping to save face and preserve his memory untouched in the mind of some adult lover of his. The last twist is her ""or not"" uttered in the very moment when Jeff has already taken the fatal leap off the roof. Her promise only holds up until the moment where the suicide is really consummated. This is why she withdraws during this very brief moment of legal suspension where the act has become irreversible but not quite brought to an end either, signifying otherwise a violation of her parole. She is therefore not immoral. In a certain sense, the post-modern teenager has managed to undermine even the global, determining inertia, of the fairytale's moral, evading the rule of its ritualistic closure. Eluding the possibility for infantile psychologization by the adult world, the adolescent retreats back into a world where he is more than ever the master of its ambiguous languages, means of communication and specular inversion of paternalistic figures.",Hard Candy
395,leniecolacino,"Hey, Make Me Root For The Pedophile!",1,9 March 2012,"Despite the strong performances of the two protagonists this movie is completely unsavory and has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I mean how entertaining and dramatic is it to sit through an interminable castration scene? Not very! What is the point to this movie? Someone please tell me. Is it that no matter what side of the fence you are on, sexual abuse is bad? Ellen Page's character is completely unbelievable as many have noted here (does she ever shut up?). She is a 14 year old girl with the intellect of a super criminal and the physical strength of the Incredible Hulk, overpowering her adult male enemy several times during the film despite her age and double digit weight. How does she know to have her taser in hand at the ready in the ridiculous shower sequence?

Besides having a suspenseful twisting plot the film displays a large plethora of outstanding thematic elements. This first thing I noticed was surprisingly enough the costume design choice for Ellen Page's character (costumes are typically the last thing I care to notice), however I thought that the red hoodie to resemble little red riding hood was fantastic and does quite a bit for the film as a whole. The next thing that caught my attention was the sublime work of Cinematographer Jo Willems, his use of extreme close ups and high and low angle shots place viewers in the exact mood conveyed through-out the film , which of course being unease and complete and utter disgust with a slight tinge of misplaced empathy.

To ""Hard Candy""'s credit, it turns expectations on their head by making it the man who should be afraid of the girl. Unfortunately this is where the film's imagination ends.The film bores through lack of plot development. It's effectively split into two acts. In Act One, Jeff and Hayley meet for a bite to eat and decide to go back to Jeff's place. In Act Two, Hayley decides to drug Jeff and subject him to physical and mental torture. This is far less compelling than it sounds, and was made all the worse by some truly pitiful acting; the change in Hayley's character from sweet fourteen year old to psychotic vigilante, for instance, is highly unbelievable. In the film's favour, however, we have a compelling and discomforting visual style which really is quite unique.Some people will inevitably be taken in by this pile of gunk, hailing it as a challenging and subversive masterpiece which confronts hard-hitting contemporary issues head on.

401,peepzcallmerob,There's nothing sweet about 'Hard Candy',7,11 September 2008,"http://entertainmentblur.wordpress.comA slasher film? Psychological thriller? A twisted fantasy? A wake up call to parents who don't know the power of the Internet and the access it gives to online predators? Yes. All of the above.Hard Candy is David Slade's feature debut and although it's not a great film, it's certainly one that will stir up discussion. This also showcases Ellen Page (who is widely known for the recent Juno) in one of her first starring roles. If your image of Page is that quirky and witty pregnant teenager, then wait to you see her in this.A handsome and slick-talking 32-year-old man named Jeff (Patrick Wilson) talks to a flirtatious, 14-year-old girl named Hayley (Ellen Page, who was 17 at the time) online. They mutually decide to meet at a coffee shop, and then they go back to Jeff's place. Uh oh. I see where this is going, but the thing is that I really didn't.The beginning of the movie is as well made and intriguing as any other great thrillers. We question whether or not the seemingly inevitable will happen, which truly we're hoping won't. But as events fold, we just keep inching closer and closer to something we don't want to see: the adult photographer with the little girl, alone in his home.But then the movie really does something spectacular. As if my innuendos didn't raise awareness that something memorable was about to occur, I cannot continue the plot summary without spoiling the movie.What I can say is how this very low-budget film, consisting of two main characters that are indulged in explicit and overpowering dialogue, was suspenseful from the beginning to end. You find out that Hayley is years younger than what her intelligence shows, though she displays the naivety of youth throughout as well. And Jeff, is he just playing the innocent card just so he can carry on his perverted fantasy, or is it vise versa? Ellen Page and Patrick Wilson give extraordinary performances throughout. The screenplay, written by Brian Nelson, is paced very well and gives this movie all the right turns up to the conclusion. In a time when MySpace has opened doors and new opportunities to pedophiles, Hard Candy is a reminder to all perverts out there that people are always watching.But the question that I was left with once the movie was over was: Who was the victim?

This is truly an unique film from first-time director David Slade.The film centers around Haley(Page) and Jeff(Wilson), who meets up after having been chatting flirtatiously over the internet for the past three weeks. The thing is, Haley is a 14 year old girl and Jeff is a 32 year old photographer. Creepy? It gets worse.After meeting they hit it off, and Haley goes with Jeff to his apartment, where most of the film takes place. I'm going to stop here, in fear of giving anything away. Let's just say you're in for a real roller-coaster ride. I didn't find one dull moment, and was easily pulled into the story, eagerly awaiting what would happen next.Patrick Wilson gives a stunning performance as Jeff, showing of a wide range of subtle emotional shifts, giving the character depth and believability. Even though I know Jeff is up to no good, I did start to feel for him as the film went on, which is impressive to say the least. Ellen Page as the 14 year old Haley is truly a find, pulling off both the innocent and more menacing aspects of her character. She was only 17 during the shooting of this film, and shows a great deal of maturity and understanding of her character and the subject at hand.

403,big_novak,"Wild, compelling, but lacks a clear point and wholly implausible",7,18 April 2006,"Hard Candy is a graphic and gripping film without being overly visceral or inflammatory... well maybe just a little. It forces the audience to examine the gray area between right and wrong, whether or not pedophiles can ever truly be ""rehabilitated"" and what society should do when the justice system becomes ineffective in dealing with sick people who hurt others, especially children.A wild ride...The viewer is constantly tossed back and forth the whole film, wondering who is in the ""right..."" the pedophile or his antagonist. Torture, graphic language, (implied) gore and heart-felt stories of abuse, love lost and sorrow compel the viewer to wonder who is lying, who is committing the crime, and how either character will make it out of the house alive. It's odd to occasionally side with Jeff the pedophile, but as all sociopaths do, he rationalizes his behavior very well, spins intriguing, almost plausible lies and causes you to wonder how easily a single adult male who legitimately photographs under-age girls for a living could be wrongfully accused of abuse. Hayley's character is brilliant (and brilliantly acted by Ellen Page) and in her own way, another sociopath. It's perhaps the first case I've ever seen on film of ""the blind torturing the blind.""What I do like about the film: It is beautifully shot, with vivid colors and tastefully-used camera techniques that highlight the tension and ambiguity of the story. The film avoids being overtly graphic, considering the subject matter covered includes pedophilia, child abuse, child porn, torture and murder. The story itself is not new (the hunter becoming the hunted), but it is presented in a new way that forces the audience into uncomfortable places and (hopefully) constructive discourse on a pressing social issue. Ellen Page is amazing. Watch for her in the future...What I don't like about the film: Overall, it asks quite a lot of the audience in the sense of suspending one's disbelief. As mentioned, the Hayley character is brilliant, but I found it nearly impossible that a (supposed) 14 year old girl - savant or not - could have created such a complicated and nefarious plan to bring Jeff to ""justice."" Also, even though the film goes to strange lengths to show Hayley's extremely fit (muscular and cut) body, it would be IMPOSSIBLE for her to move the unconscious body of a full-grown, 180 pound man, let alone lift him onto a chair or table as she somehow manages to do. Finally, I don't like the sociological stance the film seems to take, that society creates pedophiles. Most of that conjecture comes from learning Jeff's background through his own words (are we supposed to believe a single word from him?) and from info Hayley has gathered on her own, but it creates several disturbing questions: Are pedophiles born or raised? Can being lonely, heartbroken and unable to find love drive a normal human being to depraved, horrific and prurient lows, or were they inherently flawed to begin with? When are people no longer responsible for their actions (when does an illness take over for personal responsibility), and what can ultimately be done to ""rehabilitate"" repeat child molesters? Mostly, I suppose I find it disturbing to humanize pedophiles as I personally feel they are not human.Overall, I liked the film. It was quick. Hayley's dialogue is biting and acerbic, often drawing an uncomfortable laugh from the audience in the midst of a melee of violence and anger. Jeff is a (nearly) likable villain, though the lines between villain and hero become increasingly blurred the farther we go down the rabbit hole. There are moments of raw anger, vengeance and pity. The characters are well-drawn and acted, and you genuinely feel for both of them at different times. When Hayley takes a blow to the stomach, you feel it. When Jeff struggles to break free from his ropes, you squirm with him. The social commentary that the film *should* create is vital to the future of our nation, especially as more and more repeat child molesters are being caught and hundreds of thousands of their victims silently suffer, or disappear altogether, each year.Unfortunately, Hard Candy is heavy-handed and manipulative. It pulls every cinemagraphic/dramatic trick known to man to force the audience down one track, then another, leaving the viewer to feel disoriented and themselves molested (possibly intentionally?). I nearly expected a never-before-seen cat to jump out of the darkness in one scene just to scare the audience. The story is altogether implausible, no matter how much we would like it to be. You'd like to leave the theater thinking, ""Wow, I'm glad the bad guy got what he deserved!"" but you know he didn't, as this is America and the legal system is unable to correctly handle sociopathic pedophiles. Still, go see it. It's a wild, phrenetic ride well worth the ticket price. Think about the characters, their actions and motivations and form your own opinions. Then - most importantly - talk about them.",Hard Candy
404,susannakerr,worth watching,8,2 February 2007,"""Hard Candy"" was an interesting look at the relationship between a pedophile and his victim. I liked watching the answer to the the question....what if the predator becomes the prey? Not to mention the acting was amazing, Ellen Page gave quite a thrilling performance. I think this movie is definitely worth watching; there is just the right amount of suspense. It seems as if there is a fascination with the nature of pedophiles right now, even ""Dateline"" has come out with a special called ""To catch a predator."" The movie questions the character of both the troubled lonely photographer and the intelligent charismatic young girl. ""Hard Candy"" is a new take on the game cat and mouse.",Hard Candy
405,andrewgrant72-1,Hard Candy is a hard movie. Be brave and see it,10,20 January 2007,"If a certain film blows me over, i'll see it again and again, hoping it will inspire others. This is one of those films. I watched it alone, having never heard of it, and within a day or two, watched it again with my sister. I then recommended it to my father. It's the kind of film in which word-of-mouth plays a HUGE part. The only reason I picked it up was because it featured an ANGELS IN America actor and had a few critics blurbs on the front of the box. What this film essentially does is take you on a ride. When we meet our characters, they are flirting online. Then we see them meet up at a coffee shop, (where the young girl educates the adult on the pleasures of ganache). This film takes many different turns. I LOVED that I watched it with NO knowledge of what it was about. And I hope just one reader here will walk into this movie with the same idea. Shame on all the reviewers who want to explain any plot details to the unsuspecting viewer. This movie is best left unexplained.",Hard Candy
406,Superlove999,Worst movie I've seen all year.,1,6 December 2006,"I'd heard from several sources that this movie was great, and the first five-ten minutes had me really intrigued. Unfortunately it was all downhill from there. There was absolutely no character development - I didn't know a damn thing about Jeff or Hayley, so how could I sympathize with either of them? The dialogue was laughable at best - the pretentious ""I'm going to break you down psychologically"" garbage gets really old REALLY quickly. Also, I spent every second after Jeff wakes up tied to the chair wondering when something, anything, was going to happen. Nothing did.Oh yeah, and what exactly was Hayley ""getting revenge"" on him for? He didn't do anything to her. Since when is having photos of models in one's house a castrate-able offense? Stay away from this movie.",Hard Candy

The 2 main actors were intense and believable, impressive considering the extreme situation. The plot development was intensely disturbing but compelling! I never knew what was going to happen next. I understand that Hand Candy is an inexpensive indie movie, so the format was ""a day in the life"", but I really would have loved to have found out how a 14 year old could get so callous, and angry, and how she could be so incredibly thorough. Her ability to play high level mind games on Jeff suggests maturity well beyond what I would expect from a young teenager. Her character rates a movie in its own right. This is the only reason I didn't give 10 stars. Now that I have seen it, I don't need to again. It isn't deep enough to rate repeated viewing. Once blew me away though.Keep your eyes on Ellen Page. She is willing to do daring things very well.",Hard Candy
408,v-v-vinaybabu,This is the most intense and passion-filled that I've watched till date,10,14 March 2008,"This is one the most intense and hard-bitting movies that I've watched till date (and btw I watch a lot of movies)!!! It also discusses the issue of pedophiles who lurk on the internet chat rooms, befriend young girls and s****lly abuse them causing a great deal of grief throughout the affected girl's entire life. If someone would have said to me before that with just two characters and a single location, you could make a film that can make the audience sit on the edge of the seats and stare and stare and stare, I wouldn't have believed it. But this movie proved me wrong.My biggest worry after watching this film is whether I'll ever appreciate other films in the future, because this film sets the bar so, so high. Kudos to the film crew which creates this thriller. Ellen Page gives a performance that's better than even her critically-appreciated 'Juno'. (Clearly this film is the reason that she was asked to play the role of 'Juno' ).The male actor too is superb. You could be forgiven if you don't care to find about the actors in real life, because their performance in this reel-life thriller are very, very good. This movie is definitely in my list of the best films ever made.",Hard Candy
409,bakes5981,Revenge is best served cold... with balls on the side.,10,30 July 2008,"Revenge is best served cold.Ellen Page is phenomenal. In this cold drama of payback and then some, this young ""girl"" packs a punch of serious dramatic skills (sorry I can't out it much better). She's little known in this part of the globe. She may not be remembered anymore as Shadow Cat in ""X-Men: The Last Stand"", but her lead role in ""Juno"" is worth the memory space, as she was nominated for Best Actress in it.Look, Ellen is great! She plays the character of a cynical, apathetic, teenage girl with a psychopathic streak down pat. And I'd like to see her in even more challenging roles  if there were any besides that in Hard Candy. She's so good, it's creepy! And BELIEVABLE! I don't wanna jinx her career by comparing her to any other (read: older) award-winning actresses, but I believe she can make it on he own, in her own terms. She was barely 18 when she played Hayley Stark in Hard Candy, and already she has matured years beyond her age. It's not that she's new to acting having had her first acting gig at the young age of ten, but she has honed her craft really good.Hard Candy is a film to watch not for entertainment, but to behold Ellen and to ""go ahead and worship (her)."" Ellen carries this film so well (although Patrick Wilson is not a pushover himself), she's brilliant! Damn, she's an ""honor student; (n)othing (she) can't do when (she) put(s) (her) mind to it."" Revenge is best served cold. And better maybe with balls on the side.Enough about me blabbering about Ellen already.Hard Candy. Go watch it. Ten out of ten stars!",Hard Candy
410,davidgardiner,A good film that could have been excellent (contains flagged spoilers),7,25 June 2006,"The first thing to say about this is that it begins extremely well. Both Patrick Wilson and (especially) Ellen Page turn in excellent performances and the scenes are edgy and suspenseful. The first two thirds are right up there with Psycho and Misery and the recent Hostel. I was (to drag out the old cliché) on the edge of my seat. But in the final half hour, for me at least, the whole thing began to break up, and unnecessary plot complications and sermonising seemed to take over from what had been a straight and very fine gut-wrencher.The most glaringly unsuccessful scene was the visit from the (Korean or Chinese origin?) neighbour, whose standard of acting would not have been out of place in a porn film. This was so unconvincing and, frankly, botched that my willing suspension of disbelief failed me, and I started finding fault with other plot elements too. The last half hour of the film called up images of the production team sitting around and saying things like ""We've only got sixty-three minutes. How could we fill up another twenty-six?"". Pointless red-herrings and plot convolutions seemed to be dragged-in, and the supposed fourteen-year-old started making speeches that sounded like passages from ""Sociology Today"".(SPOILERS TO FOLLOW) It would have been so much better to leave Jeff's guilt or innocence unclear and ambiguous, keep Haley in character as the seemingly deranged teenager, and build up to a claustrophobic psychological battle of wills in which she either mutilates or kills him for real or he finds a way out. In the end the writer's nerve seems to fail him, and he tries to make this highly uncomfortable and challenging material more palatable and acceptable, and more in tune with the spirit of the times. The moral ambiguities are ironed out and Jeff becomes a child-murderer or someone complicit in that crime and she a campaigning vigilante who doesn't physically hurt anyone but simply talks Jeff into committing suicide in order to preserve his untarnished image with his former girlfriend. Believable or what? Perhaps it should be said that it took a brave production company to tackle this kind of material at all. Misunderstanding and controversy and allegations of political incorrectness were bound to ensue (one has only to glance at the message boards here). But the regrettable thing for me was that they lacked the conviction to carry through on what was in fact a very promising and original horror film theme.",Hard Candy
411,mostlyxharmless,Intense! 10 out of 10!!,10,1 December 2006,"There are some movies you watch while laying on the couch half dozing. There are others that beckon you attention so you sit up and attentively watch. Then there is Hard Candy where you find yourself sitting, a foot away from your TV, clawing the carpet in anticipation as you find yourself transported into a world of monsters that do not hide under your bed at night, but in the car right next to you.The story begins in a chat room, where a 31 year old man seduces a young, 14 year old girl. The fear of every parent is realized as the young lady agrees to meet with the photographer at a local coffee shop. Wearing the red hood of a young and defenseless girl, our heroine Hayley meets the charming photographer Jeff, but her innocence is her mask, as we find out when the two retreat back to Jeff's lair. ""Playtime is over,"" as she drugs him and ties him into a chair. Torcher ensues as Hayley tries to uncover the mystery of a missing girl. Not everything in this film is as it seems.With much more in common with an Asian film, first time director Danny Slate, defies normal Hollywood convention and creates a ballet of tension, and for whom the music is fear. The film moves very still and stealth-like. The only sudden jerks of the camera are to display confusion and the action of a scene. The lack of a soundtrack emphasizes the characters themselves, forcing you to watch their eyes and every movement to try to clue you in to their true motives. The excellent usage of different lighting and color give tight, tense shots, extra power and more insight into our character's heads. Hitchcock would be proud of a script by playwright and television scribe Brian Nelson, as it weaves its way in and out of a horrific tale in which at times, you're not sure with character to be frightened of: The creepy child molester, or his vigilante punisher.You may recognize the budding young starlet, Ellen Page from her blink and you'll miss her role as Kitty Pryde in X-Men 3. In this she lets loose her acting chops and shows an uncharacteristic range from such a young actress. Page was only 17 when filming this controversial film, yet she shows a range that many Hollywood actresses twice her age could not reach. It's not her character's anger that inspires, but her the vulnerability she displays this very multi-sided character. She is so superb and mesmerizing, that it sometimes shocks you that when you realize just how scary her character is. She takes her character to a place where you do not only just root for Hayley, but you also fear her and her mission.Patrick Wilson may look vaguely familiar, as I felt he looked like Will Arnet from Fox's Arrested Development, but instead he stared in the mediocre Phantom of the Opera musical. In this film he is let loose in this film. He has this ability to make you sincerely feel sorrow for a person you should only loath and detest While most of the film he was tied up, he had the hardest role of them all. His role in the film is not physical, so he has to truly push himself and his psyche to the limit. His character's vulnerability is what truly makes this film worthwhile. If you had simply just an evil, vile man, and a young girl who wanted to kill him, there would be no film, but the layers he gave the pedophile photographer Jeff, gave the film a feeling all his own. You didn't root for his character, but you don't necessarily want to see this charming man killed off either.I have never seen another movie quite like this. The power and intensity felt, was mesmerizing. The multifaceted movements in this film, from each character were so subtle and surprising, as well as intoxicating. The time flew as the film went on. I felt sick at times, and elated at others. This is the best non-horror genre horror film I have seen in years. The industry could learn from the neat and precise way the horrors of this meeting that took place. Rarely have I ever had another experience like this, and not quite like the feelings I felt when watching Requiem for a Dream, but that's about the closest comparison for the feelings and emotions elated when watching this opus of American film-making. Watching a film such as this excites me to the prospects of the future and reminds me of something Francis Ford Coppola once said that the greatest movie of all was yet to be made. That something else could be done and more could be accomplished. After finishing the ride that was Hard Candy, I think we are reaching that point more and more everyday, than I once believed, and it makes me smile.",Hard Candy
412,naderq-1,The plot is simply not logical,5,18 September 2007,"Why would a wicked pedophile who has probably killed a girl be so much afraid of letting her ex-girlfriend know about a little girl on his ROOF? Why would she tell him that she knew about the other murderer just at the end? Why didn't she make him confess when she could much more easily do that, than wait and make this redundant long psychological fight? The issue I think is that the director goes on the plot he likes but at the end he needs to justify all the girls seemingly cruel actions. So suddenly the girl becomes the hero of a previous un-seen movie (like Rambo II) and tells him she has already sent the other murderer to hell! I think directors can observe logic and still make a good film so I guess 5 out of 10 is very fair.",Hard Candy
413,callumthebeast,Hard Candy review,8,3 March 2012,"Hard candy is a thriller staring Ellen Page and Patrick Wilson. Hard candy follows the story of a young 14 year old girl (Page) who gets to know this elder man (Wilson) over the internet. They decide to meet up and eventually go back to the mans apartment where things take a dramatic unpredictable turn.Before I watched the film I had no idea what it was about, I hadn't even seen the trailer, or read any other reviews.This was just as well, as by the end this film had me on the edge of my seat. This film is punchy, exciting and most important of all meaningful. The Director (David Slade) shoots the film in such a way that n by the end of the film your rooting for the 'bad guy', which almost makes you question your own conscious. The film is quite hard to watch at points, (without giving too much away) Ellen Page's character is a tad and she (suggestively) commits gruesome acts. This only adds to the strong story and even sparks some questions about the girl. Who is she? Why is she doing this? I even came to one conclusion that the girl could be representing the mans sub- conscious and that she may not even be real. What this film does is realistically depict the sub-conscious of a paedophile, and it does this brilliantly. Yes it does this in a dramatic and at times 'over the top' way. The film still sticks with you long after you've seen it.Calum.Russell",Hard Candy
414,abdel411,"Preachy, but excellent acting",6,8 November 2006,"Good news: Great acting. Excellent dialogue. Challenging subject matter Bad news: Do we still need to be told that child molestation is bad? I felt that most of the movie was just too preachy, and felt more like an R rated PSA. The script was structured in a weird way as well, flipping traditional protagonist and antagonist roles, at least in a way that was weird to me (You'd have to see the film to see what I mean). But on the plus side, the actors were able to keep up beautifully with the intense dialogue and content matter. It is truly amazing to watch these two carry the whole movie by themselves. Bottom line, I wasn't looking for a lesson in morals, I thought the script was poorly structured, but otherwise, truly worth the watch",Hard Candy
415,Khaderach19,loved it,10,5 May 2006,"I'm not going to rehash the plot. You can read that in other peoples posts.All I'd like to say is that the two-person thriller has some of the best psychological play in a long time. There hasn't been a movie since, well ever, that your torn between who to side with. Are you for Page's character or Wilson? Is this act justified or is it cruel and unusual punishment? In the end your almost left with a bad taste in your mouth of how it all went down. But days later your still thinking about those images (well mostly haunted about the scene with the scalpel).As for the presentation, David Slade almost has an ""Aronofsky-esque"" touch to the scene. The changing colors, from hues of blue, red and white to make the audience feel what Wilson's character is feeling during his interrogation.Good work overall, albeit nearly impossible to happen in real life.

Unfortunately, the screenwriter failed to edit the dialogue down to a point where we have a chance to think for ourselves.The main difference between a film and a radio show, is you can see everything that's going on. We never get to feel what these characters are feeling, because they are too busy regurgitating anti-pedophilia rhetoric. Unnecessary rhetoric that actually distracts from the rapidly disintegrating storyline.What we need are less reasons to feel sorry for the Jeff, the pedophile and more reasons to understand where the ""victim"" is coming from. By the time we do, it really is too late. It seems the director knows the timing is bad, and thus provides us with even less clues then we needed.",Hard Candy

Innocent...).Turns around the usual roles of man-kills-woman, man-chases-woman, and makes this into a movie where a woman (girl, really) is the protagonist, a clever little thing with a mission she's determined to carry through.Dark.

420,akillmzeier,worth seeing,7,12 October 2005,"I just screened this film at LGF last night. I was quite intrigued for the first forty minutes. Then it all kind of fell apart for me. In it's best moments this film explores the complexities of vengeance and psychology. It tries to be clever by pulling a role reversal -- but this eventually wears thin and the dialog becomes didactic and contrived. I still think it is worth seeing for the strength of the leads alone. Patrick Wilson does a fine job as a ""suspected"" pedophile. He elicits both sympathy and disgust. Ellen Page as the young girl is absolutely fantastic. Her performance is brilliant and even frightening at times. She's good even when the script can't match her talent. I look forward to seeing her in many films to come. Finally a young actress who is more than just a pretty face -- I'm so tired of the Natalie Portmans, the Hillary Duffs, and the Jessica Albas of the world. Good luck with your career Ms. Page.All in all, Hard Candy is worth seeing. Maybe I'm just a sucker for movies with tiny casts and realtime pacing. But there are some genuinely suspenseful moments in the film, although in the hands of lesser actors these scenes would disintegrate. And though I was annoyed by the contrivances and implausibilities of the script, I found myself the next day thinking about some of the issues raised therein.At times Hard Candy reminded me of Polanski's Death and the Maiden, though H.C. is nowhere near as good. Ellen Page's Haley character is similar to Sigourney Weaver's character in the Polanski film. Both women are terrifying through the cold precision of their revenge. The problem with the Haley character is that she would have to be supernatural to accomplish the things she does in this film. And of course if she was supernatural, we'd have a completely different film on our hands -- High Plains Drifter.",Hard Candy

422,sillypuzzle,This movie sends the wrong message,4,24 November 2017,"The rating listed here is mighty generous in my honest opinion. I didn't care too much for how this story was put together. It seemed like it came from a person with many issues regarding men. In today's world of massive sexual assault accusations this kind of flick is the kind of thing that adds fuel to a fire that's already out of control.I realize that I'm more than late with this review so I'll cut to the chase. The story is not believable where a grown man can't get lose from a knot tied by a little girl who supposed to have the personality of a woman who has lived the life of a hooker in her forties. What 32 year old man is going to lay that still while someone cuts off his testicles? OK so yes I realize that a person should have the ability to stretch the imagination a bit so that their mind can accept these things as a reality.I like the acting job done by Patrick Wilson and Ellen Page because lord knows they had to work hard to try and make this as believable as possible. Sandra Oh had the miserable job of playing Judy Tokuda, the nosy neighbor that is too dumb to see what is going on. She wasn't right for this part and you could see that on her face with each one of her inept parts.There are much better selections than this one to chose from when your scrolling through your favorite movie platforms. The ending really was flawed. I couldn't figure out why in the world would he succumb to the antics of a 14 year old twisted in the head little girl while I watched him jump off the roof of his own house with the noose around his neck if he was so innocent and I actually believed he was telling the truth. Before it goes off it shows her walking away with the red hoody on like she was little red riding hood. What a buzz kill!",Hard Candy
423,cads-2,Disturbing but I got through it!,8,14 December 2006,"This film played with my mind more than any other I have seen in a long time. The basic premise is that Hayley a 14 yr old girl gets groomed online by a 32 year old photographer called Jeff. She invites herself back to his flat and then proceeds to drug and torture the fella until he admits that he is a paedophile.I have to admit that it has taken me a good 45 mins after watching it, to work out what I thought of this film. It disturbed me, played with my emotions and my sense of horror all the time it was on. From the very start I was appalled at the actions of Jeff in grooming the young girl. It had me feeling uneasy and disgusted from the start. As the film went on though I found my horror at the young girl was just as bad! All throughout the film it attempts to make you feel sympathy for someone that hasn't admitted to any wrong doing, and a lot of people on this site are pointing out that during certain scenes they feel sympathy with the character. Making the audience think like this is exactly what the director intended. The way that it has suckered people in during the castration scene when he denies that he is a molester so that they feel sympathy for him is testament to the great writing, direction and acting in this film. From the start of this film you know that Jeff is a bad a man, yet the film makes him out to be the victim right the way through. No matter which way you look at it he is the worst kind of person! It asks questions of you, like whether Jeff deserves what is happening to him, and these are really hard to work out, esp while watching the film when all you can concentrate on is the horror on the screen. I keep using the word horror because it is the one word that my mind keeps focusing on when I think about the aspects of this film. I know that the castration scene will live in my memory as much as the hobbling scene in misery! It is definitely worth a watch just so that you can experience the emotional roller-coaster I feel that I went through. I can't help but think that those people that found themselves feeling sympathy for Jeff, really have to ask themselves some hard questions. Unlike many on here I found the writing to be excellent and the acting to be some of the finest I have seen.",Hard Candy
424,mary-bettini,great cast,8,11 April 2007,For only having two main characters this film works really well. It is almost like a really intense play because it takes place mostly in the same place and both characters go through extreme feeling and arches through out the film. Ellen Page did an amazing job of balancing innocence and fierceness. She was so convincing. She really is an amazing actress. I definitely think we will be seeing more of her around Hollywood. The guy who played the male was great as well he did a good job of slipping in and out of control. The chemistry between the two and the solidness of the script really made this movie great in my opinion. It took a rather racy subject matter and put a creative interesting twist on it.

It makes it sort of - well- like listening to an annoying little brat for the duration of a whole movie.If the girl really wanted to torture the poor bloke, all she had to do was play this movie to him.While watching it, I thought to myself, ""This script was probably written by some woman who was dumped by her man and then decided to make this movie about a guy being tortured to get back at the male gender.""

Page is one of those 16-year-olds with the brain of a 40 year old but the perceptions of a young person. She doesn't miss a trick. One of the most disturbing things about the film is the shifting sympathy you feel for the murderous juvenile delinquent and the even more murderous child molesting predator. It is claustrophobicly set in a few rooms of a small house, filmed at a relatively great distance with a shallow depth of field so the characters appear to be in an isolated field of focus between fuzzy foreground and fuzzy background. It makes the action seem dreamlike. It has its funny moments, too. Walking past the paralyzed man trying to crawl down the hall, the young girl casually zaps him with a Taser to make him stop. It's right out of a Bugs Bunny cartoon. I hoped she was castrating the bastard. I was a little disappointed to find out she hadn't. But she had more in store. It's full of levels and depths and things with double meanings. I really enjoyed this film even when it made me cringe--especially when it made me cringe. Keep your eye on Ellen Page--you're going to see a lot of her in the coming years.",Hard Candy

Though it's supposed to be a thriller, but boy, it's the coolest show I've watched this year so far and it casted all my glooms away.It was surprising to find out that there were only 5 main actor/actresses in the show but yet the movie was so tastefully put together and two-thumbs-up + two-toes-up for Ellen Page who've developed such a skill in acting. Though this time she didn't walk through any walls (like how she did in X-men 3) but she definitely walked through my mind with deep impressions.Till the end of the show, I could only be awed by the script, storyline, simple settings and Ellen Page's acting.Sometimes, something simple can be profound too.

430,LLRusty,Worse than a punch in the face,1,25 February 2009,"Watching this attempt at film making has to rank as one of the worst moments of my movie watching life. The only thing I can recommend about it is the first ten minutes which feature some well done tension. What follows in the next hour is nothing short of torture porn, with two extremely unlikeable characters (Hayley and Jeff) physically and verbally abusing each other. One is unlikeable because of overacting and script and the other by his apparent guilt.The fact that evidence of Jeff's guilt is sketchy for most of the film makes the whole experience even worse. By the time the film gives you some proof it's too late to feel any sympathy towards Hayley. You're then left with deciding who to hate more as it is impossible to identify with either.I can't root for a psychotic teenager who taunts and tortures people, even though I feel I'm meant to. The fact that Hayley clearly has no apparent motive, or attachment to Jeff or the girl he supposedly molested, does not help her case. So here you're left with a revenge story that doesn't work and a choice of 2 protagonists: paedophile or psycho.The film also has a grainy feel to it which just makes it look cheap and dated, and there is some horrible editing with the camera disappearing behind objects before jumping back sometimes after the screen has turned bright red. This is probably meant to be artistic but it looks crap.There really is no reason to watch this monstrosity, unless you're a movie masochist, or one of those people that thinks Controversial subject = good film. One thing's for sure, this film is about as far from good as you can get.",Hard Candy
431,snoopdavidniven,Chi-chi Claptrap,1,31 July 2008,"Predictably overpraised torture-swill that I watched on a pay-cable outlet that, honest to God, followed their airing of this film with SAW III, and then KINKY SEX CLUB (one of those faceless soft-core porn films they run in late night time-slots)! An unfortunate anomaly of programming, you say? Business as usual, says I. Though HARD CANDY depends upon the illusion of offering acerbic social commentary, its only value as cultural document is as a prosecution exhibit establishing the media's eager complicity in the continuing collapse of Western civilization - and that includes the critics. (Speaking of whom, I wonder how unanimous their praise would have been had this film been about a 14-year-old BOY taunting and tormenting an adult male pedophile attempting to seduce him? Ahh, but Hollywood doesn't like to dwell on the preponderance of homosexual pedophiles in the headlines they exploit for popular consumption. That sort of thing's bad for the overall agenda.) If you're still burbling pop-sociology phrases like 'grrrl power' and 'subversive gender/power reversal', adamant that HARD CANDY is provocative and powerful and that new standby for exploitative junk, 'darkly witty', try this simple test. Mentally subtract all the high-tech 21st century tchotchkes from the scenario - the cell phones and lap tops and such - and give HARD CANDY a 1930s, art-deco production design. Set it in Weimar Germany, and make it the tale of a worldly, predatory, pedophilic Jew getting his deserved comeuppance at the hands of a plucky, self-reliant Aryan maiden of 14. Voila!

433,Yakisoba,'Torture porn' is a lazy label . . .,7,19 March 2008,"The infamous premise of Hard Candy is well known: a 14-year-old girl ensnares a sexual predator and proceeds, in the name of justice, to torture him physically and psychologically for his crimes. This premise has understandably rubbed a lot of people the wrong way, and has led a great number of professional critics to dismiss the film as exploitive pulp. But to condemn Hard Candy as nothing but ""torture porn,"" I think, is to grossly oversimplify a difficult issue.Watching torture is unpleasant, yes, but Saving Private Ryan, a critically lauded film, is also unpleasant to watch. What, on a purely moral level, separates Saving Private Ryan from Hard Candy? What elevates one film to art, and reduces the other to exploitation? Many people would argue that ""meaning"" is what separates the two. But how, exactly, do you define ""meaning""? Did Sin City (which also deals with torture and is infinitely more gruesome than Hard Candy) have a ""meaning""? If not, why did most critics like that? Because the brutality was more stylized? If so, to what extent can stylization justify unpleasant subject matter? And if it can, does that mean stylization is equitable with art? What is art, anyway? I won't pretend that I have answers to all of these questions. But through them, I think I've proved that to dismiss Hard Candy as nothing but exploitation is intellectually lazy, and very probably hypocritical. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle, in a particularly idiotic case of critical hypocrisy, calls Hard Candy a ""wallow in ugliness"" with ""no point,"" while praising Sin City for its ""entertainment value,"" despite noting directly in his review that it's a pointless exercise. Apparently a faked castration that occurs entirely off-screen is more ""ugly"" to him than a real one shown in graphic detail (also, curiously enough, performed on a pedophile). This isn't at all a condemnation of Sin City, mind you, but a condemnation of Mick LaSalle and the many other critics who engage in this kind of intellectual hypocrisy.Viewed objectively, without any particular moral basis, Hard Candy is a tautly directed, brilliantly acted, and generally effective psychological thriller unfortunately hampered with a contrived plot that is unable to find a satisfying conclusion. It is not a great film, but the gripping performances and crackling dialogue keep the enterprise from ever derailing entirely, and elevate what could have been a sensationalist attempt at rejuvenating the thriller genre into something memorable.Whether or not the film is morally wrong in its depiction of torture is up to each individual. I personally found that the viciously funny dialogue and extraordinary performances justified the subject matter, and while it is very possible that some people will disagree with this assessment, I can live with that. As long as they don't turn around and praise Sin City.",Hard Candy
434,vervorfervor2,"An Interesting Look at ""Crime and Punishment""",10,29 June 2007,"When a friend recommended this movie, I shrugged and told her I would watch it. Though I have watched only a few of the hundreds of movies she has recommended, I did take time to watch ""Hard Candy"" after reading it's IMDb summary, and I was not disappointed at all. Though the film crosses into the grotesque, it elicits questions about the morality of justice--both formal and vigilante--and the price we all pay when our most personal beliefs are tested. Haylie's deceptive innocence at the beginning of the film sets the tone for the entire story that really causes the viewer to question the ironic character portrayals. Haylie, who is portrayed in a somewhat negative light, evokes responses ranging from admiration to disgust--as evidenced by comments on this site; viewers also react to Jeff with specimens derived from the same emotional spectrum. A common question seems to be, ""Who is the real monster?"" While the views on this topic are quite controversial, I believe the goal of the movie was to provoke this dialog--but perhaps not externally. What is crime? What is justice? When is punishment just or unjust? Who should deliver justice or punishment? Personally, I thought Jeff was absolute scum, and I liked Haylie because of her intelligence and her sense of justice. But this begs another question: ""Is revenge ever justified?"" Obviously, such a sick crime as pedophilia--here defined as the rape of children--cannot be treated delicately. And this is exactly why the film explores traditional American values and asks us, ""How can you reconcile your beliefs with the realities and truths portrayed here?"" Any attempt at nicety would defeat the purpose of the movie. As it is, the film poses several interesting questions and dares us to reexamine our most personal beliefs.Personally, I thought Jeff got what he deserved. The choice to commit suicide is a luxury compared to what his victims--especially the deceased Donna--endured. Does this justify Haylie's arguably psychopathic quest for revenge? Such an open question is best suited to open-minded people.",Hard Candy

Sorry, but the trend toward 'torture porn' is not a good sign for film-making or the human race in general. There is something inherently perverse about making a film that's supposed to be a revenge flick depicting a pedophiliac's comeuppance -- but at the hand of a child. It's not possible for the film to be 'enlightening', since most of us already understand that sex with minors is a crime. We already understand that people have been damaged by being taken advantage of sexually at a very young age. We already know all of this. The film teaches us nothing about pedophiliacs or the suffering they cause. So the only reason to make this film is for shock value and profit, which is a polluted endeavor at best.

Its great to see the ""potential victim"" become the mastermind. I love films when the teens or the kids set out to show the adults whose in power.

439,grampa1956,The title doesn't prepare you for this fine movie!,9,6 April 2017,"When I first watched this film, I had no expectations so I was caught totally by surprise on how suspenseful and dark ""Hard Candy"" was.Ellen Page and Patrick Wilson were perfect picks for what is basically a two person psycho-drama. Page comes across, at first, as a pretty and naive youngster and Wilson portrays his usual pleasant male lead but the dark undertones kick in quite early. The fact that a teen and an adult agree to meet over the Internet is your first clue that something's amiss. Supposedly, his aim is to only take pictures, being a professional photographer.Wilson's character has made a grave mistake: behind Pages freckles and pretty smile lies a stone-cold stalker.After tricking him into allowing her to make some alcoholic drinks (and drugging him), Page then ties him up and announces her plans: she's going to get him to admit to being a sexual predator and castrate him.The tension escalates from there. The photographer nearly escapes twice but the girl seemingly has come prepared for almost anything.The main reason for Page's character's actions is she believes her captive is the killer responsible for a missing friend of hers.The best thing about the movie is the back and forth dialogue between the two characters (a good script here!).the one thing I've noticed on other sites with reviews is that a lot of people see the teen as insane and that's she got the wrong guy. I believe this is because Patrick Wilson almost always comes across as a hero/nice guy in his films.

440,paul-everitt,To hard to pigeon hole - misses the mark widely,3,20 September 2006,"Marketed by local cinemas under a Lolita campaign this movie could not have been more confronting for the typical euro-cinema fan. There is nothing sensual or humane in this movie, so if you are interested in personal interaction between a mature male and underage girl, stay away. What strikes me about this movie is the ridiculous premise, artless script and inconsistency of the cinematography. The opening 20 minutes of the movie is well shot with modern MTV-like camera work, excellent photography and style to burn, yet the subject matter is disconcerting, providing an excellent counterpoint as you search yourself for feelings to combat what you expect to see next.So what is next? A complete unraveling of the subject matter and descent into the diary of a vigilante. The role of Hayley is seething with a soulless hatred that does nothing to expose or challenge the underlying problem of pedophilia. Why understand something when you can destroy it? The cinematography also descends; into a series of recycled techniques and clumsy metaphors for the violence of the perpetrator and resilience of the victim. This tedium starts to wear the viewers patience.But the clincher for my personal dislike comes not from ""The Woodsman""-like unsettling subject material or the ""Dirty Harry"" raw revenge wearisome, but from the underlying support for lynching/capitol punishment. The righteous stance of the perpetrator might go well in the modern ""war against terror"" age. But persecution, war or capitol punishment have never defeated their respective enemies, only driven them to ground to recommence when opportunity presents.No story. No art. No entertainment.

And the final scenes are a little cracked in rhythm and motivation, to my mind. But the performances are astounding, the art direction and camera work and lighting are perfect. The extras on the DVD are good, too. The actors' commentary not bad, the director's commentary excellent, the featurettes top-notch.

443,scottevil76,Wilson give a career making performance,8,3 December 2006,"A good looking 30 something photographer named Jeff (Patrick Wilson) meets a young teenage girl named Haley (Ellen Page) in a café after weeks of chatting on online sex web sites. She then agrees to accompany him back to his house. Within the time she pours Jeff a drink she drugs him. Jeff wakes up to find that she has bound him to a chair. This man is a dangerous pedophile who loves the company of very young girls and Haley has set out to teach this man a lesson. Haley's character represents every child who has been victim to pedophilia and it is up to her to punish this man who in whole represents every pedophile that has ever molested a child. This is the intriguing premise for David Slade's new film Hard Candy that was released earlier this year. What Slade proposes is a very interesting premise of role reversal. This so called innocent girl has turned the tables on the big bad wolf. Although it is very far fetched what makes this film work is that it's effectively done by the two lead actors Ellen Page and Patrick Wilson. Ellen Page commands the screen as Haley. She tells the tied up Jeff, ""Well, 4 out of 5 doctors agree that I am actually insane."" And there is probably a lot of truth to that because Page plays Haley like a mental patient off her meds. This difficult role seems to come very naturally to Page and she plays her character wise beyond her years. Haley plays mind games with Jeff throughout the 2nd act and one couldn't help but to feel sorry for Jeff. Which leads to the performance of Patrick Wilson. Wilson's performance isn't overshadowed by Paige's. Wilson is given the harder role in the film which is playing a pedophile. Playing a pedophile is such a touchy role for an actor to play because it entitles them to dig deep inside of themselves. It takes a lot of skill as an actor to pull off such as role as Wilson does in this film. I didn't get the intention that Wilson approached his character as a pedophile. Wilson portrays this guy with humanity and what loneliness can do to someone. Some viewers, like myself, may find themselves feeling sorry for this man as he is being toured for his bad deeds. This is the irony that makes this film so remarkably disturbing. Wilson's performances reminds me of a few other gutsy performances in which the actors gives humanity to very unlikable characters, such as Kevin Bacon in The Woodsman and Malcolm McDowell in A Clockwork Orange. I have a feeling that Patrick Wilson will be the next big thing in Hollywood. He has the looks of a young Paul Newman and has a lot of range for an actor. His previous work is many off Broadway plays and a small but memorable role in the HBO miniseries Angels in America. Wilson's upcoming role in a new film called Little Children is the polar opposite of his character in Hard Candy, so I'm looking forward to see him in a very different role. Hard Candy is above all a film that has a quality that is normally not found in very many films today, which is edge. It's also a film that has a very disturbing and ironic quality about it. Both of the performances are executed with brilliance and they will stick with you long after the viewing.",Hard Candy

446,groovylicious_dude,"Snappy, taut and seriously good",8,21 May 2007,"Drawing on talky post-modern teen flicks, showy art house pics and the best of old school horror in a scene that utilises sound to similar chilling effect as the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Hard Candy asserts itself as a surprising slice of high octane entertainment. With its story of revenge and retribution, moments of shocking brutality and bleak gallows humour, it provides a much-needed shot of adrenaline to a lifeless season of summer blockbusters.Building his feature debut like a nastier, amped-up Red Eye, director Slade adopts the minimalistic approach, focusing on the verbal and psychological warfare of his two leads. Raw visuals ratchet up the tension, taut camera-work training the lens on character faces with claustrophobic closeness. We see every expression as it surfaces and fades, every glint of eye and sneer of lip.Casting of little known actors comes as a masterstroke; there's no star baggage here. Wilson proves initially charming and likable, but it is young Ellen Page who really impresses with a mature performance that all but makes the film. She imbues Hayley with wit, edge and attitude - little red riding hood packing mace. The screen positively crackles with heat and hostility. So while Ms. Jovovich and Ms. Berry perfect their fancy fighting acrobatics, here Ms. Page gets down to the gritty reality of the female fight in the modern world. Comparisons with Jodie Foster are obvious, and fitting. Exhilarating, breathless and tragic, Hard Candy will be the most talked-about film of 2006.",Hard Candy
447,laserprinterfeatures,an immoral film,3,17 November 2006,"The only reason I don't give this a 1 is because it does have some nice cinematography and visuals and to some extent maybe even performances, but it's hard to really even judge at that level because this movie is just downright immoral.Don't get me wrong. I don't support censorship. I'm not a member of the Religious Right. I like the avant garde, artistic, unusual, and even violent, but this movie is immoral for the following reason...It condones torture and seeks to engender support from its viewer. The bottom line is THIS GUY DIDN'T DESERVE THIS AND NEITHER DOES ANYONE ELSE. It doesn't matter what he did, TORTURE IS NEVER NEVER NEVER JUSTIFIED. Yes he deserves to go to jail but even torture does not deserve torture as a response, and making that judgment is the only way to stop the cycle of violence in the world today. Now I'm not so naive that I expect a world can ever exist completely without violence, but it is the job of each individual with a concern for bettering themselves and treating others with respect to work to diminish the violence around them and the drive to commit violent acts in others.This movie is sick in the way that The Triumph of the Will is scary, or Jud Süß is disturbing - because we can actually see the director making a deranged judgment without irony, and without concern that he is necessarily making his viewers as morally void as the subjects they are compelled to believe are deserving of torture.So the next time you hear someone say something like, ""That guy deserves to have his balls stomped on (insert other torturous act here),"" let them know that they are the very reason that guys like that exist in this world.",Hard Candy

There aren't many topics that shock as much as pedophilia and with a dose of teenage-girl vigilantism and torture thrown in, you're left with something that certainly shakes up the audience.

449,duvallpj,Don't break your teeth...,7,27 November 2006,"Hard Candy is, at its heart, a simple and straight forward film. The premise is easily summarised; what if a child decided to take revenge on a paedophile? Yet if the concept is simple, in the hands of first time director David Slade, the morality of the film is not.Certainly it is clear from the outset that Patrick Wilson's Jeff is not to be trusted; we all know that a 32 year old photographer who hooks up with fourteen year old girls on the internet is probably not the ideal companion for an impressionable young girl. And yet he is never presented in a truly monstrous light. Throughout the course of the film we discover that he has done terrible things, yet we are never really told what these things were. Such lurid details are left to our own imaginations, and in a world where we are increasingly conscious of the threat of such individuals (particularly with the rise of the internet), we are aware of the possibilities, and it is altogether more unsettling to leave such details unspoken.Wilson succeeds in creating a character who, while he may not be exactly sympathetic (Ellen Page's Hayley, the titular 'Hard Candy', ensures that any excuse or recourse he may have is instantly dismissed as woefully inadequate in trying to justify such crimes), he does portray a realistically desperate man, unable to face his own failures in life, and trying to defend himself against the tirade of accusations thrown at him by his intended victim.The film rests heavily upon the shoulders of these two actors. The other speaking parts can be counted on one hand and occupy a mere fraction of the film's runtime. Wilson is effective in his role, creating a well rounded character, struggling to cope with his terrible flaw, but never degenerating into caricature. But the film succeeds thanks largely to Page's scarily cool and ruthless performance. She is convincing in both stages of portrayal of Hayley; first, as she sets the trap for Jeff, she is innocent and slightly flirty, and then later, hardened to all Jeff's pleas and promises, and determined to start what she has finished. Page's performance stands out in the film, at once powerful and yet fragile, convincingly innocent and yet aware of the brutality of the world.This is perhaps the only major flaw in the film; that Hayley, at the tender age of fourteen, could have the strength of character and the desire to exact such revenge. We never learn about her history. Everything she tells Jeff is (probably) a lie, and even he, frustrated with the mystery surrounding his captor, asks her, 'who are you?' She is more of a vengeful crime fighter, whose origins are unknown, instilling fear into the hearts of paedophiles everywhere.Her personal history is not necessarily that important, since she is more of a representation of all the victims of such men. I found it a little strange that she never really pushes Jeff to explain himself. She refuses to accept that there may be psychological reasons behind his desires, and the revelation of an incident in his childhood which may go some way to explaining his actions is immediately dismissed by Hayley. She only pushes him for the truth regarding his actions. Once she succeeds at this, all that remains is for him to accept responsibility and the repercussions.",Hard Candy

But I must say, I was pleasantly surprised.I won't go into the plot, as I would like the viewers to be as blown away by this as I was. However, one thing I must say that struck me, was the cinematography. It was excellent. I am into some photography, and the shots chosen for the film are as photographically perfect as it gets. Most of it is indoors, so light color and exposure played a major part.And it brings out an awesome effect. The last movie I saw which had such perfect shots was Mulholland Drive and maybe Elephant.About the plot, it does shock you, but IMHO it is a bit far fetched. A 14 year old girl who says things like ""Hayley"" does when she first meets ""Jeff"" would instantly come across as too mature and is really not very authentic. I, found her precocious. But, the girl who plays ""Hayley"" is simply superb.I would definitely recommend this movie, at least for the cinematography, if not the plot.",Hard Candy
451,lkin,Clever Provocative Masterpiece,8,16 November 2006,"This movie blew me away, the contextual elements, the plot and characters. A beautifully well acted Ellen Page did her job well by playing this troubled ""isane"" girl. The story and scenes are constructed well , it isn't one of those movies that is very slow to pick up pace. The setting of the photographer's house also did justice to this movie. Some scenes are very intense, especially one scene hint ""gastration"" really made me cringe in my seat. This is movie for all viewers who like to be questioned, the movie has so many questions to be answered especially at the end. A good movie to watch , it certainly lived up to my expectations",Hard Candy
452,robertoiisuarez,Very deceiving rating,1,29 September 2018,I was foolish enough to believe that the movie has full of suspense. Just Imagine that a grown man over six feet tall was always being out powered by a 14 year old girl. The story is getting nowhere. the filmmakers made a movie just for the heck of it. Make a movie and capitalize on the castration aspect.,Hard Candy
453,Luminelle212,Amazing performances,8,20 April 2006,"I saw Hard Candy at the Angelika, in Tribeca New York and never have I been so shocked, surprised and utterly impressed with an acting performance. The storyline, though somewhat confusing was overpowered by the Oscar-winning performance given by Ellen Page, 14-year old Hayley. Though it could have wrapped up a little sooner (it was a bit longer than expected) I would highly recommend this to anyone who has buddies they talk to online, or anyone that generally enjoys suspenseful films. Not to be outdone by the young star, Patrick Wilson gave an excellent performance. The whole movie was a twisted roller coaster of not knowing who to believe. Whether young Hayley was telling the truth, or was she in fact just completely insane, you won't find out until the end, but either way, it was a knockout performance by both stars and a highly recommended film!",Hard Candy
454,Gohanto,A horror movie without the fun,7,28 April 2008,"Just my opinion, but this movie has undeniable relations to recent horror movies like Saw. These movies are usually fun or at least interesting because you can feel real sympathy for the victims and they put you in their mind to put you in that situation.This movie is very similar, except that if you actually sympathize with the character being tortured, you naturally feel guilty about it because of what he's done. Does he really deserve it? They don't show him ever doing anything wrong on screen, so it's hard not to feel sorry for him, but after his confessions it's just enough so that there's no character you can really get close to in this movie. Ellen Page might have been a character to relate to after you starting hating the guy, except she plays it so cold and calculated that it's no comforting at all to side with her. Okay, I can take a film where I'm not sympathizing with anyone, but the director is throwing everyone's face in super close-ups the entire time demanding a connection between the audience and the characters.The director had a lot of neat visual ideas and unique tricks, but ultimately didn't find a solid point of view to tell the story from leaving the audience confused. As soon as the guy confessed, there needed to be a radical shift in how the film was being shot as the audience just had the floor dropped out from under them, but the director ignored it and continued playing his pov regardless that the audience no longer has any understanding of him.Actors were both very very good. If only the director could have used the camera to help tell the story in the final act instead of emotionally confusing the audience, this could've been a really great film.",Hard Candy
455,DoGirl,"Suspense, will keep you on the edge of your seat",7,2 September 2006,"This is not the kind of movie you take your mother to during a family weekend and normally I would consider myself more of a art-house-movie kinda person, but this movie kept me on the edge of my seat for almost two hours! Never a dull moment during the entire film.I could not recall ever seeing Ellen Page (Hayley) before, but perhaps that's just my ignorance. Wauw, damn good play little lady! During the entire movie I kept wondering: ""How old is she anyway?"" This movie will not make you reconsider your personal believes in life and seeing this movie will not make you a better or happier person, but hey... if you can spare the time...",Hard Candy
456,kaislavirta,A powerful and wickedly funny movie!,8,20 June 2006,"This movie was really powerful, interesting and, in parts, full of a wonderfully black sense of humour. It is about the seemingly naive 14-year old girl Hayley, who gets picked up on the internet by Jeff, a man 18 years her senior. She soon turns out to have an agenda of her own, and the movie kicks off.The best thing about this movie, apart from the very powerful subject, is that you are never really sure of who is right. Is she a crazy girl who has watched too many horror stories on the news? Is he a nice guy who just happened to invite the wrong person? Ellen Page does a very fine job portraying both sides of her character, as does Patrick Wilson, which makes them interesting to watch throughout the movie.What keeps me from giving Hard Candy a higher score is that the ending felt a little bit too long, although I do understand why the ""finishing touches"" had to be there. This is a minor complaint and should stop no one from seeing this movie.",Hard Candy
457,Luckie Starr,Great acting and film making!,8,12 May 2005,"I was lucky enough to be in one of the first test audiences for this film in Los Angeles. Knowing nothing about the film except that it's being described as suspense/horror, and stars Patrick Wilson and a 14 year old girl, I went in expecting another bad to mediocre slash film. I couldn't have been more wrong! Hard Candy is an intense psychological drama, with incredible performances by both Ellen Page and Patrick Wilson. The two actors are practically the only two people with lines in the film, aside from some brief appearances by Sandra Oh and Jennifer Holmes. Thusfar I have only seen Wilson in The Alamo and Phantom of the Opera, but I was blown away with how he handled this performance. The slow, suspenseful film is set mainly in the Los Angeles home of photographer Jeff, a 32 year old man whom Hayley, a mature 14 year old girl who met him online, suspects to be a pedophile. The pacing was steady, and phenomenal - after a brief exposition we get into the real suspense about 20 minutes into the film, and it doesn't let up from there. The cinematography and camera work went excellently with the film. Rather than being extremely gory, the adult themes of the film lead to a more psychological creepiness. There are also questions that remain unanswered until the end of the film, when everything is wrapped up nicely - leaving you puzzled to the true identities and motives of the characters throughout most of the duration.Horror films are not my cup of tea, but psychological drama is. An early fall release date has been rumored, and I can only hope this movie doesn't get lost in the shuffle between summer blockbusters and Oscar season. I also hope Lion's Gate markets this film for what it is, and doesn't try to aim for fans of slash, or a teen crowd.",Hard Candy

Hands down the worst, most morally abject, offensive movie I have ever seen, and that's saying a lot. I enjoyed Strangeland in all its horrid glory, Kids wasn't that bad, but Hard Candy made me pray for an end to my life, or compensation for the time I wasted seeing it. Do NOT see this movie. It is lacking in plot, dialogue, and overall integrity. I will be sending a bill to all of the producers for 103 minutes of my time, perhaps even with interest. Horrid. Save yourself the time money and effort of struggling through this piece of waste. Can you give a negative rating???",Hard Candy
461,hitecballr,Top notch movie,7,8 September 2006,"Here are the ingredients: you will need 2 good actors putting on a great performance. A pretty good story and a fascinating premise. Add in a chair, rope, ice and suspense. Mix this up for about 1h 30Min and you have Hard Candy a surprising good independent picture from lions gate. The premise was unique with the story of a pedophile getting the tables turned on him by a psychotic 14 year old girl and the acting was beyond amazing especially by Page! I have not seen a movie that kept me interested with only 2 characters in years but there was an unbelievable performance by both. This is one of the best psycho movies I have seen in years and there was a really original premise to it. As a man I have to admit it was a bit over the top at some points but none the less the best thing I have seen from lions gate DVD's in ages.Ellen Page was amazing in this film! Imagine that this is the same girl who played Kitty Pryde in X-men and what a turn around that was from her sadistic character in this film. Best psycho character in years and over time as this sickening plot unfolds you will be pulled into her disturbing world. This is like watching little red riding hood get the big bad wolf and at points you will want the wolf to escape. I know if you enjoy suspense, drama and thrillers then this is a must see ( although it is harder on the eyes for men ). So check out hard candy if you get a chance.",Hard Candy
462,thermite-3,Haunting drama with excellent dialogue and acting!!,10,2 May 2008,"This movie has continued to haunt me since I first viewed it on DVD several weeks ago. I was unaware of its existence at the time of its theatrical release.The direction, camera work and screenplay are all stunning with excellent close-up shots against starkly colored backgrounds, but it is the superb acting of Ellen Page and Patrick Wilson that color the film and make the it an ""edge of your seat"" thriller! As actors they deserved more awards than they received and certainly should have had Oscar consideration but for the fact that this wasn't a mainstream motion picture, it is in my humble opinion that they were slighted.",Hard Candy
463,mark-3020,Ellen Page is a superstar,10,28 January 2007,"If I don't score this a 10/10 then I really don't have a frame of reference, this is one of the greatest low budget movies ever made. Probably the best movie I saw in 2006, just ahead of The Departed & Mission Impossible III (yes my tastes are broad).Ellen Page's performance is just awesome. I can only hope that she gets more roles worthy of her talent because in this movie she is pretty much on screen the whole time and carries it effortlessly. I have watched the movie 4 times now, in the last 3 or 4 years only Donnie Darko has made me re-watch more. Great script, great acting and the direction can't be faulted either.There is absolutely nothing predictable about this movie and that's a quality that is increasingly rare these days This is a movie that will stand the passage of time well and probably be more appreciated for the great piece of work that it is in a few years.",Hard Candy
464,burningozzy,Utter rubbish!!!,1,6 September 2006,"Jesus this movie is so awful on so many levels that i wanted to track down the makers and torture them. The script starts off well, with both characters having a well written conversation in a coffee lounge, then descends into clichéd, heard it all before lines that have come from so many good movies. 'Hayley' has to be the worst character i've seen recently, and i've seen some dire films. She actually makes you want to kill her. Her anger is so mundane and nauseating at the same time. You just want her to shut up and listen to what Jeff has to say. Don't get me wrong, some of the stuff she has to say is worth listening to, but this is bulked out with same-old same-old stereotypical rubbish.The thing that ruined it for me the most is the fact that after the 'castration torture' sequence, Jeff just wimps out. If a man had been humiliated like this by a mentally unstable '14' year old girl, i'm sure he would be a bigger man. Either hurting her, or letting her go. The film ruined the opportunity for Jeff to gain the upper hand, which is a shame. He may be as bad as 'Hayley' but we need to see that.So ultimately, in my opinion which means nothing anyway, i'd just move right along, and wait for a better movie about this unforgivable subject matter. Maybe from someone who has been a victim to a paedophile. There's sadly enough of us about!!",Hard Candy

It's disturbing and naive and unconvincing. Is 32 year old man weaker than 14 year old small ugly girl kiddo? In this film yes. He can not defense himself because ???

466,michaelalastair,Hard Candy is a definite watch!,7,21 January 2007,"There is only 2 main characters in this movie. Although Sandra Oh is included as being a main character, she has very little dialogue.The movie opens with the short Internet conversation between Hayley (Ellen Page) and Jeff (Patrick Wilson). It lasts all of just over 1 minute. It get's straight to the point without delay. After meeting at a coffee shop, Jeff then invites Hayley to his house. From then on, their relationship takes a turn for the worst, and not in the way you think.I won't go into detail but Hard Candy is definitely worth checking out.The direction is awesome and the very talented Ellen Page portrays an incredibly convincing teenage girl.The only disappointment I had with this was that Sandra Oh did not get her fair share of screen time. But with the little dialogue she was given, she made it her own.Ratings:Storyline: 9/10. Direction: 10/10. Acting: 10/10. All-in-all: 9/10",Hard Candy

It was a good movie but I did not enjoy much past the beginning of it.This is decidedly the most messed of movie of all time. They have successfully taken two sides of the moral spectrum and just scrambled the hell out of your mind.The girl does good through evil. I was left with an uncertain feeling towards the truth at the end. I found it extremely difficult to watch what the guy was mentally put through.I'm not the same after having watched this film.

Good, characters established. so far so good, we now sorta expect, he either killing her, raping..whatever...but as soon as they enter his place, we know she's playing him. okay cool...she may be a kiddie serial killer. but no. As we progress into the story, the guy becomes more and more sympathetic...DESPITE they are playing him out to be a pedophile....so in the end we are rooting for a pedophile! (okay, this has been seen before with Freddy Krueger...though he is mostly just hinted at being child killer..which of course is much more noble) and the little brat, keeps yapping on about her own beliefs, and stuff we couldn't care less about, and just every now and then making a statement that actually holds some value to the plot. So, despite what heinous deeds he may have done...which we are rarely ever actually shown any proof of.this just paints her out to be some little annoying overly self indulging psycho freak. IS that the point of the movie? To make people root for what appears to be a pedophile, by annoying the **** out of the viewer? or did I get it wrong ( because I had to play the last half on double speed, as otherwise the movie would have been boring the daylights out of me), and he wasn't guilty at all, and she was just the bad guy? ...in which case, it didn't work either. Because, the guy still WAS A creep! - just the more sympathetic one of the two. A film, that is purely a ""talkie""...with also just one room as the setting, a revenge motif, I've seen been done much better in ""killing words"" from 2003",Hard Candy
469,shizzoop,beautiful and complete,7,3 April 2007,"I know it's a little weird to describe a movie as complete, but that's how I felt about it. After the movie had come to an end I was happy with it. I thought the look of the movie was amazing and very well edited. Though I believed all of the scenes to be ""intense"", the intense action filled scenes were well shot, but I honestly was more looking forward to the dialouge, because as the viewer you learn to respect the girl and her intentions no matter how twisted they may be. Nearly everything she said was harsh and to the point and she brought up some very interesting points although she was borderline psycho, or maybe she just seemed that way since she was so intelligent for a 14 year old. The character of Jeff was a very well played part also. Although he seemed bad in the beginning you began to believe, just by the way he handled everything, that he may not have been as harmful. I would love to watch this film again soon, and I only watched it a couple days ago. It's just something that captures your attention and really brings you into the characters world. I recommend it to anyone who isn't afraid to watch something with fairly uncomfortable subject matter.",Hard Candy

Even though I am leveling with the writer I think they should kill pedophiles! I don't think it's a good idea to let little girls do the job, don't you think? SO eyes up parents, talk with your children, do not push, yell, deny, talk old times never(it's a different world now..), I'm from Finland and we have quite a problem with youth drinking. We have had situations like in the movie but quite a few haven't ended well. I'm saying this is a worldwide phenomenon, so everyone show this movie to everyone you know and spread the word!

471,philerskine,Look elsewhere,1,4 March 2012,"There seems to be a clear distinction here, browsing the reviews. On the one hand, we have the 10/10's. Those people who feel that this film explores an important issue in the modern world, portrays a thrilling and well acted drama and is well shot etc. On the other hand though, we have those people that feel it's a poorly shot, pretentious and vastly overacted little film that is so desperate to be extreme and shocking and win awards at art festivals that it forgets any form of narrative, realism and character development.I am one of the latter. Other people have phrased it better than me, but I really have to throw my own experience in the ring. Especially due to the 7.2 overall rating this film has, and the sort of reviews it gets from critics. This film literally isn't good. Why, for example does Jeff not try to escape before he's bloody castrated? He seems to be tied up by sellotape and doesn't use his superior strength to escape the little girl. Holes like that aren't the biggest problem, though as this film disgusts me. Not necessarily the subject matter (confused and warped as it is) but the way it lords over it and hurls all manner of taboo, faux pas scenes at ya it return for critical acclaim. Gross.TL;DR Don't watch it, it loves itself too much.",Hard Candy
472,bitemeloser145,It *is* a red riding hood tale,10,20 November 2008,"I don't care what the cast and crew says, more than Haley's outfit was borrowed from ""Little Red Riding Hood."" The Brothers Grimm included *two* red riding hood tales in their collection. The second was a sequel to the first. In the sequel, Red Riding Hood is on her way to her grandmother's house with another basket of goodies, when she meets another wolf, only this time she isn't fooled. Instead she goes on to grandmother's, and when the wolf shows up, she uses sausage water to lure the wolf into falling off the roof to his death.If the contrivance of having Jeff hang himself from his roof wasn't a deliberate nod to the Red Riding Hood sequel, than it is a heck of a coincidence. Especially since the movie stars a girl in a red hood, with a bag full of goodies, who uses herself as the sausage water! And since Red Riding Hood is typically interpreted as a tale warning girls against sexual predators, redoing the sequel seems an appropriate vehicle to use to construct a story supposedly inspired by Japanese schoolgirls getting back at sexual predators.",Hard Candy

Umm anyone think maybe she was not telling the truth about her age since she lied about everything else?? Probably she lured the guy by saying she was 14 ..idk just a possibility. But anywho... very good movie but i think the ending was a little weird cuz no way i would let someone torture me and let them get away free of charge. I mean OK maybe he has to hang himself or w/e but no way u gonna let Hailey live , right??? That was kinda strange for me especially since the guy was some kind of ""killer"" anyways.

It was all about a 14 year old girl having vengeance on a photographer who killed Some X girl. Ya still it can be more realistic more interesting and at least sadistic or may be bit psychic.. but you can hardly find something other than Loads of stupidity..!!I sat through the whole movie because I truly believed that somewhere in the film a real plot would emerge, or some characters would start to develop, or someone would cut out Hayley's tongue so she would finally shut up.

It made my blood boil and I would have checked my BP, of course if I had a BP monitor at disposal.Having said that I was completely relieved by the climax which was convincing and justifiable. Still, unfortunately, I must confess that even now, 12 hrs after I watched this great piece of movie making, I'm sympathetic towards Jeff who had a terrible ordeal before the final revelations.Ellen Page is going places for sure.Peace!",Hard Candy
476,suneskeel,painfully bad,1,2 March 2015,"this movie succeeded in making me feel terrible. and not because of all the horrible torture scenes, no, but because it made me sympathise with a pedophile. this movie is horrible on almost every level, the characters are shallow, the so called anti hero, Hailey, is so one Layered, that she is basically a sheet of paper, with the word revenge written on it. and thats it, no explanations of why, she is like that, what happened to her, no character development through the movie, she is basically just a psychopathic sadist, on what seems to be a revenge rampage. Jeff is the victim in this movie, and even thou he is a pedophile, who was there at the murder of a girl, you still sympasthise with him. And thats just all wrong, why would make a movie where you sympathise with a pedophile...? is it done on purpose? or is it just really poor film making?not to mention the whole realistic issue with a small 14 year old girl dragging a man around his house, tying him up. I am specially impressed with how she got him to his ""suicicde position"". I am a grown man, and I don't think I could have done that to someone unconscious. there are many weak points of this movie, the neighbour scene, why? clearly something is going on, Hailey is bleeding, she hears noise, and then... nothing... ???? .... ????

The movie is too bad to be spoiled.Annoying from the beginning which made me turn it off after only few minutes. The next day I gave it a second chance. What the hell was I thinking about!? This movie is not gruesome, twisted, or disturbing in any way. That topic was ""discussed"" several times before in more disturbing ways if you are looking to be disturbed. Even though I don't understand why any movie should be so obviously, and deliberately made ""disturbing"" to make people understand the problem. People who are finding this piece of poo to be an eye-opener to the subject, should really visit one of those 4/5 doctors who told the little Super-hero something about her (in)sanity.The only disturbing thing is the fact that many people see this as some sort of art dealing with very important issue. This movie has no value at all. The storyline is boring, the characters are dull, acting is bad, dialogue too, and so on I made no connection with characters and couldn't care less what happens to them.

479,DonLogan,Honestly it's bad- iit should be called 'Soft Sweets',1,11 September 2006,"I saw this film today with a friend and we found ourselves laughing at it throughout for all the wrong reasons. There were so many aspects that made this film terrible so i'll try and remember the ones which seemed the most obvious. Firstly the script and the dialogue within it was very weak. The way, Jeff, the central male character, spoke was so clunky and unnatural it was incredible. In his ipod, apple style bulllshyte house he came up with such joys as- 'I'm not the monster you think i am''- your certainly not an actor 'Jeff'. The female, i believe her character was called Hayley got on my nerves to the point where i thought simply thought knocking her out and then shouting 'fuck off!' through a megaphone into her ear might be the best course of action. It was nigh on impossible to feel any sympathy for either character- they were both unnatural and repellent and far too good looking in that typical Hollywood way that gurantees viewers. I realise that its dealing with paedophilia, a touchy subject (mainly created by the media- check the UK's brass eye paedophile special) but it dealt with it terribly. Although there were 'twists'- oh wow twists!!- they were stupid and devisive and made the film feel like any other thriller with a femme fatale. I realise this isn't the most eloquent of comments but it was a bloody annoying film- all new films seem to be. Oh yeah here's another thing that got on my nerves- the way it was shot. It seems like a really annoying trend nowadays to shoot films in a kind of grainy hand-held style where all the action scenes are really shaky supposedly giving them an air of authenticity- not true, its just irritating. a lot of the film looked like a ford or vw advert- it was bad...really bad and it dealt with its subject matter appallingly but I'm sure loads of people will read this and say how great it was. i know people are entitled to their opinions but this was crap. i miss Kubrick he wouldn't have stood for tosh like this.

Ellen Page was not convincing at all. She's supposed to be the protagonist of the film, but the whole time I keep wishing Jeff would escape and kill her. The castration scene though showed nothing was still pretty sick. It was disgusting and truly stupid. Jeff cries for a bit then gets up and acts like it never happened. The girl was a creep and i felt no sympathy whatsoever for her. This movie was disappointing. I feel like everyone is saying it was a powerful film, only because it was about sexually abused victims taking power back. If you wanna look at this from a purely objective standpoint, the acting sucked and the plot line was ridiculous.

But by half-way through the film I was hoping the paedophile would escape from this nasty vindictive urchin. When you find yourself cheering for the bad-guy (and there's no doubt he *is* a bad guy) that's a clear sign the film has failed. And don't get the idea that this is the result of it portraying some sort of deep, complex moral question - the morality of the film is simple and stark.While paedophilia is a pretty simple moral question, that's no excuse for the heavy-handed and distinctly vapid approach adopted here. 'Who are you?' Jeff screams towards the end of the film. The truth is that Page's character is nothing, just an empty shell defined solely by her desire for revenge. Jeff is just as empty, we are given nothing of his character other than a trite, if rather shocking, account of how he was sexually abused by his aunt at the age of 9. It's no surprise that Slade learnt his trade making music videos, this film has all the depth of an MTV clip.You expect a psychological thriller to have two things: psychology and thrills. This has neither. And those looking for a strong performance from Ellen Page should look elsewhere.",Hard Candy
483,paoloribas,The worst ****ing movie ever,1,29 April 2013,"This is easily the worst movie I've ever seen. Its OK to make a movie against pedophilia, but this movie is unbelievable and really stupid. It's meant to be serious, but I think Lord of the Rings is more believable than this.I will give an example of how ""Tom and Jerry""-like this movie is: Whats the chance of a skinny 14 years old girl, with no more than 80lbs of weight, be able to body-knock a 32 years old guy, who is 1,85m tall, into a bath? There isn't any chance at ALL, anyone who has a little bit of a clue knows that what would happen is that the little girl would injury her own arms by trying to do that. A taser wouldn't help her in that task either since i don't believe tasers can throw people around.Anyway, i believe this was the first time i got angry by watching a movie and felt like buying a DVD just so I could DESTROY it with a sledge hammer and then BURN it to ashes.There is simply nothing positive to say about this movie. They should give free therapy to whoever thought of writing such useless, insane and laughable story.",Hard Candy
484,bjorkwrist,Capital Punishment,1,29 November 2006,"This movie is a subtle yet heavily unclever pro-capital punishment argument. It's like hearing a child trying to convince you that you should do something, and they always use the most extreme circumstance. eg... ""You don't believe in capital punishment? what about pedophiles!!!???"" You get my point.Not sure if it was funded by the people who funded the Cidar House Rules, but it was made by the same type of idiot.and as a sub-point to this, the dialogue was dreadful, the line-delivery was overdone and slow, and the casting was a little absurd.DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE.

The viewers who wrote that they hated this movie - each and every one of them thought that the girl actually castrated the guy. C 'mon, people, if you didn't even watch the movie how can you say you hated it? She did not castrate him, she didn't even nick his balls. And whatever she put in the garbage disposal, it wasn't the guy's gonads. After he manages to sit up he says out loud, ""Hey, I'm all here!""(or there, I forget) I guess he thought he didn't feel anything because of the ice, but he didn't feel anything because there was nothing to feel.I agree that the psychological torture was gruesome, and if I were a guy I don't think I could watch it. But it was psychological torture, not real mutilation. So she coerced him into killing himself. Well, I think unless he had real guilt feelings, he wouldn't have done it.I thought this was a brilliant film, and it really gave me a lot to think about.",Hard Candy

But, through out the evolution of the film you don't know who to fell sorry for, the underage girl or the guy. I really liked it because it had my mind flip flopping from one to the other of who to sympathize with and I would have never guessed in a million years the ending. Not only was the plot great but, the cinematography was brilliant, the different temperatures of the colors and the contrasts of the brightness on the darkness was absolutely genius. All in all, I would highly recommend renting this or checking it out at your library.",Hard Candy
487,shelleyannleedahl,"Exceptional film, aptly titled",10,14 January 2007,"There is little not to admire in this bizarre, intelligent story about a precocious 14 year old -- the actor Hayley Stark, whom one cannot take his/her eyes off of -- and a pedophile 32 year old. Even in its opening scenes, when matters progress as one might expect, viewers sense that this film is going to be unique. I could laud the acting, the mis en scene (note how all the colours are presented in solids; the extensive use of the red wall -- symbolic, in part, for blood in the film's central scene); the fact that many of the shots are done in close-up, so the characters are literally ""in your face"" and you can't look away; the unconventional plot; and much more, but what was particularly striking was a single image -- on the rooftop -- near the end of the film. You'll know it when you see it. That one image is like an excellent last line in a short story: even if the film was not already consistently superior to most contemporary films I've seen in the last five years, that single, memorable shot would redeem it, as a resonant last line can redeem an otherwise mediocre story. At times, my sympathies transferred between the girl and the man -- a testament to the quality of the acting, on both parts. If I have one criticism, it concerns the scene with Sandra Oh -- it was almost jarring in its disparity within the rest of the film. A nod toward comic relief? It just didn't work for me. Perhaps the part was miscast.The story also raises many interesting and, to this writer, unanswerable questions regarding the practice of photography and children. When does it cease to become art and instead become lecherous voyeurism, or pedophilia? Also, questions regarding intergenerational friendships between men and adolescent girls. Are they not possible without sexual under/overtones? The film makes a statement re: internet chatting, which, could lead to spirited family or classroom discussions. And finally, it also raises questions about crime and punishment. Bravo to the writer for giving us a young protagonist who is articulate and mature, yet still entirely credible. This is definitely a film to recommend, and to watch more than once. Unfortunately I missed it when it was in theatres. Fortunately I can rent it at my local Rogers Video, and watch it with my daughter. Hard Candy. Perfect title for a provocative film that, for some viewers, might be particularly hard to chew.",Hard Candy
488,n-pontikos,"sick, unrealistic, pointless",1,21 June 2006,"This movie was so ridiculous it made people laugh out loud. Unrealistic, stupid, sick, pointless - just a few of the adjectives that spring to mind when I think of this movie. A girl somehow manages to subdue a full grown man, lift him up on a chair and tie him up, then lift him on a table and tie him up, then pretend to castrate him and making him cry like a little boy, then stands him up on a chair with a noose around his neck then lures him on the roof and convinces him to kill himself. OK already the scent of bullshit is hard to ignore but that's just a taster... The girl's character is just simply unrealistic both in her thoughts, emotions and actions. What seemed to be a manipulative teenage girl at the start, turned out to be a crazy sadistic bitch. The excuse she gives for her actions is that she is insane... OK fine a fourteen year old criminally insane mastermind that seems to know everything about this guy, that is always in control and is capable of tossing around and tying up a grown man and making him plead for his life on the grounds that she suspects him to be a paedophile. Fair enough most thrillers often over do it when it comes to the shear foresight of the hunter/killer/bad guy, he is always prepared for all eventualities. However rarely is the bad guy a fourteen year old bitchy smart ass teenager. Sorry but I need to stop now my automatic crap detector has gone haywire...",Hard Candy
489,muomo,Just not good,3,31 August 2017,"It has a somewhat promising start, but the dwindle down into sadistic torture happened too quickly and without enough exposition to justify it. Essentially, it ends up just looking like To Catch a Predator but instead of the cops being called, the predator is castrated immediately. There is simply not enough information given to make you hate what you are told to think is a sick pedophile, nor is there enough information to make you feel that Hayley is justified in her actions. The ending was just weird, and I still don't quite get why Janelle was even a thing.This movie was NOT thrilling and the castration scene was weak. I didn't need to see the castration play-by-play, but there are plenty of ways to make a gruesome scene still seem gruesome even if it occurs off-screen. The girl is also stupid and should've done something to ensure that he could not move. As tiny as she was, if he was able to get the upper-hand for even a second, that would've been the end for her.I also don't get why Sandra Oh's name is presented like she was relevant.

I recorded it off TV - glad it cost me nothing - and whizzed through much of it on fast forward. Not a good sign. My assumption is that the Page character is not real; she's meant to be a personification of his guilt at having been in some way involved in the death of this other girl who disappeared. That would explain a few things.It would explain why she doesn't act like a 14 year old girl, talks (pretentiously and endlessly) like someone much older, is able to manhandle her victim in ways which would be physically impossible and so on.It would also explain why, although he has plenty of opportunities to escape from this situation, he never takes any of them. I suppose he's meant to be struggling within himself, intends to castrate himself but can't go through with it and eventually commits suicide.Of course this doesn't explain how this personification of his own guilt is able to interact with his neighbour but then this is a film so you don't expect logic or consistency or really anything much at all.",Hard Candy

It will really surprise you with its quite nice originality and theme that is not common. Most likely you have not seen anything like this before. Girl actress is awesome, and the whole movie is well made and works like an oiled machine. It catches you fast with its grip and holds you there. Its simple, straightforward and genius. A very nice movie-experience, so to say. Couple minor scenes in the end are hanging a bit in the ear, and there's some playing with unreality, but it is so minor it most likely wont even bother you.

But this was unexpected and turned out to be very very good psychological drama thriller.I was amazed by Elliot's acting, the micro expressions all over the movie, specially at the beginning was just amazing how she portrayed a vulnerable girl and then later reveals she is not who we think she is.Of Course this may be an one time watch because of details held in the film. Many may find it very disturbing to watch, even tho there is literally no gore scene, just the reactions of the actors.Pace wise, Some may find slow at times as the movie starts with very fast cutscenes and then slows down sometimes to increase the burn.

At the beginning of the film the colors were black and white. It gives the opening scenes this feel of ""nothing could go wrong"" because it looks like those happy black and white television shows from way back. As the mood of the movie progresses the colors become more vibrant and a lot of red is used. Also, I liked the way the color red was used on the character Hayley. It made her look like little red riding hood ready to be a victim to Jeff the big bad wolf. Second, the acting was incredible. Patrick Wilson and Ellen Page did a perfect job at transitioning their characters throughout the film. Last, and this may sound weird, but the cover art is awesome on this DVD.

I ached every time I thought about it over the next couple of weeks. I was really excited to see Hard Candy at first. I thought it looked neat. I liked the cover, and the synopsis on the back intrigued me. So, like a fool, I rented it.Oh my God. What happened to character development? They made the effort with Jeff. They had him tell one story about his past. One. It wasn't much, but it was enough that I grew to like him, just a little bit. Unfortunately, it shouldn't have been Jeff that I was growing to like, and, possibly, love. It should have been Hayley. Here's this little psychotic girl who's running around drugging pedophiles so she can kill them and saying, ""I am every little girl you've ever touched!"" over and over again. She was a total pain in the ass. I wanted her to die. I wanted Jeff to break free, kill her, and then go get some therapy to help him quit having sex with children. That shouldn't have been the case. I should have been on Hayley's side, which I would have been if she'd actually had a past that allowed me to empathize with her motives.I sat through the whole movie because I truly believed that somewhere in the film a real plot would emerge, or some characters would start to develop, or someone would cut out Hayley's tongue so she would finally shut up.I loathed this movie.

If you haven't been warned of its content, the first disturbing image you see makes you not want to continue watching, and change it to something else. It does get a good point across, which I always like to see in any movie. However, even after getting it's point across, it beats a dead horse with the continuation of torture tactics by Hayley, and, as awful as this is to say, you start to sympathize with Jeff. Then again, that may have been the director's motive, which, if so, he did a good job. You have to have a very open mind while watching this, and if you do, you should be able to at least get all the way through it. It's worth renting, not buying.",Hard Candy

There is no need for other intervenients, those two catch your attention completely. The performances are outstanding. Sometimes you almost take the eyes off the screen because things get so intense (even though you never see anything explicit or very violent, but the descriptions and the sweat on their faces and clothes are more than enough) but you don't want to miss anything really. I wasn't sure of the ending until I saw it, there is much you can especulate about during the film. It is shocking, but it also alerts.

The story could not be effectively told without the 'sick bits'.There were some script oddities, the one that especially sticks in my mind is the neighbour questioning her about walking on the roof, and why she was there, etc, without commenting on the fact that she was wearing surgical scrubs while doing so.I'm sure this movie will play on my mind for a while yet, it's very reminiscent of ""Saw"", not in the plot, but in the suspense and human-horror of it.

Page plays the part of an insane teenage girl very well. Great psychological thriller  sort of reminded me of the movie Saw, especially with the surgery scene. A few people have commented on how Page's character is a bit insane, but what you need to realize early on with this movie is that Page's character is very much a sociopath. She feels no emotion after having done all these things. That's evident especially when she's talking on the phone and nonchalantly asks her friend if she'd like to see a movie later. Oh's role in this movie is very small, and somewhat unnecessary. You think she's going to do something, and Wilson's character even blatantly says she might. She never does, though, which was sort of disappointing.Overall, a good movie. Don't see it if you are easily disturbed by the theme of online predators. There is one surgery scene which some squeamish people may not like (especially men *hint * hint*). You never actually see the surgery being preformed though. Not a good family movie.

The whole movie. This just doesn't go. I don't really think that portraying a young girl that does that is right. It is actually very disturbing, and I'm not saying that just because I'm a guy and the guy's the victim in the movie, I'm saying it because that's what it's like. Had it been a boy instead of a girl, it would have been as disturbing as it is now. Anyway, I think that maybe girls would like this movie more, because, well, it talks about an independent girl making justice for herself, but that's just for teenager girls probably seeing Hayley and saying ""hey, look, a girl can be independent"". Well, this is not the best way to do that. I am really really shocked by this movie, it has been a complete waste of time, and even worse, it actually made me quite mad.

Instead, I was treated to a highly implausible interaction of pshyoctic minds, one a fledgling pedophile, the other (the main protagonist) a revenge-bent ""honor student"" from hell with cunning and cruelty that would make Ghenghis Khan blush. The film starts off somewhat slow and predictable, and we quickly jump into the meat and potatoes of this gorefest, as our 14-year old ""heroine"" proceeds to psychically and psychologically torture his victim. BUt, wait he gets away from her! No, he's captured again, and the plot line resumes. These cheap vehicles are used to drive a plot full of holes, with zero character development and explanations. Who, what, where, why? None of them merit any answers, in the opinion of the snobbish sycophant of a director. But wait, that doesn't make sense! Also of no consequence. This film epytomizes is what is wrong with movies today: we are told we are supposed to like something, so many people will, because they feel they would be considered dumb if they did not. This film is the product of bad acting, and ideas. Stay away.",Hard Candy
514,frenky_dee,great movie with a very unsatisfactory ending,6,17 February 2008,"the movie itself is great, rating 8 out of 10. the way the emotion of the leading characters is displayed is awesome, accompanied by great camera-work it creates a real thrill. for me and some of my friends (with whom i watched it) i started to really build up a feeling of hate towards the girl, in a way of 'ow my friggin god, you need help because you are completely off the rocker'.then in the end, the guy hangs himself, doing exactly what the girl wants. whether she does or does not clean up the evidents is no longer relevant. she has displayed evil in the whole movie and even in the end she gets it her way. i find this non-punishing ending that much disturbing that even half an hour later i was still thinking 'how can she get away with that, that isn't how it should be'. to me the end is so frustrating that it devaluates the experience of the movie in total. so it end up with a 6 out of 10 rating.",Hard Candy
515,jakesnice,The Remarkable Ellen Page,9,2 April 2008,"I purchased this movie about 6 months ago expecting something very different from what it presents on the cover. I was very surprised, yet disturbed by how smart this movie was. Both lead characters played pitch perfect by both actors. Especially by one of the most talented actresses to date, Ellen Page. Her role is what had me watching throughout the entire movie. Not knowing if her intentions are pure or just pure insanity is what really had me intrigued. Is she a little girl who happens to be plenty book smart and hip on modern culture? Or is she not who she seems? Page makes you believe her character is that sweet, vulnerable, little girl who doesn't seem capable of causing harm to anyone. Her character makes you think she is the victim. But with Page's remarkable ability to convince you otherwise of her innocence, your immediately brought into her own little nightmare. It's intense and has a couple of scenes that even the non-squeamish would flinch too(especially if your of the male gender). Watch it with an open mind and appreciate the impressive acting that is displayed in this little gem of a movie.",Hard Candy

That said, the CONTENT of this film is so base and disgusting that I left thinking I was WORSE off as a human for having seen it. So, this is art? Personally, I'll be more careful not to venture into HELL again -- I'll just take Satan's word for it ...Content vs. performance/execution are at stake here, and again, while the performances and delivery are first-rate, I just cannot reiterate how gross, pathetic, and vile the content of this movie is. Page's character (a true psycho/socio-path) is so BAD that she makes the legitimate Pedophile SYMPATHETIC! I just wanted him to blow her freaking head off to exterminate her from the human race. So, if the Director wanted to draw favorable attention to defeating pedophilia, then he failed MISERABLY.",Hard Candy
517,jedalton33,Excessively morally disturbing,4,21 February 2009,"If not for its excellent acting (the better of which is by Patrick Wilson), I'd have given Hard Candy one star instead of four. Ellen Page is effectively complex for the first third of the film, after which she takes on a role that's little more than an over-acted conduit of hateful sadism.One would hope that in a modern civilized society, individuals wouldn't engage in old testament style barbarism against even the guiltiest of criminals. Of course, the pedophile is a hated creature, understandably so. For an adult to sexually take advantage of a child is a truly depraved thing. In the United States, child molesters are often brutalized to the fullest extent if they end up in prison. In Hard Candy, however, the brutalization is carried out not by immoral prison inmates, but by a fourteen year old girl.Criminals should be brought to justice. The more severe the crime, the more severe the penalty should be. This is why systems, laws exist. Ironically, Hayley (Page) says so herself when she tells Jeff (Wilson) after she discovers the pictures, ""This is why those federal laws exist, Jeff."" Despite saying this, she proceeds to not call the authorities but to engage in a calculated, disgusting measure of vigilante justice. In no way am I insinuating that pedophiles don't deserve to answer for their crimes, but this? For a fourteen year old girl to not only inflict physical pain but psychological torment as well, as she sarcastically snickers and plays word games with a guy who's about to have his balls scissored off by a high school freshman? I don't care what the context is; cruelty is never cool.The movie gets its message across rather early on. By the time it's halfway over, we've been treated to a gratuitous portion of excessive cruelty. Point made! The only thing left for me to conclude was that Hard Candy is a movie that wants to tell viewers that sometimes it's okay to take the law into your own hands, no matter how old you are, and mete out justice however you see fit. That kind of premise is fine if we're talking about a movie like Commando or Above the Law. This is very different.I suspect that pedophilia must be a kind of psychiatric illness, for who would willingly choose to live out a life they know will be despised and feared by others? No normal, healthy person would choose to be sexually aroused by children. We are not genetically mapped that way; it's not in our biology. If there is no treatment yet available for curing this kind of sickness, then the responsibility of any modern, evolved society is to prevent those afflicted with the disorder from doing any more harm. This prevention should be in the form of legal (maybe permanent) incarceration, not home job castrations and murders masterminded by angry children.",Hard Candy
518,ashutosh-iitm,Amateur attempt at a thriller,4,21 August 2010,"Some good things about the movie: Good Acting & Camera work. A lot of bad things though: Amateur effort at best, No Character Development, Terrible Ending. This is one of those movies that actually goes backwards. The start is the best part of the movie and from there its just downhill. It would have been so much better if there were some logic behind all of what was happening. The torture is being dished out as thrill. More similar to an illogical horror movie than anything else.The lead actors are impressive though. I just wish they had a wee bit more to work with as far as the script goes. Somehow all the focus has been on the physical torture where it would have been great to see some mature treatment with the kind of talent the director had.",Hard Candy

One is a 14 year old girl, the other a thirty-something photographer. All intrigue is lost, however, once they arrive at the photographer's house, where the remainder of the movie is shot. It reminds of ""Misery"" except the entire experience, including the ending, is much worse. The movie leaves a horrible feeling with you, one I would imagine is on par with listening to the Iraqi testimony on Saddam's torture chambers. Regardless of the quality of the acting, which was superb, the movie is not an entertainment piece. This is an exercise in the pointless grotesque and should be avoided at all costs.",Hard Candy
520,Before_Sunrise,Why you don't need a high budget to make a perfect film.,10,4 January 2007,"I've been a member of IMDb for years and this is the first comment I've ever written. I was so impressed by this film that I was compelled to write this.The story is told in the 3rd-person in one afternoon. It begins immediately with no flashbacks or monologues. The synopsis states that the ""fine line between predator and prey slips slowly out of focus"". As the story unfolds, you continue to question yourself: Which one is the protagonist and antagonist? Who is the real victim? Is this person really as they present him/herself to be? There's no clear good guy or bad guy. Also, there are no obvious twists. Watching this movie was like reading a good page-turning novel. You're presented with information, but the story is interpreted through your imagination. With the very simple setting and the 2-person cast, we are focused mostly on the dialog and let me tell you, each minute of the film is used efficiently. There isn't one unnecessary moment. You will not be bored.The delivery was outstanding. This is really what carried the movie. It could have been made similarly to ""Dogville"", on a theater set, and the movie would have been just as good. Ellen Page's performance was ""oscar-worthy"" as they say. Not even taking into account her age, this was very very impressive work. She's like the female Haley Joel Osment. She's obviously a gifted actress and I hope to see more of her in the future.Overall, this is a movie that is not worth passing up. It's truly unlike any other. Can't find a single cliché in the film.",Hard Candy
521,moviediva67,"Taunt, Brave Thriller (Minor Spoilers, So Read with Caution)",9,5 January 2007,"""Hard Candy"" is not your typical thriller. It has a fascinating premise of a high schooler turning the tables on a potential pedophile, obviously something too edgy for mainstream American cinema. This film also explores something almost never addressed in film, which is the victimization of a male by a female. This issue was touched on fleetingly in films like ""Fatal Attraction"" and ""Misery,"" but these films focus mainly on physical violence or emotional stress against the male. This film, however, focuses on the idea of not only physical and emotional violence, but sexual violence against a male. Hayley's crusade to victimize our alleged pedophile in the same way young women are constantly objectified and victimized in our culture is both insane and thought-provoking as to her motives and whether or not her brand of vigilantism is something we can swallow. This film is not perfect, but I give the filmmakers kudos for working with this material, which is flawed, but applaudable in its originality and bravery. Few filmmakers would touch such subject matter with a 50 foot pole.That said, you do not have to be a bra-burning, ball-busting feminist to enjoy this film (I am not). Stellar performances by Patrick Wilson and Ellen Page draw the viewer in not only with their brilliant acting, but their fantastic delivery of truly intelligent dialouge, something else also absent from mainstream cinema these days. Particular attention should be paid to the give-it-his-all performance from Wilson, who lets us feel every heartbeat, every bead of sweat in his ordeal. Director David Slade creates a tense, claustrophobic atmosphere that such a small, two actor film needs to be successful. The color in this film is also incredible. Slade also wisely avoids showing the audience too much, relying instead on the performances to dictate the action. Beware, however, as some of the subject matter is not for the squeamish. Stick it out, because it's worth it.In close, ""Hard Candy"" is a fantastic film that will raise questions and debate from society as long as it is shown.",Hard Candy

523,tadams20032004,Amazing Turn Around Film,10,28 March 2006,"I saw an advance screening at E street cinema in D.C. last weekend, and i met the director and actor, Patrick Wilson. I have to say this film was quite amazing. It was an amazing observation of the typical 'villian' or 'hero' themes. The film turns around the themes and makes you wonder who to support and makes you feel odd or good for who you may feel sympathy for. The film also uses a great technique; although the writing is written by a play write (and noticeably) and is done in such a way that involves a two character back and forth in one situation and one house/location. However the technique the director uses an expressionist technique (which he spoke to me about) not only to issue a sense of tension and panic, as it involves odd focus and a lacking-depth of field: this leads to the sense of tension, as you only focus on the characters faces mostly; it shows you a bit of the other areas then goes back to a small depth of field in order to heighten the tension of the characters.The film is very well written and created - the story presents itself immediately, and it is an observation on the reverse-archetypes that the characters are. Haley (the character) becomes more and more evil during the film and more and more we discover her maliciousness and cunning evilness. Wilson's character is presented as a pedophile, and we slowly see throughout the movie deeper and deeper the horrors of this curse he has. However he is trapped, taken hostage, beaten, even 'castrated' (if you see it you'll understand -> very intense and well made scene) and you begin to sympathize with him. This is also due in part to Wilson and Page's performances; they are both very realist, and very emotive - amazing facial techniques with the lacking depth of field.Overall amazing film - great story, and in my books, a classic (also i would put either of the two mains as the greatest villains of all time) SEE THIS FILM - GIVE IT MONEY - it's worth it. Trust me, please.",Hard Candy
524,JoesphJames,Old news not done as well or actors desperate for work,1,6 June 2006,"Brian Nelson's re-write of ""Extremities"", another rape/revenge, two-hander doesn't make it. The problems seem to be casting, cheesy dialogue and believability. Ellen Page, who looks 20, though I've heard was 17 at the time of shooting, plays an androgynous, man hating, feminist with boy-like characteristics that tortures a potential murder suspect. Page's delivery is unbelievable because the dialogue and story concept is preposterous. Her dialogue sounds more like ramblings from a philosophy term paper than any normal speech. To top it off, Page has only one delivery. Like a piano with only one key she can only play one note though, one suspects that if she had a better script she might be capable of more. I felt more sympathy for her stuck in a bad movie than I did for any of the story characters. Patrick Wilson fares much better. He at least, has some dialogue with which to work. He does do well even though the script lacks believability. Story logic? Sorry, there are more holes in this script than your broken window screen. No conclusive evidence is shared with the audience of any criminality on the part of Wilson's character, Wilson's character escapes from his 85 lb. captor numerous times but always manages to be recaptured easily, and on and on, too many to list. You are finally left with ""Little Red Riding Psychotic"" meandering into the sunset. Is there a sequel where she is hunted down by over zealous LA cops and beaten ALA, ""Rodney King""? The people I saw it with found it laughable, agitating, pornographic and banal. One woman remarked, ""This has set back the feminist movement forty years"". Perhaps David Slade should stick to music videos. Pedophilia is a serious subject and not served well by sensationalism. Makes me wonder how Spielberg would handle it. Look at his results with the Holocaust (Schindler's List). Now wouldn't he do the cause of ""Eradicating Internet Preditors"" justice? A story with real heart?

So the story is about a bratty, super annoying, know-it-all 14yo girl who is fishing for pedophiles in chat rooms and acts like Lolita in hopes that she will find them and be a hero by torturing and killing them. She finds a 32yo guy who supposedly killed a girl. It was watchable in the beginning, but when she tied him up it just goes downhill. She is castrating him, torturing him, manipulating him into suicide and is just plain disgusting to watch cause it just goes over the top and you have a feeling that whoever wrote the script has deep psychological issues and is using this to relieve some emotional anger. The main actress is extremely evil and repulsive. Now don't get me wrong, i hate pedophiles, but after all the things she did to him you kind of start to sympathize with the ""villain"" and hope he breaks loose and rapes her. Wait! Are these the emotions that a movie should invoke? No! Don't watch this garbage. Oh, and isn't it ironic that the main character in the movie is 14yo, but is played by a 18yo girl? Kind of shows that the looks and real age can really be deceiving, which is a argument often used by pedophiles! What a disaster....",Hard Candy
529,eelb,An angry film with a definite agenda,5,6 November 2006,"This film had mostly positive reviews by the major critics, and having some interest in the subject matter, I decided to give it a viewing. The film is basically a one act play, and very little happens that is not predictable from watching the trailer or reading previous reviews. Most of the plot line will appeal mainly to vengeful child sex abuse activists, who only wish such actions could be legally replicated in real life.If viewed strictly as a piece of propaganda to deter sexual predators, the film serves it purpose. NBC's Chris Hanson, can only wish he had this impact in the ""To Catch a Predator"" TV series. Having said that, the film lacks a storyline to maintain anything beyond a passing interest. The girl is far from the type that most men are going to choose in an internet liason. She's far too intelligent, and her physical appearance has a Lyndie England persona, that is both violently aggressive and sexually unappealing. Most men would seek a subject more easily manipulated, and possessing a higher level of nymphet sexuality. Casting an Olson twin type, and adding some sexual foreplay into the plot, would have made the film much more interesting. As is, the film consist primarily of contrived dialog, with the two characters trying to prove their intellectual prowess to one another. Than there's the extended medical procedure, that is telegraphed throughout the early parts of the movie. The scene does little to hold interest, other than to make the viewer grit their teeth.This film does not contain the substance to make it either a good grade B horror or sex flick. And the lack of character development does not give it a true art/indie type quality. The sole purpose seems to be the hope that it will scare potential sex predators.",Hard Candy
530,tristyn-kelley,Potential blown,6,24 June 2013,"I was excited to watch this film, as I love Ellen Page, see Patrick Wilson as a good actor, and was interested in the director's take on pedophilia. Unfortunately, what I got is described as this:Great camera work; honestly, the color toning to the mood was brilliant and well executed. Very subtle and a nice touch to the cinematography. The telephoto style was nice and pleasing to the eye as well.Overacting; I'm not talking about Jeff (Patrick Wilson) here, he actually acted how I would if I were tied to a table about to endure scrotal theft. But Haley (Ellen Page), good grief. It's like the director filmed her for the first 15 minutes or so like any other actor, then injected hormones into her with a ballpoint pen! Suddenly she acts like an avid serial killer who is 14(?), not how someone that age would behave.An ending that would disappoint anyone; Don't get me wrong, I don't encourage pedophilia, or speak for it, but by the end of this movie, I wanted that damn 14-year-old psycho-sadistic trainwreck off the planet! But instead, this man who obviously has a problem (you think someone would choose to be a pedophile?) in need of counselling/medicating, decides to hang himself in order to escape the guilt, in promise that all of this evidence of an annoyingly irrelevant subplot will be destroyed. And even after this happens, that sociopath still decides to keep the evidence. You just met this guy, now you want to leave him guilty, (sort of) remove his balls, and torture him just because he has an issue? I think this movie accidentally kicked itself in the behind, unknowingly being supportive of the whole ""why should the cops deal with something you can?"" attitude.The point is, Hard Candy screwed up.",Hard Candy

They do not show any racy scenes with kids in them. There is a scene where Jeff is ""being castrated."" Of course you find out that he was not really being castrated, it was a trick put on by Haley to make Jeff only THINK he was. It is a ridiculous movie, and I gave it a 3 based purely on the acting.

532,sssbbb-1,Dreadful movie,1,15 October 2006,"This is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. Unless you enjoy seeing a pedophile tortured by an angry teenager--that's honestly ALL that happens in about two hours--avoid this sick movie like the plague. The first few minutes of the movie had promise. Teenager Hayley meets an older man, a photographer through an online chat room, and we feel uncomfortable for her because we've seen this scenario before; man lures younger girl or boy, girl or boy is hurt, kidnapped, or murdered. But she was the one that actually came on to him (and he was quite attractive, she was very smart and winning), so I thought, well, there's promise. This might be a different kind of movie. And it was, but she tortured him rather than the other way around--so does that make it better?--in a vengeance scenario. And as sick as it sounds, you want *him* to get out of it, b/c she is cruel and we don't know whether or not he's guilty (we later learn he took pictures of the murdered child, which takes away any sympathy we had for him, but doesn't make her vigilante actions any more appealing or acceptable). The acting was strong (well by her--he mostly sweated and screamed, b/c that's literally all he got to do after the first 15 minutes), but that doesn't justify the premise or, more importantly, the movie's execution, no pun intended. I'm sorry I spent more than a few minutes watching this dreadful movie, and I'm telling everyone I know to stay clear.",Hard Candy

I would never leave him alone or even anywhere near my kid! What a creepy guy/character.She is also good in her role and I found myself really sympathizing with her.The movie is very uncomfortable to have to watch and the end won't tie everything up like most films do but it is worth watching if you like uncomfortable horror movies and just watching good, creepy performances.",Hard Candy
534,CM-Punk,Major letdown,1,6 December 2009,"I bought Hard Candy several months ago, but I never got around to watching it till tonight. I heard lots of good things about the movie, specifically about Page's performance. While my eagerness to watch the film obviously went down since I bought it, I decided to watch it anyway.I ended up turning this movie off after forty minutes. I found no entertainment out of this movie, nor did it make me think about its message. I found this movie to be so unbelievable and alienating that I couldn't even manage to watch half of it before turning it off. I think that my main problem with it is that the movie doesn't have a protagonist. Instead, the movie gives you two antagonists and attempts to make a movie around that; it doesn't work. To me it seemed like Page's character was meant to be the protagonist of the two. Why? The movie did not give any reason to cheer for her. So she makes paedophiles/murders kill themselves for justice, yet she breaks more laws than they do in the end. How does that make you want to root for her? That only makes the viewer want to see her get her punishment in the end. That kind of thing may work in Saw, or another torture-porn movie, but it doesn't work in a movie that takes itself as serious as Hard Candy does. Almost as soon as Page's character tied up Wilson's, I was rooting for him to break free and kill her. She does not do a single thing to make you believe that what she is doing is something that is actually a good thing. Add in the fact that she is supposed to be a fourteen year old girl in this movie, and in my opinion it makes the entire movie unbelievable. If it wasn't for the unique twist of the young girl torturing the man, then this movie would have been a completely generic torture movie.I wanted to give this movie a chance. I really did. I am a huge fan of Page's work, and I expected this to be a really good movie. I realize that it is impossible for me to fully critique a movie that I did not watch in its entirety, but I honestly could not sit and watch another minute of this movie. It is without a doubt one of the biggest letdowns of a movie I have ever seen.",Hard Candy

If you're a rape victim of any kind, you'll probably think he got what he had coming to.Well im telling you, Hailey is a very disturbed girl, and no matter what Jeff did or did not, nothing is gonna justify what she did. An eye for eye only makes us become what we so despise. Love will always prevail. I mean, pretty much the entire movie i was totally tensed up, half way thru the movie i totally wanted to kill the little b*tch and near the end vile thoughts of tying her up and then raping her for days on end came up. There was so much anger in me, that i could've literally exploded (hahah).But i didn't. Instead i turned this anger around into love. I send a prayer out, to all who are in pain caused by rape, murder or vengeance. I prayed for them, send love to em, love and understanding. There's always hope. There's good in everyone. This good is the divine light that shines within every soul, that lights up other souls surrounding. Doesn't matter if you believe in God, Allah or nothing at all. This love is all around us. It is what we are! So if you feel angry after this movie as well. Or frustrated, or in some other form of anguish or pain. Then go to that place inside of you, that place where its quiet and beautiful and peaceful. And feel the light, feel the love, and see your light illuminating this world. For it is this love that has always been here, its this love that shows us that there already is peace and forgiveness. All you have to do is embrace it.Namaste.",Hard Candy
536,vincent-schodolski,Who Wrote This First??,5,4 October 2008,"Okay I see that the screenplay carries the name Brian Wilson and I understand that ideas often morph in a writer's head and that two minds can have the same idea over time and that it is okay to borrow from previous works of fiction. All that said, i was left wondering when, after seeing ""Hard Candy"" some time ago I went on vacation and picked up a short story collection titled ""in between the sheets"" (lower case cq) by the British author Ian McEwan. The first story--""Pornography""--tells the tale of two women who begin the torture and simulated castration of a man who has wronged them after affairs. That story was first published in The New Review and then in 1978. So there is a difference in that the torturers are not 14 years old, but the essential idea is the same. I remember an old writing teacher told us to start with imitation with variation and so maybe that is all Mr. Nelson did, but a nod to McEwan--if he ever read him--would have been the gentlemanly thing to do.

538,andy_2-60-668673,Great performances tinted by hollowness,7,21 May 2015,"It takes one character to set the stage, and two to finish the job. Ellen Paige and Patrick Wilson, stars of ""Hard Candy"" deliver brilliant performances that enliven an interesting take on pedophilia.Consistency is evident in ""Hard Candy."" The film opportunities to prove itself a one-trick-pony, as its creative (albeit uncomfortable) subject matter makes room for, but superb performances from both Paige and Wilson drive the plot and prove that the raw relationship between protagonist and antagonist can spark consistent interest for more than ninety minutes.Throughout the dark, twisted story, audiences struggle to decide which character to root for, a self-conjuring mechanism that provides suspense and prevents the film from turning stale. Initially, the protagonist-antagonist scale shifts heavily towards one side, but audiences can't help but wonder deeper plot secrets that may indeed flip the scale reading entirely and the conflict-created fury along with it.That said, even with beautiful, satisfying performances throughout, the film just falls short of being memorable. The main reason is that it feels gimmicky, lacking that solid low end that encapsulates the greatness of classic films. The setting, misplaced musical scores – while exotic, just like the film's subject matter – brings with it a ""off"" mood that just doesn't connect with the story. While it seems outlandish to place such a standard for ""Hard Candy,"" the originality of its serious subject matter avoided by many directors certainly labels it a candidate.I give it seven stars for its ambition, cast, performance, but but hollow core.",Hard Candy
539,ecs-27756,Horrible film with anti-male agenda,1,23 January 2016,"This flick is horrible because of its very ""all men are evil and should be castrated"" theme, lack of fairness, unbelievable story line and poor ending. Basically, it is a bad story.Technically, the Filming and sound are very good. The acting is also good. It seems low budget with a short opening in a coffee shop but with the vast majority of the filming in a house in the hills overlooking LA. Almost all of the movie was shot with the two main actors with a few bit parts thrown in.Interesting premise, quality filming but with an unbelievable, political agenda driven story that is really horrible.

540,sharifgraham11,Gruesome,1,29 September 2006,"This was about the most uncomfortable, disturbing film I have seen in a long time. It has just been released in France (September, 2006). The acting was is places very good, even excellent, but making a 14-year-old into a brilliant revenge killer for a pedophile does not send an acceptable message. In fact, any male who sits through the castration scene could not possibly emerge with any empathy whatsoever for the girl! There is extreme moral confusion here, and the pedophile is actually a more sympathetic character than the girl. Even so, the movie lets her ""win"", and one can easily imagine a series of sequels in which she forces any number of evil men to do themselves in. Apparently, as with many other films, the idea of personal, extra-legal revenge still has appeal for some people, even though it represents reversion to a method a addressing evil which has caused untold suffering throughout human history. I maintain that the film is immoral as well as revolting. I advise my friends not even to think of seeing it. I don't think I have ever felt so strongly against a film in my life (I'm 64 years old).",Hard Candy
541,VinnyB83,Captivated & Thought Provoking,8,17 November 2006,"In the last few weeks I've visited the video store about 5 or 6 times and 2 or 3 of those times I've left without a film (mainly because i've either seen everything or everything seems sh**e. I went for a drink the other night and my friend Ant told me about this film called 'Hard Candy'. I told him that i'd seen it at the store but it didn't look like my kind of film. He went on to explain that it revolved around paedophilia. ""Well i definitely don't want to see it now then Ant"" i replied. ""trust me"" he said. ""It's good and it'll get you thinking"". The next day, after feeling a bit tired and a little drunk throughout the morning, i ventured down to the video store after work and my choice was either 'The Break-Up' or 'Hard Candy'. I thought why not get my friends recommendation, so i did. So here is my thoughts and theory on 'Hard Candy' Thought provoking, mentally stimulating, eye opening, cringing, twisting and turning are just some of the things that pop in to my mind....throughout the film and proceeding it. This film is simplistic in the way that it features 2 main characters and 1 set. However the dialogue is strong and effective, driving the film, producing the hook that keeps you watching. The acting is superb and the main question would be whether it is down to the young girl as to how good the film came across. Fortunately it all came together and we got a stimulating film. So what has the film got? Well it's got a modern 21st century look on one of the many problems we have in this world. Peodofilia is wrong and i think that this film did enough to project this. It was brilliant and cringing the way that she got her revenge for all people that have suffered. Cutting off his balls and getting him to hang himself is something that we all deep down wish all bad people in the world would do themselves. I think that this is an emotively deep and effecting film, carefully captured to give an entertaining perspective on our modern world. Whats sad is that our modern world, modern technology, is being used to amplify the bad things in our world. Internet chat rooms used by paedophiles could suggest the old theory that technology will eventually bite back at us. Although i will never watch this film again, it was a good tale and could be used as a story structure for many other problems in this world. I'd like to make a film about getting our own back on cold blooded murderers, rapists, thieves, and anyone else that rewinds all the good work that good people put in to our world.",Hard Candy

It is a movie about Hayley (more than excellent Ellen Page) and Jeff, about pedophilia and about how a pedophile must feel. Or maybe it is only a history of vengeance. You won't know until the end of the film. It sure is a difficult subject for a movie, but the script is excellently profiled in the psychological horror and does not turn to be obscene or anything than can visually or verbally hurt the sensibility of anyone. It is more like disturbing to hear a teenage girl speak how she does, and it is fascinating how your feelings will go from one character to the other during the movie until you realize that no matter what the end is, everyone is guilty of something and it is not to us, humans, to decide what bad actions can be justified by other bad actions.Try on it, and be open-minded.Sorry about any orthographic mistake, I'm not used to English writing.",Hard Candy

Especially on topics the movie is based around. Even without firsthand experience..empathy can go a long way. Positively and negatively. And wit that, there's balance. Two wrongs have never made a right and two rights are too underrated. We as humans, know what's right and what's wrong. No matter how many are punished for what they've put others through, many more will continue to be harmed, with or without them around. Many people deserve to get back exactly what they've given. And then some, most of the time. Yet, there are many ways of doing so. Ways that don't have to add onto your pain and hurt. What earned you your vengeance. It hurts and it enrages..but stooping to their level or lower, makes it all the worse. And just when you thought it couldn't get any worse. In the end, we all lose, when it comes to starting off the disregard for another human. Another living thing entirely. You bit hard, and either you get away with it, or you get bitten 10x harder..you never know how much pain your causing someone. Because while you may believe that it isn't your problem, it just may be the biggest one you'll ever regret causing for someone. Just like the monster is capable, so is the victim. Be aware of what you do and why you do it, when it comes to harming those who've never intended on doing so to you. They may do worse than you, in the end. Don't hurt the undeserved. It can backfire beyond belief. Your belief. We're human, but we all have met a monster at some point. Knowingly or unknowingly. They walk alongside human beings every single day. Why encourage more to come out? How could that possibly be enjoyable? I don't understand. I never will. This film reminded me of my life and honestly, my mindset. For years. The only difference with me on that matter is, I'm still human. I can't gain anything through harming others, as they've done me. Physically and mentally. I'm not them. Nor will I ever be anything close. It could drive you off the wall, the thought alone. No one's born afraid of nothing. Again...two wrongs don't make a right. Meaning, no one will win, in the end. The acting though, as well as the story line, very well done in my opinion. But of course, this can easily be found disturbing towards those who have been a subject to sexual abuse, forced sexual acts/sexual physical contact (I won't say the words. It even hurts and angers me more me to say them.) as well as having a loved you who has experienced any of these matters, in their own ways.",Hard Candy

You've never witnessed such passion captured in a 103 minutes video until you've watched this magnificent movie. I must bow to everyone who contributed to the making of such greatness, especially the young actor Ellen Page who seriously left me lost for words in describing her soaringly indescribable and heart-wrenching performance. Actors twice her age can never reach to her professionalism in her acting. A must-see movie whatever is you're beliefs or values. A movie that is bound to move you somehow.

Ignoring the fact that it's not good, just different.The biggest mistake is that the main theme of the film is muddled at best. The antagonists is supposed to be the ""good guy"", but is portrayed as the villain. The protagonists is in reality the ""monster"" but we are forced to care and worry about him.The movie runs through different situations to help understand the motives of the main character, but nothing is given to us to even care about her. This part was executed so horrible that most people wish ill on the good person.Also, the theme of this film is clear man vs. man (good vs. evil). However the way this is shown portrays good in an evil way. Which is evil vs. evil. Once again, no clear person to root for.Lastly. The direction was horrible. The movie is filled with extreme close ups, so extreme that for the most part you couldn't even see the entire head. This is the experimentation part that I mentioned early. It was rather sickly and annoying. I found it very annoying as did the rest of my friends.In conclusion, this movie was made for the shock factor and that's it.

After watching ""Hard Candy"" I felt a lot of the same feelings that I felt after watching Requiem. It is a hard movie to watch. Although looking at it from an obvious standpoint it looks like a movie about a little girl that takes revenge on pedophiles... I think there's a much, much deeper meaning in this film. I think that Haley is actually the villain in this film. Remember when she says that if a young girl imitates a woman then that is not an excuse to treat her as one? Well, what is she doing in the entire movie? She is imitating an adult, a very intelligent, rational adult that has fully understood all the complicated issues around child molestations and people that commit them. And she takes the ""law"" in her own hands and castrates him. Not only that but she makes him commit suicide under the condition that she will not let the world know that he was a pedophile. In the end we know that she lied to him and allowed him to commit suicide in order to make sure that it looked like he did it because he realized what a monster he was. So in other words she lied in order to make him do something that he would not have otherwise done. How is that different than what he did to little girls? I think that this movie is ultimately about the fact that taking this kind of revenge (fighting fire with fire), makes you the same person you seek to destroy.",Hard Candy

How wrong I was! The story moves along at a gripping pace, the cinematography is beautiful (simple and complex simultaneously. A perfect balance.) The acting is very believable. I think anyone would enjoy this film, as the audience I saw it with was a mixture of people from a number of different socioeconomic backgrounds and everyone seemed to like what they saw. The only aspect of the film that worries me is that the main character is going to be viewed as a sort of embodiment of an angry, man hating feminist, rather than a girl who is on a mission to erase the horrors of pedophilia. The people I saw it with agreed that they were nervous that the film will only reinforce cultural attitudes about feminist as man hating, psycho bitches, which is simply a generalization.

This is basically a teen movie that leaves you questioning nothing except the purpose of the filmthe entire movie was about a 14 year old who captures and tortures a pedophile. You would expect that for a movie which is filmed entirely in one house with 2 characters, that some effort would be placed on developing complex and interesting characters and interactions between them, but this does not occur. Basically the girl tortures the pedophile the entire time and cracks jokes. The only thing we learn about the Haley, the 14 year old girl, is how witty she is.I recommend that if anybody wants to see good movie about a woman torturing a rapist, see the movie Death and the Maiden.

If after 20 or 30 minutes you are not totally captivated, just turn off the TV.That said, I REALLY enjoyed this movie. It wasn't pleasant in any way. I don't know when I'll be able to smile properly again. It prompted some very uncomfortable flashbacks and made me squirm. I watched it alone in complete darkness at four in the morning. It was terrifying. I love it when a movie is scary without being ""bloody and gross"" and this movie is my new standard of that quality. It freaked me out, but at no point did it make me queasy. I LOVED it.This film is disturbing and morally ambiguous. There is no happy ending. There is no character to really fully empathize with; if you need well defined ""hero"" and ""antagonist"" and ""victim"" characters, don't go near this film.The film is not meant as an endorsement of the acts of its characters, and anyone who is offended by a film that may ""seem to support"" blah blah blah should not bother.This movie was made under major budget constraints, the format is really simple, and the camera work is intense and far from mainstream. Much of the plot is seriously implausible and there are continuity issues. I wasn't bothered by this, I was too busy trying in vain to figure out what would happen next. However, if you prefer a movie to be more ""reasonable"" watch a different movie.Also, if you are easily irritated by someone attacking someone else with self-righteous, witty verbal lashings, don't even bother.On the plus side, the acting is excellent. Ellen Page's facial expressions are impeccable throughout her performance... subtle but accurate. This film stays with you, it's subtleties take a long time to filter out of the viewers brain.If my above description makes this sound like the worst movie ever made, don't watch it.

Right from the beginning I thought it was awkward and it just went all downhill from there. There was absolutely no character development. The whole movie made me angry, now I just want to punch every 14 year old kid in the face. Just as I thought it couldn't get worse, it did. Many times. There was one good part in this whole movie; When it ended. People say ""I was hooked,"" I don't know how you could say that I was begging my girlfriend to change the channel. Watching a 32 year old man beg for mercy for half the movie tends to get old fast. Like I said, I love a good horror movie, but I really didn't want to see a castration then the stupid girl put his balls in a garbage disposal.

The protagonist is a teen girl, and the film makes reference to this not being the first time she has taken on a criminal who somehow escaped the justice system. With its reception being somewhat controversial, I think this film expertly accomplishes its objective; creating a shocking and thought provoking piece that addresses the horrific problem of pedophilia and how often handsome and charming perpetrators are given leeway and greater sympathy than victims.

That made no friggin sense."" This movie is unbelievable, the actress overacts her part, and the pedophile is such a complete friggin idiot/moron I can't even understand it. Seriously, who crawls at someone with a scalpel in plain sight. I found that more funny and sad then suspenseful. And the Circumcision, how did she know he was going to escape? The bonds were obviously not meant to let him escape or he would've successfully done it the first time. There's no real hero in the movie, just an villain, who they try and make you sympathize, and an anti-hero, who's more sadistic then anything else. For those of you who haven't seen this movie, let me put up a rough synopsis.1. Girl and guy setting up meeting in person over instant messenger. (thats right, the first five minutes of character development is all instant messenging...WOO....) 2. Girl and guy meet up for coffee and you have to think this is the dumbest girl ever.3. Girl talks the guy into going back to his place to listen to some stupid no name band.4. After drinking the girl slips the guy a roofie and ties him up(thats where they present the fact he's some kind of child molester/kiddie porn peddler) 5. Guy tied to a rolling chair, watches as girl rambles for what seems like ever finally getting to the conclusion she's going to trash his house looking for evidence against him.6. During the search girl finds a loaded gun under the bed and sets it on top.7. She finds his safe and gets the combination, the guy watches as she opens it and when she gets close enough he kicks her in the head. (the scene is so ridiculous looking I couldn't stop laughing. Its sorta like in anchorman where jack black punts baxter.8. Guy grabs gun but as soon as he gets...sorry, rolls back into the living room she is nowhere to be found.9. Girl jumps out of dark corner w/saran wrap and suffocates him mob-style while he misses with just one shot. (you think the neighbours down the block would here) 10. Girl ties him to table and tells him she's going to castrate him. This is where i see the funniest acting face in all my life. Check out the guys look when she's explaining it to him.11. During the long and drawn out scene(a lot of these in this movie) the guy is ""castrated."" She leaves him saying she's going to go take a shower and then leave forever.12. OK, now the guy somehow musters the strength to escape the table and guess what? She had only put a binderclip over his balls! It was all a ruse. Wow, I didn't know binderclips felt like castration. Anyways..13. Guy grabs a scalpel off the table and heads to the shower to um...lacerate her.14. Oh my god a step ahead of him again! Somehow she was hiding behind the door with a tazer. Personally if it were me i would've escaped before I thought i'd been castrated...but thats just me.15. Anyway, she goes and uses the phone after she zaps him in the tub but you see her walking around and this guy is in plain view, crawling (very pathetically by the way) down the hall towards her. No joke, its the dumbest looking thing i've ever seen.16. So she tazers him again and he passes out.17. Next thing we know he's hanging from the ceiling and she's telling him if he kills himself she'll destroy the evidence he found. He proceeds to mount/strangle her and escapes from the noose. He grabs a nice and chases her onto the roof where she says she's called his long lost love and if he hangs himself(conveniently a noose on the roof too), she'll destroy all the evidence and his old girl won't know jack.18. You know what the guy does? He hangs himself? Its the worst ending to a movie ever. You never find out what the girls real name is, she just wanders off in this red pseudo-red riding hood outfit. Only time you see it in the whole movie. This is a film which should've definitely been left for Lifetime. Only the bipolar could truly appreciate it. Anyways, hope you enjoyed my review. Please god, don't watch this.",Hard Candy
567,u-lya,Crazy reality,10,29 November 2006,"It's so unexpected... Everything happens so fast that it gives you no time to realize what is REALLY going on. Every scene brings even more confusion and a sort of frustrating feeling that the viewer is left outside the story. But that makes this movie a brilliant piece... It doesn't offer a piece of reality or answers. Just facts, action, a crazy carousel that goes faster and faster and faster to the point in which nobody knows WHEN, HOW or IF it will stop. Maybe this is life eventually: total monotony until one day when destiny hits you so bad that it gives you no time to make preparations... Don't think that you are ready for anything, because nobody really is. C'est la vie! Enjoy watching!!",Hard Candy
568,iantempleton,Worst I've seen in 2006!,2,28 June 2006,"I read the reviews which slated it, yet still I thought, ""yeah, this should be good!"" Not so. The source material and idea should allow for a better film. Yes the dialogue was awkwardly creepy, but that's all it had going for it. Too many important things to the movie couldn't be shown, which for me made it look censored, and yeah of course I understand why they weren't shown. When he's being castrated, you just know that there must be more to the film, and you expect some kind of twist. The twist if it was one wasn't very original. And the director thought because he'd learnt some stylish techniques at film school, such as shaky cameras and that multiple frame shooting that he had to use them. It just added to how far fetched and ultimately unrealistic the film was. I mean, the castration yes, but so premeditated over the internet by a 14 year old, I think not!",Hard Candy
569,gonzo-carl,Terrible,1,17 June 2006,"When I saw the trailer, I thought ""that really does look like the most terrible film in ages"". Then my friends female companion decided she wanted to see it, and i was dragged along for the ride. And I was right.The sheer terribleness of it found me wishing both the characters would simply spontaneously combust and die. There was no soundtrack, it was all just talking, and awkward silences. Maybe this was to be dramatic, but it came across as excessively annoying.Whether this review was helpful or not to you, I'm not sure. I just needed to get this off my chest. I want the 2 hours i spent watching that film back Gonzo xXxXx",Hard Candy
570,nick-entwistle,A must see recommendation.....,9,17 June 2006,"This film was simply brilliant.A very difficult subject matter was handled in a manner that did not glorify, glamorise or trivialise. It forces the viewer to consider contemporary issues in a way you may not otherwise approach the topic. There are however moments of (dark black) comedy which lend some light relief to a serious psychological drama.The aesthetics of the cinematography are first rate. A great use of colour and tightly cropped shooting adding to the tension provided by the subject matter and script.The acting is superb - Ellen Page deserves an Oscar for her performance, and Patrick Wilson's is equally accomplished.Do not be put off by the reviews suggesting this is a difficult film to watch. There are no graphic scenes in terms of what you see, the Director successfully inducing discomfort without the need for gratuitous filming.This film kept me glued to the screen for it's duration. Towards the end it is pulled together in a very satisfactory manner, whilst at the same time leaving something open to the viewers interpretation.",Hard Candy
571,zibba66,a horror movie dressed up in art-house clothing,1,18 June 2006,"I was looking forward to seeing this - about the only decent thing on in the movies in June - but was very disappointed.The movie is stuffed full of improbabilities (mostly related to the unbelievable skills of a 14year old and her strength compared to that of a grown man). The close-up style certainly makes for (pleasing) uncomfortable watching but then the pudding is over-egged with the other effects (speeded up/slowed down action; changes in colour, shaky effects etc).The potential questions raised about victim/villain and what exactly is paedophilia are never addressed (despite what other glowing reviews might say) and what we are left with is a movie that is nothing more than a horror movie that is trying to be far to clever for it's own good.A real disappointment when you bear in mind that the topic of the movie should have provided for a really thoughtful and suspense-filled challenge to our notions of young girls and adult men.",Hard Candy
572,info-8991,Brilliant!!!! Acting was amazing Humour was Amazing Story was Amayzing,10,18 June 2006,"I've honestly never felt so taken back by a film as I have with Hard Candy. For starters I have never posted a comment on a film before but this film was so brilliant that I just have to say something about it.Firstly the Screenplay and Script were exceptional I've become so bored with films that have a character that is so easy to sway. Use a little reverse psychology on them on there they go, it all changes and at one point I truly thought that that was going to happen with this film. (the part when Jeff tries to manipulate Hailey with thoughts that she has been neglected by her family). However it's very quickly steered in the total opposite direction when Hailey decides she's having none of it.Later on in the film in what I shall call the ""Snip Scene"" a lot of clever humour is used in a very twisted and sick way, yet it still has you laughing out loud and really shows you how twisted this 14yr old girl is and how familiar she is to been in this situation. This scene really lets the directors talent shine and you can see that the humour used really brings an added intensity to it and a lot of the time makes you think ""should I really be laughing at this"" The ending is another clever piece of work showing just how well Hailey's plans have worked and how well thought out and the entire incident is. And she gets what's she's after for Jeff truly show what he is a Sick Minded Paedophile that deserves everything that comes to him, including been led into a false sense of security that every thing will work out for him if he excepts what he has done is wrong and pays the ultimate price of ending his own life, and to then never find out about what Hailey's real plans are.Once again I thought this film was very clever, well acted and well directed. It was almost quite artistic in places and slick and as a whole very enjoyable. Well Done",Hard Candy
573,calton_,Don't waste your time on this.,1,24 December 2019,"Literally the worst movie I've ever seen.
The director was probably doing for a ""scandalous"" and ""provocative"" but it turned out to just be boring, poorly executed and overall horrible. The acting, the story, the motives - everything is as bad as it gets.",Hard Candy
574,karla13-1,Disturbingly Clever,7,19 June 2006,"I went into this film knowing little, if nothing about it. The only insight I had was it was a ""single white female"" kind of film. Well, it isn't anything like that. It is cleverly written, disturbingly so. However, I couldn't help thinking that maybe there was too little script for this film. If you lost a good quarter of this film you'd have lost nothing.However, the acting carried this film all the way through. Don't get me wrong, the script was a thought provoking concept but the weight of the actors really made this worth a watch. Ellen Page will be credited for her role I expect by everyone who is to write a review. But you cannot dismiss Patrick Wilson's performance either who is unlucky to be slightly over-shadowed by his teen wonder co-star. He truly does fill you with the fear he is feeling.Funny that the above review mentioned Sigourney Weaver because that was my first thought with the incredible Ellen Page. She is not your typical Hollywood actress and I sincerely hope she continues straying slightly from this path. A true delight to watch.So, in a nut shell. Am I glad I watched it. Yes! It's not one of those films that leaves you wondering why you wasted 2 hours of your life you're never getting back. But will I watch it again? No. Glad I saw it, but once was enough.",Hard Candy
575,Kat_Raby,Good in a way but up to you!,7,19 June 2006,"Well, what can i say...i saw the trailer for this film and i absolutely loved it, it was different to other films and looked as though it could challenge some of the other psychological ""thrillers"" that had been released but i had to wait a week for it to be released and was getting really excited for when it was, I went to see it the day it came out but at the end of the film i felt really disappointed. The majority of the films best bits were in the trailer and nothing much was left in the film. For most of the film you had to think about what was happening because the cameras rotated the actors and not their actions so it was left to our imaginations, now i don't have a problem with my imagination but some of my friends did and really found it difficult to follow the plot/ story line but even with the use of our imagination the film was also limiting us because of the actors body language and script lines. On the other hand i do have to say that even though the film consisted of mainly two characters for the majority it, they did work well together which would normally in a film ruin it but it had a well thought out script but the film lacked......well see for yourself!",Hard Candy
576,mrtin0142,This could have been a good movie,1,10 December 2011,"But it's not! The characters in this movie are laughable and unrealistic and the girls character is so obnoxious and unrealistic (did i say that twice) that you instantly start to sympathize with the supposed child molester. The whole scenario is just not believable. The girl behaves and talk like an adult and the whole setting feels artificial. The girl is actually the cold calculating psychopath here, and there is nothing about her or her story (what story?) to explain or make you sympathize with her actions. I guess the movie makers thought a role reversal would be interesting or controversial somehow. But it's not. It needs something more. It just doesn't work because the girl character is so utterly unlikable that every time she opens her mouth you wish the pedophile would find some way to shut this preachy psychopath up and get the hell out of there. It can't possibly be good when a movie leads you to get so annoyed by one of the characters that you start to side with the pedophile.The movie does not explore any controversial issues about teen sexuality, conflicting emotions of pedophiles or any conflicting feelings the victim, who herself turned into a molesting psychopath, may encounter, and it doesn't make you think or challenge you in any other way. You feel like your just listening to an ultraconservative adult preaching morality through an actor portraying a 14 year old actor throughout the movie. In addition to all this the movie is just plain boring. Nothing happens, to much pretentious dialogue and no suspense whatsoever. Yet, the concept has potential. This could have been a good movie.DON'T WATCH!",Hard Candy
577,ben-videovision,Hard pressed to remember the last time I saw such a good film.,10,21 June 2006,"This film should have the kind of longevity enjoyed by films like RearWindow and its ilk. There's superb acting throughout and I look forward to seeing more from Jeff (Patrick Wilson) and Hayley (Ellen Page), as well as the director, David Slade. He should be very pleased with the slickness of this film, and the evident skill used to put it together. Rarely does a film leave you gripping the edge of your seat an hour after it's finished.Far surpassing Fatal Attraction as a film, it will enter in to popular culture in much the same way. I wonder what its alternative to ""bunny boiler"" will be.Watching this film will leave you squirming, flinching and tense, but very satisfied by two solid hours of thrilling entertainment. It also has a very special message for all the paedophiles out there.",Hard Candy
578,princessdawnofbearcreek,Of course she was a monster,10,2 October 2006,"Interesting I watched this film within a week of a school shooting in Colorado in which girls were isolated, sexually abused, and one killed, and on the same day that a man walked into an Amish school, again isolated girls, and killed at least three.Was Hayley a monster? Yes. Were her actions horrifying? Of course they were. But who made her that way? We women didn't make the world; we just live in it. And sadly, we live in a world in which there are some men who do terrible things. Watch the news. It's enough to excite the monster that lurks in all of us. ""Cut his nuts off"" is a common response when we see stories of pedophiles and child murderers. It's a common response from men and women. In this story, somebody actually did it--or at least faked it.There is no ""side"" to pick in this film, except the side that wonders how society produces either of these people and how sad it is in both cases.",Hard Candy
579,mugwumpbuttonlover,wow you lot have a lot to say well so do i!!,8,27 June 2006,well i just watched hard candy and i admit i had a confused feeling about me so i came onto IMDb to see what everybody else thought!! i think this film has done what is was made to do..made you all stop an think about how you feel on this topic! i had a lot of sympathy for the girl Hailey but still whatever it was she faced in the past it gave her no right to take this problem an solve it in her own way and Jeff well i have to say i wasn't convinced she was right about him but sure enough the fact that we don't know what anyone is capable of is proved in this film who would have thought an adolescent girl could treat another human being in this way an as for teens not being of strong enough mind to know whats happening this is true in many cases but not in all I'm not saying that doing this to a child is right but i do think that there's a lot more to it i also think that the fact that you took the time to post a comment about the way you felt says a lot about you an others shouldn't be so quick to reply with silly cyber squabble!! anyway i thought this film was interesting to watch although a little disturbing no blood an goor but i thought what they replaced that with was harder to stomach the looks dialogue camera shots were awesome great piece of movie making just a very controversial topic but this is what makes them money!! p.s does anyone think that she maybe the abducted girls relative it crossed my mind!!,Hard Candy
580,karol-elmore,"A captivating, updated ""Hitchcock"" type drama/thriller.",9,4 November 2006,"I didn't think I was going to like this film from seeing the trailers, and even as it began. I assumed I already knew the predictable plot. I was wrong. It was intense and uncomfortable to watch, but I soon realized it was brilliant how it kept ""twisting"" and I couldn't tell where it was actually going all the way to the end. During the whole movie, it was hard to discern which of the characters were going to be ""good"" or ""evil"" or what their motives were. Even when it was over, it left a lot of questions in my mind. It reminds me of a Hitchcock film, with an updated plot. The actors were incredible -- their characters were very believable at all times. One might think it would be boring with so much dialog between just two characters in one basic location and yet I found it captivating. I never doubted for a moment that Ellen Page was a 14 year old girl. This is not a ""feel good"" movie, and I guarantee you will not easily forget it. I highly recommend it.",Hard Candy

582,ppmmzz,Hard Candy,9,28 July 2006,First off I would like to state that I've been using IMDb for the past 3 years and only became a registered member because of a user's comments stating it was unrealistic and a bad acted. I want to say right now Hard Candy is probably the second best movie i've seen this year. I started watching the movie at about 3AM and was feeling really tired. Needless to say i was up until 5AM with eyes wide open and a dropped jaw. This is the first realistic movie i've seen in a long time and would like to say that it was so powerful it made me a IMDb registered member. I think this is a good movie for parents who don't really use the internet to see what kind of things people do on the internet and what could happen. The movie may of went one way but it could always go the other way.,Hard Candy
583,beeswax_l_polymerwick,Best movie I never saw,4,28 July 2006,"The first 45 minutes of Hard Candy was riveting and thrilling. Then it takes a hard turn for the worst into gratuitous horror and cheap suspense. This film further lowers the bar for unnecessary scenes depicting sexual violence and mutilation as a cheap substitute for quality writing and cinematography. It was sad to watch this one throw itself onto the rubbish heap. We walked out early on Hard Candy.This film was a little like IMDb's ten lines of text rule. If you don't have a ninety minute movie, go back and add some scenes from the Three Faces of Death's cutting room floor. We hope Lion's Gate reaps enough profit from the 4 million dollar gem to hire a screenwriter next go around.",Hard Candy
584,omulurimaru,"disturbing! well acted, but disturbing!",1,1 August 2006,"I checked out the other comments for this movie and expecting a real psychological drama I decided to watch it. The movie was indeed quite disturbing from the very beginning. A 30 something old guy meeting with a 14 years old girl who actually looks like a boy. I mean... How sick can one be? Well, the ones who made this film were very sick! Not only it's about a pedophile, it's about a pedophile getting tortured by a 14 year old girl and then committing suicide being blackmailed by this girls who apparently has done this kind of stuff before. Now... does that sound realistic to you? Of course not! Now, I want to get this very clear the acting is marvelous, the directing quite good and the plot has some interesting twists. But from time to time one gets the impression that this is some kind of test in psychology for a really sick audience to solve! Well I'm not that sick audience that this movie is looking for. And I sincerely believe that these movie will be fully enjoyed by sadistic persons. So if you are a God-fearing Church-going tax-paying good citizen, don't waist your time with this movie, it's not worthy, it's too disturbing.On the other hand if you're a pedophile or a potential pedophile or maybe just somebody who fantasizes about this kind of stuff, WATCH it! You'll have a lot to learn from it about the consequences of your actions. By the way, you know they say one ends up in hell if they commit suicide. So this is a pretty strong message towards pedophiles that the movie transmits.On the other hand it's a movie that a sadistic person will love and will get euphoric about. That's about as disturbing as the message.",Hard Candy

586,divajulia_4,Loved this movie!!,10,27 September 2006,"I was prepared to like this movie due to its content because my own childhood trauma. However, I wasn't prepared to LOVE it. It was so engagingly well written. Some may argue that a 14 year old girl isn't ""smart enough"" to pull of what Haley does, but I beg to differ. Looking in the not too distant past, i.e. Columbine, boys are ""smart enough"" to pull off horrific crimes in ""real life"", right? This one might be fiction...but it was certainly was thrill to see a pedophile get what he deserved--even if it was only fictional. Both characters were solid, yet mysterious. Some may not to know who to ""side with"" at times...although, I never wavered from Haley. She was captivating, innocent, terrifying, childish, jaded, and absolutely insane...and totally sane. What do YOU think?",Hard Candy
587,mattalexxpub,"Great movie, but My God what a horrible ending!",6,27 August 2006,"This movie kept me on my toes for its entire length. I loved it.But why the hell would a man swallow his shame in front of a barbaric, troubled teenager and KILL HIMSELF, simply to avoid exposure? I put myself in his shoes, balanced my options, and came out with a completely different outcome.She couldn't have screwed with his head enough to force suicide. Not in that short of a time.I'm not a pedophile and I think that guy was completely guilty, but so was the girl.

At the same time, you have to ask yourself, ""does he deserve it?"" It was the most fascinating piece of film involving a young girl and a child molester I have ever seen. The whole time you may think ""did he do it?"" Or you may think he didn't do it at all and this girl is just crazy. Well, she is a bit crazy, but that's besides the point. The tables have turned - on him. Could a 14 year old girl really be twisted enough to do such a thing as feign castration? In the old days it was, after all, the punishment for rape/adultery. In addition to the story, which I thought was incredibly original and smart, I really liked the look of the film. The blue tones really gave it a mood to suit the story. It looked real, sort of like a documentary. But sharper with great lines and colour. Great movie. I actually find it strange that more men gave it a higher score than women did.",Hard Candy

590,skdragon-1,Gave up on it,4,6 September 2006,"Not a bad movie. (Warning, spoilers ahead). The movie went downhill after the girl traps the guy and ties him up. This happens within the firs ten minutes. He knows he is in trouble and he tries to get out of it, and with one kick she is down and hurt. Why someone who is tied up and now has an advantage would not continue to kick their assailant until they are sure there is no threat seems a little strange, but it allows the rest of the plot to continue. This combined with the rest of the dialog led me to watch only half the movie. Stuff like the girl asking the guy questions, and expecting answers, but she is wearing headphones that are turned on so she can't hear the answer, come on!?! If you can pass over this kind of thing in a movie, like most movies these days seem to contain, then you can enjoy a good show I suppose. I had better things to watch ...",Hard Candy

The movie has only 2 characters and 2 scenes, with dialogue that keeps you gripped and characters so dynamic the plot never reaches a cliché moement. While such simplicity may suggest amateur work, this is by no mean amateur. The cinematography is excellent, maxamizing the simplistic settings for a variety of thrilling shots. This is the most relevant film an entire generation of youth should see, even though rated R, mostly for language not graphic content.

592,monzu,Never under estimate your intended victim,8,7 October 2006,"This is a movie, with, what , for some, may be difficult subject matter. The reason it works is due to three things. Outstanding casting of the two principals, a very smart script and the fact that it is handled masterfully by the director and the other crafts people involved. Their attention to detail in camera work, lighting, set work and editing, combined with stellar performances by the actors involved make this film far more engaging and gripping than it might have been in less skillful hands. The script lulls the viewer into a mild complacency about the story arc, despite the subject, until the sudden shift in the power dynamic between the characters. At that point, the movie truly becomes compelling and all the artistry involved is brought clearly into focus, primarily because the viewer's attention becomes riveted by what's going on, and because the camera work is very tightly crafted, so the intensity of the on screen action is heightened considerably. Actress Ellen Page did an amazing job with the roll. This movie is intense, intelligent and compelling. It should draw comment for both the subject matter and the artistry involved in making it.",Hard Candy
593,cozypill-1,engrossing & disengaging at once,6,18 November 2006,"Conniving and arrogance are the main words that come to mind while viewing Hard Candy, and as the film progresses, a feeling of detachment from the characters also succumbs. These are the main feeling one might experience after watching this film.Hard Candy just barley touched the surface of the genre; thriller, I would class this film as a on-the-verge-thriller. The story could have gone much deeper into the minds and lives of 'Hayley Stark' & 'Jeff Kohlver' - we needed a small glimpse of their somewhat troubled history, prior to their meeting online. Basically, a mature adult male, 'abducted' in(to) his own pad by a sugar sweet teenybopper? No mystery there. Listening to Hayley was actually like listening to a 14 year old, she wasn't mature at all, just arrogant and narrow minded. The monologue blabbing of this girl was painful - shut up!.Ultimately, the characters are too uninteresting, we know as much about them as cardboard box. I can appreciate the enigmatic side of the character's to some degree, but I was asking too may questions at the final scene. Uh, who are these people? An outcome, of some sort just did not exist.The filming needed to break out Jeff's pad, like in The Vanishing (1993), for example, open spaces are sometimes more claustrophobic and thrilling than a slick apartment, Somehow, the story needed to break out of Jeff's place, I think an intense showdown needed to occur, perhaps a cliff etc, would have made a great backdrop for the final scenes. Either way, there needed to be an intense life-death struggle outside of the House.Judy Tokuda (Sandra Oh) was far to polite and blasé as the nosy neighbour, obviously, Judy knew something was up - the alarm bells were ringing, I do not understand why she wasn't brought into the storyline more, sure, Jeff probably has girls around his place from time to time, but I feel she did not go on her instincts that something was no right. This scene between Judy and Hayley, was an important time in the film:- an unexpected interruption, that caught Hayley off guard, this moment in the film was rather suspenseful, it could have been a real turning point, but unfortunately, did not go in the right direction. My opinion is, a third party needed to somehow be present i.e.: Judy Tokuda (Sandra Oh).Visually, Hard Candy is a treat to the eyes, with ultra modern set-design and sophistication. Cinematography and effects an important part of Hard Candy. The low key ambiance of the film score and music inclusions really went a long way in regards to setting up the overall dark mood for the film. Also, LFO's 'Freak' was the perfect track, creating an intoxicating, acidic and sickly feeling. 'Freak' sums up Hard Candy - Fast paced and full on, sickly and engrossing till the end.Overall, an entertaining film for the most part, but ultimately lacking plot direction, third party involvement & frankly, basic human compassion.Alternatively, I suggest the following films, certainly not as stylish or slick but more intense: Terror in the Night (94) (Directed by Colin Bucksey) & The Vanishing (93) (George Sluizer) are just to that come to mind.",Hard Candy

I was told by friends I might like this one, but once I saw the Lionsgate logo, I knew I was in for the usual 2 hours of gratuitous torture. If watching someone get tortured and humiliated during a story full of plot holes you can drive a truck through, then by all means, check it out and enjoy. That is if you can see anything. The director is another one of those music video kids who thinks shooting extreme close-ups adds tension. Maybe in the hands of a Craven or Carpenter this could have been interesting.

598,veronicar_3773,A truly frightening film,8,6 February 2007,"First I have to say that reading some of the comments about the film made me more sick than the plot. It simply frightened me to know there are such ignorant people ready to write a review when they can't even grasp the plot.This is a surprisingly disturbing film driven by two characters. To engage the audience with 2 people on the screen is a challenge and it is done here with skill and creativity. I will add here that I did not think that this 14 year old was on a ""random"" vigilante mission. Rather her strength and resolve seem to come from an intimate knowledge of the pedophiles victim (perhaps sisters). Haley plays the part so well as to imply that she had done her homework, knew for certain the targets guilt and carried out her plan with no intention of failing. This is a calculated plot and she anticipates every plea from her ""victim"" with a shrewed humor. She knows him, she has waited to enact this revenge and her age (14) means nothing if in fact she had suffered the loss of a sibling and had to endure the monstrous reality of pedophilia and sadistic torture and murder. This is no innocent child but a young girl who needs to avenge a wrong no matter what the cost. I loved that you are not spoon fed any of this and that the film is open to interpretation. but to say that you can ""identify"" with the pedophile in leue of her actions is beyond disturbing. And some of the comments above prove to frighten me even more about the people that lurk in cyber space.",Hard Candy

The poor guy got his twig and berries mangled because of some mentally deranged little girl.

Some people are mature at 14, some are never mature enough for a serious sexual relationship. People are animals acting out of basic drives, need for food, sex, etc. This will NEVER change. You may not like it, personally, and call it ""sick"". But the things you DO like may be viewed as ""sick"" by someone else. It's JUST a movie.

After all, when was the last time you picked up a magazine or newspaper and the headlines were about something good that happened? When I was 14 I had a terrific sexual relationship with a 22 year-old. Was it wrong? It sure didn't feel wrong. Did we suffer dire consequences?

It is rather what is not displayed.

I am not sure how this is possible given that this is the point of the movie - well, it does not really have a point, but this is what this 'film' allegedly tries to explore (without, I might add coming to any conclusion or a hint of thereof). when you watch the preview for this chef d'oeuvre, it sets up an intrigue of older man meeting a younger girl of in the net. interesting. here is a preview of this the trailer omits: a crazed teenager trying to cut the testicles of an alleged offender for about half an hour. A Saturday night killer (and by that I mean your Saturday night).

Another thought that i have abt him is that he didnt want to admit to himself that he was a bad guy, its like he wanted to hide that part of him. Also later in the movie he asks if she was stalking him and she responded that he went in other chat rooms and talked with w her but different name and he would drop them as soon as he knew they were older then her. Alot of people say she was asking for it . I was watching it w my friend and she said how she was asking for it but the thing is this the point. She was filtering w him to get to his house.

Who in their right mind could ever condole a 14-year-old girl on a power trip, castrating a man because she feels it is the right thing to do?! Goodness!

""The vigilante knows it is not vengeance they seek, nor even some lending of respectability to the spirit of vengeance. The vigilante is no avenger. The vigilante simply wants punishment, or just deserts, and they want it swift and sure. The only problem is that vigilante justice is sometimes too swift and too sure.

There are a few shots out of focus that fit incredibly. Oh, I loved it. Plus, the actress, Ellen Page, is a real promise.

611,diorite17,Next Level,10,18 November 2006,"Being a father of a 14 year old girl. This movie had a great impact on me. In the beginning I came very close to scrapping the movie, because I thought, ""Here we go, another Hollywood deal on giving the pedophile more rights, and a soft couch to go with it."" Hard to watch these type of movies when you have a teenage girl growing in todays world, with our vast communication systems. So already I was upset at the onset. But when the scene of him acting like he was on a date rape drug, I thought , what is this , are the tables being turned, then my interest really peaked here. Normally, you can expect some underlying message in all of Hollywood's movies. Trying to push a certain agenda on people. Whether we like it or not. Not once did I feel any pity for the character of the pedophile. No matter how you cut it, he is a pedophile. For once, the agenda was on the side of the 14 year girl. When I said next level in summary, what I mean by that , is the punishment of castration, for committing sex crimes against our children, should be a automatic sentence in society today. Not through drugs, but surgically. There would be greatly reduced chance of repeat offenders getting a another crack at the bat, so to speak. From 75% down to 2%. They would be forced to stop and think, exactly what happens to them when they are caught. We definitely know they are not thinking about the well being of the child. That thought process does not exist. I think it is safe to say that much, most people can agree on that. The act is strictly selfish, much like suicide. If John Couey was castrated, Jessica would probably be alive today.My hat is off to the producers of this movie, it was written very well, and it makes all of us think where we should draw the the line on this issue. It is time for society to say enough is enough , and have enough guts to put our children's safety ahead of these people's rights.Jim Westcott",Hard Candy

It was a scary look into the web of deceit most people will create, to feed their insanity. While believing their insanity is justified and/or hide-able.

I have seen it twice, plus viewed the actors comments. 1st time I saw it I found it very disturbing,and just wasn't sure how I felt about it. The very end helped when Jeff asked Hayle twice who she was. From her answer I put kind of a spiritual angle to it. Kind of like a highway to heaven avenging angel type thing. When film was over I said to myself, well, not great, but good---I gave it 3 of 5 stars. Throughout the next day I was aware of a strange thing----I could not get this movie out of my mind. It nagged at me. Couldn't say why. But I decided to watch it a second time. This time around did it for me. I don't want spoilers here, so I'll just say that there were 1 or 2 things I missed the 1st time. But what I liked most was just the incredible acting of Hayley. This movie is like a good piece of music. You get into more than the words to the song, you love that drum or guitar. They make the song as much or more than the words. This movie is like that.

Moreover, the movie is filled with numerous unrealistic moments, for instance a 14 year old girl is able to overpower a grown man 3 times, even though he had a gun at one point. Another absurd thing is how he was able to untie himself from the kitchen table after the supposed castration, but when his testicles were about to get loose he somehow lost that ability. At one point I was just annoyed at the constant impossible events just popping one after the other.On the other hand, the plot is cunning and original and the acting is good, but the development is absolutely nonsensical and the action improbable.In conclusion, the movie is worthwhile although personally I did not enjoy most of it.",Hard Candy

624,gunnutbs,Internet prey becomes real-life predator in this story of an underage girl who turns the tables on an older man she met online.,2,8 January 2007,"Here is a movie that tries a new twist on a contemporary cliché; an older man meets a teenage girl online and meets her, but in this tale the girl goes on the offensive. She attacks him to avenge the acts of pedophilia she assumes he's committed before, creating a long interaction that fills-in the plot details as it progresses.First, let me say that I hesitate to malign anything that involves Ellen Page because I really adore and admire her. She's my new favorite celebrity at the moment, which is the reason why I ordered this DVD and watched it. I like her so much that I'm tempted to be very tender in commenting on this film, but unfortunately I can't be. The two main actors, Ellen Page and Patrick Wilson, turn in marvelous performances; however, even their excellent work can't repair a poorly constructed and badly developed plot. My praise for these 2 actors is the only positive comment I can offer.The problem with the film is that it develops its plot very slowly, and references off-plot events very obliquely. It is only fairly late in the movie that we learn about the real motivations of the young girl-turned-avenger, and even then this aspect of the story is never fully explained. It turns out that she is not really trying to lash out at a random internet predator for some unspecified previous crimes; rather, she has a very specific revenge in mind. The problem is that it hints at other events outside the film that we don't see, involving characters we don't meet, even though they seem to be important. The effect is that the viewer never quite feels he's getting the whole story, and never really feels like he's engaged with the main plot line quite yet.Frequent reference is made to the male character's long-lost childhood girlfriend, but we never really meet her (her face is only shown briefly at the very last moment in the film). Also frequently mentioned is an earlier crime in which some other teenage girl was a victim, although we never see her or get the full explanation of that event, either. This film doesn't even use the classic ""flashback"" or ""daydream"" techniques to show events or people outside the plot...they just remain referenced but unseen. Their importance is suggested but never explained. By the end of the movie, you have a basic understanding of these off-plot events you didn't see and people you didn't meet...but it comes only at the very end, and it leaves you wondering why you watched the whole movie just to get that little bit of information.Another reason this film fails is the extended scenes of physical struggle between the two main characters. It just isn't believable. Sure, it's possible in real-life that a girl can beat up a man or even score a lucky punch every now and then...but the notion that a 90-pound teenager can repeatedly subdue a grown adult man just becomes absurd. The scenes go through so many permutations and go on for so long, always with the petite female firmly in command, that it just passes a point of believability.Infatuated as I am with Ellen Page, it pains me to rate this movie so poorly...but I must. It was worth it, though, just to watch her skillful performance and to see her beauty on display. These filmmakers were lucky to have her, because the film lacked any other redeeming quality. She saved them from total disaster. Without her performance (and that of her co-star Patrick Wilson) I suspect this movie would have never seen the light of day. I will look forward to seeing her next film, whenever that may come along.",Hard Candy
625,spanmanmc,Best film of 2006,9,17 February 2007,"I rented this film in September of 2006. I often rent pulp DVDs on spec, and occasionally am rewarded with an obscure gem. In this case, I was absolutely impressed. At the end of the year, I was unable to complete a favorite ten list, but Hard Candy was at the top. Ellen Page provides a well disciplined and mature performance that belies her 14 years. Apparently, there was no general release of this film, but I would like to see it gain some mainstream recognition. If there was a modicum of justice in this world, Ms. Page would be included in the current nominees for an Academy award.The pacing of the story is rather subtle, where the two characters initially interact and move about a west LA neighborhood with an innocuous sensibility that drops few clues as to what is to transpire.Most crime or action films use vengeance to drive the plot. This film includes it as a character motivation, but does so on a very keen level. Kudos to a great first time script and director effort.",Hard Candy
626,kylekool148,Hard Candy Tastes Sweet,9,17 March 2008,"I'm browsing through the 10 dollar sale at Virgin Records, looking for something good to watch that night. I had recently seen Ellen Page in Juno, and was impressed by her performance, so when I picked up ""Hard Candy,"" I was intrigued by what she might do with the role described on the less-than-great back cover blurb.According to that DVD summary, Ellen Page played a ditsy girl lured by a pedophile to the latter's home, where things get out of hand and (it sounded to me like) Page's character (Haley) tries frantically to escape.Well. The blurb gave a very wrong impression. Haley was anything but ignorant, and the revelation in the rooftop scene proved such. Page's performance dominated the screen, exhibiting genuine emotion, which is rare in a thriller-style movie.However, it is almost an insult to call this movie a thriller or horror. It is a 'make-you-think' film, but not in the style common to that genre (the 'story just stops, with little to no ending' style). Hard Candy gives a solid ending, only leaving questions regarding Haley's actions, which was the obvious purpose of the film.Not only was the acting (I only doted on Page, but the rest of the cast was also convincing and perfectly chosen) great, but watching the film itself was not an eyesore. No jittery camera movements, save three specially stylized scenes, and no obviously-fluorescent lighting. The people actually look human; colorful and alive. In a way, this makes Haley's actions all the scarier, as human attacking human is far more frightening than emotionless-monster attacking human. The balance of every shot must also be given a nod...its like watching a smooth Apple commercial, but without the cheery music. This does get somewhat tiring, though, which is what bumped my rating down from a ten.Overall, if you have an open mind and enjoy good acting, I highly recommend this film. One note...do NOT watch this movie if you're not ready to accept a controversial storyline.And yes. I am 14 years old.",Hard Candy
627,joona-1,"Great movie, recommend it to everyone",10,18 January 2007,"I just watched Hard candy and i must say, i'm blown away... The trailer gives you a whole different idea of the film, but i'm gladly surprised. I'm a hardcore movie consumer and it takes a really good film to impress me. I would place Hard candy in the top 5 movies i've seen this year. Great work from Ellen and Patrick, and as a cinematographer and gaffer, i must say, the movie looks beautiful. Especially the hand-held shots and the dolly-shots are really great. Also though the subject in the movie is not an easy one to make an entertaining movie, this one nailed me to my seat. Although i am a sucker for girls like Ellen Page and Allison Lohman, Ellen proved herself as an serious actor in this movie.",Hard Candy
628,blackbobby,The Plot SUCKED ***SPOILER,2,11 February 2007,"I think the acting in this movie was great, but the way the movie was just played out was terrible. There were so many plot changes in this movie, it was ridiculous.This movie was cruel and sadistic, and many of you may find that appealing, but I didn't, and I can usually handle sadistic. I love Hostel and Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but what that little girl did to that man was just wrong...and there was barely any gore and blood involved. Just the thought of it, and the man begging for her to just take his life instead just made me heart wrench. I don't care what the man did, I would have been much happier if she had just let the judicial system do its job.The summary is misleading, and I'm sorry, I just didn't enjoy the movie. The camera angles were very odd and confusing. I found myself tilting my head at times just to get a straight angle. No one really wants to see half of an actors face.The only factor that keeps me from giving this movie a 1 is the outstanding acting. Although this movie has a pretty bad storyline, the acting is phenomenal. Nonetheless, it needs work for an Indie film. Maybe if they had changed the ending a little bit and left the viewers with maybe a little bit of a happy ending inside, then the film would have been a lot better.",Hard Candy

The camera work is really bad. the acting is even worse. the story is sick. The writer that wrote this should get an award, for the worst story ever, or even better they should do to him what the girl in this movie does to the boy. You can't even rate this movie on a 1 to 10 rating system, you need a 1 to 100, and it's still hard to give it a 1, that would imply that it had at least something watchable in it and there isn't. but like I said earlier, I'm 60 and no one will even care what I say, but I tried to warn you. DON'T go SEE, RENT or even WATCH This movie. It's really BAD. Don't say I didn't warn you.",Hard Candy
630,daniberg,"Something that tries to be ""Spit on your grave"" and fails miserably",2,16 November 2021,"I've read the description and got excited. The Film Poster also seems promising; the Red Riding Hood reference, the name, both elements could have been picked up so perfectly within the movie. But the only reference we get, is a red sweatshirt in the last two seconds of the movie.But that alone would not have ruined the movie for me. What did, were all the small and big choices that made the movie go in an awfully terrible direction, making me wish to never have started to watch it.To start at the very beginning; we have a promising lead cast, Actors I generally enjoy on screen. However, both the dialogue and the characters they had to play, made them unsympathetic and left me feeling more disgust towards them than anything else.The idea of the movie is great, but if i have to remind myself of it every few minutes just not to turn off the movie, it's not a good sign. I'm not sure if this is supposed to be a revenge/ psychological thriller flick leaning on the concept of 'I spit on your grave' and while I definitely see the psychological impact, the revenge factor and the consequential catharsis in said movie, I don't feel a bit of it in this one.So in short, our protagonist (the person we're ought to root for) is a 14 year-old girl who meets up with a 32 year-old (!) Stranger (!) from the internet to hook up (!). The first shots we see are from the chat, which is ""cringy"" enough, but I'll go with it; after all it's not a bad set up for the movie I was promised.They meet up in a local shop, the conversation seems a bit off, but you could write it off to the fact that they are strangers(!), have a massive age difference (!) and have only exchanged messages for 3 weeks online (!).The first thing that really threw me off, was weird (sort of seductive) behaviour. Then she invites herself into this house. While we find out later that she had this elaborate plan of her ""revenge""-plot, it's still a very nerv-wracking thought, especially considering that her parents did advise her very well on how to not behave with strangers. But until here the movie is somewhat convincing and the shakiness could be written of to the beginning phase of the movie.Because the movie spirals downwards on from there. I can't even mention all the things that went wrong but if I'm feeling pitty for the accused Pedophile, something is very wrong. I know I'm ""supposed"" to root for the Girl but at times this ""Horror-Student"" seems simply ignorant to me. What's even worse, is the constant mentioning of her powerful family, which can get her out of any trouble (but doesn't seem to care that their daughter is gone for Days?) and her self-righteous representation as a saviour when she doesn't even have any concrete evidence.And at the point where we're confronted with something hinting towards him not being quite the nice, nerdy photography guy, I've lost all sympathy towards the protagonist.While I would argue that we do find many psychopaths charming to some extent, we do so because while they have a coerced moral compass, they usually are aware of it. It's not the case here. While she wants justice (?) for the missing girl, she can't prove that Jeff had anything do to with it. And honestly a lot of details point to him not having anything to do with her disappearance.But the torture goes on. And at this point is fair to switch to the visual impression the movies left, which is even more disappointing than the last. While I'm a big fan of many 2000-2010 horror movies, even of those which are written of as ""conventionally bad"", this one is just trash. The camera movement, the colour palette, the zoom-ins, the slowmotion, the weird, rushed editing; at some points I had simply no choice but to be amused by the ridiculous choices.Many things were just unrealistic, like how can a 14 year-old overpower a thirty-something year-old man, how can the neighbour not suspect anything, how can this girl drink so much Vodka and not be drunk, why did he not run but chase here to the roof?This is supposed to be a revenge movie, but nothing screams revenge for me (even or especially not when she explained that ""she is the voice of all the girls he destroyed""). The movie screams like ""root for the unsympathetic minor-psychopath causing violence and pain because that's how she thinks problems are solved"". Not against violence or torture in movies per-se but in this case it felt like torture to finish the movie than to ""feel the torture with in"".",Hard Candy

Would you do it if Norma were your own child?The plot is solved with elegance so you don't feel guilty although you think Jeff deserves to die.Ellen Page is superb, she makes you believe her innocence and her evilness equally.

632,dark_empress-1,14 year old girl 32 year old guy then it all goes wrong,6,9 February 2007,Fantastic performance! Very touchy subject to have approached but amazingly have managed to pull it off without delving into the depths of paedophilia. Makes you understand where Hayleigh is coming from but at the same time makes you feel for Jeff. Somehow this film makes you see both sides but allows you not to pass judgement right to the very end. Was a little worried about the content of the film at first but was soon put at ease as it is more what is said than seen that paints the picture of what is going on. Very cleverly put together and could easily be true to life in todays world of internet an chat. Would recommend watching if not easily upset.,Hard Candy
633,johnandbuddy,what did you people not watch the movie,10,22 July 2007,"I've just been reading the comments of people that hated the movie and i figured out why they did. its because they obviously did not even watch the movie. every single review said there is no way a 14 year old could be the way Hayley Stark was. well if you watched the movie you know that she was not who she said she was so how do you know how old she is. and I'm waiting for someone to say ""look at her, she is obviously 14"" well if you do the math, the movie came out at the end of 05 she was almost 17 then so during the filming she was probably around 16. but thats the point there are a lot of people that look a lot younger then they are, as stated in the movie (theres a clue for you guys lol).everyone said that the fact that she was a bad guy and he was the good guy, well you guys need to think about that hard he molests children and then murdered one (if not more, i mean he didn't admit to the murder, right before he was about to get his balls cut off, which ill get into later, so who knows what other secrets he has) all she did was make him see who he really is. (which again he says in the movie).all you people that keep going on about her castrating him and that is unforgivable she when over the line. well first of all he molests girls and has murdered a girl. how is preventing him permanently from doing it again so over the line. if he got sent to jail he would get out and may do it again. and second and a lot more importantly SHE DID NOT CASTRATE HIM, if you people review a movie please Watch it, i mean come on he gets up after the operation and says ""I'm all here"" not one time but twice and pulls of a clip that had no blood on it come on people watch the movie thats all i have to say hope this will clear up these peoples thoughts.And by the why this movie was amazing at the end i was just stunned, jaw dropped and just staring like ""wow that was amazing""",Hard Candy
634,nekoawake,"yeah, it messes with your head dammit...",9,16 September 2007,"When I think about the movies the past few years, we've really had some good thrillers. I mean, this year alone we had BUG and Joshua, both films that really took their respective genre in new directions.And so, y'know, I missed Hard Candy last year, and I finally took my chance to see it. It really screws with your head. Makes me think about all the movies with sociopathic kids, BLOODY BIRTHDAY, The Omen, Joshua...y'know, the kids that you just want to see die in the film. This movie really messes with my sense of justice; maybe it's just the survival horror fan in me, but I couldn't help but think through the whole movie how I would have got away - so many times he could have bit right in to her jugular vein. But then again, this girl was smart, and he was a pedophile, albeit a tidy one, so he ""had"" to be punished as well. Jesus Christ. This little girl goes on the top of my list of creepy little kids to die. I wish I knew some back-story on her, and then maybe I wouldn't think like that...but man, this movie is about a bonafide psychopath(or sociopath, we don't know her background at all) vs sexual predator...because, you know sure, she's acting out, she's giving him the supreme punishment. But this isn't I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE here, in which we witness the lead female role being gang raped for a very long time, then cheer her on as she exacts her revenge on her rapists. No, this is just straight up seduction, drugging, and torture. I'm just as afraid of having someone like her, capable of what she did to that guy, in the demeanor in which she performed it, out in society just as much as I am about having the guy lurking about in society.Wow. So this movie is really a mindf**k for me. Way more so than Ichi the Killer ever was. I'd recommend it for anyone that's really, as another user put it, looking for something that'll leave 'em a bit screwed up for the next two or three days. However, if you're just looking for something a little less gray that won't leave you in such a disturbing quandary, maybe you should pick up HIGH TENSION or Dean Koontz's INTENSITY. But sure, I'd recommend this film. Because, really, I haven't seen anything this intense on this level since Robin Williams's performance in ONE HOUR PHOTO. :)",Hard Candy

The appearance of Ellen just added to the movie, she looked like a extremely smart teenager and playing the role of a psychological twisted sort of horror movie where we don't know who is good and who is bad until the very end. A few parts (including the start) could have been done abit better, for the actual overall appeal of the movie is not as it seems, the cover makes you think low budget horror movie and so does the beginning, while it is actually a extremely smart and mind-twisting movie that requires THOUGHT!

Truly stunning performances. If you love a movie with plot like a meditation labyrinth this film is for you. Brian nelson has an excellent gift for writing witty and delicious dialog. One of the things many people don't mention in conjunction with this film is the great care taken with the editing. Give a rather small budget the production crew really got their moneys worth from the sets and used them to best advantage. Make sure to take note of the clever use of color enhancement used to manipulate the tone of the scenes in this film. Truly a work of art this film is a must see.

I would say its a for sure Have to see!! Its got great actors and actresses in it some are real no names but after seeing it you wonder why they have not made more movies. It has a great plot and one that I want to buy as soon as I can. I would say that anyone that likes movies that shows a possible child molester get what he deserves should really see this one. Do not judge this movie by the cover of it because it is much better then that. See we found it at the library and we looked at it and was well it doesn't look like its going to be that good so we got it anyway and took it home took us almost a week to watch it but once we did we were really glad that we did.,Hard Candy

This is the film i have ever seen before that i found terrible because the story is awful and characters is so bad. The result was an hour and a half of constant laughter and spasms of the abdomen. While this movie had the script that a ten year old mental patient could write better, the fact that it was an absolutely horrible rip off of AvP didn't help either. Don't get me wrong, rip-off's are fine as far as I'm concerned, but when you butcher the original script (which was no polished pearl either, truth be told) in such a brutal and merciless way, that's just wrong.",Hard Candy
640,sherry_dk,It's the double standard that gets me.,8,21 January 2019,"This is a rather disturbing movie, not because of the obvious discomforting elements, but the lack of rationality or let's just say the double standard that really gets me on my nerves.To be fair, this is an excellently performed and produced film, for it's not an easy job to keep the audience attended for 2 hours with just 2 characters on the screen. I think the intended suspense is to keep the audience guessing whether Jeff is really guilty of what Hayley accused him of doing. Through the development of the film and the debate of yes or no, the viewers then gets to choose a side, whether you sympathize more with him or her, and essentially question yourself why you choose the side you did.But for me, I don't think the answer really matters, for you can never justify the action of one person based on that of another. The same logic lies behind that the pedophile should not act on a minor just because he/she appear to be older, act as if they are older, or even suggestive in certain behaviors, and that one should not hurt or manipulate a person just because of what he/she did. Yet the story treated as if these were different things, it can claim to be smart by ""making you think"", but if anyone had to think to reach a conclusion, then they are clearly not thinking straight.The story also seems to justify some of the morally challenging assertions by equipping the vigilante with pathogenic qualities, i.e. ""I am insane"". Now this is just unfortunate. It's unfortunate for anyone to be caught in a reluctant confrontation with a potentially murderous psychopath, regardless of whether they are satan or saint. It's just as hard for me to agree with the intentions of the film as to rationalize with an irrational being. But I guess I did enjoy it to the extend that I had to write my very first movie review, thus the 8 stars.",Hard Candy

She sure is one smart honor student with a lot of time on her hands. Ellen Page was the most annoying thing about this film though. The sarcastic comments accented by the sarcastic facial movements while touching some part of her forehead or eyebrow was a cry for acting lessons.

It make look the same and can be shaped like one but tastes completely different.Now don't take what Im saying as a defense for pedophilia because its not. I agree all those sick people deserve exactly what is coming to them but to try to solicit that a 30 some odd man can be taken down so easily by a fourteen year old girl is naive in thinking this. If this girl was so clever and knew as much as she knew why would she not simply turn him over to the authorities. She said herself that the authorities do not like pedophiles at all and as such would nail him had she had any solid evidence that he was guilty.This brings me to my first point. As mentioned above if she simply wanted to teach a lesson then let justice take its path and turn him in. If you want to try to prove that feminist are soul stealing torture obsessed maniacs then yes please keep the movie the same.All together I would not recommend this movie to anybody except for maybe the feminazi training camp.",Hard Candy

I was skeptical at first thinking Ellen Page couldn't pull off this type of acting portraying a 14 year old girl, but I was astounded. It keeps you in suspense and awe. It was slightly slow going at first, and makes you seem a tad bored waiting for the action to ensue, but once you realized what you are getting into, you can't take your eyes off the movie. You turn yourself into a detective wondering whether Hayley Starks (Ellen Page) accusations are true and you end up feelings sorry for the character Jeff. In this end, it makes you want to exact your own revenge and you stand right beside character Hayley in her want to avenge any poor girl who was attacked by any pedophile. Superb acting!

654,patricbates,The worst experience of my life,1,15 June 2008,"I have so much loathing for this film, I can barely get my thoughts straight. Where could I possibly begin? I guess I'll start with the hideous Ellen Page and her god awful performance. Honestly, the first time I saw the trailer for this film I mistook her for Haley Joel Osment for Christ's sake. Apparently that boyish haircut she wears in this movie is supposed to make her look more young and innocent, but I don't buy it. The only thing that could be worse than her looks however, is her unbearably annoying, scratchy voice. As much as I love music I would rather cut off both my ears than hear her say another sentence ever again. Even when she's talking about something as serious as castrating Patrick Wilson she keeps stammering and saying ""like"" every other word like some stupid, shy girl with no confidence.As for the film itself, well, let's just say a radically Islamic suicide bomber is subtler and less straightforward than this sh**ty screenplay. The camera work in some scenes was way overdone (like the camera looking like it's suffering a spaz attack in a ridiculous scene where Patrick Wilson starts to lose consciousness after being drugged). Every single camera shot and film technique was completely predictable, and this is coming from an 18-year-old with no prior filming experience whatsoever. The same could be said for the embarrassingly bad dialogue, but what else would you expect from a film completely focused on an out of character, sadistic, 14-year-old-girl and a mentally weak, pussy whipped child photographer. It's as if the director just got angry with a news report about a pedophile and decided to a make one of those sadistic films where one gets captivated and tortured (which seems to be all the rage these days) just to vent his anger. Well, this turd (I'm not even going to say ""turd of a movie"" because that would be giving it too much credit) turned out just as half-baked and poorly thought out as you would expect from anything with an extremely simple and pointless message.And for a movie that's supposed to be a ""psychological thriller"", there wasn't a single scene where I was scared or even tense. Even during the castration scene I just sat there with a confused look on my face wondering what kind of pathetic existence David Slade must have if he thought a 14-year-old girl mangling a bound, older man is frightening. Scare Tactic Lesson #1 - Unless it's science fiction, the viewer has to believe it could actually happen to them in order to be scared of the situation. I suppose if the atmosphere was masterfully done, say to the level of Alfred Hitchcock, then it might have been slightly disturbing, but no such luck with these idiots.After I was finished watching this garbage I wasn't just disappointed and disgusted, I was furious that I actually wasted a portion of my life on this filth. As passive a person as I am in real life, the only thought I had after the film ended was butchering Ellen Page with a kitchen knife for putting me through that horsesh**, not even caring that her real life personality could be the polar opposite of her character in this movie. Luckily, I only watched this movie through Youtube in 10 segments and didn't actually see it all the way through on T.V. or DVD, so I guess it made it easier for me to block it out of my memory. Plus, I went through very thorough self-therapy afterwards by watching a bunch of hilarious video clips on Youtube while listening to relaxing music, so that helped too.I've never written criticism for any movie I've ever seen, but I really felt like I needed to vent this out of my system and also warn others of this sorry excuse for entertainment. Basically, if you're the kind of person who's into hardcore, sadomasochistic, teenage femdom (minus all the sexuality) then there is a slight possibility you might enjoy this. But if you desperately want to keep however many brain cells you have left in your head then stay the hell away from this crap, don't make the same mistake I made just because of my overwhelming curiosity.",Hard Candy
655,mindwalkernine,Acting and Social Impact,1,13 June 2009,"I will comment on the acting and sociological impact of the story.On a scale of 1 to 10, I give the acting an 8. Patrick Wilson did an excellent job of subtleties of facial expressions of lying. Ellen Page did the typical job of psychopath acting-one emotion extreme to another, and a talentless job of unemotional coldness.On social impact, I give the film a 1. It stirs up hatred based upon pseudo-science. It's overall effect supports the current right-wing radical moralism and left-wing pseudo-scientific statutory sex legal agenda. The movie does this being 95% about conditioning viewers to feel hatred and violence toward statutory sex and/or teenage pornography (which has no empirical basis of crime). Patrick's character did deserve to die ( The torture was simply a wasted of time, but who cares about a murderer). But this movie wasn't about justice, it was about the first 95%, which conditions viewers with irrational views toward statutory sex, leaving the justice to be only understood by a very late payoff. The irrational fallacious views this film helps support is that all teenage pornography is filthy/exploitative and all sex between a teen and post-teen must be filthy and/or exploitative and never could be a enjoyable relationship for both.It's all right-wing religiosity and left-wing pseudo-science. Two ignorant groups out for one common goal: marriage of idiocy stinking up the silver screen. And this film conditions this kind of inferior thinking upon the masses.",Hard Candy

Not only does it have a bit of Hitchcock theme to it with a slick and stylish view of fear.But it also have a type of Grim fairy tale to it, with the theme of the little red riding hood( played by the fantastic Ellen Paige) up against the big bad wolf. The evil wolf at the end hangs himself and red riding hood lives to see another day.Well if there is one thing i've learn from this film, No body likes goldfrap, well at least in the movie.

This movie has no actual story line, only vaguely tells the characters. It is totally and utterly disappointing. It follows no rational progress. Don't get me wrong. I appreciate the movies that talk about important social issues. These are important to raise awareness and tell the stories of the victims. But this is just not in the movie. It is sadistic for the sole purpose of being sadistic. The movie doesn't portray the social issues surrounded with child abuse.

658,promiselife,The only good thing about this movie were the acting skills.,2,16 September 2009,"I am a huge Ellen Page fan, but had always avoided seeing this film, as I had heard some not so great reviews in the past. It was described to me (by the owner of the film) as intense. But by the end of the movie (and several times within), I questioned whether that is a good enough word to describe what's contained in this movie.I myself am not a fan of horror movies, or much of anything that contains gore, violence or intense agony as the main theme. But again, I was excited to see what Ellen Page did for the movie.In the beginning, I had thought I knew where the plot was headed, only to get completely surprised by what happened next. But after the original shock of seeing Ellen Page ""take control"" of the situation, I wasn't surprised by too much else.She played the part well, manipulative, evil and just plain crazy. To be fair, she DID tell him she was crazy.The amount of torture and pain caused upon this man, whether he deserved it or not (up for your debate), is incredible. It's un-frikken-believable.The castration scene, although it did not show enough details to be considered ""sickening"" to most, had me physically sick to my stomach and feeling sickened the entirety of the film. The concept was horrid and so was the entire scene,especially ""Jeff's"" expressions and ""Hayley's"" occasional comments.But above all, she told him throughout the movie such things as that she wasn't going to kill him, only to end up suppressing, scaring and manipulating him into his eventual ""suicide"", right before which she tells him she will take care of any evidence.Which, I might add, she does not. The ending was just terrible, it gave no closure to his life or to the situation. I not only would not recommend it as a movie to ANYONE, but especially not to a young person.Rated-R movies are often showed to children, DO NOT show this to your child. It has a high chance to being upsetting, possibly in the long-term to your child, and possibly to you.",Hard Candy

The reviews I read on here had very mixed opinions and it seemed people either loved it or slated it so based on that I decided to watch it. There's fantastic acting from the female lead she seems to really get you on her side and at times makes you giggle from her sarcasm. The 14 year old girl first appears to be very naive and quite annoying however she has the whole thing planned out and turns your opinion of her around very quickly. Elements I did not like about this film are that almost the entire film is set in the same location which makes it quite repetitive and at points and boring! They could have done more with the start of the film and included how these pedophiles gain trust from the young girls something that parents should be aware of.

She certainly appears to be an innocent victim going to meet a possible victimizer. What then transpires between the 2 of them, however, is quite unexpected and more than a little off-putting.I can't go into more details, but, believe me, there's enough here to keep you watching until the somewhat preposterous ending The problem is, exactly who Page's character really is  or, more to the point  what motivates her  is not revealed.

Does Jeff deserve what he gets or does he become a victim at some point? Is Hayley a feminist heroine or a nut-job? ''Hard Candy"" wants you to wonder which is the more warped desire, forbidden sex or blind vengeance, and it asks, too, if there's an acceptable line between keeping unseemly thoughts in our heads and acting upon them. However, the movie's creepiest paradox is that the gamine young creature might be the pervert in the room.

669,lilac_484,Disappointing,2,17 March 2007,"this film began well. page's acting seemed sound and this was the same for Wilson. however, when it 'turned' it became terrible. page's acting became appalling and almost embarrassing for her. she took what was meant to be a mature 14 year old and created an annoying little teen because she over acted. Wilson's acting however was a lot better, largely supporting the film.the plot was also unrealistic. if she could find out so much, so could the police. page's character itself was difficult to believe regardless of the acting. she was overly confident in everything she did, not once thinking twice even though she caused one death and is in the process of causing another - and she's only meant to be 14. the audience is given small parts of dialogue about her uncaring parents which is meant to make sense of her actions and perhaps show how she's able to carry them out when other teen's wouldn't - so she's troubled too. but it's not at all enough. more of a story behind her character could've added a lot of depth to the film.visually the film was interesting, but also overdone in parts and only really worked well when used subtly, for example, a part nearer the beginning when they're talking in the studio and the background colour behind page changes each time the camera focuses on her. other than that, instead of complimenting the film, the 'style' drowns it.the basic story is interesting - a different look on an infamous issue. but then that's all it is and everything that could've been thought provoking or effective was cut short and not fully developed. it relies too much on the 'uniqueness' and i think must be why so many seem to like it, at least it's the only reason i can see. i think it could've been so much, but unfortunately lacks so much instead.",Hard Candy

671,morticia37,twisted brilliance - some spoilers,10,23 June 2006,"The way I judge a good film is whether my butt cheeks go to sleep half way through. I am by nature a fidget and I am also a smoker. I can safely say that I got all the way through this film without dead butt or cigarette cravings. To be honest, when watching the adverts for hard Candy I didn't really know what to expect. I expected the film to be gritty, I expected the tension, I basically knew some of the plot, but I didn't expect what I went on to see.The plot, without ruining too much, runs through a relationship between a 14 year old girl (Hayley) and a 32 year old photographer (Patrick). The meet up after chatting on the net for a few weeks and after meeting head back to the photographers house. They talk about his photography and his subjects (mostly teenage girls), have a couple of alcoholic drinks, and then as he begins taking pictures of her in the lounge he collapses. When he wakes up he finds that Hayley drugged him and has some pretty grim plans in store for him. The cinematography was amazing, I would give this film an award just for that alone. And the script left me reeling, twists and turns abundant, the characters are well written and the plot is evenly spaced leaving enough tension and suspense running throughout to keep you guessing and hanging on for the conclusion. The characters are so well written in fact that it throws a lot of questions into the mix and will have you talking with your friends for hours after the credits have rolled. For example, the character of Patrick. When we meet him he is a charming and good looking thirty something year old. When we find out that he may or may not have committed these gruesome acts we are torn as to whether we can actually hate him or not. It feels morally wrong in a way to like him, yet there is actually something likable about him, and there is nothing really given to us as ammunition to hate him. Other subjects that the film will throw into the conversation would be the realisticness of the grooming scene at the beginning, the way Patrick reiterated that Hayley was a baby, the type style he used, the attempt to dominate the young girl, to have power over her. from reading various entrapment websites and the language that various paedophiles have used when talking to teenagers on line, I found the scene and the way the two characters conversed to be both realistic and slightly chilling.After leaving the cinema I felt slightly queasy. i think though this could be to do with the combination of certain scenes and me eating through a giant bag of peanut m and m's. The only warning I will give is this is an 18 and you should be prepared that nothing is sugar coated or glossed over. This is though the best and most original piece of cinema I have seen in the last 10 years. A must see for any cinema goer.~If you enjoy this i would also recommend seeing ""The Warzone"" (directed or written by I think Tim Roth, and starring ray Winston) which throws up similar questions, food for thought, and conversation subjects.",Hard Candy
672,muphart,Too long,4,26 September 2012,"Watching a guy get tortured, then watching him struggling unsuccessfully to get free until he's finally barely able to, only to get captured and tortured some more was painful enough - then it happened a couple more times. The circumstances of who he was were completely irrelevant. The movie failed to go anywhere or have a change of scene or pace or anything when it got into the last third. Every subtle hint that something different or interesting might happen turned into nothing, such as the neighbor coming over or the story about his aunt. These scenes were just to give the viewer a brief break before going back to the torturing, but they became torture themselves when we realize they don't mean anything to the story. Snuff film that went on too long. If you don't know anyone or are not yourself the victim of molestation or murder who has unresolved anger towards the perpetrator, this movie is not for you.",Hard Candy
673,jacquelinek25,Entrancing and hard to forget.,7,29 October 2014,"This movie is a perfect example of simplicity producing a compelling story and complex characters. With only the two actors as the central characters, the audience receives a narrow window into the main plot, knowing only what they tell us through subtle hints and confessions. The one setting of the movie also constricts the world of the story, creating a claustrophobic tension where Hayley resorts to acts unexpected from a teenage girl to force Jeff to confess to his crimes.The main aspect concerning Hayley that make her deeds seem so unexpected is the fact that she is a teenager and one that is initially portrayed as a typical, timid but outgoing young girl who is on the border of venturing into an adult world - reading avidly, taking university classes and engaging in sexual topics. However, we find that she is actually well versed in the ways of the world and is vastly different from what we expected - spiritually and physically. Hayley knows and does things we wouldn't even expect most adults to partake in, and even her bag isn't filled with books as we thought. By the end of the film, the audience, along with Jeff, realise that there is nothing concrete we know about Hayley and she may not even be as young as she claimed. Many could argue that Jeff deserves his fate and Hayley's psychologically tormenting interrogation, however, I personally agreed with Jeff when he urged Hayley not to go through with his castration. Despite his intent of saving himself, the idea of a young girl doing such a thing made me cringe and wonder if it would feel different watching an adult in the role instead. In Law Abiding Citizen, for example, torture far more gruesome is involved, yet the idea is easier to accept. The ending of the film makes the audience view Hayley in a different light, perhaps in a way that does make the previous idea easier to accept. After all, she demonstrates she possesses experience and the truth all along after revealing she had dealt with the other killer. Experience and her ruthless manner make her more an adult than anyone else her age; the main reason we cringe when watching is that this fact is only revealed slowly and not fully until the end. Throughout, we witness instances of weakness where she makes mistakes or screams to herself, although, these are arguably due to her stress and frustration, not the existence of naivety belonging to a child. The persona that sometimes shines through to Jeff that she is far from joking turns out to be the real Hayley as she shows no mercy in the end and has no breakdown like the instances previously shown. While the character of Jeff deserves recognition, his role is simple in being a guilty person attempting to cover up his crimes and hide his weaknesses. It is the role of Hayley which dominates the film as her role is unexpected and moves the plot along. Ellen Page did a wonderful job in conveying two sides of Hayley - a polite, intelligent, bashful girl, whilst allowing the ruthless interrogator leak out more and more as the story progressed. The film begins with Hayley fully in the role of the typical naive teenager, but this is all an act. Despite this, this 'act' continues to leak through from making sure she didn't overdose Jeff with drugs to convincing him he should kill himself in a scarily caring manner. This questions the existence of Hayley's 'nice' side, though, since her caring, easy- going persona could only be for psychological torture, and her promise of covering up Jeff's crimes at the end goes unfulfilled. She is constantly pointing out her inexperience of doing things like spiking drinks, tying people up and castration. The fact that she only fools Jeff into thinking he was castrated proves that she knows exactly what she's doing and this was all planned out. Therefore, the unmerciful side could be all there is to Hayley.The plot moved along at an easy pace. Some scenes were very draining but never continued for too long. The rare situation also proved to be set out realistically as well. Jeff seemed to scream just about as much as you'd expect him to and provided a challenge to Hayley sometimes, as a grown man would to a short female. Whenever he broke free, he would show his criminal side, indicating his need for control. When the only important person to him appears at the end, the last hope for him to regain control is lost and he decides to take fate into his hands, hanging himself (although his hanged body is never shown). And Hayley realistically makes mistakes as well, such as being spotted on the roof by a nearby neighbour. Overall, Hard Candy isn't a film I'd watch over and over, but it is one that stuck with me for a long while. While you'd think the morals in this movie are black and white, I still feel it's wrong for Hayley to do these things. At the same time, I feel Jeff deserves them to an extent. I'm unsure whether this is to do with Hayley being a young girl and having to sacrifice her childish values or the fact that I'm uncomfortable with the idea of Jeff being punished this way. Hayley could have gotten him to confess and called the police, but this clearly isn't enough for her. She possesses a strict sense of justice that is arguably twisted in the sense that there doesn't seem to be any mercy left in her. There is a 'good guy' and 'bad guy' in this movie, but Hayley definitely lies somewhere in between, with the 'good guys' perhaps being the normal justice system. Like a 'hard candy,' Hayley may seem sweet at first, but has a heart of steel.",Hard Candy
674,shadydally,Great premise...pretty bad execution,6,14 April 2006,"First of all, I must commend the editors of trailers because the trailer for this movie pretty much summed up the plot and showed the best moments of it, which were the first 10-20 minutes. The pacing, dialogue, directing and even acting were the best in the beginning. After about 20 minutes, everything starts going downhill. The major issue with this movie is the writing. The dialogue is pretty bad. And God bless the actors for doing the best they could with the material they are given. Ellen Page is menacing...even with her small, unassuming frame and face. The directing is decent and the cinematography saves it from being a complete catastrophe. All in all, if you really wanna see this film, you're probably gonna see it anyway.

675,DrBillyLong_iu-1,molestation and pedophilia are mutually exclusive,1,8 October 2006,"The premise of Hard Candy is that intergenerational intimacy (IGI) is all bad. Not only is it bad, but it is evil. There is no middle ground whatsoever; if you engage in intimate relations with someone who is under the arbitrarily defined age limit, then you are the scourge of the planet. You really have to ""love"" this level of overly simplistic dichotomous thinking. According to Hard Candy, anytime a man in his 30s is attracted to a girl who is in her early teens there must be something pathological about it. The producers of this film have clearly bought into the nonsensical idea that the arbitrary line of demarcation for adolescence is valid. According to the argument presented here, sexual attraction can only be justified if it is between adults. The implicit notion is that any intimacy shared between girls in their early teens and adult males must lead inevitably to some kind of catastrophic harm (e.g., depression, mental illness, unemployment, the dog will inevitably die, and so on). While of course this is complete nonsense, this does not stop Hard Candy. It incessantly bombards the viewer with ridiculous notions of ""damage,"" ""injury,"" ""victimization,"" ""violation"" and myriad other ""injuries"" that will result if two people share physical contact when they are not of the same age bracket.If this is not bad enough, the major participants in the movie frequently create an inaccurate confluence with the terms ""molester"" and ""pedophile."" Apparently, the writers of the screenplay did not know that to molest, by definition, is to seek to do harm to an individual. A pedophile, on the other hand, is a person who genuinely loves children (ped = child: phile = to love). Anyone who has performed even a cursory review of the relevant scientific literature knows that the pedophile typically does things with children because of genuine attraction and love. For example, the typical pedophile will help children do homework, take the child to a museum, spend time reading and discussing literature, talk about future aspirations and dreams, oh, and yes, perhaps share physical intimacy. The point here is that sexual contact and/or intimacy ranks very low in the list of priorities for the typical child lover. Along the same lines, available data show that people who have had sexual relations with adults (when they were children) overwhelmingly describe them as positive experiences. However, Hard Candy never lets the facts get in the way of a good witch-hunt. On the contrary, the goal here is to blur the distinction between a genuine child lover and a molester (someone who seeks to hurt a child).To watch this film is nothing short of torture in and of itself. In the United States, we are in the midst of a witch-hunt. The perpetrators of the witch-hunt are not seeking out women who have special powers as in the past; indeed, in this case, the witch-hunt is to go after any individual who expresses any physical attraction or sexual desire for someone who is of a substantially different age. Take a little armchair psychology, bigoted phobia of IGI, mix it together with a little ""lets castrate the evil molester"" and bad acting and you have ""Hard Candy."" Doesn't anyone ever read scientific journals and academic literature anymore? Are we reduced to having movies made by people who get their information about adult-child love from Oprah?

676,LuvHoney_,Awful.....Just awful.,2,17 November 2006,"Well from the trailer this did look like it would be a pretty good film. I was looking forward to a gripping story filled with thrilling scenes and compelling dialogue. How shocked I was to see about 10 minutes of plot stretched over 100+ minutes. After hearing this film being sold by critics as the ""Thriller of the year"" I was eager to view this. The first 15 minutes had me gripped. Not through interest in the story being told, but just through belief that something WILL happen. I'm sure this film was meant to have you routing for the girl but after 20 minutes of bullying the paedophile you cant help but wish he could just jump up, finish her off and free us from this constant grind of nothingness. After about 45 minutes of nothing much going on I started to wonder what else I could be doing with my time. Maybe scraping the enamel off my teeth with a plastic spork would be more fun? Perhaps I could go and spend a nice 45 minutes in the rest room?

678,msirois89,"The visuals are 'candy', but the plot may be 'hard' to interpret.",7,24 July 2007,"I'll start off by saying that any avid movie-goer who enjoys beautiful cinematography will enjoy and respect this film for what it is. But, what it is translates into nothing more than a visually fantastic piece of confusion. Throughout the entire film, the audience is left debating over who they should take sides with: the villain or the protagonist? It's an odd conflict, which at first seems innovative but ultimately diverts into the average.However, what the film lacks in story, it seriously redeems itself in captivating, gruesome and heart-wrenching scenes. Once the film finally warms up and starts elevating, the tension rises to a level in which a viewer may feel an odd, uneasy sense in their stomach, simply because the viewer never knows what the characters will discover.This film is far from perfect, but it is oddly entertaining. I would recommend it as an interesting, O.K. thriller, but I would never consider it to be a masterpiece. Ultimately, a viewer may feel that the plot leaves you without a moral or resolution, but that's fine because this film truly has no resolution. Without an interpretation, ""Hard Candy"" is a mediocre film that has been skillfully and wonderfully created and fashioned.",Hard Candy

682,burnt_orange_zombie,Why are so many bad movies rated so highly on IMDb?,1,31 January 2007,"Read any of the myriad of one star reviews on this film to see how I feel about it.What's puzzling to me is how many people can honestly like something that is so bad? And its not the whole sex abuser versus torture thing. I don't care about the debate of whether she was right or wrong--that only justifies the filmmakers attempt to make it ""controversial."" Its the fact that the dialog is awful, and clichéd. That pretty quickly a 14-year old girl disappears and instead becomes the screenwriter's narration, which is didactic and preachy, and a tad bit condescending.A 14-year old girl could never haul around the dead weight of an adult male, or female for that matter. The kick in the head he gives her would have left her dazed for much longer than what happens. When he rammed his chair against her pinning her against the wall, repeatedly, it would have incapacitated her pretty severely. Of course, the consequence of that would have been her passing out while he dies from saran wrap asphyxiation.And all her rope tying and again, moving what has to be at least a 175lbs all over the place like its nothing is something most adult men couldn't do, much less a 14-year old girl.It goes on and on. She talks him into committing suicide? What? And he buys into it? This movie is awful for many reasons, but the main one is that is simply stupid. And worse, its predictable. We know in advance that every escape attempt he makes will be thwarted. Why? Well, because its too early in the film for him to escape. So why even draft that, Mr. Screenwriter of Crap? We know when he picks up the gun that he won't kill her. Because your pretension is unfortunately not only sloppy in its failure to cover galaxy sized holes, its also predictable. And predictable is boring. And to the IMDb reviewers, can you please quit writing that the acting is good even if you hate the plot. The acting is not good. At all. This thing stinks to high heaven. The color scheme came from one of those home design television shows you see on the tube. Oh, and another little annoyance--anyone notice how the bar he picks her up in has the exact same walls as his home? I checked in the trivia, and it is because apparently it was filmed in the same place. Wow, nice job of hiding that. ""not."" Anyone who recommends this movie is not your friend and should not be trusted for any opinions on movies as they are morons.

The film maker requires the audience to believe a whole lot of implausible actions by the lead character, Hayley. These implausibilities drags the film down from being a great film to good film. Simply the character of Hayley, could not physically or mentally do what see does in this film. The performance by Ellen Page (Hayley), 14 year old actress, is an incredible performance and make is this film worth a look, plus the fact that this film was projected off HD Projection and looked incredible.",Hard Candy
685,jocelyn-gil17,Hard Candy,8,18 October 2013,"""Hard Candy"" Sugar and Spice and Everything Not So Nice! The psychological drama, ""Hard Candy"" is an unsettling, yet enticing film filled with controversy leaving the viewer with the question of who is the true villain. Is it Haley Stark, a darling, sophisticated, vindictive teen, brought to life by Ellen Page? Could it be Jeff Kohlver, a charming, suave, pedophile, who is brilliantly played by Patrick Wilson? The viewer should choose. The opening scene starts off in a chat room between Thonggrrrrl14 and Lensman319. The conversation is filled with sexual innuendos. Haley, or Thonggrrrrl14, seems to be very flirtatious and Lensman319, or Jeff, eats it up like chocolate cake. Haley suggests that the two should meet at a coffee shop. Jeff jumps right on the opportunity to meet up with the young lady. The meeting at this coffee house leads to an invitation to the apartment of the ""Big Bad Wolf"". Of Course, ""Little Red Riding Hood"" could not refuse. After taking a lengthy ride in Jeff's Mini Cooper, the two end up at the apartment. Haley makes herself comfortable; mixes herself and Jeff alcoholic beverages, which Jeff does not turn down and they swig them back to back. These two, one more than the other, are feeling the effects of their drinks. Haley decides she wants Jeff to take her picture as she performs a strip tease on his couch but Jeff has been overtaken by his desires or his drink and blacks out. Jeff wakes up strapped into a chair and becomes a prisoner in his own home, and unfortunately for him little miss Haley is the guard and is completely cold towards his pleas. This role reversal carries out through the majority of the film and Jeff is subjected to a variety of torture tactics. Within these scenes lies an interesting debate on the rights and wrongs of the situation and society. The screenplay,written by Brian Nelson, for this film is excellent but the camera techniques are unbelievable. The colorist, Jean-Clement Soret, was able to use a high impact color grading and DI . He brightened the colors of the walls and lights to create shadows in specific scenes were Haley is beginning her transformation into the vengeful teenager. This technique was also used in scenes where Jeff is becoming irritated with Haley's actions and he is turning towards his dark side. This technique is a brilliant way of foreshadowing and a great way to create more intensity in scenes to add to the already insane plot line. Ellen Page and Patrick Wilson gave life to the script and brought forth such incredible performances. Patrick Wilson's background in theater fit perfectly into this very dramatic and theatrical exchange between two individuals. He was able to give Jeff some emotional attributes to allow the audience to feel sympathetic towards the character although Jeff is a pedophile. Ellen Page was able to make Haley a serious force to be reckoned with, despite the fact this character is only 14 years of age. Her commitment to the character trigger thoughts within the viewer and it became quite controversial. Wilson and Page poured their hearts out into these personalities and were able to play into their roles without judging the actions of the characters. ""Hard Candy"" is a film not made for viewers with weak stomachs. This movie stirs up lots of emotions. It centered around a specific theme; the importance of taking responsibility for your actions. The viewer will be left questioning how they feel about the characters and who is right or wrong. If the viewer is looking for a movie to blow them away, while making them cringe, ""Hard Candy"" is their movie.",Hard Candy
686,backupabsies1998,"Soft, Out-of-Date Candy",3,9 November 2013,"To be frank, I had much more sympathy for the pedophile than I did for Ellen Page's character (she was so cold and hard to connect with my brain obviously didn't think it worthwhile to remember her character's name.)It was too unrealistic and the fact she shows herself to him in a bra and speaks and acts suggestively towards him at some points makes me dislike the lead role even more so. I was expecting such excellence from this film and it really fell FLAT, in my opinion. There wasn't enough context and information to make me BELIEVE he was a pedophile- even at the end, I wasn't completely convinced, and the contrast between 'innocent' Ellen and 'heroic, bad-ass' Ellen was tiny. I know the whole point was to show that pedophiles aren't just 60-year-old men but there wasn't a substantial enough basis there (in my opinion. Maybe I'm just VERY slow!)

I strongly disagree with that, as long as spoilers are avoided. That being said, I have relied on all of you out there to help me choose movies. So... why did film buffs decide not to mention there were 2 actors, and 2 actors only? This was almost an educational film for those interested in the subject. Obviously I was unprepared for the intensity and the way the subject was addressed. The one thing I cannot watch is ""torture"". Love horror films, etc.; but not a film that was nothing but torture, whether or not it was an excellent piece of work or not. The formal review at the top of the page did not give me a clue, nor did reading the forum ahead of time. I realize you all like to chat with each other but it would be most helpful to be forewarned of the true nature of a film as single-minded as this. That's all folks. Just a comment, thought it might interest those of you who chat on IMDb all the time.

688,kid16mm,It may not be taken so well,8,29 April 2006,"I just saw this film and enjoyed it for several reasons but I don't think it plays so well to an audience. A couple of people walked out with in the first half hour as you begin to feel uncomfortable. This film tackled the idea very particularly in that it made the rapist somewhat sympathetic. Through the story you don't SEE what makes him such a bad person; we don't see photographs and he never makes a solid move on the girl, yet throughout the film you feel like giving him the benefit of the doubt. Instead you question her character because she was the deceitful one; maybe she's wrong about him and he didn't kill the missing girl. Even when he ""sincerely"" says he has no porn we want to trust him. The story wants to draw you in so that you can believe these things with the intention of making the audience understand how it feels to be ""charmed"" by this guy. The film appears very gruesome without showing a single gruesome image. In a way we don't want to see these things. You hear about events involving molested children but over countless films that tackle the issue it never gets comfortable; as it shouldn't. BUT we need to understand these things. Hayley almost appears to be a fairytale character along the lines of little red riding hood. We never see what Jeff really did and therefore in the end you don't really feel any kind of satisfaction. In my opinion this film does not intend to present us with real characters or an actual situation because we can understand how far-fetched Hayley's character can be. I felt the film intended to present us with a thought process, and/or an impression of an illusion that is meant to inspire us to take our own subsistence into consideration.",Hard Candy

The bad wolf would have continued to hunt but what will little red riding hood do? It is possible she will be caught but she has already got away with it once. There is no reason she won't continue as she places no trust in society to do what is necessary. It is interesting to note that her aim is not a simple one. She does not kill them she sets them up to kill themselves a difficult choice but one that allows her to retain the moral high ground in her own mind at least. I would like to know her history and what finally drove her to carrying out her actions. Her reference to ""4 out of 5 doctors agree"" is telling.I also liked the reference at the beginning of the film to Romeo and Juliet, a subject of forbidden love and an earlier society's different attitude to the age of the participants. What society condones changes, what a healthy society should condone is debatable but nature has a way of catching up with you if you insist on fouling your own nest.",Hard Candy

But there's one problem I have with this one: The interpretations: Some see it as an ultra feminist movie, some like this movie cause they think it's about how awesome killing pedophiles is.Personally, I fcking hate death sentence and all the people who support it. Really, I hate it so passionate! Thus, I can even understand how someone hates this movie.So why do I love this movie so much?Well, guys, first of all I don't take it too seriously. It's just an awesome psycho thriller to me. Also, who said Hayley was the hero? I think it is intended that you partly sympathize with her, but partly also with Jeff. After all, Hayley is pretty much as bad as Jeff. He might have done worse things, but that's just because of his terrible sickness. Hayley, on the other hand, plans her crimes over the long way.

I was shocked to find that instead they chose an attractive, modern, friendly-looking guy that at a first glance, nobody would expect to be a rapist,So, when I saw that his guy didn't have very much evidence of rape, I found myself already hating this movie,I hated how towards the end we started feeling guilty for the antagonist and all I really wanted was for Jeff to escape and kill the protagonist.Something that would've made this better would be if they hadn't made Hayley so cocky and mature, and downright crazy, and instead made her more like a normal teenage girl.It basically started out being a good informative movie about internet safety, but as it progressed it generally turned into brutal torture. And honestly, if you were to get your testicles cut off, wouldn't you feel it? It didn't make sense that Jeff would think Hayley cut his testicles off if he didn't feel any pain.This was an okay concept of a movie and they ruined it, and the ending left me extremely unsatisfied.",Hard Candy

The story was sick and nobody knows what happened in the end. The whole movie was bias as candy was given super powers which included 14 year old girl performing surgical skills and clearing all the evidences. In the start it seemed interesting however but it was bad ending as nobody knows that jeff was guilty or not and candy continued her life ever after as nothing happened. I want to congratulate author for writing such a pathetic story seriously I feel bad for even watching it as every moment of it was sick and useless. I am astonished that it is considered for Oscar nomination. WHAT HAS Happened TO WESTERN MEDIA?

696,ritoxavi,Anti-intellectualism,4,17 October 2015,"Wikipedia defines pedophilia as, ""a psychiatric disorder in which an adult or older adolescent experiences a primary or exclusive sexual attraction to prepubescent children, generally age 11 years or younger. As a medical diagnosis, specific criteria for the disorder extend the cut-off point for prepubescence to age 13."" But this film seems to turn a blind eye to that and calls Jeff a pedophile for post-pubescent sexual attractions. Pedophilia is still not universally accepted as a sexual orientation nor as a disorder but is certainly not a crime. Child molestation on the other hand is and the film keeps an uncomfortable silence and maintains an ambiguity on finding proof which, if found, could be criminally punishable. It might be that Jeff is completely innocent as it is unclear (again) whether the gun was a licensed gun or not. He even admitted to give the name of the murderer of Moyer (he claims to be) who (and even Jeff after that) could be investigated for the murder. Now that renders Jeff not guilty of anything criminal till further proofs can be found against him.The real criminal, however, without a shadow of doubt, is the character which may be is named Haley. She is guilty of drugging, castrating and trespassing into the private property of a fellow human being.An alternative thought could be, that Jeff is an extremely stupid human who doesn't know how terms are defined and how the law itself works and hence falls for some illogical threats of Haley. And also that Haley was a, dumb and pretentious prodigy, or schizophrenic and in either case, a sociopath, who also is ignorant of how terms are defined and how the law works. This makes it a tedious and stupid film about 2 stupids engaged in their incessant stupidities.Although the film takes off brilliantly the rest is just absolutely uncomfortable, mindless, exasperating and painful to watch.",Hard Candy

I love the character development and feel that the acting was superb. I love how Ellen Page portrayed Haylee. I feel that her speaking as an adult and not as a typical young teenager helped forward the sense of her mental instability, if she is. Other reviews have pointed out that Haylee couldn't physically do the things she did in the film like moving around Jeff, especially the first hanging part. If you pay attention you could see how she lifted him up with ropes and how she drags him around. I loved the pacing of this film and that it was kept simple. I like that they made Jeff attractive and charming, it feels more real. Pedophiles in real life could be anyone, not only creepy looking people. I also love the way they developed his psyche, they perfectly pulled off his being in denial that what he does is wrong, down to telling the story about his cousin. This is classic abuser psychology since no one wants to believe they are a bad person. I would recommend this to lots of people, but be aware that it is definitely not horror.

First of all, as I was reading the reviews of this film on IMDb, I can't relate at all to the people that gave this ""movie"" more than a 1 star. This was a total political statement by the writer and director. Don't these people understand this?... maybe they do and are part of some kind of political issue themselves.I agree completely with all the other 1 star reviewers, and wish to add one thing. The pedophile in the movie played by Patrick Wilson told his captor, a young girl who we have NO idea whether or not she herself was molested, a story about his childhood. He was burned on a stove by a mother of a young girl slightly younger than he was. Didn't ""Hayley"" realize that he too was a victim of child abuse?... if he was underage when this all went down for him, this situation opens up another subplot that is completely ignored by the political writings of the author, who only wishes to point out that girls are the only ones that deserve retribution for their molestation. Why the writer mentioned this is beyond me, as it completely shifted the attention and sympathy to the pedophile and not the psychotic girl. What a waste.If you are going to make a film political about a subject that the writer and director think should be talked about, don't be so one-sided about the message. To me that stinks of agendas. Especially if you elude to another side to a controversy then ignore it completely.And ya... a 14 year old girl lugging around a grown man?... Really?",Hard Candy

It sets the story and then dives right into it. The acting was superb and the suspense was thick. You really get a feeling of what the characters are experiancing because the camera doesn't let you feel any other way. For about 50% of the movie, all you can see is the actors face taking up the whole screen. But that's a good thing. I give this movie about an 8 or 9, it's a one of a kind.

Sure it is a revenge fantasy that might be slightly unrealistic, but what is wrong with that? Is it not enough to watch a teenage girl torture a pedophile? The is nothing wrong with some wish fulfillment. This movie was so cathartic, I was tearing up with pride at every one of Hayley's actions. I, and I am sure many other girls and women were finding an outlet for their revenge fantasies watching this movie.
The torture scenes were great and I delighted in Jeff's fear, especially the castration scene, where I was legitimately crying from laughter. It is only a shame she didn't actually castrate him.

Also, maddened about how it is devoid of meaning. However, who decided that film needs a ""moral meaning""? Probably most viewers could not walk away from the film because they were subconsciously excited by the grotesque and disturbing situations. Visually it isn't gory but the imagination is fueled by pleas of mercy for the most part of the movie. Even, if the viewer walked out of the theater, the movie has made an emotional impact which could be an compliment for the director, David Slade. The film's poster is a witty adaptation of the ""Little Red Riding Hood"" and makes a sarcastic first impression and incites visual metaphors after the viewing. In the cover, the 14 year-old Hayley ,played by Ellen Page, wears a red hoodie and is standing on top of a gigantic trap waiting to expose, revenge, and punish the wolf.

The writers of ""Hard Candy"" seem too concerned with framing witticisms and intelligent sarcasm for Ellen Page's character to pay any attention to the story's realism, it's true emotional and spiritual appeal. Realism in cinema is generated by a combination of factors, the foremost of which, most feel, is acting. Sadly, the steady stream of clever, scathing one liners delivered in a sadistic whisper by Page gets very old very quickly, due both to the over the top script, and her immature style. People in the theater were laughing at her ridiculous character when the director intended them to be spellbound. Combine the poor personalities of the film with the cheap photographic gimmicks (I was squinting at all the extreme close-ups) and you have an effort that seems more like a self indulgent horror flick than a genuine psychological thriller. Hayley Stark should have put more effort into expressing moral outrage at the horrible crime of child exploitation than delivering her fanciful rhetoric.

To carry the story, the movie keeps upping the violence along with the physical and psychological torture of a main character. This film lacks the depth of earlier films, such as ""The Pillow Book,"" which also seek to shock the audience by trying to making each scene more perverse than the previous one.Many professional critics like this film. As a member of the general public, odds are that you will leave the theater feeling depressed and cheated by the story (and especially the ending).Sandra Oh makes a very brief appearance, primarily to give the film some name recognition (and presumably to attract financing for this independent film), in a fungible role that could have been played by almost any 30+ year old actress.",Hard Candy
708,jrvilla-72553,This movie has more issues than Haley,1,13 January 2017,"A pedophile is classified as someone who is attracted to pre-pubescent children (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedophilia). This man appears to be a hebephile which is someone who is attracted to pubescent teenagers (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebephilia). While it is against the law for this man to have sex with children that young, it is not necessarily a mental disorder or something that needs to be ""punished""--especially with the ferocity that Haley displays (see the ""Variation of Normal"" section on the Wikipedia page). In fact, it is not unheard of throughout history for females around Haley's age (14) to be mothers (which meant they had sex). In addition, many people believe that it is likely that females around Haley's age do have the ability to consent due to the fact that they can comprehend what sex is at an intellectual and physical level. To put Jeff in the category of offending pedophiles is both factually and morally incorrect. For this reason, I believe that this movie shows an astounding lack of understanding about this topic. I would even say that it butchers this hard-to-talk-about issue in a way that is damaging to productive discussion.The plot shows basically no sophistication or maturity which, again, does not contribute to a productive discussion. This is glaringly obvious by the fact that there was basically no empathy for Jeff--even when the movie suggested that the sum of his crimes were having consensual sex with underage girls. Right before the end, he confesses that he was an accessory to the murder of one of these girls. However, the movie seems to suggest that this fact is an inevitability--as if most men like him are violent killers. And yet, it's very likely that many places in your bloodline involve a girl her age bearing a child with a man who was 20+. It's also very likely that these instances could have been in the context of a marriage--and even a relatively loving and caring one.I think this movie's best quality is a good example of how not to talk about this subject.",Hard Candy
709,BesmirchedTea,Simply awful.,1,20 September 2006,"Hard Candy is a film about whether you can torture someone into admitting crimes they didn't commit. Unfortunately, in this film, the torturer turns out to be the hero... A hero I was never behind for a minute. Over the top acting on a predictable script, so many impossibilities and plot holes that it is hard to suspend disbelief for very long, and a leading lady that looks like a boy all add up to a miss. The only surprise in the film for me was that she didn't reveal herself to be a boy after all this. The lighting was not bad at all, though. That's the one point that I gave this horrible piece of work. Never have the words ""an hour and a half of my life that I'll never get back"" been more deserved.However, if you are a teenage girl with notions of vigilante vengeance, this movie might give you some confidence, since she superhumanly pulls it off with barely a scratch. You wonder why this child genius is not working for the police already, since she is able to solve a crime weeks before the homicide unit can.Since the girl is 14, there is no nudity, no sex, relatively little violence, not even much swearing. I don't know why this thing is rated R, except to fool people into thinking it might be some kind of suspense thriller. It is clearly a PG13, and is safe for teens to watch...If Haley really wanted to torture Jeff, she should have just shown him this film. He would have admitted anything at that point.",Hard Candy
710,anymoviewilldo,Contrived?,5,17 June 2006,"I was quite surprised when I went to see this film having read a number of glowing reviews but ended up feeling utterly disappointed by what I got.Where I felt the film was letting the subject matter down was in it's use of contrived speeches taken direct from the mouths of Anti-Paedophile lobbyists and regurgitated through the mouth of a 14 year old girl, there was something disturbing in this manipulation that is not fair to the audiences intelligence nor to the portrayal of a supposedly 14 year old girl. I felt like I was listening to one of those family values anarchists who preach moral living and the protection of our children from evil paedophiles as they can attack at any time.Another point would be the lack of any ill feeling for Jack, it seemed for me that as the film wore on it was creating sympathy for him as the victim of some evil torture by a sycophantic teenager gone mad for the day. In no way was I ever convinced that this man was a paedophile and the ""why didn't you run line?"" seemed such a poor script tool to lead into his 'obvious' guilt I was left utterly dumbfounded by the time the end happens, he kills himself, she has exacted some moral revenge and goes back to living a normal life as any expert in torture would.Such an ill conceived plot line, very weak arguments in the script, a lack of balance to an issue that is very important all add up to this being just more evidence of the poor state of our society's view of our children, they are not little innocent angels until they hit the age of consent and then suddenly their mature enough to sleep with whom ever they like and this is where society seems to miss the point. If you ever want to see something that highlighted our very misguided view of our children then watch 'Brass Eye', at least then it may make some people look at the way they view their children and how the media sensationalises even minor incidents that may effect our children.Paedophilia and child abuse are very important subjects but I just didn't feel this film or script was able to do them justice, demonstrating a girl torturing a man for being a so-called paedophile then just walking away at the end into the sunset just didn't seem to take the issue anywhere, in fact for myself it has not provided any further insights into the issue as I hoped it would have done. Unfortunately I think there are lots of people who will jump up with glee at a 14 year old torturing this grown man for trying to molest her but in honesty if she is too innocent to be having sexual relations with the man I'm sure she's too innocent to be using psychological and physiological torture to get her way with him. Another one for the scrap heap I'm afraid.",Hard Candy
711,vagittarius,"Could have been wonderful, but unfortunately failed.",3,5 December 2006,"This movie could have been great. The idea was excellent, the suspense was excellent, the talent was a perfect choice. But the film lost everything it could have had to the badly, badly acted dialogue. It's difficult to enjoy a movie that tries to be ""intellectual"" with its dialogue when it's really just piling on top of ten or so years of cliché, pseudo-intellectualism. The girl was so annoying when she was supposed to be scary and intense, I almost had to turn off the DVD. Besides that, the suspense was very good, and the premise was very original for a film, but the acting, while it would have been okay for an actual 14-year-old, is mediocre when you realize the actress was 18 when the film was released. If I was in the theater when I saw this I would have thrown my soda at the screen.As for the ending... right up until the last few minutes, the film had redeemed itself, and then some details are revealed that make the whole story pretty meaningless. I'm sorry. I get a little upset when I've committed my time to seeing a film and it disappoints THIS much.",Hard Candy
712,dthStaR,"(Hard Candy) is extremely well acted, directed, edited and .. should really not be seen by anyone other than those in the mood for some intense, gut-wrenching horror.",8,15 April 2006,"Haley (Page) is more than the average 14 year old. Sure, she likes all the pop bands that a teenage girl should, dresses to the role of a freshman in high school and all that, she is impressively well read, smart, and witty. She knows what she wants, and at this point in time, it is Jeff (Wilson), a 32 year old photographer who has befriended Haley after meeting online. The movie opens with Jeff and Haley deciding to meet up at a local coffee shop where they talk and decide that it's probably best if they drive to Jeff's place and get to know each other a little better. The movie at this point proves disturbing just because of the burning desire to grab this girl and scream ""Don't do that"" in her face... but as the movie continues, it becomes abundantly clear that Haley is the one in control the whole time.I really don't want to give anything away other than my thoughts on the movie, ultimately... because if, and when you see this, it is best to go into this with as little spoiled as possible. The entire movie only features four people with speaking roles, and the two who are not Page and Wilson hardly have any screen time at that. Regardless, Haley and Jeff have some extremely fantastic exchanges of dialog, and the roles played by both are just short of perfection. Page plays the part of a teenage nymphomaniac superbly, and Wilson is without a doubt one of the most convincing pedophile turned victims in modern cinema. What I'm getting at, is that these are two roles that Hollywood has yet to mainstream.. at least on the screen together, successfully- until now.This film is impressive. It is extremely well acted, directed, edited and .. should really not be seen by anyone other than those in the mood for some intense, gut-wrenching horror. It is at this moment where I am trying to sum up the film, however, and can not. There is no one real moment that sits on top of everything else, but rather the culmination of so many things coming together at once-- from the tone, to the actions delivered on film, this is one film that I am glad I saw, but would think twice before recommending it to anyone aside from those knowing what they're getting themselves into.Bitter is the best way to describe it, really; Such a fantastically delivered film, but so horrendous in its subject matter and approach. It wasn't until the ride back that I realized the best way to put it into words, thinking back to the people walking out in the middle of the film, and the end when the audience didn't really know what to do but get up and evacuate the theatre as quickly as possible, that Hard Candy is/was the reason to see horror movies. You keep searching from one film to the next for that one movie that just.. messes with your head. Not necessarily the one that scares you, but the one that doesn't let you smile for the next two or three days... and that movie is Hard Candy. I know that there are already reviews saying that the characters are shallow, the plot is too edgy, what have you.. and I will tell you that if you like horror or stories that push the boundaries, this is your movie.",Hard Candy
713,gdawz,"Suggested title change: ""The Brown or Orange Wrapped Candies You Get On Halloween""",5,29 April 2006,"In brief: Hard Candy succeeded in making me feel nothing at all. I didn't waste my 10.75, but I won't be recommending this movie to any of my friends, and if asked how it was, I will shrug my shoulders.At length: The first comparison to this film that comes to mind is Hostel. Hostel also featured a fairly isolated cast (though not as slim as in Hard Candy), characters with whom it's difficult to feel truly sympathetic, and scenes of torture during which you don't have much hope for the victim. The second comparison that jumps out is Happiness, and not just because the main character is a pedophile, but also because the director attempts to make you empathize with said pedophile. I think both of the above films are amazing, mainly for their psychological terseness, and how deftly the subject matters are juggled within the confines of each film. I think Hard Candy aimed for this kind of balance, but forgot that you need more than an off-kilter setup to make a film.Two things came out as warning signs as the movie started - 1.the writer and the director were two different people. This wouldn't make a difference, normally, but for some reason, as the credits flitted by, it mattered. A feeling started settling in - that the look and feel of the film (the director) would be wholly separated from the meaning of the film (the writer). The opening credits - a red square that keeps shifting behind constantly evolving geometric wire shapes - seemed to emphasize this feeling even more.2.the previews for the movie were pretty much the whole opening scene. I get it - showing any further clips would've ruined the ""surprise"" when Hayley turns on her predator. It felt rushed all the same.And so we get to the main problem: the film works itself into a corner. It's very focused on the one long scene that plays itself out through the course of the movie, and I understand that adding in anything else - another character, more background information - would've distracted the viewer from the moral battle taking place during this scene.Unfortunately, due to this...Hard Candy is not really suspenseful, it's not really dramatic, it's not exciting, it's not horrifying, it's not painful to watch or bad, it's just really not that much of anything. The characters were obviously written to both be flawed but likable, but it just didn't work. You don't find yourself rooting for either one at any given point. They just exist on the screen, going through the motions regardless of whether or not you're watching. The writer had an interesting idea for a premise (even though the concept of the prey becoming the predator is well used, this was a new spin on it), but then seemed to realize that the audience is probably going to want some form of explanation. Er... insert several long and pointless expositions on each character's behalves, do some choppy editing... bingo. End of film. Again, Hard Candy tries to save itself by providing an ambiguous ending that will ""keep you talking for days after you leave the theater"", but not really. It's just ambiguous. It's just shoulder-shruggy. What was the point? The two actors, thankfully, are great with their somewhat one-dimensional characters, and are well cast. The 14 year old is hot, and the pedophile is hot and nice but creepy. The director was smart with pacing and color and camera movement. So, on the whole, watching the film was easy. And yes, I crossed my legs during the castration scene.Thus, 99 minutes passed and I don't regret it. However, my main criteria for judging a movie as good or bad is whether or not it was entertaining. In regards to Hard Candy... I shrug my shoulders.",Hard Candy

Once in a great while there comes a performance of such depth accomplished with such ease that I just want to thank the heavens for giving me the gift of warship--this is one of those times.

717,ben76,Superb performances but the style left me underwhelmed,6,17 June 2006,"It may seem crazy but I actually took a girl on a first date to see this movie. Interestingly she said she felt Hard Candy was more of a woman's film which I guess is understandable as the movie involves an alleged sexual predator, for which women are predominantly the victims or 'targets' - although what Hard Candy achieves very well is seamlessly showing the scenario from both angles. I found myself almost swapping sides as the movie unfolded, and not just once.Ultimately I was not overwhelmed by Hard Candy I'm afraid, partly due to my personal disliking of the style it adopted. When there's a fast moving scene I like to see the person running clearly, rather than this shaky, grainy close up effect with lots of quick cut aways - but that is a personal preference. Again from a style perspective I felt the movie adopted grey and dull colours too much leaving it feeling very independent and almost dirty if that makes sense. I can perhaps understand the directors reasoning for this but it just left me coming away feeling quite bad rather then a feeling of 'wow' which I think this movie could have achieved (and I'm sure will achieve for those that like these particular stylized looks).What I cannot praise enough are the performances. The film is essentially a two-hander and both the leads perform their roles to pretty much perfection. They are subtle and understated with moments of real flare but maintaining a consistency to their respective characters. The fact that throughout the film I couldn't decide who I felt should 'win' is a testament to the performances and the writing. This is not a simple good guy/bad guy movie - it's much more clever than that.Ultimately I respect this movie although I can't say I enjoyed it enough to rate it higher than a 6. It is certainly worth watching but I wouldn't rush to the cinema for it.",Hard Candy

720,magquatre84,pretentious,1,2 October 2006,"It was fun seeing little Trina Lahey from trailer park boys, but her character was beyond pretentious. Yeah, i was rooting for the pedophile the whole movie. Say what you want about me, but if i were him i would have totally had revenge. God, i wished the pedophile stabbed her in the face. Or at least snapped her neck when he pulled that leg-head- lock on her. I was anticipating that jet li move the second that scene started. i would have done it. No little girl could actually pull that off, and the directors/writers of this film were so damn pretentious spitting this preachy crap on film. Who cares.So here's how my vote works: +4 stars for casting Jim Lahey's daughter +5 stars for the pedophile's acting ( it was good) -4 stars for the retarded dialogue and witty comments by Trina Lahey. -2 stars for not having a single black person on film (racist) -10 thousand stars for getting all preachy in your face about pedophiles -10 Arcturus stars for the guy not doing succeeding with the jet Li head-snapping maneuver",Hard Candy

Outside of the castration scene, which lasted 50 minutes or so.Basically the film makers go through a lot of gimmicky devices to get the viewers engaged on a purely physiological level- by grossing you out. Emotionally, however, there is very little going on. Neither character really changes, and there is zero character development to go along with it.In conclusion- this movie sells itself on a great premise but fails to deliver where it counts - story and character.
