0,MartinHafer,Just not all that fun compared to most other similar Disney films,6,4 February 2015,"I appreciated one reviewer who said that they thought this film was perhaps targeted more to adults. As a child, I really didn't like this film and thought maybe it was just me, but over the years I've learned that others grew up feeling the same way. The prettier and more detailed Disney animation of the 30s and 40s here gives way to a much simpler and more garishly colored art style that screams 'MODERN'--but lacks charm. As for the film's plot and characters, aside from Maleficent, the rest are an incredibly dull and cheerless group. Princess whatsherface is dull and like too many Disney princesses, is way too passive--waiting for a hero-type to rescue her. All in all, I don't hate this film but there isn't much to make me like it, either. I have no idea why this film has achieved classic status other than it is old.",Sleeping Beauty
1,TheLittleSongbird,My personal favourite of the early Disneys,10,22 February 2009,"Everything about this film is beautiful. The characters, the music and the animation.The animation was lovely. It looks flat to some people, but to me it looks absolutely beautiful, and has a gorgeous stylistic look. The best scenes were actually the darker scenes, especially the climax, which is one of Disney's best. But I have to say the forest is one of the most beautifully animated forests in a Disney film. Sleeping Beauty mayn't have the strongest story development in a Disney movie, but neither the ballet or the fairytale have the best story development either, no matter how beautiful the film really is.The characters were unforgettable. Whilst Aurora was the weakest character, she was made into a beautiful woman with lots of grace, class and charm, who dreamed of falling in love, and Mary Costa's vocals were sublime. Phillip is also well done, but these two characters don't say much in comparison, I noticed, except Phillip has some great lines. The forest scene with the animals was charming, and you have to laugh at the three fairies when they tried to make the dress. The fairies added a huge amount to this film, as did Meleficent, who terrified me when I was younger. There was a long time when I was so scared of her and the part when she entices Aurora to the spinning wheel, that I refused to see the film for about two years.The music by Tchaikovsky was outstanding. He is a fantastic composer, one of my all time favourites. The music to the climax has been imitated by many Disneys but never as well. I recommend you see the ballet, which bears little resemblance to the film itself, but the music is a knockout, like Beethoven's Choral Symphony.In conclusion, an ambitious(being the most expensive Disney project) but beautiful film, that has captivated me since I was little, and I am 16 now. 10/10.

2,Leofwine_draca,Animation from Disney's golden age,6,7 May 2017,"SLEEPING BEAUTY is a Walt Disney animation that harks back to the golden age of the studio, before it became a populist sell-out for the masses. I'm no fan of these twee animations in general, but even I can admit that this is a well-made and well-animated production, questionable morals aside. Certainly the 1950s concerns of the day - presenting beauty as the main thing to be wished for by a girl - are dated, sexist, and old-fashioned, but this is also what makes the film an interesting time capsule.The film features one too many cute animals for my liking, and the handsome prince is a dolt. I found the protagonist rather smug and irritating. But the fairy godmothers are endearing creations and the use of the Tchaikovsky soundtrack is very good, although I would have preferred to listen to the straight music without the addition of the needless sung lines. Still, the character of Maleficent is one of the most striking in all Disney, and SLEEPING BEAUTY is a harmless enough piece of entertainment for the masses.",Sleeping Beauty
3,SnoopyStyle,old fashion Disney classic,7,3 December 2014,"King Stefan and Queen Leah finally has a child, Princess Aurora. At her christening, she is betrothed to boy Prince Phillip, the heir to neighboring King Hubert. The three good fairies Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather bless the child with gifts. Before Merryweather gives her blessing, the evil fairy Maleficent interrupts and curses the princess with death before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday as she pricks her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel. Merryweather uses her blessing to alter the curse to a deathlike sleep from which she can be awakened by true love's kiss. The three fairies comes up with a scheme to turn into humans and raise the girl as their own.This is definitely an old fashion fairy tale where the princess is rescued by her prince. The songs are old fashion but 'Once Upon a Dream' is still great. The hand drawn animation is beautiful. Maleficent is a great villain. The three fairies aren't nearly funny enough. Nevertheless this is a classic although it is of its times.",Sleeping Beauty
4,Hitchcoc,Not a Top 5 but Does a Pretty Good Job,8,14 December 2016,"Disney did so many great things that, for me, some don't quite catch me. Maybe it's the story. Maybe it's the music. Maybe it's a simple lack of the edginess that many of the great one's films often have, but there is something that isn't quite as sharp in this one. Also, I feel the animation isn't as crisp as many of the other films. The story, of course, is that a poor young woman is doomed to sleep for many years after a witch has been crossed. It's an example of how you can do everything you can, but fate steps in and messes with you. But it's a fairy tale that we all know, and things will eventually be dealt with. I feel very positively about this movie; it's just not my favorite. Hooray for Tchaikovsky.",Sleeping Beauty
5,lee_eisenberg,What if an entire entity slept for 100 years in real life?,5,11 May 2006,"You know the drill: witch puts death curse on princess, fairy softens it to sleep, and whole castle goes to sleep. As I learned in a fairy tale class in Lewis & Clark College just this past semester, some people think that the original fairy tale may have been about sexual maturation, the way she goes to sleep and wakes up a new person. Certainly sleep is a non-productive period, providing an opportunity for rebirth, perhaps? As for the spindle, that presents an interesting aspect: spinning was almost exclusively done by peasant women, so was it saying that if a princess tries to engage in it, strange things will happen? Does the curse mean that she'll never be able to do work that women are supposed to do? And the whole part about getting pricked by it: was that a sexual innuendo? The whole part about the castle shutting down while she sleeps provides food for thought. While we were discussing ""Sleeping Beauty"" and its variants in the fairy tale class in early April, I noted that if an entire castle - or other such entity - had fallen asleep exactly one century earlier and just now woken up, they would have missed the entire 20th century (and specifically, they would have just missed the Great San Francisco Earthquake). So, everyone on earth would have to explain everything that happened throughout the 20th century and first few years of the 21st century (I would hope to be the one to explain popular culture). I just imagine the people from the entity being all like: ""Whoa. That was one weird century that we missed. So no one ever found Jimmy Hoffa?"" What I'd like to see happen when everyone goes to sleep is a ""Psycho"" spoof. Someone's walking down the street, when suddenly, s/he feels tired. The ""Psycho"" music starts playing. With his/her last bit of strength before dozing off, s/he grabs a towel, and pulls a bottle of red wine off of a counter. The bottle crashes to the ground and the wine runs down into a drain.Back to the movie itself. There's pretty much everything that we can expect in a Disney version of a fairy tale: the virtuous princess is beautiful (or at least what our society considers beautiful), the cool prince is one handsome dude, the evil witch wears all black (remember, this is before anyone thought about political correctness) and talks like Endora on ""Bewitched"", the good fairies have the sort of relationship with each other than Gilligan and the Skipper have with each other, and the side characters exist mainly for comic relief. The movie really sets itself up to get mocked, and I threw out comments at it like Mike, Servo and Crow do with the movies that Dr. Forrester sends them on ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"". Among my comments were: (when Prince Philip offers his horse extra oats and carrots): ""Bribery?! Duke Cunningham went to jail for that!""*; (when the good fairies are talking about how Maleficent only understands hate and evil): ""Gee, Maleficent sounds like the Bush administration."" The whole part about the fairies trying to live like ""mortals"" sounds so much like ""Bewitched"" that it's debatable whether that's worth joking about. And when someone describes the 14th century as ""the present""...well, let's just say that in the 14th century, I couldn't have written this review because IMDb.com didn't exist! Anyway, I guess that this is mainly worth seeing as a look at that era in cinema. I will admit that Aurora is pretty hot.*In case you haven't been following the news, Duke Cunningham was a congressman (and Jack Abramoff crony) who recently got sent to jail for accepting bribes. When Walt Disney first released ""Sleeping Beauty"", he probably never guessed that someone would review it and mention those creeps. But hey, this is the 21st century, so what this movie portrays becomes even more of a fantasy.",Sleeping Beauty
6,jboothmillard,Sleeping Beauty,8,20 September 2005,"I saw this classic Disney animation many times during my childhood, based on the famous fairytale by the Brothers Grimm, but I knew I needed to see it again before seeing Angelina Jolie in Maleficent, the re-imagining of the same story with the villain at the centre, so I did. Basically King Stefan (Taylor Holmes) and Queen Leah (Verna Felton) after many years are happy to have been blessed with their first child, a daughter, they name her Aurora, a holiday is declared for her and the kingdom gather for her christening, the child is betrothed to young Prince Phillip, the son of King Hubert (Bill Thompson). Also attending the celebration are the three good fairies, Flora (Verna Felton), Fauna (Barbara Jo Allen) and Merryweather (Barbara Luddy), who with their magic bless her with gifts, Flora gives the gift of beauty, Fauna gives the gift of song, but before Merryweather can give her gift the evil Maleficent (Eleanor Audley) appears, upset by her refused invitation she curses the newborn princess. Maleficent proclaims that before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday she will prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and die, after she leaves however Merryweather alters this curse with her gift, she changes the fate to have Aurora not die, but to fall into deep sleep until she is awoken by true love's first kiss. The King orders all spinning wheels to be burned, but the fairies know it is not enough to prevent the curse, so after discussion they decide the princess will be safer growing up with them in a secluded woodcutter's cottage in the forest, they will live as mortals with her until the day of her sixteenth birthday. The years pass and Aurora (Mary Costa), renamed Briar Rose, has grown into a beautiful, sweet, gentle and kind young woman, Flora, Fauna and Merryweather plan to surprise her for her birthday with a dress and a cake, so they send her out to prepare the surprise party. Rose singing in the forest attracts the attention of the now handsome young man Prince Phillip (Bill Shirley) out riding his horse Samson, she talks to the woodland animals about wishing to fall in love, while singing they meet and instantly fall in love, unaware they are already betrothed, but she must return home, so tells him to meet her at the cottage later. The fairies meanwhile have made a mess of making a cake and a dress without magic, so they finally decide to use their wands, while Fauna makes the cake Flora and Merryweather argue about the dress colour being pink or blue, and their wand battle, and magic coming out of the chimney is spotted by Maleficent's raven Diablo. Rose returns home happy that she has fallen in love, the fairies, unaware it was Prince Phillip, explain she is Princess Aurora and is betrothed, with the raven listening, told never to see the young man she met again she leaves the room heartbroken, and Phillip meanwhile tells his father he has met a ""peasant girl"" who he wants to marry, ignoring the arranged marriage, Hubert fails to convince him otherwise and Phillip leaves to find her. Heartbroken Aurora is taken back to the kingdom, in the castle the fairies leave her a moment to sob, and Maleficent appears, putting the princess into a trance to follow her up the staircase to a room where a spinning wheel appears, and she is made to prick her finger on the spindle, fulfilling the curse. The fairies place the sleeping Aurora on a bed in the highest room of the tallest tower, and to avoid anyone finding out the fairies cast a spell to put all people in the kingdom into a deep sleep until the curse is broken and Rose is awakened, before falling asleep Hubert mentions Phillip meeting a ""peasant girl"", and realising the young man she mentioned was Phillip they race back to the cottage. Phillip is kidnapped by Maleficent's goon and taken to her lair in the Forbidden Mountains, following Maleficent to the dungeon the fairies overhear her explain to Phillip that the peasant girl is the princess, and that she plans to imprison him until he is an old man close to death to meet his sleeping love, who will not have aged a day, and she leaves delighted in his rage. The fairies release Phillip and arm him with a Shield of Virtue and Sword of Truth, after battling the minions and Merryweather turning raven Diablo into stone Maleficent discovers the prince escaping, she surrounds Stefan's castle with a forest of thorns, but this does not stop him, so Maleficent transforms into a gigantic fire-breathing dragon to battle him herself, but he defeats her, with the help of magic, throwing the sword into her heart, she falls to her death and her body disintegrates to ash. Phillip finds Princess Aurora and awakens her with true love's first kiss, the spell is broken and the people of the kingdom also wake up, the couple enter the palace ballroom, and after reuniting with the parents Phillip and Aurora dance, the argument of colours resumes between Flora and Merryweather, but Princess Aurora and Prince Phillip live happily ever after. Also starring Marvin Miller as the Narrator. The characters are definitely why the film works, the fairies adding both resource and comic relief, and of course horned Maleficent being the iconic self-proclaimed Mistress of All Evil, the film apparently took ten years to make and was not a big success on it's release, now it is seen as a great, with splendid animation techniques, charming storytelling and great music, including the most memorable song ""Once Upon a Dream"", I am really glad I watched again, a terrific animated fantasy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Music for George Burns. Very good!",Sleeping Beauty
7,ccthemovieman-1,This High-Def Transfer Will Blow You Away!,9,7 December 2008,"Quick......what was ""Sleeping Beauty's"" name? Answer: Either ""Princess Aurora"" or ""Rose,"" depending on where she was.Most of you probably know that but I didn't, probably because I hadn't watched this movie since it came out about a half century ago! I was a little kid, and never did see this again on TV or VHS. I only saw it again because several high-definition DVD websites said this looked spectacular on Blu-Ray.How right they were; this looks incredible! I cannot believe how fantastic the artwork is, and sharp the picture comes through on this restored high-def disc. The colors and the amount of details in all the art are astounding. Many of the scenes had my jaw dropping in admiration. The story, frankly, is not anything that great for a man my age but the visuals are so fantastic that I enjoyed the experience.I also appreciated the 2.55:1 widescreen picture. If you've only seen this on formatted-to-TV 4:3, and love the movie, you owe it to yourself to see this version. You won't believe how good this 1959 film looks.",Sleeping Beauty
8,Tweekums,A charming Disney classic,9,4 December 2019,"This Disney classic tells the story of Princess Aurora. When she was a baby the great and the good gathered to celebrate... the wicked fairy Maleficent definitely wasn't invited but she turned up anyway and cursed the baby. On the day of her sixteenth birthday she is doomed to prick her finger on a spinning wheel and die. A good fairy manages to modify the curse so she will only fall asleep till kissed by her true love. In an attempt to avoid the curse the king has every spinning wheel destroyed and Aurora is raised in secret by the three good fairies deep in the forest. As she grows up she has no idea of her true identity. Her sixteenth birthday approaches and Maleficent searches for her while preparations are made for her to return home to her royal family to marry a prince... something complicated by the fact that she has met a handsome stranger in the forest.At sixty years of age this film has obviously dated in some departments; however it is still a delight and the animation is very impressive... especially when you consider the fact that it was all drawn by hand. The story is a lot of fun with elements of threat and romance. Maleficent is a great villainess, scary in a way that isn't too frightening for children. The excitement rises impressively towards the end as the hero rushes to save our heroine. The three good fairies, Flora, Fauna and Merryweather are a lot of fun. Aurora isn't the strongest of heroines but that doesn't matter too much as the story demands that she is a vulnerable characters. The songs do show their age but are solid enough. Overall a high quality offering from Disney which fans of the studio's works are sure to enjoy.",Sleeping Beauty
9,moonspinner55,Some truly beautiful moments,7,3 September 2001,"Widescreen Disney animated fairy tale with music classily adapted from Tchaikovsky has three good fairies sheltering a princess, who has been doomed by a curse. Free of the usual Disney manipulations, but also a little short on humor. One of the fairies constantly grumbles in a snit, there's a slapstick wand fight, but that's about it in the fun & games department. The backgrounds are angular and subdued, and that fits well with the more-or-less serious tone, but interest starts to wane with about 15 minutes to go. There are some lovely set pieces: the burning of all the spinning wheels shown in longshot, the entire village falling asleep at once, the raven circling the forest looking for Aurora, seeing lights blazing through the brush. The music is gorgeous and the voice-work impeccable. *** from ****",Sleeping Beauty
10,dbdumonteil,Scary Maleficent.,9,13 September 2001,"This is my favourite Disney movie.I saw it when I was 8,and that was the first movie which scared me to death.Back home at night,I was afraid of the dark,I could not turn off the light,because I was afraid of Maleficent.One scene would go well in any horror movie:Princess Aurora ,spellbound,comes up the stairs,and arrives in a room.Maleficent is hidden in the fireplace,you can only see her eyes..Absolutely frightening!I saw it again at 18,and although I had grown up(!) I was scared almost the same way.I cannot think of any baddie ,any villain in the Mouse House that can equal this witch.She's got some kind of vamp's face-not as ugly as Snowwhite's evil queen-,and her horns add to her satanic(sadistic) look.When she becomes a dragon,the terror she generates is not as intense because a dragon remains a dragon,even if it's more successful than Mim's metamorphosis in ""Sword in the stone"".The rest of the movie seems rather nice,compared to the movie's baddie.Tchaikowsky's waltz is tastefully used ,and adds lustre to a pretty bland pair of lovers.The three good fairies-three Cinderella's godmothers for the price of one- are funny and charming and God knows how much we need them as a relief in the nightmarish world of Maleficent and her demons.A question remains:at the time,was it really a movie for children?Now time has passed ,the kids have seen worse.But I keep on thinking it was a bit too much for the brat I was in 1960.",Sleeping Beauty
11,Quinoa1984,"... not really the classic I was expecting, even in full widescreen",6,23 June 2010,"For fans of Sleeping Beauty, the latest DVD release from Disney- one of their ""Platinum"" editions with 2 discs and games and so on- is worth full price. It gives the fans a chance to see the film as it was originally intended for theaters, in a 2:20:1 aspect ratio (even slimmer than 2:35, think the aspect ratio of Ben-Hur for comparison), and all of the cinematic detail, of the backgrounds and the characters in the foreground, is all there with digitally restored picture and sound. If nothing else, even as I didn't care for the film itself very much, it is worth sort of rejoicing. Sort of.I didn't like the movie (!) Yes, not by a lot. Compared to the other Disney films of the period, even with the other Princess films (Snow White and Cinderella, even if they aren't princesses all the way through), this one falls short. The main characters are bland, even by Disney standards which for protagonists, ESPECIALLY the male prince characters, are without personality. Watching these characters do little on screen but prance in the woods and immediately fall in love just made me think fondly of other Disney films, including the ""new"" crop from the past twenty years like The Little Mermaid and Aladdin, which have similar fantastic stories and one-dimensional leads only given more personality and depth and flaws.It's like Disney and his team took a lot of the elements from past films and cobbled them together. It's not that the film is even all bad, far from it. Any time Maleficent or her troll-like minions come on screen, or when the movie by proxy of her evil magic gets dark, suddenly the movie comes alive. Particularly so this happens when Princess Aurora, left alone in the room by her three good-hearted but dim-witted magic women, goes up the staircase following a green light in a trance (Vertigo, anyone?) And of course things are often beautifully animated, such as those backgrounds and the matte paintings. Other times- and I know I may get crap for this- it looks oddly cheap, dated.There is magic stuff here, and classic moments, and a scene with the two kings as they get drunk that's actually quite funny and lively and feels entertaining. But the rest of the film is a sort of plastic farce, where characters do stupid (or just Disney-generic) things and it takes so long to get to better parts that aren't clouded by ill-logic (i.e. the making-everyone-in-the-kingdom-asleep trick that seems kind of, I dunno, wrong on some level seeing it all grown up). Perhaps for kids it works much better, or for those who are only looking for some of the 'classic' Disney animation in full widescreen. But so much of it is lacking in ways that just elude me, and make me want to go back to the other Disney classics for better results.",Sleeping Beauty
12,JohnHowardReid,An entertainment masterpiece!,10,7 July 2017,"Copyright 1959 by Walt Disney Productions. New York opening at the Criterion: 17 February 1959. U.S. release through Buena Vista: March 1959. U.K. release through Walt Disney: 7 August 1959. Australian release through Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer: 24 December 1959. 75 minutes.SYNOPSIS: There is much rejoicing in the kingdom for a daughter is born to King Stefan and his queen. Both Stefan and visiting King Hubert, the ruler of a neighboring country, have long wished to unite their lands by the marriage of their children. On this occasion they announce the betrothal of young Prince Phillip to the infant Princess Aurora. Outside the castle, knights and their ladies, townspeople and peasants, join in a joyous processional. While the nobility are celebrating within the great hall, a shaft of light suddenly appears and floating down it come the tiny figures of three good fairies, Flora, Fauna and Merryweather. Waving their magic wands they bestow on the baby their favors: Flora, the gift of beauty; Fauna, the gift of song, but before Merryweather can bestow the gift of happiness, Maleficent, the evil witch, appears in a blinding flash of lightning. Angered at not being invited to the festivities she prophesies that before the sun sets on Aurora's sixteenth birthday she will prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and die. NOTES: ""Sleeping Beauty"", Walt Disney's $6,000,000 animated production in Technicolor and Technirama, is dormant in title only. Six years of sustained effort went into it. For Disney, who liked to tackle the impossible and usually achieved it, this cartoon feature was his most challenging. ""Hundreds of our top artists and craftsmen were involved in the picture"" Disney declared at the time. ""It took a million drawings to bring 'Sleeping Beauty' to life on the screen."" The big screen imposed tremendous added labors on the artists. They had to move their characters in larger fields of action. They had to create different color schemes and a new landscape for the classic tale. The mathematical calculations became much more intricate. Every phase of artistry and mechanics which together comprise the art of animation, the art of drawing in motion, had to be revamped. ""In fact, the most difficult barrier for the artists was to keep them from covering old ground used in former cartoon classics — to keep their concepts fresh and talents sharp."" Directing animator Marc Davis handled both Sleeping Beauty herself (otherwise known as both Princess Aurora and Briar Rose) and Maleficent. Helene Stanley was the live model for Beauty, whilst Jane Fowler posed for Maleficent and Ed Kemmer for the Prince.Filmed in Technirama 70mm, ""Sleeping Beauty"" was printed and projected anamorphically at an aspect ratio of 2.35:1. Initial worldwide film rentals gross returned only $5.3 million, a long way short of recouping the movie's $6 million negative cost, plus print, advertising and distribution overheads.COMMENT: This Disney DVD rates 10/10. The wide anamorphic screen is always full of movement. Absolutely chock-a-block. Never has the wide-wide screen been used so effectively — in either an animated or a live action film. Disney artistry at its super best, ""Sleeping Beauty"" is an entertainment masterpiece.",Sleeping Beauty
13,sunwarrior13,A Postwar Disney Classic,10,14 July 2015,"When Disney produced this fairy tale based on The Sleeping Beauty by Charles Perrault and Little Briar Rose by The Brothers Grimm,it spent $6 million which made it the most expensive animated movie during its time of release during the postwar in 1959.It contains amazing musical scores and songs that were adapted from the Sleeping Beauty ballet by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and memorable iconic characters such as Princess Aurora,Maleficent and Prince Philip.The story revolves around a young princess who was cursed a birth by an evil fairy,the baby was taken into custody by the three good fairies who took care of the her.Nevertheless,the baby still fell asleep at 16 and the evil fairy takes her into a prisoner.She could only be awakened by a kiss of a handsome prince.When the prince decides to rescue her,the evil fairy became a breathing dragon forcing a clash with the prince.This is definitely a postwar Disney classic that remains a masterpiece since it was first released more than fifty years ago.The songs,the sound and the grandeur remains magnificent despite using dated technology back then.Also,the actors/actresses who provided their voices that made many characters iconic for many years to come.",Sleeping Beauty
14,hitchcockthelegend,Beautiful Disney Production Of A Wonderful Fairytale.,9,20 August 2015,"When an evil witch places a curse on an infant princess that will cause her to fall into eternal sleep on her 16th birthday, her three fairy godmothers whisk her away to a life of normality and ignorance of her birthright. But can they stave off the curse when the 16th year of age arrives?It upped the ante in costing for Disney, also taking a decade to produce. The ambition was high as new techniques were being used such as rotoscoping, while the musical score is brilliantly devised from Tchaikovsky's Sleeping Beauty ballet. The story itself is a pure joy, based on Charles Perrault's ever enduring fairytale, it's awash with rich characters, led by the delightful three fairy godmothers - Flora - Fauna and Merryweather, all plumpy and sweet, while evil witch Maleficent is brilliantly produced, with a long pointy chin and devil horns on her head.There's a whole bunch of charming fun on show, as the three ladies bring the magic and potter around while gently ribbing each other, but it's with the drama where Sleeping Beauty most soars. The nightmare sequence luring Briar Rose (Princess Aurora) to the dreaded spinning wheel is unnerving, and the battle between Prince Phillip and Maleficent is exhilarating and shows the animators at their best. As for the colour? Spanking!Upon release it wasn't the roaring success Disney had hoped and planned for, but the decades since then have been very kind to Sleeping Beauty.

15,preppy-3,Not a classic but not bad,7,7 June 2014,"Disney version of the fairy tale. Princess Aurora is born and cursed (for no real reason) by evil Maleficent to die on her 16th birthday. Three fairies--Flora, Fauna and Merryweather--lessen the curse to just make her sleep, not die. Aurora grows up protected by the three fairies and then meets tall, handsome Prince Phillip--on her 16th birthday. They immediately fall in love but the curse comes to pass. Aurora falls into a deep sleep and only the kiss of the prince can awaken her. Phillip is set on awakening Aurora but he'll have to fight Maleficent to get her.This took six YEARS and millions of dollars to make. It was also the first animated movie to be released in widescreen (called Technirama 70). However it was not a hit critically or commercially...and it's easy to see why. The story is vague with plot holes and continuity lapses galore. The palace scenes are incredibly annoying. The main characters move fluidly but all the background characters don't move an inch. They look like what they are--drawings. The characters are either annoying (the fairies), bland (Aurora and especially Phillip) or just evil for no reason (Maleficent). On the plus side most of the animation is great and takes full advantage of the wide screen (do NOT see this in a pan and scan version). A highlight is the final battle between Phillip and Maleficent. The songs are tuneful (if forgettable) and the score is just fantastic. Also Maleficent is a great Disney villainess.So it is a very good Disney film but no classic.",Sleeping Beauty
16,CinemaSerf,"""It looks horrible..."" ""That's because it's on you, dear...""",7,1 April 2020,"Now then, for any fans of the more recent ""Maleficent"" films - this is how it is supposed to be done! I think this film goes a long way to explaining why I almost always support the baddies in films. A princess (""Briar Rose"") is born and the three good fairies are summoned to the Christening to bestow their blessings on the newborn. Just as the third is about to lavish her gift on the baby, the ominously evil witch arrives with her trusted black raven. Not invited, how rude - but she still generously gifts the child a Christening present. Needless (or should that just be needles?) to say, the spindling trade in the kingdom took a bit of a hit after that and the girl is secreted deep in forest trying to keep away from the dreadful consequences of this nasty curse. Amongst the best ever sequences in animation - the three fairies try to make a cake and a dress for her impeding 16th birthday and their efforts turn out to be disastrous. After 16 years - they resort to using their wands and we have five minutes of pure Disney magic. They cannot agree on a colour for the dress, have a bit of a magical colour-fight which is noticed by the evil sorceress's searching bird and their cunning secret is carelessly exposed... The colours, gently humorous dialogue and George Bruns' (with some Tchaikovsky) score makes this a thoroughly enjoyable fantasy romantic adventure - in my book, the best Walt ever produced.",Sleeping Beauty
17,dbborroughs,I find it too fake to be believed,3,20 January 2008,"Finally saw the Disney Sleeping Beauty tonight on ABC. I didn't think I'd like it so I never watched it.I was right.Granted the print was washed out, which is surprising since the film was just restored for DVD. The film was also the first widescreen and 70mm feature animated cartoon from Disney so watching the film was a trip since stuff was obviously off screen.I love Malificent and the dragon but for the most part I don't like the look of the film. Its too cartoony at times while other things like the design of the prince's face seems oddly out of place with the rest of the film. Yes he;'s closer to Malificent who is realistic, but everyone else is cartoon.(and I won't mention the horse) The pallet is closer to some of UPA films. It all feels mechanical.I intensely dislike the fact that basically the hero isn't very heroic, oh yes he does the hero stuff but he would have failed almost from the start had the fairies not been there. Even killing the dragon is done by the fairies. I will not read into this the feminist subtext of behind every man is a good woman, or in this case three. What a wimp.No there will be no rush by me to run out and pick up the film on DVD. I can only thank god that I do not have girlfriend/wife or female children who would make me watch this again. No its not as bad as say, oh, an Ed Wood movie, and no its just not that bad at all, its just fake magical and over rated.I hope never to see it again.",Sleeping Beauty

Lovely in every way with memorable characters and scenes that have stood the test of time. The animation is beautiful and stylish with rich, vibrant colors. The voice actors all do wonderful work. If I had a complaint, it would be that the narrator is rather bland. Someone with a stronger voice would have been better. But it's a minor thing in a film that is so wonderful from start to finish. The Tchaikovsky music is amazing and the song ""Once Upon a Dream"" is a real gem. I'm no film historian but it seems like, in many ways, this movie represents the end of an era for animated Disney films that began with Snow White in 1937. There would certainly be some great movies to come, even some classics, but they wouldn't have quite the same grand feeling and charming old-fashioned qualities of the films from this era.",Sleeping Beauty

To prevent this, her father the King sends her into the care of three good but bumbling fairy godmothers who raise her, but are still unable to prevent the curse, though Aurora's love Prince Philip will revive her with a kiss, if he can first survive the trap set for him by Maleficent, and then battle her when she transforms herself into a huge dragon.

20,Smells_Like_Cheese,A Disney classic,10,18 January 2004,"When I was a little girl, Sleeping Beauty was my all time favorite Disney film. I was so in love with this story, it's crazy how many times I wore out the VHS. But growing up, I lost touch with the story, but I recently bought the DVD and re-watched the film and you know what? I'm still in love with this movie. I really miss these old Disney movies where the animation was so bright and beautiful, the characters were so lovable, and the story was so magical. I'm not bashing Disney films from today, just I'm sure we could all relate on this subject where the older Disney films just had a certain charm about it. Sleeping Beauty is just a timeless story and has so much wonderful romance, I guess since I'm a girl, I just couldn't help but still be in love with this beautiful story.Princess Aurora is born and is the future queen of her land, three fairy's, Flora, Merryweather, and Fauna bless her with three gifts: beauty and song, right as Merryweather is about to bless Aurora, the evil witch, Maleficent, comes in and curses Aurora that she shall touch a spinning wheel by her 16th birthday and die! Merryweather changes it to where she won't die, but sleep and could only be woke up by the kiss of true love. The fairy's wish to keep this from happening still, so they take Aurora and raise her as their own. One day Aurora on her 16th birthday goes out in the forest and meets the charming and handsome Prince Phillipe, but she doesn't know he's a prince and she doesn't know he's fhe man she's actually betrothed too. She is told by the fairy's that she can never see him again and that she's a princess; later that night the curse happens! Now the fairy's need Phillipe to save Aurora before it's too late.Everything about Sleeping Beauty is just a perfect Disney film and I can't wait until to show this to my future kids one day. I know that their generation is going to have just the CGI animation, so it's good that at least we still have these films, they're treasures. The voices, the animation, the story, Sleeping Beauty is the most romantic fairy tale that anyone could easily fall in love with. If you are a Disney fan, this is a must see, it's a great family film or if you're just a film buff in general, I'm a grown up and I still tear up when I watch Sleeping Beauty.10/10",Sleeping Beauty
21,lasttimeisaw,a veritable delight among Disney's vast canon,7,24 May 2019,"A promenade into Disneyland of Clyde Geronimi's 2D SLEEPING BEAUTY, a vintage corker that relegates our titular beauty and her prince as token figurines, in lieu, three chipper fairy godmothers (Flora, Fauna and Merryweather) and the vile witch Maleficent upstage everyone else in their spirited good/evil dichotomy.Chromatically kaleidoscopic, its gorgeous palette has a revivifying effect on any jaded soul to ease into its family-friendly realm of fairy-tale, and tonally dulcet (if no number is near to become a timeless ear-worm), this cel animation bowls audience over in its diligent animation work (look fabulous for its time) and a seamless narrative that binds together a tight story with apposite spectacle at every corner and turn, notably for Maleficent's thoroughgoing unleash of her malevolence, she is the embodiment of true devil, and will be made into an unusual protagonist in Robert Stromberg's live action remake in 2014, which explores her side of heart-rending backstory and humanizes her as a more compassionate and complex individual that sublimates the definition of ""true love's kiss"" and subsequently spawns a franchise, with its second installment in the can.Whereas Princess Aurora and Prince Phillip are hampered by cardboard characterization, lulz oozes from the horseplay among the triad of fairies, despite that the movie sticks to stereotypes of gabby, fastidious or chubby middle-aged ladies. Pink or blue, which is the color of Aurora's dress? ultimately becomes a more imperative question than sleeping beauty's plight amid the hoopla of a traditional happily-ever-after story arc. A high water mark of 2D animation filmmaking at it time, SLEEPING BEAUTY is also a veritable delight among Disney's vast canon.",Sleeping Beauty
22,Rainey-Dawn,"Magic, Music & Maleficent",10,25 June 2014,"This is a good ""damsel in distress"" story filled with magic, music and Maleficent! I fell in love with this movie when I was a girl! The strangest part is I really liked the jealous Queen Maleficent just as much as Princess Aurora and ""Prince Charming"".The best scenes to me were the fairy's battle of the dress and the battle between Maleficent and the Prince. Both were extremely memorable and funny. I still have an unused postcard I acquired at Epcot that has the battle scene of Maleficent as the Dragon & the Prince. The songs aren't to bad... ""Once Upon A Dream"" to me is the best and a very beautiful song indeed! It was used in a most romantic moment in the film.All in all the is film great!

23,KineticSeoul,Well known fairy tale that is forgettable,5,23 September 2014,"This is a really simple story that doesn't seem to have all that much screen time when it comes to Sleeping Beauty. The character is just a super mystery to me, all I know is that she is royalty, she sings to forest animals and is interested in a Prince. Yeah, that is mostly any typical Disney princess, but nothing about Sleeping Beauty stands out. And the people that recognize her, only seem to recognize her for her beauty. Maleficent is the villain this time around, but nothing is really known about her. And her motives and incentives for her evil deeds just doesn't stand out much. As a matter of fact, when the movie ends I questioned her motives for what she did. But that is later more explained in ""Maleficent"" the live action movie. The tale of the Sleeping Beauty is a well known fairy tale, but I personally thought this animated Disney movie was actually quite forgettable. I give this movie a 5.4/10 because the animation was ahead of it's time.5.4/10",Sleeping Beauty
24,OllieSuave-007,Once upon a Disney Classic!,9,21 October 2013,"This is another classic from Walt Disney, a story about a princess who was placed on a sleeping spell from a snubbed, vengeful witch, Maleficent, in which only a prince can break.This movie has beautiful animation work, rich in color and very vibrant. I loved the artwork design of the castle, which served as an inspiration of the Sleeping Beauty castles you see in Disney theme parks around the world. The characters are memorable, especially the three good fairies, Flora, Fauna and Merriweather, who will suspend reality with magic they use like making a cottage clean by itself and counterattacking Maleficent's wicked tricks. Maleficent, I think, is one of the more notorious, yet memorable Disney villains. Prince Phillip was one of the Disney princes that actually takes on a more active role in a movie, as opposed to the more obscure princes in Snow White and Cinderella. And, the King and Queen gave an emblematic representation of what royalty typically looks like: gold crowns with flowing garbs, headdresses and capes, sitting on tall thrones. The music is superb, an adaptation of the Sleeping Beauty Ballet from Peter Tchaikovsky. The Waltz sung by Princess Aurora is my favorite piece in the movie. And, the story is fast-paced with an exciting rescue-the-princess and sword-wielding climax.The only downsides I think exists in this movie is that Princess Aurora (the Sleeping Beauty) had too little screen time and too much focus was on the Three Fairies. Also, it is said in the story that the King and Queen wanted badly to have a child. So, when Princess Aurora was born, the joy of having a child was short-lived because Aurora was taken into hiding by the fairies to escape Maleficent's curse; therefore, it is like the King and Queen got a raw deal out of this. But, other than that, a very satisfying movie that remains one of my favorite Disney classics.Grade A-",Sleeping Beauty
25,cherold,Entertaining Movie With a Small Role for the Princess,8,23 April 2014,"I don't think I ever saw this movie as a kid; that was back in the days when Disney wouldn't put their movies on TV, and I don't think I saw it in the theater. But I've become curious about the old Disney films, so I thought I'd take a look.While the title focuses on sleeping beauty, the movie itself focuses on good and bad magic, the good represented by three fairies, the bad by the wicked Malificent. This is fortunate, because the beauty and her love interest are painfully dull; Disney's attempt to create classically attractive people is rather unattractive.The fairies, on the other hand, are delightful and often quite funny, and Malificent is a wonderful character who I imagine would be rather scary for children. Outside of the two lovers, character design is very good, 50s-era design (things went downhill for Disney in the 60s). Some of the animation is impressive (particular scenes with Malificent). The music is rather unfortunate, featuring cheesy choral arrangements that represent the worst of that era's musical concepts, but overall this is very good. I still prefer the modern Disney of Frozen and Beauty and the Beast, but this is well worth watching.",Sleeping Beauty
26,Lejink,Some enchanted movie,8,11 April 2010,"For some reason, there's a whole swathe of classic 40's and 50's Disney classics I've not yet seen, including ""Cinderella"", ""Pinocchio"", ""Dumbo"", ""Bambi"", ""101 Dalmations"", ""The Lady & The Tramp"" and up until now, this lovely, warming re-telling of the classic ""love conquers all"" fairy tale.It's a long time since I've sat so rapt by a movie, an animated one at that, my eyes and ears never leaving the screen, even knowing as we all do, how the story ends. Delightfully old-fashioned, no doubt reflecting the solid family values of Eisenhower's late 50's America, I'll take ""Sleeping Beauty""'s wide-eyed innocence to today's knowing, post-modern cynicism and I speak as a fan of the whole ""Shrek"" franchise! Only once did I detect the encroachment of the modern, with references to ""this is the fourteenth century, you know!"", but this was only the mildest of jarrings if I'm being honest.The animation is delightful, particularly the backgrounds and there are some particularly eye-catching segments, two I particularly liked being the three good fairies' transformation into pixie-size and one of Malificent's entrances where she's reduced to a set of eye-slits and green light.Tchaikovsky's orchestral music is lovely, although some of the songs are a little starchy plus there's a bit too much of the young lovers' royal fathers if I'm carping, but with its gentle humour (""make it pink, make it blue"") and sheer Disney magic firmly in place, this delightful movie will waft all but the coldest heart to a lovely place long ago and far away.",Sleeping Beauty
27,ElMaruecan82,"If not the best, maybe the most defining classic of Disney's animated features ...",8,21 June 2013,"My first experience with ""Sleeping Beauty"" was at the end of my 2nd grade year, the film's magic simply blew my mind, the bell rung shortly after the christening part and we never could finish the film. Coincidentally, the same year, I saw the climactic fight with the dragon in a Disney TV's special yet the second act remained a total mystery and I never thought I missed much since I was already familiar with the best bits, including the incomparable Tchaikovsky's waltz theme of the same name. But after a series of missed opportunities, I finally watched Disney's ""Sleeping Beauty"" all the way.Still, it wasn't that new an experience, I remember being mesmerized by the TV versions of the classic fairy-tale, I saw two when I was 9, and the story had no secret for me, especially because the two films where relatively faithful to Perrault's original book (in one of them, Aurora was actually named 'Briar Rose' and I thought it was just an artistic license). Speaking of the story, I thought it was surprisingly dark, projecting our deepest fears like being struck by a malevolent curse such as the spindle of the wheel, and living in the constant fear that it would be complete, not to mention the creepy vision of a whole town put in a comatose state for a whole century, a device that a child could easily assimilate to death.Although it deviates from the original material, ""Sleeping Beauty"" magnificently renders the sinister atmosphere of the story and one of its strongest aspects relies on the depiction of magic through the eternal opposites: good and evil. Disney's animated movies have always provided the best art-form when it came to vehicle these fantastic elements and as a result, the animation is absolutely dazzling whether it induces fear of amazement. The three fairies are magnificently characterized thanks to the wise choice of reducing their number to three and making them physically different, and Maleficent has this mix of elegance and darkness that perfectly suits her status as a Disney villain. In fact, for a Disney film, the film gets strangely explicit by always referring to the antagonism between good and evil through the devilish incarnation of Maleficent, who's more than your usual Witch.And perhaps this is the main achievement of ""Sleeping Beauty"", to exploit familiar archetypes from previous Disney classics, without recycling them. Maleficent is a class on her own and is never comparable to the Evil Queen from ""Snow White"" and the three fairies are much more motherly and three-dimensional figures than the jolly Godmother from ""Cinderella"". ""Sleeping Beauty"" goes even further by eschewing one of the dullest archetypes from the other films: the nameless and bland Prince. This time, Philip, to name him, becomes the first truly heroic Prince of Disney, the one who really struggled to get to Aurora and bless her with a true love kiss. Released in 1959, after several years of preparation and pre-production, anyone could tell Disney wanted to make a new movie out of familiar material.Now, there are two aspects in the film that certainly divide opinions. One being the small screen-presence of Aurora, which probably suffers from the fact that the Prince, the fairies, Maleficent and even the Kings are given more preeminent roles. For some viewers, Aurora is dull, passive or under-developed at best. The second is animation, the realism of the background, the magnificent way it renders some of the most beautiful medieval paintings, and make you look at the film as a new milestone in Disney's canon, some might find it too linear or geometrical, foreshadowing the evolution of Disney's animation to a more sketchy format, and regret the most rounded aspect of Disney's previous film, the one that Disney Renaissance would resurrect with ""The Little Mermaid"".Characters and animation either support or cancel one another. I, for one, thought that the animation was perfect for the film, that ""Sleeping Beauty"" is a masterpiece on the animation level, even more impressive since the film was still hand-drawn and didn't rely on the Xerox process that would be used for ""One Hundred and One Dalmatians"". Known for being the first to be shot in Technirama process, the large scope of the film allowed the team to be more perfectionism in the depiction of backgrounds whether for castles or forests, multiplying by ten the delays of production. But for what a result! I can only envy those who saw the film in a large screen; no castle has even been more frightening than Maleficent's, conveying the Gothic atmosphere the story required. The same year than Ben-Hur, Disney proved to be capable of making blockbusters, technically speaking.And the drawing plays an interesting role, by canceling the eventual blandness of Aurora. She not only is the best-looking of all Disney princesses but her facial features also suggest a strongest and most modern personality, like a younger version of Lauren Bacall. Given the role she's supposed to have in the original story, the main players being the fairies, Maleficent and the Prince, her lack of screen-presence doesn't damage her characterization at all, hell, even her smile when she's waken up isn't the same ecstatic enthusiasm than Snow White but rather looks like a clever 'here you are' wink. The four roles are fairly distributed and the best thing it did was to spare us from too much cute little animals as time-fillers.If not as revolutionary as ""Snow White"" or as popular as ""The Lion King"", the film features three classic scenes, so-defining of what Disney stood for: the magic christening, the climactic good vs. bad battle, and naturally, the magnificent kiss. ""Sleeping Beauty"" uses all the archetypes of the fairy-tales and Disney previous successes and the result is a classic masterpiece of Animation, certainly the most defining of Disney, since even the castle where Aurora lies in the highest tower became Walt Disney's all-time trademark.",Sleeping Beauty
28,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"More like sleeping audience, am I right?",5,6 July 2020,"Aurora is a passenger in her own story, and not just because she spends a good portion of it asleep. The stuff that comes to mind first when you think of 'Sleeping Beauty (1959)' is actually reserved only for its final moments; most of the movie is about the three fairies who hide the eponymous princess from the well-designed but ultimately rather weak villain, Maleficent. That would be fine if it were the plot's main focus, but the narrative simply can't decide what it wants to centre around and, as such, ends up feeling aimless and almost segmented. To be honest, it's rather boring. The animation is mostly stiff (and feels strictly rotoscoped), the songs are unremarkable and the comedy falls flat. There are a few entertaining sequences, including a fire-and-brimstone finale that's surprisingly effective, but the overall experience is rather uninspiring. 5/10",Sleeping Beauty

33,tomgillespie2002,A delight from start to finish,8,21 September 2014,"If there's one thing that separates the classic Disney era from it's modern efforts, then it was their ability to truly bring a fairytale to life. The moral and narrative simplicity of the fairytale formula is now portrayed somewhat cynically, with their black-and-white ethics and la-de-da princesses receiving a lampooning in the likes of Shrek (2001) and Enchanted (2007). Although this can make for clever and amusing viewing, it makes it easy to forget how beguiling these stories can be. Sleeping Beauty is one of Disney's finest, and a perfect example of how the make-believe world of witches, fairies, kings and princesses can truly enthral and fill a young heart with wonder.King Stefan and Queen Leah welcome the birth of their daughter, Princess Aurora (Mary Costa), and invite their subjects to pay homage at their castle. The baby is thrice blessed by the three good fairies, Flora (Verna Felton), Fauna (Barbara Jo Allen) and Merryweather (Barbara Luddy), until the evil sorceress Maleficent (Eleanor Audley) gate-crashes the party. Maleficent curses the princess and announces that on her sixteenth birthday, she will prick her finger on a spinning wheel and die. The curse is dented somewhat when Merryweather intercepts, meaning that Aurora will not die, but will fall into an eternal sleep unless she receives true love's kiss.Inspired by the Brothers Grimm's Little Briar Rose and The Sleeping Beauty by Charles Perrault, the film, under the directorial supervision of Clyde Geronimi, has some of the finest animation work ever put out by Disney. The last Disney film to use hand-inked cells, animators Marc Davis, Milt Kahl, Frank Thomas, Ollie Johnston, John Lounsbery, Wolfgang Reitherman and Eric Larson, create a beautiful world reminiscent of the colourful Medievals film that were so popular in the 1950's, when Technicolor was a-booming. The climax, which sees the horned demon Maleficent turn into a dragon, was revolutionary in it's day and is still unnervingly striking today. The romance between Aurora and her betrothed - the amusingly named Prince Phillip (Bill Shirley) - is rather unconvincing and wishy-washy, but it does little damage to a movie that is a delight from start to finish.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Sleeping Beauty

Brief Review -Another Wondrous Piece in Disney's Animated Amusement Park. Long Live Princess Aurora and Long Live Sleeping Beauty. Sleeping Beauty is a sweet tale of a princess named Aurora who is cursed by Evil witch Maleficent. Only the first kiss of true love can break the curse hence Price Phillips must fight Maleficent. This was Disney's first feature film that did not have the same background animation material, but instead it had new background animation material. This amusing tale and fantastic world of Disney gets a Perfect Happy Ending to end this film on a satisfying note. One of the major factor why this film keeps you on edge of your seat is the runtime of simply 75 minutes. How Intelligible it could have got? The visuals are fantastic and musicals are pleasing as far as the potential and time space was concerned. Sleeping Beauty is blessed by simplicity that hits the right chords. Many complex films and technical spectacular attempt fails because of lacking simplicity. The connect i made with the film was truly fascinating and that too in just first 5 minutes. You see, when the film begins and you start feeling like that you are in a fantasy world and you start believing everything happening there, this feeling must occur for the film to have worked and it occurs while watch Sleeping Beauty. I heard that the film was a moderate success when released (may be because Hollywood was making Huge spectacles then, like Ben-Hur, The Ten Commandments) but gained popularity in re-releases and today this film stands as One of those Top 10 Biggest Animated Hits of all Time. Believe it or not, for adjusted inflation Sleeping Beauty is Bigger Hit than 'Avengers : Infinity War'. Disney had made several Animated classics before making this but still Sleeping Beauty doesn't disappoint at all. It's wonderful and tasty.

37,Vartiainen,"Masterfully animated, great villain",9,19 July 2015,"Sleeping Beauty is one of the more uneven Disney classics. Meaning that while some of its elements are frankly speaking revolutionary, culture-changing even, it has some other elements that are not really that good, not by Disney standards or even objectively.First the good stuff. The animation is quite frankly among the best Disney has produced. Ever. The characters move with fluid grace, the colours defy believe and help the whole movie leap from the screen and the attention to detail is amazing. But it's the backgrounds which make this one of the, if not the best movie Disney has ever released. The designs are fantastically medieval, the amount of detail they have put into every frame is unbelievable and it's no wonder it took so long to produce and cost so much that it really had no realistic hope of making its money back. But it was worth it. This is animation art in its finest form. Every single frame worthy of being framed and hanged on the wall.And then there's Maleficent, the finest Disney villain since the original Evil Queen from Snow White, and the first one to truly eclipse her. And she's still amazing. Eleanor Audley really gives her a threatening presence with her voice alone. She can be quietly menacing when she needs to be, but when she's truly enraged, she also has the lungs to back it up. Plus the character design, the storyline, they're all enough to cement her as one of the great ones.Then the bad stuff. Aurora and Prince Phillip are awful. Their character designs are great, but they have no screen time to build chemistry, their romance is one of the quickest even by Disney standards, their storyline is not interesting and as a whole they're a dreadful bore.Luckily the three fairymothers are a lot of fun. They're not on Maleficent's level, but they hold the movie together admirably.Sleeping Beauty is one of the best Disney movies. It's not the best because quite frankly I can't stand the romantic couple in it, but aside from that, it holds a dear place in my heart.",Sleeping Beauty
38,lisafordeay,The last fairytale in Walt Disney's era until the next 30 odd years,5,8 June 2014,"Sleeping Beauty is Walt Disney's 16th Disney animated fairy-tale and tells the tale of a beautiful princess named Aurora who has an evil curse on her set by Maleficent(who I think is one of the best villains of all time as she is so evil and so manipulative,compare to Angelina Jolie's version which sees a softer side to her)that on the eve of Aurora's 16th birthday she will prick her finger on a spinning wheel and be put to sleep until true love's kiss can break it. So Aurora's 3 fairies decide to turn themselves into ordinary peasant women and raise the child as their own(again we have this in nearly EVERY Disney movie from The Hunchback Of Notre Dame,to Tangled),but when Aurora meets a handsome prince called Phillip,she may be leading herself and him in danger as she goes under the guise of Briar Rose,so that Maleficent won't be able to find her,but will Maleficent find her and will Aurora be awakened by true love's kiss?So lets start with the good in this movie,the animation in this movie is very beautiful to look at and Aurora is beautiful but that's it she's just some beautiful chick but she lacks in personality as she rarely even talks in this movie and that is the bad in this film,as beautiful as the film looks it lacks with our heroine and her prince as they NEVER talk for the last 30 or 40 minutes at the end of the film all Aurora does is sleep and Prince Phillip doesn't even say the likes of 'Fear not my maiden I shall strike and kill Maleficent with my mighty sword' whatever they use in that century.So do I like this movie.............well I do but its not the BEST FILM EVER made.

This one arrives late in the studio's golden period, as the creative staff is beginning to fragment, but the holdovers still know how to tap into the same old magic. Walt Disney was personally adamant that this film be wholly distinct from 1937's Snow White - with good reason, as the two share several crucial story elements - but I don't think it got there. It's a more proficient film, smoother and lovelier, better balanced, with a far more memorable foil, but in theme and appearance, there's just no escaping those similarities. That isn't a terrible thing, though; it's not like the Brothers Grimm never revisited the same fertile ground.Creative direction is where Sleeping Beauty really distinguishes itself, anyway, with a unified art deco flourish flooding the scenery and an awesomely sinister edge to anything even remotely menacing. They really outdid themselves with the evil castle/sorcerer/stormclouds stuff this time around. Maleficent alone is a stunning figure, simple and refined, elegantly evil, instantly recognizable and believably intimidating despite her slight frame.Excellent fantasy material with a touch of the whimsical, still beautiful after all this time, and the last chapter of an important era in animation history. A fond, carefully-orchestrated farewell.",Sleeping Beauty
42,snoozejonc,A disgrace to the forces of evil,8,29 July 2021,"A princess has a curse placed upon her by an evil fairy.This is an enjoyable Disney version of classic fairytale with strong animation and some memorable sequences.The plot is quite thin as the fairytale is stretched out to last a feature length movie and contains a lot of similar structure and imagery to 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarves'. It starts and finishes strongly but I found it quite slow and a bit meandering in the middle.I enjoyed the animation. As you can imagine with Disney it is bright, beautifully coloured and full of spectacle. The design of Maleficent is excellent and all scenes involving her character are exceptionally well done. I love the curse scene, the spinning wheel sequence and the colour changes during the moments after true love's kiss.Ultimately Disney plays it safe by sticking with a proven formula. As far a Disney Princess characters go, Arora is yet another example of a female one ambition in life: find a man. As bad a role model as this might be for little girls, they will probably enjoy every minute of it as mine did.For me it is a 7.5/10 but I round upwards.",Sleeping Beauty
43,r96sk,Worth watching,7,27 May 2020,"Another solid effort from the opening decades of Disney.I found the premise to 'Sleeping Beauty' enjoyable. There are better stories out there, but this one featuring Princess Aurora and Prince Phillip is decent. Those two are noteworthy here, but Maleficent is the most interesting.The voices for Aurora and Phillip are done by Mary Costa and Bill Shirley, while Maleficent is voiced by Eleanor Audley; the latter is the standout, just like in 'Cinderella'... she's good at playing the villain! Aside from those three, there isn't much depth to the rest of the characters.The animation seems, at least to me, to be inferior in parts of this film. A lot of the terrain in the forest looks blocky, it is seemingly a different style used compared to their preceding eight productions - or maybe it's just something I noticed more here than in any other.3* for me, worth watching.",Sleeping Beauty
44,MissSimonetta,A visual masterpiece,10,4 May 2014,"Sleeping Beauty (1959) is not strong on story, I will admit. It embellishes little on top of the fairy tale and outside of the fairies and Maleficent (truly one of the greatest villains in classic film) none of the characters manage to rise above being mere ciphers. Still, this is among the greatest of Disney films for its sheer visual gorgeousness.The animation is exquisite to say the least. The backgrounds, though they have their detractors like animation historian Michael Barrier, fit the more angular, jewel-colored characters in my opinion. They look so good on their own that you would not mind framing them on a wall at home. Tchaikovsky's music from the ballet Sleeping Beauty is beautifully adapted into the musical numbers and background scoring.Not for people looking for emotional depth, but for those who aren't adverse to style over substance films, this is excellent stuff. It's an epic masterpiece.",Sleeping Beauty
45,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,Absolutely romantic Disney masterpiece,10,19 January 2006,"In my opinion, this is an absolutely romantic Disney masterpiece. If you ask me, Maleficent (voice of Eleanor Audley) was truly diabolical. You'll have to see the movie if you want to know why. On the other hand, Sleeping Beauty (voice of Mary Costa) was a very beautiful lady. To me, the scenery was beautiful, the cast was well chosen, and the writing was strong. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone involved in this film did very well. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this absolutely romantic Disney masterpiece to all of you who haven't seen it. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.",Sleeping Beauty
46,davispittman,"Now deal with me, and all the powers of HELL!!!",8,29 April 2017,"That is my favorite quote from this Disney classic. Disney really didn't shy away from being real and didn't try to stay completely G rated. And I love that about this film. Maleficent is an excellent villainous, she has the perfect evil look and the voicing is great too, fits the character well. The fairies are great lovable characters. I always forget which is which but I know they're flora fauna and maryweather, hope I didn't butcher the names lol. But anyways, the fairies that guard and look after Aurora as a child are very colorful and fun characters which makes the movie overall more fun and fitting for kids to love. Aurora is an alright Disney princess, I don't know she's just not a very good character to me personally. Now I did like Prince Philip as a character, he's a charming lovable male love interest. I would've liked the romance between Aurora and Philip better if Aurora wasn't so bland and boring as a character. Aurora really is the only part of the movie I just don't really care for. The rest is great and very entertaining. This is yet another Disney movie that I do recommend for a fun family movie night. The action is fun and engaging and I especially loved the special effects, they're the best when it comes to Maleficent. 8/10.",Sleeping Beauty
47,jfgibson73,Very mixed feelings,8,25 May 2015,"I'm rating this movie an 8 because it does many things incredibly well. Overall, however, it has some flaws I can't overlook, mainly story and character. To begin, it has one of the great villains in Maleficent, and her scenes are incredibly satisfying. The voice work from Eleanor Audrey always transports me. The three fairies are classic Disney characters, but their roles feel too prominent. Aurora, the title character, is slight, but I still end up liking her once her first major scene gets going. The backgrounds are incredible, especially in the forest. There was a lot of effort put into the art and animation, and it brings to life the feeling of listening to my grandmother reading from a collection of fair tales. The final act, especially the climactic battle with the dragon, is epic. The movie ends on just the right note, but when I reflect back on the whole of it, it feels incomplete. I have this sense that this could have been a perfect movie, but gave us a bit too little.",Sleeping Beauty

50,Spleen,Beautiful sleeper,9,27 July 1999,"I have yet to see `Sleeping Beauty' on a big, wide screen - I can only dream.  Of all animated films this one offers the most spectacle, the most astounding sights.  The downside is that production design wags the dog. This is a truly beautiful film; but it is also, I must admit, a little drowsy.  -Actually I'm simplifying a little.  Aurora and Phillip are ciphers, and they would have been ciphers whatever the art direction had been like; the story is not an enthralling story, and the art direction cannot be blamed for THAT, either.  At most the art direction stiffens and constrains Disney's animators a little.  But it gives us ample compensation. It's a strangely fertile cross-breed between square-angled medieval painting and animation styles of the 1950s.  It's an understatement to say that nothing else is quite like it.The score is adapted from Tchaikovsky's ballet (and bits of his fifth symphony, and probably bits of other things), with the suggestion being, presumably, that since Tchaikovsky claimed this territory, nothing less than Tchaikovsky will now serve.  It adds to the ornate grandeur, certainly. (Tchaikovsky is not always ideally treated, though, when lyrics are set to his tunes.)Of all the studio's animated films this one is closest in spirit to a fairytale.  It's mesmerising rather than involving.  We can forgive it much because it so clearly believes in itself.",Sleeping Beauty
51,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,A disney classic yet rather forgettable except for some key parts,5,22 May 2021,"During its early years the Walt Disney company had established itself as the studio for making animated films. There was a talent for converting classic fairytale stories from the books to film that caught everyone's attention. Despite the massive success though, even the mouse house waivered later on its years. While this film apparently opened successfully when released, it was not as financially beneficial in the long run. At the time, it was the costliest animated film to date for the studio. One of which would lead to change in direction of the company for a while thereafter. So was it the film that didn't work or just the accrued costs involved? More than likely the latter, but when looking at this film now, it's a classic yet not exactly as unique as one might think or remember.Headed by supervising director Clyde Geronimi, a slew of other sequence directors and with the story adapted by Erdman Penner who both did Peter Pan (1953), the story is about a princess named Aurora who is betrothed to wed the prince of another kingdom and bring the two lands together. The plight of this story is when the sorceress Maleficent enters the picture. After not being invited to the kingdom's ceremony, she bestows a curse on Princess Aurora that she will prick her finger on a spindle and fall into a deep sleep during her 16th birthday. From there it's up to Aurora's fairy ""god mothers"" Flora, Fauna and Merryweather to keep her from making this curse come true. The concept sounds different, honestly it really isn't by a lot. Not to mention it has been recorded that Disney didn't want audiences drawing parallels to that of their first film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937).With that said, it seems like they already knew this might be a gamble and it sort of shows. Some people remember this film fondly for being a part of the classic Disney princess lineup. However, it seems this film is remembered more for the opposite reason. The cast of actors playing the main roles feels what only can be described as the last of the golden age of Hollywood voices. Actors like Bill Thompson, Barbara Jo Allen, Barbara Luddy, Verna Felton and Mary Costa all participated in other movies that most would consider long before their time to know. The voice acting itself is fine for the roles the cast play, but what people tend to recall the most about this feature was Maleficent (Eleanor Audley). Not sure if it's the stark gothic design of the character against the rest of the background but the character has only grown in popularity since.However, the antagonist is not enough to carry this picture. The main characters themselves feel very hollow. While the character designs are friendly looking, they don't add much to the story when it comes to development. Princess Aurora who is more a plot device than an actual character is pretty yes, but she says very little of importance and the same could be said for her betrothed partner Prince Phillip. The real main focus goes to the three fairies who work to keep Aurora secretly hidden from Maleficent. That's fine, but the title of this film isn't the three fairies, it's sleeping beauty! It also really doesn't help that this film shares similar plot elements to that of Snow White. A female antagonist places a curse on a young more beautiful princess that puts them in a deep sleep. And love's first kiss is what's needed to break the curse? I can't imagine why the story felt familiar.Yet with a run time not even at an hour and a half, the pacing feels slower than usual too. Perhaps it's because there are very few characters who leave a lasting impression. The animation though cannot be discredited. Several other Disney films before it were not featured in widescreen format, but this one is and it definitely adds scope to the fairytale. Not only is the animation fluid, but well drawn with lots of detail. Imagine the effort it took to animate every cell of this feature, what a painstaking process. Lastly the music composed by Disney familiar George Bruns did a decent job. While there aren't very many songs that will stick in the viewer's head like other Disney classics, the sound is still very much reflective of the scenes that play out in the movie.It may be considered a part of the Disney classics, but it's not as entertaining as one might think. The villain is surely the most memorable component along with its animation coming in second. But it's the under developed main characters, pacing and similar plot elements that make this fairytale a snoozer.",Sleeping Beauty
52,Kamurai25,"A famed classic, but maybe only for a lack of options",6,2 July 2020,"Good watch, not sure if I'd want to watch this version again, but can recommend that everyone see this at least once.Disney has a particular flair for making their movies light and airy, especially with princesses chatting with wildlife, but the key of that is that they know how to develop an atmosphere to make you feel a certain way about the scene. That extends to making a scene look or feel dark, gritty, and dangerous, and this movie really flips from one to the other.Past the visual delight of the movie, the story did feel a bit weak: they were working from an old fairy tale they wouldn't have to pay for. For that, there is an incredible amount of detail surrounding Maleficent's home, and Aurora's wood, but there is just so little said in the movie.There is almost a story that is interesting, then they just magic the thing to happen anyways.Sometimes it great to get in the way back machine, but I'm not sure that this movie holds a lot of value past historical.

Angered by the perceived disrespect for not having been invited, Maleficent interrupts the blessings of the three fairies Flora, Fauna, and Merriweather and condemns princess Aurora will prick her finger upon the spindle of spinning wheel on her 16th birthday and die. With Merriweather's gift she can't end the curse, but changes it so that it becomes a death like sleep that can be ended by true love's kiss. With the consent of the King and Queen, the fairies take Aurora to the woods to raise her under the guise of three peasant women until her 16th birthday. 16 years later Aurora (now called Briar Rose) has a chance encounter with Prince Phillip and the two fall for each other not knowing they've been betrothed. Meanwhile Maleficent takes measures to ensure her curse reaches its terrible goal.Released in 1959, Sleeping Beauty is an adaptation of Little Briar Rose by The Brothers Grimm which was itself adapted from earlier versions by Giambattista Basile and Charles Perrault. Development of Sleeping Beauty can be traced to 1950 in which Cinderella became the biggest success for the studio since Snow White and most likely served as the impetus for adapting another fairy tale. Originally intended for release in 1955, the film was beset by behind the scenes production turmoil and various other stumbling blocks that resulted in Sleeping Beauty going massively overbudget and failing to recoup its production budget (at least on initial release). In the years since it's release Sleeping Beauty has become sort of the archetypical with most jokes, parodies, and homages typically evoking the iconography in this film more than say Cinderella or Snow White, with that said it's not because Sleeping Beauty is better than those two films, it's more that Sleeping Beauty just happened to become the default that popular consciousness goes to for animated fairy tale renditions.Plotwise the movie follows a similar structure to Cinderella and Snow White but unlike the two princess movies that preceded it, Aurora/Briar Rose isn't all that phased by her situation of a callous villain who harbors her ill intent. For most of the movie Aurora is blissfully unaware of Maleficient's ill will towards her. In some ways Aurora is less defined than even Snow White from 1937 but even Snow White we spent more time with and had more character moments (even if they were variations most of the same character points). While Aurora is a bit of a step backwards from Cinderella, I will say Prince Phillip is the most defined we've seen from the Disney animated cannon (even if that's not a high standard) and feels more like a character here with even a few humorous moments thrown in. But unfortunately around the half way point what character he had is basically gone as he doesn't say another word throughout the movie. The movie seems like it's almost bored of its leads and instead focuses a lot of time on its side characters like the three fairies, the kings, and of course Maleficient who is the best reason to see this film. While motivated by a shallow motivation that amounts to ""someone had a party and didn't invite me"", the character's design, intensity, and ability coupled with Eleanor Audley's harsh vocal delivery she used as Lady Tremaine in Cinderella now made even more chilling with a character whose powers are as chilling as the voice.The animation is well done. The movie has a unique look seemingly modeled after Medieval tapestries with slightly flatter designs for it characters and animation that work mostly to its advantage in capturing the look. Complementing the tapestry inspired art is the harsh gothic look of Maleficent and her castle with a foreboding usage of delightfully macabre imagery. The movements of characters are pitch perfect with a thrilling climax culminating in a beautifully animated dragon battle that features so many eye catching details it's a feast for the yes.Sleeping Beaty doesn't add all that much to the Disney Princess film, but it is a visually audacious and striking film to see. While the two leads are mostly blank slates, the movie compensates by giving a strong supporting cast filled with memorable personalities as well as a memorably despicable ""boo hiss"" villain you love to hate. Not on the same level as Snow White and Cinderella, but enjoyable for what it is.",Sleeping Beauty

58,Beta_Gallinger,"I was expecting a bit more, but still got a decent Disney princess movie",7,7 December 2010,"The first animated Disney feature was 1937's ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"", so it started with a princess movie, and more than one of those followed. When I finally watched ""Enchanted"" about three months ago, I did not like it at all, and could not imagine a second viewing changing my opinion, but since that film is based on the Disney princess movies, I was reminded that even though I had revisited ""Snow White"" three years earlier, I didn't have much memory of the Disney versions of ""Cinderella"" and ""Sleeping Beauty"". After that, it wasn't long before I gave the 1950 release a watch, and I didn't recognize much of it, but still thought it was pretty good. That also turned out to be the case when I watched this 1959 feature.King Stefan and Queen Leah give birth to a daughter, and she is named Aurora. At her christening ceremony, the three good fairies, Fauna, Flora, and Merryweather, come to bless her with one gift each. From Flora, Princess Aurora gets the gift of beauty, and Fauna gives the newborn princess the gift of song, but then the evil Maleficent appears and curses the infant so she will prick her finger on a spinning wheel's spindle and die before sunset on her sixteenth birthday! After the evil fairy leaves, Merryweather still has her blessing to give, and she cannot stop the curse, but she can weaken it. She changes it so when Aurora pricks her finger, she will not die, but will instead fall asleep until she is awakened by true love's kiss. After the ceremony, the three good fairies decide to hide the princess by taking her away from the castle and living as peasants for the next sixteen years, raising her in a woodland cottage. When Aurora, now called Briar Rose, turns sixteen, Maleficent's minions can't seem to find her, but the evil fairy is determined to have her found and have the sinister prophecy fulfilled! Fauna, Flora, and Merryweather make their first appearance in the film near the beginning, and there was something about these characters that made them seem a bit bland to me. Maybe they're supposed to be funnier than I found them to be. The part showing sixteen year old Aurora walking through the forest with her animal friends and singing as Prince Phillip comes nearer gets a little tiring, and so do the scenes showing the fairies trying to make a gown and cake for the princess, though the fight over whether to make the gown pink or blue is funny. Not everything about this version of ""Sleeping Beauty"" is that good, but there's still enough to like. The backgrounds are beautiful, especially in the forest, and there are some good moments of comic relief, the first one probably being the first scene showing Maleficent in her castle with her minions, learning that they've been looking for a baby all along. Also, Prince Phillip's father, King Hubert, can be a good character for laughs. There aren't as many laughs here as there are in many other Disney efforts, but there certainly are some. Even with the positive elements I've mentioned, the movie would still be pretty dull for the most part without a good plot which gets exciting, but fortunately, it has that as well.Watching this after Disney's ""Cinderella"", I was expecting it to be better that that film, especially since it isn't the one with the high-pitched talking mice, but after watching them both from start to finish, I would say they're basically equal in quality. Neither is as good as the Disney version of ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"", which preceded both of them, but they are decent princess movies for the family nonetheless. So, while I don't think this ""Sleeping Beauty"" is the masterpiece many Disney fans might think it is, it's still another entertaining fairy tale adaptation from the early decades of the Disney animated features. I'm quite sure I only ever saw a little bit of this is a kid, which would have been in the 1990s, but I'm sure many viewers through the generations have enjoyed it both as kids and as adults, so as usual with these popular animated movies, this one is not restricted to any specific age group.",Sleeping Beauty

But the greatness of the good stuff is so overwhelming and magical that you would be an asshole not to judge its greatness. Along with Bambi, Sleeping Beauty has the most gorgeous forest landscapes and a colour palette which demonstrates how much colour adds to the mood and impression of differen places, from the green and black of Maleficent's lair and her minions to the pastel colours of Aurora's castle. Speaking of Maleficent, she is bloody brilliant in almost every way. Of the fantasy based Disney villains she and The Horned King are my favourites. The Horned King's design surely is based on her's ;) About the characters: that's one of the movie's most polarising aspect, because the fairy godmothers are great and have the best lines in the movie along with Maleficent. The prince and Aurora are so boring! Our main characters barely say anything through out the movie, Aurora is put to sleep so she is forgiven, but the prince doesn't even utter a single line after saying ""goodbye father"" and goes out to fight Maleficent. Yeah, that's a major drawback, but everything else is so amazing that it outweighs the obvious flaws.

62,mitsubishizero,Nice for what it is,7,4 July 2019,The animation's amazing and the characters are fun to watch while the main character doesn't have much of a personality. In fact she's barely in the movie at all. After getting cursed by Maleficent during her christening the three fairies take her in to protect her. She grows into a beautiful woman who meets a prince. What makes this interesting is that the prince has more of a character and bigger role than the previous movies. The king has more even more character and screen time than his son. The main antagonist Maleficent is probably the highlight. Her vile nature solidified her as one of the best villains of all time. As a classic it's ok.

Today is the 60th anniversary of the Disney film.The story about aurora a beautiful princess who gets cursed by an evil witch named Maleficent. She predicts that on her sixteenth birthday she'll prick her finger on a spinning wheel and fall into a sleeping death. So the three good fairies Fauna Flora and Merryweather take her to a cottage to keep her safe. But once Aurora learns about her true heritage after meeting a handsome man named Prince Phillip she gets hypnotized by Maleficent Into pricking her own finger fulfilling the curse. Prince Phillip gets captured by Maleficent but the help of the three good fairies he conquers her and kisses Aurora and breaks the curse.The film had mixed reviews when it first premiered and was a failure at the box office but a few decades later it has gotten more acclaim and is considered to be one of the best Disney films of all time. And does it hold up? Absolutely. Sure Princess Aurora and Prince Phillip are still really bland characters despite the solid voice work, singing, and the final battle revolving around Phillip (we'll get to that in a moment), but everything else is great.The story is well executed with lots of charm heart and atmosphere, the music including the song Once Upon A Dream and the final battle music where Phillip fights against Maleficent in dragon form is both epic and memorable, the side characters are entertaining particularly the three good fairies and the two kings, the animation style that resembles a tapestry is still gorgeous to this day, and Maleficent is still one of the best animated Disney Villains of all time. The idea of having a female evil satan is great and the late Eleanor Audley gave a solid voice performance with the best line deliveries ever.And last but not least the final battle between Phillip and Maleficent. It's epic it's intense it's unforgettable and with George Bruns dark and beautiful music score which fitted the terrifying moments really well including the part where Aurora gets hypnotized by Maleficent.Overall, Sleeping Beauty still remains as one of the best Disney films ever made.

This artwork is stylish and obeys to high quality standards, not to mention that the sceneries and backgrounds are good in general.This is one of the Disney classics which took more time to be made and perhaps one of their most ambitious. In fact, maybe because of its medieval artwork, it spent about 6 or 7 years in production. This spent nearly the whole 1950 decade in production. A very long time, even for an animated film. Only ""The Black Cauldron"" took as much time as this to be made, but we can't compare ""The Black Cauldron"" to the undeniably superior ""Sleeping Beauty"".There is a curious fact that surrounds the movie's final scene (when Prince Phillip and Princess Aurora dance above the clouds): that ""trick"" was actually tried in ""Cinderella"", but they only managed to do it successfully in ""Sleeping Beauty"".As a movie, generally speaking it is pretty good, happy, pleasant, magic, romantic, sometimes dramatic and emotional, while classic humor is not forgotten either (there are many funny moments, actually). On the other hand, this movie is also extremely dark in some parts, although it doesn't go as far as ""The Black Cauldron"" does when it comes to extreme darkness. Even if ""Sleeping Beauty"" has its dark side, it isn't much darker than what we see in many other Disney animated films.Maleficent is the kind of villain I can't find a correct word to describe: an evil queen? A queen of darkness? An evil fairy? A witch? A sorceress? Whatever she is, she looks sinister, yet she isn't that scary considering her appearance. She's nowhere near as scary and chilly as the Horned King from ""The Black Cauldron"". Eleanor Audley, with that powerful voice, does a spectacular job as Maleficent's voice.Aurora (aka ""Briar Rose"") is a gorgeous princess with an even more beautiful voice. She's also a wonderful singer. Mary Costa does beautifully her voice.Prince Phillip is one of the coolest and most charming Disney princes of all time. And one of the funniest too. His horse Samson is one of the coolest and funniest horses of all time. Prince Phillip is brilliantly voiced by Bill Shirley.The queen (Aurora's mother) appears very little during the whole movie (we only see her at the beginning and at the end). King Stephan is a great dude and King Hubert is quite a funny guy. An especially funny scene with them is when they are discussing about Phillip and Aurora and Hubert starts fighting with a fish as if it was a sword and they end up laughing of that. Both characters are greatly voiced by the respective actors.As for the 3 good fairies (Fauna, Flora and Merryweather), I'd say that my favorite is Merryweather. She is the funniest of the three. Also, I like the blue dress better than the pink one (although both colors fit well on the dress). But the blue is always prettier than the pink.The animals which Aurora meets in the forest are other charming characters. The funniest one is the owl. Speaking of animals, Maleficent's pet raven is an interesting character yet a bit annoying - what a snitch that thing is!As for the soundtrack, it is entirely beautiful but the best is in ""Once Upon a Dream"" and the famous classical music ""Sleeping Beauty ballet"" by Tchaikovsky.Just to finalize my review, this movie was very unsuccessful when it originally came out in 1959, almost bankrupting the Disney studio. But it won loyal fans through the years and reached a cult status. I guess you can say that time has been kind to it.",Sleeping Beauty
66,katyayan-12892,A Sleeping Beauty,6,25 October 2021,"Review By Kamal KThere are many awesome concepts in this film that it is a shame that the story didn't seem to work well. The art style is based on medieval tapestry drawings and looks amazing.Unfortunately, no one went to see the film and it lost money at the box office and set princess films back until The Little Mermaid in 1989. The story is a little off, as the main protagonists of the story seem to be the three good fairies and not Aurora (Sleeping Beauty) herself. The prince does get more to say and do than his predecessors and the villain really steals the show. Maleficent is the best Disney villain, she knows she is evil and loves every minute of it, while being completely regal in action. While she can also lose her cool at the drop of a dime. A movie worth your time.",Sleeping Beauty
67,FloatingOpera7,Disney's Animated Epic Classic: Sleeping Beauty,10,7 March 2009,"Sleeping Beauty (1959): Verna Felton, Barbara Jo Allen, Barbara Luddy, Eleanor Audley, Mary Costa, Bill Shirley, Taylor Holmes, Bill Thompson, Candy Candido, Bill Amsbery, Pinto Colvig, Dal MacKennon, Marvin Miller, Thurl Ravenscroft...Director...Clyde Geronimi..Screenplay/Writing...Erdaman Penner, Joe Rinaldi, Winston Hibler, Bill Peet, Ted Sears, Ralph Wright, Milt Banta...Based on the Charles Perrault fairy tale and the ballet by Peter Ilych Tchaikovsky with music arranged by George Bruns.The Masterpiece: When released in 1959, Walt Disney's Sleeping Beauty heralded a new era in it's company's animated films that would continue into the 1960's. It was a film that cost Disney 6 million dollars and his most cherished creation that took the entire decade of the 1950's to complete. The result was a beloved and world renowned fairy tale come to epic life on the big screen in Technorama, with amazing sound, color and beautiful music and melodies/themes lifted from Tchaikovsky's ballet score. It was for the folks at Disney their masterpiece not unlike epic movies that had been impressing audiences by the late 50's to compete with home television - The Ten Commandments, Ben Hur, etc. But the crown is definitely the animation and bold new cinematic look. This brilliant new look was breathtaking for 1959 audiences who had never seen anything like it. It was a kind of animated epic drama or opera. It owed to principal animator Eyvin Earle's stylistic and artsy technique, plus the contributions of great animators like Don Bluth (who would later in the 80's create films like The Land Before Time, etc) and even Chuck Jones who did work for Looney Tunes. Despite following the ""fairy tale book"" genre that Disney had done with ""Snow White"" and ""Cinderella"", the fairy tale presented in the film is not based on the simplistic original. It is an original Disney re-make of the old and distinctly European tale. Rather than seeing it as a fairy tale, one must see it as being fantasy fiction. Its look borrows from 1400's pre-Renaissance/Gothic Medieval paintings, ""Joan of Arc"" times, Christian and Catholic Europe, coat of arms, embroidery, drapes, banners and architecture. The castles are very European and in fact resemble castles depicted in illustrated manuscripts and even King Ludwig's Neuschwanstein castle in Bavaria, Germany, for which Disney modeled the Disneyland castle in California. Everything is bigger than what it was originally in the tale and it ultimately deals with good versus evil and the protection of an innocent princess by the forces of good from an evil prophecy. The epic battle between Prince Phillip and Maleficent as a Dragon suddenly becomes a sword-and-sorcery fantasy complete with a hero and heroine.Plot: King Stefan and his Queen have their long awaited child/heir Princess Aurora and the whole kingdom celebrates by a lavish and ritualistic, almost Catholic Christening. The Three Good Fairies (in primary colors red, green and blue) Flora (Verna Felton), Fauna (Barbara Jo Allen) and the feisty Merriwether (Barbara Luddy) bestow Aurora with blessings and gifts of beauty, grace and song. But the country's outcast fairy, who is in fact an evil sorceress Maleficent, bitter at not being invited and more so for not being ""wanted"" takes revenge by cursing Aurora with an evil prophecy: On her 16th birthday she will prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and die. Merriwether's gift: the reverse spell of putting her to sleep until her true love kisses her. The 3 Fairies take no chances and decide to raise the girl as their own ward in a secluded cottage in the deep woods. Aurora grows into a beautiful young maiden with a beautiful singing voice (Mary Costa vocalizes). Before she knows it, she's met Prince Phillip, out for a ride in the woods, and does not know that he was her betrothed all along. Neither of them are aware of their previous roles as future Prince and Princess. Upon Aurora's return to the castle where she was born, Maleficent uses her dark magic to hypnotize the princess and have her prick her finger on a dark spinning wheel made by witchcraft. The 3 Faries put the entire kingdom to sleep. Maleficent kidnaps Prince Phillip, complicating things until the Fairies rescue him. It's now a direct conflict between Maleficent and the Prince, between good and evil, for the fate of Princess Aurora.The films of Walt Disney, beginning with Snow White, including Fantasia, and the films made in the 50's- Peter Pan, Alice In Wonderland, and Lady And The Tramp, seemed to climax with the ""new"" style of Sleeping Beauty. It was the pinnacle of Disney's animated movies at the time and a fitting fireworks finale to a decade of great movies.",Sleeping Beauty
68,Mightyzebra,Such a wonderful Disney classic.,9,6 February 2008,"Not insulting Disney, this just does not seem like a Disney film. There are many scary scenes (which are likely to disturb anyone aged under 9 or so) and there are many scenes that will make much more sense to adults than to children. There are also many references to what life was like in the Medieval ages (not counting the fantasy scenes of course), including the fact that it was quite normal (or even a little late) for girls to marry when they are 16. In none of Disney's other films is there this kind of reference.Aside of these points, there is stunning Disney charm, animation, humour for just about everyone and this film also includes pieces from Tchaicovsky's ballet. The characters and plot of course also help make up this wonderful animated film. The only negative point is the fact that it strays quite far from the original fairy tale, but in some cases this is not really a bad thing.You may know the story already. A baby girl is born to a king and queen and three good fairies bless the child with a gift. Although - at first it is only two. Just as the third fairy is about to bless her gift, the bad fairy Malecifent gives the baby a bad gift, that she will die on her 16th birthday. The good fairy helps turn this around, but only in a little way...Recommended to anyone who likes the fairytale, the ballet or the princess stuff of ""Sleeping Beauty"". Enjoy! :-)",Sleeping Beauty
69,ersinkdotcom,Excellent Animation and Gothic Overtones,8,8 October 2014,"The evil sorceress Maleficent places a curse on Princess Aurora after being slighted by the royal family. She will die by pricking her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel before her 16th birthday. The king puts his daughter in the care of three fairies who take her into hiding to keep the tragedy from occurring. Maleficent becomes obsessed with finding the girl and fulfilling her evil spell.I was pleasantly reminded of the dark elegance of Maleficent and the strong Gothic overtones presented in ""Sleeping Beauty."" They reminded me of the atmosphere found in the underrated ""The Black Cauldron"" and ""Hunchback of Notre Dame.""

(Note: even though everyone knows this story, I classified this as a ""spoiler"" type review just to be safe.)What I like about this movie: I can't remember if I had seen this in whole; this played on ABC at around the same time the DVD came out here in the States. I've only seen the end part of it; that had the most important part (the kiss) and I thought it was good!!!!!Remember, this movie is on DVD (look very, very hard for it), and notice that this movie is nothing like it was a long time ago, because a whole lot of elbow grease was put into restoring the movie from start to finish, making it seem even better!!!!!""Sleeping Beauty"" - the movie guaranteed ""not"" to fall asleep to!!!!!10/10",Sleeping Beauty

One of the most beautiful blu-rays to show off. Looks like a modern film. You can tell Disney spent a fortune on the restoration. The colors of the animation and details in the artwork is stunning. I'd kill to buy a Classic Look (I decided that's a better title) Cinderella. And it would set really good precedent for Disney's continued monetization of Star Wars.How much you wanna bet when if Disney ever does release a 4K de-specialized Original Trilogy without all the CGI updates, it'll be one where they scrub off all the film grain and thus make the elusive perfect edition still a fantasy? now on upgrade Upscaled 4K and Dolby Vision coming soon on Disney 4k ultra hd release September 2021",Sleeping Beauty

73,meydiana-65242,A Disney Classic is Epic,10,8 November 2020,"When I was a little girl, Sleeping Beauty was my all time favorite Disney film. I was so in love with this story, it's crazy how many times I wore out the VHS. But growing up, I lost touch with the story, but I recently bought the DVD and re-watched the film and you know what? I'm still in love with this movie. I really miss these old Disney movies where the animation was so bright and beautiful, the characters were so lovable, and the story was so magical. I'm not bashing Disney films from today, just I'm sure we could all relate on this subject where the older Disney films just had a certain charm about it. Sleeping Beauty is just a timeless story and has so much wonderful romance, I guess since I'm a girl, I just couldn't help but still be in love with this beautiful story.Princess Aurora is born and is the future queen of her land, three fairy's, Flora, Merryweather, and Fauna bless her with three gifts: beauty and song, right as Merryweather is about to bless Aurora, the evil witch, Maleficent, comes in and curses Aurora that she shall touch a spinning wheel by her 16th birthday and die! Merryweather changes it to where she won't die, but sleep and could only be woke up by the kiss of true love. The fairy's wish to keep this from happening still, so they take Aurora and raise her as their own. One day Aurora on her 16th birthday goes out in the forest and meets the charming and handsome Prince Phillipe, but she doesn't know he's a prince and she doesn't know he's fhe man she's actually betrothed too. She is told by the fairy's that she can never see him again and that she's a princess; later that night the curse happens! Now the fairy's need Phillipe to save Aurora before it's too late.Everything about Sleeping Beauty is just a perfect Disney film and I can't wait until to show this to my future kids one day. I know that their generation is going to have just the CGI animation, so it's good that at least we still have these films, they're treasures. The voices, the animation, the story, Sleeping Beauty is the most romantic fairy tale that anyone could easily fall in love with. If you are a Disney fan, this is a must see, it's a great family film or if you're just a film buff in general, I'm a grown up and I still tear up when I watch Sleeping Beauty.10/10",Sleeping Beauty
74,EmperorNortonII,An Inspired Classic,8,24 June 2004,"""Sleeping Beauty"" is definitely a classic among the Disney animated features.  It bears the distinction of being the first to be shot in 70mm widescreen format.  The score borrows much from Tchaikovsky's classic ballet based on the Brothers Grimm tale.  The art is beautiful, being inspired by medieval art.  And the characters are delightful, particularly the three Good Fairies, Flora, Fauna and Merryweather.  Malificient makes for a wonderful villainess, with awesome magical powers.  Even those who would not call this Disney's best animated feature should agree that it harkens back to the famed studio's golden age.  It's a classic that all ages can treasure!",Sleeping Beauty

It wasn't until later I read the fairy tale and learned about the prince and the sleeping princess. But this one had an interesting villain, er, villainess, and that final battle sequence still gives me the chills. One of my teachers said that scene was really scary but I guess I wouldn't know because I wasn't born when it first came out. Still, the movie has heart, action, suspense, and romance, and it's all cohesively brought together. The fairies were among the best parts, acting as both sidekicks and mother figures. And the two separate kings (the respective fathers of the respective prince and the princess) were both funny and serious simultaneously in their exchanges. Another good part was the classical music by Tchaikovsky, with the Disney lyrics seamlessly interwoven into the original music piece.

The villain, thrillingly dark, is one who could have put her stamp on the story had she been given more scenes. The prince and princess are ciphers, but the scene in which they meet in the forest is beautifully done and tinged with an Old World mystique that more recent Disney titles have sadly lacked. The art in ""Sleeping Beauty"" is of high quality, reminiscent of ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" (1937), which employs similar settings.

86,robert-710-767167,Dinsey classics are always great!,7,9 April 2011,"The first ""princess"" classic I've seen. Definitely has the classic drama of some evil witch or person (female, really?) who tries to ruin the classic story. Almost does so, then someone, typically insignificant people, come over and save the day, and then the princess is happy.This is just that case. Someone who is a princess and someone who is a prince. They both were planned on getting married, one gets a curse. Then they hide. The evil person does what they can to stop them from succeeding. Then something good happens. That's the story of sleeping beauty.I rate this a 7/10 only for a few reasons. First, the story confused me a bit, I never did understand what she was cursed with, why the witch was evil at all, etc. Second, I thought it was rather interesting how the fairies said that the prince cannot be helped by magic, yet that's the thing they did to help the prince. I thought it was intentional, and the fairies would learn not to break their promises, but I guess it didn't get noticed.Anyhow, it's rated 7/10, but it is STILL a good classic. :)",Sleeping Beauty
87,Christopher_Reid,"Great visuals and music, a stylistic peak for Disney",10,6 January 2021,"Like Princess Aurora herself, Sleeping Beauty's gifts are its incredible visual and musical beauty, along with a foreboding curse of darkness.The early Disney films look amazing. And Sleeping Beauty is a peak of sorts, at least in terms of style. It may not have quite as much movement or been as groundbreaking as Snow White or Pinocchio, but it has such a clean, pristine look along with detailed backgrounds and just generally gorgeous animation.The budget was more than double the other Disney films of the 50s. And even though it was generally a success, especially in the long run on VHS and other formats, Sleeping Beauty was initially a big loss for the studio. Partially because of this, Disney turned to a cheaper method called xerography for 101 Dalmatians in 1961 and it shows. Their movies of the 60s and 70s look noticeably worse - much scratchier and with seemingly unfinished, messy backgrounds. In contrast, Sleeping Beauty holds up extremely well.The music is of course based on Tchaikovsky's ballet. I'm not how much it was edited or rewritten, but it works really well. Every moment is musically interesting and memorable, which is rare - I know it off by heart. ""Once Upon a Dream"" is one of my favourite Disney songs and there are many great ones.The story is not particularly rich and it does have its plot holes. For instance, why does Aurora need to be whisked away for 16 whole years? Couldn't they have hidden her just a week or two before her birthday? And couldn't they have delayed her 16th birthday? Just pretend her birthday is a week later - the truth can be explained afterwards. Or lock her in a room just for that day. It seems to be overkill to destroy every spinning wheel in the kingdom, especially since Maleficent can apparently produce one out of thin air. Since Merryweather had partially countered the spell, why not just accept that she'll prick her finger and make sure she finds true love before then? As it is, their 16th birthday celebrations get out of hand and attract Maleficent's attention.It's also not clear what Maleficent's deal is. Couldn't she just attack at any time? Why is she evil? Can't the fairies also just use powers whenever they need to? What exactly are the rules? But these kinds of flaws are common in fantasy and especially fairy tales. You have to suspend disbelief and focus on the journey, the symbolism and the morals.I think people are too harsh saying that Aurora is boring. She might not be complex, but like Cinderella and Snow White she is pure and good. She doesn't get much screentime so she's not even really the focus of the story. Like most Disney classics, the original story is padded with physical comedy - Cinderella with mice, birds and a cat, Sleeping Beauty with the 3 fairies, a drunk jester and drunk kings and a horse.There's also an exciting action climax which really is epic, especially on a big screen. It's such a mythic concept - a lone knight cutting through a thorned forest to then face off against a dragon.Sleeping Beauty is not a deep or substantial film in terms of story, dialogue or philosophy. But it is beautiful and very funny. The way Aurora dances is awesome - every frame of the movie holds up and could be a painting hung on a wall. It all flows together so smoothly as well. They didn't just use computers back then and Disney magic wasn't yet a cliche. They had real actors performing the movements as a reference and the time they spent shows. Robin Hood in 1973 recycles animation from Snow White and The Jungle Book. Disney had ups and downs in terms of creativity and integrity.I have many favourite parts of this movie. The moment when Aurora realises she's not alone is priceless. The fairies competing to change her dress colour never fails to make me laugh - apparently it came about because of actual disagreements behind the scenes as to what her dress colour should be. Maleficent going mad at her bumbling henchmen/monsters having checked all the cradles for 16 years is also hilarious. ""Idiots! Imbeciles!One more example: the king insists that Phillip must marry Aurora, but he wants to marry a girl he just met. The king is stressed and angry but later suddenly finds out that Phillip now wants to marry Aurora. He's completely baffled. There's no possible way this can make sense. But then he just lets it go. Whatever, he doesn't need to understand, as long as everything is resolved. It's easy to gloss over, but I find that whole concept hilarious.",Sleeping Beauty

90,Vimacone,Transition in Styles,7,15 February 2015,"Sleeping Beauty is a transitional film between the delicate, soft look from the 30s, 40s, and 50s and the sketchy, stylized films that were prominent in the 60s and 70s. The film has a stylized look, yet the characters yet the characters still have the soft lines. Sleeping Beauty is also a mess in some ways. The story is disjointed and unfocused at times. It's basically a rehash of Cinderella and Snow White. In fact some unused concepts from Snow White were used in this film. There are some great characters here though. The 3 fairies are fun and amusing. Bill Thomson does a great voice performance as King Hubert. Aurora is probably one of the most beautiful of the Disney heroines, yet despite being the title character, she doesn't have much screen time, even before she's put to sleep. The fairies that take care of her have the most screen time. Malifacent is one of the most interesting Disney villains. Eleanor Audley, who previously voiced Lady Tremaine in Cinderella, does a great performance. Another problem with the story is that there are too many dues ex machinas (the 3 fairies) which severely rob the story of its build up and climax. This can be summed up by the fact that when this was in production, Walt was busy working on Disneyland. Production went on for so long that it came to a point where Walt said, just finish the picture. This would also be the last fairy tale that the studio would do until The Little Mermaid thirty years later.",Sleeping Beauty

Aurora and her prince (he probably has a name) are little more than pretty-looking puppets, and Malificent's awesome design cannot hide her shallow personality. Besides, far too little time is spent rescuing princesses compared to singing in forests and bickering about dresses.More's the pity, because ""Sleeping Beauty"" really is a beautifully crafted film. The quasi-Medieval backgrounds with their expertly chosen colours are gorgeous, as is Tchaikovsky's famous ballet score. But it's hard to care when the story is as involving as a cucumber sandwich.",Sleeping Beauty
93,C22Man,A Disney masterpiece,7,10 January 2016,"Walt Disney wanted Sleeping Beauty to look completely different to the rest of Disney's animated features and be the pinnacle of animation at the time. In a number areas that was certainly achieved. Though not a success on its release, Sleeping Beauty is a visual wonder and has some of the best elements ever put in a Disney film. The film based itself around both the Charles Perrault and Brothers Grimm versions, as well as using points from the Tchaikovsky ballet. It revolves around a princess cursed to fall into a sleep on her 16th birthday by pricking her finger on a spinning wheel, from which she can only be awaken by her true love. It's a story that is widely known, but what makes the film so effective are the methods used to tell it.There's only one major issue with the film and sadly it's with the main characters. Both Aurora and Prince Phillip are incredibly dull. Aurora does practically nothing of note, all she does is stand around looking pretty or sing with the animals and she just comes off as plain boring. In her defence she is asleep for the second half of the film, but it's difficult to care for her as we know nothing about her because we never get an insight into her character. Prince Phillip is equally as uninteresting. He gets a few funny moments at first, but his attraction to Aurora is rushed and he doesn't really have a personality. He is the focal point of the climax, but he doesn't say a word during it which is odd and gets rather tedious.Elsewhere however the characters are fantastic. The three fairies are wonderful and are effectively the true heroes of the film. They all have distinct personalities without being clichéd, they provide a good balance of appropriate comedy as well drama and the voice actresses (including regulars Verna Felton and Barbara Luddy) do excellent jobs. The two kings who flip-flop between bickering and friendliness get a few good laughs too. With that said, what really pushes the film to great heights is Maleficent who is easily one of Disney's greatest ever villains. It is frighteningly evil the sheer lengths she'll go to over being snubbed at a party, showing that she is simply a superb mix of terrifying and cunning. Her design is a perfect blend of scary and stylish, while Eleanor Audley's classy voice adding even more punch to the character.The animation is simply stunning, completely different to anything Disney had done before or done since. It reminds me a lot of tapestry work or medieval art. It isn't as bright as previous films and everything is drawn in a more realistic style that gives the film an added uniqueness. The overly angular design and muted colour scheme work brilliantly in this respect too. The backgrounds are very flat and allow for the characters to pop out more, but the amount of detail that goes into them is incredible. The forests and castles are just beautiful to look at. The score is equally as good, coming straight from the famed ballet. It allows for some wonderful melodies and some great builds of tension, with songs such as 'Once Upon A Dream' also being very enjoyable.Another impressive aspect is the films atmosphere. There is a great deal of tension present throughout the film and an ever building sense of dread that makes everything at stake seem all the more important. I also enjoy how unsettling the film can be, the whole sequence involving the spinning wheel is extremely creepy thanks to the visuals and the haunting music which are both used expertly. The film also has a lot of slower moments that work in its favour in allowing the atmosphere to build up. There's also a lot more action and intensity than you would expect, in fact the climax is one of Disney's best. It keeps on building in obstacles that Prince Philip must face and Maleficent becoming a dragon takes it all to another level.On the whole I'd say Sleeping Beauty is one of Disney's strongest works from their golden age. It does have its faults mainly in its two leads who are very dull, but what it does well it does incredibly well. As said this is possibly Disney's best looking film, certainly one of their most unique, and it's a film worth viewing for the visuals alone. I think the fairies are very enjoyable, there is a wonderfully sense of atmosphere throughout and the music is fantastic. Maleficent is one of Disney's greatest villains, whenever she appears you can't take your eyes away and she has everything you would want in a villain. It's a film that rewards repeated viewings and one that is always engaging whenever I watch it.",Sleeping Beauty
94,jordyntsmith,Slow and Beautiful,6,16 August 2020,"While there isn't too much plot to go on or follow, the most stand out features of this film are the beautiful and drawn backgrounds and the presence of Maleficent herself. Some have said this was Disney's most beautiful movie, and frankly, if you know how to appreciate traditional art, you will probably say the same!",Sleeping Beauty
95,movibuf1962,I have a theory about this movie...,8,5 September 2003,"...which is that it may have been designed more for an adult audience than a children's. At any rate it was way ahead of its time in 1959. ""Sleeping Beauty"" was one of the movies I watched as a child, and its grandness overwhelmed me even at the age of ten. I couldn't be happier to see it finally in the DVD format. But watch closely; you'll notice many subtle, sophisticated things which other viewers have touched on in earlier reviews. The animation is almost surreal-- so incredibly lifelike that it abandons its cute, 'Disneyesque' pretensions from previous fairy tales. There are no talking mice, dogs or cats anywhere to be seen. Here the animals are silent, as animals are supposed to be. (I love the sequence with the forest animals as they are awakened by the singing of the barefoot princess and join up with her, like multiple chaperons, in harmonious whistles.) Even the fairy godmothers- who may initially appear as sugary stereotypes- spend so much time bickering (well, two of them do anyway) that you get to identify them as thoroughly fleshed out personalities. The adaptation of the original Perrault fairy tale is also impressive. An ingenious move was to have the prince and princess meet in the forest *first* and fall in love- unaware that they are already engaged to be married. Someone mentioned the chilling sequence which shows the princess, cloaked in an eerie green pallor, actually being lured to the fateful spinning wheel. So dark, so frightening- when was the last time you saw something like this in a Disney fairy tale? And then immediately afterwords is a cleansing sequence of unmatched beauty showing the fairies sailing through the sky like fireflies, magically dusting the rest of the castle to sleep. It is, of course, only matched by the film's finale which shows storm clouds, lightning, a forest of thorns, and a flame-spewing dragon-- all seamlessly bringing the story to a 75-minute conclusion. It stands, in my opinion, as Disney's masterpiece.",Sleeping Beauty
96,StreepFan126,one of the Disney Greats,10,17 June 2002,"This is one of the best Disney film ever.  It has a great story, it is not to sappy, and it has the best villainess, that Disney has ever created. Maleficent, the witch, is without a doubt, one of the best villains of any movie or TV show.  She takes her place right among Catwoman and Kathy Bates in Misery. If she were not the villain, the movie wouldn't be half what it is.",Sleeping Beauty
97,SofiaHedge,Overall entertaining!,7,30 July 2020,"Sleeping Beauty is a classic in many ways. However, by today's standards, it's missing one thing: a strong female protagonist.Look, before you say anything, I understand that the 50s' were a very different time, especially for women. I understand that people had very different expectations for women; they expected them to be quiet, pretty, and obedient. There weren't a lot of options for women back then. They weren't expected to do a lot. But it kind of bugs me that Aurora, the film's female lead, doesn't get as many lines as the other characters. In fact, she has the least amount of lines of any Disney Princess, and that kind of annoys me sometimes. And besides, the majority of what she does in the movie is sing, dance, dream about her prince, and sleep. That's mostly it. That also really bugs me sometimes.But on the bright side, the film has spectacular art, unforgettable music, and excellent storytelling. And while Aurora basically plays the damsel in this movie, her elegance, charm, and kindness make her an overall likeable character. So this film is an overall great movie and is very fun to watch.",Sleeping Beauty
98,robert3750,This is the Disney I love,9,1 December 2019,"I don't care for the Disney Corporation of today. They have badly tarnished their own intellectual properties and that of George Lucas. Sleeping Beauty is a product of Disney as it used to be, under the visionary leadership of Walt. It's a film for all dreamers, for all hopeless romantics, for all who would like fairy tales to be true. When Flora speaks the line ""Sword of Truth, fly swift and sure, that evil die and good endure"", I get chills, and I buy into it completely. The animation is very good, if not quite up to the standard set by Disney's Pinocchio. ""Upon A Dream"" is a wonderful song that makes excellent use of the classic Tchaikovsky ballet score. Highly recommended!",Sleeping Beauty
99,travisimo,The Quiet Masterpiece,9,16 January 2004,"Sleeping Beauty was the first Disney movie my parents bought for my sisters and I.  That was a long time ago and numerous Disney movies later, I've almost forgotten about Disney's third animated feature.  It was never really my favorite as a kid, maybe because as some reviewers have said, it has a great amount of appeal to adults.  The story is kind of darker with no talking animals, and Maleficent, who is probably the meanest and bitterest of all the Disney villains, makes a reference to hell.  That's something you don't see everyday in a Disney movie.Nevertheless, this movie is still to be appreciated by young and old alike. Walt Disney and his staff never cease to amaze me on their ambitious efforts.  While I think Snow White's animation is more colorful and lively, Sleeping Beauty seems to have a unique animation style all its own.  At first glance, I wasn't too impressed with the forest scenes, but looking again, they almost have a different artistic style, maybe reminiscent of the time period and setting that the movie takes place.  Furthermore, I heard that Disney made this film to accompany a widescreen-type format.  Now how in the world did he see that coming?!Sleeping Beauty doesn't have the most colorful or bounciest story, but it is unique compared to other Disney flicks.  As I wrote earlier, the villain is just absolutely diabolical, and the prince in this movie actually sacrifices his life and battles an army of followers and a sinister dragon.  But what makes Sleeping Beauty stand out the most is its magnificent score based on Tchaikovsky's ballad of the same name.  The songs are pretty good too with the hilarious drinking song Skumps (another indication this was aimed at adults) and my favorite, Once Upon a Dream, which reminds me of visiting Disneyland and the Magic Kingdom.All in all, Sleeping Beauty is a fine contribution to the Disney legacy.  It may not stand out as much as Snow White or Bambi, but it definitely should not be forgotten.My IMDb Rating: 9/10.  My Yahoo! Grade: A- (Almost Perfect)",Sleeping Beauty
100,datautisticgamer-74853,?,7,30 April 2016,"As my aunt's personal favorite Disney movie, I have absolutely no idea what to say about Sleeping Beauty other than the fact that I merely enjoyed it. The magic is stellar as always, and the action is satisfactory, but I didn't feel the ""THIS IS THE BEST Disney MOVIE EVER!"" vibe that I felt with Mary Poppins after seeing both of them. It might be a result of fantasy (as I mentioned, magic plays a major role, like the argument over a dress color) and action (Maleficent vs. Philip) that, in the style that it was executed, wasn't a particular trigger of my animation taste buds. The animation is just what we'd expect from Disney, but one case in particular caught my eye: Aurora. Specifically, Aurora was animated predominantly by Iwao Takamoto, who you Hanna-Barbera and Warner Bros. fans might recognize as the creator of Scooby-Doo. The style that Aurora was drawn in gave me flashbacks to when I loved The Scooby-Doo Show, and so even though that came 10 to 18 years after Sleeping Beauty, I enjoyed the film slightly more when I made that connection. If you're unfamiliar with Scooby-Doo and its style, then you might want to consider seeing that before viewing Sleeping Beauty. Not my personal favorite, but nevertheless worth a view.",Sleeping Beauty
101,Hup234!,The last of the great Disney romantic films.,10,16 November 2000,"I saw this theatrically, twice at time-of-release, and then decades later in re-release. The rich tapestry of animation, plot, and marvelous Tschiakovsky music make this mandatory viewing and listening for all except the very young. I recall at the time missing the original and lush Disney-style animation I had grown up with. Having seen ""Snow White"", ""Pinocchio"", ""Fantasia"", ""Dumbo"", ""Cinderella"", ""Alice in Wonderland"", and all the other Thirties-Forties Disney Studios classics, ""Sleeping Beauty"" uses a somewhat more sparse and flat look then in vogue with avant-garde animators. In retrospect, however, I think the 'look' of ""Sleeping Beauty"" has held up well, unlike many of the experimental super-minimalist animation efforts of that time. Background artist Eyvind Earle had said he was attempting a 'primitive' look, with emphasis on vertical and horizontal lines, in the manner of Botticelli but with Persian and Japanese influences. (Notice that the trees are squared.) Looking back, this creativity does lend a mood of fantasy and surrealism, in order with the theme.If I missed the ""Bambi"" look in 1959, however, today I miss the ""Sleeping Beauty"" look, and sound, among all the recent Disney efforts!
This really was the end of an era at Disney, a 'serious' and romantic story with glorious songs and music. Here Disney once again elevated his audience, giving us immortal music with a full chorus and the incomparable voice of Mary Costa (and compare to the feeble, forgettable tunes and 'pop'-style singers of recent Disney offerings). See and hear ""Sleeping Beauty"" and remember how it was before the 'knack' was seemingly lost. Highly recommended. ****",Sleeping Beauty

103,n-mo,C.S. Lewis was right,7,24 October 2010,"There is a lot to like about ""Sleeping Beauty."" If you are in the mood to listen to bits of the Tchaikovskï ballet and look at pretty pictures at the same time, this is the place to be. The action is wonderfully attuned to the musical rhythm and the visuals are fully worthy of the audio accompaniment. No animated feature even comes close to this in terms of both artistic skill and immaculate taste. Princess Aurora is without a doubt the most beautiful of the Disney princesses.Regrettably, Aurora's beauty and lovely singing voice are about the only things one can say about her. The original story (first-part only) is, as with other Disney features, altered significantly to make it more producible and fleshed-out for a two-hour film, but in expanding the role of the Good Fairies, Disney condemned himself to reducing their number: it would hardly have been conceivable to explore the personalities of the seven in the original story. Consequently, the original six gifts--beauty, kindness, grace, dance, song and instrumentality--are reduced to simply beauty and song. Was this intentional?Still, the presentation of royal mentality and obligation is remarkable for a twentieth-century American film, and the wicked fairy Maleficent is by far the best Disney villain: truly wicked and yet herself graceful and sleek--apparently a powerful noble peer of the kingdom of Stefan and Leah. She is the perfect foil for the Good Fairies, whose personalities and ethereal generosity might call to mind a kind group of religious sisters.Overall, a decent take that does not totally degrade the themes and symbols of the original, despite a bit of watering down on the ""love's first kiss"" bit and a rather unexploited personality for the Princess Aurora. I suppose this bothers me less than the fact that this beautiful maid has in recent years become a rather vulgarized product.",Sleeping Beauty
104,abrafocus,Not that good,4,15 March 2006,"I have mixed feelings about this movie.For one thing, I know we wouldn't have a Sleeping Beauty castle in Disneyland, which I've been too a lot lately, since it's the 50th Anniversary celebration, and I know that the Firework's display is excellent, with the special effects on the castle.The music is 100% stupid. It sounds like it was recorded in a garbage truck. No offense to Mary Costa, but it went completely overboard with the ""I Know You,"" bit. My 13-year old sister used to sing that song all the time, and it was dreadfully annoying. Luckily, she doesn't sing it much anymore.Even without the songs, it would be bad. I just don't think it was 100% well-done.A few voices could have been changed, the songs could have been cut, amidst a hundred other things.My score: 4/10.",Sleeping Beauty
105,tmpj,Disney Imitates Disney....,5,27 August 2010,"Disney's animation projects appeared to be running out of steam in this warmed over, under the radar imitation of ""Snow White"". The animation world had changed dramatically in the 22 years since Disney first delved into features. This one, while charming and darkly scary to some, was a bit of a bore for me. I could never really get ""Snow White"" out of my head. The similarities in the stories should have been enough to tell Walt to let it go...and let someone else do this one. Snow White had a Prince who kissed her and broke the spell...so does Sleeping Beauty. Wicked Witches? Both stories have one. But the first time was the best time, and in this film Disney had no real message. As for Fairy Godmothers...Cinderella had one...and he cast some of the same people over and over again to add to the monotony. Verna Felton comes to mind. She was a familiar figure on TV by now, as well as having been a familiar and identifiable voice on radio in the 40s with Judy Canova as well as Eve Arden...amongst others. Snow White and Sleeping Beauty both survived murder plots against them. Both were of royal blood...the similarities are striking. As I watched the making of this feature in the short film afterwards, I wondered how Walt could look into the camera with a straight face and claim anything new or strikingly original about this film. The technology had advanced, of course...but none of it was his...or very little of it. It was shot on 70mm film because the film world was being choked to death by TV, and processes such as Cinemascope were coming into play in a vain effort to recapture the once captive theater audience that would never again be captive. The film was successful and Walt made his money...but that was largely marketing...he had something now that he did not have when Snow White was in theatrical release...and that was the millions of baby-boomers who were not yet born when Snow White was made. But a lot of them would see Snow White, and would voice the same similarities at one point or another that are being voiced here. Not to take anything away from Disney...his encounters early on in his career had sharpened his business sense. But, for me, Sleeping Beauty is more an entertainment vehicle and a money maker, and not one of the truly innovative Disney films. In fact, as animation became more and more condensed as the 60s came around, Disney, as well as his animation counterparts in other arenas, would come to rely more upon development of characters as real animation was thrown to the four winds. This feature was made just prior to the animation low point in which Disney films would languish until the late 1980s or early 90s, when interest in animation would be revitalized. I can say no more about Sleeping Beauty other than some may find entertainment value in it. But I prefer Snow White over Sleeping Beauty any day of the week.",Sleeping Beauty
106,phillindholm,Hail to the Princess Aurora!,9,9 July 2006,"""Sleeping Beauty"" was envisioned by the great Walt Disney as his masterpiece--the feature-length cartoon par excellence. And, in many ways, it is. The then-record budget (six million dollars) was the largest ever for an animated motion picture. The widescreen Technirama 70 process had never been used for an animated feature. The six-track magnetic stereo sound was a step upward from the ""Fantasound"" system employed in ""Fantasia"" (1940). Also new and trend-setting was the style of the animation--a more realistic, geometric design which, surprisingly left many critics and audiences cold. The extra expense needed to showcase the widescreen film properly, together with the lukewarm reviews, prevented ""Sleeping Beauty"" from turning a profit at the box office when it was released (with much fanfare) in 1959. But time has been kind to the film, subsequent reissues have finally put it in the profit margin, and both viewers and critics are appreciating it for the beautiful fantasy it has always been. However, like it's predecessor ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" (1937) which was Disney's first fairy tale, as well as his first full-length film, this screen adaptation of ""Sleeping Beauty"" strays from it's origins. While the Charles Perrault version of the tale is given as the source, there are new variations. The original story is as follows: When a baby girl is born to a King and Queen, they invite seven (or, in the Grimm version, twelve) Fairies to the christening. Uninvited is an evil fairy, who shows up anyway, and curses the child with death on her 16th birthday. Although a good fairy is able to alter the spell, the princess is doomed to sleep (along with the court) for 100 years. Despite the precautions taken, the curse is fulfilled (accidentally, in most versions of the story) and the princess does indeed sleep for a century, after which a prince awakens her. Understandably, Disney's telling departs from Perrault here as well, because in Perrault's version, the King and Queen are the sole members of the court who do not succumb to the sleeping spell, and, eventually die of old age. The Disney version of the tale whittles the number of good fairies down to three, giving them the appearance and personalities of elderly women. Meanwhile, the evil fairy, dubbed Maleficent, is a cold, flamboyant villainess who, for better or worse, overshadows everyone else in the film (but then, the villain always does). Disney's retelling also dispenses with the Heroine's 100 year sleep which lasts merely one night. There is much emphasis put on the three fairies who secretly, in the guise of peasants, raise the baby princess Aurora, (whom they dub ""Briar Rose"" interestingly, the name given the Princess in the Grimm retelling) and, unwittingly make it possible for Maleficent to execute her curse. Also new, is the introduction at the beginning of the film of Prince Phillip, who is immediately betrothed to Aurora. The climatic battle he has with the evil fairy, here transformed into a dragon, has become one of the most memorable parts of the film, though it was purely the scriptwriter's invention. In the end, however, it is best to appreciate the film as a stand-alone creation, rather than a faithful adaptation of a classic story. Indeed, as some latter-day critics have pointed out, ""Sleeping Beauty"" has been embraced by the young and old audiences who find in it many of the same sword and sorcery elements in films like ""Legend"" and ""Excalibur"". And every penny of it's then-unprecedented budget is on the screen. One marvels at the intricate design of the animation, all accomplished well before the advent of computers, which the Technirama screen showcases to full effect. The voice talent is perfect. Mary Costa, who went on to an estimable opera career, is a lovely and expressive Aurora, while Bill Shirley is an ingratiating Prince Phillip. Eleanor Audley (so deliciously cold as the stepmother in Disney's ""Cinderella"") is the embodiment of majestic evil as Maleficent. Verna Felton (the Fairy Godmother in Disney's ""Cinderella""), Barbara Jo Allen and Barbara Luddy are the delightful (and all too human) fairies, Flora, Fauna and Merryweather. Aurora's father, King Stefan, is voiced by Taylor Holmes, with Bill Thompson as Phillip's father King Hubert. A word should also be said for Candy Candido, who provided the sounds made by Maleficent's goons. The Tchaykovsky ballet score provides both the background music and melodies used for the new songs. All this blends perfectly in an epic adventure/fantasy seldom experienced on screen, and one with enough heart to capture the most cynical viewer. The Special Edition DVD, released in 2003, and currently out of print, is another example of what a ""Special Edition"" truly encompasses, including a fully restored widescreen print of the film, a new 5.1 stereo mix which fully showcases the Academy Award nominated score, as well as many bonus features with appeal to all ages (including a widescreen/fullscreen comparison which should be the last word on that subject). Also included are several complimentary historical shorts like the Academy Award winning ""Grand Canyon"" which accompanied ""Sleeping Beauty"" on it's initial release. Trailers, games, interviews with Mary Costa and surviving animators, vintage featurettes which delve into the making of the film, and last, but not least, footage of Disney himself, complete the dazzling package. Finally awakened from her long slumber, and more refreshingly lovely than ever, ""Sleeping Beauty"" is a film (and DVD) for the ages.",Sleeping Beauty
107,Marx_Bros_Fan86,Almost a classic,6,27 November 2010,"Sleeping Beauty had the highest budget of all the Disney movies at the time and it showed. The design of the characters and the settings is so exquisite at times it feels like you are watching cartoon characters in REAL places. I wish movie studios still made cartoons that looked like this. The other highlight of the film is Maleficent, the evil witch. She had the best character design in the film. She was performed by Eleanor Audley, also famous for playing Cinderella's stepmother, one of the best voice actors in Disney history. Maleficent is probably the best villain from Disney's classic era. Her transformation into a Dragon is the most memorable scene in the film. Beyond that, there really isn't much going for this film. The biggest problem is the lack of a strong main character. Aurora is asleep for most of the film, which was unavoidable, but they could have at least given the Prince a bigger role. The three fairies become the main characters by default, and while they make for an entertaining trio, they're just not enough to fill the void. Once Upon a Dream, the film's theme song, is only memorable for the Tchaikovsky music it is set to. Compared to classics like ""Someday my Prince will come"" and ""When you Wish Upon a Star,"" it does not compare.It's still worth watching for the animation and Maleficent, but it's not surprising that this film has been overshadowed.",Sleeping Beauty

112,bonniejoy-978-68763,Magical,10,17 September 2014,"As a kid this was among my top favorite Disney movies! So many things in there were amazing while others didn't quite work well.The art is amazing! It's not like anything Disney ever did before. It looks like Medieval tapestry and it's just brilliant. When I look at the hall of the king, the courts, or the forest I keep thinking that I'm seeing actual artwork and not just moving cartoon characters from pencil sketches. I'm serious when I say the background pictures ought to be in a museum one day; they're just that good!The music, I love it! They're catchy, memorable, and beautiful. When I say ""catchy"" I don't mean that they have a beat from rock 'n roll or anything like that, in fact nothing in the movie is modern related, it's all a Medieval setting. And in comparison to recent Disney movies, that says a lot! I haven't seen the original ballet, but I've heard that this is where the music came from or is based off of. I still sing Once Upon a Dream a lot, which is still one of my favorite songs. The characters (most of them) are just memorable. The fairies are my favorites. In fact I compare them to my two sisters and I because of their personalities matching ours (older: leader-like, middle: gentle and kind, youngest: feisty and defensive). Fauna is still my favorite fairy mostly because she and I have so much in common, including that we like green and are gentle. Maleficent is a great villainess! I won't falter that. She's just a great sorceress and sometimes it can be hard to tell if she'll take bad news well or furiously and how extreme she'll react. The fact that she can also turn into a dragon is scary! Her magic is also scary. If you get on her wrong side, then she could kill you off. How frightening is that?The main flaw I have with the movie are the main characters. I'll start with Prince Philip. Before The Little Mermaid, Disney seemed to stereotype guys in a Disney Princess movie to just be the bold, singing, say nothing hero. After about the second half of the movie he says nothing. All he does is play the dashing hero with the sword, and don't get me wrong, the fight scene is intense and amazing, but wouldn't you want to hear him say something after 30 minutes of him talking in the middle of the film? Now we get the Princess herself, Aurora. She was my favorite princess, but the problem was the story is called Sleeping Beauty and we see less of her ironically (not counting when she's asleep) and more of the fairies. Shouldn't this be renamed The Three Fairies? I like her, but she should have been the focus of the movie rather than the fairies, the kings, and other side characters.I still love this film. It has it's flaws, but most of the time it is a colossal epic and worth watching.",Sleeping Beauty
113,zactac,A true timeless classic and one of Disney's finest moments.,10,11 May 2010,"This is a film that was made for a big finale. And Walt Disney didn't disappoint, for this was the last fairy-tale film he supervised before the great entertainer passed in 1966. Sleeping Beauty is a film filled with captivating animation, beautiful music, and loving characters.The film starts off with the revealing of the princess Aurora and how the kingdom loved her and even the three good fairies Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather loved the young princess. However as the fairies were giving their gifts to the princess the powerful and evil Maleficent arrives. Angry at the fact that she was not wanted at the celebration she curses the young princess to prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and die. However with the final gift the curse is altered so that she will not die but just sleep until her true loves kiss breaks the curse.This story is filled with romance, adventure, sorrow, and even laughter. It is this movie where we meet who is probably the most devious and powerful of the Disney villains. Maleficent is scary, powerful, and is such a dark character you wouldn't believe this is actual Disney animation. But I think that's the best part of the film. Not a single thing is to childish to where you can't enjoy it. We find a world filled with enchanting characters, some of the most realistic animation I have ever seen, and a villain that makes all other Disney villains look like grunts. This is definitely one of the best animated films ever made.",Sleeping Beauty

116,robynh-4,Beautiful.,10,28 November 2007,"""Sleeping Beauty"" is one of Disney's best movies as well as one of their most beautiful. The animation is stunning, the song ""Once Apon A Dream"" is gorgeous and the voice acting is superb.The Story: Aurora is the beautiful daughter of a king and queen. On the day of her birth, three good fairies (Flora, Fauna and Merryweather) come to bless her with beauty and song, but along comes bad fairy Maleficent (who was voted #1 of Disney's top 30 Villains), puts a curse on Aurora that she'll die on her 16th birthday when she pricks her finger on a spinning wheel. Merryweather counters the curse that, instead of dying, Aurora will simply sleep until true love's first kiss breaks the spell. That is, her fiancé Prince Phillip has to kiss her. The fairies end up fostering Aurora, much to the grief of the king and queen, for protection and change her name to Briar Rose, again for protection. However, the curse takes place on Aurora/Briar Rose's 16th birthday. The fairies put everyone else in the kingdom to sleep and free Phillip after Maleficent holds him prisoner. Now Phillip has to play the hero and save the day with the help of the fairies.I highly recommend this movie, especially if you want some of Disney's classic gold, much unlike the CGI that's being made nowadays. It's another childhood favourite and both kids and adults will fall under the spell of the movies audacious narrative style, animation, songs and humour.",Sleeping Beauty
117,StartingAllOver14,The Sleeping Beauty has woken up again,7,28 December 2009,"Last year, with the release of the Platinum Edition of «Sleeping Beauty», my curiosity for the film woke up, cause it's was a while since I last time saw it. I bought the new DVD and got a pleasant re-acquaintance with «Sleeping Beauty». I won't call it my favorite Disney classic of all time, but it's definitively a entertaining and enchanting Disney classic for Disney-lovers to enjoy. «Sleeping Beauty» is, layer-wise, also one of Disney's most interesting films for an adult viewer, cause the film deals with pretty dark elements. I'll actually claim that adults may enjoy the film more than the kids, cause there are some really frightening scenes. I saw «Sleeping Beauty» first time when I was eight years old and it was one of the few Disney films that actually scared me. Of course if the younger kids are going to be scared depends on how easy they are to scare, but I'll still state that parents should think twice before showing this film to the youngest family members, cause some scenes, accompanied with gloomy music, are enough to make a traumatic impact on kids (speaking of which, a earlier friend of mine got scared by the dragon and didn't wanted to see the film until he grew up).In spite of «Sleeping Beauty"" being really dark, it's a pretty lighthearted film, too. There are some wonderful, classical Disney moments here, which I'm going to talk more about later. But first about the characters.The best of them are without doubt the Goodfaires, which are the most present characters too. Fauna is my personal favorite. Other likable characters are Prince Philip's father, King Hubert and the horse, Samson. To claim the two lovebirds, Prince Philip and Princess Aurora, as passive characters may be unfair, but unfortunately that's the truth. But in return, they've been given wonderful singing voices by Mary Costa and Bill Shirley. And Aurora's character design is interesting, too. Malificent, on the other hand, is one of Disney's most memorable villains and there's no reason to wonder why; With her calm, collected, but cold presence she's sure to be memorized by every child and Disney villain (and I personally think she's sort of cute too). I used to think that her monster-like helpers were quite annoying, but not anymore.As mentioned, there are many wonderful and spectacular scenes; The climatic dragon-fight is one of them, but Aurora's journey towards the spinning wheel in the castle is a chilling sequence. And the sequences with her in the woods along with all the animals and her Prince is pure Disney magic, as is all the scenes with the Three Goodfaires. The animation is beautiful and the widescreen format suites this movie well, as the Tchaikowsky-music does. It was a perfect fit for the movie, by giving it more substance and sophistication, actually. Except for ""Hail To The Princess Aurora"", the songs are quite enchanting, although they haven't been the most mentioned ones from Disney. In spite of the screenplay being quite straightforward and predictable (like you can expect from Disney at that time), there are some clever twists on the love story, which catches the interest of the viewers.So don't miss ""Sleeping Beauty"". It's a entertaining and cute film for every Disney fans to enjoy.",Sleeping Beauty
118,joliefille411,Exquisite,10,26 April 2007,"This movie gets 10 points on it's look alone. It is stunning to watch, especially in the widescreen format. The amount of detail and effort that went into it blows my mind. Being an art student, I appreciate this kind of work tremendously. The music is also exquisite, taken from the famous ballet.The story is good enough- I love the feisty Merriweather, and it has my favorite prince- Phillip. He was the first Disney prince to actually have any development or really do something. Another thing is this movie is not goofy at all! Yes, it has some cutesy forest creatures, but they don't talk and they aren't overly cartooney. Instead, there is some truly funny dialogue and situational comedy that doesn't pander to a 5 year old sensibility. Besides, we have Maleficent, an amazing, dark, seductive villain. She is never weak or unintimidating. I would be terrified to go against her.Overall, one of my favorite Disney films alongside Hunchback and Beauty and the Beast. The most beautiful piece of animation ever- hands down.Quote of the film:You poor simple fools. Thinking you could defeat me, ME! The Mistress of All Evil!",Sleeping Beauty

120,djansen24,Almost totally formulaic,5,9 July 2012,"Sleeping Beauty is a disappointment for Disney. If it were the first animated feature ever made or even the first ""princess meets prince - falls in love - they live happily ever after"" animated feature, it would be fairly decent. But compared with Cinderella and Snow White, Sleeping Beauty falls very far behind. The animation fluidity is very smooth, an improvement on Snow White, but that is where the magic ends. The backgrounds are less detailed, the extras on the screen are given little to no movement, and the color palette is mostly primary colors. The story is one we've all heard before, but no time is invested in the characters (save for the 3 fairies...who fail to delight) to spice things up. What made the fairy tales of Snow White and Cinderella so wonderful was the attention to detail, both in animation and characters. We got to know their personalities, their motivations, their quirks. For example, the magnificently drawn villain, Malificent, is given no reason for being bad. She just comes and lays a curse upon people and creates havoc because...well, I guess she just has nothing better to do... In this movie, Disney seems to be going through the motions. Take note: more time is given to showing the storybook flipping through the pages and more narration is used to move us through the plot. Had Disney focused less on the plot and more on the characters relating to each other, the movie would have been much more interesting. There is nothing in Sleeping Beauty that is original, nothing they haven't done better earlier. Such a pity this was the last movie Walt produced before he died. It was the end of their classic era. Even the music is lacking with the Princess Aurora song and the song between the 2 kings being some of the silliest music they ever recorded. Only one great tune (The Once Upon a Dream song) stands above the rest. They clearly knew that it was their one good song since it is sung over and over again throughout the movie. So why am I giving this movie a 5 and not lower? Because it is a competent movie. It is skillfully pieced together and flows smoothly. It will be a delight to children. On its own, it is decent. It pales in comparison to other great Disney films. Sleepy Beauty is a perfect example of a skilled studio cutting corners and putting out a product without a lot of love poured into it.",Sleeping Beauty
121,medic249a2,My 2nd favorite Disney movie,9,14 June 2005,"Sleeping Beauty remains a Disney classic, even 30 years after I first saw it. Walt's method of storytelling is unmatched, even today. Combine this with the beautiful melody of Tchaikovsky's waltz, re-arranged to make 'Once Upon a Dream', and the sinister character of Maleficent, who in both human and dragon form casts a terrifying presence.It begins when the Princess Aurora is born to King Stefan & his wife. The whole kingdom, along with 3 good fairies - Flora, Fauna & Merryweather - come to the castle to bestow gifts on the child. However, the evil sorceress Maleficent also makes an appearance, and Merryweather's temper gets the better of her. She makes a rude statement that incites the sorceress to put a horrible curse on Aurora; that by the end of her 16th birthday, she will touch her finger to a poisoned spinning wheel - and DIE! Merryweather tries to undo the damage by altering the curse so that Aurora will instead be confined to an ageless sleep to be broken by love's 1st kiss. Wisely, however, the king orders that all spinning wheels in the kingdom be burned as a precaution, and the 3 fairies take Aurora to their cottage in the woods - away from Maleficent's spies - and raise her as their own child, named Briar Rose. On her 16th birthday Rose meets Prince Phillip - the son of a neighboring king whose own kingdom will soon unite with King Stefan's. When the 3 fairies get careless with their wands, Maleficent finds out Aurora's location and tricks her into touching a spinning wheel - and her evil prophecy is fulfilled! The sorceress then sets a trap in the cottage, and her army of brutes overpowers the Prince and takes him to Maleficent's castle on the Forbidden Mountain. The 3 fairies, upon discovering Phillip has been kidnapped, go to the Forbidden Mountain and set the Prince free. But it isn't long before they are spotted, and Maleficent's army of brutes attacks with arrows, rocks & boiling oil. The enraged Maleficent then directs her evil spells at the fleeing Prince - sending up a forest of thorns as thick as weeds to surround King Stefan's castle. When the Prince gets through, she lands on the road in front of him, blocking his path. Then comes one of the most terrifying scenes in Disney film - Maleficent turns herself into a massive, frightening dragon! She quickly drives Phillip back through the forest, and forces him onto a towering cliff, with no way out but down - into a raging pit of flame! The Prince then loses his shield with a blow from Maleficent's fiery breath. Will the Prince's bravery be enough to overcome Maleficent's evil powers?This is one of the more intense of the Disney films made in the classic age of Disney movies. In my view the artwork is far superior to the digital images of today, especially considering the painstaking effort that went into making them.9/10",Sleeping Beauty
122,stiv-7,Disney animation attains perfection,10,10 March 2003,"What more can I say than what is said above? Sleeping Beauty is the perfect Disney animated feature. I have loved it since I was a small boy and have never stopped loving it. It has the perfect musical score (adapted from Tchaikovsky), absolutely gorgeous Technicolor, and was shot in Technirama. Much as I love other Disney films from this early period, this one still stands out as being the most beautiful and least dated. It is simply a beauty to behold, and needs to be seen more often. On the dress front, I always thought Aurora looked better in blue. 'Nuff said.",Sleeping Beauty
123,CinemaCocoa,A childhood favourite. I ADORE it.,10,12 July 2014,"Possibly the definition of style-over-substance, I can barely explain why I love this film above all other Disney films... It almost ditches everything narrative to provide one of the greatest villains of all time. For me the film is hardwired: I love it.The story is as simple as they come. When Princess Aurora is born, she is blessed by the three good fairies with life-long gifts of beauty and song, but another fairy, the wicked Maleficent, curses the child to be killed before her sixteenth birthday. Only one true love can possibly save Aurora should the curse be fulfilled.Even though my feelings for this film are deep, deep down in my heart and cannot be explained (when I started Cinema Cocoa, on my Top 50 films, this came 16th) I will admit there are issues with it. It is terribly simplistic. Our characters have next to no motivation or any character outside of classic archetypes. Aurora could be any number of Disney princesses; she starts out life hidden away from Maleficent's knowledge by the ditsy three fairies Flora, Fauna and Merryweather, and while nowadays she might have become ditsy herself (ie Tangled) Aurora becomes... completely unassuming and quite bland. She walks in the forest, singing about her one true love, talks with animals, sings some more. But you can see she is at least curious, if a little ignorant. Our Prince, Prince Phillip, is even more generic and not very memorable (his noble horse is of course a classic Disney character). No... all of Sleeping Beauty's power (and terror) radiates from the merciless Maleficent, and while she too has virtually no characterisation either outside of being the antagonist (she wasn't invited to the Royal party?? That would make anyone mad!) the film gives her so much gravitas and absolute menace. She hardly shows herself, but her scenes are easily, easily the most memorable moments and will sear themselves into any young child's mind forever. From her curse, to the mesmerising and haunting Spinning Wheel scene, to of course... the finale. The finale to end all finales, so short but so intense. I could happily go on and on about her.So do I purely enjoy this film for its antagonist? Probably; Maleficent is at the centre of my love for villains, but Sleeping Beauty's soundtrack is wonderful, haunting and very memorable. I've not watched it in years but the visuals are very striking too. Even on the old posters it says: ""Wondrous to see, glorious to hear"".A lot of it is aimed at girls, I admit. Most of the film is following the three fairies taking care of Aurora in their hideaway (failing to bake cakes and make dresses) and with only their mistakes to drive the plot forward. Aurora's constant singing about her elusive dream of her Prince Charming. A couple of kings who rather needlessly fill time with comedic singing and drinking (reminds me of another favourite: The Sword in the Stone) there's plenty to find irksome for the modern viewer.I guess I am just smitten with it. I still get chills towards the end. A film normally requires good characters to envelope me into caring and fearing for their lives by the end... but Sleeping Beauty doesn't do that (at least not for me); it instead sells one of film's greatest villains and the terrible wrath she happily bestows upon the hapless.I love it.",Sleeping Beauty
124,CalvinValjean,This Is Art,10,13 May 2008,"The phrase ""style over substance"" comes up often in criticism, and Disney's SLEEPING BEAUTY is no exception. The story is admittedly-thin, and the characters are fairly shallow. The title character, Princess Aurora, is really a supporting character, and it's the three fairies who instead carry the story. The great ""romance"" of the movie consists of one awkward conversation between the prince and princess, and then they live happily ever after once she awakens, without saying so much as a word.But I don't say this as a condemnation. The old Disney fairy tales were never known for their depth. In fact, I would say it wasn't until BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, THE LION KING, POCAHONTAS, and THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME that Disney animation really began to have depth of plot and far more developed female characters. Audiences themselves have matured over time.What does make SLEEPING BEAUTY stand out is its stylized approach. The animation resembles medieval paintings, the music is by Tchaikovsky, and the tone of the narrative is lyrical and sombre. Take a scene where Aurora sings with the animals. This scene of course is a Disney convention (the recent film ENCHANTED poked fun of it). But frankly, this time the scene is superior to its counterpart in SNOW WHITE or Cinderella, due to the haunting quality of the song ""I Wonder"" and Mary Costa's ethereal vocals. The entire sequence is hypnotic, and resembles a ballet more than a cartoon. It is soon followed by a stand alone sequence worthy of a standing ovation, in which Aurora falls under an enchantment, bathed in a sinister green glow, making her way towards the cursed spinning wheel.But no review of this movie is ever complete without a mention of one character who I've been saving. As many have said before me, Maleficent remains the best villain in the Disney canon. She is not goofy or slapstick-ish as later Disney villains became, but calm and calculating. To me, her best scene is one where she is not even doing something menacing, but instead shows her restrained sadism; she visits the imprisoned prince and shows him a vision of his likely future, mentally tormenting him. As she exits the cell, she comments that she will now sleep well for the first time in sixteen years. Such was the extent of her obsession of power.As a kid, not only was I scared of her; I was scared of even looking at the video box cover, just because she was in the bottom right corner! At a mere 75 minutes, this movie holds everything that made the Disney legacy worthwhile. It has humor, darkness, enchantment, and a sense of wonder at a world we will never inhabit. It is a sleeping beauty to behold.",Sleeping Beauty
125,bek-12,Fantastic!,9,22 November 2003,"The old cliche, ""they don't make 'em like they used to"" is certainly true here.  I grew up on Disney animation in the 70s-90s and even today.  I used to think Disney has pretty good animation.  I'd never seen anything from them as old as this movie.  The animation is SO MUCH SMOOTHER and more realistic than the stuff Disney cranks out today.  You can actually take the villain in this movie seriously, as opposed to the ""gnashing teeth"" villains in today's Disney movies.  Everything today has been so watered down and ""PC"" that the scary edge is gone.Disney, take a clue from your old work.  Sleeping Beauty is enjoyable by both kids and adults, yet doesn't need subtle references to adult topics in order to maintain that enjoyability.This easily ranks 9/10.",Sleeping Beauty
126,flyingamon,If it weren't for these silly fairies I would have loved it,6,21 April 2011,"I haven't seen this one as a kid and I have no idea why. I love this fairy tale though. Seeing it as an adult I expected something along the lines of Snow White and Cinderella.Indeed princess Aurora does have a scene where she sings and dances with some animals, which seem to be obligatory in Disney movies about princesses. But I think that's where the comparison stops. The humor is mostly provided by the fairies which is a good thing for children. The problem is not so much that the fairies are silly but that they take such an important role in the story having more screen time than princess Aurora who is supposed to be the real star. That the marriage between Aurora and prince Philip was a politically arranged one took away from the charm of how I remembered it as kid. However I liked the fact they gave him some more background than in the original fairy tale. What really disappointed me was the role of Aurora's mother which was pretty non-existent. It is completely taken over by the fairies. Scenes taking place in the castle are completely into the hands of the father. Aurora doesn't know she is a princess, doesn't have any bond with her parents while she had such a strong relationship with her mother in the original tale. Good that Maleficent was such a convincingly scary villain or otherwise I wouldn't think of ever watching this one again. Giving it a 6 seems to be much given my ranting but that is mostly because I didn't like the changes they made to the original tale. Others might have loved this different approach and it seems fresh but it wasn't for me. It wasn't a bad movie just not what I expected or hoped.",Sleeping Beauty
127,bmbdsm,Spellbinding Disney masterpiece!,10,7 December 2012,"Everyone knows the classic fairy tale of SLEEPING BEAUTY. A beautiful princess is cursed to a long sleep by a wicked fairy, and can only be awakened by the kiss of true love. Luckily, a prince comes, kisses her, and lives happily ever after.This is, without a doubt, one of the best films ever put out by Disney. Every time I watch it, I am bowled over by the film's artistry. The film was the first animated film to be photographed in 70mm, and it was well worth it. Evyind Earle's legendary background styling is quite magnificent, and makes good use of the widescreen. The characters are wonderful, particularly the three good fairies who try to rescue Princess Aurora, and the self-proclaimed ""Mistress of All Evil,"" Maleficent, brought chillingly to life by Eleanor Audley (who previously portrayed Cinderella's stepmother for Disney). The highlight of the film, for me, is the background music, adapted from the famous ballet of the same name by Tchaikovsky. This is easily Disney's best score, an exquisite piece of work. The quality of the recording is so crystal clear, it sounds like it was recorded yesterday, giving the orchestra a pure, lush sound. Some wonderful lyrical songs appear, enhanced by excellent choral work and the voices of Mary Costa and Bill Shirley as the Princess Aurora and Prince Phillip. I could go on and on about this movie.

The fairies were cute, but not enough screen-time was given to them in my opinion. My favorite scene in the movie is when they sew the dress, it was very entertaining as well.Most of the movie however seems very slow, dreary and boring. When I was a child, I found the ending way too dark and it also spanned for a very long time in the movie. I would rather have seen more of the fairies and Aurora. The only song I remember is ""Once upon a dream"". Many of the characters aren't very interesting either, I remember there is a very long scene with the kings having a toast and the only mildly entertaining was the bard.

But one Disney film has always remained my utter favorite and that is, indeed, ""Sleeping Beauty.""Like most children, I grew up watching Disney movies -- everything from animated films like ""Snow White"" to ""Lady and the Tramp,"" the semi-animated like ""Mary Poppins"" and ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks,"" and the non-animated such as ""The Parent Trap"" and ""Old Yeller.""  But ""Sleeping Beauty"" remains my favorite animated movie and you'd better believe at seventeen years of age, I'm still watching it.  I cannot believe how the animation has been knocked in some reviews -- it's beautiful!  They captured the medieval period so well and even the people look like, well, people.  The score is beautiful and the songs ""I Wonder"" and ""Once Upon a Dream"" are sung wonderfully by Mary Costa.  What a voice!  Aurora is by far one of the prettiest Disney princesses (one thing that initially drew me to the movie as a child), following the formula with those trademark doe-eyes that Disney bestows upon all of their princesses and heroines.  Prince Phillip actually does more than just show up to sing a song and say one line, a welcome change that answers the age old question, ""What does she see in him anyway?"" The three fairies are delightful (I always wanted to be Fauna!) and funny. And of course, there's the quintessential villain -- Maleficent.  She scared me when I was younger and when I view the film now, no wonder.  (For the longest time, I was also scared of Eleanor Audley period, but she's truly a marvelous actress.)  And when Phillip kills her -- yeah, you'd better believe that's some scary business.  The story is beautiful and funny, the animation is divine, the music ethereal, and the voice talents extraordinary.  This is a personal favorite and it comes highly recommended!",Sleeping Beauty
130,marcusman48,Tolkien and Tchaikovsky meet at the Magic Kingdom,8,25 October 2007,"Walt Disney - whether as cartoonist, filmmaker, impresario, or business mogul - was so innovative in so many ways that some of his more distinctive innovations tend to get lost in the shuffle. One important way in which he was a pioneer was the introduction of European expressionistic film techniques to American family audiences. This truth is rarely acknowledged, but it had enormous consequences for popular culture. While the expressionist style had been employed by American filmmakers before, Disney was the first to fuse that aesthetic with the bubblegum realm in which he dealt - the realm of fairy tales, caricatures, and slapstick. This marriage of high and low cultural forms would pave the way for many filmmakers in the years ahead, the most obvious example probably being Tim Burton (who started out, appropriately enough, as a Disney animator). And perhaps no animated feature that Walt oversaw between the 1930s and his death in 1966 exemplifies this style as superbly as SLEEPING BEAUTY.Even while watching this as a child, I readily grasped that SLEEPING BEAUTY was of a breed quite different from most of what Disney had created either before or since. Perhaps most obviously, the animation is about as exquisite as one could hope from a movie made in the days before computer technology. Unlike the forest in SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS, for example, the forest in this film looks real. There is some depth to it, as well as a juxtaposition of light and shade. It is the kind of forest that seems to harbor secrets - a place where you would not be at all shocked to stumble upon a lonely cottage or see the mysterious flickering of fluorescent lights in the night.Even more profound, however, is the film's provocative thematic language. Though the story itself - the rescue of a princess from the forces of evil by a swashbuckling prince and his fairy allies - is starkly simple, the setting is finely textured both psychologically and culturally. Prior to the 1990s, this was probably Disney's most morally mature work; evil here is not some freakish or even alien phenomenon, but something disturbingly ordinary that seems to stalk the characters through every moment of their lives. The Gothic citadel of the wicked sprite Maleficent, from its perch atop Forbidden Mountain, looms over the countryside as a permanent and highly visible threat. When night falls, the heroic characters scuttle fearfully through the dusky shadows that extend over the land; it can be difficult to tell friend from foe. When the naive Prince Philip knocks on the door of Aurora's cottage and hears a sweet female voice greeting him, he has no way of knowing that a mob of batlike demons is about to fall upon him.SLEEPING BEAUTY holds the rare distinction of being both universalist and groundbreaking. To a child, everything is immediately recognizable: the forest, the castle, Maleficent's lair. But Disney goes even further, imbuing each locale with an individual and wholly organic character that nonetheless collectively constitutes a thematic whole. It is hard to put a name to such a luscious style (medieval Gothic expressionist?); but the nooks and crannies would eventually find their way into other Disney films (most notably THE SWORD IN THE STONE) and then into other multimedia entertainments. Perhaps a little ironically, Disney was - whether consciously or not - drawing upon idioms that existed in 1950s culture but had yet to register on the mass-media radar. Most obviously, his knack for rendering rich landscapes and evoking themes that united pagan fantasy with Christian morality owed much to the mythology created by J. R. R. Tolkien of THE LORD OF THE RINGS fame. (It is difficult not to liken Forbidden Mountain to Mount Doom, where the climax of THE RETURN OF THE KING takes place.) Baby-boomers who might have seen SLEEPING BEAUTY as children would almost surely have noticed its motifs retooled in the 1960s paperback editions of Tolkien's books, and later in the fairy-tale rock of such 1970s musical groups as Led Zeppelin, Rainbow, and Heart.And speaking of music, there is only one instance in which the ballets of Tchaikovsky were more perfectly realized in cinematic form: Disney's other expressionist masterpiece, FANTASIA. Tchaikovsky's composing style is ideal for the staging of fairy tales: more than any other composer of the nineteenth century, he possessed a talent for writing music that called to mind such rarefied notions and images that it seemed almost to be otherworldly. (Igor Stravinsky, whose RITE OF SPRING was also memorably mounted in a sequence in FANTASIA, is another such composer.) Some traditionalists were appalled by the interweaving of original lyrics with Tchaikovsky's immortal music in SLEEPING BEAUTY; but considering that the lyrics fit the music perfectly, I didn't mind at all.SLEEPING BEAUTY takes place in a Manichean world of extremes, where the eternal questions of existence must be forcefully answered and where the villain must not be merely defeated but destroyed. And it is one of the few Disney films to acknowledge a world beyond: ""Now you will deal with me....and all the powers of HELL!"" But if there is a Hell, there must be a Heaven: Aurora and Philip do live ""happily ever after,"" but not without a period of trial where it must be decided whether ""evil die and good endure.""",Sleeping Beauty

Some detriments to this movie are that it wasted a lot of time on insignificant scenes, thus dragging out the movie and lowering the overall enjoyment of the film. I didn't really care for the characters as much as I do for other Disney characters, which is a result of fair buildup and poor character development.

132,Registered_User,In a class by itself.,8,31 May 2002,"Sleeping Beauty is a golden Disney movie. It's so picturesque and brilliant. Whenever I put this on it gives me a deep sense of peace and comfort. There's something magical in the animation of the woods, creatures and castles. Just like reading a Brothers Grimm tale, it transports the viewer to a dreamy place in the past. You can't help but fall in love with the three faeries: Flora, Fauna and Merriwether. They guide the ravishing Briar Rose (AKA Princess Aurora) to brace her fate and to meet Prince Phillip, the Prince Charming of every girl's dream. The evil is dark and foreboding, and the good is light and beautiful. I think it's very much like Sword in the Stone (another excellent one) in the sense that the animation is splendid and it takes place in the medievel times...that alone conjures up visions of enchantment. Watch out for a cute line said by Prince Phillip to his father when he tries to persuade him that marrying someone under your rank is OK. ""After all..it's 1435"" or something on that order..ahh it's pretty cute. So simple, such good storytelling...fabulous.",Sleeping Beauty
133,WilliamOTyler,Disney's crowning achievement,10,29 January 2016,"There are some classic movies that you get to know so well, that eventually you think you can just put it on as background noise while you do other stuff, but if you happen to look up at the screen for one moment, you are completely captivated and kept from looking away until the credits have rolled. Walt Disney's Sleeping Beauty is one of those movies. This animated production is that rare, perfect alignment of masters of their crafts, like Marc Davis, directing animator of both the film's protagonist and antagonist, and painter Eyvind Earle who served here as production designer, among many other artists, that creates something wonderfully unlike anything else. When it was decided to do Sleeping Beauty, the company knew they would have to push the artistry further than they ever had before to purposefully make the film stand out from everything that had ever come before it. The story's medieval setting perfectly caters to this with Gothic architecture, patterned tapestries, sculpted box trees and other hyper detailed background elements. To match, Disney ditched the soft and round and inviting characters that they usually portray for character designs that are more jagged and angular, strong with deep straight and vertical lines. The detail of the film really is just staggering. Add to that the fact that this was all done in Super Technirama 70 means not only more detailed art, but physically larger portions of art needed to be created to fill the film's frame, and every single frame from this film could be a framed painting hanging in a museum all on its own.Just as your eyes finally settle from all the detail and you think the movie couldn't be any more perfect, it happens. A blustery wind and a flash of lightening introduces you to the most iconic villain in all of the Disney stable. If anyone can crash a party and completely steal a show, it is Maleficent, which is a feat from a character with very little action. She's a speech giver, which means her captivation comes completely from her design, her slight movements, her voice, and her overall demanding presence. She can stand completely still and yet you will never lose her within the intricacies of the settings around her because you will never even take your eyes off of her. A spell has truly been cast, and while our princess has the least amount of lines for any human title character in a Disney animated movie, Maleficent more than fills the stage, making the movie really all about her.Other characters, like the film's hero Prince Phillip, are also more well rounded than the archetype had been in previous Disney films, and he would have to be to even enter into such a dark and threatening climatic battle. This Dark Ages atmosphere of Sleeping Beauty is spurned on by its classical score, a brilliant arrangement by George Bruns of the original music from the Sleeping Beauty ballet composed by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. The idea to take this well known music and reset it to the events of the movie adds weight and seriousness, as well as an heir of familiarity. It also does well to heighten certain moments in the film to truly chilling and mesmerizing states.It's a wonder that the film was a failure upon its initial release. The increase to its art and production meant that it was also Disney's most expensive animated film to date, and unfortunately could not make its money back at the box office, resulting in quite a change in style at the studio. The company's next release would be the scratchily designed 101 Dalmatians, with Sleeping Beauty ending the era of the lush and overly romantic Disney animated film. It has since gained both its money back and popularity, though, considered by many to be one of Disney's crowning achievements. As for me, I am perfectly comfortable in going further than that to call Sleeping Beauty the best animated film of all time.",Sleeping Beauty

138,nintendogs03,ugh!,5,30 September 2012,"I would never bring a Disney movie down, but I have to for Sleeping Beauty. It's just not that great compared to Cinderella and The Little Mermaid. Here's why...1)Maleficent has the worst plans ever! Like who would poison a baby just because she wasn't invited to a birthday party? It's not evil or harsh, just really stupid. I would understand if the good fairies turned her castle into cupcakes and rainbows or if her minions turn into happy elves who loves Christmas and sings dumb songs about coconuts and cats. I admit that the dragon scene is cool, but in all of reality, she's terrible2)Prince Philip did NOT stab Maleficent. If those good fairies were not by his side, Maleficent in dragon form would have stepped on him like if he was an ant, burn him to a crisp, or eat him like he was tootsie rolls. The fairies put the curse on the sword and killed the dragon.3)Aurora doesn't do anything expect when she dances with the prince 2 times. I find her so boring to watch and she's my least favorite Disney princess. She's also very stupid. Doesn't she know how sharp the tip of the spindle wheel gets? Why did the fairies not teach her about the spindle wheel? This reminds me of a time where some guy told me to take some pot and it's good for your body. If Aurora was in this situation, she would be a pot addict. Let's get back to the subject4)The first scene where the people came for Aurora's Christening scares me. I don't know why, it just does. It's not even Maleficent, it's just the music and the poor animation combined which makes it look freaky.I really don't know what to say about this movie. It's just bad. If Maleficent has good logic and all that, she would be the only thing I like about this movie. Hopefully Angelina Jolie will be better as her in 2014. I doubt that",Sleeping Beauty
139,MyNeighborFanboy,Beautiful,9,17 September 2010,"Sleeping Beauty is one of the few pre-60s products in which Walt Disney seems to be relinquishing some of his authorship to another figure. That man is art director Evyind Earle, who handles some of the most intricate and gorgeously composed backgrounds in all of animation, as daring in their placement of different colors with each other as in their grand scope.Unfortunately, Disney's great animators were less than thrilled with Earle's input, which they saw as undermining their own work, and they are correct in that this seems to be the least animation driven and most design driven of any Disney product outside of some of Ward Kimball's UPA-inspired shorts. Every frame looks like a tapestry, but the animation seemed a bit stifled behind the heavy details and many shades of color. This isn't a bad thing per se: Sleeping Beauty is one of Disney's better works.This is all in spite of the main characters. I've complained about the prince and princess characters in past Disney movies, but this is pushing it. Aurora's a vapid bimbo with pretty hair that replaces her brain. Prince Phillip, often complained about by his animator the great Milt Kahl for his extreme technical difficulty and personality-free demeanor, is a great achievement in terms of moving realistic forms around believably, but is also a violently boring individual who probably just wants to get with Aurora to prove he isn't a closet homosexual. As with so many other Disney movies, however, these flaws are largely made up for by one of the great villains in Maleficent, a milestone character in animator Marc Davis's career. Granted, it probably wasn't in Disney's best interest to adapt faithfully a story which features implied rape among other things, but it takes one of the greatest formal art jobs to make up for the shallow butchering that is this film's narrative.I'm making this all sound much worse than it is, however. For all this film's flaws, it is a great Disney film through and through, and a visual experiment fully on par with those of the Golden Age features. As with all of Disney's greatest works, there are sequences of the most remarkable beauty. Phillip's battle with Maleficent in dragon form (animated by Wolfgang Reitherman) is jaw dropping, and anytime Maleficent in either form shows up is bound to stick in the viewer's memory. Unfortunately, what it doesn't have that made Dumbo or Pinocchio or Bambi or even Lady and the Tramp great is an engrossing story. We enjoy the set-pieces and the visuals, and that's enough.Sadly, the film was big a bomb as other Disney experiments as Fantasia and Pinocchio, and Disney never really recovered this time. They resorted to cheaper and cheaper production methods following this film, and Walt Disney himself began steadily to lose interest in feature animation, instead turning his attention to his theme park.However, the first film to fall victim to these methods would actually wind up being all the better for them, and one of the finest films in the studio's history.",Sleeping Beauty
140,Stenian,So unlike the source material and too childish,3,26 December 2020,"Of course, this is Disney in the golden era. So their movies are supposed to be more kiddie-like, campy and light-hearted in nature. But that wasn't the worst part. This just wasn't close to the classic fairy tale. It deviated and strayed off a little too much, and rather offensively so!First off, in this film, the Princess only sleeps for a few days. The prince comes and kisses her, and she wakes up. That seemed like a rehash of Snow White (1937). But in the story she slept for 100 years, with everyone in the castle sleeping with her (so she won't be distressed to find out that they'd be long dead after she wakes up). In the tale, the Prince was not even born when the Princess was around. But in the film, they know each other before the whole curse thing and would sing ""Once Upon A Dream"" together (that was a good song though). They were only put together because Disney felt like it, and because Cinderella (1950) did it - You know, a prince and a princess must sing together, right?That's a huge diversion from the source material, and not a very good one, as the most interesting thing about fairy tale is the Princess sleeping for a century only to be awaken by a prince, who has been seeking her for many years after hearing about the legend. Pretty sad that they haven't made any more Sleeping Beauty films that stick close to the source.The fairies were rather annoying and some pesky characters (like the two kings) were totally unneeded. The songs were also bad and cheesy. Not to mention, I really did not like that typical Disney trademark with birds and other animals ""communicating"" with the Princess. Must this happen in all Disney movies? Enough already. Thanks for ruining this classic fairy tale film.",Sleeping Beauty

143,Centaurus3,5th out of 8 in the Silver Era,6,18 April 2013,"About 4 years after Lady and the Tramp and with the 50s coming to an end, Sleeping Beauty was released.The story is about three fairies named Flora, Fauna, and Merrywether who has to watch over Princess Aurora for 16 years to protect her from Maleficent's curse. On her 16th birthday, Aurora meets and falls in love with Prince Philip. After the fairies returned Aurora to the castle, Aurora is cursed and Phillip needs to kiss her to wake her up, but first needs to fight Maleficent.This movie has the most boring characters yet, as everybody except the fairies and to an extent Maleficent are extremely bland. Aurora is in the movie for about 18 minutes in the film, and all she does is sing, dance with animals and Phillip, cries when she has to marry the Prince, and wheels after getting cursed. You do not get to see her character, and she is a typical princess in distress. Phillip is an improvement above the previous princes, but no by much; he gets a name, and has a bit more lines than they do. He appears in the film longer, but he only speaks in half of his scenes, and is still bland. Maleficent is dark, creepy, and cruel, but there is a part of her that is also boring and bland. The parents are just your royal parents who want to marry their kids off. The fairies are the only saving grace; Flora is the bossy one, Fauna is the peace keeper, and Merryweather is a loudmouth. The few songs that are in the movie are very good. ""I Wonder/Once Upon a Dream"" is sung beautifully, and definitely brings out the medieval style in the songs and the score. The animation also gulfs itself in the medieval theme, and this is definitely the best animated Disney film yet. Each frame is a piece of art, and you could pause the movie anywhere, print screen it, and you have a piece of art, but unfortunately, songs and animation does not make a good movie.The story has a few plot holes, but even if it did not, the movie is extremely boring, and it is very easy to drift off. This also has to do with the mostly boring cast of characters. The animation and songs are beautiful, but everything else falls flat. If you want to watch a classic Disney Princess film, a medieval themed movie, and a beautifully animated movie, give this movie a watch, but don't expect to get too invested in the film",Sleeping Beauty
144,starzinhereyes7,A nostalgic masterpiece,8,12 August 2010,"This film is a lot like its princess – sweet, beautiful to look at and listen to, has nothing particularly profound to say but is a lovely presence nonetheless.John Grant notes in The Encyclopedia of Walt Disney Characters that when it was released, the film disappointed critics expecting another Snow Whiter or Cinderella, as well as those hoping for something new. On the one hand, the films follow the same basic formula – a demure princess, an ineffectual prince, an elegant villainess, and bumbling troupe of supporting characters who end up saving the day. But things aren't quite the same. Aurora may be as innocent as Snow White but her blonde beauty suggests a Cinderella. Philip and Snow White's prince have the same approach to picking up girls, but Philip does more for his damsel than provide a well-timed kiss, and he acts a good deal more like a smug teenager than his predecessors. Maleficent (voiced by the same actress who voiced Cinderella's stepmother) might be described as the evil queen but with a sense of humor (albeit a sadistic one).So it didn't generate as much love as its predecessors. And how about now? Is it too sexist? Sure, a raging feminist could have a field day pointing out what's wrong with the film's weak-willed princess who perpetually dreams of romance. To stamp this film as ""sexist,"" however, ignores that the central conflict is between women – older women, in fact! All the other characters are essentially pawns on the chess board where Maleficent and the three good fairies battle. It doesn't help matters, of course, that the three good fairies are so saccharine and grandmotherly. Up until about three-quarters through the film, the three sprites do not seem competent enough to bake a cake, let alone slay a dragon. But then there's Maleficent. Wow. She's so frightening as a gaunt sorceress that her magnificent transformation into a smiling, slithering dragon seems almost redundant. It's hard to be completely at ease at any point in the film, knowing that Maleficent might be hiding in the fireplace or in the cottage, watching and waiting. That she could be all this and still be such a magnetic, sexy character serves as justification enough for adults to watch and enjoy this film.There's a chance Sleeping Beauty will fade away as a kid's movie. Parents of the future might hide it away, not wanting their daughters to start floating around the house singing about the boys at their preschool. Children of the future might find it too scary, or maybe even too boring. Given the loud, fast-paced nature of modern kid's films, it's hard to imagine the scene where Aurora sings an aria as she strolls through the woods making the cut.So while fading away may be inevitable, I really hope that doesn't happen. Criticisms aside, this film is a masterpiece. The same impulse that compelled Disney to pair classical music with experimental animation in Fantasia seems to inspire Sleeping Beauty. The animation is unlike anything before or after – much more like a moving tapestry than a Saturday morning cartoon. Aurora and Maleficent may be the two most graceful women in animation, and they are truly pleasure to watch. They move as gracefully as ballet dancers, unsurprisingly since the music comes from Tchaikovsky's ballet. There are parts of Fantasia that just don't work, and it's nearly impossible to get a kid to sit through the whole thing. But here, it works. Perhaps because Sleeping Beauty is a coherent story rather than a series of sequences, although it has more than a few jokey or ostentatiously animated sequences that don't move the plot an inch. Mostly, it works because the animation and the music complement each other beautifully, the one making the other romantic or haunting as the story dictates.But what does this story really ""mean""? Again, nothing profound. Be kind. Be brave. Stamp out evil where you can. This is a Disney film, after all. But it's a lovely one, and in a culture where a forgettable cartoon film seems to be churned out every month, I applaud the effort to create a film that is at once a work of art and children's entertainment. So maybe one day it will be considered more of a feat of animation than a great film for the kids. I just hope it doesn't slip away entirely.",Sleeping Beauty

Not to mention the dreadful Queen of Darkness, her devils, which are truly ugly and frightful... And the moment when she grows up into something incredibly dark and enormous, up to the very clouds (you want, in spite of yourself, to close the eyes and not to see).

148,thomas2193,The end of an era,9,24 November 2014,"The 1950's were tumultuous years for the Walt Disney Company. Cinderella was a huge hit when it was released in 1950 and was so profitable for the company that they were able to release a string of classic features and were also able to create Disneyland, which opened in 1955. Due to the fact that Walt Disney had a lot of things on his mind during the second half of the 1950's, he wasn't involved as much in the production of Sleeping Beauty as he was in the earlier Disney classics. It took a decade to finish what would be the last classic of Disney's Golden Era. Sleeping Beauty was known as the most expensive animated feature of all time when it was released in 1959. Unfortunately, Sleeping Beauty did not do well at the Box Office and received mixed reviews from critics upon its release.Based on the fairytale by The Brothers Grimm 'Little Briar Rose', Sleeping Beauty is a medieval story about princess Aurora (voiced by Mary Costa), who gets cursed by the evil Maleficent (voiced by Eleanor Audley). Before the sun sets on her 16th birthday, Aurora will prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and die. The fairy Merrywheater uses her blessing for the princess to change the curse. Instead of dying, Aurora will fall asleep and can only awake by true love's first kiss. Aurora grows up as Briar Rose with the three fairies; Flora, Fauna and Merrywheater in order to guarantee her safety from the evil Maleficent. She doesn't know that she's a princess, until the day of the 16th birthday, after she's met Prince Philip, without being aware he's a prince. When she returns to the cottage where she and the fairies live, she tells them about the prince, but the fairies have to tell her she can't see the boy anymore, because she's Princess Aurora. She needs to return to the castle of her parents. Aurora gets tricked by Maleficent and touches the spindle of a spinning wheel. The fairies cast a spell on all the inhabitants of the kingdom to make sure they are all asleep. Maleficent kidnaps Prince Philip, who was attempting to pay Briar Rose a visit in the cottage. The fairies manage to help Philip escape from Maleficent, but Maleficent attempts to stop him from reaching Aurora. She turns into a dragon, but Philip manages to stab her in the heart with a sword. Maleficent dies and Philip kisses Aurora, so she wakes up and they marry.Sleeping Beauty may not be the best Disney Classic of all time, but it's one of my personal favorites. The animation is as good as it has ever been in any of the Disney films. The costs were high, but the result is mind-blowing. The music is really good and works perfectly well within the theme of the film. The main characters aren't very interesting, especially Briar Rose (Aurora). She only gets about 20 minutes of screen time, which is strange for a main character. That's definitely a flaw. On top of that, she isn't very interesting. Her singing voice is boring, which is evident in the long scene where she meets Prince Philip (voiced by Bill Shirley). This scene is one of the weakest moments in Sleeping Beauty. Aside from that scene, Aurora doesn't bother me that much, though. The other characters are far more interesting. Maleficent is a fantastic villain. She's evil and malicious. That's what a villain is supposed to be. Her design is perfect as well. She looks evil, but beautiful at the same time. There's always a mysterious aura surrounding her. Eleanor Audley also voiced 'Lady Tremaine' in Cinderella, another great Disney villain. Her voice work for Maleficent works perfectly. Philip is a lot better developed than most of the Disney princes, but in the final part of the film, where he escapes from Maleficent and awakes Aurora, he doesn't say a word which feels a little odd. The two kings, Hubert (Philip's father) and Stefan (Aurora's father) are pretty funny and share a good deal of chemistry. Their scenes might be filler since they don't add much to the plot, but I do enjoy them so I never had a problem with them. The three fairies are great characters. They all have different personalities. I especially like Merrywheater, who's goodhearted but can also lose her temper. The fairies really add up to the overall quality of the film. With the exception of the long scene where Aurora meets Philip for the first time, everything in Sleeping Beauty works for me. The animation alone would be worthy of a view, because it's simply perfect and will never be topped. Sleeping Beauty is the culmination of Disney's Golden Era and can be called a masterpiece.",Sleeping Beauty

Widescreen? Why do you need widescreen in animation? Because it gives another layer of depth to the scene, not to mention the best, purest animation that the old school studio artists ever did. Earlier work like ""Snow White"", ""Pinnochio"", ""Dumbo"", ""Peter Pan"" -- all indisputably great, but they look like, well, cartoons. ""Sleeping Beauty"" looks like an actual film - rich in color, detail, staging, etc.And this is all, of course, rooted in one thing, which the unbelievably convincing artistry of the Disney staff in creating this world. The scene when Maleficent sneaks into Aurora's dressing room via the fireplace - with the dim lights, the chilly music, the perfectly timed explosion - it looks like Hitchcock more than Disney!

Prince Eric is not the flat, undeveloped stereotypes that are found in Snow White, Cinderella, or even to a lesser degree in more modern films like The Little Mermaid.

153,matthewhedrich,Good movie but could have done better with Aurora and King Stefan,7,9 April 2021,"I always enjoyed Sleeping Beauty when I was a kid but I have discovered some flaws that were in Sleeping Beauty such as the character developments of Aurora and King Stefan. Another flaw could be the voice cast, especially when Taylor Holmes was mistakenly casted as King Stefan.For Aurora, she only has 18 lines and less screen time of the film. She does not have have specific personality whatsoever, same goes with Queen Leah. I wonder why they decided to make Aurora a less active character. God knows why. She is a false protagonist and remains asleep during the climax until she awakens at the end of the film. This makes Flora, Merryweather and Fauna the real protagonists of the film. I don't hate Aurora as she's still beautiful and gorgeous but she could have done betterFor King Stefan, he is portrayed as a depressed and stressful King of France who is way overprotective about the safety of his only daughter Aurora. What's lame about Stefan is that the late Taylor Holmes (in his last role) gave a bland performance for Stefan that made Holmes unenthusiastic in some scenes he's in as the voice of King Stefan. He sounds too old and depressing as well. That's why King Stefan has to become my least favorite Disney father and character of the movie, NOT counting Disney Princess Enchanted Tales Follow Your Dreams where Corey Burton did better as Stefan. What's more bad is that Holmes replaced Stefan's original voice actor, Hans Conried. This created the unsolved mystery of Lord Duke's voice that was never solved, in a similar matter of Jack Ruby murdering John F Kennedy's accused assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald. That has to be my biggest flaw and Disney's biggest mistake on Sleeping Beauty. Had Holmes turned down the role, Stefan would have been my favorite character of the movie. In fact, Conried would have been a perfect and better choice for Stefan, as heard in the demo recording, ""It Happens I have a Picture"", which was mistakenly removed from the film as in favor of George Bruns' music adaptation of Tchaikovsky's ballet score of the same name of the Disney film. I always felt that it was a stupid decision for Walt to do this, even though I appreciate him for his idea for the score to be based off of Tchaikovsky l's score that was adapted by George Bruns. I mean come on, it has more humor and potential for Kings Stefan and Hubert to have more humor, especially for Stefan before becoming sad when Maleficent curses Aurora. Had that song not been removed it would have been one of two songs, written by Jack Lawrence and Sammy Fain, that were kept in the film. At least Conried probably voiced Duke, who speaks in a Mid Atlantic accent like Conried, but it was done in high pitched.Nonetheless, this movie is still pretty good, the characters (Sir Minstrel, Flora/Merryweather/Fauna, Maleficent, King Hubert, and Prince Phillip) are fun (except King Stefan, Queen Leah, Diablo, and Maleficent's Goons), the music is wonderful, and the artwork were visually stunning and a wonderful masterpiece.",Sleeping Beauty
154,Disneylover34,An underrated classic.,9,10 August 2021,"To state the obvious, the animation in this movie is some of the most beautiful in any Disney feature. The story while simple is timeless and engaging. The original story brought fantasy and wonder to little girls and boys alike. This film does the same for all who watch it. The comedy in this film was surprisingly good and clever for the simple story and characters. The characters are all equally memorable, with some standouts such as the fairy's and Sleeping Beauty herself. However, easily the most memorable and maybe the most iconic character/villain in all of Disney depending on who you ask is the absolute show stopper, Maleficent. This Villain is intimidating, scary and clever all at once. The finale of this picture is ingrained in all minds of Disney watchers. The music while few and far between is elegant and beautiful. The only issue with this film is Prince Phillip. He lacks dialogue and is mostly just there to drive the plot, Disney seemed to miss the mark to give him any real character traits. Overall, this movie is a must watch and should be in any animated film lovers regular watch rotation.",Sleeping Beauty

I loved all the scenery, probably because I'm a fan of Medieval themes and thought here it was a nice twist by Walt. All the songs and vocal work are as luscious and pure than any Disney flick before or after it in my opinion. From the storybook beginning ""Sweet Aurora"" chime on, it seems as though the harmonizers were vying for your attention over the main characters. Maleficent is by far the best character in the film and probably the greatest Disney villain ever to step onto the screen. Her uncalled-for level of evil and mystique over not being invited to Aurora's celebration is far beyond any level of evil her counterparts could dream of. 10/10 Purely magic.",Sleeping Beauty
157,castielfan89,Not anything to really care about,5,4 October 2017,"This movie was so boring until the very ending. The music is forgettable and Aurora (Sleeping Beauty) is the worst Disney princess she has nothing going for her in anyway. Her voice isn't too good, her looks don't really stand out and she has no character development I mean she's only in 18 minutes of the film. This was wasted potential she could have been better if they tried. The only thing that saves this movie from being utter trash is Maleficent. Her humor I funny and she is a delight to watch as well as watching the prince go out to save the princess. Trust me all you have to do is watch the first 10 mins and the skip to the last 30 mineutes and you will perfectly fine.",Sleeping Beauty
158,sweet_em_sexy,One of the best Disney movies made.,8,1 February 2000,"Sleeping Beauty is absolutely one of the best Disney movies ever made, truely standing the test of time even now forty years after it's creation. The art work is lush and vibrant even by today's standards. Princess Aurora is one of the most beautiful of Disney's heroines, making it quite easy to see why the Prince would fall in love with her at first sight. But the real star of the movie is Maleficent. As a child, she was the only Disney baddie to ever truely scare me. She commits all these acts of pure evil and terror merely because she wants too. Not only is her curse terrifying but to actually think of the sixteen years of torture that the king and queen went through can make one realize just how manical Maleficent is. She is the best of all the Disney villians, certainly more so than the lackluster villian from Tarzan. This one is the ONE to compare all Disney movies by.",Sleeping Beauty
159,pladdleduck,Disney's Greatest Film,10,26 October 2006,"This is my absolute favorite Disney movie ever! As a little girl, I would watch this captivating love story time and again, and I still watch it, and I love every moment. This movie has everything a Disney story should have; comedy, drama, love, hate, good, evil, and most importantly--music! Disney writers today do not write their own music (they use pop music that stinks) and also, though the movies are directed at a young audience, the jokes and puns in the movies are often only understood by adults, and they go straight over the children's heads.Anyway, i love the songs in this film. I love Tchaikovsky, and the lyrics that the Disney writers accompanied along with them is just spectacular! The art is very unique, in that the aimators imitated Medieval artwork. No other Disney production used that technique. I also think Prince Philip is the most handsome Disney male and Aurora is the most beautiful Disney female. This is the quintessential Disney movie. A 10. Superb. The Best.",Sleeping Beauty
160,blueseas,Romantic classic,10,8 November 2004,"One of the first books that I read as a child was the Disney version of Sleeping Beauty. From that moment onwards, this story captivated me as no other before. The ideas of love at first sight, pure evil, and the goodness of others were all exemplified in this story, and even as a child, I recognized the wonderment of the story.When I actually saw the movie for the first time, though, I must admit. I was a bit disappointed. I felt the drawing of Aurora was too angular and not realistic enough for me. QUICK SPOILER warning!!! I also thought that Prince Phillip was too much of a wuss in the movie - the fairies had to guide him in every step and produce the next step for him as he battled Maleficent. I missed that part of character in the book. END SPOILER.However, putting all that aside, I was still enchanted by the movie. The use of Tchaikovsky's Sleeping Beauty only augmented the beauty of the movie, and heightened the romantic appeal. It was beautiful watching the two fall in love as they danced and sang together. That scene gives a false sense of security that makes the rest of the movie much more exciting. I loved Maleficent, and I must agree with others who feel that Maleficent is the best villain. Even compared to other Disney villains, Maleficent is clearly the most powerful: she has magical ability, decent henchmen(the raven), is never comical(thus making her cruelty much more noticeable), and embodies pure evil. While this movie may not be the best for all, it will always be one of my favorites due to the combination of so many elements that make the film much more realistic than you would believe for a Disney movie. In all simplicity, it is a story of how you must overcome obstacles in order to acquire true love, and such a story is eternal.",Sleeping Beauty
161,Brunehaut,A masterpiece of animation,10,13 March 2018,"Sure, I can understand why some people dislike the ""blank"" princess Aurora or feel more entertained by funnier movies. But I will always have a great admiration for Sleeping Beauty - its animation is beyond words. The visual is so beautiful, elegant, and flawless that is simply fills all the scenaristic flaws. All these forest scenes, the handsome Philip, Aurora herself (as a fan of Audrey Hepburn I always think of her when I watch this Disney) : only one word can cover what is is : beautiful. 
I am more than impressed by the titanic work done on that movie. I also hope that one day, another Disney movie would adopt a similar graphic style, because this one is spectacular.
Timeless and delicate songs too, and Disney's best villain: the awesome Maleficent!",Sleeping Beauty
162,Julia-50,This is my favourite fairytale.,10,11 December 1999,"This is my favourite Disney movie.  It may not look as good as The Little Mermaid, or the Lion King, but there is just something about it.  The story is so romantic, and Maleficent is the coolest Disney villain ever.  I love it when she says, ""You poor simple fools, thinking you could defeat me, ME, the mistress of all evil!  Well here's your precious princess.""  I used to have the record and the book that you read along with, and I wasn't quite old enough to read, but people thought I could 'cause I'd memorized the story!  This is an excellent movie for people like me who love happy endings.",Sleeping Beauty
163,workshyslacker,One of the best Disney animated fairy tales of all time,8,17 June 2010,"I watched this when I was younger and I didn't like it. Why? There weren't enough cute, furry animals or catchy songs to hold my attention. The colours also looked faded and dull. I kept wondering why Aurora's hair looked a dirty blonde yet it was described as ""sunshine gold"". The characters seemed a little flat, and most of the dialogue went over my head.I re-watched this movie (as the 2 disc Platinum edition) nearly 18 years later and my opinion has completely changed. The animation, sound and colours have been restored to their former glory to when it was first shown in 1959. The previous editions on VHS and re-issues in the cinema were of the aged, dirty film with a deteriorating soundtrack. I felt short-changed; my opinion of the film was affected by watching the less than pristine version.I think ""Sleeping Beauty"" as a whole appeals more to adults than children. The animation is top-notch and specifically styled to look like a medieval tapestry, and the dialogue is sophisticated and fluent. The plot a little more subtle than I remembered. Maleficent's soliloquy is bone-chillingly perfect. Her plan diabolical; she intends not to kill the Prince but to imprison him so after 100 years he will awaken his princess who has not aged (!) I can't imagine a crueler fate than to know that precious time afforded by love will be stolen from you. All too often Disney villains are painted with broad comical brush strokes and it is difficult to fear them. Here, Maleficent is truly evil; intent on destroying peoples' lives on just a whim; being snubbed at a party.This also the first time Disney gave the Prince a name. He is given subtleties never before afforded to his predecessors; warmth, humour, flirtatious and witty; ""Now, Father, this is the fourteenth century..."" There are dark segments to this film that may not be appropriate for the very young, the thrilling final battle with the dragon may be too scary. In my opinion, it is one of the best sequences of good vs evil that has never been topped for sheer adrenaline (except maybe the end of ""The Little Mermaid"").True, there are problems with the film. The titular character has very little to do and little screen time. The cute animals don't sit well with the sharp, angular patterns of the backgrounds. The fairies dominate the story and perhaps more time should have been given to the interaction between Aurora and Philip.The use of Tchaikovsky's score gives the movie a timeless quality but also a more subdued feel than the rousing scores of other Disney movies e.g. Aladdin, that certainly didn't appeal to me as a child.So if you didn't like this movie initially, I urge you to watch it again in its restored format. I felt I was watching it for the first time.",Sleeping Beauty
164,TamzinSniper,To all the feminist out there...,10,21 February 2014,"Give this movie another watch without prejudice. Don't watch this movie thinking about how the beautiful princess gets rescued by a beautiful prince and then call it sexist trash. I feel like people aren't giving these princess movies much of a chance. People are afraid of things they don't get. This movie is based on a ballet. And a centuries old fairytale, that is far darker and twisted then this Disney version. A pinch of understanding will make a big difference on how you see this movie. People want the princess to be a wild bohemian woman of the forest instead of a elegant soft mannered girl (like its such a BAD thing). Sleeping beauty probably has more female characters then in most Disney princess movies. Aurora, Flora, Fauna, Merryweather, Maleficent. They each show different forms of femininity. Aurora - the beautiful teen princess, The three elderly good fairies - Flora, Fauna and Merryweather, Maleficent - the glamorous evil witch. The story itself is very simple and straightforward, but look and listen closely or you can miss the subtle details. A lot happens on Auroras first birthday. Everyone in the kingdom rejoices for the blessed birth of their new princess. Hail to the Princess Aurora! Then Flora blesses baby Aurora with the Gift of Beauty, while Fauna gave the child the Gift of Song. Before Merryweather could give the child her gift, Maleficent appeared and invoked a curse that would cause the princess to die upon pricking her finger on the spindle of spinning wheel. Her feelings were hurt that she wasn't invited to Auroras B-day bash. Merryweather though was able to weaken it and provide a means for the curse to be broken. Instead of dying, Aurora would instead fall into a deep sleep from which only True Love's Kiss would awaken her, breaking the spell. Oh and before all that Aurora is betrothed to a 7 year old Prince Phillip. The three good fairies come up with a plan to take Aurora from the palace and raise her as their own, deep and secluded in the forest were Maleficent wont find her. Very simple. Here's a list to shorten things up.Aurora is beautiful inside and out. Shes not just a pretty face, her kindness is shown through her forest animal friends. Shes a symbol of all things good and beautiful. Not just some object. She wasn't the cause of all her misfortunes. And everyone not just the prince sacrifices themselves for her. She is the dearly loved and treasured to everyone in her kingdom. The prince in this movie has a name and his name is Phillip.Phillip is lured towards Aurora by her spellbinding voice, which Fauna gifted her with. A little bit of help before anyone knew of what was to come. Once upon a Dream is a sum up of everything that happened before Aurora meets Phillip and everything after. '' I know you a walked with you once upon a dream, I know you the gleam in your eyes is so familiar a gleam''The three good fairies are female heroes. Instead of swords they wield wands. They brought up Aurora hoping it would save her from Maleficents wrath. They rescue Phillip and help slay her in the end.Aurora isn't overly passive. Her godmothers told her not to speak to strangers, yet she does when Phillip shows up. When she finds out about her true identity being a princess instead of a peasant and how shes betrothed to some prince. She panics. She doesn't want some prince, she wants Phillip. Pretty cool though how they were betrothed to be married, and then they find each other 16 years later and fall in love on their own terms. Aurora isn't going to defy the very people who raised and loved her all her life. So she simply goes with her godmothers to the Castle obediently. If she was truly overly lovesick, she would have just ran off or something. Prince Phillip does the most. He sacrifices his life to save his love. Hes such a man. As Aurora sleeps in the highest tower, her people sleep from the spell the three fairies put on them. Everyone wakes up only when there princess wakes up. How dark and romantic is that. Everyone loves her, and everyone suffers with her. lolThere's a lot of layers here in this movie. More then I can list. People mock the damsel in distress as if these poor girls could do anything about it. Give it another go without prejudice and you may just fall in love with this masterpiece.",Sleeping Beauty
165,Aeonar,"Ageless, Sleeping Beauty",9,18 September 2016,"One of the most famous (and beautiful) adaptations of the classic Grimm fairy tale, ""Sleeping Beauty"" remains a Disney masterpiece. Funny, romantic, scary and magical, this animated film creates an enchanting picture of Medieval Europe (probably Germany) that resembles the Gothic artistic movement, enriched with music inspired by Tchaikovsky's ballet. ""Sleeping Beauty"" touches themes such as love, hope and the perennial battle between the forces of Good and Evil. Although it is not similar to the latest Disney films that present independent, emancipated women, it is, nonetheless, an exciting artistic creation that has received a place among the films that comprise the Golden Age of the cinematic (animation) world.",Sleeping Beauty

It for me comes joint first with Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1936) and heres why.Apart from the amazing scenery and beautiful bewitching score, like all of Disney films, its the voices of the actors that made the characters come alive. Maleficent (voiced by Elanor Audley) was terrifying. Everywhere on the internet this is said. She wins online competitions all the time for being the most frightening, and she is. In fact, so scary at times (much more when I was small) that I would simply have to watch her, like I was scared yet had to see what happened.

Today I'm not so obsessed with it, but ""Sleeping Beuaty"" still holds a special place in my heart.There are several reasons as to why I love this film. One is the animation. The whole picture is practically a medieval tapestry come to life. Another reason is the music; Thcovsky's score is truly a marvel to listen to. And the last reason is *possible spoiler* the film's villain:Maleficent! Once you see this Sorceress in action you will truly appreciate a well done villain.

Just some weeks ago, I watched this movie for first time in like, 3-4 years? I always loved this movie, but this time I was stunned on how good it really is. Not only did it surprise me how great the movie is, but it made me watch many other Disney movies and realize how great they also are.Probably everything about this movie is excellent, especially Maleficent. She used to frighten me as a little kid (in a positive way) and she still is. The movie is combined with all things I usually want in a Disney movie; romance, adventure, humor and singing. One song from this movie I especially love is ""Once Upon A Dream"", it's my favorite Disney song along with ""A Whole New World"" from Aladdin.The reason I didn't give this 10/10 is that 10 always means perfect, and there really is no perfect movie out there today. Even though this movie is a masterpiece, there's some things I have to criticize. First off, Aurora should been more on-screen in my opinion.

The music is suitable for every scene, and they really got it when they decided to use Tchaickovsky´s ballet for ""Sleeping Beauty"". A great adaptation. The script really gets it. That careful use of words, that magnificent lyrics are inmortal. But hey... it´s the villain who steals the show! I tell you that Maleficent is the most remembered character of the whole movie, even more than Aurora/Briar Rose. Such coldness, elegance and wickedness is something quite unforgettable. The animation and surrounding is also incredible. Such a different kind of characters, such a greatness in the use of color and in the surrounds...

Aurora's voice doesn't fit the character; Mary Costa has a lovely voice but it's too mature for a supposed 16 year old character. The music sounds like it's being played in a tin can. It lacks the depth and beauty of other Disney movies. The story line doesn't flow; it's choppy, at best. The colors chosen are bland; they're not as vivid as the other movies.

I found the three fairies Merryweather, Flora, and Fauna to be dry and uninteresting (they take up a good half of the movie and laughably are supposed to be the comic relief). The friendship between Sleeping Beauty and the animals felt too forced - doesn't Disney have any other way to convey a gentle and friendly persona? The one joke which made me smile was the pink-blue debacle. But for its 75 minute runtime, a few seconds of genuine entertainment was not worth it.The only aspect of this movie which constantly impressed me was the animation, which is fluid and beautiful. Clyde Geronimi did a wonderful job with that. However, other than animation, I find nothing to recommend of this movie.

The problem with all new Disney films is they will never be classics. They are modern day stories aimed at merchandising. Merchandising was not the main objective in this film. It was all about bringing smiles and scarred faces to kids all over the world. To put them in that world and tramatize them for life with the evil Malifacent. NOW THATS COOOL!!! She didn't have the annoying old ladies choir voice that Snow White did. A major improvement. The animation was so fluid and had it's own style. 24 frames a second as apposed to now days 9 frames. Yuck! The colors were amazing in this film. They also found ways to make the scenery and backdrops move. The music will always be amazing. Never again will we see an animated classic like this one.

To make it worse, Maleficent has knocked Phillip's shield out of his hand. It looks like Maleficent is going to win as she laughs a triumphant cackle, but Phillip, with the help of the fairies, throws the sword like a javelin right at the dragon's heart, which kills her.

180,Vaklu,The Queen of Animated Movies,10,11 September 2013,"I haven't seen this movie since I was kid. A random pic I've found on the net from the movie though reminded me of it and I was curious how I'll enjoy it after so many years passed so I got a copy of it and sit down to watch it. What I had to realize is that not only I enjoy it as much as I did back then but I'm actually enjoying it even more. The movies biggest advantage is simply this: It's unbelievably gorgeous!The music, the backgrounds, the colors, the character animation, everything. Its as if every single scene in this movie was created with the explicit purpose to be as aesthetically pleasing as possible. Its art style I think is very special. Instead of the cartoonish look they went for realism. Upon the extremely detailed backgrounds we get extremely detailed characters who(especially Aurora and Malificent) make even the otherwise impressive looking characters of other Disney movies look like Powerpuff Girls. On the other hand the movie is also stylized to resemble medieval art which gives the movie a very unique atmosphere I think. The medieval style isn't only applicable to the art however. The songs and even some of the dialog I think were written in a way to make you feel as if you were listening to some kind of bardic story told through music and poetic language rather than watching a movie.On top of this the movie also has a very unique dreamlike quality. Its kinda hard to explain but this is what really made me fall in love with it(twice now). I'll try to explain it: On one hand they went for realism but they also made these surreal magical effects produced by the four fairies sorcery( or three fairies and one witch, I was never quite sure). Now the thing is that the transition from realistic to surreal is very subtle and the two elements end up bleeding together producing the dreamlike atmosphere. This is also true with the light and dark duality. The good fairies and Aurora represent good, light, joy, innocence and things like that with their design, colors, sound effects, voices and magical effects while Malificent is representing dark, dread, sorrow, violence and you know all the dark stuff again with her design, colors, sound effects, voice, and magical effects. And the thing is that all of this is bleeding and mixing together too so we not only have a dreamlike movie but also a bittersweet and dreamlike movie which resembles a bardic tale with musical and poetic elements stylized to resemble medieval art. All that in a single movie!Now here is the part where I'd talk about the music but IMO thats kinda unnecessary. Its Tchaikovsky. Enjoy it. Paired with these visuals that's the only thing you can do. I really like the songs too again partly because they feel right for the setting. My favorites are ""I wonder"" and ""Once upon a dream"" because I think Auroras/Marys heavenly voice is very hard to top. I really wish they gave her more songs.Now I read some opinions about it that criticizes things like characters and story. No. Simply no. This movie isn't about that! If you try to logic your way through it you are completely missing the point. What this movie tries to do is retelling one of the most basic fantasy stories you can think of using its impressive audiovisual tools and symbolism. It doesn't try to make you think it tries to make you feel. You know like pieces of art used to do. Odyssey or Hamlet or the picture about a naked woman standing on a giant seashell while being surrounded by flying humanoids don't make any sense either if you try to think about them too hard. Does this mean that they are worthless?So my advice is to try to appreciate this movie for what it is. Nothing is perfect but as far as animated movies go I think this one is the closest to it. So I hereby crown Sleeping Beauty as the Queen of Animated Movies with a perfect 10/10 score! You think its too high? Show me better!",Sleeping Beauty
181,ur48390693,Masterpiece.,10,1 June 2014,"Sleeping Beauty, from 1959, was the final fairy tale produced by Walt Disney himself and remains one of his studio's most under-cherished works. Suffused with celestial metaphors and flights of visual fancy informed by pre-Renaissance art, the film's economical story is played for cosmic pathos and staged as pagan ritual. Stylist Eyvind Earle and background artist Frank Armitage were more or less allowed autonomy over the production and their freedom is felt in the limber, giddy stylings of the film, a far superior work than its earlier kissing cousin Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Through the startlingly jagged animation and moving cutouts of the film, Earle and Armitage's crew of animators and painters evoke an expressionistic netherworld influenced by numerous Gothic, Persian and Medieval sources. The familiar story concerns a 16- year-old beauty, Princess Aurora, who dies when she pricks her finger on the needle of a spinning wheel and is subsequently revived by the Prince Charming she was destined to marry. In her attack against Aurora, the ferocious Maleficent (Eleanor Audley) appears to take on the fairy-tale cliché itself. After the story's three fairy godmothers bestow their cosmic gifts on the baby Aurora, Maleficent curses the child with death because she wasn't invited to her über-Christening. Her bitchery is of the highest order, seductive and titanic, and she is almost postmodern for her time. Just as the film's gorgeous backdrops suggest characters trapped in suspended animation, the many colorful balls of light that frequently circle their heads hauntingly convey the filmmakers' idea of fate and love locked in a cosmic struggle.",Sleeping Beauty
182,spellcasterkitten,THE FILES OF: Sleeping Beauty!,9,19 June 2005,"Sleeping Beauty definitely is a dark movie, but still has a cheery and airy feel to it. I remember when I was younger my parents didn't want me watching it because I might be scared.This wasn't my favorite Disney classic, but I do like it.I've chosen to base the fractured fairytale I'm writing on this movie.It's called THE FILES OF: Sleeping Beauty, email me if you want to read it! ^_^My personal favorite scene of Sleeping is the one where the three fairies are making the the dress, cleaning, and making the cake.I also like the scene at the end where the fairies keep changing the dress colors from pink to blue, go pink!!! XDI don't remember this movie very well, because I haven't watched it in some years, but I'd like to.(Love my spaces!)",Sleeping Beauty
183,rekocarreis,A cliché attempt at something magical,3,29 September 2015,"I chose to write a review of the Disney movie ""Sleeping Beauty"", as it is disturbingly different from its origin. It is an adaptation of the fairytale by Charles Perrault, ""The Beauty in the Sleeping Wood"". The Disney version of the fairytale begins with Princess Aurora as a child. Her parents promise that she will marry Prince Phillip of the neighboring kingdom in order to unite the families. They have three fairies come to bless and give gifts to Aurora. The first gift is that of beauty, and the second is that of a beautiful voice. Before the third can be given, Maleficent, the mistress of all evil, arrives and is angry that she was not invited to Aurora's christening. She curses Aurora and says that before the night of her sixteenth birthday, she will prick her finger on a spinning wheel and die. Luckily, the third fairy had not given her gift to Aurora, so the third fairy says that instead of Aurora dying, she will fall into a deep sleep. This is where the Disney adaptation and the original fairy tale go their separate ways. In the Disney version, Aurora is brought by her aunts (the three fairies) to live in safety until her sixteenth birthday. However, she still pricks her finger and is cast into a deep sleep. Prince Phillip fights Maleficent, who turns herself into a dragon, and rescues Aurora by awakening her with a kiss. This is very different from the original version.In the original, Aurora pricks her finger and falls into a deep sleep. One day, the Prince happens by her home and knocks on the door. No one answers, so he climbs in through a window. There he finds Aurora. He tries to wake her, but she is unconscious. So, oddly and disturbingly enough, he proceeds to rape her. Aurora awakens after giving birth to twins. One of her babies tries to find her breast, but finds her finger instead. The baby sucks the splinter from the spinning wheel out of her finger, and Aurora wakes to find that she has two children. This is alarming to me, because she simply accepts her children and does not question their origin or legitimacy. Prince Phillip is married, and murmurs the children's names and Aurora's name in his sleep. The queen is furious, understandably. However, though her anger is understandable, she reacts in a disturbing way. She orders the cook to find and boil the children, so that they can be fed to Prince Phillip. The cook does not comply, and instead cooks two lambs. The queen taunts Phillip after he eats the lamb and tells him that he has eaten his own children. After this, the queen creates a fire in order to burn Aurora alive. Prince Phillip manages to stop this from happening and orders that the queen be put to death. And, oddly enough, Prince Phillip and Princess Aurora fall in love and get married. The difference between the Disney version and the original version are astoundingly different. I've never cared much for the Disney movie, mostly because I found it boring and cliché, even as a child. Though, now knowing the original version of the story, I can see why the movie would come off as boring. Disney clearly had to remove huge portions of the story in order to make it colorful, glossy, and suitable for children. In my honest opinion, I think that Disney should have left this one alone. The movie is superficial and contains no real message. The bulk of the story had to be removed, and, though what was removed was alarming, it leaves behind a well-worn, lifeless attempt at something lighthearted and magical.",Sleeping Beauty
