0,nogodnomasters,Nothing like a good Danish,9,5 July 2020,"In the aftermath of the 2016 election, Democrats scramble to regain the Heartland with a local mayor election in Deerlaken, Wisconsin. Both parties pour money into this small campaign.If you liked the Jon Stewart of 2-12-2015 who blew up CNN""s Crossfire and got Tucker Carlson canned (he has stopped wearing bow ties to this day) You will love this film. Stewart criticism of the nation's polarization, blaming the media, blaming the whole political system comes to the screen. In the first 12 minutes, he lets you know what is right and what is wrong with the Democratic party. Loved the ending.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",Irresistible
1,kosmasp,Good/bad people on both sides,7,7 March 2021,"To be honest I might have issues to find really good people on one side. At least on the political aspects of the whole thing. And if you're honest, than the character portrayed by Byrne is effectively more evil overall. That being said, Steve Carrell also has a lot of moments, where he has to apologize.And the movie tells us how wrong the two party system is, it shows how it takes advantage of people and then spits them out once it is done with them And that is true with almost all politicians. I personally think someone like Bernie Sanders is different, but that is my personal opinion. And overall you should be able to enjoy this, no matter what political affiliation you have. And maybe even reflect on some things you believed were true and rearrange your opinion on those things or something else",Irresistible
2,classicsoncall,"""I look forward to lying to you in the future.""",7,10 December 2020,"Ah finally, the scammers get scammed, and the screwers get screwed! While hitting as many politically correct buttons as it can, the film offers a scathing indictment of our traditional political system and how money plays such an integral part of getting someone elected. That one scene of CNN's 'duodecabox' was so poignant; how many times have you watched a political panel where everyone talks at once and you can't tell what anyone is saying? Makes you want to change the channel right there. With perfect poise at the end of the story, Diana Hastings (Mackenzie Davis) looks political consultant Gary Zimmer (Steve Carell) right in the eye and tells him it wasn't personal. One of the best twists you could have expected in this story of consultants gone wild and spending the Benjamins like there was no tomorrow. Not that this is something that would ever happen for real. In that respect, the film calls to mind 2004's ""Welcome to Mooseport"", in which ex-President Gene Hackman runs for small town mayor against Ray Romano. That one's a little more on the humorous side with a host of well worn former TV celebrities. This one starts out shaping up to be a battle for the heart and soul of Deerlaken, Wisconsin, but quite cleverly results in the winner being the town's own citizens.",Irresistible
3,zardoz-13,Politics Roasted,10,7 September 2020,"If you hate politics, you'll love ""Irresistible."" Steve Carell, Rose Byrne, and Chris Cooper star in writer & director Jon Stewart's smart, sassy satire about politics and politicking in an obscure mayoral election. Entertaining from start to finish, this non-partisan comedy lives up to its title with surprises galore. Chris Cooper runs for mayor in the small, right wing Wisconsin town of Deerlaken. Basically, ""Irresistible"" is a fish out of water story about a political consultant from Washington, D.C., Gary Zimmer (Steve Carell), who catches a video of retired USMC Colonel Jack Hastings defying his hometown mayor and city council for turning their backs on the little people in the community. Zimmer envisages Colonel Jack as the ultimate Democratic candidate and drives to Deerlaken to persuade him to campaign for mayor. Hastings commits to the challenge, and Zimmer's clever but cute nemesis Faith (Rose Byrne of ""Bridesmaids"") shows up to orchestrate the incumbent's campaign. Half of the fun of watching ""Irresistible"" is the bickering between Carell and Rose Byrne. Whether you're either a Democrat or a Republican, it doesn't matter, because ""Irresistible"" isn't just another 'election movie.' The gags, the barbs, and the hilarity lighten up Stewart's indictment of our revenue-fueled elections.",Irresistible
4,ferguson-6,Jon Stewart speaks,6,26 June 2020,"Greetings again from the darkness. For the fifteen plus years Jon Stewart hosted ""The Daily Show"", he could be depended on to bring his acerbic wit and often scathing political commentary to virtually every show. His most devoted followers leaned left, though he was known to take down extremists on both ends. Stewart's foray into filmmaking as writer-director was ROSEWATER (2014), a look at the detainment and interrogation of journalist Maziar Bahari in an Iranian prison. This follow-up takes a much lighter approach - one similar to his TV days - while still managing to skewer our election system and campaign financing.Steve Carell spent a brief time as a reporter/correspondent on ""The Daily Show"" before heading off to mega-stardom in movies and on TV. Here he plays Gary Zimmer, a political strategist for the Democratic Party. The film opens on the 2016 Presidential campaign between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, and we first see Zimmer in a whirlwind media battle of words against his nemesis, Faith Brewster (played by a funny but underutilized Rose Byrne), a strategist for the Republicans. As you might imagine, Zimmer is a funk after the election, and his career is in shambles.A ray of hope and inspiration enters Zimmer's life in the form of a viral YouTube video. Wisconsin farmer and former Marine Jack Hastings (the great Chris Cooper) is recorded tearing into the Deerlaken Mayor and City Council. Zimmer recognizes the Patriotism and a potential Party savior, and seizes on the opportunity to convince Hastings that the Democrats stand for the same things he stands for ... those things he rattled off in the video.Zimmer in Deerlaken is the proverbial fish-out-of-water, and his trip is farmed for laughs. It starts in the local German beer hall and carries forward to Hastings' farm where Zimmer spots daughter Diana Hastings (Mackenzie Davis) up to her elbow in cow. The other locals we get to know include Will Sasso and Will McLaughlin as Big Mike and Little Mike, CJ Wilson as the accommodating barkeep, Blair Sams as the eager baker, and Brent Sexton as Republican Mayor Braun. When Zimmer's campaign for Hastings catches the eye of Ms. Brewster, we soon experience an all-out political brawl for the Mayor's job in this tiny town ... one recently made smaller by the closing of the local military base. Director Stewart labels this ""Heartland USA.""Of course, this isn't a story about the candidates. It's Stewart's commentary on how campaigns are conducted today. Social media and the national news media are weapons, and we see that there's no such thing as dirty politics ... only politics. Topher Grace plays a pollster and Natasha Lyonne is in charge of analytics, and the over-dependence on data is made clear. However, the biggest point Stewart makes has to do with campaign finance and money. It's all about the 'Benjamins.' The Super PAC is shoved (conveniently) to the back of the room in what Stewart terms ""an election economy.""There are plenty of Jon Stewart comedic touches on display. We get ""Rhinestone Cowboy"" used a couple of times, see ""swing voters"" listed on a first name basis, and get an advertising slogan of ""a redder kind of blue."" When Faith Brewster says ""I look forward to lying to you in the future"", we recognize this as prime form Stewart. The problem with political statements, political commentary, and political satire, is that people will complain it goes too far, or doesn't go far enough, or points the finger, or doesn't point the finger. It won't cover what they want covered in a way they want it covered. Stewart lets neither party off here. In fact, he lays blame on both. However, given what we see and live through on a daily basis right now, Stewart's observations come across a bit tame ... we wish he had pushed harder.The opening credits segment is brilliant with a slide show of previous campaigns accompanied by Bob Seger's ""Still the Same"", and the closing credits are worth sticking around for just to hear Trevor Potter, the former Chairman of Federal Election Commission.",Irresistible
5,deloudelouvain,Politics? Boring. The election campaign? Even more boring.,4,15 July 2020,"I'm not going to lie, I hate politics. To me they're all opportunists that want to make a lot of money. It's not about helping people, it's about making money. To me they should do it for free, as an ideal, but that will never happen. This movie is about elections, or the preparing of elections, even more boring, certainly as it's in the USA, where the elections are just a big show. A show that makes me vomit. I like Steve Carell in The Office for example, but in this movie I found him quite annoying to watch. Maybe this movie will speak more to Americans, that are used to this election crap, but as an European I find it stunningly boring. Try to get to donate one dollar from an European voter here, see what happens, you won't get enough to buy a bread, that's what we think about this whole mascarade Americans love so much. Irrsistible is a movie for imbeciles, not even a funny one except one or two scenes.",Irresistible
6,FeastMode,this could have been awesome,5,24 April 2021,"For the most part this was a mediocre movie, mildly amusing with occasional laughs. But also some pretty awkward moments.

Unfortunately the rest of the movie couldn't keep me invested enough for it to really hit.

7,Edvis-1997,7,7,26 December 2020,"At first I was thinking what kind of movie it's going to be, because Steve Carell is amazing actor in both comedy and serious movies(I hate watching trailers, I let film to surprise me by itself). After all, it was a serious movie with some sarcasm and comedy scenes which I liked. Main plot was interesting, I loved that they didn't speak a lot about Donald Trump or others politicians(as 90% films do). It surprised me in a good, ending was really unpredictable,film name had deep meaning, it's just good movie for a night. I would really recommend to watch it. Top 10 movies of 2020 for me so far.",Irresistible
8,Cineanalyst,Suckering the Spectator,2,11 February 2021,"This is insultingly backwards. The con film is a delicate balance of inviting the audience to be thrilled by being fooled. Much like the illusion of movies in general. Politics, on the other hand, is a blustering mess of making fools. Very much of a real life. Jon Stewart, directing ""Irresistible,"" whatever that title means, used to be quite good at inviting the audience to laugh at those political fools. Here, however, the movie identifies with the political class--particularly the protagonist Democratic operator played by Steve Carell. This is done through the standard, boring movie practices of the spectator identification with the viewpoint of the camera and, through that, the camera with the perspective of the protagonist. Nothing original in itself, but ironically, we don't identify with the inhabitants of the jerkwater Wisconsin town that is the on-screen audience to the political spectacle descending from D.C.It's as crass a dichotomy as was deft Stewart's humor on ""The Daily Show"" and his televised takedown of a hack on CNN's ""Crossfire."" The result of the twist here being at the audiences', which presumably include some of the idealized salt-of-the-earth types depicted by Hollywood actors here, expense. The implication being that we're the culpable fools. Some of the jokes here may be funny and regardless of the nobility of the political message intended, this is just staggeringly incompetent filmmaking.",Irresistible
9,UniqueParticle,Exceptional political comedy/drama,8,7 February 2021,"Steve Carell is so handsome and lovable in this great film by Jon Stewart! The comedy is spot on quite well written dialogue. Excellent for a political story not taking it self too seriously, Irresistible deserves higher ratings! Gary cooper still does a superb acting job even at his age which is impressive. I love the cozy small town style to everything. Ironically too I watched Will Sasso in a Law and Order: SVU episode earlier in the day.",Irresistible
10,cruise01,Wasted talent and concept in a unfunny political satire.,4,2 September 2020,Irresistable (2 out of 5 stars).Irresistable is a bad comedy political film about a democratic rep Gary (Steve Carrell) trying to help Jack ( Chris Cooper) become mayor in a small town in Wisconsin. While Faith (Rose Byrne) is trying to help a republican candidate against them. The plot does have a satire theme about elections. Money. And how two political parties are facing each other and gain a lot of money while nothing ever changes.The direction and script is kind of boring and unfunny. A great talented cast. Especially with Steve Carrell and Rose Byrne. But it was all a waste. The plot could have been better. There was a twist that supports the satire theme.

13,paul-allaer,Who is fooling whom exactly?,6,5 July 2020,"""Irresistible"" (2020 release; 102 min.) brings the story of Gary Zimmer, a Democratic political strategist. As the movie opens, the 2016 elections are happening, and Zimmer is in the ""Spin Room"" to explain what is happening, just as Faith Brewster is doing likewise for the Republicans. ""I am lying"" exclaims Zimmer, as does Brewster. We then go ""Rural America, Heartland USA"", and in a city counsel meeting in (fictional) Deerlaken, Wisconsin, retired Marine Colonel (and now farmer) Jack Hastings assails city council for cutting funding to immigrants, just as they need it most. Hastings' speech goes viral and before we know it, the DNC sends Zimmer to Wisconsin to recruit Hastings to run for mayor... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you';; just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the second film from writer-director Jon Stewart (yes, THAT Jon Stewart), whose previous film was the excellent ""Rosewater"". Here he brings us a political parable/satire about the polarization of ""red"" and ""blue"" states, and how both the GOP and Democrats are trying to take advantage of that. The first half of the movie flows generally speaking quite well, as we observe Zimmer being a fish out of water in Wisconsin, and Hastings eagerly accepting the invitation/challenge to run for mayor as a Democrat. Steve Carell (as Zimmer) and Chris Cooper (as Hastings) are excellent in the lead performances. Rose Byrne (as the GOP political strategist) is equally note-worthy. Last but not least there is Mackenzie Davis (as Hastings' daughter). In the last half hour of the movie, things take a very different turn, making me wonder who is fooling whom here exactly? I wasn't all that excited when it became clear what exactly happened.""Irresistible"" is in the end credits titled ""IrRESISTible"". The movie recently opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The theater followed all DCD COVID-19 guidelines to the letter, and added temperature taking before anyone was allowed in the theater. The Saturday early evening where I saw this at was attended okay (15 people in a theater for 120 people). If you have any interest in politics or in Jon Stewart, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Irresistible

Carrell is great fun as the expert who transforms Copper's chances, with Byrne, a little bit too cliche as his opponent. There are some truly hilarious scenes eg nuns being targeted and gaining the support of a near to death billionaire are high points.

18,masonfisk,POLITICS AS A SHELL GAME...!,9,18 April 2021,"From last year, we have the latest from writer/director Jon Stewart (Rosewater) which deals w/a Democratic political operative, played by Steve Carrell, who gets excited (after Hillary's loss) to see a true blue, dyed in the wool (maybe) Democrat (he hasn't announced his affiliation) farmer berating the town elders for a proposed new voter ID law via a viral video. Carrell hurries to the farmer's homestead, played by Oscar winner Chris Cooper, to convince him to join the Donkey party & run for mayor, abetted by his daughter, played by Mackenzie Davis, which is a tough slog since Carrell has to create a mechanism from the ground up & his Republican rival, in the form of Rose Bryne, has also hit the town to back the incumbent mayor setting up a humorous back & forth between each party to turn the tide of the town's politics. Stewart, as a former host of the Daily Show, wisely knows of what he speaks of setting up his backstage antics to expose the hypocrisy inherent in both parties when it comes to funding & superpacs. Carrell & Bryne come off as the villains of the piece (in a nice bipartisan way!) w/the town smartly doing things for themselves. Also starring Natasha Lyonne & Topher Grace as members of Carrell's team, Will Sasso as a townsperson, Brent Sexton (who I remember from Justified) as the mayor & Bill Irwin as an eccentric billionaire in a mech suit.",Irresistible

Politics, especially politics that aren't yours, and fictional politics doubly so, are not entertaining. There supposed to be a serious attempt at managing how our levels of government are run.As this movie highlights, certain avenues of politics are just big gang wars, mostly financial, with everyone trying to do whatever they can to get whatever they can, whether it is ethical or not.The people that do what happens in this movie in real life either see it as a war, or a sadistic game, which is where the barest amount of entertainment appears in this movie.It's star-crossed lovers trying to hurt one another in the most complicated and costly way possible.The good story is the one they hide from you, and it's next to impossible to enjoy it with the ""A"" story in the way.Just don't bother unless you're a HUGE Steve Correll fan or a big political comedy movie fan.",Irresistible
20,martimusross,I Didn't Laugh Once,4,13 November 2020,"IrresistibleIt was so laboured and so over-acted I just hated it, I did not laugh and I just could not see anything redeeming about this drivel.",Irresistible
21,maurice_yacowar,biting satire on American political system,8,6 July 2020,"It's a two-word title. With a shift in colour writer-director Jon Stewart isolates the ""resist"" in ""irresistible."" If the larger word suggests resignation the inner one calls for action, for reform.
The epilogue identifies both the narrative's central target - the huge amount of money both spent on election campaigns and open to misappropriation and abuse - and a call for a radical transformation of America's electoral system. It's broken, every which way, as off-screen Stewart's brief interview with a federal official affirms.
The film's opening sets the national context: Donald Trump's 2016 surprise defeat of Hilary Clinton. The plot sends Democrat organizer Gary Zimmer to a small Wisconsin town to use a mayoralty race to launch a local hero in the party's cause. Both parties pour huge bucks and tech resources into the minor election, afraid to lose a potential toehold.
If the plot seems outlandish, wait. It's a funhouse version of the 2017 special election for Georgia's 6th congressional district, where the two parties and supporting groups blew over $55 million - without the happy ending here.
The local tragedy and several jokes reflect the current national situation. Certainly the town's crumbling from the loss of its main industry speaks for the nation of small (and large) towns under duress. Both Zimmer and GOP spinner Faith blatantly confess the falsity of the spin-room. In an echo of the Trump lying streak, when Faith bald-faced claims to be from that small town Zimmer caves: ""She said it. Now it's true."" CNN and Fox News both come in for satiric slams.
But the main drive is the exposure of the system. As Zimmer meets the small town the characters are played as the rubes and hicks we've come to expect from the urban pundits. But here the country mice turn the tables on the city mouse.
When the joke turns out to be on Zimmer it's also on us. Spoiler alert: they've been playing him, exploiting the political system to con big buck donations to save their town. Justice happens but only through a surprise deception and the locals' exploitation of the Washington (and hence our) dismissive prejudices and false assumption of superiority.
Why, the two roughnecks even know the diff between a simile and a metaphor! Is no prejudice sacred?
As we expect of Stewart, he inclines away from the Trump party and administration. But he also hasn't lost his larger understanding that the problem goes beyond the parties, to the system's abdication of American values and fairness. As Stewart views the nation's paralysis, waste and dysfunction he utters this plague upon both their houses.",Irresistible
22,Rob-O-Cop,"Unfunny, Unlikeable American comedy on display till the last 10 mins",6,21 August 2020,"This was a fairly unfunny 'comedy' delivering a predictable plastic set up we've seen a million times before. Carell's character was misjudged in many places. He was unpleasant, while being unfunny. Prime example was his facial reaction to seeing Diana with her hand up a cow. He could have played it low key with a look of confusion but went for the clown face retching disgust reaction and that was how most of the jokes were played. big, obvious, insulting to the intelligence and a little disappointing.
Which is sad because the last ten mins of the film had some real depth to it, too bad the journey to get there was so mediocre. I kind of expected more from Stewart because his Daily show material was delivered with real heart and insight but, not here, and not with this material. His strength was shown in the final 10 mins inc credit roll. Like they saved all the cleverness for the end, and someone else rote the bulk of the front end of this. It seems to be typical of US entertainment and general persona these days, just unaware of how they're coming across and what they're doing.",Irresistible

Having Steve Carell and Rose Byrne as the two political enemies you can not expect the movie to be serious; however after a lot of dirty tricks on both sides, things turn out unexpected and you realize this is not a critic to the parties but to the political system in this country.
Directed by Jon Stewart with the complicity of many periodist from Fox, CNN and MSNBC all playing serious but basically mocking themselves and the absurdity of the media
Do not expect big laughs; the movie is very funny considering is really a critic to a corrupt system. Stewart keeps the ridiculous situations as realistic as possible; and in the very unexpected ending; the smarts are outsmarted.

24,Sir_AmirSyarif,A rather toothless critique of the modern American political process,6,23 February 2021,"Jon Stewart's 'Irresistible' is a critique of the modern American political process but it is rather toothless. The plot is rich but it only skims the surface of the problems but does not address any of it. It has some clever moments, wits, and twists. But, as a whole, it is forgettable, you wont remember or care to remember a thing after finishing the movie. The humor, in general, is too broad and feels flat. Steve Carell delivers a steadily funny and wholesome performance, while the underutilized Rose Byrne portrays the evil and seductive strategist perfectly.",Irresistible
25,kjproulx,"Interesting and Funny at Times, but Underwhelming",5,9 July 2020,"Off the bat, I'll admit that I'm not all that much of a political person, even though I do follow the biggest news stories that come out of it. For that reason alone, movies that revolve around them are hard to impress me. It truly does take some great writing to engage me in the story they're telling. In the case of Irresistible, it really came down to the fact that the cast worked really well together because I found this movie to be otherwise dull, even though there are some very solid moments of storytelling. While I can't exactly recommend this movie to everyone, here's why I believe some viewers may like it a lot more.Following Democrat Gary Zimmer (Steve Carell) as he is tasked with helping Conservative Jack Hastings (Chris Cooper) realize that he truly speaks like a Democrat and that he should change his viewpoints, Irresistible plays out as a drama, that thinks it's a comedy and falls somewhere in the middle. I personally didn't find the movie itself all that funny, but Carell brings his A-Game here and his subtle humor lept off the screen. If the character of Gary Zimmer wasn't so adamant about getting his way, this movie would've fallen flat on its face. This entire film relies on the fact that he needs to accomplish his goals. Not only Carell, but the rest of the cast shines as well, which I'm positive came down to the fact that John Stewart was at the helm as director.Admittedly, I have not watched 2014s Rosewater, also directed by Stewart, so this was my first experience with him behind the lens. Just from watching this film, I can see that he has a knack for working with actors. Being an actor himself, he has absolutely picked up some knowledge. I feel that's the case with the majority of actors who take a turn as a director, after a long career of watching how it all goes down. In many ways, even though this story is based on actual events, it really did feel like an independent voice being heard, with Stewart both writing and directing.Now, here's where my review may seem a little muddled. As I said, I'm not big into politics, but even I was finding myself wondering how a story like this from the pst had any relevance at all in today's climate. The story itself makes for a few interesting or funny scenes and the conclusion was actually quite enjoyable, but the journey throughout just felt like a slow, meandering look at the lower end of the political scene. That wasn't enough to keep me engaged, so I was found myself looking for the comedic chops in every performer on-screen, which definitely held the movie together for me.In the end, this is a film that would've been so much better with a spin on this true story that related to today's politics a little more. From Steve Carell to Rose Byrne, this cast is a great one and they do the best with what they are given, but the comedy that's trying to break through this slow-moving film just felt off to me. Where the story begins and ends had me interested, but as I said, it meanders far too much. Irresistible could've been a better film with some adjustments, but I do feel that fans of these actors or fans of a political feud between come characters might find a little more enjoyment out of this one than I did. Not a terrible movie by any means, but kind of a dull experience, especially when looking at it as a comedy.",Irresistible
26,msbreviews,"Irresistible has a bold and clever idea, but only fifteen minutes before its end.",5,28 June 2020,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)If someone asks me what I would entirely remove from the world to make it a better place, my answer would either be politics or religion. Both are necessary in their own way, but all I see is lies, corruption, racism, war, death, and so on. Therefore, I'm not a fan of political movies, even when these are meant to be satires or just a light-hearted flick for families to enjoy. That said, I really liked Jon Stewart's talk show, and Steve Carell is one of those actors who's always able to make me laugh no matter what. So, I decided to give this one a go...I have very mixed feelings, but probably not the ones most people will share with one another. Being from Portugal (an European country with a wholly different process of election) and having close to zero interest in politics, I struggled with completely understanding America's way of campaigning and voting, which is kind of one of the points the film eventually makes: the system isn't the best one. Ironically, one of the best parts is somewhat connected to one of my major issues. The last fifteen to twenty minutes play out a genuinely smart idea, even if it's logically ludicrous, but it made me want the entire film to explore it.From the very beginning until the start of these last few minutes, it's a pretty straightforward political-comedy with nothing being remotely unique or groundbreaking. I didn't even chuckle at most of the jokes, and when I did, it was more due to the actor's performance than the joke on itself. Irresistible follows a formulaic cycle of events, where Democrats and Republicans constantly get the upper hand on each other with an extra move after the other. Honestly, it gets tiresome and dull at a certain point.This is how those last minutes that I addressed above relate to this issue: I wish that the movie had explored that final idea instead of saving it for a plot twist that was far from mind-blowing. Yes, it's an entirely unrealistic idea in the sense that it's impossible for it to actually happen without someone screwing it up. However, I rather have a film with a bold yet nonsensical concept boasting a really impactful message than saving this portion to be the ending of a cheesy, cliche, unfunny, and not that entertaining political satire.Honestly, without the extraordinary cast, Irresistible would have been a total disaster. Steve Carell, as expected, carries the whole thing to safe harbor. I always loved his mannerisms and expressions, even when some people find them over-the-top or unnecessary. I just can't not like one of his performances. He perfectly captures the ""man from the capital"" persona, someone who doesn't know how to deal with the hospitality of Rural America or how to talk to Deerlaken's people or even what to order at a bar.Chris Cooper delivers a phenomenal display as Jack Hastings, the Democrat's candidate. His will to save his town and his love for everyone who lives in it takes him through the crooked path of politics, but without ever giving up on what he truly believes in. He doesn't want to lie, he doesn't want to play like everyone else plays, he just wants to be himself. Mackenzie Davis returns to her good performances (loved in Terminator: Dark Fate, but The Turning was a terrible mistake in her career), by playing the not-that-innocent daughter, Diana Hastings.Finally, I like Rose Byrne, but her character's relationship with Gary Zimmer is also one of my biggest problems with the movie. They're the most annoying part of it all. Extremely cliche, not funny at all, and the dialogues become so exaggeratedly improvised. Their banter continuously unbalances the tone. This type of toxic yet sexy relationship has been seen so many times now that it genuinely becomes incredibly irritating. Jon Stewart clearly needs some notes so that next time, he knows how to distinguish a feature film from a talk show's sketch.Irresistible owns a bold, intelligent idea that despite being unrealistically absurd, it carries an impactful message that I'd love to have seen explored in a deeper level, and not just in the last fifteen minutes. Jon Stewart's movie is at its best when making subtle little jokes about important real-life themes like racism, immigration, gun violence, political corruption, and more, showing the audience how some people foolishly react in certain situations. However, if it weren't for an outstanding Steve Carell and an exceptional cast, this film would have been a trainwreck. With a formulaic narrative lacking effective humor and unique characterization, Irresistible struggles to be remotely entertaining. It also features such a cliche, annoying relationship between two characters that made me roll my eyes and sigh way too often. A comedy that barely makes me chuckle about an activity I sincerely hate... It didn't work for me, but if you enjoy this subgenre, go for it. It's still far from being an awful movie.Rating: C",Irresistible
27,0w0,A solid 6/10 non-comedy drama film...,6,28 June 2020,"If you judge this movie by the trailer, then you'll think that this movie is a laugh-a-minute comedy film about a mayoral race... what this movie ACTUALLY is, is a drama about the workings that drive an election... It's not a comedy, as I only laughed once in the whole movie, so don't expect it to be funny...The concept/story of the movie IS interesting though, I have to say... the execution of it though could absolutely have been done better. Around 1hour into the movie, the story derails and takes a huge detour which was done for comedic effect, yet resulted in absolutely no laughs... and when the movie resumes its original course again, you're just left sitting there and asking: ""WTF was that? Was that really necessary?"".Overall it's a 5/10 movie, with an 8/10 concept, and if it was executed better, then it could easily have been a 8/10 movie simply because of how good the concept is. So I wouldn't really recommend that you watch the movie, unless you're just looking for a 2hour drama to keep your eyeballs occupied for a while... and like I said, don't expect any laughs since you'll only get 1 or 2.",Irresistible

Maybe it was primarily the writing. I don't think Stewart wrote this, but I really found a lot of the dialog just plain painful. And, this may just be a personal thing on my part, but what the hell is up with someone stuffing their face every 3 minutes...? Is that so important to the story? Is that something we really want to see? I don't know... I'm truly at a loss to explain it. I really LOVE a good political comedy / satire, and I was especially in the mood for one after what we all have been through right about now. BUT... I'm sorry.

It's been a while since the film industry made a political film relevant to the times we live in. I do agree that ""Irresistible"" had some holes here and there, but for the most part I was entertained. Steve Carell delivers a steadily funny and wholesome performance, while Rose Byrne portrays the evil and seductive strategist perfectly. The political subjects brought on by writer / director Jon Stewart could've been more predominant and clear, but his quirky script and interesting characters make up for the flaws.

I got to watch this NAU !And so i did.Irresistible, with Steve Carell, whom i loved in The Big Short, and Mackenzie Davis as Hot Girl. Also Rose Byrne is in a small portion of the film.In rural Minnesota, a viral video emerges of a good'ol , star-spangled marine/farmer/war veteran arguing with the evil local councilman, and Democrat campaign manager Gary Zimmer (Carell) decides to make him his poster boy for a gubernatorial run with the end goal of flipping the state.He descends on the sleepy midwestern town to find it's beyond quaint, giving him additional challenges to his scheme. Also present shortly thereafter is his offscreen nemesis, the pretty-darn-good Byrne playing the part of the devil-incarnate Republican campaign manager. They rush to the polls, unaware that a big surprise waits for them.I thought i would love this film, and instead i didn't love it at all.First off, Carrell here is much less focused .. tbh i don't like Steve Carrell at all, i was surprised at his performance in The Big Short, but here he's back to acting skills of The Office.He's supposed to be a sly, experienced, cynical and thoroughly successful campaign manager, but the film goes out of its way to at the same time paint him as an idiot.The film is overly long, slow, badly paced, and constantly veers between comedy and biting satire, without settling into either camp.The other character with the most screentime, the Colonel Sgt Major Terminator Jack ""America"" Hastings, starts as a fierce, fire-driven person whom we want more of, but immediately becomes a timid, incompetent hick, and loses any charisma he could have had.TONS of minor characters have 1-2 minutes at most and they are also all the same ""what is a teevee?"" character.Byrne is so good in the part of the evil witch that it almost grates against how mediocre everything else is.Spoilers below***********after 1 1/2 hours into the film, the ultimate insult; SHAZAM!

37,RhapsodyReviews,Too Political With No Laughs,6,7 July 2020,"Review:
'Irresistible' is a political comedy film written and directed by Jon Stewart. It follows a Democratic strategist (Steve Carell) who tries to help a local candidate (Chris Cooper) win an election in a small right-wing town.
Honestly, without the cast, this movie may have been a total disaster. Steve Carell, as expected, carries the whole thing to safe harbor. I always loved his mannerisms and expressions, even when some people find them over-the-top or unnecessary. Chris Cooper delivers a phenomenal display as Jack Hastings, the Democrat's candidate and Mackenzie Davis returns to her good performance, by playing the not-that-innocent daughter, Diana Hastings. However, I felt like Rose Byrne was trying too hard, ad it didn't feel as natural as it did with the other actors. I do enjoy het comedic presence is films, this one just felt off to me.
From the very beginning until the start of these last few minutes, it's a pretty straightforward political comedy with nothing being remotely unique or ground-breaking. I didn't even chuckle at most of the jokes, and when I did, it was more due to the actor's performance than the joke on itself. Now, the ending was nearly perfect. I won't give anything away, but when the ending of this movie started to get rolling, I was sold, and I thought it was brilliant and ballsy of Jon Stewart. Then they extended it for five extra minutes to try and get some last-minute laughs in and it felt flat. If those extra minutes had been scrapped, I would have loved this ending and it would have made the movie a whole lot better.
Overall, it is your run of the mill comedy film, and sometimes the laughs don't hit they their supposed to, but I still had a good time watching it. If you like Steve Carell, you will get enjoyment out of this movie, but if you're a take him or leave him kind of person, I would say not to worry about this one.

40,lotekguy-1,amusing NON-partisan indictment of our electoral process,8,26 June 2020,"Those who expect Jon Stewart's political comedy to be a left-wing screed will be either disappointed or relieved. This satire is truly as ""fair and balanced"" as certain others deceptively claim to be. It's a gutshot to our entire electoral system, showing both sides of The Aisle to be equally guilty, guilty, guilty.Steve Carell stars as a seasoned Democratic political strategist who finds a viral You Tube clip of a small town man (Chris Cooper) in Wisconsin, making a stirring speech for the rights of others in a city hall meeting, opposing the pompous mayor and his council.. He learns that the folksy, yet eloquent fellow is a veteran and farmer, which is just what his party needs to start winning back blue-collar and rural Midwestern voters. He knows The Party and Cooper have matching values and beliefs, even though the town and state have been voting Republican.Carell, a city guy who's (often hilariously) out of his element when trying to fit it there, rushes to the town to convince Cooper to run for mayor, breaking the Republicans' lock on the area and state. He wants Cooper to become the new face of the party. Cooper reluctantly agrees. A Republican operative (Rose Byrne), who's Carell's counterpart and frequent nemesis, sees the threat Cooper poses to their hold on that part of the base, and storms in with her minions to help the mayor keep his seat. Both parties smell a potential national impact from this minor race, and start pouring huge dollars into the fray, cranking up all the donors and tactics usually reserved for bigger stages. Both sides seem comparably desperate, and completely out of touch with the locals they're trying to woo.This film has all the wit and cynicism of political satires akin to 1997's brilliant Wag the Dog, or earlier efforts from A Face in the Crowd and Manchurian Candidate on the dramatic side to comedies like Bulworth and Primary Colors. Both sides court a demographic group they little understand. Both are classic fish out of water who take far too long to realize how misguided their entire approach to elections has become. Various tactics either seem to work only in the short run, or backfire - sometimes spectacularly.The wisdom of those ""regular people"" is greater than the Beltway Insiders understand. The clever plot delivers laughs, poignancy and a genuinely satisfying resolution. We meet a town of good people, not a bunch of rubes to be bought or manipulated by outsiders. Everyone grows wiser and more understanding of others by the end. We can all learn while we laugh at an extremely timely tale like this.",Irresistible

42,plasticanimalz,Very Resistible,5,12 September 2020,"When we'd seen the original trailer we were underwhelmed. Then when it skipped the theaters and went to iTunes there was a new trailer that looked funny. We thought, this could be a trick, and it didn't test well and so the studio did a new trailer to entice us, or the original was just a bad trailer. It was a trick. This is not really a comedy and I wouldn't as go as far to call it a dramedy, either.The casting is great and it's well acted. The directing is okay, I'll give Jon Stewart that, but the script is bad. Simply, he doesn't know how to write one. You have to wonder why most celebrities aren't required to do an assortment of short films before making a film, or go through some form of film school, as it's a lot of money to give to people who don't know what they're doing. There is a thin sliver of a plot, there's zero sub plot, zero character arc, basically, it's just a bunch of stuff happening with a bunch of people. You don't like Steve Carell's character because he's a huge jerk throughout the entire film, and you don't get to know anyone else in the film well enough to care about them, since it's mostly focused on Carell, who isn't an anti-hero either. He's just a smug guy who cares about his job and winning, and has some weird thing going with Rose Byrne, who is actually the only entertaining part of the film.Really, if you watch 5 minutes of the film just to know what it's about, fast forward and watch the end, that's all that's really necessary. The end was good. It didn't make up for the first hour and twenty-five minutes, or however long it was, and it didn't really make the film any better, but it had a good ending. I get the feeling Jon Stewart came up with the idea for the end and sat down and wrote a generic script about people, and an equally generic script about basic insider look at politics. I'm sure he thought, somehow because he's Jon Stewart, this would make the script great. And maybe that's your answer about why the hero of the film is so smug. It seems that if Jon Stewart took his idea and gave it to Adam McKay, maybe this could have been good. Adam is one of the few I've seen that can take an intellectual topic and not make it sound like Hollywood's rudimentary version of it.Maybe Stewart should focus on directing and give up writing. Take an acting class, because if not for using great actors in this film, that probably would have been a mess too. At the very least, get a competent writing partner to take his ideas and make them interesting, likable, and work. The end and set up was interesting and I could see how it could have worked, it just didn't. There needed to be a better script and someone on set asking obvious questions like: don't farmers work 16 hour days? Why would he want or have time to become a mayor? Why did Debra Messing suddenly disappear and she's replaced by a Natasha Lyon look-a-like? If Steve Carell is such a big politico who can afford to fly around in jets, how does he have time to focus on one future mayor in a town of 5,000, which will make absolutely no difference in actual polling?

51,Criticalstaff,It's Stewart but not peak Stewart.,6,19 July 2020,"This movie is not bad, but it is disappointing. Maybe most importantly because it is John Stewart's movie and it stars Steve Carell. Both of them, once upon a time, made some of the best political satire ever with the Daily Show and Stewart himself has remained one of the best political commentators. Just watch any of the promo interviews for this movie.That is why the movie is not as satisfying. The movie operates on two arguments that are very dear to Stewart: the monopoly of the right on patriotism, and the fear of the left to re-appropriate it; and the lack of transparency of Super PACs.The start of the movie leans heavily on that dynamic, patriotism and rural America. Those are the themes that the candidate represents and that is basically the only reason he is so ""irresistible"" to Carell. The second part of the movie is the political campaign proper and is an opportunity for Stewart to do what he does best: show how the sausage is made. For laughs.Yet, in my view, the movie undercuts itself with the third act. The Super PAC element is introduced way too late in the narrative, but it becomes the overarching theme of the movie. The film structure is what works against it. All the other elements of satire are dwarfed. Patriotism, the forgotten middle-class heartland, the craziness of the political machine where both parties tries to one-up each other, the over-reliance on polls and data, political consultants that are cynically more interested in playing the game than fixing the issues, all those things the movie establishes are downplayed by the events in third act.Which brings me to the crux of the problem: it is a critique of the modern American political process but it is rather toothless. The plot is rich but it only skims the surface of the problems, it does not address any of it. Which leads to another aspect is that the movie ignores the platforms, and I assume it did for appeasement. Which leaves us with the movie arguing that the problem of modern politics is not the ideas, the stances or the people involved, but it is merely the process, the ads, the tactics.
The after-credits were better at this than the movie itself.The second problem that did not bother me as much is that the film equates the right and the left. Both sides are equally bad. Which is a type of reductionism that is not worthy of some like Stewart. The right lies on live TV, the left is too woke for its own good, look! Aren't they both bad?If you want the divide between Heartland, USA and the rest of the country watch Promised Land. If you want a scathing look at political campaigns and playing the game for the sake of it watch Ides of March, or Veep.

Trevor Noah has that gig now known as ""The Daily Social Distancing Show"".
Even the Democrats admit in this movie their party is in ruins and needs new leadership.
Presidential nominee, Joe Biden, has already passed his used by date for Voters in real life.
It's a comedy starring Steve Carell who reins in his slapstick to deliver an adult performance.
He's no longer a 40 year old virgin.
Steve is DC Gary a top Democratic strategist and Spin Doctor.
Aussie spotters watch out for: Rose Byrne as Gary's arch nemesis, Faith Brewster, who is so low she even lies about being born in Deerlaken.
It's false news, but as we all know a lie told often enough becomes the truth, just ask Trump.
Together they put the tiny conservative mid west town on the map as retired war veteran, Colonel Jack Hastings (played by Chris Cooper) runs for Mayor.

Have you even really listened or been with campaign teams long enough? This campaign team, portraited in this film, is a copy of an image made by
""The media"" itself! The very organization they're criticizing for! As for CNN, again, the media, is also expressed in an image that has been built up by other places around broadcasting business. In what segment did CNN brought that many panels at once? The maximum number that they find ideal is two panels including one anchor or three panels just debating each other at the same time. Ah! Important mark here: Debate. No media, not CNN, not Fox, not ABC, not CBS asks for an opinion to their panels and let them answer at the SAME TIME! How stupid do you think we are here?! See, they're using a dirty tactic (That they think is the ""New low"") to condescendingly humiliate media and voting system? All of a sudden? Just say the strategies that campaign teams come up with. I mean, they don't even know what they're displeased at. What a sick joke this movie is.
Oh, I almost forgot. In the end, republican campaign team and FOX news comes out a little better than the other. This movie tries to be something else by putting spotlight on the people but WE, the actual people, have seen enough to realize what they did here. ""Shame! Shame! SHAME!!"" just as one of the most anticipated and yet ruined tv-series of all time says.",Irresistible

The movie is witty, it follows a bit of a formula to appeal to a crossover audience and it's a sincere, salt of the earth comedy (it's not a documentary, I think some of the harsh criticism suggests that people were expecting something over the top intellectually...but it's not a documentary). The story makes the points Jon wanted to make, the messages come across, and the end is poignant. It's good, it's silly, it's smart, it's salty, it's truthful.

And everything that could possibly go wrong does so; an embarrassing, utter failure.That's what we've got here, folks. I went to turn it off after only half an hour, but I am killing time waiting for a shop to open, so I made till there were but 20 minutes left and I could no longer stand it. I am far more enjoying watching my cat sleep.I read many glowing reviews here before deciding to watch the movie, so my expectations were high. But they were dashed very, very shortly after this utterly humourless disaster started.Carell is at his waaaaay-over-the-top worst from his first line and only gets worse, to the point that he is utterly unwatchable.I found a few good moments from the great Chris Cooper, but even when you think he is going to make a serious statement, he just nods off thanks to Stewart's inept, incoherent script and amateur direction.Over an hour and I didn't feel or care for anyone or anything, and just kept hoping it would get better, but its vital statistics demanded that I pull the plug on it.How this got made is beyond me, unless Stewart paid for it himself to have total control. No respectable studio - or HBO or Amazon and their kin - would have allowed this to be released in the state it's in.I am saddened that the first film to come out in a long time in the middle of a pandemic is barely a film, but more a series of disjointed, simply awful sketches.2020 marks Federico Fellini's centennial.

The main character Gary (Carell) is obnoxious beyond words and his republican counterpart Faith (Rose Byrne) is if possible even worse. The story centers around a mayoral election that gets overrun by national politics and thankfully the people of the small rural town Gary goes to ""help"" are charming. Aside from the juxtaposition of small town life with Washington politicking that is jarring we have the comedic exaggerations of the media that are often hilarious and remind us that John Stewart is the director.

69,organicsocial,Perfect heist movie for those who are disillusioned by the system,8,28 June 2020,"I give a solid 8 to Jon Stewart's directorial debut. Well its a reviewer's rating because I feel that anyone giving it their first shot should get some encouragement. From the perspective of a regular movie goer who want's something fun to watch, this movie is not Irresistible. Its a comedy but the humor is for the drab intellectuals who won't get a date easily. Surely I love it but then I loved ""Our Brand is Crisis"" too which was almost universally panned.Speaking of ""Our Brand is Crisis"", Irresistible has many parallels with that movie. Of course the chemistry of Steve Carell and Rose Byrne is way better than between Sandra Bullock and Billy Bob Thornton and this has to do with more of the political divide in USA than in some far off country. Truly, this movie is a testament to the issues of Democracy and the people who are both the victims and the benefactors of the dysfunction which comes from the apathy of those who win elections and the way the electoral system works now in America.This movie comes at a time that USA prepares to go into elections while the world grapples with Covid-19. The despise for Trump among the liberals is out in the open and the Republican Vs Democrat debate is raging. I would say this is the perfect time for this movie to come out but would people want to watch it? I would say you should. In essence its a classic heist movie and viewers only realise it at the end. This is about as much I would give out to the reader who hasn't watched the movie.One thing I would point out though is that Jon Stewart's keen observation of politics in America and his bipartisan view translates well on screen with this movie. He is right about the state of Democrats in America. Surely, not everything can be blamed on Republicans. There has been some inherent flaw in the way liberal ecosystem has depended on media management and outright lies to control the system for years. Being from the PR background myself, I see the truth about the unsavory tactics and the kind of toxic people in the industry serving those in the power. Irresistible is just a funny anecdotal evidence of the cesspool which really exists.Watch out for the mid credit scenes.",Irresistible
70,clarkishome,IRRESISTIBLY SO TRUE!!! 🌈,6,27 June 2020,"The story was well written and conceived. The acting was mediocre too good at best. What I really liked about this movie is that it showed how screwed up our elections and everything to do with them is manipulated by the media, individuals, and politicians. The idea of super PACs there's a giant black hole that could be manipulated at will.

72,tomarm-21596,Turning this off early proved Irresistible,3,15 February 2021,"I got barely half way through, before turning it off. Saw nothing remotely interesting or humorous, just tedious cliches. No idea why Carrel's supposed hot shot DC political guy wanted to get involved in a Wisconsin mayoral race, and soon just didn't care why. Chris Cooper's character spouting liberal bromides is supposed to make him some ideal candidate by virtue the addition of his military persona. But he just seems too boring to have any appeal politically - or as a movie character - and as soon as you see the actor's soft looking pot belly, you don't believe the tough Marine warrior part.I never found Jon Stewart funny or interesting, but I suspect that even those who did like his snarky liberal take on the news, will similarly find he just has no talent for being a writer/director of movies",Irresistible

74,helghast-1337,"Surprisingly good and very middle of the ground, politically speaking",10,27 June 2020,"First, I don't particularly like Steve Carell as an actor so I was reluctant to watch this film, but on a boring Friday night I decided, after a few drinks, to give it a shot. The acting is well done, the story is surprisingly original (from what I've seen), and overall just a good flow of a movie that never felt boring despite what reviewers say and my personal feelings towards Steve.If I had to sum it up in one thought it would be this: politicians (nationally, e.g. governors, senators, et al.(also, note that I did not pick a side)) are disconnected from the the Americans that don't live in metropolises. This film exposes that, in my opinion, in a very unbiased way while making fun of both sides of the aisle.A good film to watch that has some cringe-worthy moments, but for the most part is a good story and lets us laugh a little bit at the calamity of politics prior to the most important election year in this countries history.",Irresistible
75,aigoalies,"A couple funny parts with glaring plotholes, leading to more of a message than an actually good movie",4,28 June 2020,"Basically this movie is supposed to teach us a message by telling us that political parties and the media are corrupt in the election process and just try to use people. First off, many people are saying this film is completely unbiased, which is not true, it takes many subtle jabs at Trump; it does, however, criticize both parties. The comedic part of the movie was pretty non existent for me, I only laughed at the google and siri joke at the beginning of the film. The plot is also filled with tons of holes. I know the democratic party was trying to get rural voters, but why would they ever pour that much money into a small town, why would steve carell, a big shot, ever agree to personally help with this small town mayor's campaign, why would the republican party lash back so heavily. There are many other plot holes that you could easily deduce for yourself if you look over the movie's plot. The worst hole in the script is the fact that in the end we are supposed to just forgive and applaud the daughter for lying to Steve Carell the whole time to steal millions of dollars. Somehow literally stealing from someone is justified, because democrats and republicans fight too hard with each other to win votes. The end is hilarious as well and not in the way they intended, it has to be the cheesiest thing I have ever seen: daughter elected as honorary president, steve carell and rose end up together because they made one sexual joke and were enemies the whole time? In the end because of the plot falling apart and the fact that the comedy is non existent, this movie comes across as more of a blatant message to viewers than a well done movie with a subtle message inside.4/10 for google joke and the acting",Irresistible
76,Lemos,Funny and enlightening moments - but in the end all a bit of a cop-out,6,22 January 2021,"Jon Stewart presents ... the Jon Stewart political light philosophy.
Great at pointing out the sheer ridiculousness of today's politics and certain aspects of the electoral system with some very funny, entertaining, satirical moments and dialogue. The final message is the price of this win-at-all-costs attitude plus the sheer wastefulness of the political game, mainly in America, but not exclusively in America anymore.
Ultimately it hopes we can all collaborate and come together in peace and harmony across the ideological political divide.
The sad cop-out is most folks with any ounce of fairness, decency and respect know this should really be the final outcome but ironically Jon Stewart is none the wiser in showing us mere mortals how we can genuinely change the rules and achieve this - unless we all come up with a devious and cunning plan to cleverly scam money from all political party's donations kitty bag.

80,josephbrewster-88279,Wins by a narrow majority,6,25 July 2020,"Cute, poignant, with occasional moments of heart-warming relatability, this is mostly a feel-good comedy about a broken political system. The characterizations of the politicians is intentionally over-the-top in contrast to the lovable hometown folks, who are what really sell the script.It's not a masterpiece, but it's worth the price of admission if you're willing to forgive the unnecessary raunch and ridiculous caricatures of the two lead politicians. Especially Faith Brewster, who seems unredeemably immoral and corrupt from the beginning, as the conservative, against the sometimes endearing, sometimes jarringly rude character of Gary, the liberal. If you accept that the whole town is traditionally republican, and all relatively nice people, then we can consider this bipartisan, but Faith's character was the hardest for me to handle, and her interactions with Gary were so crass and sexual, it was a turn-off.Spoiler warning:
The final act, in which we find out the town collectively conspired to use the system to milk a super PAC for the funds needed to survive is rewarding, but ultimately feels a bit unbelievable, so don't think too hard about it or it won't make sense.On the whole, it points out some interesting idiosyncrasies about the American political system which I found entertaining and educational, while still hitting a few high mora-of-the-story moments that cuddle that inner patriot we all want to believe in: the good hearted, honest, hard working people who's vote might make a difference in the grand parade of political capitalism.",Irresistible
81,didomenicosam,For lovers of Behind the scenes of campaigns,8,24 February 2021,"John Stewart again exposes the ease of how American politics can so easily be corrupted. Definitely a funny movie perhaps not as funny as, 'the campaign' with Will Farrells slapstick style of comedy but a more subtle humor using real smarts and real life strategies. Without giving away anything the movie is basically an eye-opener to how corrupt the American political system of campaigning can be.

88,Grey_rainbow,The movie is below average for something involving Jon Stewart and Steve Carrel.,6,3 July 2020,"Irresistible is a political satire with two main messages- (1) The current election system is a terrible one and needs a reboot and (2) There is not a big difference between political parties except that one says bald-faced lies on screen (which is a genius political trick). The veteran mayor candidate and his daughter bore the heck out of everyone and the climax is a huge letdown.The story has some clever moments, wits, and twists. But, as a whole, movie is forgettable, you wont remember or care to remember a thing after finishing the movie. The key goal of a movie with an important timely message is that it should linger around in the audience's mind for a very long time. Irresistible fails miserably in achieving this. It does not even work as a one-timer comedy let alone scaling up to the expectations one would have, the minute Jon and Steve's names are mentioned.",Irresistible

I was so disappointed for Jon. Comedy is hard and I was trying to imagine how certain cringy scenes were decided and my guess is that when you're in a creation bubble you can sometimes be disconnected from the end result. It happened too often in this one unfortunately.I liked a few jokes and the scenario I guess. It does show the reality of political campaigns in the US and the very serious problems therein.

It does convey a lot of the dysfunctionality of American politics, but in the end it leaves us with nothing but cynicism. You find out at the end that the apparently genuine statements at the beginning by the candidate (which impressed me a great deal) were just a scheme to get money for the town. This film was made by John Stewart, and it doesn't do anything for my opinion of him. I'm not sure what he expected to accomplish by making such an extremely cynical film. Some of the reviews have said it is even-handed in making both parties look bad, but I'm sure this will do nothing to bring reconciliation to our country. The film makes it harder to believe that anyone tells the truth.I almost wonder if he intended to make a different film and wasn't allowed to. For awhile it seemed to be setting up a really inspiring story that was worth sitting through--it was really hard for me the whole way--and then I found out at the end that it wasn't worth my trouble.

The amount of dishonesty in the world is staggering. And whats most ironic, is that same dishonesty is what is at the heart of this movie. It's political satire lite. Tastes meh, not very filling. Stewart makes his points early on and the rest is cruise control comedy, rarely veering in either groundbreaking or darker directions. I would assume, knowing of Stewart from some early stand up and of course his influential place behind The Daily Show desk, that his personal philosophies would land in the liberal area of political discourse. But make no mistake, this isn't a love-letter to Democrats -- neither side comes out unscathed. There may be a more sympathetic lean in the Democrat's direction, but the majority of the film is aimed at the head shaking stupidity and gross bull$!ttery of the media machine and ""money as speech"" side of an election. As Faith muses about halfway through ""20$ says I do better with fear than you do with shame."" And that's it. The problem with the current state of politics, if it could be summed up in one sentence (which it can't but just go with me here for a second) is that it's a high stakes bet, billions on the line, trillions actually, and the only action is fear or shame.

Unfortunately, he's not much of a storyteller or a director; not only does he fall into middling themes and overwrought routines but he fails to keep the characters in character -- clearly he lets the cast settle on shtick rather than honest, nicely-carved characters. As we have seen with Space Force(TV Series 2020- ), Steve Carell is a competent serious and comic actor who can be self-deprecating and amusing in a non-Office-like environment. So, why does he impose ""Michael Scott"" shtick in his role here? Is this what the Writer/Director Stewart wanted? Seems like he went for a plan B. Some of these actors look like they have no direction and their characters are unnecessary; Chris Cooper appears stunned most of his screen time, Rose Byrne usually knows what she's doing but not here, and Mackenzie Davis looks out-of-place, like a role was created for her at the last moment.

Other than requiring a massive suspension of disbelief, it's a sweet film and I understand what he was trying to do overall. But the treatment of rural America was outdated and felt like something from Doc Hollywood; the party scene might as well have been from Crocodile Dundee; the problem is that those were original and funny. As has already been pointed out, there are massive plot holes, but the political and media establishments are parodied here, which is good and I'm all for it. But the overall story is basically absurd and the movie is, frankly, not funny. I'm pretty sure that wasn't intentional (please detect the sarcasm), and it's in spite of its incredible cast. Being neither a republican nor democrat myself, I hope Stewart keeps on this track and doesn't inject his personal politics into future projects, perhaps with more effectiveness than this piece. I just feel like being a multi-multi-millionaire and having been so entrenched in the Hollywood/D.C. machines for so long have skewed his perspectives and he may have trouble relating to most Americans.

insight into this twist earlier or with a longer post reveal, but it's a minor criticism. Jon Stewart's comedy is a hit for me but I could see how other just dislike political humor in general, possibly because they view it as a personal attack.

It perfectly encapsulates, in my opinion, how the Democrats and Republicans are out of touch with the people they serve but also don't actually care about helping them, as Diana Hastings (Mackenzie Davis) points out at the end. It's all just a show, like shadows dancing on a wall (thanks for the allegory Plato).From a non political perspective and just as guy with nothing better do on a Friday evening, the movie is definitely worth a watch. I had a good laugh watching it and the way Steve Carell and Rose Byrn's characters interact with the townsfolk, the environment and each other goes from ridiculous to cringy a few times (not that I expect anything better from a bunch of career politicians from DC).

What is absolutely remarkable, is that even though it goes right in the subjects of politics in general and voting in particular (and it is safe to assume, that in any movie production there will be more democrat voters than republicans) it is masterfully balanced. it does not flatter democrats and does not flatter republicans, not an inch. whoever you were going to vote for before watching this movie, is exactly who you will vote for after watching the movie. the movie has no agenda no propaganda elements.By being perfectly balanced (and boy, how refreshing that feels after watching virtually any news, none of which even attempts to be unbiased anymore) it does one wonderful thing. It doesn't make you a democrat or a republican, but I feel it does close that ever-growing gap that there is between the two groups, essentially a gap, that was artificially created between neighbours, colleagues and even family members. to me that was the real message of the movie, and it did sum it up very well in the closing lets say 10 mins.

If only we could come together for real change & make people & communities our priority. It did make me cry (even though it was sweet & funny) because it gave me HOPE.

It was ambiguous to the point of confusing. Carell and Byrne are always great together and were the only irresistible part of this schemozzle.

beautiful acting , really enjoyable movie , but to be honest it is not a 10 stars like i gave it , but i don't understand how it is at 6 now .it should be at least 7",Irresistible

174,khamara-67795,Different from my expectation,6,28 June 2020,"I thought this movie would be about shifting votes from Donald Trump to the democratic party propaganda.
But it turned out it was an insult to the election system of America.",Irresistible
175,zackszabo,A balanced and truthful affair.,10,27 June 2020,This points out some truths very unique to America and inspires the Conservatives to rate 1 star because of how real it was and how it causes them to face somthing they don't like to acknowledge.,Irresistible
176,sravanaerrolla,A scathing indictment of the absurd theater that is American politics,10,26 June 2020,"What a timely movie to bring people together & show them who the real bad guy is, the rotten system that has been driving people so far apart & making their differences so irreconcilable that they can't even come together in times like these & the people who down voted this movie with out even watching because they ""feel"" that this movie attacks them is a testament to how deep this schism has creeped into the hearts & minds of the people. It's a lovely little movie, do watch it.",Irresistible

179,joycepardon,"Enjoyable fun, feel-good film",9,27 June 2020,"Enjoyable, fun, feel good film. Full of Quirky fun small town characters. Well crafted. So refreshing to see a film about politics that takes no left or right Political side. Thank you!",Irresistible
180,adamd-29025,Clever lines delivered by clever writing,10,29 June 2020,"This is John Stewart and all the actors at their best. Knowledge of current events and the way the United States operates makes the movie even more hilarious.The low reviews are puzzling. The movie is precisely what the trailer portrayed.No love story, no comic book hero action sequences, no violence, no vampires, or werewolves --- probably why some folks did not like it, (or they are trying to skew the ratings).",Irresistible
181,johnws-90640,Totally Resistable!!,1,1 September 2020,"Worst movie I have seen in many years. Use of profanity and vulgar comments was not only overdone and unnecessary, but ruined the plot and overall scene of the movie. I won't be watching anymore Jon Stewart movies!!!",Irresistible
182,cbnactive,Has it all!,10,9 September 2020,"A warm wholesome Midwest town under siege. Enter: the political class desiring to be the answer to all their troubles. I don't want to spoil the movie, but it is full of twists and turns and the result was so very lovely in this time. I can't think of a character that was not cast and played brilliantly. While I'd admit that part of my love of this delightful movie is my dismay on the current divide in our country and how it runs as background noise in every single thing we hear and do, the end had me grinning for an entire day. And that is a rare thing for me to feel that way when I watch a movie nowadays. I just loved it and hope Jon Stewart continues to make movies. Kudos, sir!",Irresistible
183,kesemdv,I can't believe that Jon Stuart came up with the dumbest plot ever for a movie.,4,29 October 2020,"Plot is so dumb.

I want my wasted hour and a half back!",Irresistible
184,smileguycass,ALL POLITICAL PERSUASIONS MOVIE,10,14 February 2021,This movie is not about liberals trying to convert moderates or conservatives. It is a fun enjoyable light-hearted look at our political system. It should be an awakening to everyone that has a net worth less than 100 million which is all of us reading this. Watch it!!. it is entertaining . and a surprise ending to boot!!,Irresistible
185,gregguster,"Honest movie, regardless of politics.",10,4 March 2021,"Great view and truth on American politics. Whichever side you are on, this movie speaks volumes on why our system is broken. Hint, it is money.",Irresistible
186,hurricanesherri,Should be required viewing for every American!,10,18 July 2021,"Jon Stewart, you are truly a national treasure. This was such a great surprise of a film-- we just stumbled upon it on HBO-- and we felt it gave us an education on the inner workings of political campaigning that everyone should have. BRAVO!",Irresistible
187,hudinhom@netscape.net,What a waste of my time!,1,30 June 2020,"The film is so empty in all its assumptions and fantasies. The best thing is to watch a better film such as Wag the Dog, Bob Roberts, etc etc etc.",Irresistible

189,pujanz,A surprisingly wonderful movie,9,29 September 2020,"If you are not ideologically possessed by either parties or are not a political hack, then you will very likely love this movie. It lays out the corrupt games behind the scenes by both parties, and how normal citizens are paying for such appalling exercises at the end.
The movie was a balanced mix of witty moments and meaningful conversations, and a little twist at the end perfectly sealed the package. Thank you Jon, you didn't disappoint.",Irresistible
190,drdavid-150-610782,Frankly aghast at the negative reviews,10,19 April 2021,"This political satire is absolutely brilliant because of how spot on it is.I don't know if the reviewers who gave this negative reviews are clueless about how broken the election campaign is in the United States, if they are too shallow to see how brilliantly this movie depicts the dysfunction in completely nonpartisan ways, or if they are puppets of that broken system.What I do know is that, as the 12-award-winning culture psychologist who was named America's Integrity Expert by Radio-TV Interview Report, I passionately recommend that everyone in the United States who is high school age or older should make a priority of seeing Irresistible.",Irresistible

196,brooker_alison,"Great movie, really well written, directed and performed",9,26 June 2020,"People saying ""enough with the politics"" need to get their head out of the sand and start educating themselves about the world rather than moan about it! The world is political. That's life. This movie was so well written. The performances were near perfect. Such a witty and well informed view of life...just shows how educated and well rounded Jon Stewart really is. I laughed out loud many times and often because of extremely subtle lines. Loved it.",Irresistible

201,donflatt-43844,It just keeps getting better...,9,13 July 2020,"I loved this film! Sure, there are some uneven performances and uncomfortable moments and at some points this movie just seems a little too earnest. At other times there's a wonderful charm to the characters and a familiarity that's easy to relate to. As the film progresses, more and more of the problems with the electoral system are revealed. And the story is just plain fun. Stay for the credits, it's the ultimate kicker.",Irresistible
202,stevenhking,It was wonderful- bad ratings??,8,28 June 2020,"I don't understand the bad ratings. Jon Stewart made this movie, just look at it from that angle....if you didn't like the daily show when he was on it, ehhhhh this may not be for you. #JonForPresident",Irresistible
203,kkostova,A comedy that ends up deeper than you might have thought,8,6 November 2021,"The movie is pretty funny and ends up commenting on the voting system in USA. Althought a small town campaign is the main thema I would not say you must love politics to enjoy it. Good actors and a nice story. Not the typical romcom, with a nice twist at the end.",Irresistible
204,trippalamb,First class movie by Job Stewart,10,30 June 2020,"For some reason this seems to be a polarizing movie, but I feel like the people who don't like it miss the point. It was a movie about a political race made by Jon Stewart. Why are you surprised when it was political? Is it th best movie ever made? Of course not, but I think it was perfect for what it was intended to be. I highly recommend it.",Irresistible

Cheeseheads don't say ""y'all""! We don't sound like hillbillies. We're not a bunch of yokels.

206,midnight_oil-46652,Jon Stewart hits a massive Home Run,10,28 June 2020,"When it comes to comedies and horror, DO NOT allow bad reviews to dictate your choices. At the time of this writing, the film has a 6.1 IMDB rating. This movie is clearly not a 6. Ignore the bad reviews and definitely stay through the very interesting ending. Jon Stewart delivers a winner.",Irresistible
207,natecaminata,Don't listen to the critics,8,27 June 2020,"Stewart didn't set to do a vapid comedy on the cynicism of politics. We have VEEP for that. Instead, he made a thoughtful movie, well-acted, well-written, with strong character development, each strength attempting to convey to the audience two things: that we as a country can be better than we are right now, and that it's up to us, not career political hacks in DC and/or deep pocketed troglodytes, to make that happen.Watch this movie. Appreciate who we can be when we work together.",Irresistible
