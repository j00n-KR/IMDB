0,Leofwine_draca,Amiable enough,5,17 May 2020,"MY SPY is yet another in a long line of flicks featuring established action stars having to interact with precocious children in family comedies; add it to the list of KINDERGARTEN COP, MR. NANNY, THE PACIFIER, THE SPY NEXT DOOR et al. None of these add up to very much but generally prove amiable enough, and the same can be said of this film. Dave Bautista is a relatively new face in cinema, but he has a long wrestling career behind him, so in a sense he's been acting for decades. He tackles his role like a pro, and is inevitably the best thing in the movie. The rest is a mix of romantic comedy and general spy tropes, shoehorning a bunch of action into the mix. Some of the performances go way over the top and irritate, but it generally looks and feels breezy enough. I could have done without the silly slow motion effects though which every director unsure of the genre feels necessary to add to their movie.",My Spy
1,SnoopyStyle,uneven,6,18 April 2020,"JJ (Dave Bautista) is a hardened soldier struggling to be a good CIA spy. In the latest operation, he kills a lot of bad guys but loses the plutonium material. He is relegated to a secondary mission to spy on ER nurse Kate Newton. Her dead husband had a bomb design which could be used with the plutonium. He is joined by sycophant tech Bobbi Ault (Kristen Schaal). The CIA duo gets out spied by Kate's 9 year old daughter Sophie Newton (Chloe Coleman) who is getting bullied at school.I like the girl. I like Bautista. I like Kristen Schaal. There is some good fun but the comedy is inconsistent. I like the girl bossing Bautista around. The lie detector is fun. The steroid joke and the fish gag is funny. On the other hand, other jokes fall flat. I couldn't pinpoint it to the writing or Bautista's limitations. For example, the bird joke could be much funnier if Bautista doesn't notice what happens. He needs to be clueless in that moment. A big part has to be the writing. Director Peter Segal has done a few good comedies. It's the writing duo of Erich Hoeber and Jon Hoeber that has a questionable past. Their best seems to be the Red series but that brand of comedy only works with good comedic actors. Their other claims to fame are Battleship and The Meg. That's not a good sign. Overall, I like Bautista with the girl. I like him less with the other actors. I expected more with him and Schaal. It all leaves this movie with an uneven comedic effort.",My Spy
2,Prismark10,My Spy,4,29 May 2020,Ever since Arnold Schwarzenegger made Kindergarten Cop. Every tough guy actor needs to do at least one kiddie friendly movie.Dave Bautista goes family friendly as JJ. An ex Special Forces soldier now a CIA operative.JJ goes undercover with tech operator Bobbi (Kristen Schaal) to track the movement of the sister in law of French arms dealer Victor Marquez. His brother hid the plans for a miniaturized nuclear bomb that he intends to sell to a middle eastern terrorist.The dead brother's American wife Kate and their 9 year old daughter Sophie have moved back to America. The CIA suspect that Victor will come looking for the plans.Sophie quickly figures that JJ and Bobbi are spying on them and persuades JJ to do odd jobs for him. This includes going out ice skating and doing a talk in her class. Eventually Sophie tries to persuade JJ to date her mum with the gay neighbours doing a makeover for JJ.This is an amiable but lacklustre comedy action film that never amounts to anything other than average. The action gets bogged down with the domestics. Schaal is annoying. At least she points out which action film My Spy is ripping off.,My Spy
3,nogodnomasters,I did not see that coming,8,26 April 2020,"This is another adult/kid spy story. JJ (Dave Bautista) gets demoted and must work surveillance with technician Bobbi (Kristen Schaal). Bobbi admires JJ. They are spying on a single mom (Parisa Fitz-Henley) and her daughter (Chloe Coleman) who might be contacted by the bad guy. The nine-year-old blows their cover and wants a father figure and to learn the business. She manages to con JJ.This takes the stereo-type and presents it in a fresh manner. Kudos to Chloe Coleman and Kristen Schaal for bringing life to the script. I liked the Harrison Ford film reference.Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity.",My Spy
4,kosmasp,Spy living,7,29 January 2021,"Living la vida ... spy? Does one know anything else when one is only involved in a certain enviroment but also has no time for anything else? Wait this is not a psychological study. It also has things that people should not take too seriously (like walking off from an explosion looking cool ... and what one has to do to achieve just that ... you'll understand once you watch the movie - again, don't read too much into it or overthink it!).Dave Bautista - he really can carry a movie, in case you weren't sure! Seems like a cool and funny Dude in real life (and someone you shouldn't mess with - look at him! Just saying!) and a decent actor too. Of course this being a comedy it is not like he can stretch too many acting muscles (pun intended). Still his charisma is enough to carry this and with the supporting cast ... this is a winner! Very good casting job on the ""little"" girl too. Never easy to find a teenager, both charming and talented enough.Decent comedy, nothing more and nothing less",My Spy

Nothing at all original - it's got just about everything and everyone from evil mobsters to gay neighbours, and I am afraid to say that I found Chloe Coleman (the precocious, but ultimately really quite vulnerable (yuk!) 9 year old ""Sophie"") exasperating to the point that I would gladly have thrown a fully functioning toaster into her bath....

6,Calicodreamin,Cute!,7,12 December 2020,"A cute action comedy that hit all the notes. The cast had great chemistry and the comedy landed. The storyline was fairly predictable, but it didn't need to be more than it was. Truly enjoyable.",My Spy
7,DKosty123,Fun Formula Light Comedy,7,2 January 2021,"WWE and Marvel fans will recognize Dave Bautista who here is part of a CIA team keeping a watch on a family that is holding secrets the bad guys are after. While this is a bit formula, it has funny moments and is fun to watch. Let me try to summarize the plot.JJ and a CIA Tech. partner are assigned by CIA Boss David Kim (Ken Jeong) to watch single mom and little girl who are unknowing targets in espionage intrigue. The little girl wants to be a spy. JJ mistakenly gets involved with the little girl whose trying to control him and manipulate him into a relationship in her and her moms life.There is plenty of good humor to go around and the physical comedy is kind of predictable. It is a good formula comedy but the pacing and the cast are entertaining. While there is no way it is an outstanding film, it is a pleasant film which does make a few twists and turns that are flat out funny.Towards the end, JJ comes clean with the mom about why he is there, and then by coincidence the bad guys find them and try to get the secrets away from them. This is where JJ's tech does a classic Barney Fife (Don Knotts) type of thing with some of their guns to stop the bad guys. Then it all works out with a good ending. The CIA actually looks a little smarter at the end, unlike earlier in the film when they look a little bit bumbling.There is the neighboring gay couple who are not what they seem either. In fact when we find out by them, the explanation of who they are is funny and a bit confusing.",My Spy

9,Pjtaylor-96-138044,It's fine.,5,15 July 2020,"'My Spy (2020)' is an incredibly familiar and, as such, predictable picture that gets into its chalk-and-cheese central dynamic in a weird, borderline creepy way. Its protagonist is sent to spy on a target's wife but her young daughter soon discovers the cameras he has placed in every room of the house - yes, every room - and decides to blackmail him into accompanying her to 'special friends' day at school instead of immediately telling her mother or, indeed, removing any of the surveillance equipment. What follows is a fairly standard family comedy in which the pair grow to like one another and teach each other things such as how to tell a fool-proof lie or how to care for something other than your job. It's all very generic and, despite a couple of chuckle-worthy moments, relatively dull. At the same time, although there are some decidedly unfunny moments, the thing is never so bad as to offend in any real way. It isn't particularly boring. It's just utterly average, really. 5/10",My Spy

11,cruise01,"Cute, fun, and entertaining.",6,27 June 2020,My Spy (3 out of 5 stars).My Spy is a fair action comedy film about a CIA agent JJ (Dave Bautista) who surveillance on a lady and her daughter Sophie (Chloe Coleman). Until Sophie catches them and blackmails JJ to help train her to be like him.It is a cute fun story. But the story is predictable. The film begins with JJ undercover with a Russian mob in a warehouse that ends in a firefight and chases. JJ is awkward when it comes to being a people person. He attains Sophie bring a parent or friend to school. Going on ice skating. And falling for her mother.It can be cheesy. The action sequences is decent. It does have its fair share of laughs.

14,subxerogravity,Another movie I did not get to see in theatres (This one way have been worth it),7,26 June 2020,"I was looking forward to seeing this movie in theatres. Becoming a huge fan of Dave Bautista, The actor so I actually could not wait to see this family friendly picture.
It seems almost mandatory that a ex-wrestler needs to star in a family friendly movie , especially if Bautista wants an acting career as big as the Rock (who did Tooth Fairy) John Cena (Who just did Paying with Fire) or dare I say it...Hulk Hogan (Every movie he ever starred in).I won't spoiled the movie for you, because I don't have to. We've all seen this movie so many times that you already know the Spoiler Alert just by watching the trailer.Typical tough-as-nails action hero type being soften by his awkward interaction with a smart aleck little girl (it usually is a girl).I will say that Bautista does bring his own flavor to the formula and despite telling the same jokes over and over again, he's not bland. Plus his chemistry with the little girl is good. Makes it a feel good movie.It's also a fun movie. Lots of laughs and very exciting, just like a wrestling match, so it works that one of the best wrestlers in the biz is the star of it.",My Spy

16,alindsay-al,An Above Average Generic Film,6,12 May 2020,"So this was one of the films that was meant to come out around March time but due to the current pandemic could not, but now it is on Amazon so I have now watched My Spy and here is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees a CIA agent get caught on operation by a 9 year old girl so she makes him teach her how to be a spy.
Main Character
Dave Bautista is an actor who we have seen plenty of over the last few years and I think he has the potential to really be as important as The Rock for wrestlers turned actors as he is really good in this film. He is an obvious fit for an action star due to his size and when he is required for this it works but it is the funnier and sweeter scenes where he really shines. His scenes with Chloe Coleman are very heartwarming and I thought they had good chemistry together. Even though his character development is nothing suprising it works for him and he does a good job with the role.
Supporting Characters
As mentioned Chloe Coleman is the 9 year old girl and I thought she did a good job in the film, she actually comes across as a likeable character and her chemistry with Bautista is a real highlight for the film and obviously the relationship is the thing we are meant to most care about and unless you have a heart of stone you will do at least to some extent. I also think her mother in the film gave a good performance, her chemistry with Bautista is well handled and I thought she was just a good addition to the cast. But I didn't care about anybody else in the film, I get what they going for with the character of Bobbi but I found her annoying which made me struggle about her arc in the film and honestly it didn't feel important to say the least. Speaking of not important is the villain in this film who is one of the most generic bad guys in recent memory and he is a part of the film that really doesn't matter.
Story
The plot is enjoyable enough, it s really sweet to see the main characters bond and you care about their relationship and it is nice to see. But this films plot is really generic, if you read the premise of this movie you can predict every thing that will happen and it happens exactly that way which holds it back. Plus the villain plot just goes away for ages and you actually forget why these characters are in their places due to this.
Script
The script actually has a few good pop culture references that I thought worked mixed with a good bit of humour and a good bit of drama. It's just there isn't anything that really stands out and some of the drama doesn't really work as you know where the film is going so it feels like a waste of drama.
Style
One of the biggest compliments I can give to the film is that it knows what it is, it is a silly action comedy film and it really knows it and embraces it which is fun to watch and a bit cheesy but in the good ways. Though this film does have a bit of a pacing issue basically forgetting about the bad guy plot for the majority of the film. It also doesn't have very interesting action scenes and it isn't a highlight of the film.
Overall
Overall, this is a film where you get what you expect, it is entertaining and charming but there is nothing special about it and it won't be a film that you will remember much in the future. I would say it is more of a family film but could be worth a watch but don't rush to watch it.",My Spy
17,kwenchow,"Another worst film! Too many boring conversation, and overuse scene! The action scene also very messy and slow! Super letdown!",1,15 April 2020,"This film start with a CIA agent ""JJ"" killing a bunch of guy to secure the plutonium, and he having meeting with his superior ""David"" scene! As turnout, this film is about JJ need to spy on a mother and daughter(Sophie and Kate), to obtain the USB drive, contain the nuclear data! Because Sophie's uncle ""Marquez"" hidden the USB drive at her house! Entire film full of boring conversation, and overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the song playing at the background scene, overuse of the tripping scene, overuse of the playing dumb scene, and overuse of the disgusting dancing scene! Make the film unwatchable! The action scene also full of slow motion and messy! Barely laughable scene is, JJ's colleague ""Bobbi"" keep dropping the bullet while shooting at the bad guy! At the end, JJ fight with Marquez!

21,aidanratesmovies,Kindergarten Cop meets Spy Next Door,6,2 August 2020,"Entertaining, sweet, but cliche and formulaic- My Spy seems like a typical family film, but its biggest disappointment is that it could have been a lot more. The film seems to imitate a lot of previous action/family films of the same nature, namely Kindergarten Cop and The Spy Next Door. Dave Batista holds his own, but his acting can seem a bit lazy, as his character is more of an outline than anything profound. Nevertheless, it's not surprising to see such a thin set of characters throughout the film, as well as a rather thin script in general. The film is riddled with cliches, often a bit cheesy, and can be quite formulaic. However, somehow in the midst of all this, the film can be surprisingly enjoyable, and mainly, entertaining. The film may be predictable, but it does have its fair share of fun moments. The cast may not be anything special, but the chemistry between them make for an amusing time at the movies, and one film I didn't mind as much as I thought I would. In the end, My Spy is not anything special, but it does have its good moments, and can prove to be surprisingly decent.My Rating: 6.1/10.",My Spy
22,questl-18592,My Babysitting with Dave,7,10 January 2021,"My Spy is a super generic, by the numbers action comedy with a spy element tossed in. It's nothing new, there's no real originality here and it's not really trying for much either it doesn't seem like. It's competent and amusing, but it's not memorable. What has me bumping this up a little is the performances. Bautista is wonderful here, his personality and whole thing is just a lot of fun for me in a role like this. Him aside, Coleman does admirably as the child co-star and Schawlow is hilarious as well in her role.This isn't some huge comedy smash hit but if you're interested in something to toss on in the background that might deliver a chuckle here and there, this is a solid choice. Bautista brings a great energy to this that bumps it up a little but don't expect any game changers or revolutionary elements. It's a solid action comedy, nothing more and nothing less.",My Spy
23,rannynm,Love the friendship that develops between Dave Bautista and Chloe Coleman's characters,10,8 May 2020,"I thought My Spy was so good because I loved the friendship and love that develops between the characters JJ (Dave Bautista) and Sophie (Chloe Coleman)! They start off as strangers and then, throughout the movie, JJ teaches her how to be a good spy, and she teaches him how to be a kinder person as their relationship grows stronger and they become friends. Not only does JJ have a change of heart and but eventually he develops feelings for her mom.My Spy is the story of a CIA agent who is secretly watching a family in order to try and get information connected to a big case he is on. One of the people he is watching is the little girl, Sophie, who discovers J.J. and that he is spying on her and her mom. In exchange for not revealing his secret, Sophie makes him teach her how to be a good spy.One of my favorite parts of My Spy is when JJ goes on a date with Sophie's mom and starts dancing. Because his character is so serious and he's such a large person, it's very funny to see him trying to do all these trendy dances...because he does it so terribly! Honestly, it kind of reminded me of my dad dancing.For those who like Dave Bautista in Guardians of the Galaxy you will love him in this movie. Chloe Coleman has a very bright acting future-she is such a kind person both on and off camera, and she has such an amazing on-camera presence.A quick note to parents: My Spy does contain some adult language (and in some songs played during the movie.) So while younger kids may enjoy it, parents should decide if their kids are mature enough to see a movie with moments of profanity.My Spy is full of action, fun, comedy and love. I give My Spy 5 out of 5 stars. I recommend it for ages 10 to 18, and adults will love it too!Reviewed by Lindalee R., KIDS FIRST! REPORTER",My Spy
24,Kamurai25,Little bit for everyone,8,1 July 2020,"Great watch, will watch again, and can recommend.My favorite role of Kristen Schaal's ever, and it is arguable that she took a back sit to the amazing Chloe Coleman playing the world's sociopath with the best intentions.Dave Bautista has found a fun niche for himself in these action roles that require heart and nuance that only a handful of guys can handle. Honestly Vin Diesil was at the low end of it (honeslty, a compliment), and I can't think of another guy other than Dwayne Johnson to put in this camp.While you can look back at history and see Hulk Hogan, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and maybe Sylvester Stalone do rolls like this, their personal flares would have made this a very different movie. Batista really shows that he can do something other than be a muscled guy.The writing is consistent and well nuance, with a fantastic premise. It honestly took too long get to started though, the opening scene is cool, but nothing more than a hook to establish the situation.Dr. Ken Jeong makes an appearance and honestly, he just makes me happy he's there, even playing a straight man role.Seriously, there is a nice balance of rom-com and action here: there is something for everyone. This is a good stay in date night movie.",My Spy
25,Abdulxoxo,Fun derivative movie,7,29 January 2021,"Muscle-bound action movie star ends up in a comedy looking after a child/children; with the humour usually being seeing a huge tough guy outsmarted by a little kid. 'My Spy' is another one of those. But here's the thing, I kinda liked it. The story is extremely derivative. Pretty much everything that happens in this film you've seen done before. The big guy, the little girl, the attractive mum the big guy falls fall, the underappreciated geeky tech expert, the comedy tropes, the action tropes. There's nothing in this movie that was completely unique. Basically every character is a stereotype. You know as soon as you first meet them exactly who they are and how they'll be by the end of the film. The dialogue is often either clunky, cheesy or a combination of both. There is also a subplot involving a couple of neighbours that I could never figure out. They weren't funny and they're involvement in the plot was completely unnecessary. However, in spite of all issues this film has, I did enjoy watching it. I thought the acting was pretty solid all around. Bautista has been funnier in other films, but in terms of how this character was written, I found him really likable. Kristen Schaal was funny. Parisa Fitz-Henley was convincing in her unchallenging role of the single mom. But It was young Chloe Coleman however who impressed the most. As well as being adorable, her comic timing, reactions and facial expressions were all really good. She also seemed to work well alongside Bautista.Overall, I found this film to be funny. The gags are mostly simple and predictable, but perhaps because of the likability of all the characters I just relaxed into it and had fun. To be fair, some of the funniest moments in the film came when they played around with tropes. Often this film would play up to the standard comedy and action scenarios that we've seen a gazillion times before. However on a few occasions they set up as if there's going to be one of those tropes, only for what happens to actually reflect more of a real life outcome. So, for example, when our protagonist is in a car and there's a fence they need to get to the other side of, when they drive at the fence what happens is not what you'd expect, which is funny.",My Spy
26,martimusross,"Pure Entertainment, I laughed Out Loud!",6,2 April 2021,"My SpyThis was nothing more that a little bit of fluff, the jokes came thick and fast, and overall it was a jolly good romp.The characters were all so overacted it just cannot be judged on any acting level at all.

27,IonicBreezeMachine,Does just enough to elevate it's tried and true formula.,7,26 October 2020,"After a botched mission in Russia, CIA Agent JJ (Dave Bautista) along with tech analyst Bobbi (Kristen Schaal) are assigned to Chicago to monitor ER nurse Kate (Parisa Fitz-Henley) and her daughter Sophie (Chloe Coleman) who are the family of arms trafficker Victor Marquez (Greg Bryk). Sophie discovers JJ and Bobbi's surveillance activities and agrees to keep their secret in exchange for favors leading to complications.My Spy's premise is certainly a familiar one as it's cut from the same cloth as films like Kindergarten Cop, The Pacifier, and The Spy Next Door, movies that take action stars put them in domestic settings and watch the humor come from the ineptitude at using their action hero skillsets against rambunctious kids or household chores. My Spy is a cut above the rest thanks to a skilled cast, sure handed direction, and a screenplay that isn't afraid to have teeth.Dave Bautista since appearing as Drax in Guardians of the Galaxy has shown himself to be a fairly strong comedic actor with his deadpan delivery yielding some of the biggest laughs in those movies. I'm pleased to say that persona he's crafted is still very much allowed to shine through in this movie, even if it is occasionally forced to take a backseat to pratfalls and rambles (though they're approached with more restraint than this type of movie usually has). The movie is written by screenwriting brothers Jon and Erich Hoeber who gave us lesser efforts like Battleship and Whiteout, the pretty decent RED 1 and 2, and the average The Meg. In terms of quality My Spy ranks somewhere between The Meg and the RED movies with it's premise being familiar, but like Meg and RED the movie isn't afraid to mock itself for its premise and never takes itself too seriously.The majority of the action is kept at the beginning and the end of the movie, and what is there is surprisingly decent and thrilling (it definitely earns it's PG-13). The acting across the board is decent with Batista and Schaal having a good comedic dynamic (but unfortunately she's forced to take a back seat once the kid enters the plot), and there's also decent chemistry between Bautista and Fitz-Henley in the romantic scenes. Chloe Coleman does an okay job as Choloe, but the movie does fall into the trap of having her be one of those precocious children who talk like an adult and the movie does seem to be aware of it and even makes a few jibes at itself over it, but it doesn't make it any less of an obvious writing crutch.My Spy is pretty serviceable as far as entertainment goes. While it doesn't stray too far from the established formula, it does allow itself a bit more of an edge and takes its familiar premise into more daring territory.",My Spy
28,muamba_eats_toast,It's not terrible but it's not particugreat either,6,18 May 2020,I can count on one hand how many times I actually laughed out loud.

I can't recall the last time a film had so many release date switches. Now with the coronavirus pandemic which is absolutely ruining everything for everyone this has been switched to Amazon for release. After watching it, its not unlike anything we've seen before in terms of a film where a brute character befriends a kid. Its a good thing that My Spy was interesting enough to get by and is further proof that Batista works as a comedic lead.
The film is about a CIA agent who camps in an apartment building to monitor a mother and her young daughter's safety. Things go wrong and the agent is discovered by the kid. She bargains with him to use him for favors she needs and in return she will keep his identity secret. This also includes trying to romantically link the agent with her mother. However, he has to be careful not to comprise his mission and create a conflict of interest.
The film has problems in storyline and isn't very believable. A CIA agent falling for the target he is protecting? Not believable. I think Batista works in comedic films. I had a lot of fun with Stuber. This one has much less comedy. Its not always funny but it remains consistently entertaining. The plot issues especially when the main villain comes around make it predictable and messy but in a time where there are literally no new movies coming out I will take what I can get.
Overall, its a film where nothing new happens and is predictable. However, in a time of very little going on it works to kill time and further shows that Batista (much like other former professional wrestlers) might have a good time in the film industry. Its pretty unfortunate what happened with releasing this film. They should have just done it as early as possible.

Kristen Schaal cracks me up. Chloe Coleman is an adorable child. I have seen Chloe in other good TV streaming shows and I loved them in all. I first saw her in HBO's Big Little Lies with Nichole Kidman. I think she will have a long and successful career in show business. I would really like to see a sequel. Great job Amazon.,My Spy
32,markthomassintek,Same story again and again and again,5,20 March 2020,"REVIEW - MY SPYA spy and his tech partner get assigned to watch a mother and daughter because they may have information related to a neuclier device. That's the story out of the way (well sort of), unfortunately the spy gets involved with the daughter and then meets the mother and after 1 hour and 20 minutes of this finally the action begins for the last 10 minutes.Sorry to say but this film just got extremely boring very quickly as the story is very predictable, after reading the above you can probably guess most of it.Definitely not one for the grown ups to sit through while the kids start to fidget in their seats.Way too long, not very exciting and honestly nothing new, just the same story re hashed again and again and again.Rating 5 out of 10",My Spy

35,kjproulx,A Copy and Paste of Many Others,5,12 May 2020,"When it comes to films about an action star who has to look after a young child/family to prove himself, pretty much everything in the book has already been done. From The Pacifier to the Tooth Fairy, movies like this seem to come along when a new action star is on the rise. With Dave Bautista being in recent hits like Guardians of the Galaxy, Spectre, and his limited screentime in Blade Runner 2049, it was only a matter of time before he was given a role like this one. My Spy is absolutely everything you think it might be and nothing more. This movie takes zero risks in surprising its audience and for that reason alone, I just can't recommend it. Here's why this movie really isn't worth your time, but also why it may please a specific demographic.After royally screwing up a job and destroying any possible intel he could've garnered, JJ (Dave Bautista) is placed on surveillance of a mother and daughter. Having to watch over them while also becoming very involved with both the daughter and the mother, things get a little sticky for him. With that set-up, you can pretty much guess every single one of the ups and downs that a movie like this would have and It doesn't miss a mark on that front. Movies like this have the potential to break the formulaic curse, but this one just didn't have any original bones in it.I'll be honest and say that Dave Bautista isn't one of the world's greatest actors out there, but I will say that when he's given the right role or in the right direction, he can shine brightly. This movie felt like a mixture of the two, however, because it seemed like he was using his witty personality from Guardians of the Galaxy, but also being very laid back and subdued like he was in Blade Runner 2049. This made for a very lukewarm performance for me as he really didn't find a happy medium. Still, I've grown to like him as a performer over the last couple of years and his chemistry with young Chloe Coleman definitely saved the film for me.Much like my issues with how his character is, I feel that this movie was unsure of what it wanted to be. My biggest takeaway from this film was the fact that it clearly isn't meant for young children because there is some violence, but it's so tame that older kids may find it to be slightly childish. That's a hard line to walk with a movie like this and JJ's contrast from his day job to his time with Sophie felt like two completely different films throughout the first half of the movie. It felt more natural towards the end, but it was a little too late for me to be truly invested.In the end, this movie strives to please adults, action junkies, and children all at once and it never really hits that mark as a whole, nor does it feel like one coherent piece of filmmaking. With that said, Bautista and Coleman are great together and I've liked movies with this formula in the past, so it was at least watchable for me. The problem is that the entire film from start to finish feels like a copy and paste of many, many other movies. It's hard to recommend a movie that does that unless it presents something new worth seeing and I just don't think My Spy had that to offer. It may please kids around the age of ten, but I can't see this movie impressing much more than that.",My Spy

37,msbreviews,My Spy is exactly what it intended to be. But...,5,14 June 2020,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)One of the most delayed films in history, My Spy, finally premieres in my country this week. When a movie gets delayed so often, it usually has to do with production issues: studio change, cast and/or crew replacements, something that affects the film with reshoots, new edits, and who knows what else. It also serves as an indication that it might not be good at all. Why would someone change a movie if it doesn't have any significant flaws? Therefore, I didn't have big expectations for what seemed like a generic action-comedy flick starring Dave Bautista, who I love to watch as Drax (Guardians of the Galaxy), but I don't know how well he can carry a film as the protagonist.My Spy is surprisingly decent. I don't understand why it got delayed so much. It's a relatively innocent, inoffensive flick featuring two fantastic lead performances. Dave Bautista proves that he can handle being the protagonist of a movie. It took me a few minutes to get convinced by his display, but he gets better as time goes by. However, Chloe Coleman steals the spotlight as the young girl Bautista needs to take care of. With eleven-years-old, she's got more emotional range and comedic timing than a lot of grown-up actors. Excellent performance and great chemistry between the two!Parisa Fitz-Henley is also pretty good as Sophie's mother, Kate, while Kristen Schaal struggles a bit between being funny without getting annoying by portraying JJ's partner, Bobbi. The relationships between each character develop in a formulaic, cliche manner. There are no surprises throughout the whole runtime, character and story-wise, but that doesn't mean the viewer can't have fun with what Peter Segal ends up delivering.It's funny at times, it plays off of a few stereotypes regarding action flicks, and it doesn't overstay its welcome. It boasts a fast pace and a few exciting action sequences, so it has all the ingredients to be a fun, entertaining film. Nevertheless, it's far from being groundbreaking or special. Every single character is recycled from thousands of other movies, every plot point is just another take on something repeated throughout cinema's history, and technically it's as generic as it could be.Overall, I was ready to give this one a positive grade... but the film either fails to deliver closure on an issue regarding Sophie's school ""friends"", or it assumes that everything is fine by the end of the movie. Bullying is an extremely serious subject, and there are a lot of kids that struggle to fit in and make real friends. I don't want to spoil what the writers do with this side of Sophie's life, but it honestly doesn't send a nice message to young viewers and their parents. I choose to believe that they just forgot to tie that knot...My Spy is exactly what it intended to be, and it checks the four famous boxes: it's a cheesy, predictable, cliche, formulaic genre film that, while it doesn't bring anything remotely unique to the realm of movies, it's still fun to watch on a Sunday afternoon. Boasting two exceptional lead performances from Dave Bautista and Chloe Coleman, Peter Segal delivers an inoffensive action-comedy flick that doesn't take itself too seriously. It possesses some funny and entertaining scenes, but it's far from being an outstanding piece of cinema. Erich Hoeber and Jon Hoeber are not known for being creative and imaginative, so it's a matter of not having high expectations and enjoying it for what it is. The reason I'm not giving this one a positive grade is due to the lack of closure given to a significant issue regarding Coleman's character arc, which sends the wrong message to everyone (kids and parents) going through the same problem. I still recommend it as a fun movie to watch at home with friends and/or family. Just don't expect too much from it.Rating: C+",My Spy
38,SoumikBanerjee25,A Casual Feel-Good Film!,6,3 November 2020,"""My Spy"" might not be remembered much long for what it tries to be. Apparently it's quite cliched & generic in its fervent efforts; But that didn't bother me from having a good time. Not At All!
Dave Bautista is such an amiable presence on-screen.
Having seen him flourishing over the years as an actor; is indeed a delightful experience.
I must acknowledge Chloe Coleman too.
Her chemistry with Dave was heart-warming.
I did enjoy both of their performances here!
Feasibly the single utmost reason for my positive impression of it.Articulating about the other aspects, technically it's an Action-Comedy; and it does live upto its name quite a bit. With astutely placed humour & adequate action pieces; this one unquestionably had a honorable showing.Although, I wish some things were different!I simply hated the brewing romance between JJ & Kate, it seemed forceful and honestly didn't add upto anything major as per the plot is concerned. In the contrary, it affects the overall pacing. Especially in the second act.
The antagonist, our 'Bad Guy' and the usual ""Secret Plans & Stuff"" didn't have much of an impact.
Though the humour was well evaluated, on the Action front; I got way less than I anticipated! Even with someone like Dave in the cast, if you ask me; that's a bummer.",My Spy
39,bshaef,Uggggggg,1,30 June 2020,I'd rather watch paint dry than a formulaic rehash like this. I give an ok for most of the actors but and F for the storyline.,My Spy
40,cardsrock,Pretty much what you'd expect,6,4 July 2020,"I probably would give this a lower rating if not for Dave Bautista's continued acting improvement. He is quickly becoming the best wrestler-turned-actor in Hollywood. He is charismatic throughout and carries most of this predictable, but sweet family film.",My Spy
41,rdoubleoc,"Like Married to the Mob, but with a twist.",10,26 June 2020,"I give it a 10 just for how watchable and entertaining this is. I think a lot of people won't even realize how much they like this movie, even after they're done watching it.The plot is like Married to the Mob, but with a kid, and a little twist (blackmail from the kid).They probably put a lot of thought into this movie, but I mean this in a good way -- it's very funny most of the way through, and the punchlines hit pretty hard sometimes.",My Spy
42,trinaboice,Cute and entertaining,8,12 March 2020,"IN A NUTSHELL:
A massive, burly spy and a precocious, adorable 4th grader. Sounds like a comedic match we have seen many times before (movies with Arnold Schwarzenegger or Dwayne Johnson), yet the funny formula still works. At least, it did for me, my husband, and the majority of the audience who watched a press screening of this spy comedy last night. The movie isn't exactly ""Fifty shades of amazing"" as one of the character says in the film, but it was still super entertaining and made my tired husband laugh MANY times. That's a huge compliment and endorsement of this spy comedy. We both thought it was cute and enjoyable, despite the many negative reviews we've seen online.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
A surprising amount of profanity for a family-friendly flick. Some crude language.
Lots of violence with a high dead body count. You see a severed head fly by in slow motion, a man get a knife thrown into his leg, tons of people get shot or blown up, hand-to-hand combat, and a variety of weapons.
Two gay men who live together play a large role as neighbors to Sophie. Sophie assumes Bobbi is a lesbian, which is never confirmed, nor denied.
Tons of pop culture references to things young kids may not know anything about like ""Queer Eye"" Brawny Towels, Waze, and lots of older movies. The movie really seems more tailored to older viewers than as a kids' movie.THINGS I LIKED:
Dave Bautista was never on my radar until I first saw him in Guardians of the Galaxy (Theatrical). I LOVE those movies. I'm such a fan of his now and want him to do well in movies like his professional wrestler mentor Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. Dave Bautista seems up for anything and is willing to take some heavy hits and look goofy. Good for him. There is only one obvious body-double moment in the movie when he's ice skating; otherwise, that seems to really be him getting knocked all over the place.
Chloe Coleman is fantastic. I've never watched Big Little Lies. She's occasionally annoying in the movie, but mostly totally adorable.
Kristen Schaal almost always plays a quirky, likable character. She's definitely a highlight in this movie with some of the funniest lines in the cast.
Ken Jeong is always a crowd pleaser, although he usually plays super nasty, crass characters in comedies. I'm happy to announce that he was perfectly clean, although it surprised me that e was used more as a straight man, rather than the funny man that he always is. I've been watching him lately on THE MASKED SINGER and he seems like he'd be a fun guy to hang with who genuinely loves to laugh at anything, including himself.
Because I love movies so much, I always get a kick out of movies that reference or quote other movies. In this funny flick, there were tons of shout-outs to other films, such as Iron Man 2, Notting Hill, E.T.,The Extra-Terrestrial, Mission: Impossible, Shrek, and Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark
I know action sequences in slow motion are super cliche, but I love them anyway. The ones in this movie always got a laugh from the audience.
The music choices supported the comedy and were even the focus of some comedic moments.
I'm completely obsessed with Alexa, so I love that Dave Bautista had one too.
Tons of physical gags that made me laugh out loud like the blinking lesson or when Bobbi started doing bicep curls with her tiny water bottle after watching JJ curl massive water tanks.
I always love a good training sequence.
A cute twist. I love twists and surprises.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Some painfully corny dialogue.
Some people have been complaining that the film doesn't know what it wants to be: action, comedy, coming-of-age, rom-com, or spy movie. It really was all of those things. I think it has to do with expectations. I expected a comedy with a spy setting, so that's what I saw.
You watch Bobbi throw up. Ick.
Did they spray paint the top of Dave Bautista's head or was that his actual hair? It was super distracting and seemed to be the wrong color.
Super predictable.
Some of the acting by side characters is not very good, particularly the other kids. Hey, they're kids.
All of the explosions with fire had really fake-looking CGI.
For a spy movie, there were no super cool, new gadgets. Everything was very old-school.
The rolling credits at the end of the movie just showed clips from the movie, nothing new. I love it when comedies include after-credit scenes to extend the laughter that everyone came to the movie to enjoy.
There are some plot holes, but this movie is not trying to be a serious spy movie, so don't worry about themYou can watch the rest of my review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel!",My Spy

What makes this film watchable is the solid comedy performance by Dave Bautista, while its tale of espionage meets daddy-day care is well handled. It won't blow you away, because it is predictable and repetitive, but that doesn't mean it can't be a good time for a lazy afternoon. Ultimately, ""My Spy"" feels like it's a relic from the 90s, yet it is the light distraction during corona lock-down, though overall it likely wouldn't be something I'd view again.Rating: 6",My Spy

48,SnobReviews,Surprisingly pleasant.,5,10 April 2020,"""My Spy"" is nothing original but still manages to be filled with action, sweet at its core and entertaining.

In this action-comedy, a CIA operative finds himself at the mercy of a 9-year-old girl, having been sent undercover to surveil her family.
.
While we've all seen this genre of film before, ""My Spy"" stays away from being a ""family friendly"" movie and goes more for stylized action and mild cursing. It's worth the watch just to see Dave Bautista and Chloe Coleman together. They're cute, fun and Coleman is great. For a night in quarantine, this easy going flick is a safe bet for young and old.

Director: Peter Segal
Starring: Dave Bautista, Chloe Colman, Parisa Fitz Henly, Kristen Schaal, Ken Jeong etcOverall rating 84/100My Spy is based on a CIA operative JJ (Dave Bautista) who messes up a big mission so is put on a job surveying a family linked to a criminal. But little does he know he will find himself at the mercy of 9 year old Sophie (Chloe Colman). I really enjoyed My spy, it was far from perfect but it was self aware enough to realise that so let's get started.My first two positives would be the action and the lead performance from Dave Bautista. The movie didn't have many action scenes but that wasn't the main focus, but the action sequences that we got at the beginning and end where actually entertaining and well executed for a comedy, and they were proper scenes with humour taking a back seat so this was good. I also have to commend Dave Bautista here for his performance. He was very funny in his interactions with younger kids and his awkwardness with women and people in general was very entertaining to watch, he also showed a hint of versatility with the emotional side of his character as well.My next two positives would be the character background and the film playing with the audience's assumptions and genre conventions. I appreciated the amount of background they gave to the main characters of JJ and Sophie. We really got to understand both of their characters before they met which was great. Sophie was struggling to socialise and make friends after the death of her dad, and JJ messes up a big mission and his career went slightly downhill, it was nice to already feel connected to and like both characters before they bonded as a duo. I also loved how self-aware the film was in terms of playing with the audience's assumptions about characters. It was like the film knew it was predictable, so it incorporated this into the jokes. It was refreshing for me and added more humour to the film as it knew what it was, and this was a fun way of communicating with the audience.However, my first two negatives would be the film was very generic and predictable. The film did follow most of the genre conventions for this genre, whether it was the types of characters, some of it's humour or the situations the characters were put into it did feel like recycled genre tropes. The movie was also very predictable, you could tell what was going to happen throughout and sadly the film never did anything about it with nothing particularly surprising or nothing that you couldn't see coming before it happened.My next two positives would be the film's humour and likeable characters. The movies humour for the most part completely worked and had me laughing on multiple occasions. The comedic performances from the two main characters was infectious, but also Kristen Schaal was fantastic as well, helping Dave Bautista's character on the mission and she was a great addition to the film with multiple different great comedic moments. The movie also just had so many loveable and likeable and characters it was hard not to like it. There wasn't one annoying or unlikeable character apart from the villain which was great, everyone played their role well and I grew a connection to each of the characters and their different personalities.My next two positives would be the chemistry between the characters and the film's charming tone. The chemistry between all of the relationships and friendships in My Spy was fantastic. The father daughter friendship between JJ and Sophie was incredibly heartwarming to watch and they both worked excellently together, but also JJ's relationship with Sophie's mum Kate (Parisa Fitz Henley) was really charming as well, they both connected over having similar hard and challenging lives with the losses of people so their bond was great.My final two negatives would be the film's lack of creativity with the meeting of the two main characters and the lack of focus on the main villain. I thought that they could have come up with a slightly more creative way for JJ and Sophie to meet then JJ just surveying her and her mum, it just felt slightly forced and not realistic. I also thought the film did not focus on the villain. It was so focused on JJ and Sophie and the family dynamic there that they kind of forgot about the villain, he was hardly in the movie and you never really knew much about him apart from the one thing that he wanted, this was a shame as his involvement in the final act didn't really feel earned.My final positive would be the film's fun and satisfying ending. The final act was definitely a lot of fun the action once again was great, they built tension as well, and of course the happy ending felt earned due to the connection to the characters, so JJ, Kate and Sophie were a happy family and he got his job back so this ended the movie on a high note.Overall, despite some creative issues and its recycled formula for the genre. My spy is a great time, with great humour, fantastic connection between the characters and its self-awareness of what kind of movie it is.",My Spy
52,jakethesnake-42007,Deserves more credit,6,14 April 2021,I was actually surprised with this film. I thought it would bad but it actually turned out to be a fun family comedy.,My Spy
53,kermitkid,Sacrifices script for trying to be trendy,4,28 June 2020,"This is a done-to-death premise with films like ""The Game Plan"",
""The Spy Next Door"", and ""The Pacifier."" The difference, is that each of those films did this premise much better. (The Pacifier, being the best one, in my opinion.) I did get a few laughs from Dave Bautista, and it started out kind of entertaining, but around the 45 minute mark, it just fell apart. So much of the script is focused on being ""trendy"" and ""woke"", and for most of this movie I was cringing. There's a scene where Bautista's character is on the dance floor, and in theory, this should be really funny, since there was a similar scene with Vin Diesel in ""The Pacifier"", but here, it's just him dabbing and doing other cringy ""trendy"" things that aren't relevant anymore. The film also thinks that if it acknowledges it's own lazy writing, it's lazy writing will be excusable, but if any thing it just makes it even more infuriating. The biggest facepalms were when Kristen Schall's character brings up the wage gap (which is a myth, btw), and there was another ""woke"" moment that I can't remember now, but I was facepalming and groaning so much.

54,movieman6-413-929510,My Spy is an entertaining yet well-known espionage family comedy.,5,14 March 2020,"My Spy is a new family action comedy directed by Peter Segal, the director of Get Smart and Tommy Boy.The film is about the ex-military JJ (Dave Bautista), who after his time in the army now tries to work as a CIA agent. During his missions he still works too much as a soldier. The CIA does not get the necessary information and decides to use JJ for undercover operation. JJ now has to spy on mother Kate (Parise Fitz-Henley) and her young daughter Sophie (Chloe Coleman) in the hope that her arms trade partner contacts his family. JJ is soon discovered by the clever nine-year-old Sophie, who promises to share nothing about his secret mission with the rest of the world. In return, JJ has to train her on how to become a spy herself.This movie has his amusing moments about how a young girl can outsmart a novice CIA agent. This aspect has come up before in other films such as the Arnold Schwarzenegger film Kindergarden Cop. For people familiar with such films, this film can quickly become predictable. The script clearly shows the bond between JJ and young Sophie, but the film concentrates a bit too much on this band at a time. For example, the aspect of the secret arms trade is somewhat canceled. The scenes that pass here seem a bit like separate scenes from a completely different film. These different aspects only come together at the end of the film, but otherwise seem to have little in common.The comedy moments are also somewhat predictable if you are familiar with these kinds of comedy movies. Dave Bautista comes across as a budding CIA agent who doesn't yet know how to best handle his job. While it seems a bit unbelievable that the CIA is discovered by a nine-year-old girl and she manages to outsmart them, these moments make for the best comedy in the movie. For a novice young actress, Chloe Coleman does good and appropriate acting in this film. The better known comedy actors such as Kristen Schaal and Ken Jeong still have more of a cameo in this film and only have a few small comic moments.",My Spy

Yes, the fact that half the main characters had jazz hands was distracting (4% is the truth people!)! The strong performances by Batista and the little girl carry this story and get it an extra star. Also there are some funny LOL moments that are unexpected and flashes of brilliance. The weird thing was all the cussing. This was a PG-13 but just barely.

It has good amount of humor, decent amount of action, and is emotional/romantic as well. I also thought the pacing was good and never did the movie feel sluggish.The only reason why I won't give this movie 10 stars. Had more to do with the acting. While I enjoyed some of the performances like from Coleman and Henley. Ken Jeong was terribly miscast in this and added zero humor. Schaal was okay but after awhile she got annoying. Bautista while I will say this was step above his other roles hes played.

There's not enough of these good jokes to make this a good comedy, but, enough to make it acceptable.While the girl isn't as cute as she thinks she is, she actually plays the ""smart & cocky"" girl pretty well and her interaction w/Bautista works well. Her mom fits the ""hot mom"" part very well; she doesn't act it very well, though, but, just good enough.The boss is pretty lame, the quirky nerd-partner doesn't really work...

This whole plot line has already been done before by Vin Diesel, Jackie Chan, and other non-name actors in low budget drecks. My Spy is probably the worst because the kid actress acts unrealistically like an adult all the time and it is grating. Why can't kids in movies these days just act like normal kids? Why do all of them have to act like snarky middle-aged jerks?

JJ was a former Special Forces member who joined the agency after his military career ended. After an operation does not go as planned; JJ's boss David Kim (Ken Jeong) questions whether JJ is right for the type of work that is required.JJ is assigned with an overzealous analyst named Bobbi (Kristen Schaal) to conduct surveillance on a single mother named Kate (Parisa Fitz-Henley) and her nine-year-old daughter Sophie (Chloe Coleman).Kate Sophie had just moved from Paris and are struggling to adapt to the new situation. It seems that Sophie's father was deeply involved in all sorts of illegal operations and JJ and Bobbi are keeping an eye on them to see if their uncle attempts to contact them as he's a key figure in an ongoing plutonium arms deal.Things take an unexpected turn when the precocious Sophie figures out that their apartment is loaded with surveillance gear and soon tracks it to an adjacent apartment and confronts JJ and Bobbi.Unwilling to have to admit to his superiors that their cover was blown by a nine-year-old girl; JJ soon becomes Sophie's new friend as she forces him to take her ice-skating and to appear at a school career day as she is desperate to make friends following her move.This arrangement causes issues with Bobbi and she believes that JJ needs to be training her in the finer aspects of his career.Further complicating matters is a growing attraction between JJ and Kate thanks to Sophie repeatedly finding ways for her mother and JJ to be together.While most viewers will be able to see where the film is heading; the enjoyable cast and the chemistry between them makes the movie rise above standard family comedies.Bautista does a great job poking fun at his action persona and clearly showed in his ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" performances that he is certainly capable of mixing comedy and action.While the film does not offer much in the way of surprises; it does offer some very charming and enjoyable moments with enough humor to make it an enjoyable viewing experience for the entire family.3.5 stars out of 5",My Spy

Bautista is already on thin ice with his boss - The Hangover series's Ken Jeong - over a previous mission, and not surprisingly this simple surveillance job goes off the rails, resulting in Bautista ending up partnering with his targets socially outcast daughter in normal, day to day activities, in the same way as most stories where a kid wishes they had an armed assassin by their side to help negotiate the mundane activities of life; wouldn't it be nice if you had a trained assassin to deal with your bullies, type of person.Yes, it's been done before. Flash backs to Arnie films like Kindergarten Cop and True Lies - the latter being referenced numerous times in the film - and even Schaal makes a comment about how familiar the climatic final fight scene is (though she's talking about Harrison Ford), and who builds a runway on the edge of a cliff, evoking memories of the opening of GoldenEye.
Yet, who is it aimed at? The action is pretty tame compared to the Marvel films Bautista is probably more famous for, with the opening fight scene comic in its over the top use of slow motion and explosions backed up with a music selection that Star Lord might not recognise but appreciate. How can you not feel happy listening to ""99 Luftballons"".

I wish they made him the partner instead of Kristen Schaal, I believe they did this on purpose making a women his sidekick for the very reason they said at the end of the movie where they made a political statement for women rights ""Women want equal Pay as men"" I thought this is where the movie just failed all together, If Ken Jeong was his side kick it would of been much more hilarious... too bad...

One benefit of being stuck inside all of the time... is the movies that studios are forced to bring to us. We have been blessed by this mess and I'm grateful for the blessings I have. One of those blessings this week was My Spy. This movie is starring Dave Bautista, as JJ, the meathead C.I.A. agent that gets selected to do the one job he can ""handle"" by watching a daughter and mother, Chloe Coleman, as Sophie, and Parisa Fitz-Henley, as Kate. We all know what happens after that. This movie is exactly what the trailer shows you (check it out below). If you think it's going to happen in the movie... Oh, yeah, it's going to happen. And do you know what? It's still hilarious. I'll admit I'd written this movie off when it was coming to the theaters but since it came to a streaming service I had to give it a shot. Here it goes.Dave Bautista, as rigid and mono-tone, as he is, just has ""it"". And, by ""it,"" I mean that comedic gene. Maybe you love him as Drax in the MCU, but you might say it's the writing. In my opinion, Bautista still hits hard in My Spy. He doesn't have the range of everyone's favorite Dwayne Johnson... yet. I think if he gets a few more diverse roles that don't stifle his growth then he can possibly get there. Did we really think that Arnold Schwarzenegger was going to give us comedic gold throughout the years? We didn't, but here we are watching Kindergarten Cop and Jingle All the Way every year. On the flip side, Chloe Coleman is just a pleasure. Now, they may have given her all the great lines in this movie, but her comedic acting ability is evident. She jumps off the screen... except in her like cry moment... that was forced trash but otherwise so much fun.Bautista and Coleman give The Rock and Kevin Hart a run for their money in this one and, respectively, they are both the same heights. I doubt we'll see another Bautista/Coleman team up, but I hope we see each of them in other parts. My Spy provides action, comedy, and that needed feeling of companionship we can't achieve during the pandemic. This movie created with chemistry and charisma what Coffee and Kareem tried, and failed, to create with vulgarity.Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised by My Spy. I thought this would be a cliched and predictable big bad guy and little kid flick and it was but like Kindergarten Cop back in the day this was ultimately a guilty pleasure film that I don't really feel guilty about.

Clumsy events lead to JJ, who is clearly trying follow fellow fake wrestler, Rock, into stardom, into contact with 11 year old Sophie (Coleman).The linchpin of production is the adult/child act put on well, too well really, by Coleman. I'm ok with a child being intelligent beyond the surrounding adults but it gets wearisome when she's also better informed.From then on it's Coleman's show. She leads the adults around by the nose and in doing so does demonstrate her chops but to the detriment of the movie. Had the director had the spine to reign her in, it'd be a much better show. As it is, it jumps the shark time and again.Also, as nicely ambling along as Bautista is, he's no Dwayne Johnson. Add that this entire setup has been done before and to do it well again, it takes more than a good look set of female leads. It needs some originality.

107,svtcobra331,Updated Kindergarten Cop,7,29 June 2020,"This movie isn't a spy thriller or romantic comedy. It stars a child, so don't expect the CIA CONOPS to be spot on.
A lot of this movie made me cringe.
SPOILERS:
Bullets spontaneously popping out of a magazine. ???
A CIA op where someone can sneak through a door left ajar?
CIA operating in CONUS spying on US citizens????But so what, this movie is an homage to the wonderful 80s action movies where Arnold would stand up with a machine gun blasting at a dozen highly trained mercenaries, none of whom could land a single bullet on the governator. This type of movie is not about reality, it is about aspiration... with the fantasy of saving a beautiful woman who will fawn in awe. (A huge teen fantasy.)So how does this movie compare to the 80s movies?
The hero character was spot-on. He played the stoic special forces vet to perfection. How a special forces operative would allow himself to be totally controlled by a child... well, that's not the actor's fault.
The child delivered a likable and believable character. She was tech savvy, assertive, but not a PITA (pain in the neck) irritation who ran rings around adults. She had the normal child's problem of fitting in.
The mom was very, very watchable, and garnered empathy.
The neighbors really added to the movie and helped movie it along.
The comedy-relief sidekick, an homage to the 80s movies, could have been better thought out. Not to knock the actress, but whoever came up with the idea of impossibly bad gun skillz should understand that an audience can differentiate ""smart"" from ""stupid"", and an audience likes a smart movie. The actress played the role well, but the gun skillz scenes, whoever thought them up, don't hire that person again.The story line had a hole or two, but it's not a Tom Clancy/Ian Fleming movie.

110,Skippy489,Original Spy movie seems to be for an older audience,6,9 October 2020,"For a younger audience, this film would be great. But the language and violence is surprisingly strong for a movie intended for a younger audience. Dave Bautista plays the part well, aside from logistical things pointed out in the goofs and trivia sections on the IMDB page- but that doesn't affect the enjoyment of the film. This film has a hard time finding its target audience. The level of violence is borderline R at times or atleast a hard PG-13. There is language almost in every scene. But yet it is a simple story with a young actress for a young audience. The film serves best as a family film for an older teenage family audience. Surprisingly, there is quite a bit of obvious innuendo for a family film. If this was not marketed at a family audience then the opinion would change.
The film, marketed as a comedy, has a hard time finding the balance between comedy and action. There are memorable scenes that make the film enjoyable, but honestly it is forgettable and that is a disappointment. The trailers that were released for the film (when it was supposed to be a theatrical film way back in 2019)- marketed it as a family friendly film- even with the PG-13 one might think it is just for violence, but it is for violence and language- putting it on the same level as other PG-13. If looking for a family friendly spy movie look at the Spy Kids franchise or The Spy Next Door. If looking to watch a fun film, this would be a fair choice. It is above average but not spectacular.",My Spy

Some are done way worse than this & some are done much better, this one being in the middle, yea there are some laughs along the way but not every joke that is shown is funny & just kinda meh. There is some action along the way but not that violent, to be fair though it does seem to have some good character development with the main roles but the bad side doesn't seem to be much interesting. In another way it is showing that even love can take over your job & there is a soft side to everyone but at the end of the day its your job & as seen in the film, people do get hurt because of the job you have which in this case was being a spy.Don't take this film to be some proper spy film, it is purely a laugh to pass some time, maybe the kids will like it more as it includes the various stupid fortnite dances that every film seems to have these days along with a insane amount of product placement, you know when a film has had to many products in the film, this film has Doritos, Alexa, iPhone & a few others, they make it really obvious, not that its a bad thing ultimately, it just shows they needed some extra cash & the dialog totally changes to suit the product rather than the film.Its cool how they used the young girl to his advantage to help him with the missions but of course in real life it would never happen.Overall though it was a laugh here & there, maybe more for kids than adults, but it will pass some time on a evening on the TV when it eventually comes out but this film won't be raved about in the years to come.Age - 25Cinema: Cineworld Milton Keynes 2D (Unlimited Card)Watch, Avoid, Consider: Watch if you have unlimited card or have kids, otherwise just consider it.",My Spy

From the beginning (funny failed accent by Batista) to the credits (pausing captures on funny facial expressions) everything has been made to give a joyful moment to the viewers.
In many reviews, they keep repeating ""it is cliche"" ... YES, it is and THEY PLAY with almost every cliche you can think of!! And they even make fun of a lot of spy movies!!
At first i was very concerned about the young actress ... but actually she was good at her role {hateful, mischievous, adorable, cocky, ... not many child actors can pull that off; even some adults aren't able to act it that well} and actually she makes a good fun duo with Batista.
I had low expectations at first, but i realised that this movie was genuinely made to give the viewers fun; it is not so centred to the characters or the story itself ... those are just medium to one main purpose: give you fun!!
Once i opened to that idea only, man this movie was great for that! What an evening filled with laughter!{Unlike movies like Ocean 12, Grown ups 2 or Funny People who are telling you it is funny, but it only funny to the actors ... and not truly centred to the viewers' interest}",My Spy

Turns out I was wrong. I am so disappointed.This one is lame, script writing-wise. I only like the idea of the bond between two main characters yet unfortunately the execution is mediocre. Everything else is just boring, predictable cheesy drama, not even close to being a solid action comedy. Dave Bautista is a good actor. I like him (his performance) best in Blade Runner 2049 (2017). But not in this spy thingy.I wonder what Peter Segal thought when he read the lame script and why he'd accept it in the first place. I feel sorry for him.

The only 'objection' I have is when Hollywood insists on hiring older actors to play younger children. Chloe Coleman is 12 years old and yet in the movie, she was (3) times referred to as ""a 9 year old girl"" WHY???
The movie would have been just as interesting and believable if the character of Sophie would have been 12 years old!!! Anyone with half a brain could see that the character of Sophie was older than 9 yrs old.

And I must be honest. I myself expected something a bit different from this movie in the beginning and by the trailers. But I like what it is. I can enjoy the charackters and their interactions, I can laugh at a lot of the jokes, and I can simply sit here and enjoy the simple story, without the need to figure out what is happening and I think this is something you could need on a bad day.So If you want a fun and little movie for your evening after a hard day or for you and your Family, this movie might be worth a Shot.",My Spy

176,seedoeatreview,Quite a nice spy!,7,20 January 2020,"So as the school holidays comes to an end in Australia we finish off with yet another release of a children's film. The funny part is that it's a bit like a recipe, as it contains parts of all the other films I've reviewed already these summer holidays! You take the machismo of Playing with Fire, add the silliness of Farmageddon, plus a touch of heart from Frozen 2, not forgetting some funny one-liners from Jumanji, finish it off with some espionage from Spies in Disguise, garnish it with the child-friendly action of Star Wars and you have a perfectly satisfying film called My Spy. Mr. 9 and I ate it up (and reviewed it) last week when we saw it at Palace Nova cinemas!JJ (Dave Bautista) is an undercover CIA agent who is not exactly inconspicuous. After a weapons deal goes horribly wrong he is assigned to surveillance duty with tech-specialist Bobbi (Kristen Schaal). Their job is to keep an eye on a mother and daughter who may be in danger if a global terrorist finds out where they live. But JJ isn't exactly qualified for surveillance duty and it's not long before he is caught out by clever 9 year old Sophie (Chloe Coleman), the girl he is supposed to be watching. The two work out an arrangement where Sophie won't tell her mum Kate (Parisa Fitz-Henley) that they are being watched, but only if JJ teaches Sophie how to become a spy. The two don't exactly get along but over time a friendship develops, much to the chagrin of Bobbi who knows that this is a serious breach of the CIA surveillance rules. But, as expected, trouble inevitably finds its way into Sophie and Kate's life and we are left to see whether the spy training that JJ gave this precocious 9 year old will succeed or fail spectacularly.THE GOOD
For a film like this, with a storyline that has been done to death plenty of times before, I was actually surprised at how much I liked My Spy. But my enjoyment didn't come so much from former WWE wrestler Dave Bautista (Guardians of the Galaxy, Stuber) but the confidence and acting ability of kid actor Chloe Coleman (Big Little Lies). In a lot of these 'kids teaching adults to be kids' films the child usually comes across as bratty and unlikeable but Coleman finds a great balance of clever, likeable and entertaining which Mr. 9 and I really found appealing. Also when you have a great comedy support cast like Kristen Schaal (Gravity Falls, Toy Story 4) and Ken Jeong (The Hangover movies) the laughter also lifts a notch too.
Mr.9: I really liked Sophie in this film when she is learning to become a spy. The part where she keeps looking at the explosions behind her was really funny because JJ had to keep turning her head around.THE BAD
Bautista seems to have found his niche in Hollywood at taking characters who are large, muscle-bound, meat heads with not much going on upstairs. Alongside professional comedians like Schaal and Jeong his comedic acting can sometimes be painful to watch as he tries to compete with them for laughs but comes across more forced than natural.
And for those of you looking for an action film this is not entirely the case with My Spy. Although it is bookended with big, action, set pieces it is more a romantic comedy as much of the film is taken up with telling the story of JJ's budding friendship with Sophie and finding a possible love interest with her mum, Kate.Mr. 9: It got really boring in the middle because there was no action happening. The bad guy was there at the start and then disappeared until the end of the film. It seemed different from what the trailer showed.THE UGLY
For those of you who are familiar with Dave Bautista you would know that he is bald up top. Yet for some unknown reason the hair and makeup team decided to either spray paint or put a toupee on top of his head which is jet black and extremely short. It looks so unnatural and left me staring at the top of his head for most of the movie. Somewhat in shock and somewhat in fascination I couldn't stop looking at this unusual follicle choice.I didn't have high hopes for My Spy after seeing the trailer but walked out pleasantly surprised at how a completely unoriginal film could be so enjoyable. Bautista's charm and Coleman's likeability really carry this film above 'just another comedy'. An enjoyable film to finish off the school holidays!THREE AND A HALF TOUPEES OUT OF FIVEMr. 9: All the spy stuff was fun and the movie was also pretty funny although it had a lot of swearing for a 'PG' film. Three and a half out five.",My Spy

We watched it on Amazon Prime due to the virus but I imagine it would have been better to watch with other people in theaters.My only gripe was the unnecessary bad language.

Its light, entertaining, and somewhat meaningful even just a little because so many similar movie like this. But yes this is one of the best Dave Bautista movies, aside Stuber and The Final score. He need to be this like protagonist. And maybe slimming a bit like John Cena to be more versatile actor at certain scene.Plus:
Chloe Coleman is an talented actress. 9 y.o. and convinced me she's smarter than all kids of her age. Also can give feels at certain scene while sarcastic funny is really entertaining. She's the one who stole the show.First I didn't like Bobbi characters. Like every stereotypical boomers and function as gag filler. But in the end she's really a decent sidekick.Story is decent. Nothing new but at some points this movie did it better than similar movies. The pacing, gadget used, also building the world around The city, Apartment, and schools truly completed.Batista really feel fleshed out than other of his movies out there. He's not really versatile actors, so he must play in the movie that can adapt to his acting style. And this movie digs it.Minus:
Where is the good action at start of the movie that expected in the last scene? Did the budget only run to first scene only? I'ts disappointing...Greg Bryk has that evil mafia looks but at the end fights, he's a mafia right? Where's his henchmen? Why is he so weak? He's so underutilized.Dave Bautista as spy should understand how to socialize, good looking and blends with environment.

I was apprehensive about watching it, because it definitely looked like it was going to be a cheesy family film and I hate that stuff. It ended up being a sharply written, funny, and ultimately very good little film. The chemistry between Bautista and Coleman was perfect. The two riff off each other as well as Paul Rudd and Seth Rogen. Not to mention, Coleman proves herself to be quite the little comedic virtuoso and Bautista showed a little twinkle of the movie star he is destined to be. I was also pleasantly surprised with the lack of corny, sappy sentimentality that often mars such films. There were very few cringeworthy ""Full House"" moments and I really appreciated that. Finally, I just want to assure any fellow cynics out there, the humor is actually funny. Kristen Schaal brings comedy gold and the humor felt markedly more mature than I expected for a film that has been marketed heavily as a family film. There is a fair amount of profanity and innuendo, but no scatalogical, lowbrow cheap shots and very little slapstick. I highly recommend watching this little gem. It's not what it appears to be. In a good way. You can take my word for it, because I see everything. I give this movie a solid A. Quit acting like you're too cool for this movie and go watch it! You'll thank me.

Dave Bautista does a decent job taking this below average script and making it a watchable movie. The supporting cast kinda just gets lost along the way though, as well as the thinly veiled attempt at a plot.
JJ is an elite ex-soldier trying to make the transition to a spy in the CIA. After blowing one assignment too many, he is given one last chance babysitting a family in Chicago. The only problem is that he gets made by the mark and is now being blackmailed by a 9 year old.
There really isn't anything new here. Following after other action stars who try to make a family movie, Dave Bautista is at least likable enough to keep this movie afloat.

One of the most featured aspects of the film is the pair of Coleman and Bautista who bring a very diverse form of comedy that makes the film feel very lighthearted and enjoyable throughout.

After my wife's near death experience a few months ago, she doesn't laugh as often. This had her laughing to the point of tears.Dave Bautista got to stretch his acting legs a bit in this one. I enjoyed both Guardians Of The Galaxy movies, and it was nice to see him not in so much makeup and prosthetics.The rest of the cast are believable, and one twist even caught us of guard.

Again, not sure the director got all he could? I think the material may have been there. They couldn't pull it up to 11, but they are solid.Kristen Schaal is funny, and actually has a character arc!Oh, and the plot? Have you ever seen a movie where they cast a wrestler with a cute kid in a fish out of water comedy where he ends up dating the mom? The Rock, Hulk Hogan...? Then you've seen this. Vin Diesel in The Pacifier? Same movie. This is probably a better movie, but I could watch a duck bite Vin Diesel on the ear all day and still laugh every time...Bottom line: Nobody was the weak link in the film. Could have been funnier but still pretty good. Watch it with your kids or a margarita, and you'll have a good time.",My Spy

Instead of JJ coming across as the (intended) emotionally distant, he just comes across as stupid. Instead of funny, a lot of the comedic scenes are just (in the words of my 10 year old) ""cringy"" .
This awkwardness may in part be because the movie seems to be distorting the plot and dialogue to show off how woke they are.

265,charlieclark-72166,Incredibly dumb but incredibly funny,7,10 May 2020,"My Spy is a 2020 American action comedy film directed by Peter Segal, written by Jon and Erich Hoeber, and starring Dave Bautista, Chloe Coleman, Kristen Schaal, and Ken Jeong. The film follows a CIA agent who finds himself at the mercy of a 9-year-old girl of a family that he and his tech support is surveilling in undercover.I am unashamedly going to admit I had a great time with this film, I like dumb stuff, I laughed so much during the opening scene, the mix of music and Dave Bautista's reaction too it is a joy to watch, some of the comedy doesn't work, but a lot of it does. The script, written by Jon and Erich Hoeber, is complete nonsense, but it's the best nonsense it can be and provides entertaining viewing.Dave Bautista is a joy, his character is great to watch and funny at the same time, of course I'm going to be a bit bias because I've been watching him in the WWE for a long time, but he's funny and I don't regret saying that. Many of the scenes try way to hard to be funny and many of them pay off, however, where the movie fails is with the action sequences, the comedy side works greatly but the action lets it down a bit, the opening sequence is packed with action and it works really well however the movie doesn't have any more action sequences for the remainder of the first act, I get that comedy is the main point but the action lets this film down. I loved watching Dave Bautista dance, highlight of my day so far its nonsense but hilarious.Chloe Coleman is a nice presence on screen for a young actor and this is far better then the other film she was in this year, Timmy Failure and her chemistry with Dave Bautista works well and the montages of him teaching her to be a spy is funny to watch and the relationship with her character is heart-warming and funny to watch as he mentors her. However, her character is far too smart for a young girl and very manipulative, but I guess that's the fun of her character. Parisa Fitz-Henley works as the love interest and Ken Jong is a nice additions to the film for the few scenes he is in, however I wasn't the biggest fan of Kristen Schaal's character Bobbi, I just found her way to weird and annoying in most of the scenes she's in but does get easier to watch overtime.The main antagonists of this film don't show up for the first hour and when they do the film takes a considerable drop, they aren't compelling or memorable and as soon as the film ends you forget about them. The film works a lot better as a family comedy then it does as an action film. Granted, some of the action works but the emotional moments don't resonate they're resolved way to quickly.If I had seen this movie in the cinema I would be less kind as I wouldn't have wanted to pay the admin, but as I'm watching it on Amazon Prime its the perfect movie to laugh too on a Saturday afternoon. My Spy isn't the best film you'll watch this year, far from it, but for me it was a fun film to watch during another boring day in quarantine. My Spy is a generic family film that sets itself a tad above the rest as it made me genuinely laugh where as other better comedies haven't. You go into it knowing its not going to be the best film, but it was a lot better then I expected plus the soundtrack was brilliant for the tone of the film and the opening and the dance scene were a lot funnier then most films but overall the film is incredibly easy to predict but yet an easy film to enjoy watching.My Spy wont be the best thing you see all year, but it is a great family film to watch during quarantine.",My Spy

I think that about sums it up - What is this movie? What is it trying to be? And when, oh when, will it end?It's a bit too violent and has too many pointless, non-story progressing scenes to be a kids' movie but it is definitely not for adults. All the good bits are in the 30-second advert that convinced us to go and see it.We saw a morning session at the cinema. At 10.57am I checked my watch, at 11.01am I checked my watch and was stunned to find time had completely slowed.Although Chloe Coleman is an excellent actress and very watchable, every other character was unbelievable, unappealing and terribly written. What a waste of clever people like Kristen Schaal (or as I call her, Mel from Flight of the Conchords).My older son thought it was okay but when pressed, couldn't name a favourite scene. The younger one gave up and ended up playing a game on my phone about an hour in.",My Spy
269,grimjawxrules,Easygoing feel-good comedy.,8,5 July 2020,"A movie about a spy that gets too close to the target. This film is nothing revolutionary, but then again it doesn't try to be. The acting overall is great, and the comedy is funny without being too embarrassing. The soundtrack is good, and the plot is decent, even if it's nothing we haven't seen before.If you put on this movie looking to be blown away at huge-budget action and a gamechanging story, you're going to be disappointed.If you put on this movie looking for a light-hearted comedy for some easy entertainment, maybe for a family evening or even just to have running in the background, this is just the thing.",My Spy
270,williamblock-77736,About what you would expect,3,1 July 2020,"My Spy follows the formula of the typical father-figure + daughter film like Game Plan in 2007. Dave Bautista takes his shot at the father figure who, over the course of the movie, builds a connection with the kid and does a great job at that. However, for a film that is rated PG-13, it doesn't really know how to act like one. One scene would be filled with family friendly G movie content while the very next will have a character murdering someone two feet away from the camera. It's just all over the place.Since the movie is all about building connections to the characters as they develop, the first third of the movie feels very dry. The story focuses on how a guy who doesn't express his feelings grows to open up to those he cares about even if that means disclosing classified information. As a result, the first third of the movie feels emotionless during the scenes where JJ, David Bautista's character, seems like he should be sad. While is does a great job at showing how he doesn't express feeling, it makes it so the audience doesn't really care and connect with the main character as much as I think was intended.In addition, the character of JJ's ""assistant"" Bobbi (played by Kristen Schaal) is one of the most intolerable characters I have ever seen in a movie. Almost none of the jokes she says are funny and almost none of her lines mean anything to the plot. She is a walking terrible joke machine who loves to make it clear to the audience that she is eating Doritos. She also spends half the movie being jealous over how much attention a nine year old is getting instead of her.Aside from this, I thought the chemistry between JJ and the kid, Sophie (played by Chloe Coleman), was great and they did a great job at playing off that throughout the middle part of the movie. I found a lot of the scenes with them to be really enjoyable and fun as we see Sophie get JJ to start opening up and begin to have a normal life as he teaches her some things about how to be a spy.However, the last leg of the movie tears this all down through bad writing and story telling. When the villain finally makes their way to what we have been waiting for the whole film, the movie turns into a huge mess. Characters go all over the place and cheesy action and jokes make the whole thing very weird. The acting also seems to take a dip near the end as the more PG-13 parts of the movie meet the G parts. This mixes to crest a sort of Disney-original type feel.Overall, I found the beginning and end of the movie to be a bit dry and cheesy while the middle part was quite enjoyable to watch.4/10",My Spy
271,waugh-12428,Not original but who cares,7,28 June 2020,"Not sure why everyone seems to be hating on this movie. Its not gonna score points for originality but it does make up for it in charm.
First, David Bautista is really funny. For being a big lumbering, kinda scary looking guy, he actually has some comedic chops. From Guardians of the Galaxy to Stuber and now this, he has really shown his funny side. He has really good report with his costar who isnonly nine years old. They are cute together, have some very funny moments and some charming moments.
The romance with the mom is just ok, except the dance scene, which was really funny and the villian is pretty much non existant. His partner, kristin Schall is pretty funny. She is always fun to watch.

277,iddt,A great and really funny comedy and great acting teamwork to make it possible.,8,14 April 2020,"Its been rare to find a good movie during the last year filled with reruns and horribly bad plots carried by nice CGI alone. Instead TV-shows have stepped up and really set new standards in quality in all categories.
Especially in the writing department not forgetting about the main purpose.
To tell a story, an epic story and the way its being told depends on the actors and the allocated funds which have been very generous among the best made.Watching the trailer gave me a very good approximation of the movie and what to expect. There are plenty of jokes to go around so its not one of those trailers showing everything thats good in a movie and then you find out the rest is trash. =)
My rating is based on the genre and is only relevant for comparing the same types of movies aiming towards giving the audience a great story taking some liberties with realism from the get go.
Not trying to portray how CIA works in reality, not even remotely close. So ignore the laws and regulations found in real life and instead enjoy their version of CIA from a comedy standpoint thats not stupid but instead hilarious and a backbone for the predicament facing the character played by Batista.The plot is great when it comes to creating a seamless flow of interaction between the main characters. The girl helps out a lot with her acting skills which are really good for someone her age and she makes the duo come to life and creates the basis for many of the really funny scenes and jokes.

314,allymcbeal-16783,Thank you for a great film,10,26 June 2020,It has been a long time since a great comedy was released. I loved every minute. I'll def watch this again.,My Spy
315,dawsonchilders,"Funny and sweet, Chloe Coleman steals the show",10,28 June 2020,"My Spy is great, it's silly and heartwarming and the perfect family flick to help ride out these hard times (but would also be the perfect movie for when times get good again)I'm not going to spend too much time gushing over Bautista because everyone knows he is awesome, it is a scientific fact.I'm here to talk about Chloe Coleman because she steals the show. Her acting abilities reveal a young woman who is wise beyond her years - she has that Dakota Fanning quality of a youth who can chew up the scenery like an old pro, remember her name and keep your eyes on her career so you can say you were a fan before she blew upWatch My Spy, just do it, you know you want too.",My Spy
316,timspencer-10817,Lots of fun,10,30 June 2020,"I wasn't to excited to watch a kid movie, but my daughter and I needed a movie night. We both laughed a lot and loved the duo. We both want to watch it again with the rest of the family. Bautista was definitely A lot of fun to watch, and Coleman played well with him. Light hearted funny movie.",My Spy
317,nkenapatrice,BEWARE - Cute but THAT LANGUAGE though...,2,30 June 2020,"WHY WHY WHY do they keep making KIDS movies with such bad language. The thing is, those words serve NO PURPOSE. If you're making a movie for adults, then expletives may be appropriate in certain situations. But this movie is clearly a kids movie (not like say, Star Wars, which was made for adults, though kids enjoyed it). The language just doesn't make sense. In fact, it distracts from what would otherwise be a cute-ish movie.I'm not overly sensitive. However, I do try to be a good parent, which includes shielding my son from things he's not ready for. This movie had (what my 9-year old called) ""the S-word"", ""the B-word"", the ""D-word"", and the ""A-word"". I'm pretty sure I even heard the ""F-word"" in a song at the end of the movie. Other words like ""hell"" and ""d**k"" (said by a child who called an adult one) were thrown about, too. Like, a lot! I get a random ""minor"" cuss words like those every now and then, especially in a PG-13 movie. But I feel the sheer amount of cursing in My Spy is irresponsible, unnecessary, and even, unoriginal. *RATING - 0 STARS FOR THAT*On another note, I was upset by the gay man stereotype portrayed in the movie. We're advocates everyone being represented in media, but totally against promoting false stereotypes. BUT that issue is resolved at the end of the movie. THANK GOD. I actually ended up really liking how they handled that. *RATING - 1 STAR FOR THAT*Acting is not Oscar-worthy but entertaining, especially by the supporting characters. And we loved the multicultural cast. *RATING - 1 STAR FOR THAT*TOTAL RATING - 2 stars (with the caveat that, per the rating, this is totally inappropriate for most kids under 13... even tough anyone OVER 13 will find this kids movie this silly.) So, who is this for?????",My Spy
318,vikashghoerbien,Enjoyed with teens,7,19 August 2020,"A nice movie we enjoyed. A nice action comedy. I've seen a lot of them which were a bad time spending. But this one was nice.Agree with a few reviews I read: @snobmedia, STEVE24BUS, JohnSnow95",My Spy

324,kcdwtmx,Fun movie,9,5 January 2021,It was surprisingly good. Usually these muscle men paired with kid movies don't work but this one really does. It's really funny and it hooked me from the beginning. I was pleasantly surprised. Quarantined household has multiple age ranges and everyone enjoyed this.,My Spy
325,derrickt-69765,Must wach,10,8 March 2021,Kept me watch till the end best movie I seen in a while,My Spy
326,tfboquet,Better than you'd think!!,8,31 July 2021,"Throughly enjoyed this movie! Dave Bautista is too funny and the movie moves along pretty good. Many times I found myself laughing out loud. That doesn't happen a lot with most movies. If you like Bautista, this one's destined to become a cult classic!",My Spy
327,And_movies,Same thing,2,29 July 2021,"I know 2 other films that are similar to this film, ""The Pacifier"" and ""The Spy Next Door"" and this movie follows the same checklist as the other 2, which get kinda boring seeing it the same thing.Checklist
1. An Asian (boss/agent)
2. Betrayal (the hero is betrayed by some they know)
3. Single Mom
4. Kid(kids) learn something from ""hero"" to use against bad guys
5. Kid helps Beat bad guys.6. Hero falls in love.I was hoping this would be different but nope.",My Spy
328,pscaddan,Nice with the kids.,7,28 June 2020,"I think some of these reviewers are being a little harsh here. 3/10? Really? For an afternoon distraction with the kids I really enjoyed this. Chuckled more than a few times out loud and Bastista was surprisingly convincing as an awkward Army Ranger/Spy come sensitive protagonist. No Oscars here, but this was the same Academy that thought The Shape of Water was fabulous. Worth the 90 minutes.",My Spy
329,laurensvanderlinden,Fun family and entertaining,8,15 May 2020,"No, it's not an Oscar winning movie, yes it has cliche stuff... but in the end I was entertained, I laughed and I had fun. Most movies nowadays try to be something ""special"" this one is just being movie!",My Spy
330,jhbrewer-322-988629,Funny!,9,21 December 2020,"If you want to laugh, you have to watch ""My Spy."" Yes, it is somewhat predictable, but there are a couple of unexpected moments, and the chemistry between JJ and Sophie is great. This is not suitable for young kids due to some violence and language. Watch for homages to other movies.",My Spy
331,dazykyms,Enjoyed,10,11 July 2020,We watched this with our middle schoolers and we all enjoyed it. Bad language was in it but not terrible. I liked that there was no major violence in it. Some people died but it wasn't gory. It had a good story line.,My Spy
332,micsmith99,Not for younger kids,6,29 June 2020,"An prime it was rated 7+, there were a lot of swearing in the movie for PG. It's a good movie but needs to decide if it's a kids movie or adult. Felt more like a teen movie.",My Spy
333,michaelsharkey,Great family movie,10,28 June 2020,"A funny family movie that was enjoyable to watch. It has the right balance of cuteness, action and comedy to keep all ages interested from start to finish. Chloe Coleman really did a fantastic job in her role and it seemed like there was genuine positive chemistry between her and Dave Bautista.",My Spy
334,slanker125,Loved all of the Emotions in one Movie!,10,7 February 2020,"I saw this movie with my 4 daughters and we all Loved it! We are not professional movie reviewers or anything like that but absolutely enjoyed all the different emotions in this movie, it was Charming, Comical, Witty, Action Packed, Heart Warming, Suspenseful, and more! We also loved the relationship between David Batista & Chloe Coleman..... just Precious, and their performances charming! There was some violence and language but nothing bloody or disgusting.",My Spy
335,frl89,Great for mature kids,8,1 March 2020,"A friend gave me early access tickets to go see this with my daughter for her birthday.I've got to say we thought it was hilarious, but it's not a movie for critics or someone who is not comfortable with having their kids hear cuss words. As for me and my daughter it was great. It has a little bit of a romcom vibe, mixed with an unconventional mentor mentee relationship with action scenes. Sophie and JJ's relationship is adorable! Also loved that Ken Jeong (The Hangover) makes a small appearance in this too!Great movie to take your mature kids to. We plan on buying it once it comes out for purchase.",My Spy
336,magnus-lindgren,...but totally enjoyable!,7,12 April 2020,"Light-hearted, predictable, very unrealistic, but totally enjoyable!! I even laughed out loud several times... This movie might be just what you need during these hard times",My Spy

339,jeffrylouis509,"PG 13, really?",5,9 July 2020,I gave this movie a 5 🌟 because it's a goofy movie one should have been able to enjoy with their family. The plot and the story line were predictable but okay for a fun family movie... But they had to ruin it with some language that are not suitable for a young child... I don't need my 9 year old asking me what's a prostitute. I'm glad I watched it first.,My Spy
340,californiabeachgirl,Parent Guide is wrong. So funny!,9,26 June 2020,"The movie is fantastic! It's so funny! Kept me and my family laughing the whole time! There are some fun twists to the movie that make it even better. There is a lot more language in the movie that the parent guide says. A lot more s words, and b words, they take the Lord's name in vain a few more times than listed and same with His Son. The mother mouths ""What the fu"" and its cut away before she actually finishes mouthing it (we don't hear it at all not even the start its all mouthed). Other than more language than expected its a great movie!! I highly recommend!",My Spy

342,sirphoenixmaximus,It is what it is and it is funny,9,8 June 2021,This isn't a super creative high brow movie but you know what it is and it's done really well.

343,nobullfitness,Big Lug softened by child.,6,26 June 2020,Typical KINDERGARTEN COP or GAMEPLAN type gig. It's got a cute premise. It's a cute movie to watch while you're quarantined. Nothing to write home about.,My Spy
