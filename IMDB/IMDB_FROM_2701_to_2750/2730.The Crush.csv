0,SnoopyStyle,Lolita thriller,5,9 September 2016,"Nick Eliot (Cary Elwes) is a new writer at Pique magazine. He rents the guest house of the Forresters (Kurtwood Smith, Gwynyth Walsh). Darian (Alicia Silverstone) is their flirtatious daughter. Cheyenne (Amber Benson) is her best friend. Nick starts dating coworker Amy Maddik (Jennifer Rubin) but Darian's crush also intensifies. Darian continues to hound him and even sabotages his big interview.The Lolita aspect of this performance from a younger Silverstone can be awkwardly uncomfortable. This doesn't have any pretension of being a literary touchstone. The movie manipulates the tension and pushes it beyond logic. It walks the line of camp and doesn't always succeed.",The Crush
1,gavin6942,A Dark Thriller,7,30 May 2016,"A journalist (Cary Elwes) becomes the unwanted center of attention for a 14-year-old girl (Alicia Silverstone), who proceeds to sabotage his life after he refuses her sexual advances.This is Alan Shapiro's baby. He wrote it, directed it, and as of 2016, it remains his best-known film. According to Jennifer Rubin, Shapiro also worked closely with Cary Elwes during the shoot to revise some lines here and there. (Incidentally, Rubin also recalls Elwes as ""mannered and proper"", much like some of the characters he plays.) To save a few dollars, the wardrobe department actually picked clothes from the actors' closets.Apparently this film was panned by critics, but I have to say those critics were wrong. Yes, some of the plot makes little sense and you have to really suspend your disbelief at times. But this is a horror thriller, so just allow yourself that privilege. This film stuck with me when I first saw it in the 90s, and watching it again now (2016), it had as much or more of an impact.The two leads are great. Obviously, this helped launch Silverstone's career (giving her a voice after working with Aerosmith); Kurtwood Smith recalls that the cast had Silverstone's 16th birthday party a day or two before shooting began. The part almost went to Reese Witherspoon, but in retrospect Silverstone seems to have been the obvious, better choice.And this was a nice entry for Elwes, who is generally thought of more as a comedic actor. He can do dark (see ""Saw""). Add model and horror icon Jennifer Rubin and Smith (not to mention a pre-Buffy Amber Benson) and you round out a top-notch cast for what appears to be a very low-budget movie (and obviously the crown jewel of writer-director Alan Shapiro's career).The effects are pretty decent and convincing. Perhaps the most notable scene involves a room full of bees. While it looks like Jennifer Rubin is being swarmed by an entire hive of bees, she actually has nothing to worry about. A few dead ones are glued to her hand (look closely how they don't move), and the ones flying through the air aren't bees at all -- it's puffed rice being blown out of a vacuum cleaner. Genius! One flaw, which is unavoidable, is the result of legal trouble: the original audio has the character named ""Darian"", and it had to be changed to ""Adrian"" (as there was a real Darian involved who had actually keyed Shapiro's car). This makes for some unusual dubbing. Although not noticeable most of the time, it does stand out occasionally -- Kurtwood Smith was never made aware of the change until later, meaning someone else had to dub him... which, of course, makes the name ""Adrian"" sound like it comes from another person's mouth.The disc from Scream! Factory is excellent and truly a must-have. Although they were not able to fix the sound ""phasing"" issues from previous versions, this was not noticeable for me and probably won't be for more viewers. The disc has an audio commentary from writer-director Alan Shapiro, which is priceless (and includes a story of his time swapping LSD stories with William Hurt). But we also get some one-on-one interviews with Kurtwood Smith and the incomparable Jennifer Rubin. A great release for an under-appreciated film.",The Crush
2,ccthemovieman-1,Alicia Was Hot Stuff In '93,4,19 February 2008,"Word was that ""you have to see this Alicia Silverstone; she's really hot."" That was back in 1993, so I checked out the movie. This was Alicia's film debut and she got a lot of hype for this movie.I discovered, yeah, Silverstone has a pretty face, but that's about it. The movie was nothing special; not something you haven't seen before. Cary Elwes, not Silverstone, ruins the picture. Not literally him; the character he plays: ""Nick."" What a dork! Nick is an incredibly stupid guy who befriends the 14-year-old ""Adrienne"" (Silverstone), who is his neighbor. The girl, who then expects more from the guy and doesn't get it, vents her wrath on him. Nick is so annoying I didn't care what the stupid neighbor did to him. Both of the lead characters deserved each other.Whatever happened to Silverstone? I guess she never really made it to stardom. The last I remember her was playing ""Batgirl"" with George Clooney and Arnold Schwarzenegger.",The Crush
3,Coventry,'Clueless' thriller,4,22 August 2005,"Alan Shapiro's first film intended for cinema distribution was (and still is) immensely popular even though it's a bunch of unoriginal nonsense. ""The Crush"" all the more proves that you don't really need an intelligent idea or a well-plotted story as long as you've got an attractive actress to play the lead-role Especially not when you manage to convince the audience that she's only 14 years old, but with the curves of an irresistible bikini-model. This is yet another fancy-looking thriller that combines the success of Stanley Kubrick's ""Lolita"" with the typical 'lethal-beauty' premise of ""Fatal Attraction"", and the result is a very routine and forgettable chiller with depthless characters and predictable situations. The only trump here is a gorgeous Alicia Silverstone in her debut as the obsessive stalker-girl Darian, who takes an unhealthy interest in the new tenant of her parents' studio. He  an untalented writer  politely turns down her approaches, but this only makes her more aggressive and determined. It doesn't take long before unpleasant things start to happen to the writer and his girlfriend but, of course, nobody suspects the cherubic Darian of being responsible. Cary Elwes' acting is downright awful and he makes Silverstone look like she's Oscar material, even though her performance is mediocre at best. The story moves very slow and doesn't dare to go controversial. Shapiro has the opportunity to insert the taboo-topic of sex with minors but he reluctantly avoids it, like he was already afraid of receiving negative remarks before his film is even released. All the talking about ""Wuthering Heights"" is really boring and the only few action sequences are very tame. The ending of this film is overly weird and misfit and involves a wild carrousel-ride in the atticor something like that. The supportive roles are decent, with Kurtwood Smith (""Robocop"") as Silverstone's unaware dad and Jennifer Rubin (""Bad Dreams"") as the writer's girlfriend.",The Crush
4,sunwarrior13,Watching At Alicia With The Mute Button Saves The Movie From the Lowest Rating,3,6 December 2020,"Cary Elwes and Alicia Silverstone stars in this movie written and directed by Alan Shapiro based on the events of his own life entitled ""The Crush"".A journalist becomes the unwanted center of attention for a 14-year-old girl, who proceeds to provide distraction of her life,after she refuses his sexual advances.The movie is definitely a ridiculous as it lacks truthfulness.Also,it is full of stupidity.Finally,it lacks respect of the intelligence of the viewers watching the movie.The only good thing about the movie is the presence of Alicia Silverstone who provides sexiness and elegance during her scenes in the movie. That alone is enough reason to allow the movie from the lowest rating even with the ""mute"" button on.",The Crush
5,Theo Robertson,Deja Vu Thriller Without Thrills,3,1 April 2002,"By 1993 the "" Person From Hell Stalking You  "" thriller had gone stale . No , strike that last comment read it had quickly decomposed leaving a terrible stench.  After seeing obsessed fan from hell , lodger from hell , flatmate from hell , policeman from hell etc , did we really need to see a 14 year old lolita from hell picture ? and if we did then did we need to see a film this bad ?Bad is the best adjective for THE CRUSH as in bad taste. Without doubt the worst bad taste moment is a ***** POSSIBLE SPOILER ***** plot device involving a used condom ! And if you think that sounds silly wait till you see how it fits into the film. Other faults include a total lack of character motivation which led me to ask "" Why on earth is Adrian doing this ? "" every five minutes . Oh and Adrian is a girl , why Adrian has a male name is beyond me.In its defence I will say THE CRUSH does have one of the greatest pieces of bitchy dialogue I have ever heard where Adrian spouts that some men like women with small breasts which had me laughing out loud , but is it something a 14 year old girl would say ?",The Crush
6,Hey_Sweden,Hilarious.,7,4 August 2013,"This sexy thriller is very much entertaining for the *wrong* reasons. It's absurd, trashy, and utterly laughable. It does have a memorable antagonist in the form of young Alicia Silverstone, who plays Adrian Forrester, a Lolita-ish 14-year-old who develops a serious crush on Nick Eliot (Cary Elwes), the 20-something journalist renting a guest house from her parents (Kurtwood Smith, Gwynyth Walsh). Of course, nobody believes the older man when he protests that the crazed girl is the wrongdoer, and Nick finds his life continuously going awry as she creates one problem after another.Written and directed by Alan Shapiro, this film doesn't exactly have the brightest characters. As a result, you never really root for Nick. Fortunately Silverstone, who'd previously made her name in Aerosmith rock videos, is a total hoot as this deranged gal who does some pretty nasty things to make her crush look bad. And things do indeed look very bad for Nick when she frames him for sexual assault. Elwes does what he can with his obtuse role, while Smith has some choice moments as the dad. Jennifer Rubin looks quite lovely as the photographer whom we know is more appropriate for Nick. And Amber Benson lends some solid support as Adrians' ""friend"" who tries to warn Nick about what she knows.The movie *is* well paced and climaxes in one of the more priceless confrontation scenes that you're likely to see in this sort of thing. The ending is actually rather effective in its payoff of the Adrian character.Silverstone may well have had a body double for the nude scenes, but it's still quite uncomfortable when remembering that the character being watched is a mere 14 years old.All in all, ""The Crush"" is entertaining if exploitative trash, and should never ever be taken too seriously.Seven out of 10.",The Crush
7,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Average... very average,6,10 October 2004,"Watching this film again, after several years, after having seen many far better films since the first time I saw it, I can't help but compare it to looking at an old class photo, from a school you only spent one year at, and didn't like too much; you recognize a lot of the faces, but you can't bring yourself to look too long at it, and soon you start paying attention to something else. Of course, you knew from the beginning that it would probably end up like that, and before you know it, you've pushed the memory almost entirely out of your head, once again. Yes, there is a good amount of talents involved in this film, and I quickly recognized Cary Elwes, who I've also seen in Liar Liar, Bram Stoker's Dracula and Robin Hood: Men in Tights, and Kurtwood Smith, who I only know from the original RoboCop, where he played Clarence Boddicker. Of course I recognized Alicia Silverstone as well, but I already knew she was in the film, as I had seen her in one film before seeing The Crush the first time(can't remember which, though). The plot is pretty much a rehash of Lolita, with the tables turned to provide mainstream cliché thriller, in the vein of films like The Hand That Rocks The Cradle. The pacing is daft. The acting is decent, but one would expect better from Elwes and Silverstone(then again, it was her first film... still, we don't see any of the talent that she proved she had in later films). I suspect it's the directors fault. Misdirection, or simply bad direction, can ruin a lot. The characters are the usual clichés and stereotypes of the thriller-genre. The film lacks any real thrills, and relies entirely on the typical formula of this type of thrillers(the psycho-close-to-the-lead(s)-tries-to-kill-him/her/them). The film has no surprises and is thoroughly predictable. All in all, the film has no real purpose, apart from seeing Cary Elwes and Kurtwood Smith in different roles(from what I've seen them in, at least). I recommend it purely to big fans of any of the three actors and very big fans of thrillers. Everyone else should probably avoid it. 6/10",The Crush
8,view_and_review,Damn You're Dumb Dude,6,16 April 2020,"""The Crush"" is a headbanger of a movie. I mean that you will be banging your head against a hard surface at the stupidity of Nicholas Eliot (Cary Elwes).Nick got caught up in a real bad situation because of Adrian Forrester (Alicia Silverstone). Adrian was a brilliant yet precocious and flirtatious 14-year-old girl. She had a crush on the new tenant of her parents' guest house, Nick. Nick allowed himself to be entrapped by Adrian which got him in all kinds of hot water.This movie only works if you have an Adrian-- brilliant, flirtatious, obsessive--and a Nick: stupid, obtuse, naïve. A smarter more perceptive guy would never have been in the situations Nick found himself in. Or should I say that a smarter more perceptive man with more self-control would not have been in the situations Nick found himself in. Because he either had to be incredibly naïve or incredibly turned on to risk his job, his dignity, and his freedom to do what he did with a 14-year-old.Should have done:1. When she invited herself into his room and sat down to chat he should've said, ""No, this is not appropriate.""2. When she was in his house while he was showering he should've said, ""Get out!""3. When she wanted him to give her a ride in his car to the lighthouse he should've said, ""No!""4. When she leaned in to kiss him he should've given her a stiff arm (but if you refer to #3 he would never had been in that position).
Should NOT have done:1. Said to her ""You know if you were ten years older"" as an indication that he would like to hook up with her.2. Gone in her room.3. Hid in her room closet while she was undressingThese were all common sense dos and don'ts. It doesn't take Dr. Ruth, Dr. Phil, or a rocket scientist to tell you that you had crossed the line one too many times. Where was Nick from anyway? Or maybe Nick liked the attention and was genuinely attracted to Adrian. After all, she did look and behave as though she were a lot older.Whatever the reason, Nick was a mouth-breathing idiot, and he deserved every bit of shame, pain, and suffering he got. Sometimes you have to pay for your stupidity, it's called social Darwinism. Not that I'm absolving princess promiscuity of anything because she definitely needed some serious therapy and her parents needed a serious wake-up call. In short, there was plenty of blame to go around",The Crush
9,Uriah43,Follows the Standard Format,6,25 June 2015,"""Nick Eliot"" (Cary Elwes) has just moved to Seattle and needs a place to stay prior to working as an investigative journalist for a magazine there. He settles on a semi-furnished guest house belonging to a married couple by the name of Cliff Forrester (Kurtwood Smith) and his wife ""Liv"" (Gwynyth Walsh). Also there is their 14-year-old daughter ""Adrian"" (Alicia Silverstone) who immediately develops a crush on Nick. Since he is twice her age he figures that her attraction to him is nothing serious. Big mistake. Anyway, as far as this film is concerned it pretty much follows the standard format of any number of similar movies made both before and after. However, what distinguishes this one is the performance of Alicia Silverstone in her very first film debut. Likewise, both Jennifer Rubin (as ""Amy"") and the aforementioned Cary Elwes also performed quite well too. Again, the story is pretty formulaic but even so I thought it was still enjoyable. Accordingly, I rate this movie as slightly above average.",The Crush
10,Wuchakk,Quality lethal Lolita flick,8,19 September 2015,"Released in 1993, ""The Crush"" is about a 28 year-old writer, Nick (Cary Elwes), who moves to Seattle to work for a magazine. After moving into the guest house of the well-to-do Forresters their only child, 14 year old Adrienne (Alicia Silverstone), develops an increasingly unhealthy crush on him. Jennifer Rubin and Matthew Walker play Nick's girlfriend & boss while Kurtwood Smith and Gwynyth Walsh play Adrienne's parents and Amber Benson her neighbor.This belongs to the Lethal Lolita sub-genre of drama/romance/thrillers. These movies always involve a hot teenager who utilizes her freshly bestowed womanly powers to seduce an older man and create havoc. ""The Crush"" is actually better than Stanley Kubrick's revered ""Lolita"" (1962), which was the first of its kind (at least the first to popularize the topic anyway). In the early 90s these kinds of movies made a comeback with 1992's ""Poison Ivy"" starring Drew Barrymore. ""The Crush"" isn't haunting and artsy like ""Poison Ivy,"" but it's just as good and arguably marginally better. ""Poison Ivy"" has better style while ""The Crush"" is more straight-forward, sort of like 1987's ""Fatal Attraction,"" but with a teenage antagonist.Speaking of which, Alicia shines here in her cinematic debut. She was only almost-16 during filming, but easily commands attention throughout. Elwes is great as the protagonist with solid support from Rubin.These types of attractions happen all the time in real life (a teenage girl developing a crush on an older guy) and it's the responsibility of the adult to erect and maintain proper boundaries so the situation doesn't spin out of control, like it does here. If the adult lets things go too far the girl will either be so devastated she becomes nigh suicidal, like in 1976's ""Lifeguard,"" or she turns malevolently psycho.To me ""The Crush"" would've worked better as a bittersweet coming of age drama, like the subplot of ""Lifeguard,"" rather than a drama that morphs into thriller bordering on horror, like ""Fatal Attraction."" The first half is strong as a coming-of-age drama before transforming into the latter in the second half with its contrived thriller/horror mechanics. But they didn't ask me to write the script so I accept the movie as is. As a matter of fact, I feel it breaks the threshold of greatness for what it is.The movie runs 89 minutes and was shot in Vancouver, British Columbia.GRADE: A-",The Crush
11,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Decent enough, but very predictable",5,3 February 2004,"The Crush was one of those movies that I absolutely admired as a kid, I thought this movie was so awesome and intense well, I was a kid, give me a little credit. Re-watching this movie, I didn't realize that maybe it wasn't that great of a movie like I had remembered. It was a pretty unoriginal plot, didn't add much of it's own taste or style and was pretty silly over the top. But still I'm not going to diss the film entirely, this was the beginning of Alicia Silverstone's career and she pulls in a strong performance and was very chilling on screen with Cary Elwes. The story may not be original but Alicia and Cary made the story work.Arriving in a new city, writer Nick Eliot secures a job at Pique magazine and lodgings in a guest house belonging to Cliff and Liv Forrester. Nick soon makes the acquaintance of the Forrester's 14-year-old daughter Adrian, a precocious gifted girl who develops an intense attraction to him. She secretly helps Nick by sneaking into his room and rewriting one of his Pique stories, which subsequently wins a rave from his editor/boss Michael. At a party thrown by the Forresters, Nick agrees to accompany the lonely girl on a nightly drive to a romantic spot, where she kisses him. This intensifies Adrian's crush on Nick, but he quickly wises up and attempts to put her off, having begun a budding romance with co-worker Amy. Adrian continues to boldly pursue him, even going so far as to undress in his view. Nick, however, continues to rebuff her advances, and Adrian's actions become destructive, she smashes a car he's restored and erases his computer discs with his work on it. Then, after Adrian spies on Amy in bed with Nick, you thought Adrian was crazy before, just wait to see what happens next.Over all The Crush is a decent enough movie to watch, I wouldn't dismiss it completely, just if you catch it on TV, check it out. I thought that the scene where Cary is hiding in Alicia's closet to find out what she's really been up too and she knows that he is there, so instead of freaking out, she just undresses in front of him with a seductive look. Also where you see that she has beaten herself up just to get back at Cary's character was very chilling. The Crush has good moments, but it is flawed and in my opinion there are some scenes that could have had a little more, like the hornets that Alicia uses to attack Cary's girlfriend with, afterwards in the hospital, she really doesn't look that injured. But it's mindless entertainment, the new twist on Fatal Attraction, so if you dig these thrillers then The Crush is right up your alley.5/10",The Crush
12,MovieAddict2016,Entertaining in a bad way.,5,4 September 2005,"""The Crush"" is about a fourteen-year-old girl (Alicia Silverstone) who falls in love with a journalist neighbor, played by Cary Elwes (of ""Saw"" infamy).Elwes rejects her come-ons and after she tries to kiss him gives her a slight warning. However her advances are so strong that after a while he is left dazed, as she accuses him of sexual abuse and has the police arrest him.Destined to clear his name for good, he embarks on a mission to expose her ""crush"" - and prove to everyone once and for all that she's a psychopath.A lot of movies like this were made back in the '80s and '90s starting with ""Fatal Attraction,"" although this is one of the more entertaining ones. As far as the acting goes, Silverstone is very sexy (she was older than 14 during filming so I can say this without coming across as a perv) - she's good at playing a devious flirt.Elwes experiments with his off-again-on-again American accent and the good news is that it's more convincing here than in ""Saw"" (2004). Except for a few scenes, he pretty much sounds convincing. His acting is up to par as well.It's not a great movie but it's entertaining, which is exactly what it should be.",The Crush

Supposedly titillating, but too routine and by-the-numbers to achieve any real heat.

Nick didn't help himself from getting Adrian out of his hair and him into her fantasy world by renting an apartment from her parents Cliff & Liv Forrester, Kurtwood Smith & Gwynwth Walsh, that he thought would give him all the peace & quite that he needed to do his work. What in fact Nick got was a hell on earth with the oversexed Adrian turning his life upside down as well as anyone else she thought was getting in the way of her attempted planned and calculated seduction of Nick! Which included his co-worker at the trendy Pique Magazine that he worked for photographer Amy Maddik, Jennifer Rubin.You just couldn't help feeling for the poor guy in how far Adrian would go to get him sexually involved with her. Knowing that it's not right as well as sinful for him to have anything to do with the very sexually aggressive Adrian, Nick was 28 and she 14, he still gave into her advances by taking Adrian out late at night to a local lovers lane and planting a harmless kiss on her cheek. This started her engine going in Adrian going all he way to get Nick to become her secret lover or if not destroy is life which in fact, up until the last few minutes of the movie, she did!It was in fact Adrian's girlfriend Cheyenne, Amber Benson, who tried to warn Nick to stay away from her in what she did the year before to a camp counselor whom she forced, by exposing herself to him, to get involved with her at summer camp. This not only cost the guy his job but reputation, in him being left alone with young girls, by being declared a sexual predator by the court!

A by now an all that he can take Nick finally put an end to Adrian's reign of terror, on older men, by taking her out not on a date but with a solid straight left to the jaw before she could do any more damage!In the end Adrian is put into a mental institution for the juvenile criminally insane where instead of her getting cured from her fixation on getting it on, sexually, with older men was only intensified by her secretly planning to get it on with her court appointed kind and understanding psychiatrist Dr. Pollard, Andrew Airlie!",The Crush

I like how she is so evil in this, she does remind you of the movie 'Serial mom' which was out a few years after this movie. I suppose that movie pretty much copied this movie, instead of having a young girl being the devil, the mum could be too lol! I do wish that her character and Cary Elwes' were hooked up together in the end because they did make such a couple!

17,insomniac_rod,Sex sold successfully this Thriller.,5,28 June 2009,"What could be more attractive than a movie about a super sexy blonde babe who was the sex fantasy of thousands blackmailing a mature man? Well ""The Crush"" is not all about an obsessive teenager; it deals with the problems of a sexy teenager and how family is always necessary in order to define a teens' personality.But the lesson in this movie is that obsessions can be deadly, dangerous, and even sexy.Alicia Silverstone carries the movie entirely on her back showing sexy lingerie, bikinis, skimpy mini skirts, and even dirty dialog.She's the main attractive of the movie and face it, without her, the movie would suck even more.Overall this is a decent early 90's Thriller.",The Crush
18,videorama-759-859391,Talk about obsessed,8,22 July 2016,"I steered away from this movie, cause I got sick and tired of these Fatal Attraction, Single White Female movies. When finally deciding to watch it, I was glad I did. It was one of those movies, I wanted to bop myself on the head for not watching earlier. It's other attribute was short lived star, Silverstone, as the troubled 14 year old lolita, who falls for new renter, Elwes, a journalist, twice her age, and not good so with words, but impeccable, with facts, as his new boss tells him,in words to that effect. One not innocent lingering kiss between him and Silverstone, starts off a another Fatal Attraction type nightmare. Elwes, should of stopped this, before the kiss, where Silverstone did sucker him into this little romantic drive. But if he had done the proper thing, Silverstone still would of been stalking him. Nick (Elwes) a real good character actor, who does his role justice, wasn't really out of line, with improper conduct before this, though. Darian (Silverstone who's just the acting drive in this) isn't a very well girl, and had fixated on someone else in her earlier, with a not so happy result for her victim. She really only has one girl friend, where at school, as she refers, they look at her like some kind of freak. So we can see what her problems are, and why she is vying for this sort of attention. There are moments where we really feel sorry for her, especially at the end, where she's placed back in psyche ward, the fixation on Nick, undying, and then it's a new one, so we see a pattern. Silverstone's wonderful, if magnetic performance is half the reason to watch the film, utterly believable and scary as this obsessed teen with a crush so bad, it's frightening. Her obsession isn't helped with Elwes's work colleague, Amy (Jennifer Rubin- Bad Dreams) is now going with him, really putting a spanner in her works. Anyone who's comes between the victim's obsessed love, pays, and I don't really feel about wasps. They sting. This little cute nifty thriller, that didn't have a cinema release in Adelaide, really runs nicely, with Silverstone just making Elwes life a nightmare, which we hope he will come out on top. Him punching Alicia off a portable merry go round, stored up in her attic, is an amusing tic of a moment. If anything, these movies have taught us, be careful in the starting of friendships, and don't lead the other person on, who could just happen to be a would be psycho.",The Crush
19,GOWBTW,"A weak version of ""Fatal Attraction""",2,7 May 2003,"This movie is like the modernized version of ""Lolita"" with a touch of ""Fatal Attraction"". Unlike ""Lolita"" this was more of the reversed side of the story when the guy is the juvenile's obsession. That would make any level headed guy squirm. I know it can be fun to be idolized, but this is really scary.Mothers always warn their son's about girls much younger than they are. They should take the precaution seriously. This character fooled everyone around her including her folks who were too blind to see what was going on with her.It was OK to me, but others would like this movie in their favor. Just think,all the way through, Darian just wouldn't leave Nick ALONE! Rating 2 out of 5 stars!!!",The Crush
20,generationofswine,An Honest Review,10,22 February 2020,"It came out in '93 when I was 13 and seriously got addicted to the moody mystery thrillers. I mean, I grew up in a house that fostered a love for pulp fiction novels, Sabitini, Leonard, Howard, Hammett, and these movies kind of fall right into those novels.And this had a great cast, Elwes, Silverstone, Rubin, so the film was cast in a way that it could save whatever trash the script was lacking in.And in this case it's plot turns and mystery that it's lacking. The story itself is honestly pretty boring. And I don't fault anyone that objects to that.However, it has enough tension to really enjoy it. The acting is great. It really sets the mood in the right places. It's only when it comes down to the script itself where it fails, and even then the premise is interesting if it were done better.",The Crush

But Alicia's definitely left her mark on 90's movie Nostalgia & her performance here in ""Crush"" is excellent, especially considering her young age & the content & story!!! This film probably would get made today or if it did it would be a brutal & bloody revenge type of flick.Carey Elwes (Saw) gives an intense performance in his role as the unlucky journalist Nick, who rents & moves into a beautiful little apartment in the guesthouse of a wealthy couple & their weird teenage daughter. Silverstone is young & has a huge Crush on her new neighbour & becomes obsessed with him but the silly guy is so mellow & too nice that he walks into her trap & even stupidly kisses her!!! The guy is in his late 20's & she is only 14!!! Terrifying stuff & the movie gets gripping as hell as she starts Messing with his life & his new important job as a big journalist & it's so scary how it escalates. Nick makes stupid mistakes by being too friendly with her & gets himself in ridiculous situations that makes him look like a pedo pervert!!! He's stupid but it all makes for a really engrossing & suspenseful Thriller & i just love the 90's Thriller genre from the music to the clothes to look & cinematography, films were made better & have a richer feel & look to them that can't be matched today. Everything about this film is quality & it's very well crafted to be an intense experience like the 80's Classic Thriller FATAL ATTRACTION.I was super impressed with this sweaty, panicky & scary situation Thriller & am glad I've finally seen it.",The Crush
22,MarieGabrielle,It fills a void...,6,1 May 2007,"In the early 90's there was a marked scarcity of movie material for drama suspense. It seems the industry was experimenting. This was after ""Fatal Attraction"", ""Silence of the Lambs"" was a blockbuster, so apparently producers were trying similar genres. Now we have ""Swimfan"" and a new supply of similar themes for the newer viewers.Alicia Silverstone is believable, she attempts to add some character to the film. Elwes, while acceptable, is scarcely superior, as the befuddled and harassed tenant. Amy (Silverstone) lives in a Tudor mansion, keys Nicks car, gets him to take her on a drive, etc. She is 14 he is 28. Hardly an earth-shattering premise for two hours of film to be created.The carousel project her father has in the attic is a metaphor. We have seen it before. Her father and mother seem to be cardboard figures, representative of some establishment; this is never clearly manifested in the film. There are worse movies about obsession and psychosis. An old Hollywood standby. 7/10.",The Crush
23,caspian1978,"Modern Day ""Lolita"" Thriller",7,3 August 2002,"It has been about ten years since I watched the 2 minute preview to the Crush when it was available to purchase on my cable ""Request"" station. Although it has been ten years, and I have watched the movie a few times since its premiere, I have yet to see the version, or the director's cut that included the ""pool"" scene which many people argue exist. In the 2 minute coming attraction, there was a small 2 second clip of Alicia Silverstone and Cary Elwes splashing in the neighbors pool. This scene is never shown in any version. If you recall, Cary Elwes does ask Alicia Silverstone about the neighbors pool, but the conversation goes nowhere as it cuts from that scene to the very next day. In my opinion, I feel that the original version had the Cary Elwes character joining Darian for a midnight skinny dip as friends. I believe it was later cut out to give Cary's character more sympathy as Darian becomes more and more crazy. Having left the scene in would do less for the Cary Elwes role as the innocent victim and more or a single male up to no good.Please respond back if you remember seeing this small clip in the original coming attraction. I want to make sure I didn't dream this up or that I may be losing my mind.",The Crush
24,triple8,Just when one thought they'd seen it all.....,4,4 December 2005,"SPOILERS THROUGH:I have seen many movies in the ""stalker genre"" and for the most part most of them are not very good. That's usually due to the fact that they all follow the same storyline almost verbatim. The Crush was one I'd heard about but not seen and recently had the viewing pleasure.My thoughts On this one are pretty non complex. This is a ""stalker genre"" movie that follows many of the same familiar twists and turns and which isn't really very good but which is more watchable then some of the other stalker movies. That is due mainly to two things. One is the dialog. It has been commented on how really out there the dialog is and that's true but that is precisely what makes the movie at all memorable. Every so often there would be a line that was just so unbelievable I would just have to chuckle. And the character of Nick seemed to get a lot of those lines....Second is the casting of Alicia Silverstone. I have to admit, mediocre movie or not, She was really very good and managed to created a memorable character. There are other movies of this type I have watched including Poison Ivy, single white female and most recently Swim Fan and though none of them are very good, and though this isn't really very good either, it's better then the above mentioned three. Silverstone actually gives her character a personalty and makes her believable though she hardly looks fourteen! The story line however was the same as so many others though this was, believe it or not, less violent then many of it's genre so that's a plus. I will say that this isn't a 1 or 2 and it IS watchable though I do wish just once or twice a movie in this category would come out and be a bit different. Probably though, people who like movies of this type and haven't checked this one out, should because it's better then some of the others they may have checked out. At any rate- my vote's 4 of 10.",The Crush
25,DeeNine-2,A Lolita from hell,4,28 March 2007,"This was Alicia Silverstone's debut film after which she went on to star in some Aerosmith videos (what red-blooded American male can ever forget seeing her and Liv Tyler in ""Crazy""?) after which she got the lead in Clueless (1995) and the rest is cinematic history.In Clueless of course she was a sweet, adorable and slightly empty-headed Valley Girl. Here she is what might be called a Lolita from hell. Director Alan Shapiro even has her do a Sue Lyon (from Kubrick's 1964 Lolita) looking-over-her-sunglasses imitation to start the film. We soon learn that she is 14 ""almost 15."" (Silverstone was actually 15-years-old during the filming.) She is also rich and very talented, plays a classical piano, knows the scientific names of beetles and wasps, has skipped two grades, etc. The film itself might be dubbed a kind of ""Fatal Attraction"" for teeny-boppers.Cary Elwes plays Nick Eliot who is looking for some digs as the film begins. He is a writer who just got a gig with an important, trendy magazine. After nearly bumping into Adrian (Silverstone) with his car, he looks askance and sees a sign advertising a cottage for rent in back of a large house with estate. Turns out this is where Adrian lives with her parents.Somehow this reminds me of William Holden as the writer Joe Gillis pulling into that driveway on Sunset Boulevard (1950). He should have looked in the other direction! He should have run the other way! When Little Miss Crazy gets a crush, it is a hum-dinger. Maybe Nick should have just surrendered at the start and she would have been bored with him in a couple of months at most. But unfortunately, Nick Eliot is the epitome of the clueless male. He doesn't see the danger until it is too late. He is slightly compromised because he has kissed her, he has wandered about her house when her parents haven't been at home, and worse yet he doesn't have an inkling of the strength of her passion. To be honest I felt a little sorry for her having to deal with all that rejection! I think this would have played more realistically had Adrian's part been given to an ugly little shrew in the making. But then of course the film would not have found any kind of audience.Well, this is a familiar premise and the kind I like to see worked out and resolved--well, I like to look at Alicia, anyway. Unfortunately Alan Shapiro, who also wrote the script, has the originality of a photocopy machine and just milks the premise while mindlessly escalating the bizarro. Suffice it to say that Little Miss Crazy doesn't take no for an answer and that Nick stupidly behaves in a way that just makes his situation worse. The ending does have the virtue of being nicely ironic while suggesting the hoped-for sequel.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!)",The Crush
26,Pumpkin_Man,Better Than Expected!!!,8,20 October 2011,"I watched this earlier today, and it was actually a very decent psychological thriller. Alicia Silverstone's acting as the psychopathic, but pretty Adrian was amazing. She was my favorite character. She begins a seemingly harmless crush for her new neighbor, Nick, played by Cary Elwes. Adrian is just a teenager of 14, but Nick is 28, and she forces herself on him. She soon starts stalking him, calls and leaves him 98 messages on the answering machine, abuses herself and blames it on Nick. Can Nick prove his innocence and show that Adrian is truly crazy? Alicia Silverstone was so perfect for this role. I absolutely loved her performance. I would definitely recommend THE CRUSH!!!",The Crush
27,RonellSowes,Formulaic But Decent,4,3 April 2021,"The most common and prominent criticism of this film is probably how formulaic and predictable it is. It's one that I and seemingly most others would assign to this film. It's so contrived that you feel as certain about knowing its direction as if you had seen it before.However, while you may know how it will play out the actual execution is still adequately entertaining. Probably the main reason the film works is because it gets past its main obstacle-making a substantial villain of a 14 year old girl. Alicia Silverstone is thoroughly convincing as this psychotic character.Many might utterly slam this film because of derivative style, which is a veracious critique. But does that necessarily mean this is a terrible film? I wouldn't say so. The Crush is a movie you've seen before just under a different name.",The Crush
28,emm,"As the height of suspense draws closer, the excitement falters",5,11 December 1999,"Nick moves into the neighborhood until 14-year old girl Darian becomes strongly infatuated with him, and takes the consequences. Silverstone, in her first major film vehicle, proves sensitively capable for her young age in this uninteresting thriller that inheritedly reverses the gender frame when it comes to natural suspense. The compelling premise that tries to aim for Hitchcock discouragingly wears thin after the first run-through, and a shallow distinction is all that's left.RATING: * *",The Crush
29,eibon09,Suspenseless Film,3,20 April 2000,"The trouble with this feature is it has the feel and look of a made for TV movie.  It steals from almost every stalker movie without being energetic or entertaining.  The Crush(1993) is a ""violent"" film minus any substancial violence.  This is the only time that I can remember where the stalker does not get killed.  Alicia Silverstone at times overacts, but does a decent job overall.  The director seems to be going through the motions with this film. Its a bad mixture of Fatal Attraction(1987) & Lolita(1962).  Cary Elwes does a bad job as Nick Elliot as his character behaves like a fool and a sap.

We even find out that a long time ago, the same thing happened when Darian found an older guy and she even poisoned him and he died. The end of the film leaves us to believe that after Darian is sent to a special home, where she has to stay until she gets better, she has her eyes set on yet another new guy. Once again he's about the same age as Nick and he's a  counsellor at this place she is staying at. The Crush is a great thriller with loads of suspense.

31,Beejerman,CHEER! - (7 stars out of 10),7,29 November 2019,"The stage curtains open ...""The Crush"", featuring Alicia Silverstone in her first starring role, is a fun bit of moviemaking. I never really pictured Cary Elwes in a thriller/suspense film, but he pulled it off well. This movie was formulaic of most suspense films in the early 90's with the ever present piano tickled keys and high string notes. It was a bit cookie cutter, but still a nice diversion.Our story starts when Nick Eliot (Elwes), a writer for a posh magazine, moves to Seattle and rents the guest house of the Forresters. Their 14-year-old daughter, Adrian (Silverstone), develops a crush on Nick and what starts out as harmless adolescent flirtation becomes much more serious and dangerous. Nick begins a romance with a co-worker named Amy, which only fuels the intense jealously of Adrian. Adrian's friend, Cheyenne, tries to warn Nick about her, but she has an accident before they can meet. The harder Nick tries to pull away from Adrian, the worse it becomes until the inevitable climactic finish.This really wasn't that bad of a film. It was a solid debut for Alicia Silverstone who showed that she had more than just charisma - she could act. I felt she pulled off the psychotic, obsessed teen well. Like any movie in this genre, there are some holes in the plot, but it's still very entertaining.I would recommend ""The Crush"". It doesn't hold up as well these days, but it is a fun revisit to days gone by. I like this one and have it in my own collection. It isn't what I would call a favorite, but when I'm in the mood for something that isn't too heavy and can bring a smile to my face, I'll watch it. 7 stars out of 10.",The Crush

35,vip-danii,A Chick-Flick To Laugh At (Not A Thriller),4,6 October 2016,"This wacky movie is so bad, it is actually somewhat entertaining. It is apparent from the very start that this is going to be an extremely stupid, lame chick-flick, but you're kind of obligated to watch to see just HOW dumb it's going to get. And it doesn't disappoint.Obviously, someone just pulled the script right out of their backside as it is hard to imagine a more unrealistic and unlikely sequence of events.Alicia Silverstone, however, is very good. She shines in her debut performance, despite the fact that she is playing a terribly-written character.The male lead was far less impressive. In fact, one of the worst performances I've seen lately. It really doesn't help matters that he's playing an annoyingly dumb 28-year old, who, in fact, doesn't look or act any older than Adrian. I did not feel any sympathy for Nick to be honest. He was neither charismatic, nor in any other way likable. A protagonist that leaves you indifferent (I'd say annoyed, actually)... not a good sign.As for the movie itself. Well, it was a trainwreck. An amateurish one at that. The recipe used for this movie was: ""Lolita"" plus ""Fatal Attraction"" minus all the thrills and suspense plus a healthy dose of ""lame"" multiplied my 10 equals ""The Crush"".Watch it as a comedy, not as a thriller. Then you'll probably enjoy it. Trust me, there are laughs to be had at the expense of the screenplay writer(s). Just when you think that it simply cannot get any dumber... it will surprise you!",The Crush
36,mattfrancis-03963,Good,7,3 August 2021,I liked the concept and the role Alicia plays isn't easy but she made this her own role dominate and excellent.

37,hcoursen,Silverstone is superb,7,20 January 2010,"I agree that Silverstone is superb as a combination of 'Lolita' and 'Bad Seed.' Her ability to play the innocent is brought off very well because she conveys a sense of really caring for Nick, within one field of her ambivalence. I do have some problems with the film. Perhaps foremost is Nick's inability to just get the hell out of there. He should have done that much sooner. Or -- was the film suggesting that his fascination with the Silverstone character is keeping him around? That the girl could rewrite Nick's story and improve it strained credulity. The film dropped Nick's professional issues almost completely about a third of the way through. We got no sense of the huge interview he pulled off. That the girl could convince doctors of the event she claimed even having planted evidence struck me as completely impossible. The ending involved a transition to surrealism that the film had not prepared for. It was as if the film were figuring out its stylistic and generic premises as it went along. Why can't filmmakers produce coherent finished products anymore? Is it in response to the post-modernist attack on 'thematic unity' or just plain sloppiness. This could have been a great film.",The Crush
38,mustican,Risky and Failed Attempt,5,20 December 2005,"One of those rare days I watch TV, I came across with The Crush. Nick, a journalist, is looking for an apartment in a town where he just moved to. He seems to find the ideal place. A spacious flat rented by a wealthy and seemingly normal family. Daughter of the family is Adrian. She is beautiful, talented and clever. She also has interest in Nick. It is not strange when a girl has interest in an older guy, in this case much older. However, Adrian is a bit different from the girls from her age. She knows what exactly she wants. It is not a smile, or a few flirtatious moment. She wants Nick to fall in love with her. That's the time Nick decides to stop this. Adrian is so dangerous that she does not mind harming people around her and Nick in order to re-win his heart and she is determined to do that in any costs. Okay, we know how dangerous a human being can be. But there are some moments when I thought it was too much. First, a highly qualified journalist writes a piece to be published then a 14 year old girl looks at it, makes a few changes and editor loves it after all those changes. Come on!! You must be kidding. Secondly, she is in Nick flat, knows all hidden corners. So, does she have a spare key? Or is Nick stupid enough to lock the door after what has been happening. Then, Adrian, locks Nick's girlfriend in the photo-editing room and sends all the wasps into the room from ventilation. Again, how does she find out whereabouts she lives. Basically, we have a villain who is 14 years old and victim is helpless. The only person he can get to believe him is his girlfriend. That takes a while too. Acting is average. Not known names as Alicia Silverstone was discovered after filming The Crush. Cary Elwes is always in average movies anyway such as The Shadow of The Vampire, Jungle Book.. I heard that this was a real life story which happened to the director Shapiro. In that case I would feel so sorry for him as he is involved with such a thing at first place and couldn't even pull it off to make it a better film. Well, just average. ** out of *****",The Crush
39,ElmStreetsLastBrat,"Not particularly great, but I love it!",6,26 February 2007,"1993's ""The Crush"" isn't a particularly great film, but I have loved this film ever since it first came out. I was a huge fan of Cary Elwes at the time and I just had to see this film because he was in it. And I loved it when I saw it and I still do. Alicia Silverstone was perfectly cast as the 14 year old Darian who develops a crush on Nick Eliot (Elwes), a struggling journalist who has just moved into her parents' guest house. At first Nick thinks it's just a little crush and that they're only friends. But once Nick finds a girlfriend Amy (Jennifer Rubin), Darian becomes enraged and tries to do away with Amy. And her crush becomes a deadly obsession. She calls Nick several times a day. Comes over to his house unexpectedly. Accuses him of rape and actually gets ahold of one of his used condoms! Which is totally sick. This film isn't scary or frightening, but it does have some creepy and tense moments. One of the most frightening scenes to me was when Darian tried to kill Amy with bees. Amy is in the garage developing pictures and Darian pours dozens of bees into the room and Amy is unable to get out because the door is locked. And it shows Amy's hands and face covered in bees. That was the most frightening and somewhat disturbing scene in the film. Alicia Silverstone was brilliant as Darian in her film debut. She was unbelievably creepy. Cary Elwes was average as Nick Eliot. He's a good actor but he usually chooses roles that don't showcase how much talent he actually has and this was one of those films. You weren't able to feel any sympathy for him because Nick kind of led Darian on. But he was so handsome in this film I thought. This is the film he has looked his best in. Kurtwood Smith was great in a supporting role as Darian's overprotective father. This film isn't award material and is in no way great but it is still highly entertaining and has a couple of edge-of-your-seat moments. I'm glad I have it in my collection.

40,vocklabruck,Good thriller but not original AT ALL,4,23 December 2007,"The idea was good, the problem is that this idea was taken from other movies. This movie was a mix between Fatal Attraction (1987) and Poison Ivy (1992).I liked the acting very much. I don't like Alicia Silverstone but she was outstanding, especially if you have in count this was her first movie. Maybe a little over the top at times.The plot had some problems but I will not list all that here. I will just mention one thing: if the guy was so uncomfortable being stalked by that girl why didn't he leave? This guy was goddamn stupid!It is a good thriller and it gives you the chills a couple times. Probably I have a negative feeling because the day before I watched Poison Ivy with a quite similar story (a developed evil teenager getting a crush on an older man).

Whoever did the casting for this movie sure crushed it! Cary Elwes is so likeable and loveable, and Alicia Silverstone is pure gold. I love her in Clueless and Batman, but she really slays it in this movie.This is basically a story about when a young girl falls for an older man and things go sideways. I guess nowadays this movie doesn't make much sense from the lens of #metoo... instead of the older man being the monster it's the young female. Some people would say that Cary Elwe's character acted like an idiot, but these were much simpler times when people were nice and didn't want to be rude, unlike today. If anyone was stupid, it was Alicia Silverstone's character; she could have ended up with her feet sawed off chained to a bedpost in some remote cabin.This is definitely worth the watch if you haven't seen it before.

On the one hand, by the end I thought it was getting really psycho and like I don't know if maybe it was a little over the top. It's hard to say. It's hard for me to rate it. I liked the movie quite a bit. I don't know who to recommend it to. It's not a romantic movie after all. After a while, it gets to be quite a massacre.

You might end up drooling your food on the floor. Nick isn't that smart but I like him because he's nobody's fool.

51,nkfilms,People who aren't Alicia fans may slag this. Fatal Attraction with a fourteen year old.,6,11 July 2006,"I bought this today in a previously enjoyed bin at Blockbuster. It set me back five bucks, so I figured since I like Alicia, this would be worthwhile for my guilty pleasure collection I've been building up over the years (Included in that collection is Excess Baggage, the film that made me get a huge crush on Alicia). Considering the money spent, this is great popcorn. When buying this I expected a pseudo update of Fatal Attraction, which in so many words, was. (spare me if I offend some for making that comparison) The Crush is a campy, but dark story. Alicia plays a very convincing 14 year old obsessive compulsive psychopathic teenager who is experiencing love. I really thought she did well, I know she has limitations - but it's a totally unbiased opinion. You'd never expect the girl from Clueless to say such lines like ""Hey Nick, ever do a virgin?"" - She portrays this very sexual presence, which works.My problem with the film is I guess I've sort of marked myself as a fan of the Alicia who plays sweet characters, so it's kind of a knock back. Other than that - If not taken seriously it would make a good film to throw on if you like Alicia, if not, could still be a decent thriller movie to watch with a couple beers or if you just want to throw on a guilty pleasure. It's campy, it's got some corn, but you gotta love it sometimes.",The Crush
52,Cinnamental,What adult man lets a teenage girl waltz around his home?,3,9 July 2019,"The film is cliche and predictable. The main character is supposedly a world wise journalist. He lets a teenage girl come in and out of his home as she pleases and entertains her flirtatious nature with him. Another reviewer said that since Alicia Silverstone ""was older than 14 in real life"" it's ok to call her sexy. Well, she was 15 when this was filmed. If you're an adult male viewer who thinks she's sexy as a 15 year old child, you're wacked in the head.",The Crush
53,megaphilip,Pretty cool,6,10 June 2004,"This movie was pretty well made, it's not the best though. The idea is veryoriginal. Alicia Silverstone did an amazing job with her acting. Alicia is very talented and has acted in a lot of other really good movies. I thought this thriller was very exciting and cool. When I started this movie (spoiler ahead) I was 99% sure the man would be the freak, but Silverstone was. He king of looks a little like a freak. When I saw the DVD in the shop (tower records) I read something on the front and it said. ""He thought it was just a crush, he was dead wrong."" That is such a catchy sentence, that made me buy it because of that. That 'dead' part caught my attention. When I started the movie, I was so into it that I didn't even want to go to the bathroom.",The Crush
54,nathanburke-88780,A decent film about obsession featuring a young gorgeous Alicia Silverstone.,7,19 June 2018,The film that probably got Alicia Silverstone noticed by Hollywood The Crush is a new take on the young teenage being obsessed with an older man. Cary Elwes is alright though he doesn't have much to do but Silverstone is pretty good- It is strange to see her absent lately as she clearly has that star factor going for her. Go see it for her.,The Crush
55,YukonAurora,A camp classic,6,5 July 2001,"A true Camp Classic.Tawdry and Tacky.Yet,this film does generate some very good suspense,to the point of even some discomfort to the viewer. Particulary,in respect to some of the conversation's that Darien has with the other characters in the film. Alicia Silverstone's acting is very good in this film,definitely a promising debut. Cary elwes character can be a bit annoying...you'll have to suspend some disbelief there. The Direction of the film is steady and fast paced.",The Crush
56,kw_art,Ok-ish,5,5 August 2021,"After reading mixed reviews on this, I decided to give it a watch myself. It is cringy in a lot of parts to say the least. Yes she is bat s*** crazy, but he is just an idiot! He kept getting into situations he didn't have to!Oh and for all the creepy men saying ""how hot Alicia is"" she is depicting a 14 year old girl! Eew. You are the type of men that end up saying ""well officer, she told me she was 19!""",The Crush
57,Avatarman614,"Goes by the film school rule book, clichéd as all hell. But surprisingly a guilty pleasure.",8,8 September 2014,"I watched The Crush (1993) because it was recommended to me on the page for Poison Ivy (1992). Being a fan of obsession based psychological thrillers, if only as guilty pleasures, I had to watch this. It didn't disappoint. The writing, story and characters at the most cliché I've ever seen them. The obsession story was handled well and it made way more sense that Poison Ivy. The basis of the obsession can be explained but there isn't any character development to shine any light on why Adrian (Alicia Silverstone) is like she is. Cary Elwes puts on another bad American accent sounding almost identical to how he did in Saw (2004). In some way you could link those two films together as a joke. The film itself is pretty bad but it's entertaining and well worth the 1hr 20mins it takes up.Final Verdict 8 out of 10 Not a bad film but so clichéd it's hilarious.",The Crush

Nick Elliot comes to town starting a new job as a journalist - looking for a quiet place to stay , it is the guest house of Darian's residence and almost immediately Darian becomes clingy. Nick , who is twice her age thinks nothing of it but after a brief kiss on the pier Darian has set her mind on him. It turns into a cat and mouse game where Darian attacks Nick's girlfriend and even accuses him of rape.

60,19460Stratford,Seriously fun entertainment!,10,14 November 1999,"Alternating between gothic horror and hilarious camp, ""The Crush"" is one of the great cult films.  Writer/Director Alan Shapiro's young discovery, Alicia Silverstone, delivers her greatest role to date -- no kidding.  This is pure fun entertainment, I highly recommend renting it.  I will see anything writer/director Alan Shapiro makes.",The Crush
61,http://www.angelfire.com/ok3/MoneyNow,Alicia Silverstone shines in this teenage drama,8,7 April 2000,"It's very hard to understand why this movie is rated so low. I really enjoyed watching this film, which was Silverstone's first major role. She plays a crazy teenager who has a crush on a guy who lives in a guesthouse. In her selfish pursuit of the object of her affection, she makes the guy's life a living hell. She also makes the life miserable for anyone who tries to ""steal"" the guy from her. I think Silverstone fit her role perfectly. The plot was very good as well, and I was always wondering what Silversone's character (Alicia) would do next. This movie gets a solid 8 from me.",The Crush
62,R_Burgos2000,One of my favorites!,10,27 April 2002,"THE CRUSH has it all; a great cast,director, and common sense. The film is so good it actually saves itself from being the usual teenage obsession movie like THE PAPERBOY. The story centers around Nick Eliot, journalist who rents a house in the backyard of the happily married Forrester couple. And their daughter Adrian (A.K.A. ""Darian"" in older VHS releases). Adrian is not like most girls. She's 14 and very wise for her age. He instantly becomes an obsession for her. She buys him things and tries to seduce him very sleekfully. He tells her many times that he doesn't want that kind of relationship. After a memorable  public fight she decides to get deadly revenge. The ending shows that it isn't over with her loved on.",The Crush
63,R_Burgos2000,My Favorite Movie of All Time,10,24 October 2003,"""The Crush"" stars Cary Elwes as Nick Eliot, a 28-year old journalist who has just moved to Seattle and got a new job at Pique magazine. He moves into the guest house of the Forresters: Husband/Father Cliff (Kurtwood Smith), Wife/mother Liv (Gwynwyth Walsh) and 14 year old Darian (Alicia Silverstone). Nick gets along with the family well and they all like him. Especially young Darian who has a crush on him. Darian follows him around and when she finds out he is dating co-worker Amy Maddik (Jennifer Rubin) she fights for a man she cannot have. Her friend Cheyenne (Amber Benson) knows that Darian has had a violent past ending up with a murder of the crush and ends up in one of Darian's planned ""accidents"" After a violent attack on Amy and an accused rape, Darian is taken away by her parents but of course, scorned, she escapes trying one last time to get Nick. And if he doesn't accept it means death.The performances in ""The Crush"" are really believable. Darian is a 14-year-old and is treated that way. If she is hurt or falls, you know she won't get back up again with a 1000 lives. The plot gets you thinking and the movie doesn't treat the viewer as an idiot and take easy way outs. I liked that. ""The Crush"" runs a full 89 minutes and at a quick pace, it's just the kind of movie you can get into before bed or while eating your dinner.4 out of 4 stars. ""I highly suggest you check this movie out.""",The Crush
64,Hemiola_78,PC review,7,20 August 2017,"Like most teenagers in the early/mid 90's it was pretty hard to dislike (or at least ignore) Alicia Silverstone. This movie in particular was advertised on TV for weeks on end in the summer of 93, often enough to remember it nearly 25 years after. I never watched 'The Crush' as a teenager though, which might have been a good thing. When I finally did last week, I couldn't quite understand the fuss it generated upon its release (other than being Alicia's first major role), nor can I explain the amount of criticism it has gathered since. For the most part the main characters (especially the journalist) are somewhat implausible, and the story focuses on depicting her increasingly violent outbursts rather than motivation or inner conflicts. But make no mistake, Alicia is more than convincing as a 14 years old Lolita from hell, being at various times sweet, fragile, manipulative, precocious, overtly sexual, and creepy. The story might not be the most unpredictable you've come across, but it's engaging enough to keep you interested. A significant number of reviews seem to focus on the difference between certain attitudes and production values between early 90's and now rather than the movie itself. Some even go as far as accusing Alan Shapiro of featuring soft core child pornography. I'm curious if the same criticism is leveled against Zeffirelli's 'Romeo and Juliet', for depicting a 14-year old Olivia Hussey (not an older body double) in an even more revealing scene. I guess the weakest point of the movie is the implausibility of the story and of the male character. We know how Adrian and Nick end up being neighbors, but no explanation is given for Adrian being left alone with an adult so frequently. The early 90's might have been more innocent and relaxed times, but not that innocent! As for Nick, he crosses the line so many times we can't decently view him as a victim in the end. It's unclear if he refuses Adrian's advances because he's intimidated/overwhelmed or because they are inappropriate. Indeed, if it wasn't for Amy raising the alarm early on, one wonders how far would Nick have pursued the 'frienship' with Adrian (some scenes which didn't make the DVD cut show Adrian & Nick enjoying a night swim, going for a ride in Nick's car, etc). Take this movie for what it is: not the best erotic thriller of the 90's, perhaps not even Oscar material, but definitely not a trashy, laughable, and exploitative flick either.",The Crush
65,ExtensiveEnterprises,A Good Thriller from the Early 90's,5,7 February 2006,"Alicia Silverstone's first movie that made her a new name and face in Hollywood in the early 90's. The Crush, staring Carry Elwes (The Bride, Bram Stroker's Dracula), Jennifer Rubin (A Nightmare on Elm St.3), Alicia Silverstone and Kurtwood Smith (That 70's Show,Star Trek VI) about a 14 year old girl (Silverstone) insanely obsessed with a magazine writer (Elwes) who just moved into her parents apartment above their garage. Her obsession for Nick grows deadly as her pushes off her advances. A thriller of the 90's that made people cheer for Elwes and fear,but still love Silverstone.If you wanna enjoy a movie with same theme of Fatal Attraction,but with a age difference then check out The Crush. I still enjoy seeing the movie on TV whenever its on. Silverstone's twisted smile with stay with you until the very end. This movie has had its share of competitors, Fear and Swimfan, but nothing is more as popular as The Crush.Still is the best of Alicia Silverstone's films next to Clueless.",The Crush
66,Ogdred_Weary,Hilarious,2,20 September 2003,"I love bad movies on tv. Currently playing on my TV is ""The Crush"" starring Cary Elwes and Alicia Silverstone. She's a psychotic 14 year old stalker, he's the attractive guy made to look dopey with big dumb glasses and bad hair who is renting the summer house behind her parent's place. Silverstone plays Darian ""Adrian,"" who is one of those villains who manages to know and see everything and be everywhere at exactly the right time. For example, Nick's (Elwes) girlfriend walks in the woods to find sticks and Adrian is there. I wonder how long she had been there, hoping to find her and frighten her with her terrifying knowledge of wasps?And Nick is the kind of ""hero"" who does what the plot demands so that Adrian can trap him before the end. At one point, I gave up on him entirely as a hopeless dork who deserved what Adrian put him through. He actually goes into her home when it is empty to look for a photo he thinks she has taken. He then walks into her bedroom -- will it be empty for long? Is he the dumbest man to walk the earth? Maybe. After all, he has new locks installed, determines to move out, then has sex with his girlfriend in the summer house where he KNOWS Adrian can get to him, and leaves the door unlocked. Yeah. I can't help watching these wretched movies. Loved it.Beware the wasps...they attack in groups....",The Crush
67,hill79,Constant hyper sexualisation of a minor. Awful.,1,30 August 2021,"Alicia Silverstone may have been 16 when this was made, but her character is supposed to be 14 (""nearly 15""). There are repeated 'sexy' shots of her in swimwear, underwear, up skirt scenes on a swing and at one point nude (though you don't see more than a body-doubles bottom). Cary Elwes character is portrayed as struggling with his conscience over her age rather than shutting down her advances right away as he should, he displays some very questionable responses to Silverstone's advances, kissing her and spying on her naked from inside a cupboard. He's displaying actions boarding on paedophilia but he's supposed to be the hero of the story. The way the whole thing is presented feels like the grubby fantasy of a creepy Hollywood director and it's very uncomfortable to watch.",The Crush
68,ehlenahunter,I Liked It!,6,6 July 2017,"After all these years, who doesn't know the premise of this movie? It's about a mentally unstable 14-year-old who becomes obsessed with a grown man renting a room on her parents property. She even goes so far as to try to ruin his career, life, and freedom when he doesn't return her advances.I saw this movie many years ago and I liked it. In fact, all these years later I can see where this movie set a precedence for other teenage ""obsession"" movies within this genre. But, oh yes, there is a BUT. After viewing it all these years later, I can safely say that Nick (Cary Elwes) did indeed lead Adrian on. As a grown man, he did some inappropriate things that put him in this position with Adrian. That's not to say that she still wouldn't have become mentally unhinged, but his relationship with her was far from amicable from the beginning. The constant leering at her in her bikini, following her on the balcony and flirting with her, taking her on moonlit drives at night, kissing her under the lighthouse, and sneaking into her parents house without making his presence known and peeping at her through her closet door. Granted, I know he was looking for some items he thought she stole, but still. None of that makes Nick come out of this clean, in my opinion.Did he deserve what he got? I think so! All besides the rape allegations. I saw that coming a mile away, and he should have too, which is why he should have known that all personal contact with a female minor should have been kept to a minimum.All in all, I did like this movie, and I did like Alicia Silverstone in it. It's just too bad she didn't get a chance to take her career further. What ever happened to her anyway?",The Crush
69,Mr.Fiber,"Thrilling movie, yet so real",8,30 January 1999,A very thrilling movie with Alicia Silverstone playing a very smart girl. There's some connection with the movie Blown Away (1993). In both movies there's a young girl who has something in mind who is desperate to achieve that. I liked the plot. It shows how helpless you can be when nobody believes you and somebody is playing a trick with you. Just like how it could happen in real life.,The Crush
70,derangedfangirl-1,I actually quite enjoyed this,7,14 October 2007,"I really enjoyed this movie, especially the DVD version. I'm currently watching it for the second time, and, the nuances of Nick's character are very very interesting. Nick is not, contrary to how his actions could be construed, an absolute idiot... In many ways, particularly in the beginning, Nick seems to allow himself to be manipulated by Adrian, and on some level, he IS physically attracted to her. His character is not quite as obvious as I thought originally. Also, I (unlike some other viewers) didn't find Adrian's character to be completely unbelievable (perhaps because I'm a teenage girl, and I know how evil we can be. *snickers* There's not an age requirement to be a sociopath.) Secondly, Cary Elwes. Admittedly, this character as written, has little depth beyond that of the victim, and although he played the role very well ,(his delivery was what kept the character from being TOTALLY boring)the plot line was simply too obvious... There weren't any plot twists, which kept the film from being truly suspenseful beyond the whole ""WTF??? You IDIOT!!! Can't you see she's EVIL?!? Alicia Silverstone's performance was pretty good... but not incredible. I feel that she could have done much more with the role and keeping her character a little more mysterious... As played, it doesn't make much sense that Nick wouldn't have known what was going on earlier.Yeah. Honestly, this plot would have been much more interesting if Nick's character had been less predictable and more flawed, and Adrian had been less obvious. Nonetheless, this is quite an enjoyable flick if for no other reason than to analyze Nick's character and watch Cary Elwes' interesting delivery....Just a small question; Does anyone else think that this is part of what made him decide to start playing the ""evil"" roles?",The Crush

There is no reason a 28 year old should be ""friends"" with a 14 year old. He kisses her, watches her undress, and spends quality time with her alone. The fact that the child is portrayed as the villain when it's clearly the grown man is so gross to me.

74,brutalhoney,Beautiful Bumblings of a Blooming Betty,10,19 February 2002,"This is every teenage girls dream come true, and every 30-something man's worst nightmare, maybeImagine an incredibly attractive, intriguing, intelligent man moves in partially in your lap. Is it not natural for you to fall deeply, madly, insanely in love with him? Not quite. That is where the suspense is. You can't help but wonder, ""Darian, your already unbalanced. We get that. But how far can you go with this?"" Well, apparently, FAR ENOUGH.
But what if you're the 30-something man who just happens to innocently rent an apartment in the backyard of a very ""well-endowed"" young woman? Would you not be a little interested? Of course you would be. But that feeling turns into complete panic when she unravels into a complete psychopath who is out to love you, or is out to get you. Either way, you lose.
This is one of those movies that many love to hate, and the rest just love to love. ""The Crush"" leaves you hanging off your seat in a one-arm grip waiting for it all to unfold.Relatively new to the movie making scene, Alicia Silverstone pulls off the psychopath part off brilliantly. Cary Elwes, a well-established actor by this time, hadden't perfected his 'American' accent yet, but you have to admit, he still is endearing. In this movie, you can cut his repressed sexual tension with a knife.This entire movie reminds me of that one song, ""Loving you, is easy because your beautiful...la la la la la....""

I was overall left disgusted by this film.I hope it's one of those films that you have to watch a couple of times before you get into it but i doubt it as i have now completed my third viewing.Alicias acting was pretty good for he age i think she was about sixteen or seventeen.

76,akhila-52166,Shouldn't be taken seriously,7,15 February 2016,"I didn't understand all the negative reviews of the Crush. People want to look at this like it should be realistic, yet it isn't intended to be. It is just your average teen horror fare. The film is about a girl named Darian (or Adrian, whichever you prefer) who meets a handsome older 30 year old Nick Elliot (Cary Elwes) and gets an unhealthy, creepy obsession with him. Darian (played by Alicia Silverstone) is a talented and attractive 14 year old girl who is vulnerable and awkward in her struggles to make friends. Eventually Darian becomes a huge burden and does major damage to Nick's livelihood, causing him to get arrested on suspicion of statutory rape and losing his job. Things work out in the end though serendipitously by some luck by chance.In my opinion, Alicia Silverstone did an excellent job in this movie. For only 16, she played the part well of an insecure teenager, balanced with the role of a young seductive siren trying to make Nick Elliot break the law. You could really see her talent as a young actress which rightfully sprung her into other roles like Clueless(1995), True Crime(1996) and Blast from the Past(1999). Cary Elwes was a lot less impressive with his role and his acting, but he did make a funny pairing with Alicia Silverstone. The movie has many comical and endearing parts to it. Some of it seems exaggerated and unbelievable, like the way he was arrested without proper evidence, the homeowners believing him to be a drug dealer, and him not bothering to call before showing up to their house! You will laugh at the absurdity of these situations most definitely. Overall, it's entertaining, not bad to check out, especially if you are a major Alicia Silverstone fan. It's not bad watching less serious stuff once in a while.",The Crush
