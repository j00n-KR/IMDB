0,TheLittleSongbird,A less than inspired return to Underland,4,1 June 2016,"2010's 'Alice in Wonderland', despite being a box-office hit, was very much a lesser Tim Burton (whose 80s and 90s outings were fantastic, especially 'Edward Scissorhands' and 'Ed Wood', but he became hit and miss after his career low-point 'Planet of the Apes') film.That is not to say that it was completely terrible, there were some great things like the beautiful visuals and some good performances, just that with the amount of talent there was it could have been much more with better execution of its story. Like 'Alice in Wonderland', its follow up this year's 'Alice Through the Looking Glass' is a very loose adaptation of the source material, where the only recognisable elements are the title, some of the characters and that Alice goes through a mirror, which will be of a disappointment for some.While there are people who think 'Alice Through the Looking Glass' is superior to 'Alice in Wonderland', there are also others who think 'Alice in Wonderland' is better. For this reviewer, there are things that are improved in 'Alice Through the Looking Glass' but the story in 'Alice in Wonderland' is less flawed (while still being so) and it uses its cast better.Starting with the good points and the improvements, 'Alice Through the Looking Glass' looks wonderful like its predecessor. It maintains the very bright and eye-poppingly colourful look of 'Alice in Wonderland', while at the same time giving a softer and at times darker look. The chronosphere and time travel effects are very well executed, and it's exquisitely filmed. The standout set design is Time's castle, and Time's costume also stands out for the costumes. After being unimpressed by her in 'Alice in Wonderland', Mia Waskikowska's acting as Alice has come on leaps and bounds. She speaks with more assertion and has much more expression in her face, the character also having more purpose and intent.There are also a few good performances, namely an imposing and menacing but also amusing and sincere Sacha Baron Cohen as Time, who often comes very close to stealing the film, and a deliciously over the top but also tragic Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen. There are a couple of good scenes, the opening scene is atmospheric and nail-biting and the scene in Time's castle is entertaining, visually stunning and has some suspense. Who cannot help love the seconds and minutes, they're adorable? Wilkins being one of those characters who does raise a chuckle but it's easy to feel a little pity for. The tea scene is sort of fun and has a rare sense of dread, but spoilt somewhat by going overboard with the time references and jokes.Danny Elfman's score has some nice moments, with some rousing and beautifully orchestrated and it at least fits. It is a very typical fantasy adventure score however, and it is one of Elfman's more forgettable efforts. Whereas many of his other outings (namely 'Edward Scissorhands' with the opening titles and ""the ice dance"") have at least one great and memorable track, this reviewer honestly struggled to remember anything from this. Most of the acting does not make an impression. Even when Mad Hatter is restrained and in torment Johnny Depp manages to try far too hard, his facial expressions constantly betray him wanting to go over the top and his voice bizarrely keeps going up and down with a slipping in and out accent and distracting lisp, this makes him come over as annoying which makes it far more difficult to engage with Alice's want to help him. On the other side of the spectrum Anne Hathaway looks completely lost, she looks beautiful but her performance has a lot of listless fluttery hand gestures and emotionless line delivery.Regarding everybody else, there is a lot of talent wasting here. Lindsay Duncan is compassionate but with little to do, but Geraldine James and Rhys Ifans are wasted and Leo Bill, even for a character meant to not be very nice, is punchably obnoxious. On the most part the voice cast are not used that well, with the most lines if remembered correctly coming from Paul Whitehouse, Matt Vogel and Timothy Spall (the first two's contributions entertain the most), though Alan Rickman in his final (posthumously) released film exudes authority and suavity even with very few lines. Despite noble efforts from Stephen Fry (once again purr-fect as the Cheshire Cat, but with not enough to do) and Barbara Windsor, their characters are too much in the background (true for most of Alice's friends) and the film couldn't have wasted Michael Sheen any more if it tried.Where 'Alice Through the Looking Glass' falls down most is in the script and story. Like 2014's 'Maleficent', Linda Woolverton's script is lazy with a lot of clichés, dumbness, very forced humour and too many strands not elaborated upon enough. The characters are bland and one-dimensional mostly with only Alice and Red Queen getting any half-way successful development (Mad Hatter would have been so as well if Depp's performance was better), and the voiced characters are too much in the background. While there is more going on here than in 'Alice in Wonderland', it's still by the numbers and without much heart or soul, with Carroll's kookiness, darkness, unique colour and sense of nonsense not much in sight. As a result of too many plot strands and the film leaving a lot of them half-baked with not given enough explanation (especially with the chronosphere and travels through time), the story is not easy to follow. The pacing is all over the map, with some rambling and drawn out parts (Alice's back story has more conflict and is marginally more interesting but take too much of the film up) and other parts feel rushed (much more time could have spent on the scenes when the film travels back in time).In conclusion, not a complete mess but less than inspired. 4/10 Bethany Cox",Alice Through the Looking Glass
1,Leofwine_draca,They shouldn't have bothered,3,22 April 2018,"You know your film's going to be bad when even Tim Burton doesn't come back to direct it, and this follow up to Burton's ALICE IN WONDERLAND is one of the most forgettable Hollywood blockbusters I've seen in a good while. I should note that it has nothing to do with the Lewis Carroll novel, instead mixing together a Wellsian time travel plot as Alice once more heads to Wonderland to rescue the Mad Hatter from a certain death. Right from the beginning, where we see Alice captaining her ship in a big CGI set-piece, I knew this film would be complete nonsense and so it proves. It's one of those slick CGI action adventures in which every single shot has to be packed with CGI landscape, imagery, and characters. The same old annoying characters return from the first film to annoy once more (hello, Helena Bonham Carter) while Mia Wasikowska seems to have mastered that single expressioned, mildly bored look. The story goes through cliche after cliche, merely showing off the latest work from the CGI animators rather than having any kind of real character or warmth of its own, and as such it is quite the bore.",Alice Through the Looking Glass
2,SnoopyStyle,another one,5,13 January 2017,"Alice Kingsleigh (Mia Wasikowska) is captaining her father's ship, The Wonder, escaping Malay pirates. She's a year late returning to London. Her father had died and her ruthless ex-fiancé Hamish Ascot has taken over. Her mother sold the family's shares. Hamish threatens to take The Wonder. Alice follows Absolem through the Looking Glass onto the other side. The Hatter (Johnny Depp) has gone darker and madder. He is haunted by memories of his family lost to the Jabberwocky. She has to get the Chronosphere from the hands of Time (Sacha Baron Cohen) and return to the past to save Hatter's family.Director James Bobin retrieves Tim Burton's wonderful visual excessiveness to churn out another Alice movie. Burton's movie is a jumbled sequel to Lewis Carroll's work whereas this one reinterprets it completely. The first one is no masterpiece of storytelling but at least, it has the fun of new invention of imagery. This one is no longer so new. Wasikowska's spunky innocence has turned into full fledged defiance against old-timey sexism. I actually like the attempt to find the origins of the sisters' rivalry but I don't like the execution. Sacha Baron Cohen's Time would probably work better as a supporting character. He's neither villain nor hero. Alice is more reckless than heroic. It needs more Red Queen's villainy to give Alice more heroism. The story needs more heart and gets washed out by its CGI action overload. There is an attempt here but it is unable to be good.",Alice Through the Looking Glass
3,mark.waltz,"Another evidence of a pretty film....a pretty mess, that is.",2,22 March 2017,"It's a shame that the estates of the writers of classic novels can't sue to prevent the assassination of their ancestor's work. Certainly, there have been revisals of classic books, plays and movies that worked, but more often than not, it's an insult to the memory of the creator. Looking like ""The Pirates of the Caribbean"" meets ""Downton Abbey"" as this begins, this is a beautiful block of ice that drips and drips until there's nothing but a puddle of colored slop left. Already too old in the first film (where we at least had the creativity of Tim Burton to admire if not the film as a whole), but here, it's under new hands, and the claws have torn apart whatever charm was there before.I am tired of the attempted manipulation of my emotions through special effects, computer animation and overly dramatic music that overpowers ordinary scenes and makes the emotional powerful scenes that needed less underscoring into head scratching tripe. Alice is nasty in her world, telling us she learned nothing, and the charm quickly fades even more when she flies through the mirror and opens that fateful door with the one long step. Her next stop? Nearly two hours of pretentious boredom disguised as art. Ugly in spirit in spite of how colorful it looks, it is completely unfaithful to the story, and for me, that is enough to dismiss it. I have seen several versions of ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" that knew just where to go and where to stop, and this comes to a dead end pretty much near the beginning. The Mad Hatter is not meant to be the protagonist of a story, just a brief stop in Alice's voyage to Wonderland in the first novel. He's not even a part of the second book. Only the rabbit is briefly seen. I've become convinced that Disney is on a secret agenda to manipulate its audiences through mind numbing dumbness and noise, and unlike Alice in the first book, will not know tow to the demands of a bottle to ""drink me"". Just one more piece of evidence that most movie makers have lost the real sense of what art is, not to mention disrespect to the artists of the past. It's started snowing in Hollywood, and the flakes are as large as the blue butterfly that sounds strangely like Professor Snape.",Alice Through the Looking Glass
4,nogodnomasters,Time is a thief and a villain,8,4 December 2017,"The film opens with an incredible scene as Alice (Mia Wasikowska) captain of ""The Wonder"" eludes Chinese pirates in the middle of a storm through the Straits of Malacca, 1874. She does 'the impossible"" something she likes to do ""six times before breakfast."" When she gets back to London her financial circumstances has taken a turn for the worst. She ends up back in Wonderland where she must go back in time in order to save Hatter Tarrant Hightopp, who believes his parents are alive, but who died. She meets Time (Sacha Baron Cohen), a kinder German version of Rasputin type of man who must endure a rash of puns.As the film progresses, only Alice can save all of time, space, and dimension and realizes you only have one family.This film lacked the action, scenes, drama, and adrenaline flow of the first one. Through the time travel sequences we obtain background information of the queens and why their relationship as sisters fell apart. It seems the Queen of Hearts didn't eat the tarts after all.Mia Wasikowska continues in her female role model, although not as strong as the first feature. These time travel things seldom work too well.",Alice Through the Looking Glass
5,kosmasp,Alice and the Mad Hatter,7,4 February 2017,"I guess if you do a sequel, do it about and around the two characters that will probably attract the most interest. So this time around, the one in trouble is the Hatter. Which is a nice touch, though I'm not sure there is any written part of this in the books. I also am only aware of the one Alice story we all know more or less and which got depicted in the first movie of course.For a sequel this was pretty good and the story was easy to follow. The effects are good too (generally speaking, not 3D). Of course since this is a fairy tale you kind of know where this is heading (no pun intended). Nice turn up by new folks like Sasha Baron Cohen too. All in all worth your time, especially if you liked the first one",Alice Through the Looking Glass
6,jboothmillard,Alice Through the Looking Glass,5,23 June 2016,"It was only when I saw a trailer for this Disney sequel that I did my research and found out Lewis Carroll did actually write a follow- up book to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, I was certainly interested to see it, produced by Tim Burton, directed by James Bobin (co-creator of Ali G, The Muppets). Basically Alice Kingsleigh (Mia Wasikowska) has spent the past three years sailing the high seas as a merchant ship captain, she returns from China to London, and learns her former fiancé Hamish Ascot (Leo Bill) has taken over her father's company, he plans to have Alice sell her father's ship, the Wonder, in exchange for her family home. Alice runs away angry, she recognises a blue butterfly as her former caterpillar friend Absolem (Alan Rickman, in his last film), she follows him through a mirror (the looking glass) and returns to Underland. Alice is greeted by Mirana the White Queen (Anne Hathaway), McTwisp the White Rabbit (Michael Sheen), Tweedledee and Tweedledum (Matt Lucas), Mallymkun the Dormouse (Dame Barbara Windsor), Bayard the Bloodhound (Timothy Spall) and the Cheshire Cat (Stephen Fry). They inform Alice that the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) is depressed, he has recalled his family during the attack of the Jabberwocky, this shortly occurred after the Hatter's father Zanik Hightopp (Rhys Ifans) seemed to reject his son's gift of his first hat creation, the Hatter, real name Tarrant Hightopp, found this creation recently and has been in poor health since. It is unsure if the Hatter's family survived, the White Queen believes finding them is the only way to restore his health, she persuades Alice to consult the powerful being Time (Sacha Baron Cohen), who rules over time in Underland, to travel back in time, something no resident of Underland can do without destroying history, if they see their past/future self, Alice has no past self. Alice visits Time's palace, finding the Chronosphere, an object that powers all time in Underland and travels through the Oceans of Time, Time tells her that the past cannot be altered, she also finds the exiled Red Queen, Iracebeth of Crims (Helena Bonham Carter), in the care of Time. Alice steals the Chronosphere and travels back in time, the Red Queen urges Time to go after Alice, she wants to use the Chronosphere herself to get even with her sister Mirana. Alice accidentally travels to the day of the Red Queen's coronation, where the younger Hatter mocks the Red Queen not fitting the royal crown because of her abnormally large head, this causes her to have a melt down, her father deems her emotionally unqualified to rule and passes the title to her younger sister Mirana. Alice later learns of an event in Iracebeth's and Mirana's past that caused their friction, Alice travels again attempting to change Iracabath's ways and stop the Jabberwocky killing the Hatter's family, she learns the Hatter's father in fact did treasure Tarrant's first hat creation. Alice meets the White Queen and the Red Queen as sisters and witnesses the event, Mirana steals a jam tart from her mother and eats it, when confronted by their mother, Mirana lies that Iracabeth is responsible, Iracabeth runs from the castle upset, Alice trying to change history causes Iracabeth to trip and hit her head on a stone wall, causing her deformity. A weakened Time confronts Alice, he scolds her for putting all of time in danger, running into a nearby mirror Alice reenters the real world, waking in a mental hospital, diagnosed with female hysteria, a doctor tries to inject her, but with the help of her mother Helen (Lindsay Duncan) she escapes, and returns to Underland via the mirror. Alice travels to the day of the Jabberwocky attack, she discovers the Hatter's family were not killed, they were captured by the Red Queen, but she is too late returning to the present, the Hatter is on the brink of death, she tearfully tells the Hatter that she believes him, this transforms him back to his normal self. The Underlandians go to the Red Queen's castle, the Hatter's family have been shrunk and are trapped in an ant farm. The Red Queen captures them and takes the Chronosphere, taking the White Queen with her, back to the day where she lied about eating the tart, by the time Alice and the Hatter get there, the Red Queen and young Iracabeth have seen each other, Time becomes irrelevant and Underland begins to freeze, Alice and the Hatter race back to the present, at the last second Alice is able to place the Chronosphere back in its original place. The Chronosphere stabilises and Underland is restored, the Hatter reunites with his family, the White Queen and the Red Queen make amends, and Alice says goodbye to her friends and returns to the real world, there Alice allows her mother to sign over her father's ship, but Hamish does not get the family home, in the end Alice and her mother from their own shipping company and set out together to travel the world. Also starring Paul Whitehouse as Thackery the March Hare, Andrew Scott as Dr. Addison Bennett, Downton Abbey's Ed Speleers as James Harcourt, Geraldine James as Lady Ascot, Richard Armitage as King Oleron, Hattie Morahan as Queen Elsemere, Siobhan Redmond as Bumalig Hightopp, Wally Wingert as Humpty Dumpty, Meera Syal as Nobody, Frances de la Tour as Aunt Imogene, Toby Jones as Wilkins and Andrew Sachs as Mantel Clock. Depp remains colourful and bonkers, Carter with her big head is still a fiery villain, Cohen in intriguing as the personified Time, and the supporting cast of familiar weird and wonderful creatures are good, the first film was perhaps uneven but good fun, this sequel has a much more determined plot, it doesn't have anything to do with events in the book and it goes off a little in places, but the special effects are brilliant and the story is good, an enjoyable fantasy adventure. Worth watching!",Alice Through the Looking Glass
7,paul_haakonsen,Pretty much as sequels usually go...,5,17 September 2016,"I enjoyed the 2010 ""Alice in Wonderland"" that had that unique Tim Burton touch to it. But I wasn't in any rush to get to see the 2016 sequel ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"". Why? Well, because just what more could there be to tell about this story?With that being said, then don't get me wrong. ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" is not a bad movie, it just seems like a movie that hardly was necessary to have been made. It is a good movie in itself, and works quite well as a stand-alone, if you will.The effects in ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" were great, as they also were in the previous movie. And it was nice to see the beloved characters from the first movie return, and also to see the amazing job that the special effects team pulled off at bringing the world to life. Lots of details, vivid colors and memorable characters.The actors and actresses in the movie were doing good jobs with their given roles, and it was a great treat to have the original cast return to play their characters once again. The Time character was interesting, but it left a less than savory taste in my mouth that they had cast Sacha Baron Cohen for this role. He is not an actor that I am too fond of, so in my opinion another cast would have been preferable. I do enjoy the Mad Hatter character and Johnny Depp does a great job in portraying him. And it was nice to get to see more of that quirky character and get to know more of his background.The special effects and wardrobe teams really are the ones shining in this movie, because there are just so many wonderful things to look at throughout the movie. And the level of creativity is just astounding. No matter where you look there is something breathtaking.""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" is certainly an entertaining movie, but it is hardly one that you will sit down and watch again any time soon.",Alice Through the Looking Glass
8,studioAT,An unwanted sequel,2,4 September 2017,"Having used the books by Lewis Carroll for the first film there's really nowhere for this sequel (an unneeded one at that) to go in terms of plot.It manages to cobble something together, that is equally as nonsensical as anything Carroll dreamed up, but apart from some big names popping up in their roles from last time (Anne Hathaway, Johnny Depp) there is a strong sense throughout that this is a sequel for the sake for a sequel.I'm not saying the Tim Burton directed first part was a masterpiece, but at least it was grounded on something more solid.",Alice Through the Looking Glass
9,LeonLouisRicci,"The Look ""Frozen Supreme Pizza""...Unfulfilled Frenzied Fantasy Fills Frame",5,25 December 2016,"Superficial and Gaudy, the Look Reminds of those Old and Cheap, Paint by Numbers Kits after completion, or a Frozen Supreme Pizza.It's a Busy, Busy, Busy Template of Extremely Detailed Wackiness without being Wonder-Full. There are more Colors than there are Colors. There is more of Everything Imaginable without being Imaginative.Alice's Trips through Time in a Metal Sphere are Back-Dropped with Waves and Waves of Forgettable Imagery that is None too Attractive or Original. In Fact the Film Reminds of other Films all too Often.Some Things are Cool, like the Character of ""Time"" and the Sets that Surround Him, like the Hanging Pocket Watches, but Alice's Friends that Inhabit the ""Tea Party Set"" take a Back-Seat to Time-Travel Sequences. There is a rather Boring, Elongated Scene of Decay that is so Impressed with Itself that it goes on for what seems like an Eternity, only to be Spoiled by a Cheat.Overall, the Costumes and Makeup are Great and the Non-Time Travel Sets are Cleverly Cluttered, if a bit Overwhelming and some of the Acting is Good. But the Movie is Mishandled to a Degree with too many Characters and Things Made of Metal. It has a Strained ""Family"" Story that Never Feels Warm or Organic.Beware the Movie has been known to Literally Cause Headaches, and not only to Film Critics.",Alice Through the Looking Glass
10,grantss,Mildly entertaining,5,14 March 2017,"Alice has just returned from an adventure in which she captained a ship to China and back. She now discovers that Hamish, her former fiancé, has taken advantage of Alice's mother's poor financial situation, forced her to either lose her house or Alice's ship. To escape the situation with Hamish, Alice follows Absolem, a talking bug, through the mirror into another world, a world she is rather familiar with. There she finds old friends like the Mad Hatter, White Queen, Tweedledum and Tweedledee and the Cheshire Cat. The Mad Hatter is in a poor state, pining for his family who died several years ago. To correct this, Alice meets Time, and steals his most valuable possession. This brings her into contact, and conflict, yet again with the irascible, insane Red Queen. Not great, but not terrible either. The set up was slow and felt contrived, especially the real life part. Director James Bobin could have made the movie a whole lot better by diving (literally) into Wonderland almost from the get-go. Even the Wonderland side takes a while to find its point and gain momentum.Once it gets going its a fairly decent ride. No great twists or any real point to it all, but is reasonably good fun.",Alice Through the Looking Glass

But be warned: since its inception, the Disney Megacorp. has been totally oblivious to the Concept of Irony. Therefore, the Bigwigs among the thousands of folks involved with ALICE have no notion that her travails here constitute a perfect analogy for Disney's successful nefarious plot to FREEZE World Copyrights forever. ALICE may come to a happy ending point because the folks in Wonderland are NOT persuaded by crass and blatant bribes to corrupt Common Sense, Nature, and Basic Human Dignity. In Real Life, the Disney Henchpeople have discovered--like all other U.S. billionaires--that the U.S. Congress will decree that Black is White, East is West, and Satan is God for rather modest ""Campaign Contributions.""

12,neil-476,Better than the Burton one,7,30 May 2018,"The two Alice books are must-read classics, and have found their way onto screen in many different versions. James Bobin's film is a direct sequel to Tim Burton's Wonderland film: both take their names from Lewis Carroll's books, but neither takes any more than characters from them: Alice Through The Looking Glass is another original story.The end of Burton's Alice In Wonderland movie saw our heroine ditch her nerdy fiancée and go off to sea. Through the Looking Glass starts with a dramatic sea chase, before Absalom the Butterfly (voiced by Alan Rickman in his final cinema work) calls her back to Underland, where the Mad Hatter (now named as Tarrant Hightopp) is pining away for his lost family. Alice's adventure - seeking the Hightopp family - involves her stealing a time machine from Time himself, a menacing personification of entropy, who is understandably miffed at having this mechanism nicked, especially given that it has the potential to unravel reality.In short, the story has nothing whatsoever to do with Carroll's book. Having said that, it's not a bad story - it holds the attention, has lots of eventfulness and action, illuminates some of the characters, offers a couple of emotional moments, and allows Johnny Depp to mug from under the Hatter's elaborate makeup. I preferred it to the story offered in the previous film.The visuals are, as expected, impressive, and Sacha Baron Cohen's Time is a good addition to the cast. Rhys Ifans as the Hatter's Dad makes less impression. The reservations I had with the first film are still there - Barbara Windsor is just plain Wrong as the voice of the dormouse, naming the characters is both unnecessary and irritating, Anne Hathaway's White Queen's airy-fairy affectations get on your nerves, and Helena Bonfire Carter's Red Queen is still nicked wholesale from Queenie in Blackadder.Mia Wasikowska's Alice is pleasingly feisty, more so than she was in Wonderland. And so we come to Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter. We've seen the character before, of course, and Depp once more gives us the gentle, lisping, well-spoken and slightly barmy Hatter who has a bond with Alice, as well as the occasional psychopath from the Gorbals. To these he adds the declining depressive, a sad reflection of the heartier main iteration. But ultimately they are all Johnny Depp doing funny voices under funny makeups and, despite their appeal, I do find myself wondering if Depp has now overdone the heavily disguised eccentric phase of his career.This is nonetheless an enjoyable film, more so than its predecessor.",Alice Through the Looking Glass

I don't mean that I didn't liked it at all and it's great to see all characters back, with the original cast and effects are again stunning but for me the magic(k) was over.Of course it's Disney and of course it's made for the whole family and you will have your laughter here and there with the rabbit and creatures surrounding the Hatter (Depp) but maybe it was the story that couldn't satisfy me. And it showed at theaters, can't say that it was for a long time in theaters and a lot of them were empty while showing this flick. If you are into Disney then this is a must see of course but it's like seeing bands the second time perform at a gig, the magic is sometimes gone, exactly the same feeling here.

Despite the first Alice movie being mediocre at best, it made a lot of money so here we have a sequel that shouldn't have been made. It ruins even the slightest intrigue the first one had. And gets rid of any magical flare when it comes to the characters. I know when it comes to the message it tries to convey about the importance of time. To choose your own path and make the most of it. But a movie's core message is not enough the carry the movie. Despite the high budget it still comes off as a movie with cheesy CGI and lame scenarios. This sequel tries to delve more into the Wonderland characters and their past but destroys the presence and the charisma they once had. Mad Hatter played by Johnny Depp once again came off super annoying. It just seemed like the whole cast was just there for the paycheck. At least in the first one the characters somewhat had a presence and at least seemed like they were trying. The narrative is just all over the place and came off like a huge mess. Over it being a magical fun time...Kids will be super bored with this one. And the adults will get a headache. 3.5/10",Alice Through the Looking Glass

The plot is fast-paced from start to finish and gives off a very exciting race-against-time story where Alice goes back in time to learn the truth of Mad Hatter's missing family and the misdeeds of the notorious Queen of Hearts. You will be glued to the screen in this wild ride. The CGI effects were beautifully done, cast of characters were delightful and music was nostalgic. There are also some touching elements of family, friendship and courage, and the natural course of time.

18,Hellmant,Still a good (and creepy) kids' flick.,7,1 July 2016,"'ALICE THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Sequel to the 2010 blockbuster fantasy flick 'ALICE IN WONDERLAND', which was (of course) based on Lewis Carroll's classic novels. This film is an even looser adaptation of Carroll's 1871 novel 'Through the Looking-Glass', which was a sequel to 1865's beloved 'Alice's Adventures In Wonderland'. The story, of this movie, revolves around Alice reentering Wonderland, and (once there) going on a time traveling mission, to save the Mad Hatter. It was directed by James Bobin (who previously helmed the last two 'MUPPETS' movies), and it was once again written by Linda Woolverton (who also wrote the 2010 original, as well as 2014's 'MALEFICENT'). Tim Burton, who directed the original movie, returned as just a producer (this time around). Mia Wasikowska, Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Anne Hathaway, Matt Lucas, Stephen Fry, Michael Sheen, Timothy Spall and Alan Rickman (in his final film role) all reprise their parts from the original movie. They're joined, this time around, by Rhys Ifans and Sacha Baron Cohen (who previously worked with Bobin on several episodes of 'DA ALI GI SHOW'). The film was a major bomb at the Box Office (some blame it's financial failure on Depp's recent public image problems), and it's gotten even worse reviews from the critics (than the first movie did). I don't like it as much as the original film, but it's not that bad either.The story begins with Alice Kingsleigh (Wasikowska) returning home, from 3-years of adventure on the high seas. As she returns to London, she learns that a jealous ex, Hamish Ascot (Leo Bill), has taken over her father's company. He's now trying to force Alice into selling her father's ship to him, in exchange for her family home back. Alice is distraught over this, and she returns to Wonderland for escape. Once there, Alice learns that the Mad Hatter (Depp) is in trouble, and she needs to travel back in time to save him. The film has almost nothing to do with Carroll's great literature. That doesn't bother me that much though, but it's definitely not as fun, or involving, as the original movie either. I liked the first film (a lot), for it's creative visuals and spectacular adventure scenes (I was really stoned when I first saw it though). This sequel doesn't have the same thrill, or imagination, but it's still visually fantastic. It's a little slow-paced, at times, but it's also (ultimately) at least somewhat entertaining; it's definitely still a good (and creepy) kids' flick. Wasikowska and Carter both give impressively dominant lead performances, and Cohen is great in his role too. Depp is barely in the film though, it's a shame he still gets top billing (over such powerful women as Wasikowska and Carter), and it's also a little disturbing seeing him on-screen again (after the recent troubling allegations against him). All in all, the film is decent, but nothing spectacular (that's for sure).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/cnnfZjVyQIc",Alice Through the Looking Glass
19,bowmanblue,Surprised they ever made a sequel,6,5 June 2016,"Okay, I'm in the minority, but I quite liked Tim Burton's take on Alice in Wonderland. As he said at the time – the original Disney cartoon version was just a girl wandering from one random encounter with a wacky character to the next, i.e. no story. Yeah, I liked the cartoon exploits as a kid, but I have to agree with that description, so I quite enjoyed watching Alice turn into a knight and slay a dragon-type creature while Johnny Depp looks on.However, I sometimes think I was the only one who felt like that. The 2010 live action Alice in Wonderland was largely slated on all fronts and accused of everything from an overuse in CGI (er, what blockbuster film doesn't these days?!) to a lack of character development (um, again, what film doesn't these days?!). Anyway, because of the reception it received, I was pretty sure that would be the last time Johnny Depp ever plays a wild and wacky, exaggerated character (only joking, but I didn't think he'd hung up his 'mad' hat for good).So, we have the sequel – once again Alice is summoned to Wonderland, this time in order to stop the Mad Hatter from becoming mad (no, seriously). To accomplish this, she needs to travel back in time to stop a cyborg from killing his mother. Wait, that's the plot to Terminator, but it was something like that – insert 'dragon' instead of cyborg and 'family' instead of mother. And, if there's one thing that every single time travel movie has taught us – it's that messing with the timelines never ends well. Or, in this case, makes for a bit of a hit and miss story.Alice jumps from one time period to the next, never really staying in one for long. Johnny Depp (again, fronting much of the promotional material) is left in the 'present' and only really stars for about twenty minutes of screen time, so Alice becomes an observer in one time period after another. This kind of gives the 'story' a jumpy 'sketch-feel' to it. Yes, Sacha Baron Cohen plays 'Time' (literally!) and is a pretty cool villain who we actually feel sorry for, as he's just doing his job, but really the story is just one set piece after the next.There are some 'real' elements set outside Wonderland that act as 'bookends' to the fantasy middle portion, but I'll wager you'll have forgotten the beginning once the Wonderland bits kick off. They're pretty much not needed as it's all about the magical middle.Personally, I preferred the original (granted I may be the only one). I could happily watch it again whereas I don't think that there was enough here to really warrant a second viewing. There was so little plot and what was there was pretty predictable. I doubt they'll bother making a third as 'Alice Through the Looking Glass' is not currently performing too well at the Box Office, opening against the latest X-men movie and trying to bury Johnny Depp's off-screen antics.But, saying that, I took my Mum and daughter to see it and they both really, really liked it. What do I know? Maybe it's simply more appealing to 72 and 11 year olds that 39 year old blokes who would have preferred to see Captain America: Civil War, but was severely overruled?",Alice Through the Looking Glass
20,Cineanalyst,Waste of Time,1,14 August 2020,"Disney's sequel to 2010's ""Alice in Wonderland,"" ""Alice Through the Looking Glass,"" as with its predecessor, has very little in common with Lewis Carroll's classic books. There's an alternate world occupied by some creatures with partially-shared names, including a female (a woman here instead of a child) named Alice falling down a rabbit hole before and, now, going through a mirror. The similarities mostly end there. Not only is this Disney series evidently not really inspired by its literary source, it's antithetical to it. Where there was charm and wit in the books, there is none here. A place where characters were less important than what they represented is turned into a void where what's represented is only characters. Episodic and cleverly-constructed nonsense is replaced with hackneyed journey plotting. Enjoyment unsaddled by sentiment and a moral, here, becomes a cloying morality tale about the importance of family with an obnoxious musical score that's always keeping the audience attuned to what they're supposed to be feeling. This is one of the most vile big-budget, major-studio productions I've seen in some time.Even the CGI animation merely looks expensive rather than imaginative or impressive. The shots of Time chasing after Alice in the ""cronosphere"" (yeah, it's pretty stupid) look especially dreadful--static green-screen stagings that the illusion of movement by animated vortexes can't conceal. The ""cronosphere"" time machine itself looks like a gyroscopic mix between the prop from the 1960 ""The Time Machine"" with the flying capability of the ""Back to the Future"" DeLorean and a toilet. The clockwork stuff doesn't even look as good as what one could find in the first two ""Hellboy"" movies. Even the mirror motif is junk--a vestigial leftover from Carroll's original story.More so than even in the last movie, Alice is turned into a corporate marketing tool to profit from piggybacking on socially-progressive issues. Never mind, I guess, that this Alice is a colonialist--a ship captain for a Victorian-age trading company just back from opening up China for the imperial West. I've never thought much of the claim made by others that Carroll's books have a secret message regarding drugs, but Disney has done quite an inept job of things to tie Alice to the Opium trade.And who in their right mind wants to know the backstories of Wonderland (I mean, ""Underland,"" seeing that Wonderland is a ""real"" place in these movies instead of a dream) creatures. I don't care about the family situation of Johnny Depp's most-irritating character, the Hatter. There's no wonder behind Disney's association of evil with physical deformity, as with the big-headed Queen of Hearts this time. Nobody reads the Alice books and thinks the case of the stolen tarts is in need of more drama. Throughout the picture, I was rooting for Alice to fail and that all of Underland would die. Ironically, the movie is too long, as well.These most recent Alice movies aren't only a disgrace to the legacy of Carroll's books, they're a disgrace to the company's founder, Walt Disney. I'm not the biggest fan of his 1951 cartoon version, either, but it's far better than these two, and, at least, Walt had respect for the source. Walt and company made some interesting short films loosely inspired by the books, too, including Mickey Mouse in ""Thru the Mirror"" (1936) and ""Alice's Wonderland"" (1923), which led to Disney's flagship series of Alice comedies, which combined live action with animation long before his namesake conglomerate made abominations from such technical innovations. The only silver lining here is that the box-office success of the 2010 movie turned out to be a fluke--one likely based largely on the novelty of 3D and Depp's fleeting star power--before he Flutterwacken'ed it away--being associated with the Disney brand. With the same dynamics waning after six years, this one bombed. It was about time.",Alice Through the Looking Glass
21,ericstevenson,Not worth your time,5,7 August 2016,"As someone who just found the original Disney movie to just be alright, I didn't have high hopes for this movie. I guess I probably shouldn't judge as I haven't read the book that this was based on. It doesn't seem like a very faithful adaptation. It's just that the plot in this film seems too minor for a whole movie. It features Alice trying to find the Mad Hatter's family through time travel or rather what their fate is. I admit that the effects and CGI in this film are really quite impressive, but it can't help a mediocre story.What's annoying is how the other characters have so little of a role. They don't do much at all and the story even makes little sense. It's explicitly stated (and proved) that the past can't be altered, even though we clearly see it being changed. I will admit that I like seeing Sacha Baron Cohen as Time. The puns involving him are pretty lame. I am quite confused by the beginning as I seriously thought it was just something in Alice's imagination, but instead it's real. The dialogue was pretty predictable and it was weird how it ended with Alice telling her mother to sign the papers and then she didn't sign them. It just seems pointless. It's far from awful, as it does feature clever ideas and it's great to look at. I guess I'm just used to seeing better movies in theaters. **",Alice Through the Looking Glass

To assuage the addled Hatter, Alice swipes a gadget from Father Time (Sacha Baron Cohen) and travels to the past to save them.Lacking a reason to exist beyond financial gains, this laughably loose adaptation of Lewis Carroll's literary sequel forges its own sloppy narrative about time-travel.

23,Bored_Dragon,Slightly better than the first one,7,3 September 2018,"If you glue this movie directly to the end of the previous one from 2010, you probably wouldn't even notice that it's two films. So, everything I wrote about ""Alice in Wonderland"" stands for this one too. However, this one is perhaps slightly more entertaining.6,5/10From the perspective of the ten-year-old kid, I could maybe raise it to 8/10.Alice in Wonderland (2010)Disappointment
29 August 2018""Alice in Wonderland"" by Lewis Carroll, directed by Tim Burton (whom I love), starring celebrities like Johnny Depp (whom I adore), Helena Bonham Carter, Anne Hathaway, Crispin Glover, Stephen Fry, Alan Rickman and legendary Christopher Lee, with technical capabilities of year 2010 and a $ 200 million budget ... You can not blame me for having high expectations. And when you see this wonder of wasted potential you won't blame me for being disappointed either.The film is visually impressive and I really have no complaints, but everything else is lousy. Tim Burton didn't really fail, but we all know that he can do it much much better. Mad Hatter is one of Depp's weakest roles, Mia Wasikowska is sweet and she played Alice quite decent, and only Helena Bonham Carter really made an impression on me. The story is cute but lousy, it's not boring, but it doesn't engage you as much as such adventure should. You will not have the urge to turn off the movie, but you will not be upset if you need to leave it in half. However, I'm not sure how much is that the fault of unimaginative screenwriter and director (it certainly isn't Carroll's fault), and how much is this actually result of this being Disney movie primarily intended for children, which imposes many limitations. But the fact that the film is intended for children is just an explanation, and not an excuse for a naive, shallow and too simple story. A quality movie for children should be multilayered, on the first glance simple enough to entertain children, but with a certain depth that will intrigue adults. This movie doesn't have that. If you are out of elementary school you're too old for this.6/10",Alice Through the Looking Glass
24,tabuno,A Visual Feast that Carries On The Wonderful Alice,8,13 January 2019,"30 May 2016. The visual delight of sharp colors bombards the eyes with amazing, creative, feast for hungry film goers. This palette of rainbows and geometric magical forest of sites brings Alice-like wonder to the optic nerves. This sequel bursts with vibrant life developing its primary characters further in a strong female led role. This fantasy come to life offers a script filled with a meandering thread of life and death, of space and time, and weaves it magic in tender and sometimes action-filled circles. Predictable for the most part with a not completely developed tie up between sisters, this film is entertaining to the visual senses and a matured bed-time story for the imagination. The close-ups of Johnny Depp's character are sometimes the highlight of the movie.",Alice Through the Looking Glass
25,The-Sarkologist,"They had to make a sequel, didn't they?",6,28 May 2016,"Since I really enjoyed the first movie it goes without saying that I was going to see this film, but then again I suspect that that is how sequels work – capitalise on the popularity of a previous movie. The other thing is that Carrol did actually write a sequel to Alice in Wonderland, with the exact same title, however the only similarities between the book and the movie is that Alice goes through a mirror into another world, and in the Carrol original it isn't even the same world as the one from Alice in Wonderland (though since the original book is actually a nonsense poem, it doesn't really matter whether there is any consistency or not).As for this film we encounter Alice as the captain of a ship running away from pirates in the straights of Malacca. Upon returning to England she has discovered that her patron has died and the man whom she publicly rejected has now taken over the company, and wants to put her into the back office. Mind you, the people of Underland want her to come back, namely because the Mad Hatter has fallen into a fit of depression and is on the verge of death. It turns out that his family was killed in the past, however he discovered something, the first hat that he ever made, that suggests that this might be the case. As such Alice has to go back in time, after stealing a time travelling device from Father-Time, to try and work out what is going on.Needless to say that I did enjoy the film, though as I have hinted it is nowhere near as good as the previous film. Of course the main characters of the original film have been brought back, however we also have some new characters, in particular Father Time (who isn't actually an old man, and also a bit of a bumbler as well). Since it is not possible to change the past in this universe, there are a few events that happen in this film that lead on to events in the first film, though not that much.

That's true of most sequels, but it's especially true of Alice Through The Looking Glass. This movie was made for one reason. Alice In Wonderland made money. A lot of it. Over $300 million at the domestic box office alone! Original director Tim Burton is not involved with this one, and it shows, truthfully the movie as a whole is a mess. It rook me three attempts to get through it. All the major characters from the first film return, but Carter is criminally sidelined. The girl playing Alice is in every scene, yet, she makes zero impression!! Depp makes even less impact. Truthfully even writing this is boring me. Despite Depp going on a huge publicity tour, and appearing at Disneyland as The Mad Hatter to surprise guests. Alice Through The looking Glass only grossed $77 million at the domestic box office to end the year to 39th highest grossing movie of 2016.",Alice Through the Looking Glass
27,Reno-Rangan,Alice returns to the wonderland for a new adventure.,6,24 October 2016,"Based on the nearly 150 years old children's book, and a sequel to the 2010 film. Its quite a long gap for a follow up film, but the original cast has returned and directed by 'The Muppets' famed filmmaker. So, I was not expecting it since I considered the first film an average. All I wanted was a normal live-action 'Alice in Wonderland' films, but I disliked this weird make-ups and large head characters. In that perspective, this one was much better. Still, this is not the best, but definitely a lot better than the previous one.A simple adventure story with nice graphics and performances. The Alice returns to the Wonderland for a new adventure where she has to cross the layers of the present, past and future. So in one word, this is a time travel theme in the fantasy genre. Mia Wasikowska ruled it, she was everywhere. She overran all other characters and takes the toughest challenge to achieve impossible.Nearly a two hour journey into wonderland might make happy for little kids. Because it did not look like a normal fairytale, but very modern. This is not the Disney's best film, so I don't think there will be any more sequel. I want it to be rebooted, but not any time soon, at least a decade of gap needed. So I hope they won't rush and ruin this classic tale like three 'Spiderman' reboots in less than 20 years. Meantime, this film is okay for watching once, though I'm not in favour to recommend it to anybody except little children.6/10",Alice Through the Looking Glass

The visual imagination is good as always though.",Alice Through the Looking Glass
29,filipemanuelneto,"A visual show based on a feeble script, where the cast tried without success and the director did not demand much.",6,9 February 2021,"There are some films that are made only for the money that is expected to be collected from them. After seeing this film, I think it fits that description. ""Alice in Wonderland"" was a box office and critical hit, and had a good financial fit. The sequel, expected, takes advantage of the title of a novel that Lewis Carroll wrote after ""Alice in Wonderland"". Just the title! The story has nothing to do with the book that, out of curiosity, turned 145 years in the year the film was released.The script begins with Alice's return from a trip to the Chinese seas and the discovery that her mother had gone into debt and passed control of the family firm to Hamish who, by malice, decided to take revenge by forcing her to sell her ship. It's in this context that Alice returns to the magical country that she already knows after going through a mirror. There, she discovers that she was ""summoned"" to the country to help the Mad Hatter, who is dying of sadness for believing that his entire family, presumably dead, may be alive somewhere. Alice will have to go to the Castle of Time and get the Chronosphere, a time-travel machine that would allow her to discover what happened to the Hatter's family.I was unimpressed with this film. I think the direction of James Bobin bet a lot on the visual and little on the script. In fact, I found surprising that Burton did not stay with the direction and preferred to stay in production. I think it would have been better for the film to have Burton in the chair. Linda Woolverton's script seemed to be predictable and not very creative, with childish's dialogues, forced jokes and too many puns that fade over time. The material given to the actors was probably not the best either.Mia Waskikowska is quite good as Alice, she looks safe and confident. Helena Bonham Carter gave soul and emotion to a character who was, therefore, very humanized. Sacha Baron Cohen is also in good shape and this is reflected in the inspired and fun way he brought Time to life. I bet he had fun with the character and did this job with pleasure, I got to feel it when I saw him. However, if we put aside these three actors who, in fact, did very well, the cast's performance is generally poor. Johnny Depp, for example, was a shadow of himself, and he is one of those actors that I consider almost a safe bet for fantastic characters. I believe that the bad phase he was going through at the time of filming had a strong influence (the stormy divorce with Amber Heard), but the bad material of the script did not help him either. Anne Hathaway was also bad in a lifeless, emotionless performance, as if she was not engaged in her work. The film also features Rhys Ifans, Geraldine James, Lindsay Duncan and Leo Bill, but they all seem to be adrift, doing as they see fit and without much support from the director. The voice actors, as their characters, were in the third place of importance, highlighting only the very brief contribution of Allan Rickman because it was his last work.Technically, the film is great, as its predecessor had previously been. These are films with a great visual focus, and where a lot of money is invested in CGI and state-of-the-art effects. The result is what is calculated: a visual show with a colorful, vibrant and intense cinematography. The effects of the storm at sea and the maritime maneuvers of Alice's ship were very well done and the fantastic world of Wonderland looks incredible, although not as absurd as Carroll's imagination would have liked, I think. This is compensated by the Castle of Time, as extravagant as possible. The costumes also help, starting with Time's and the two queens (I didn't like Alice's oriental costume so much, I confess). Still a word for the good conception of the Seconds and, particularly, of the guard of the Red Queen, inspired by the magnificent art of Arcimboldo, who is one of my favorite artists of the Renaissance period. Whoever has never seen one of his artworks must see it. As for Danny Elfman's soundtrack, I think it meets expectations, but it doesn't stand out.",Alice Through the Looking Glass
30,pennyelenabooks,Good enough,6,29 March 2017,"One thing about this movie: it wasn't that bad. The reviews mostly supported that this film is bad. However, as least for me, it was quite enjoyable. Some of the special effects were really good, almost magical, representing wonderland beautifully. However, some were almost like a badly made computer game. But my main problem with this movie was the story. The reason why Alice had to go into the time world and steal time was weak, like they had to think of an excuse to make an adventure and that was the first thing that came into mind. The make up was weird (even for wonderland), but the performances were good. Still, however, it wasn't as good as the first movie and surely it won't be a movie that I'll watch again.

31,leonblackwood,Looked great but the storyline was average! 5/10,5,9 October 2016,"Review: This movie certainly looked spectacular, and you could see were every bit of the budget went but the storyline seemed a bit messy and the whole ""back and forth in time"" concept got a little confusing after a while. Mia Wasikowska, who plays Alice Kingsleigh, didn't have much screen charisma and none of the crazy situations seemed to surprise her. The best thing in the first movie was Helena Bonham Carter's character, Iracebeth but she wasn't in this movie that much. Johnny Depp was perfect as the Hatter, and his various emotions throughout the movie, really did show that no one else could have played that role. Anne Hathaway (Mirana), seemed to be over acting most of the time and Sacha Baron Cohen (Time) could have put some more effort into his role but the movie was entertaining and I liked the fact that the director showed Alice moving on in life, as a business lady. When she hears that Hatter is depressed, Alice goes back to Wonderland to help her close friend. Hatter tells Alice that he feels that his parents are still alive, so she goes back in time to try and save them. That's basically the quick version of the movie but there are other elements which make the movie watchable. I did prefer the first movie, mainly because of the various characters and the crazy Iracebeth but this movie didn't bring anything new to the franchise, accept for the new character, Time, who could have been much better. Watchable!Round-Up: UK born James Bobin, 44, chose to director this sequel, taking over the project form Tim Burton, who was constantly on the set to make sure that he didn't make a mock of all his hard work in the first movie. Most of the characters looked the same, which must have been hard work because the original was made in 2010, and Mia Wasikowska didn't look like she had aged at all. James Bobins previous work include, the various Ali G series, hence why he was in the movie, the Muppets and the Muppets Most Wanted. As this movie was based on a book, which I haven't read, the outcome might be because the director was trying to stay true to the original story, so I can't completely blame the director. What I do find amazing is that the original story was written in 1871, and audiences are still flocking to the cinema to watch Alice's amazing journey. Budget: $170million Worldwide Gross: $300millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their adventure/family/fantasy movies, starring Mia Wasikowska, Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Anne Hathaway, Sacha Baron Cohen, Matt Lucas and Alan Rickman. 5/10",Alice Through the Looking Glass
32,Tweetienator,Solid,6,30 May 2016,"Well, if u liked the first movie there is a good chance u will like this one also. For all readers who like the books by Carroll u should be warned - the story of this Disney product has nothing to do with the original Alice Through the Looking Glass. So like the first movie this one is filled with CGI-landscapes and weird characters and some tasks and adventures to be completed by Alice (solid play again by Mia Wasikowska). This time Alice has to do some timetravel to save Wonderland and restore the order of the universe and we get some insight about the cause for the love/hate relationship of the Red and the White Queen. I myself enjoyed watching the movie like the first one but in no way I would say that these two movies are masterpieces or made big lasting impression on me. The last version of The Wizard of Oz - Oz the Great and Powerful with James Franco, Mila Kunis and Rachel Weisz was a far better made adaption of Oz world. But anyway, what u get is a little adventure-movie with some actors who apparently have fun acting like weirdos on acid. Cohen as Time is fun to watch, Bonham-Carter a professional crazy like always, Depp is - like Depp is, u like his play or not, but ofc after all the movies he has done the magic of his play is a little more than just worn off. Imo the biggest issue of the movie is its length - 30 or 40 min less would have been more because sometimes the movie just moves too slow and some scenes are not really necessary for the story.The one version of Alice in Wonderland I do really miss and I would like to see on screen would be the interpretation of American McGee's Alice/Alice Madness Returns - the dark, bloody, nightmarish version (video/pc games) that I liked so much to play. All ppl who played or know this games will understand me. For that at least R-rated-movie I would hire Zack Snyder or Tim Burton as directors or Sam Raimi. Ah, that would be a dark feast!

Title got nothing to with movie's story actually, cause story is about Time. That Glass thing is very small. Performances of all Actors are good enough to praise them all. Less screen space to Johnny Depp was disappointing. Writing is Very Good, because Climax is like fulfill end to a fairy tale. Its all Visual world in 3D so technical field has to be great and it is great. Visual and 3D effects are excellent. Runtime is 114 minutes which is neither long too long nor too short. Screenplay is good Enough to keep you hooked. Cinematography is Brilliant. Direction is fairly good Considering movie as a whole, despite having some ignorable minuses.

Alice resolves to borrow the Chronosphere from Time (Sacha Baron Cohen) and use it to investigate what happened to them. Time refuses to give her the device, which Alice then steals and begins a quest back through the history of her friends, with Time in pursuit.A change of director for the sequel, but it's essentially in name only as Tim Burton has established the tone and look of the films that James Bobin, of ""The Muppets Movie"" fame, continues with. That tone and look is of course ""whimsy"". WHIMSY BY THE BUCKETLOAD. All the forced whimsy that you can possibly manage. And it's all the more boring for it. With the possible exception of Alice, I don't like these characters, even the ones I'm supposed to root for, like the White Queen and the Hatter. They seem like terrible, infuriating people to actually spend time with. It feels like a movie that everyone involved made because they were contractually obliged too, and not because they actually wanted too.The only bit of the film I do like is the character of Time. I like that he's not a traditional villain, given that he really needs the chronosphere to keep time going and is actually trying to save the world but also I liked that Cohen played him as if he was channelling Werner Herzog, which I found constantly amusing.With a gun to my head, I might suggest that I liked this more than the original - but genuinely like it, I did not.",Alice Through the Looking Glass

By doing this Alice must go to the time realm owned by Time(an unrecognisable Sacha Baron Cohen) and use a time sphere to go back.

38,subxerogravity,Very weak,6,5 June 2016,"In there attempt to create a movie as mad as the Hatter himself, they made one that was far too all over the place.I'm surprise the film did not revolve around Johnny Depp more. Since the sequel to Tim Burton's, Alice in Wonderland is an original story, you would think you'd give Johnny more time to shine, but instead they stay true to the original content.Mia Wasikowska plays an adult version of Alice whose adventures in Wonderland influences her to become a sea captain looking to explore the world, but when her friend the Mad Hatter is in trouble, she is willing to break time itself to save him.Sasha Baron Cohen plays the only new character in The mix as Father Time. Though I think ironically the Borat star actually has a Knack for kids moves (if you seen Hugo, you might agree) but really the material is not that strong. It starts off good with the whole fairy tale motif of Rhythm and Riming you'd fine in a good fairy tale story, but gets weak fairly fast with a noticeable clinging to special effects to drive the story.It's pretty boring all together with very few interesting moments to keep you glued to it.",Alice Through the Looking Glass

Seriously, they both are good actors, one better than the other (I'm not a Johnny Depp fan, however, I really like Cohen very much). Anne Hathaway is an excellent actress but here is almost nonexistent and transparent. Helena Bonham Carter is OK. Mia Wasikowska as Alice, doesn't fits at all.

The moment I realised that the opening 'pirate adventure' was not just a dream sequence but rather the 'reality' side of some new post-feminist iteration of Alice's life, I knew that I was going to hate this movie - and it did not let me down. All I can hope for is that the dismal returns on Disney's investment guarantees that the studio won't desecrate another classic. Wishful thinking I'm sure - they didn't learn anything from John Carter. There is a reason why people still avidly read these books a century after they were written - they are that good - they don't need to be rewritten, updated, have their characters co-opted or their name and tradition exploited.",Alice Through the Looking Glass

Everybody jumps back in there roles so perfectly it's like they never left.Mia Wasikowska slips back into her role as Alice quite perfectly, I thought Johnny Depp was gonna be lame here, but he really is quite the scene steal er has The Mad Hatter, with his interesting use of dialog. Helena Bonham Carter is also pretty good has the evil queen, in this film we dive more into her background on why she is the way she is. Anne Hathaway I felt was not giving much to do here as the white queen. Sacha Baron Cohan is also a scene steal er has TIME, he was basically doing a Peter Sellers like accent. He did this so his kids could watch this. I like the message it sends across, about dealing with the past, and that time travel doesn't always settle it.

This one is directed by James Bobin-Muppets Most Wanted, The Muppets, Da Ali G Show_tv-and Tim is only a producer. Maybe, just maybe, that is why this one is not as good. The looks of the film are great but the story.....not so good. Mia returns as Alice, who travels back to Wonderland for another adventure. It seems that Johnny/Mad Hatter is in a serious depression, missing his presumed dead family. Mia is on a mission to find out exactly what happened to Johnny's family and ends up meeting Sacha/Time, a man in charge of time itself-I guess that is why he is just called Time. Mia steals a time travel device and when she uses it, Time-and all of regular time too-is thrown out of whack. She-and, of course, the audience-do get to learn the origins of Johnny and the White & Red sister Queens, Anne and Helena. You also get to learn how Helena got such a huge head. Alan Rickman voices the caterpillar, now a butterfly, in this, his last film appearance-I think the movie was released about 4 months after his death. As the end credits start, there is a dedication to him. It's rated ""PG"" for action, peril and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 53 minutes.

43,iquine,Unengaging Story,5,17 July 2017,"(Flash Review)This felt like a cash grab for all involved. Perhaps not having Tim Burton at the helm didn't bode well for the bland script. The basic plot is the Mad Hatter is feeling downtrodden so Alice has to go back in time to help him. While going back in time she must outwit a personification of time. Time was probably the best character in the movie. Lots of CGI time traveling effects. By the way, all 5 points go to the production team as they did a great job. If only there was half the effort put into the story and script. There were a smattering of witty jokes but overall I felt zero engagement or concern for the character's efforts. There was also a sub plot point that bookends the entire movie but by the end you had completely forgotten about it so you are likeoh yah, they had to tie that up rather than add meaning by touching on it throughout.",Alice Through the Looking Glass

The film is CGI heavy, but does look great for the vast majority. The cast are good, with Mia Wasikowska leading well and surrounded by the likes of Johnny Depp, Anne Hathaway, Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen.I do think the film could've been slightly shorter, with better pacing and less emphasis on the 'real world' stuff featuring Alice.

47,aharmas,We don't have all the time in the world,3,31 May 2016,"I hate to waste time. I think wasting talent is unforgivable, and seeing beauty without heart or feeling is pretty sad. In what must be one of the biggest disappointments of the year, there is just not much to admire not because of the fact that is not there, but because it has been muddled and distorted beyond salvation. One can probably look at still, it listen to bits if the soundtrack to see the individual jewels. As a whole, this film is just something to endure.Back are some of the original talents. Elfman is barely there, maybe not inspired by what he sees. Cohen struggles to make an impression and fails. He's buried under his costume and overwrought sets. They're the basic problem here. We find everything you can dream of but moderation or sensible editing. Did they have one or did they run out of time?In the middle of this chaos there's a seed of a story, a good one. However, I don't go to the movies to endure an experience. Alice must travel through time to save the Mad Hatter's family. time travel is always a terrific premise, but the effects, the overcrowding of sounds and visuals ruin the experience. This is perfectly obvious when the movie slows down. Then it has life, and when it goes back to the insane and chaotic, loud, and blinding pace, it sputters badly.There's also the wooden acting and aimless direction. Helena overdoes it again, Depp and Hathaway appear to be in a daze. Mia barely registers since the actors as well as the audience seem to be fighting the overload of visual and audio effects. This is a film that is painful to watch in IMAX because it intensifies the experience, which is not a great one.Overall, it's a film that might have a chance if someone goes back and does some serious editing, but it's going to take a lot of time.",Alice Through the Looking Glass
48,peterp-450-298716,"A colorful and imaginative movie. But gosh, it's complex and confusing as well.",5,28 October 2016,"""I do not know who you are. You're not my Alice. My Alice believes in me.""I've never been a fan of the ""Alice in Wonderland"" fairy tale. It's a rather bizarre story that took shape in the inventive mind of Lewis Carroll. Not that it lacked imagination, but I had the impression that the wizardry with literary tricks got the most attention. A story richly filled with roguish puns. When I started watching this movie, there was one thing in my disadvantage. My total ignorance about the character Alice. I didn't even bother to watch the previous movie ""Alice in Wonderland"" from 2010. So that makes that a character like Hatter (Johnny Depp) a complete stranger to me.The opening scene of the film actually is a reflection of the rest. A highly professional imaged pursuit at sea, with Alice Kingsleigh (Mia Wasikowska) skillfully maneuvering her boat over a reef while using a seemingly improbable sail trick. Why those Malaysian pirates were chasing her, was completely unclear to me and nowhere explained afterwards. And that's also the overall image I have about this movie. Superbly imaged, but so unclear and very confusing. Of course my lack of knowledge about Alice is a leading factor. But the way Underland (where Alice returns by stepping through a magical mirror) is designed, is truly phenomenal. The beautiful colors splash right off the screen. A surreal world full of wondrous things and enchanting characters. It reminded me a bit of ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" where you also could admire a multicolored wonderland.And not only the imaginative scenery are stunning. Also the wonderful characters look unreal and mega-fantastic at the same time. Alice sees her old friends again after a long time. And it's a colorful group of fantasy figures. Absolem, Thackery and Cheshire Cat are wonderful, brisk animations. Tweedle dee and dumb (Matt Lucas) look witty, yet scary in a way. Mirana, the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) is rather ...well ... colorless. Iracebeth, the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) is not only an annoying character, but also an interesting and at time sometimes madcap character. And in between whirls Alice. She isn't surprised about this miraculous world, since it is not the first time she ends up there. And obviously you'll meet Hatter Tarrant Hightopp, a crazy and carnivalesque hatter, whose health rapidly deteriorates. The only remedy is to find back his family. But seemingly, this isn't so obvious. Apparently they've died in the past. The only way to succeed, is to travel back in time. And that 's exactly what Alice is going to ask Time (Sacha Baron Cohen). How can she go back in time and prevent Hatter's family of being killed? And that's when the majestic part of Cohen (aka Borat) begins. He's the personification of time. And he plays it in a sublime and magnificent way.Visually, the film is just phenomenally beautiful. Content wise it's terribly chaotic. At certain moments I really couldn't keep up with the story. It really felt as if they tried to cram lots of facts, characters and story lines in one film. And those time travels weren't making it simple either. Even the eccentric Depp couldn't convince me. The whole story revolves around him in a way. As a result he's in the picture lots of times. To be honest, his character started to irritate me a bit after a while. I'd rather would have seen those other characters in action a bit more often. Like Time for instance. Unprecedented the best part in this Alice in Wonderland chapter. A pedant, despotic figure who isn't afraid to put you in an endless time loop. Assisted by his submissive employees (called minions) he controls time in this wonderland. And he carries out this painstaking work, while residing in his impressive ""Palace of Time"". A visually striking building and imaginative creation. But eventually I came to the same conclusion. Alice in Wonderland is not ""my cup of tea.""More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",Alice Through the Looking Glass

50,TheOneThatYouWanted,~ ~ Makes the first one look like Citizen Kane ~ ~,1,26 May 2016,"Spoiler-Free Review. Easily the worse movie I've seen this year. The 2010 version of Alice in Wonderland wasn't a great movie but at least is was entertaining and even watchable at times. This on the other hand is complete garbage. The plot plays like a last minute fan-fiction story you'll find on Reddit. The acting is unimpressive and screams of ""I'm just making this film because of the paycheck."" I went into this movie knowing it wasn't going to be as good as the 2010 film but after almost 15 minutes into the film, I started yawning. At least five people started scrolling on their smartphones about halfway into the film and no one cared, in fact we all understood why. I was tempted to pull out my phone and play around but I hate people who do that during a movie and I didn't want to be one of them. Without giving anything away, the biggest problem with the movie isn't the fact that it is boring. Oh God, it is boring af. But no, that isn't the biggest problem. The biggest problem is that it is just stupid. It is like they made this movie for kids who like watching The Minions movies just because the minions act and do dumb things. This movie must have been a last minute rush job. Anyway. On the bright side, this movie is very forgettable.",Alice Through the Looking Glass

52,jadepietro,Visually Stunning but Emotionally Empty,7,28 May 2016,"(RATING: ☆☆☆½ out of 5) THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: Too many liberties are taken in this sequel which is visually stylish but emotionally inert. GRADE: B-SYNOPSIS: Alice returns to Wonderland which is curiouser and curiouser to say the least. Alice Through the Looking Glass adds more than a mere word in its title and takes very little inspiration from Lewis Carroll's successful sequel of Alice in Wonderland. It fabricates new characters and a screwy plot to the classic tale with decidedly mixed results. This sequel of a sequel may still have many creative flourishes in its luscious production design, as did Tim Burton's 2010 cinematic take on that novel, but this movie quickly fades from memory, just like a Cheshire Cat's smile, despite its state-of-the arts wizardry.￼Here, or there, Alice (a pale Mia Wasikowski, both in appearance and performance) returns to Wonderland. Years have passed since our last outing with this girl and our little Alice is all grown up. Now, an independent seafaring woman-empowered captain of her own ship, she eagerly sets sail for adventure and will later meet some old friends including the eccentric Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp, again at his hammy best), The White Rabbit (voiced by Michael Sheen) and Dormouse (Barbara Windsor), The White Queen (Anne Hathaway, paler yet), The Cheshire Cat (voiced by Stephen Fry), The Blue Caterpillar (voiced by the late Alan Rickman), and The Red Queen (Helen Bonham Carter, scene-stealer once more).￼On her journey through the other side of the mirror, now known as Underland, Alice is asked to save the Mad Hatter who is quickly losing what is left of his sanity and is in dire straits. Our feminist heroine, who is constantly upstaged by the strange denizens she encounters, does indeed meet many new characters. Some are from the Carroll novel like Tweedledum, Tweedledee, and Humpty Dumpty; others are brought into this convoluted story-line such as The King of Underland (Richard Armitage), Bayard the Bloodhound (voiced by Timothy Spall) and Time (a buffoonish miscast Sacha Baron Cohen, outfitted in steam-punk attire and sporting a German accent which comes and goes like time itself.) The new assortment of uninspired crazies do little to enthrall.￼Purists, beware! In this theatrical re-telling, there are no tales told of the Jabberwock (a mere mention), no Lion or Unicorn, nor any Walrus and Carpenter. The chess match theme is gone as well. Alas, this version literally has no poetry or insight. Humpty does have a big fall that is nano-seconds in length. However, the biggest tumble comes from the dumb screenplay by Linda Woolverton which lacks clarity, whimsy, and charm. Nothing could get this mess back together again. She tries to give some characters a needless back story to explain the characters' motivations and actions and fails miserably. Her script becomes curious-er and curious-er, especially when just adhering to Carroll's original story-line would have been a wiser and wiser notion.In this heavy-handed fantasy, our grown-up Alice's mission is solely to help The Hatter by capturing a sci-fi inspired object called the Chronosphere, which is coveted by Time and The Red Queen. The film is just a series of misadventures (including the script) that are strung together with the thinnest of narrative threads. The whole enterprise would seem as if it were much ado about nothing, were it not redeemed by its state-of-the arts dazzling CGI visuals. The look of the film is pure Burton, without its imaginative director. (Mr. Burton did serve as one of the film's producers and his mark is all over this venture.) Helming the direction this time is James Bobin who imitates the master's surreal images quite well. He keeps the action flowing and steeps his film with vivid colors and fancy visuals. The film is never boring, but it is never endearing either.￼However, it is the artisans behind the scenes that accomplish the film's true sense of wonder. Kudos to the ever-present costume genius Colleen Atwood, a clever score from the prolific Danny Elfman, Stuart Dryburgh's richly hued cinematography, the eye-popping production design by Dan Hennah, plus the hundreds of artists creating the wonderful make-up designs and stunning visual effects.￼With Alice Through the Looking Glass, there isn't much here to feed the mind, just the head with its bountiful visual feast. I, for one, can bask and admire the eye-popping splendor for quite a long while until my palette is in need of tastier morsels of wit and substance. However, if style and flash is your cup of tea, drink it all in! There's enough here to pass for entertainment.",Alice Through the Looking Glass
53,rgkarim,"Beautiful Visuals, Wonderful Acting, But Mediocre overall",7,29 May 2016,"Hey, Hey, Hey it is Robbie K and I'm unleashing a second review for this holiday weekend. Today's movie is one that promises wonder, excitement, madness, and of course Disney magic. Yes, today's review is on Alice through the Looking Glass, an unexpected sequel given that both of Lewis Carroll's stories had already had films dedicated to them. Nevertheless James Bobin and Disney studios are giving it another go to bring Wonderland (or is it Underland?) to life. So why don't we get started withTHE GOOD: Beautiful world and creature design  Plenty of Comedy  A decent beginning  Good acting One thing I always love to see in these movies, is the design teams' ability to bring Wonderland to life. Through the Looking Glass once more grabs hold of us and drags us into the trippy imagination of Carroll in glorious detail. Brilliant colors, twisted towers, and distorted scenery are all present in spectacular effects that immerse you into the world. And filling the landscape are bizarre creatures who add their own touch of magic to scenes, each befitting of the environment they are in. The new minions of Time and The Red Queen will entertain young ones and are a welcome addition to the CGI world. Unfortunately, they (alongside the classic characters) are somewhat underutilized in this movie (more on that later). While the world is thrilling and impressively designed, it is not the only thing entertaining in this film. Through the Looking Glass has plenty of laughs within the two hour run time that will have both young and old laughing alike. For this reviewer, the writing had some well-developed puns and jabs that had the theater chuckling. The Time puns are somewhat clever, but do get a tad stale at times when they abuse the simplistic comedy. Alice, the Red Queen, and The Mad Hatter also get some unique one-liners in as well, the timing more comedic than the actual lines themselves. But it's actually the acting that truly brings the punch. Cohen as Time was a perfect casting call, as he was able to deliver great accents, annoyed looks, and some original material were the funniest aspects for me. In terms of story, how did this original tale fare in my books. The opening was well developed, a fantastic introduction that reintroduced to the lives of our characters while setting up the dilemma at hand. Once Alice steps back into Wonderland, the mystery begins and the suspense builds as you try to uncover all the secrets at hand. It's the second half of the movie where the problems hit. Speaking of which, let's hit on.THE BAD: The second half of the film  Under utilized characters  Missing some of the magic The second half of the film was not nearly as developed as the opening and felt a bit rushed in my opinion. After a great set-up, the solutions began to come too fast, and there seemed to be little challenges standing in the way of Alice and company. Even the Red Queen's threats felt a bit shallow at points and she was nowhere near as menacing as the first (I missed her powerful beasts). In addition, the time travel tale began to unravel and they found a convenient loop to bring the final dilemma at hand. A nice try for originality, but the execution needs some fine tuning to deliver the satisfying finish.In addition the characters were not nearly as integrated as the last film. Old classics like the Cheshire Cat, White Rabbit, and the Door Mouse had key parts in the last film. But in this sequel many of them dropped into the background where they managed to make a few fun comments or look cute before disappearing again. The White and Red Queen got a little more time thanks to their story, but as mentioned earlier their characters seemed a bit diluted compared to what we saw eight years ago. But don't fret because Time, Alice, and the Hatter are the key players in this story and as such will be the ones you see the most of, which isn't a bad thing just disappointing that our characters couldn't all be in the show longer. Which brings me to the final weakness, missing the magic. We have a lot of great things in this movie, but something about it feels off from Alice's other adventures. Maybe it was the rushed ending of the story, or maybe the lack of key character integration, but Through The Looking Glass is missing the oddness its predecessors have. And with the lack of threats from rampaging beasts and a tyrannical queen, the dilemma was much less suspenseful than I wanted. I also feel this story took a turn down the PG lane, which may not have been the best move creative wise. THE VERDICT:Through The Looking Glass certainly has a spectacular look and has some of the adventure we loved in the first installment. In addition the actors play their parts well, and the writing is great in terms of adding a comedic zest to the cuisine. Yet it still is missing some of the magic and wonder that Tim Burton brought us and makes this film duller than I had expected. I think that the visuals took a little more precedence than the second half of the story, as well as not integrating all the characters into the tale. Thanks to thisI have to recommend this one for a Redbox rent at home instead of a theater visit. Should you choose to hit the movies for this one, I encourage a 2-D showing to save some money. My scores are: Adventure/Family/Fantasy: 7.0 Movie Overall: 6.0",Alice Through the Looking Glass

55,bkrauser-81-311064,Hard to Really Love or Hate,4,31 May 2016,"In many ways Alice Through the Looking Glass is an easy movie to hate. The film is a sequel to the completely unnecessary Alice in Wonderland (2010) live-action reboot which became a hit largely due to their still being goodwill towards Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. This time around, the proceedings of the film take place without Tim Burton and largely sans Johnny Depp who's Mad Hatter monopolizes the plot but remains on the bench for most of the film. What we're left with is Mia Wasikowska's Alice whose blase lack of wonderment in the last film, sunk the movie like a skiff on shallow shoals.The film starts years after the events of the first; Alice (Wasikowska), now the Captain of a merchant ship, returns home to London where her father has passed away. Her mother (Duncan) has traded in the rights of her ship for backing on the family home all but guaranteeing Alice's wondering days are behind her. Meanwhile in Wonderland, The Mad Hatter (Depp) is unwell. He insists his family is alive despite tragedy striking some years earlier. No one, including Alice believes him; thus he withers away (for some reason). The White Queen (Hathaway) suggests the only way to bring the Hatter's family back is to talk to Time (Baron Cohen) who is in possession of ""The Chronosphere,"" a time machine of sorts. Thus Alice goes on another adventure in Wonderland, which quite frankly would be better served without her visits.If recreating the same ornate CGI cacophony of the last movie was this film's goal then it passes with flying colors. There's certainly a lot to take in. The whimsical costumes and the merry, candy-colored set-dressing are certainly pretty. Unlike the original's over reliance on green-screen bravado, this one seems to have a fondness for the middle-England meets Willow (1988) aesthetic. The film is also serviced by Sasha Baron Cohen's dark, angular and severe costume which decently amplifies his character's motivations and demeanor.Yet the film's look is about the only thing about it that really sticks with you. The story doesn't reach the same delirious heights of it's trimmings, giving it's audience the same ""save the world"" filler we've seen ad nauseum. The difference here is the heroine plays with time-travel in a way that seems simultaneously convenient and lazy. How lazy you ask? Well at one point the entire plot of the movie, to say nothing of one character's future motivations seems to hinge on the smuggling of a tart.Mia Wasikowska acting instincts do manage to be much bolder and more interesting than the aloof supermodel detachment she seemed to imbue in the last film. Yet the Wonderland story betrays her by designating her as a vessel to witness things instead of a character with any sense of agency or will. Additionally the more head-strong Alice still doesn't bring the physicality required for either Wonderland or ""real world"". The first fifteen minutes of the film are meant to sell the audience on the idea that she's a down-and-out bad a** but her glaring daintiness conjures memories of Geena Davis in Cutthroat Island (1995). I'm sorry if it sounds harsh but Wasikowska can't play a salty sea captain (with a auspiciously form fitting gown) anymore than Danny DeVito can play Romeo.Boring, listless and lacking any narrative flair, Alice Through the Looking Glass is a paint by numbers hero story that can't help but feel as unnecessary as its prequel. It serves no purpose other than to entertain with bright lights and pretty colors while hammering home a message that could have been learned by the character within five minutes if she were treated less like a tourist and more like...you know, a character. But hey, Alice Through the Looking Glass is pretty to look at. So its got that going for it.",Alice Through the Looking Glass

I'm surprised that Tim Burton didn't make time in his schedule to direct this... all of those simmering sibling and daddy issues would make a good loose trilogy with Wonka and Big Fish...The film tries to tackle big themes within a kaleidoscopic world - but it winds up going through the motions, and, unfortunately for a film about Time, has the feeling of drag when it should zip.",Alice Through the Looking Glass
58,Screen_Blitz,"Alice Through the Looking Glass lavishes with colorful, eye-dazzling visuals that unfortunately fail compensate for its uninspired story",5,10 October 2017,"Tim Burton's reimagining of Lewis Carroll's 'Alice in Wonderland' in 2010 was far from anything special, but its ability to engage the audiences with its dazzling visual imagery in an effort to distract the director's drift from the familiarity of the source material proved to be enough to make a head-spinning earning at the box office. After sitting through this film's follow-up, which picks up shortly where the end of the film left off, I was only left pondering with the question of why a sequel was even remotely necessary. With Tim Burton reassigned to the producer's chair, James Bobin takes over the director's role in attempt to squeeze the small remaining juice out of the source material, but does with results that are a bit underwhelming to say the least. This film, following the eponymous character on yet another adventure through Wonderland dazzles with just about everything from the visuals to the quirky humor that made granted appeal to its predecessor except a satisfying story. What Bobin's leaves us with is more of a roller coaster ride through a cave of wacky cartoon imagery than a cohesive family fun picture. The film focuses on Alice (played by Mia Wasikowska) who disappears through a mirror and into the magical world of Wonderland where she reunites with the White Queen (played by Anne Hathaway), bobbled head twins Tweedledee and Tweedledum (both played by Matt Lucas), the chesire cat, and white rabbit. They inform her of the urgent news of the Mad Hatter (played by Johnny Depp) growing ill due to his depression of the loss of his family. To save the poor man from his fate, Alice must travel back in time with the help of Time ""himself"" (played by Sacha Baron Cohen) to change the course of events that led to the death of family at the hands of the Red Queen (played by Helena Bonham Carter).For a continuation on Lewis Carroll's classic source material, you would think that writer Linda Woolverton would come up with a premise little more thoughtful than what is sold here. Sadly, that is the only beginning of the misdeed that drives this fairy tale into diminishing effect. The best thing James Bobin's wrings out the picture is an overwhelming barrage of colorful visual design of the whimsical world of Wonderland completed with bloated CGI that pits Aussie actress Mia Wasikowska with the daunting task of interacting with mysterious creatures who only exist in the computer. Wasikowska manages to pull it off and Bobin's makes a fabulous attempt at springing the imaginative world to life. But for everything and everyone else though, that is another story. Wasikowska is left adrift in a story that, while has its moments, never gets truly engaging. The moments of excitement are scarce as the film pedaling swiftly from subplot to another without giving any of the classic supporting character a time to shine. It is especially disappointing for Johnny Depp's Mad Matter who stole the show in the previous film, and is succumbing to a performance that is more vexing than charming. If there is anyone even remotely as charming as Wasikowska here, it is Sacha Baron Cohen, giving a quirky impression of his loopy character. On the other hand, the fun is left to the climax when Alice and the rest of the characters are forced to make a daring attempt to save Wonderland as the entire place from ground is up is morphing into rust. It's too bad however, that lot of the pulse-pounding excitement is left buried under an uninspired plot while the visual effects are left to stand out with open arms. On the bright side, it does make a sweet visual ride with who happen to see this in 3-D.Alice Through the Looking Glass is an underwhelming fantasy ride that benefits from striking visual methodology that manages stick out among the uninspired mess of a story. That is not to say this doesn't make for a wholesome family entertainment, but there are certainly better options to say the least.",Alice Through the Looking Glass

I wish they (producers) did to Alice's universe what they did in Harry Potter's cinematization: something camp and fun, but that doesn't lose its solidity and maturity. But these are only my projections into something that is not within my reach. Maybe the intention was to do something for younger audiences, whatever. The thing is: I can see tremendous potential in the allegorical tale of the girl who fell down the rabbit hole. And I hope that someday she'll have a decent remake.",Alice Through the Looking Glass
62,RforFilm,Where's the Madness? Alice Through the Looking Glass unlogically tries for more logic.,3,31 May 2016,"Through the rabbit hole lies Wonderland, a world where there is no logic and the most curious of characters are here to encounter a girl named Alice, who does her best to make sense of her environment. Rhyme and reason are deconstructed in favor of total madness. Lewis Carroll figured early on that any rhyme and reason shouldn't play a role in his book Alice in Wonderland. Rather then a flowing story, we get a series of events, similar to a road trip story, simply about a young girl who runs into various creatures like the White Rabbit, Cheshire Cat, the Caterpillar, March Hare, The Mad Hatter, the Queen of Hearts, and the Jabberwocky dragon.The stories have been adapted many times, though my favorite is the animated Disney movie from 1951. That felt the closest to the random madness that the book was getting across. The biggest adaptation though is the Tim Burton Alice in Wonderland, that was anything but a word for word retelling. It was an odd blockbuster that put a young adult Alice into a political war and another prophecy plot that we've seen too often. It was creative at best, but forgettable at worse. Time to return to the Underland in Alice Through the Looking Glass.It has been about three years since Alice (played by Mia Wasikowska) took her journey and came back wanting to make a career through her fathers trading ship. She has now returned to London from China where she finds out that her ex-finance Hamish has taken over her fathers company and wants her ship in exchange for her family's home. Distraught on the issue, she encounters a butterfly as the former caterpillar Absolem (played by Alan Rickman) who leads her to a mirror that allows her to enter. This transports her through another mirror where she finds herself in Wonderland again.She eventually finds herself in the company of her old friends the White Rabbit (played by Michael Sheen), the Cheshire Cat (played by Stephen Fry), the Tweedles, the Dormouse, and the White Queen (played by Anne Hathaway). They tell her that the Mad Hatter has been acting more crazy then usual. Alice visits him, but the Hatter (played by Johnny Depp) asks her to leave. She finds out that the Hatter's family is what's been bothering him, so Alice finds the half man half clock Time (played by Sacha Baron Cohen) who has a machine that can allow her to time travel to find out what happened. Oh and the Red Queen (played by Helena Bonham Carter) is out for revenge.Alice Through the Looking Glass is a prime example on why you should read the script before geenlighting the project. Like how the last one was a political war movie, Alice should not be a time travel story either. In a world that's supposed to be illogical and nonsensical, time travel only sets more rules that make little sense. Not to mention that this movie is really lacking much of the madness that the animated movie has always gotten correctly. Alice is still a bore to follow. I've seen Mia Wasikowska give a good performance, but the emotion is so non-existent, that you question whether is was intentional. Everyone tries, but in a strange move by storytelling rules, the majority of the characters are only there to cheer Alice along. The only one I liked was Sacha Baron Cohen as Time who did get a laugh or two out of me. I just wish his character and environment was not in an Alice in Wonderland movie. The world of Wonderland is still creative and tries to throw a lot of visuals, but another problem is that the dilemma that Alice is trying to fix almost has no connection to her real world problem. In fact, the one time they go back to real world could have been cut out and nothing would have been missed!I'll give this three Tweedles out of ten. Alice Through the Looking Glass was not worth the six year wait (a long time considering that the last movie was a monster hit) and barley justifies a third return. I think it's time for Alice to get out of the Wonderland clouds and stay in the real world.",Alice Through the Looking Glass
63,Anurag-Shetty,Not as fun & enchanting as its predecessor.,7,31 May 2016,"Alice Through the Looking Glass continues with the adventures of Alice Kingsleigh(Mia Wasikowska). This film takes place, some time after the events of Alice in Wonderland(2010). Alice returns to Wonderland. Here, she finds out that the Hatter(Johnny Depp) has gotten himself into a life-threatening situation. Alice will have to travel back in time, to save the Hatter's life. She takes the help of her friends in Wonderland namely, Mirana(Anne Hathaway), Tweedledee/Tweedledum(Matt Lucas), Absolem(Alan Rickman), Bayard(Timothy Spall), Thackery(Paul Whitehouse), Cheshire Cat(Stephen Fry), Mallymkun(Barbara Windsor) & McTwisp(Michael Sheen). However, going back to the past to save the Hatter's life, puts Alice on a collision course, with Time(Sacha Baron Cohen) & her old enemy, Iracebeth(Helena Bonham Carter). Alice Through the Looking Glass is a good film. However, I liked Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland(2010) better. Don't worry though. This film is as visually stunning as its predecessor. It just lacks the non-stop adventure & humor, that made Alice in Wonderland(2010) thoroughly entertaining. The visual effects are otherworldly. The 3D is effective. I just think that on the whole, Alice in Wonderland(2010) is a more memorable film. I love the fact that we find out why our favorite characters, are how they are. Johnny Depp is awesome as Hatter Tarrant Hightopp. Mia Wasikowska is brilliant as Alice Kingsleigh. Helena Bonham Carter is outstanding as Iracebeth. Anne Hathaway is great as Mirana. Sacha Baron Cohen is spectacular as Time. Rhys Ifans is good as Zanik Hightopp. Matt Lucas is adorable as Tweedledee/Tweedledum. Alan Rickman, Timothy Spall, Paul Whitehouse, Stephen Fry, Barbara Windsor, Michael Sheen & Matt Vogel are excellent as the voices of, Absolem, Bayard, Thackery, Cheshire Cat, Mallymkun, McTwisp & Wilkins, respectively. Lindsay Duncan, Leo Bill, Andrew Scott, Richard Armitage & Ed Speelers are impressive as Helen Kingsleigh, Hamish, Dr. Addison Bennett, King Oleron & James Harcourt, respectively. Alice Through the Looking Glass is worth a watch, for fans of Alice in Wonderland(2010). Watch the film, with slightly lowered expectations.",Alice Through the Looking Glass
64,fernandoschiavi,James Bobin's direction and the less eccentric suitability of this world worked for me making the experience of watching the film quite fun and enjoyable,7,25 January 2021,"Linda Woolverton, one of the most traditional Disney screenwriters, returns to the role to work again with the characters created by Lewis Carroll, but it is very wrong to think that the adaptation of Alice in the Country of Mirrors is faithful. Woolverton's work follows the line of the previous text: totally free for creation. However, despite the studio betting on the screenwriter's imagination, she delivers a hot pocket script - the basics of the most basic, yet fun and fleeting. Lewis Carroll's book features crazy characters in a fantastic universe and the author gives even more depth to this world through nonsense poems. Alice Through the Looking Glass at Disney - directed this time by James Bobin - pulls any magic out of that place by explaining the insanity (and obsession with tea) of the characters and by summarizing all the conflicts in the film to family problems. In a universe as rich as Wonderland, trying to sum up all problems to topics as mundane as death and family makes the whole fantastic world lose its wonderful characteristics and become a mirror of our world, just including a palette of more vibrant colors.Alice Through the Looking Glass, like her predecessor, has very few references in the book. In this new story, the protagonist must race against time (literally against Time) to find out what happened to the Mad Hatter's family. Meanwhile, in the ""real"" world, Alice faces family problems and an oppressive society that believes that the fact that she is a woman makes her unable to run her father's business. Bobin and Woolverton manage to present a film that, while bringing interesting questions about time and in a small dose, the role of women in society, also amuses, entertains and is much more dynamic than its predecessor. Alice is a young, single, independent woman, commanding a boat, overcoming storms and beating pirates. She wears what she wants, not caring if she is going to shock someone, and she also challenges men of the time, refusing to be treated as incapable just because she is a woman, and rebelling against diagnoses of ""female hysteria"", something common in it was Victorian, a period in which the feature takes place. All the scenes of Alice in our world are much more unbelievable and inspiring than any minute she spends on the other side of the mirror trying to save the Hatter. Unfortunately, the feature is not called Alice Being Incredible in the Real World. The young woman spends very little time in her own reality and much of what we see on the big screen is precisely this Wonderland created by James Bobin.Taking the place of Tim Burton in the direction, the difference in pitch brought by James Bobin is felt immediately. Its action is more imaginative, the camera has a more participative and creative role, the atmosphere is lighter, the characters are less affected mainly by the White Queen and the Mad Hatter making them more pleasant and relevant within the film. The framings are rich, knowing very well how to fill the massive presence of the chroma key that brings life to Wonderland. Bobin also works with point of view issues more gracefully when Alice changes size on the journey. In fact, there is even a very expensive sequence plan during the explosive climax of the film that can well illustrate the sense of urgency, adventure and magic that perpetrated at the end of the journey.There is no great effort to build this story. The main highlight is the use of time travel that Alice performs with the aid of an apparatus of the pseudo-antagonist Tempo. In addition, the lighter and less somber tone than seen in Burton's film makes the tape much more enjoyable for the general public. Linda knows how to inject energy into the story whenever necessary. That is, at least three big twists manage to change the direction of the narrative taking it to even unexpected places in a select scene, very fast, but courageous for inferring such a vibrant contrast between the raw real world with that of the impossible imagination of Wonderland. .However, even with this curious twist in one of the twists, Woolverton weighs heavily on the use of clichés that end up making the film quite predictable, in addition to the expository verbiage that insists on explaining many obvious things - Alice is the one who most explains the film to the audience. Many relationships between new characters cannot escape this and many of the others even behave as mere supporting characters. The development on the journey, done properly, is restricted solely and exclusively to the family drama of the Queen of Hearts with the White Queen. Even though the Hatter's bow and his family are the driving force of the whole film, it is somewhat uncomfortable that it can be resolved with some ease, all by magic. With it, there is at least one interesting dramatic exercise on the narrative use of an item related to the character's childhood - even if it gives rise to yet another cliché conflict.The drama of the two sister queens does not escape from an already known structure or even a common question: ""If you had the opportunity to go back in time, would you prevent the existence of some genocidal tyrant?"". Obviously, because it is a children's film, this is very appeased and mixed with humor. Still with the interesting theme in this nucleus, it is sometimes better to leave stories of origin under the rugs. What Woolverton brings to explain the motivation for the Queen of Hearts' evil is, let's say, wasted. In fact, the motivation problems in the first film are practically solved here. Alice, Queen of Hearts, Mad Hatter, White Queen and Time have reasons, albeit weak, to act in favor of advancing the narrative. Tempo, unfortunately, is a weak character, of a single note, although the interpretation of the always cartoonish Sacha Baron Cohen gives energy to his mad pursuit against Alice. The script is quite contradictory in the repetitive phrases he says about being immortal when clearly, throughout the film, he loses strength. It can even be seen as an irony or a mocking speech about arrogance, but as the character does not learn during the journey, it is difficult to defend the rickety treatment. In fact, the Queen of Hearts' relocation in this adventure is strange and a little out of place after being banned in the previous film. Woolverton has little interest in explaining this to the public.Technically, the film matches Tim Burton's film. The visual effects and creatures are magnificent once again. Taking advantage of this journey before, during and after the Queen of Hearts' reign, Bobin, photographer Stuart Dryburgh and production designer Dan Hennah hit the nail on the head in this film's impeccable look. From the gloomy conception full of Gothic architecture crammed with clocks in the palace of Time to the heyday of a more cheerful, lively and colorful Wonderland. Highlight, of course, for the tea table, now impeccable as it should be with full sweets and cakes, shiny silverware and refined porcelain escaping Burton's defeatist and depressed conception. This attention to detail with the visual and art direction is what really elevates the film. Even though Dryburgh does not risk creating visual metaphors that run away from the basics, the diverse color palette is praiseworthy, in addition to the more inspired lighting using demarcated backlights to create true ""painted"" plans on the canvas - an example of this is where Tempo controls the clocks. ""Life"" of every citizen of the magical world.The cast weighs a lot in favor of the work. Wasikowska is forced to say regrettable phrases - ""How will I live without the impossible? ""-, but she doesn't abandon her character, which gives the least credibility to the worlds that surround her. The actress seems to have learned a lot since 2010 and delivers an Alice with more personality and much more charisma than we saw previously. Helena Bonham Carter, who returns as Queen of Hearts, and Sacha Baron Cohen, who debuts as Time, are the only ones capable of entertaining the long way to the end of the film, easing the uncomfortable insistence on Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter. Entitled to family drama, the character takes center stage to make the other inhabitants of Wonderland his luxury troupe, including Anne Hathaway's White Queen and Alan Rickman's ultimate work as the former Blue Caterpillar.Alice Through the Looking Glass is an unimaginative film that tries to answer questions that have never been asked. The only plausible reason for this continuation to exist is a response to the success achieved in the first feature. Perhaps all the disasters in the film that happen in Alice's fight against Time could have been avoided if Alice in the feature had heard a phrase from the protagonist of Lewis Carroll's book, in which the little girl says that there is no use going back to yesterday, because even so she was a different person. Anyway, this is a product that brings a little more of it, but full of charisma. Bobin's direction and the less eccentric suitability of this world worked for me making the experience of watching the film quite fun and enjoyable. However, even so, the weak script takes away the technical brilliance. For children, it is still a great choice, after all it is a quick, easy and harmless entertainment. And very expository.",Alice Through the Looking Glass
65,swilliky,Through the Looking Glass is fun and cute but unnecessary,5,29 May 2016,"A sequel six years later won't garner much attention at the box office, but Alice Through the Looking Glass is a fun, cute movie with colorful imagery and a goofy time travel tale. Mia Wasikowska reprises her role as the titular Alice and does a could job as the curious and friendly girl just hoping to save her fantasy world from the trappings of time. The recently troubled actor Johnny Depp dresses up in a custom that might be more fitting to take part in a horror movie than a children's fantasy film to return as the Mad Hatter. The story centers around the Mad Hatter's desire to reconnect with his family who were believed burnt up by the Jabberwocky, a dragon ordered around by the Red Queen.Also returning, though next bringing her ex-husband to the director's chair, is Helen Bonham Carter as the big-headed Red Queen with a bad attitude and a pension for chopping off heads of those who displease her. Anne Hathaway is the White Queen and they all go by other names, but the world is too confusing to understand them beyond their iconic images. The cutest creature, and my favorite, is most definitely the Cheshire Cat, voiced by Stephen Fry.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",Alice Through the Looking Glass

70,James_De_Bello,4/10,4,25 May 2016,"The emotional dryness of ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" is so vast and unsettling it made my head ache. Not even a talented and experienced director like James Bobin could manage to save one of the most disastrous screenplay ever to be adapted in recent memory, bringing to the screen a story that is duller and more uninteresting than its predecessor (which is saying something) and makes no justice to Lewis Carroll's rich world.This movie admittedly has a couple of things going for it: firstly it is never so bad I got angry at it, it is just boring to the point that it made me feel dizzy every five minutes and I'm sure I lost something in the mix because my eyes were constantly about to close. But we were talking positives: James Bobin demonstrates he is a good director here, he makes whatever is possible to make out of this mess. The integration of practical effects with CGI is definitely improved over the first film, the design and color is definitely the element that saves the film from an abyss of dullness. There are also some remarkable visual cues here and there that show Bobin's eye for cinema and comedy. Helena Bonham-Carter is as always entertaining and has just a couple of really funny moments, plus the score I must admit is quite good.And that's it. For the rest we are treated to an assault to our brain that has one of the most incoherent and despicable stories I have ever had the displeasure to experience. It is so mind bending how bad this is from its basic story structure it deserves a whole beat-by-beat analyzed commentary to teach what's wrong for story. Every line or action could be literally ripped apart, I never ever felt a genuine emotional connection with anybody, I was never given a reason to do so.Characters exposing the plot constantly, a whole throwaway sequence where Andrew Scott appears out of nowhere for sixteen seconds for absolutely no reason, an incoherence of internal story logic that goes beyond what I can explain, a story message that is so confused and nonexistent the movie literally turns it around for itself, a plot that dictates story at every turn, predictability in every single climactic moment, suddenly there are transformers in the Alice universe, character relations being so undramatic they start to look like parodies, you name it this movie has it all, I could not believe it, it was frustratingly boring and if there's one thing a blockbuster, visual extravaganza film should not be, it is exactly that.Disney has had its first terrible quality flop in sometime and its a real down step, I am sorry for all the talent involved which I am a fan of, but this film is not recommendable, child, kid or adult I can't see what anyone would find to enjoy here.",Alice Through the Looking Glass
71,scottshak_111,Surprisingly good!,7,21 July 2016,"If Lewis Carroll would have been alive today he would have given a nod to Alice Through the Looking Glass. Of course not for the reason that they totally changed his book and messed with every single detail to weave something different altogether, but for the mere fact that it is brimming up with an equal fanciful inclination and zeal that Carroll shared.THE CONCEPT OF TIME Alice Through the Looking Glass personifies 'Time' which is both poetic and enigmatic as Alice embarks on a journey to bring Hatter back to life. Time's depiction is downright extraordinary and aced superbly by Sacha Baron Cohen. The blue tinge in his eyes and his animated mechanical body help him lip a fantastic creation.""Time is a thief, and a villain."" There are a lot of time references that have been brilliantly thought of and executed nicely. Watch out for that bit when Time is made fun of by Hatter, Cheshire Cat, Thackery, Mallymkun and the rest. The movie packs in the concept of toying with timelines, which happens to be one of my favourite fancies. Unfortunately they fail to make it palpable.ALICE THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS REVIVING CHARACTERS You get to hear the voice of Alan Rickman as Absolem which was endearing per se as if he sprang up back from the dead. It was ephemeral but it makes you think of him which was really pleasant. Mia Wasikowska is as outstanding as she was in the prequel. So was Helena Bonham Carter as Iracebeth. Her rampaging confidence is a joy to watch. Also, Andrew Scott has a short cameo, that was actually quite satisfying.Screenplay is kind of a beautiful literary affair, and will keep you interested throughout. Visually it is gripping. The plot oscillates a little betwixt the real and the virtual but finds a firm grip in both the worlds. Well thought of, I must say. It isn't really that dark and grim as Tim Burton's style of movie-making is. But it is still fun.CURIOUS SPOILERS AHEAD: The thing that seemed a little out of place in Alice Through the Looking Glass was the huge plot punch on which the whole movie was based upon. If you look at it closely you wonder Alice goes to all that trouble just to make Hatter, who is already mad, happy? Is that it? To answer that you must think from Alice's perspective. It is this whimsical world she tries to fit in, and petty things that entail in it that matter to her the most. If one was to weave a story out of her life, it would always surround tales with such quaint things, things that matter to Alice, if not to you. Well, if you can't digest that, a simple – ""Hatter was going to die with gloom"" should do it.OTHER DOWNSIDES Alice Through the Looking Glass isn't really that serious when trying to skip alongside the time component that it so profusely tries to milk. It will flabbergast you beyond limit, vex you if you try to connect the dots, and elude you as you try to reason with it. At the end of the flick you realize it's Disney after all. What do you expect? Eventually, you wonder if Alice Through the Looking Glass even came close to how Lewis had intended his book to be, but to be honest there are more creative juices at play in today's fantasy scenario.

72,coreyjdenford,Curious and Curiouser,6,1 June 2016,"My review of Alice Through the Looking Glass (Spoiler free)*** (3 stars) Cast: Johnny Depp, Mia Wasikowska, Anne Hathaway, Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron-Cohen Plot: Alice returns to the whimsical world of Wonderland and travels back in time to save the Mad Hatter.All the original cast return to this garish sequel to Tim Burton's unexpectedly all conquering 2010 Alice In Wonderland. Though the original film had a sort of serious tone to it, the sequel decides to go much darker and a lot more silly which isn't a bad thing. We all know what Disney are like with sequels to, in this case originally OK-ish movies.The film is full of clichés and one that particularly stuck out was when Alice, made a conveniently placed Humpty-Dumpty fall off a chess table. It follows the story from the book very well it just falls flat after the first hour.Mia Wasikowska's Alice maybe more brave but she is also more clumsy, the Mad Hatter (Depp) is more irritating than the first and the real stand out performance comes from Sacha Baron-Cohen, who puts on a very convincing Werner Herzogian German accent as Time, so instead of calling him Father Time he should change his name to Furher Time.Here are some points as to why this is an OK sequel: From book to film: The film follows the book well but after the first half-an-hour to an hour the story in the film starts to fall apart, the book is a lot more serious an dark. The film is dark but as I've already said silly especially with Time, you see him making a cool-ish entrance and then falling over which is funny but over done.Working Factor: This is in term of Johnny Depp's character the Mad Hatter with the original film it felt that he was necessity, but with this not so much in fact it would have been better if he wasn't in it, or if Disney didn't do it at all.Landscape: The landscape is the only good factor in this film because the landscape is gorgeous especially Time's castle which is just, the part of the landscape which particular beautiful it's more of a room and the room of watches which is just a design triumph. Other than that James Bobin's Wonderland looks exactly like the first.Bad Points Over done gimmicks: The gimmicks more alternatively things that happen are all over done the main thing being that Time is extremely clumsy, which is over done especially with him falling off his convenient flying bike, when it happened once it was funny and in this case maybe gimmicks should only be done once.Clichés, clichés and more clichés: With Disney films the use of clichés is predictable but this film uses more clichés than the average Disney film. There are too many to count but if I was to pick one it would be Humpty-Dumpty see above.As far as sequels go this isn't the worst but it certainly isn't the best, it's entertaining if a little silly. The film only occasionally enchants which is just a shame. It could have better but other than that it's an entertaining experience.Verdict: Wasikowska gives it her all, while Cohen shines in this silly but still entertaining sequel that won't leave you feeling out of pocket. Will leave you feeling more curious than the first time round.6/10 good but not great.",Alice Through the Looking Glass
73,jamiedarlow-37510,A surprising delight :),6,8 February 2020,"Much better than the first (quite rare for a sequel!) Visually, it is an absolute treat. One of the most colourful films of the year! The cast is just as impressive as in the last one. Mia Wasikowska is increasingly good in the role of Alice. Johnny Depp is clearly still having fun as the Mad Hatter which is a pleasure to see. However what I liked most about this was that all the characters get more involved in the action and there is a lovely message about working together and helping out others through the film. There's a wonderful panning shot two thirds through the film of all our heroes marching forward and reaching their goal which was equally funny as well as uplifting. A particular highlight for me was Sacha Baron Cohen as Time; really funny and a brilliant character. James Bobin is certainly a director to watch from his work in Flight of the Conchords and Muppets Most Wanted (one of the funniest films I've seen at the cinema in recent years) and now with Alice Through the Looking Glass; one of the more light-hearted and enjoyable blockbusters of the year",Alice Through the Looking Glass
74,jawneyfloros,A terrible sequel to a great movie,2,4 November 2018,Review: I enjoyed this movie but felt it was lacking something that I can't seem to put my finger on.

All in all I would give this two out of a possible five stars.,Alice Through the Looking Glass
75,kermitkid,Vast improvement,9,30 March 2020,"I'm glad to see Tim Burton learned from his mistakes of the first one. While the first one felt like ""Lord of the Rings,"" and had way too much fantasy, this one actually feels like the source material. It's an original story, but still feels like the world of Wonderland. It didn't really feel like a Tim Burton movie. For one, there's color. Also, the visual imagery in this movie looked like something Robert Rodreguiz would make. That's a good thing, though because it's fantastic. The story was intriguing, the villian was comedic while still being somewhat threatening, the action was exciting, it was just an all around fun film. However, there is one thing that bugs me. Making Alice an action heroine. There's nothing wrong with strong female characters in movies, as long as it fits that world, like with Marvel or Star Wars. But when it's in a movie like this, it feels forced. Also, the White Queen apparently can't talk without fluttering her hands. It's very distracting and looks ridiculous. Compared to the first film, this one is actually pretty good. I was genuinely surprised by how much I liked this. It was enthralling! It's what the first movie should have been.
Grade: A- 9/10. 4/5",Alice Through the Looking Glass
76,Rendanlovell,Nothing more than a cash grab.,3,3 June 2016,"Honestly, I'm rather surprised that this sequel didn't come sooner than this. Considering that the first 'Alice' film, directed by Tim Burton, made over One Billion dollars. No, you didn't read that wrong, that film made over $1,000,000,000. So, of course this movie was bound to happen. Even though it took six years to make 'Alice 2' feels like it was rushed into existence. This is undoubtedly one of the most convoluted and nonsensical films I have seen in quite some time. But this one puts the worst Johnny Depp character of all time in the for front. The film opens with Alice captaining a boat for some reason. Why she is doing this, who knows! After that, some stupid nonsense happens and she ends up in Wonderland, again. Unlike the first time, The Mad Hatter is sick. He randomly happens across a relic from his past and he, out of no where, is sad about it. He thinks that his dead family is some how still alive and since no one believes him he obviously gets really sick.So, Alice steals some gizzmo from Time and journeys to the past to try and fix the Hatter. If my explanation made no sense, that's okay, because this movie makes no sense. There is absolutely no reason for it to exist at all and yet, here we are. Stuck with yet another Disney cash grab.The only saving graces of this film is in it's music and the occasional nifty sequence. Other than those two things, this film is a disaster. Not only does this film try to be a sequel but a prequel too. It jumps between past, present, reality, and wonderland so much that if you don't leave with a throbbing headache you were probably asleep.There is so much that 'Alice 2' is trying to do all at once. It tries to be a direct sequel but since it has no where to go with that it journeys to the past and becomes a pointless prequel. Ever wonder how your favorite characters became the way they are? No? Well to bad, this is how literally every main character became the person you know and hopefully love.The film is trying so hard to justify its existence with meaningless nonsense that it's almost sad. It barrages its viewers with enough CGI and color to make the strongest willed person crack. Whats worse is that all of this feels halfheartedly done. The CGI is so incredibly lazy that many scenes are just an actor or two in front of an obvious green screen. They never try to integrate it into environments, but instead throw their actors in front of countless green screens and pray you don't notice.When you do this to your actors it makes their performances incredibly unconvincing. You could have the greatest actor ever but if you put him in front of a green you are automatically diminishing his performance. Every single actor looks either bored or completely lost. Throw in a bad director and you get some really cringy scenes. Like when an actor is looking the complete opposite way of the thing they are suppose to be looking at.There is so much wrong with this film that it's near impossible to put it all in words. The CGI that dominates the majority of the screen is as bland as the story that is being shoved in our faces. Nothing makes any sense, there is far to much going on, and it all amounts to zero, nothing. It is so forgettable and boring that it may as well have never happened. I can't believe I am saying this, but just watch the first one again instead of this pile of steaming garbage.",Alice Through the Looking Glass

79,ayoreinf,Way too preachy for its own good,7,30 May 2016,"I never minded the re-imagining of Alice in Wonderland, especially as Tim Burton was honest about doing it. It was fun. It was true to the characters as they were created by Lewis Carroll. It did create a wonderland, and that's much more than simple good CGI. So it was successful, often a big mistake in the world of Hollywood. If you make money, they'll never let you die. So another story was written this time a re-imagining of the 2nd Book Carroll dedicated to his young heroine. Once again Burton proves he knows when to call it quits. He does remain as a producer but not as a director. And as the movie moves on the difference between the 1st part and the 2nd becomes all too evident. the last 10 minutes of the film are in fact one long lecture, Alice and us are being force fed with one moral lesson after the other. Well Alice is inside the movie she has to swallow it and smile. We on the other hand being captive audience in the movie theater while we're still forced to swallow the same stuff, we're not required to smile. I know I certainly didn't.It wasn't as funny and imaginative as the first part but before the preachy ending it was doing OK. The acting was still superb, the setting still looked great, and Sacha Baron Cohen proved again that when his comic genius is being kept under control he's a decent actor. But then it became educational: I can honestly say that almost the entire ending had a hollow ring echoing through it.",Alice Through the Looking Glass
80,darkreignn,Alice is average at best,5,31 May 2016,"""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" is the newest Disney film, full of colour, adventure, and whimsical visuals. Well, at least that's what you'd think from the trailer. Unfortunately, there's not much to say about this film. It's just an average fantasy adventure. It's very safe, it's light, it's just really mediocre. It's not bad, it's not good, it just is. The film features the titular Alice, who once fell down a rabbit hole, and now walked through a looking glass. Now, Alice is a sailor, and the movie starts off exciting enough with Alice evading a group of pirates who are stalking her ship on the high seas. But eventually she finds herself back in Wonderland, having to travel back in time to try and save the family of the Mad Hatter from a grisly fate.Unfortunately, the story is just mediocre. It's not particularly exciting, or interesting, or engaging. And speaking of the story, it makes too much sense. Wonderland isn't supposed to make sense, and it's not supposed to be easy to follow, and Disney making the movie so incredibly average and straightforward dumbed-down what could have been an incredible experience through a fantastical and insane world of imagination. The movie moves at a steady pace, and never feels slow, but halfway through the movie I really wanted it to end, not because I was excruciatingly bored, but because I just wanted to do something else. And when a movie can't even hold your attention, especially a movie that boasts a Wonderland as a setting, you know that's a bad sign. And unfortunately, I think other movie goers were bored with the film as well, because I haven't seen this many bathroom breaks in a movie ever.Even the visuals are average in this film. There are a few really cool shots in the beginning of the film when Alice first enters into her fantasy world, but these shots are all spoiled in the trailers. After this, it just looks like any other fantasy land that could have been in any other movie. It doesn't feel like Wonderland. Seriously, if the main character wasn't named ""Alice,"" no one would even know this was supposed to be a story based off of Alice in Wonderland. I promise you that if this film was randomly on television one night and you accidentally stumbled upon it, at first glance you wouldn't even know it was an Alice in Wonderland story; you'd just think it's a generic, made for TV, fantasy adventure. Disney really had an opportunity here. They could've made this film great if they would've made it a bit darker, a little more adult, and added more of the craziness that I assumed they were going to add, based off of the trailers. (They only hinted at Alices' insanity midway through this film in a scene that is shown in the trailers but that I will not spoil, but after that scene it is never mentioned ever again.) However, this is just an average, mediocre, straightforward, and serviceable fantasy adventure that you can watch and then immediately forget about.",Alice Through the Looking Glass
81,TheOne746,A film lacking Tim Burton's flair from the original.,6,31 October 2020,"This film was very entertaining as someone who was interested in the sequel to Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland. It lacks the Tim Burton touch, but it still hangs on its own. If something has remained a constant in these two films is that the cinematographies are gorgeous, with every trip to Wonderland looking colorful and like paintings. The third act impressed me when I thought Wonderland would be doomed, but it didn't happen. The visual effects in the third act are a masterclass, and I'm impressed they didn't get nominated for an Oscar like the original.
In conclusion I liked this film a lot. If you like time travel stories, I don't think you will be insanely disappointed by this film, unless you don't like the fantasy from this franchise. Mia Wasikowsa still remains, in my opinion, magnificently cast as Alice. The supporting characters have less time (pun intended) to work with on this film, and that's a letdown compared to the original in which they were better. Overall, this movie felt like a spinoff for Alice and the Mad Hatter since they are the core of the story and nothing else. It is a letdown compared to the original, because it lacks Tim Burton's flair but still manages to be entertaining thanks to the colorful world, the lead in Mia Wasikowska, and great visual effects. This movie is slightly worse than the original so I give this film a 6.5/10. I gave the original a 7/10, because the art direction was just so beautiful and it was one of the Oscar wins that it desevedly won thanks to Tim Burton's vision. I really wish this movie had been a better success with it not making almost anything from the budget, compared to the original making a billion on the box office. It still manages to be entertaining so give it a shot if interested.",Alice Through the Looking Glass
82,FelipeCarrillo,"""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" Is Shamelessly Worse Than Its Predecessor",7,5 June 2016,"""Alice in Wonderland"" directed by Tim Burton was a flawless success at the box office in 2010, and with just reasons, the colorful and Gothic style of the team managed to give them two Academy Awards (for Art Direction and Costume Design) . Lewis Carroll's classics have been adapted to the big screen eleven times, and apparently it is feasible creation of other few. The scarcity of the sequel is Burton, his absence is irrefutable and although works as executive producer, his imagination and taste cries out for the reins of the film. This time, James Bobin (The Muppets) is director, his vision is broad and great-looking, but comparisons with Burton make presence on each frame evidenced. It seems that Disney forgets that it is better win a victory that a failure because of the ambition.From a screenplay written by Linda Woolverton, adapted to the books of Lewis Carroll, ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" presents to an Alice (Mia Wasikowska) a little more older - really - returning of offshore after three years, preserving the illusion of return to sea. But her hopes are frustrated when her former aspiring boyfriend, Hamish (obnoxious and pretentious played by Leo Bill) takes over the boat her father and her house, inciting her to sell the important boat, stay with the house and with a humiliating and discriminatory work. Alice's problems do not stop there, the blue caterpillar (Alan Rickman, deceased and respected actor) visits her to seduce her to resolve certain matters of her interest in the Wonderland. After an characteristic entrance of the Carroll books, Alice faces a terrible - and stupid, excuse the expression - news, her friend, the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) is slowly dying. The only solution to restore the vitality of the eccentric young is go back in time and help to recover his family apparently dead, experiencing millions of adventures and eccentricities, accompanied by spectacular landscapes and performances for nothing unpleasant. A small sub-plot is seen to involved in the story of Alice, the truth behind the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) and her sister, the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter), an interesting addition to the footage.The story is one of the fundamental obstacles, lack of a strong and wide idea, makes that the 113 minutes of duration becomes tedious, stressful and the worst soporific, making viewers to cover their mouths, but not of amazement, of boredom. It seemed as if Disney had chosen to adapt the drafts of the wastepaper basket of Carroll, yeah, they wanted that Hatter had importance in the plot, but the magic disappeared. A work of such magnitude should be edited precisely, but this time, they exaggerated.Fantasy and adventure sequences are indeed impressive, accompanied by an exaggerated, but required use of visual effects, minor or equivalent to the of its predecessor. However, the lush visual effects aren't the sufficiently skilled to hide a slow pace, an inconsistent script and a pale and slight story.Characters are distorted and dispel - some - of its strict behavior in books, however, Alice, Mad Hatter and the Red Queen steal all eyes. I'm in total disagreement that the role played by Mia Wasikowska is uniform, awkward and boring, not alluding to books and hampering adaptation, I believe that she is the precise woman for the role and if at some point has failed is the fault of the scriptwriters. Our blue caterpillar performed by professional and king of the acting ,Alan Rickman, was spectacular, serene and substantial, worthy of a so complete and amazing career of a man and an actor who will always be in the heart of the world, rest in peace, Alan.This is the first time that Disney surprises, and not in the way that everyone thinks. With a clear influence of female discrimination in Hollywood and the capacity to decide, Bobin and Woolverton had to leave their idea, just like that, an idea. Slow, lacking of the energy, palpitating continuity and charisma of its predecessor, ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" offers a visually majestic spectacle, however, they confused the audience with babies, we are not stupid, so many colors and singularities lack narrative imagination, I think that the 'Wonder' disappeared.",Alice Through the Looking Glass
83,Chalice_Of_Evil,"We're through the looking glass here, people",6,25 May 2016,"As one of the seemingly few people who actually really enjoyed Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland, I was hoping I'd enjoy this sequel too. Sadly, it falls quite short of the first film (so those who hated it should probably steer clear of this one). We begin promisingly enough, with some time having passed since the end of the last film, with Alice now captaining her father's ship, 'The Wonder', pursued by pirate ships on a dark and stormy night through the Straits of Malacca in 1874. This gloomy opening is quite thrilling and puts the openings of the last two Pirates of the Caribbean movies to shame. One year later, and she's still adventurous/free-spirited as ever, wearing a stunning technicolour Mandarin outfit she discovered on her travels and sticking it to the uppity folks, including the slimy Hamish (whose views/opinions of Alice/women sadly reflect those of a certain group of individuals even *nowadays*). He's still holding a grudge regarding her not marrying him (though I don't blame her). I actually didn't mind this opening scene and the other ones set in the 'real world'. Having said that, it's a relief that not before long, Alice is being led by Absolem (the voice of the late Alan Rickman, who there's a dedication for at film's end), now in butterfly form, through a magical looking glass and finding herself back in Underland/Wonderland.Maybe it's the fact that the original film was my first 3D movie I saw, but I remember being wondered by the effect of Alice's falling through the rabbit's hole and how that felt, whereas this time around it was much less effective and there just seemed to be a lack of 'magic' (and not just because I didn't see this one in 3D). After Alice accidentally shatters Humpty Dumpty, she's soon reunited with her old wacky friends (all of whom I was glad to see again...except for that damn annoying dormouse who I STILL hate). However, her closest friend, the Mad Hatter, has apparently lost his ""muchness"" due to the loss of his family in the past. It's not long before Alice seeks out Time, who is a ""he"", and nicks his time travel device called the 'Chronosphere' to change the past and reunite the Hatter with his family. As we all know, time travel is a tricky thing, and sure enough things go awry for our plucky heroine.Whilst I never had a problem with Wasikowska's performance in the first film, I'll admit that she does seem somewhat 'livelier' in this (maybe in part due to her looking less deathly pale this time around on account of James Bobin instead of Tim Burton as director?). She manages to make Alice more 'mature', but at the same time never loses *her* ""muchness"". She also makes mistakes...quite a few, actually. However, her determination to set everything right ensures that she doesn't turn into a villain (which is exactly what she'd thought of Time as being. Though it becomes clear that he isn't one either, and instead just wanting to maintain 'balance'). Whilst I found his first line amusing, his buffoonery behavior doesn't provide that much genuine humour (and his 'miniscule artisans', which can join together like Transformers' Constructicons, are annoying). Sacha Baron Cohen's portrayal, when he's allowed to play things more 'serious', is not half bad. I liked that he wasn't just a one-dimensional 'bad guy'. The theme of the characters not being what they might first appear also extends to the Red and White Queens. The first film never really explained how Iracebeth (Helena Bonham Carter, who's still a riot) came to be so angry/crazy/big-headed, but this one does...and it has everything to do with her sister, Mirana (played to perfection by Anne Hathaway, still as amusing as ever with her gliding about and floaty hand gestures), not being as saintly as she appears. Thanks to Alice's various trips through time, we're treated to seeing the sisters' younger selves and where their animosity began. I don't suddenly dislike Johnny Depp (despite the whole ""Terriergate"" thing) like many people seem to do now regarding the roles he plays, and I think he does as much as he can with the material given for the Hatter character. The film's plot kind of revolves around him, and it tries hard to evoke some feelings from the audience regarding the theme of 'family'. While I do admire the efforts, perhaps more time could've been spent making this theme become fully realized and less on crazy hijinks. While the visuals are quite dazzling, especially the sequences involving Alice's sailing through the seas of time, the over- reliance on CGI gets a bit tiresome after a while. As does the 'wackiness' of the Hatter, his tea party guests and Time, who share a tea party scene that could've been trimmed down and better spent on character development. There's a 'steampunk' vibe to all of the stuff regarding Time (the sea of dangling pocket watches that represent peoples' lives is especially eye-catching/interesting, as is the red crustiness of the climax), and it all makes for interesting visuals, but the story seems rather lacking. After Time's introduction, I found my interest waning off and on. Although, after Alice woke up in the mental hospital, which seemed like a major setback on her journey, ironically things seemed to pick up the pace again. However, this was getting towards the last third of the film. The use of score and callbacks from the first film, as well as the interesting costumes and retro feel of the pictures used for the end credits (a nod to the original illustrations?) were welcome. The use of a Pink song? Not so much. I still stand by my opinion of the first film being enjoyable, but sadly even I must admit this one doesn't match it in quality. There's some decent stuff here, but it seems to get lost in amongst all that which is unnecessary.",Alice Through the Looking Glass
84,PetarNeo,Falls in every area,4,4 October 2016,"After first movie made a huge surprise and hit 1 billion mark it was obvious there is going to be a second movie and it was not even close to the first one.

There are minor tries to get some characters like Hatters family but it's all quickly played and you just don't look at them as you are shifted onto new subject or plot line. Only things amazing is visual experience which fails to best in some moments but is really amazing specially at the when everything seems to rust and gets covered by it.

""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" isn't rocket science, it's just a good family film filled with colorfully special effects, a familiar storyline and good acting - regardless of what many a film critic are saying. If anything didn't quite fit into the fantasy environment of the film, it was the closing credits song by vocal artists Pink. Where the film places one firmly in a fantasy environment, Pink's song is too current, thus pulling one away from the established dream-state.

87,MinistryofDoom,Classic Example of Hollywood Execs doing a Sequel JUST FOR $$$$$$,2,4 October 2016,"Five words: ""What did I just watch?""This movie is terrible. It has a lot of great actors but great actors don't make a great movie. For that you need, for starters, a great director and a great script. Two things that this movie does not have. This should have been developed and directed by Tim Burton, not someone else who doesn't cost the studio as much to take on the job. The story is incoherent, which is strange because if they had just stuck to the original story of ""Through the Looking Glass, and What Alice Found There"" by Lewis Carroll and adapted that to the screen, it could have been something spectacular. Instead, they decided to use the ""looking glass"" as a launch point for a semi-original script that barely touches on the works of Lewis Carroll. In this film, Alice comes back from a trip and finds out that her family's estate is under threat and so she must fight to recover her family's estate but then she goes into Wonderland/Underland and there she's set on an adventure to save the Mad Hatter's family and change history and time. WHAT? None of this has anything to do with the actual ""Through the Looking Glass"" story. Another problem with this movie, and this carries over from the previous film, is that the actress who plays Alice, Mia Wasikowska, is bland and uninteresting. She lacks the skilled emotional range for film making and barely has 2 default expressions that she reuses constantly. I found myself very uninterested in her performance.

I'm surprised this sequel took six years in the making, regarding the tonne of money it made. By now we should have had a movie every year for Alice in Wonderland: spin- off, sequel, and prequel involving the Cheshire Cat. As its predecessor, this film is visually awesome, time travel and changing the past in Alice in Wonderland : this could be epic - this sounds definitely epic to me. As a whole, the movie has a great message: the importance of family, of being yourself, not what the world tell you-you should be and making your own path.I get that Wonderland might be an odd place but when all actors are acting insane - even the one supposed to be sane - it starts to get a little weirder than usual. Films are hard to make so I'm not going yo trash the director and being able to direct actors is tough as well, but I really noticed the lack of emotional consistency most likely due to bad acting. On a plus note, Sacha Baron Cohen character is efficient, he's actually not a proper villain, he's just Time and I won't spoil anything but you can clearly see Alice as the villain here. However, Helena Bonham Carter screaming and shouting all the time really gets to me after two movies of the same thing. Finally, the film itself looks like animation. Which is pretty weird when you realise actors are eventually alone on a green screen. They're many plots in this film and sometimes it gets overwhelming and you lose that wonder, you're no longer swept away in this world where wonder exist, where awe is so important and one man happiness creates an entire death trap that could literally collide the entire universe.

90,SpoilerAlertReviews,At the end of time..,7,28 May 2016,"The whole cast returns from Alice in Wonderland (2010) but with Tim Burton taking a producer seat and letting Muppet Director James Bobin take the reins, no offence. With a couple of additions, one being Sacha Baron Cohen who incidentally previously worked with Bobin on most of his Ali G series. The other addition being Rhys Ifans playing the Hatter's father. It opens well, and considering it's all about time travel it's paced rather well too. It's incredibly crazy-colourful especially the dress Alice wears to the party. And Bobin does good keeping the same feel as its predecessor, but I think that's got a lot to do with the cast. The colour makes a great contrast for the darker moments which are plentiful. Sacha plays the personified character of Time and he does exceptionally well. His clockwork castle and minions look impressive, transforming seconds into minutes and minutes into hours; even his Iron Mannish bodyworks look spectacular. My favourite set of the picture. The rest of all-star cast reprise their roles respectful though again, Helena Bonham Carter is amazing. Has a 'done-before' time travel scenario but that's forgivable ultimately being a family film, it's easy to follow and gives an interesting back story to the former Queen of Hearts, Iracebeth and carries an important moral message about wanting to change the past.The climatic conclusion with the end of time was fantastic, really enjoyed looking at how everything was getting taken over and coming to a complete rustic stop. Just that scene alone was worth the whole movie. Thought predictable I still enjoyed it. Carrying much from the first film, it reminded me very much of The Return To Oz (1985) especially of Tik-Tok. Also Labyrinth (1986) and the poor sequels to The Neverending Story (1984) (would actually welcome a reboot of Neverending Story.) Depp's MadHatter reminded me of American Comedian Carrot Top! It's an average film, easy-going entertainment but definitely below par for a Disney movie. Just lacked character investment, I didn't feel any empathy for any of the characters. Maybe I'm becoming too cold-hearted or maybe the old cast look, tired.

91,michaelhirakida,It's All About The Time.,8,30 May 2016,"If you couldn't tell, Alice Through The Looking Glass is about time itself. There is even a person named Time played by Sacha Baron Cohen. I like the idea of time in this movie. He ends peoples lives by closing stopwatches and puts the stopwatches in the deceased section of his castle. But he is probably the most inept character in the whole entire film. Before I begin talking about what I liked, let me tell you what me and my sister (who went to see the film with me) really disliked. The movie is extremely preachy with it's message. It hammers it into are heads giving us brain damage in the process. The message of Time is precious is a dumb and obvious message. OF COURSE TIME IS PRECIOUS! Who wouldn't think that? The whole movie is Alice traveling in time. Time trying to restore time. Alice trying to restore time. Saving the universe from time itself. It is the most ridiculous thing ever.Why do we have to have this overused and obnoxious message slammed into our faces? I like messages in movies that are vague. The Lego Movie which I continue to talk about to this day has a very great message but it's also vague enough for everyone to see. This movie is too preachy and tells us the message right away at the beginning of the movie and has extremely heavy handed symbolism to play with.Now that I have gotten that out of the way, the movie is absolutely ridiculous even for an Alice in Wonderland movie. The whole film has a story that is to stupid for it's own good. Johnny Depp's Hatter character you can barely hear what he is saying. It's like hes trying to add a T and a H to every sentence he says. The movie has way to predictable lines and twists that most people can see coming from miles away. The movie is dumb. That's what I'm trying to say.I would say from what I have told you that it's a so bad it's good movie, but in fact, I mostly enjoyed a lot of moments in the film in all seriousness. The colors and visuals are much more sharper and cleaner then it's 2010 counterpart which is a huge refreshment, Helena Bonham Carter's Red Queen is fun and has more character. I enjoyed the scenes with younger versions of the Wonderland characters.But unfortunately, some of the acting is stuff you would see in a Wachowski Siblings film. Dry, Deadpan and emotionless. James Bobin (Who made the fantastic 2011 Muppets Movie) could have done a much better job with the actors. The movie needed more flare in emotion instead of focusing on solely and only on it's message. If you don't know whether or not you should see Alice Through The Looking Glass, I suggest you wait for it to come to Netflix or Blu Ray. The movie can easily be skipped. But if you really want to see it, then go in knowing this is like a Sunday School Class only about time. It's a really good film in my opinion, but unfortunately, the movie is rather too preachy.89/100 B+",Alice Through the Looking Glass
92,autisticreviewers,Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,5,29 May 2016,"While director Tim Burton decided to give a dark and adventurous for the first Alice, this one is done completely differently. Director James Bobin (Director Of The Muppets movies) decides to give the sequel to Alice a go. While he ain't no Tim Burton, he certainly had a go.The CGI is still as bad as the first one, so it's no surprise to us that they kept everything the same. All the characters return, some get more screen time than others, which might be a disappointment to who you choose your favorite character to be. Mia Wasikowska seemed to be performing better here than she did in the first one. She's really good at playing this role. Johnny Depp was more in character this time than he was in the first one. Sacha Baron Cohen steals the show as playing the character ""Time."" His German accent went well with the character.While there were many scenes in the movie that were good and were entertaining. We just couldn't get into it. The movie was too slow and all the characters once again are all unlikable. Even Anne Hathaway (playing Mirana) and Helena Bonham Carter (Playing The Queen Of Hearts) are completely over exaggerated.It's not a horrible movie, but we would never pay to see it again. Only see it if you really must. Autistic Reviewers gave this 2/5 stars. 5/10.",Alice Through the Looking Glass
93,danielharden,Time to just stop,2,2 June 2016,"Alice Through the Looking Glass is the sequel to Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland that nobody asked for, but yet here it is. We return to the ugly world full of annoying caricatures for a second and hopefully final time (for the sake of my sanity).The ensemble cast fail miserably. Mia Wasikowska's enthusiasm is so false and patronising its as if shes talking to an infant child the whole way through the film. Sacha Baron Cohen and Johnny Depp both suffer from stupid voice syndrome as they both speak with a lisp and an accent that only they know what they were going for there. Helena Bonham Carter reprises her roll as the big headed (pun intended) Queen of Hearts, sulking her irritating little way through this 2 hour cluster f*ck. Its hard to care about these characters when you are simply struggling to tolerate them in the first place.The script is garbage. It's littered with unfunny jokes, puns that are so bad they aren't even funny and convenient exposition like ""Oh no only the return of the cronosphere can save us now."" Long story short its lazy and hard to believe someone was paid to write this piece of sh*t. I do wonder if the dialogue in the script includes the stupid lisps and accents because if so that just makes things worse.The narrative is heavily flawed from the start of this 2 hour slow motion car wreck. We spend the first 5 minutes hearing Alice go on about nothing being impossible only for her to go against everything she believes in another 5 minutes later. The whole series of events that take place in this film could have been avoided if Alice had just stood up for what she believed in and wasn't so fast to give up on her beliefs. But the illogical narrative points don't stop there, no sir. When the Queen of hearts takes her sister Mirana to a pretty petty moment in their childhood, what is her plan? To bust in the door, point and shout ""LIAR"" like a bitchy school girl and in doing so almost ending the world and all of time. Also its kinda pathetic that the explanation of why the Queen of Hearts is such an ass hole is because one day her sister ate the last tart and blamed her for it. Seriously? It's not even an excuse, some people are just born ass holes and the Queen of Hearts is one of them.BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE, the ending of the film is literally bull*t saves the day as they straight up lost. Everything was consumed by some brown rust like substance and Alice did not return the cronosphere in enough time to restore time back to normality... Roll credits? Nope, have no fear the magical synapse of time will suddenly make a connection to the cronosphere and time is saved hooray for bs. Also if Alice literally let go of the cronosphere before turning to rust then the balance of time would have been restored, so yeah the ending is beyond stupid.I could go on about the many other aspects of this film that are terrible like the not so great sfx that the film chooses to focus on a lot or how the sfx create an ugly world to look at and yet for some reason the film persists with lingering on it, but I think I've made my point abundantly clear. This is not a good movie plain and simple, about the only thing that's good about this is hearing Alan Rickman's voice and seeing Andrew Scott both of which last for like 2 minutes. Stop trying to make Tim Burton Alice films happen they aren't going to happen, and I hope now that this film has flopped in typical Johnny Depp fashion, most likely due to his wife beating allegations, that this is the last we shall see of Annoying Alice and the ugly Underlandians.",Alice Through the Looking Glass
94,samyoung-82648,Great potential,3,11 November 2016,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first film. This one was a major let down. The first 10 minutes of the movie are some extreme sexist propaganda. Men are all bad, women are beyond redemption. It was laid on thick and fast. Also, Alice came across as extremely arrogant. If I knew anyone as arrogant as Alice is played, i'd have some impolite words for them.On top of that, the story dragged. I liked Alice (Mia) after the first 10 minutes. Time (Baron Cohen) was unusually lame. Johnny Depp was not himself either. Even the Red Queen (Bonham Carter) wasn't her usual excellent self.If you've got a quiet night, consider hiring this one. However, it's not a keeper. Some other reviewers said that the audience were dimwits and didn't get the time references or from the book. However, some people aren't sexist, nor do they like gender politics rammed down their throat repeatedly. If you don't like gender politics, give this one a miss.",Alice Through the Looking Glass

Even movie is well done and looks beautiful this kind of fairy tale won't assure me. Not even Johnny Depp as Mad Hatter's role don't manage. Maybe I am not a target audience of this movie. First movie Alice In Wonderland was actually quite average movie, but this sequel is even worst. Over acted and childish story is just not for my taste. Hollywood movie makers should take these sequels more seriously. Just to make almost identically sequel with first movie won't be enough of price of the movie ticket. There is some try to add some time travelling for story. That may sometimes be quite entertaining, but not in here. Alice In wonderland was quite average movie, but this is not even that. This should be direct to DVD movie, because this is not worth of a movie ticket. Wait until you get it from Netflix. I think it won't take for a long time to happen.",Alice Through the Looking Glass

According to the plot, this one should be called ""Crazy Hat Biography"", close to the first story line, the grievances between the red and white queens, indicating that there is no love and hate in this world for no reason, and there is no absolute justice and evil. Everything must have cause and effect. No one can change history, but you can learn something from it and do something impossible. A very good film, not only the characters are very funny, fantasy wonderland inside is also very fantasy. Taking the little story of the White Queen as a child and the Red Queen as a child, it taught us to do something wrong with people who are sorry for important things, as long as the attitude is sincere, apologize and ask for forgiveness from the other party, we can reconcile and cherish the time.

99,goolizap,Twizard Rating: 97,10,6 June 2016,"Despite what many may think about this film, I loved it. It's far better than its more meandering predecessor--which wasn't terrible, either.No longer in the auteuristic grasp of Tim Burton, but just within reach, is a movie which isn't so concerned about contriving a certain tone that it loses what makes it organically appealing. This one is way more fun because we're actually on an adventure, rather than simply sitting through a series of disjointed events. Here, things actually happen.Alice is summoned back to Underland because the Mad Hatter is dying. He is losing the will to live. He believes his family is still alive, yet everyone is telling him that they've died. After holding on a little longer for Alice to come to his rescue, she also admits that she also believes him to be wrong. The White Queen convinces Alice that there is one way to bring his family back--to go back in time.Aside from a few minor time travel plot holes, the only big problem, if any, is the abundance underutilized characters. We literally get nothing from the Cheshire Cat, the White Rabbit, Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumb, among others. They are there so we can say they are. But besides the occasional lark, they serve almost no purpose.We are, however, introduced to a new character, Time, played by Sacha Baron Cohen. He's the gatekeeper of the past, present, and future, and possesses a device that Alice must steal so she can go back in time. With a Schwarzeneggering accent, Cohen provides us with most of the levity throughout the film. He's not over-the-top and he doesn't overstay his welcome.Helena Bonham Carter nearly eclipses her performance from the first movie, convincing as the heartless, yet insecure tyrant, even long before revealing further depth in her character.With dialogue much more fit for following along, Alice Through the Looking Glass is easier to understand than the first film--which is odd since this is the one that features the main protagonist traveling every which way throughout the time circuits. Usually a film with this much time travel would get confusing, but the filmmakers avoid ever making it convoluted.Even though everything in this movie looks amazingly attractive to the eye, every beat is necessary. Every beat feels necessary. Every time travel. Every place Alice goes and does. There aren't any filler scenes.To truly appreciate this film, you must first appreciate the relationship between Alice and the Mad Hatter carried over from the first movie--otherwise you may not care all that much.There is a great vision for this film, and an even better execution. I loved it. Don't let the reviews fool you--it's enjoyable. One of my favorites of this year.Twizard Rating: 97",Alice Through the Looking Glass
100,Dannyboi94,"Dull, uninteresting and unimaginative",3,15 June 2016,"The first Alice in Wonderland directed by Tim Burton was an interesting movie, filled with creative art and imaginative creatures and designs, while it lacked story, it was an entertainment, this movie, was not.The movie begins on a high note, with a visually spectacular scene, it was shot and filmed very well, but then moves onto a film that tries to be creative, but falls short due to a lacking of a compelling story. The premise of the movie was interesting, and could have made a very good film, but we are given an over the top mess, with god awful CGI in parts, and some of the worst green-screen effects I have ever seen.The acting in this movie is not bad however, with each performance being either good or mediocre. I was looking forwards to seeing Johnny Depp, as his performance in the first one was very good, here, it was a let down. His make-up is very bizarre, and he does seem like he is investing in the role. Aside from the first scene, there are no memorable moments in this film, and with the dreadful and boring plot-line, the film does not carry itself. It is not a 'bad' film, as there are few moments of laughter here and there, but at the end of the film I felt like it was unnecessary. I feel that if Tim Burton had donned the directorial position again, this film would have been slightly better. 3.3/10",Alice Through the Looking Glass
101,tiskec,Not Too bad.,5,23 March 2021,"I would say that the first release of Tim Burton's Alice In Wonderland was far better. I got the vibe that this sequel was more concentrated on visual effects rather than the storyline.To me the acting in this film (although not bad) was more ""flat"" than that of the original. When Alice returned to Wonderland, the reactions from it's inhabitants kind of gave me a fake feeling of ""oh my God! It's Alice."" There's just not a lot of emotion in the acting when you compare the movie to the original.The visual effects of the film are stunningly gorgeous. It's kind of a debate to me whether I'd let very young youth view it, due to some fantasy violent storytelling visuals, but it is a family film nonetheless. I would probably say ages 9+ in my opinion. This is just my opinion.Overall, the movie is decent and I rated it while comparing it to the original at a mid level. If you liked the first film, it's definitely worth a watch. 5/10",Alice Through the Looking Glass

And holy cow did this movie have great 3D effects. A lot of times i feel like the 3D is a cash-grab, but this movie is very well made technically with some great FX.Definitely worth seeing in the theatre.",Alice Through the Looking Glass
103,The_Celluloid_Sage,Ugggh....Burton..just stop now...,5,6 April 2020,"I have never been the biggest fan of the first film by Tim Burton (as a lover of the books and original animated film) and was not exactly looking forward to what in my opinion was a pointless and unneeded sequel to an equally pointless first film. Hollywood at the moment seems intent in remaking, rebooting, making prequels and sequels of everything it can from old classics (and not so old classics) to foreign films. I'm personally growing tired of it. Whether they think it's needed for a modern younger audience, or there really is a serious lack of writing talent around I'm not sure.Mia Wasikowski returns (after her moderately successful role in Crimson Peak) as Alice and I still feel that she is miscast. Mia to my mind is a very classical actress and suits more period drama type stuff. I think that is where she was cast perfectly in Del Torro's Crimson Peak (Review to come at some point) as that had the style, atmosphere and more importantly the period setting where she shines. Here unfortunately she does not. But then she is not alone in that regard.We find Alice as a ships captain returning home only to find out that her mother is set to sell away everything they have, including her fathers beloved ship in order to stave of financial ruin. Before much longer Alice is following a butterfly and finds herself back in Wonderland where she meets the old gang again (Nice to hear Rickman's voice once again) only to be told the Hatter is dying and that his family may well still be alive. Alice sets out to find them in order to save her old friend.The main problem this film suffers from though is that it is all a little badly paced and a little messy. Bobin to his credit has managed to create a film with a similar look and style to Burton's epic mess (if that indeed actually deserves any credit), but this isn't really any better. The effects and CGI come thick and fast to try and paper the cracks of a muddled story, over-acting and a very weak script. Even the score is mostly recycled, and really Danny Elfman can do so much better when he puts his mind to it. At least production values are good though, but then with the budget this feature had, they sure as hell better be.I personally feel that Depp is long past his best and has not made a good film in close to fifteen years. He lisps his way through his parts and at times looks lost, as if he is wondering exactly what he is doing there. Meanwhile Helena Bonham Carter is just annoying and screeches, screams and over-acts her way through her scenes in an attempt to cover up how bad she is of late. The rest of the cast are acceptable (including Sacha Baron Cohen) but everything is average with no real stand out performances.A visually very impressive film it is sure to please the younger children but while looking impressive, it cannot hide the truly shocking sections of CGI interlaced within the visuals. The trio really do not have the magic anymore, and without Burton, Depp and Carter are average at best now. Such a shame that a once great actor now churns out more turkeys than swans. Stick it on for the kids during the holidays, but don't expect much if you're looking for a quality telling of the book.The Sage's Rating: 5/10",Alice Through the Looking Glass

105,ragpap93,I really wanted to hate this movie but it is OK at least some of it is,5,28 March 2017,This is the only Alice through the looking glass movie and it is more like an adaptation of the book than an accurate plot that perfectly follows the incidents in it. So naturally I wanted to hate it. Straightaway in the first scene Alice is the captain of a ship and everything in this scene was nonsense. Okay she can be a captain but what did they actually do? Discover a tiny island or race the pirates to it? This has no real tie-in with the story except that Alice loves to be captain of a vessel. It gets a little worse before it gets better. She gets back to England and finds out her father is dead and her mother Helen is signing away the ship to save the house due to some mortgage and or Alice has always lived the way she wanted to and that is not a way for a nineteenth century woman to live. They should live in oppression and must get used to it like Helen has. So Alice must leave the career she apparently was so good at because it is a man's job not a woman's job. At this point I actually hated Helen more than that villainous guy who was behind all this as a revenge for being rejected by Alice when he proposed to her. At least he had a spine and there was a more valid reason for his behavior than woman's etiquette. Alice then follows Absolem voiced by the late Alan Rickman into a looking glass.The madhatter was a moody moping mess and this was worse than the previous movie but it is his family who apparently died and he believes that they are still alive. His sadness is causing him to die and we enter the dramatic Bollywood till the nineties since Bollywood is less cheesy nowadays than Hollywood. Alice not believing in the hatter goes to see Time so she could go back in him LOL and save the hatter's family. Time was done well by the Borat star. Trust me the middle section of the movie was genuinely good and Lewis Carrol funny. The ending was better than the beginning but only by a margin. Where Helen states the ever so obvious 'you are a bad man' at the villain and instead of selling the house gives a shot at feminism.It ends with both mother and daughter getting into a ship for a voyage into the unknown and I wished them Mal Voyage and hoped that they would go down with their ship and so could never attempt a sequel to an already horrible movie. In conclusion it is a movie done so bad that it is kinda good and you would get some entertainment from it unlike its previous.,Alice Through the Looking Glass
106,arturmachado-29588,What are great visuals without context or a good plot?,3,16 August 2017,"Without Tim Burton as director, and you did very well, Tim, to stay away. Sequel to the 2010 movie ""Alice in Wonderland"", this one soon starts with sexist feminist propaganda, with Alice a few years older as, just imagine, captain of a merchant ship. The innocent Alice of the first movie here is an arrogant pirate to her subordinates, she responds crookedly to her mother and steals an artifact that allows her to travel in time even though she has been warned and experienced firsthand that the past is unalterable, and she does it to help the Hatter who is dying of, just imagine, nostalgia for his 'supposedly' dead family. Then in the end all turns out well with impossible understandings: the two queens would never be friends forever and ever even being sisters, for one is notoriously insane, just as Alice's mother's change of heart is totally out of character. Moreover, the story is bad, confusing, and stumbles upon itself like the hands of a clock in infinite circles (and that is what it is about!), the visual aspect being the only redeeming factor. But what are great visuals without context or a good plot? The answer to that question is this movie.",Alice Through the Looking Glass
107,seveb-25179,Not enough Wonder,5,22 January 2018,"I enjoyed the first film, I thought it struck a good balance between the whimsical eccentricity of the source material and the modern Hollywood demand for thrill ride action.
But the second time around they get it all wrong, much as they did on the second Pirates of the Caribbean. Too much rushing around and too little humour and quirkiness.
Firstly, right from the get go, they forget to maintain the vital distinction between the Fantasy World of Wonderland, where the impossible is common place, and the Real World, where the possible needs to remain within the constraints of the culture and available technology of the day, in order to be credible.
So we get Alice, the teenage female Captain, sailing her Victorian sail powered merchant ship in ways that defy the laws of Real World physics (Groan)
Who needs to visit Wonderland if we can bend the Real World to our will in this way?
Secondly I think the decision to try and explain the backstory and motivation of the previous film's characters and situations was misguided.
We don't need to know this, and it goes against the whole idea of ""Wonderland"", once things are explained, they often lose much of their ""Magic"", their wonder.
The Queen of Hearts happens to be a bitch and she serves a purpose in the story, that is her only ""why"", we aren't supposed to understand or feel sorry for her.
The fun of Wonderland is in the novelty of the experience and trying to explain it only dilutes or destroys that.
Thirdly they don't introduce enough new characters or situations with the requisite quirkiness, the original is a parade of quirky characters, this one only has a few, with the space between filled up with, briefly, revisiting old ones and, mainly, by pointless rushing about.
I enjoyed Sacha Baron-Cohen's ""Time"", but his assistants were merely derivative of other movies tiny mechanical robots, and there was very little else we hadn't already seen in the first movie.
Too whoever wrote the script for this one I say ""Off with their heads!""",Alice Through the Looking Glass

109,trevor-82944,Off with the Director's Head!,3,22 June 2016,"I remember being six years old and going mad as a hatter with my VHS copy of Walt Disney's 1951 Alice in Wonderland. The pretty colors and zany characters made me want to step into a world of my own like Alice did, which later triggered my obsession with other fantasies such as Harry Potter and Pokémon. Maybe it was the lack of rules and logic that appealed to my peculiar mind of the time, but to this day, Disney's take on Carroll's creation perfectly reflects what goes on in my head.But Alice Through the Looking Glass directly insults Carroll's imagination—again. Why's that? I'll start at the beginning. And when I get to the end, I'll stop.I already hated Tim Burton's take on Alice in Wonderland. It was tonally unfaithful to Lewis Carroll's classic novel, was filled with plot holes deeper than any rabbit hole, and the imagination beyond the art direction was nowhere to be seen. I simply hated every second of that mess of a movie. The rest of the critics pleaded Burton to not make a sequel, but in spite of this very good advice, he did not follow it.Burton is not directing this continuation of his vision. Rather, The Muppets director James Bobin has that burden. He has stated in the past how he wanted to bring out the Victorian era also satirized by Lewis Carroll, particularly the suffragette movement. Therefore, he combined the twisted material with his comedic background in order to portray a woman who has a choice and a voice in society. ​ It does start off a bit promising in the film's first few moments, as Alice has now become a ship captain in memory of her father, and spent the previous three years traveling the world. She refuses to believe in the word ""impossible,"" which shows through her decisions on the job. This would be an excellent role model for girls to follow, if actress Mia Wasikowska cared about the role she was playing. Throughout the entire film, she never reacts to anything, including the death of a coworker, beyond raising her voice a little. It gets honestly annoying most of the time how disinterested she is, even more so than the first movie.Okay, so her acting as the title role halts any positive impression on the girls watching, but it's not the only thing at fault. Take a look at everything else, as in, all the CGI that overpowers the screen in every single frame. Bobin does try to give a different energy from the first film by exploring different parts of Wonderland, and at first, he's somewhat successful at it. When Alice first steps through the mirror into Wonderland, the room she enters is enormous, complete with a yawning tiger rug and talking chess pieces. Next thing she knows, she's falling through birds in square flight patterns into the gathering of all her friends. It all progressively gets curiouser and curiouser as she's taken by her friends into the castle where Time lives, in order to venture back several years and rescue the Mad Hatter's parents from the Jabberwocky. This castle looks huge, with the sounds of cranking cogs leading into the castle's entrance. From here, there's an incredible sea of time and a kingdom of red vines overrun by glowing blue centipedes. These 3D extravaganza elements are both the film's greatest asset and greatest flaw.It's not only that the CGI looks more like video game graphics than an actual world, but more like no exploration goes into this already uninteresting reality of uninteresting characters. There's zero emotion, zero time to look into anything, and zero captivating substance.Plus, so what if the Mad Hatter's may never see his family again? So what if it's up to Alice to rescue them for the sake of Wonderland? I was never given a reason to care, and neither was Alice. I guess that's what you get when you resort to coincidences in order to move along an overused plot. It would be so nice for these stories to make sense for a change.Lewis Carroll's treasured classics have been around for a long time now, and time has inspired thousands of readers to come up with their own interpretations to this new reality. To me, Wonderland is about the autistic mind. To Walt Disney, Wonderland is about a girl seeing all these beautiful colors with unforgettable figures. To Tim Burton, Wonderland needed a makeover in order to become a modern, epic, twisted fantasy for a new generation. Now, his vision gets expanded on to put in another artist's take on Wonderland. While there's no problem with doing so, any credibility or reasoning behind this adaptation has lost its way, leaving behind a lack of respect to its source material. It's not about the message like the director claims, it's about the pretty visuals I wouldn't mind showing up late to see. But even so, I encourage you to give the original books a read, it just might inspire you to make a book, movie, poem, costume, or art piece someday that feels more real than this impossibly mad mess. ​ Overall Grade: D",Alice Through the Looking Glass

Alice Through the Looking Glass takes place a few years after the first movie after Alice has finished her voyage around the world. When she returns, an old friend from Underland leads Alice through a mirror which leads her back to Underland. She learns that her best friend, the Mad Hatter, has lost his ""muchness."" The Hatter found the first hat he ever made where his family was killed by the Jabberwocky, and he thinks that his family is still alive, but no one believes him, including Alice. The White Queen devises a plan for Alice to steal a device called the Chronosphere which will allow her to travel back in time and save the Hatter's family. All the characters come back from the first movie, although a lot of them are in smaller roles, but the real standout is newcomer Sacha Baron Cohen as Time. He and Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen were surprisingly funny throughout the film and made for some memorable villains. Mia Wasikowska also had a reliably good performance as Alice. Through the Looking Glass doesn't have the thorough world-building that Alice in Wonderland had, but the plot is easier to follow in this one. Along with some breathtaking visuals, Alice Through the Looking Glass should please fans of first film with a fun and exciting return to Underland.",Alice Through the Looking Glass

Thus, I rented the second one and they loved it even more sat through the whole movie. I MYSELF felt it was better than the first more going on and less stand still moments. As to the complants of the hater being annoying and etc well directors change characters and he was not suppose to be the same at all I found him better as to there was not as much rhyming and even less talking. The white queen well she was dull to Begin with and red queen annoying as well before. We loved the new little clocks workers as well. Most people also forget there are many versions of the films that was adapted from the books.

113,Kingkitsch,"Time isn't a thief, but the director of this movie is",1,18 October 2016,"This bloated mess of a ""sequel"" to Tim Burton's ""Alice in Wonderland"" is a turgid psychedelic mess. Keeping only the title to Lewis Carrolls's second eponymous novel about Alice attempting to keep her sanity in a world inhabited by clearly insane individuals, ""Looking Glass"" has little to offer other than a paper-thin plot penned by hack writer Linda Woolverton. Woolverton invented the ""Underland"" idea that ruined the first Burton film, but that piece of dreck made at least a billion dollars, so hey! let's get Linda back for more stupidity. Two hours drag by while the audience is beaten over the head with layer after layer of CGI visuals. Once this tedium is over, you can't really point at much of anything that rose above any other set pieces. The theft of ideas on display here is the most memorable thing to viewers who can catch some of the many grabs from other, better sources. Time's castle is simply one of many video games, take your pick. The ""seconds"" who work for Time are metal Minions. The visual in which the ""hours' stop the Great Clock is a mashup of Transformers + Fritz Lang's epic ""Metropolis"". The Chronosphere is another version of ""The Time Machine"", looking like the mechanism from the 2002 version of Well's tale. Floating clocks and gears are borrowed from Scorsese's ""Hugo"". There's more than a little ""Back to the Future"" going on here as well.The most interesting visuals come from the Queen of Heart's vegetable servants, which were ripped out of the pages of art history for a couple of cheap jokes, these creatures were invented by the painter Arcimboldo, who died in 1593!! He got no screen credit as far as I could tell. Other bits and pieces in this gaudy bore were snatched as well, no sense in pointing them out. It's no wonder some viewers kept thinking ""I've seen this before"". That's because you have.Depp needs to put down the makeup and stop lisping. Helena Bonham Carter just bellows. Sasha Baron Cohen was nearly impossible to understand. The reworking of the Wonderland characters into some weird Tolkien-like Middle Earth inhabitants isn't worth talking about. In terms of crime, this movie is grand larceny. Thank goodness Lewis Carroll only wrote the two Alice books, but I'm sure Linda Hackwriter would be willing to pen yet another bad trip for a big check.

114,slicedbread117,An Uninspired Cash-Grab,4,29 June 2016,"There's a strong difference between when a sequel is released for the fans, with an interesting story to explore, and when one is released for the box office success. Alice Through the Looking Glass (ATLG), unfortunately, suffers from being part of the later, giving the demeaning feeling that the film wasn't given the proper treatment it needed to be a sequel worthy of even existing in the first place.2010's Alice In Wonderland was a new take on the age-old story of Alice and her mystical fantasy world, and while not a masterpiece by any stretch, was a fairly well pieced together and entertaining film. 6 years later, we're back in Wonderland, and for the vast majority of the film, I was left pondering why we're back in Wonderland at all. ATLG is devoid of a meaningful story, devoid of any consistent pacing, and devoid of any originality, not even borrowing from the plot of the original novel.I will give the film one break, in that it is mostly geared towards a younger audience, but there have been numerous kids films that have delivered award-level scripts (Toy Story, The Incredibles, Lion King, etc.), so I can't cut the film too much slack. As a kids movie or not, if a film's story in engaging and interesting, I will be engaged and interested as well, but writer Linda Woolverton and the vision of director James Bobin leave the film feeling hopelessly uninspired, and at some points, completely boring.Like the first film, ATLG uses a mix between CG and live-action characters, and here it's pretty rough around the edges. The interaction between the two types of characters isn't all too believable, and often quite wonky. I would have preferred the entire film to have been animated. The overall use of CGI in the movie, like the first one, is overused almost to the point of garnering a headache. On a positive, the atmosphere presented is mostly wonderful. It's colorful and very detailed, but if you're film is going to have heavy doses of visual effects to supplement live- action actors, it needs to be tight and believable, and here, it's not so much.For the cast, we have the return of Mia Wasikowska in the lead role, and like her first crack as Alice, it is underwhelming and unimaginative. Wasikowska again doesn't seem to grasp the fictional world she's enveloped in, and in a setting like Wonderland, you want your lead to project the sense that she's in a fantasy world to your audience, something that Wasikowska still has yet to achieve. Superstar Johnny Depp reprises his role as the Mad Hatter, and unlike his original performance of the character, seems to not be enjoying himself as much this time around. And since it didn't seem as if he was having fun playing the character, I didn't have fun watching him. There were a couple solid performances, Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter as the antagonists Time and the Red Queen respectively. They're both enjoyable and often humorous, and are the two standouts in an otherwise very poor cast.There's some enjoyable humor and the rare scene that gets you excited in the slightest, but not nearly enough to build up a memorable film. The narrative structure doesn't give you any reason to care, there's not enough passion from most of the cast to deliver heartfelt moments, and while the film has bits and pieces of exciting visuals, the over-saturation of CGI is a heavy weight dragging the film down from being a truly enticing fantasy film. The idea to green-light this sequel was a mistake from the beginning, and it's clear that Alice Through the Looking Glass is nothing more than an excuse to make parents dig deep into their wallets for their kids, and make them witness the final nail in the coffin of this doomed franchise.4/10",Alice Through the Looking Glass
115,CinePendejo,Not committed in the slightest and ultimately pointless,3,31 May 2016,"Look I understand that people in my age and social background like movies like this. The first one in particular, being so drenched in Hot Topic merchandise, won us over no matter how flawed it was. However, with this movie, it just sucks. I'm sorry, but it's bad. In fact, this is the movie that drives home the insight that these people simply do not get Alice in Wonderland. It is the type of bad sequels that squanders every speck of potential on theprevious movie. The script is awful, the acting ranges to bland to embarrassing, the direction feels lifeless, the story barely compares the originals big scope as much as it compares to Reddit fan fiction, and theiconographies from the original book remains as sparse and extraneous as the first time around. Out of all the bad sequels to movies, this looks to be by far the worst, simply by the virtue of people behind it not caring what they are required to work with.The level of terrible this movie possesses doesn't even prompt me to even pay mind about the plot, but it's more interesting to realize how the screenwriter is about as careless as I am. The movie literally starts with Alice living her carefree, adventurous life as a naval voyager only to have it all stripped away by her ex-fiancé from the last movie for a contrived reason to have her back to square one (because sure, that's how good sequels usually work!). After about 15 minutes of almost insightful commentary about sexist social life in early England, Alice then journeys to Wonderland (yes they used to call it Underland, but I pay little to that detail almost as much as this movie does) and discovers that the Mad Hatter is suffering PTSD from his parents' death. Grief-stricken, Alice is informed that she must consult the matter to Time, a being with the ability to both manipulate every hour and spew out really obnoxious time puns. Having realized that he and the Queen of Hearts are conspiring against her, Alice takes matters in her own hands and steals the Chronosphere, a device-turned-time-traveling- hamster-wheel to save The Hatters illness. Oh, and the Cheshire cat is in this to!Anyway, if you thought any of the plot points I listed would instantly make a great movie, stay away from this movie. Every story element, like all of the classic Alice characters the movie throws in indiscriminately, is half- realized and with no worth whatsoever. The real life scenarios, where Alice struggles against the aforementioned sexism in the working class, are all abruptly resolved with no hesitation or engagement, with not even an attempt to satisfy with fantasy world, a concept that at least the first movie got right. Whereas the first movie adjoins the two worlds via a theme of finding the confidence to be different, this movie fumbles this completely, having the main lead shift from ""I will not stand for this oppression"" to ""nah, it will pass. You can have all I have.""But it's more than just the final message; for a tired attempt to flesh out the Hatters and the Queens backstories' via an over complicated time- traveling concept, the movie lacks the subtlety and nuance to have us invested in any of it. Not only does the movie takes the lazy routes of backstories, the whole staging and execution invokes no subtlety and winds up being tedious, and that is to say nothing of the film frequently detouring to the side characters fooling around. I have never experienced a 3rd grade level script in the short time I spent watching movies in my entire life.Had this been the first film, the weak script would be levied by some visuals, much credit to Tim Burton. But this movie is stuck with James Bobin, late of two The Muppet movie. The attempt to fill in Burton's seat cripples Bobin to replicate his vision, rendering the whole production severely downgraded. Whereas the Muppets all he does is photographs real puppets, he fails with set piece spectacles and overuse of CG and green screen, thus making them look bafflingly poor. And no matter how much CG and over-the-top costumes and make-up piles up on frame, he just makes the time- traveling sequences look boring, the empty story look emptier, and the painfully predictable climax look uninteresting. The first movie may be little more than just style over substance, but at least the style came from a particular vision, and seeing someone trying to ape the same aesthetic is perplexing.The acting is all flavors of bad. Poor Mia Wasikowska proving her abilities in other movies, but here shes is out of her range. Helena Bonham Carter and Johnny Depp both top this year's bad performance. What was once acceptable quirkiness from the first film now proves to be obnoxious once the film attempts to make them well-rounded characters. Only Borat, who plays Time, seems to be consistently fun in his role. Yes, it's clear that he's just marketing bait for the film, but he hams it up just enough so we won't get sick of him.I could go on bashing this movie (like saying how bad the jokes are and how the Queen got her head so big is beyond stupid even by Lewis Carroll standards) but I would just be rambling. Bottom line, this movie is an absolute waste of potential, notwithstanding my low expectations. Don't see it.For my complete review, check out my blog! http://itachisan125.blogspot.com/",Alice Through the Looking Glass
116,Pramitheus,A sequel well wasted,3,13 January 2017,"I absolutely loved the 1st Alice, which was directed by Tim Burton himself. It brought a feeling of awe and madness and that was very much lacking in this sequel. Well, calling it a sequel isn't correct because it has absolutely no connection to the 1st one. The characters are there but the story has no motivation. The only thing that really made me happy was listening to Alan Rickman's voice, one more time.STORY - Alice has been gone from the Underland as well as from the real land for a long, long time. Things have changed. In the real world, Alice's ex-fiancé has taken over her business and when she comes to know that she is about to lose her medium for adventure, Underland calls her for help. Hatter is distraught and is dying out of grief and Alice must help him. In order to help him, Alice goes to Time himself in order to fix the past and thus mend the present. This could have been an interesting story but the screenplay starts to fall apart after 45 minutes of screen-time. There is no real character motivation and everything seems to fall in the correct place with no real explanation. Like how did Iracebeth meet Time? How did she even return because as far as I remember, she was sent to exile. It was so convenient when Alice falls into the wrong timeline and finds out about the exact things she has to fix. I know it's a kid's story but there was no fun in it. Everyone was so weepy and emotional and that brings me to the director.DIRECTION - So, this one is not directed by Tim Burton. It is directed by James Bobin who has directed the Muppet movies and Ali G. Now that explains a lot. I just don't understand that why doesn't a director return for the sequel? I mean, you started it. Just see it through! James Bobin just sucked out the fun. I know the original was cheesy and over-the-top but it was fun. A bit exposition heavy but it added to the character of the Underland. This movie just expected us to assume where something is taking place. Last night I was watching a video about the flaws in BvS and there the Youtuber mentioned that BvS didn't have a sense of place. Gotham and Metropolis look the same. The characters are kept in close-up so you don't feel the place they are in and that detaches the audience from feeling anything real. The case here is almost similar. The 1st movie always introduced the place where the characters were entering, due to which I'd know that where the characters are. Here it was just jump, jump and jump. I don't want to include a separate section for CGI and editing so I am including it here. The editing wasn't snappy enough. If you'd remember the tea- party scene in the 1st movie, you'd notice that it was very quick and that made that scene more humorous. Here, they missed a lot of beats and it wasn't only limited to the tea-party scene but the whole movie. The CGI felt extremely off at times. The lighting was wrong in the opening scene as well as when Alice meets Hatter for the 2nd time.ACTING - The acting was very bland. They were doing the same thing that they did in the original. Johnny Depp felt a bit off but I won't blame him. The worst of the lot was Sacha Baron Cohen, who was actually doing a Borat impression the whole time. Again, won't blame him.FINAL VERDICT - I hate it when sequels just bank on the success of the 1st one and doesn't improve on it. What is the rush? Make a proper script, take your time and give us a good movie. If you've haven't seen this one, don't. Just re-watch the original. This one is certainly not worth your TIME.",Alice Through the Looking Glass

I believe people gave this film 1/10 or 2/10 out of frustration, which I do understand. But that is definitely not the mark for the value of this movie.This movie reminded me of Delicatessen and alike productions. Of course, not the same subject, but definitely the same result as a work of art.I believe it has a chance to make it to the lists of recommended movies, a few years from now on.With this is mind, this film is somehow flawed. The actor's play is rather lifeless, when it's not simply non existent. Seems like the director thought I'll let the make up speak instead. The 'Time' is perhaps the best character, while Johnny Depp although as impressive in it's mimics, seems more distant than ever behind his character mask. Sad, the director could not inject a small dose of adrenaline in it's characters.But the most striking flaw in the movie is the lack of 'substance' in the set up. While the set up is a work of art, it does lack something. It looks somehow like a mosaic were several pieces didn't match well.Despite many reviews commenting on the lack of plot or story line, I do find it very acceptable, but then I have not read the book or seen the first movie, so my perception has a good chance to be free of bias.Not perfect, looks somehow un-achieved, the plot won't ask for an Oscar, but if you go see it without preset standards, you will definitely be surprised in a way we don't get often times.

The issue with these films is that they are not based on story content by Lewis Carroll. They merely take his titles and produce an entirely new story. So basically, why does this new movie exist? MONEY! So the screenwriters made up another new story based in the universe created by Lewis Carroll... How can somebody all these years later extend and tamper with stories that are all time classics. But who knows, maybe by some miracle the extended story lies on par with the imagination and creativity of the legend Lewis Carroll... It doesn't. The story is dumb and boring but it tries incredibly hard to be great. It's the type of story which relies on characters to make dumb decisions in order to extend the runtime. Furthermore the characters are all ridiculously over acted, with the dialogue sounding so forced, in the attempt to match the writing by Lewis Carroll. Also the CGI is trash. It looks like rainbow vomit, but not realistic, more like animation. It also tries to give all the characters these emotional back stories, like the Red Queen and the Mad Hatter. To me I find it's disrespectful. Don't tamper with a classic. The only person who can add to theses characters is Lewis Carroll... So I pretty much hated this movie. It's garbage. Why does it exist?

I suspect that that might be the case because with the first one, the crux of the movie is the spectacle that is Burton's interpretation of Alice in Wonderland; we have to introduce all of the characters and tie them all together with an adventure. In Through the Looking Glass, we can just have an adventure.The performances were all perfectly good. In one review, someone said that Sasha Baron Cohen's performance of Time was just Cohen doing an impression of Werner Herzog. Herzog is the guy who made Grizzly Man. Sure, I can see that in terms of his accent but I don't think it's a minus point to the movie. I thought he was a solidly balanced character that I enjoyed watching.The big thing about this movie were the special effects. I thought there were fine too; not earth shattering nor dull.Maybe one of the reasons I didn't mind this movie was because my expectations were appropriately grounded. I was expecting it to be unwatchably bad. Another reason was that I had just finished watching Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory which I loathed, so Through the Looking Glass felt like a Burton-esque film that wasn't garbage. Overall, I'd recommend Alice Through the Looking Glass if you are looking for a light movie, maybe a weekend matinée.",Alice Through the Looking Glass
130,kevin_newdirections,It's like attending a fancy tea party wherein fact you are expecting for a heavy sumptuous lunch.,6,11 July 2016,"Alice (Mia Wasikowska), now a buccaneering ship captain, is summoned by Absolem (voiced by the late Alan Rickman, RIP Professor Snape) back to the whimsical world of Wonderland to cheer up the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) who is apparently dying from a broken heart since none of his friends believe that his presumably dead family might still be alive. With the Hatter being her ""truest friend"", Alice decides to agree with the White Queen's (Anne Hathaway) ""unpossible"" plan to go back in time to the day the Jabberwocky attacked to save Hatter's family from being killed. Doing this requires Alice to borrow (or steal if the former does not work) the Chronosphere, a gold orb that is in the possession of Time (Sacha Baron Cohen), the human clock of Wonderland. The said orb transforms into a vehicle that will allow Alice to traverse the oceans of time. Not heeding Time's warning that, ""You can't change your past, but you can only learn from it,"" Alice will soon realize that her rash actions impose danger to the existence of Wonderland.When a sequel uses time-travel as its gimmick, one can get the impression that a franchise may be starting to run out of ideas. What's disappointing is that given the wealth of possibilities in Caroll's work, screenwriter Linda Woolverton chooses an antiquated trick that is best left to Back to the Future. I may have only read plot summaries of Caroll's work but that is enough for me to learn that this film is just loosely based on its source material. The only same thing that both happened in the film and the novel is that Alice slips through the liquid surface of a looking glass. Furthermore, it is rather odd to name the film after an object that plays such a small role in the film. For example, Harry Potter films don't end up being titled with, ""Harry Potter through the Brick Wall."" See how odd it could be? Anyway, believe it or not, this sequel has more structure than the last one. Saving the Hatter's family is clearly the MacGuffin of the story, but what the script asks Alice to do is to be basically a tour guide to the origin stories of the White Queen, the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) and the Mad Hatter. It is more disappointing once you learn that the root of all evil involves a stolen strawberry tart to which the film comes up with a rushed resolution in favor of scenes that add little value to the story. I'm referring to that episode of Alice in the asylum that should be best left in the cutting floor.If there's anything to be excited for with this film it's that Alice Though the Looking Glass is filled to the brim with Wonderland characters both old and new, from the Cheshire Cat to Humpty Dumpy. Depp, as the Mad Hatter, ceased to be a human being in his films a long time ago, especially here because you barely recognize the actor due to the heavy make-up. And, I'm not exactly sure if that's a compliment. He can't seem to get away from this type of façade to the point that his acting becomes somewhat artificial and calculated. However, as the story forces the Hatter to be sad for most parts of the film, he actually becomes more bearable when subdued. Hathaway, with her matching jazzy fingers, puts on a delicate performance that she almost fades in the background and Bonham Carter's shrieking voice of insanity is a welcome repeat. Sacha Baron Cohen as Time, who happens to have an inscrutable thick German accent, is amusing. Despite being marketed as the villain of this sequel, he is actually more of the good guy here than Alice who is messing with the timelines. Alice, however, has a disappointing characterization. She proves to be an intelligent and a strong leader in the real world but when she gets back to Wonderland, she makes a lot of hasty decisions. Wasikowska is a wonderful actress but sometimes she acts too patronizing as if she's talking to an infant during the entire film.Much like its predecessor, this film has a lot of visual feasts to offer: lavish and intricate costumes, expensive production sets, dazzling cinematography, etc. However not even sensory overload and the script's occasional fancy wordplay can compensate for an underwhelming story. It attempts to flesh out some messages on loss and acceptance but my emotional engagement stays behind the glass for me to fully grasp it. Watching Alice Through the Looking Glass is like attending a fancy tea party wherein fact you are expecting for a heavy sumptuous lunch – it is far from being a terrible sequel, however, it is by no means a good Disney classic.Full review: http://www.filmpolicereviews.com/reviews/alice-looking-glass",Alice Through the Looking Glass
131,QueerVamp20,You Must Have An Imagination To Watch This.,7,26 July 2016,"I love Alice in Wonderland - In fact I love most fairy tale/fantasy movies. With the first Tim Burton Alice movie I wasn't disappointed, but the story took me by surprise. The same goes for this movie. But the surprise for me was that I really enjoyed this movie. I wasn't sure what to expect, so I went in not expecting much - and though the story line was a little bland - It was nice to see what became of Alice - Also in this movie, you learn things about people you didn't know. Such as the White and Red Queen's childhood. Take a step through the looking glass and follow Alice through an adventure to save The Mad Hatter's family - In a race to turn back time, Alice goes on another adventure and learns some things that cannot change the past, but can change the present.",Alice Through the Looking Glass
132,Venom_81,Mediocre story with great visual effects,6,13 December 2016,"Tim Burton refused to direct this movie..and there is a reason..simply the script is terrible. There is no real and solid story behind this movie if not a marketing operation. The direction works well, nothing special but nothing you can complain about, also the rhythm and the storytelling works good, the problem is the script. The movie is visually stunning , probably visual effects are the only reason to watch this movie. Jhonny Deep is probably on his worst interpretation, he isn't able to transmit anything not even the madness of his character. Mia Wasikovska is the only one who truly believe in the project and tries to produce a decent interpretation. Sacha Baron Coen is funny on his character but maybe he could add more personality in his interpretation. As I already said you can watch this movie just for the amazing visual effects..but without a decent story isn't so entertaining",Alice Through the Looking Glass

134,aegoss,"Very little to do with the book, but a visual treat",4,7 August 2018,"As the film begins the viewer might wonder if they are watching a Pirates of the Caribbean knockoff. They are not, instead it is Steampunk Onedin Line out of Poldark, with a hint of Dickens.
The plot is absurd, but no more so than The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (original radio version anyway), and contrives to be coherent within its own definition.
The CGI, other than the intro sequence, is magnificent, like Armageddon, forget the plot, enjoy the spectacle. Alas, the cast of Armageddon threw themselves into their roles with gusto, and offer some of the most glorious over acting imaginable. Here, nobody except the Cheshire Cat and Alice inhabits the role consistently. Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee bear an uncanny resemblance to Boris Johnson, but are no more convincing.
As another reviewer has pointed out, the psychology is absurd, but unlike the physics, is poorly thought out, and falls flat.
There are numerous references to both the Alice Through the Looking Glass and in Wonderland books, but as decoration only, the substance is pure Disney Family Values pap, with visual goings-on to keep the eyes on the screen.

135,zalouteacher,Going back to literature,8,16 September 2016,"I liked the fact that the script of the movie is full of puns and rhymes taken from the original work. This makes the movie as interesting as the original Through the Looking Glass since Lewiss Carroll was famous with riddles and hidden messages in his works and he was known to include mathematical wonders in the writing such as the case of Alice in Wonderland. Maybe the plot was not greasy enough but overall it was a nice movie. The character that I liked most is Hatter( Johnny Depp) who has again striken me with his ability to wear different hats of roles and to impersonate himself in the character he's given.

It's true that in the previous film some aspects from the book weren't included, but the opportunity of a surprising film was gone. Some messages at the movie are very good.

I was amazed to see so many negative reviews about a really good movie. My comment is about not believing comments on IMDb. There has been times when I've read positive reviews about a movie, and the move sucked major ass. Now I read negative reviews about a movie that was really good from beginning to end, and it simply amazes me. That's why I've decided to pay no attention to reviews too much and just watch the film and make my own decision on whether its good or not. There are just too many critics and you just can't rely on what you read. Don't get me wrong, some of the reviews are spot on and I find myself in total agreement with some reviews, but this movie was really awesome.

141,cesar_augusto,It's...not nearly a disaster as the first one.,5,21 April 2017,"OK, unlike the previous movie, this time we knew what we were going into, so I had my expectations on low. One thing for sure, Mia's acting improved, she now can make real emotions! who knew? Visually, it is also very good, I really enjoyed the visuals, scenario, costumes, it was really nice-looking and compared to the last movie, packed more vibrant colors. I personally had a very low expectation about Time. When I saw it was Sasha Baron Cohen in a seemingly antagonist role in the trailers, I expected him to just chew the scenery and be annoying, but he was actually one of my favorite characters, maybe because his acting wasn't forced and his role was more than antagonic, more neutral. But speaking of which, he was also the following elephant in the room that was the plot holes in this movie. The plot itself felt like Alice Madness Returns from Spicy Horse. Not enough plot, too much action and visuals, complete with clockwork robots that would feel right at home as a video game boss. But the writing wasn't that bad, some lines were really clever and had a nice ring to the ears. Now, irredeemably, the pop song in the credits was just plain stupid. Seriously Disney? A pop song in a Alice in Wonderland movie? Final thoughts: The movie was definitely clumsy and not enough plot compared to the overbalancing visuals. The acting improved, and just like the previous movie, The plot was simply a weaving string around the poems and footnotes of the original material....not that anybody asked for that. Disney, stick with original material, if you pick a fairy tail, STICK WITH THE ORIGINAL! Now, if you excuse me, I think I'll read again ""The adventures of Alice in Wonderland"" and maybe play Alice Madness Returns.",Alice Through the Looking Glass

143,Mahmood-Buttrumps,Yet More Disney Cash-ins Down the Pike.,1,29 May 2016,"As far as animated mock busters go, Alice Through the Looking Glass is one of the least bad. It is far from a good movie, but unlike most other animated mock busters the DVD cover for it was really cool, and again it does attempt to do things differently to its inspiration Alice Through the Looking Glass instead of blatantly ripping it off. How Alice discovers leeching off the classics from Walt Disney's lifetime is also in my opinion more believable and makes more sense than with Jungle Book or Maleicafant, so Alice Through the Looking Glass deserves some credit in this regard.The flash animation(not CGI as the trailer seemed to imply) is neither terrible or great. Some of the backgrounds are handsome and some of the colours nice, but most of it is rather flat and spare and the character designs(especially that of the main seal antagonist) are rather limited in movement and weirdly proportioned. The music is very often the opposite of toe-tapping, and was in need of more whimsy and less of the loud action soundtrack quality. There are some genuinely funny moments here, but not consistently. Much of the dialogue in Alice Through the Looking Glass is very bad, the dialogue between the villains being especially face-palm worthy(i.e. the 'places to pinch' line, the Cheshire Cat's not-sure-what-to-think facial expression mirrors exactly how the audience will be feeling).Alice Through the Looking Glass is short in length at only forty minutes and has some very sweet parts. Not all the pacing works however, some of it is efficient but some of it is draggy and like it was trying to stretch out the story and the running time. Regarding the story, while there are some funny parts(which is another big improvement over most animated mock busters), there's not a lot to it(most of it actually is very thinly plotted) and a good deal of it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Particularly true to this is the dynamic between the main characters, not since Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales has there been a weirder and more senseless dynamic/pairing in animation(I'd say it's even more so here), if the movie gave a reason for the pairing and why the mastermind was the carpenter and not the walruss it would have been much easier to swallow.As for the characters, they fail to engage, with the exception of adorable Alice. The mad hatteris incredibly annoying with a voice that makes the ears bleed, having no real personality or motivation and is saddled with the worst of the movie's dialogue, his constant pessimism didn't come over very realistically and instead rather forced and the rest of the characters are bland. The voice acting is a mix of flat and irritatingly over-eager, nobody apart from the voice work of the chain-smoking catepiller which has a cute factor without being shrill sounded like they were happy to do this.Overall, not particularly good and lacking in a lot of areas, but actually has its moments and is one of the better animated mock busters around(which is saying a lot, as most of them are dreadful). 2/10",Alice Through the Looking Glass

146,steveneven,"You will not waste your ""time"" on this sequel",5,27 May 2016,"In 2010, Disney's ""Alice in Wonderland"" was met with mixed reviews. Mia Wasikowska was criticized for her apathetic outlook on Wonderland, or more aptly called Underland. Tim Burton was bashed for making another family/fantasy remake. All around, the critical reception was not very good.Six years later and Disney and Mia Wasikowska return, but Tim Burton does not. Does Burton's absence make for a better ""Alice""? Does Wasikowksa become more interested in Wonderland (this time we are not Underland)? ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" revolves around Alice (Mia Wasikowska) who travels to Time's palace in hopes of bringing back the Mad Hatter's family- the Mad Hatter being played by Johnny Depp. As Alice rides around in the Chronosphere, a flying apparatus that allows her to travel through time, she soon discovers how set in stone time really is.2016 Alice definitely has an inferior plot the first. Alice having to destroy the Jabberwocky? How cool is that! Especially in 3D fun (although, if one remembers, the 3D version was not very good)! Here, Alice has to... get the Mad Hatter's family back? get her mom not to sign a contract? It is not terribly exciting compared to slaying a dragon. Yes, Alice goes in and out of time but to be fair, the audience is only treated to several flashbacks. Even then, no immediate danger is ahead. However, 2016 Alice is superior to 2010 Alice because of Wasikowska's performance. Here, Alice is strong, charismatic, and vulnerable all at the right times. Alice will not let sexist men tell her she cannot be a sea captain. Alice will prove to Time (Sasha Baren Cohen) that she can not only walk in his palace, but she can steal the Chronosphere from him. Alice will also greet the Mad Hatter with a vivacious and charming smile. She will also shed a tear for him in times of distress. This is a welcome change of pace for the audience because Wasikowska was as dead as the Jabberwocky in 2010 Alice. Alice had no charisma. No character development. You might as well hired a no-name actress to do the same job.Yet, 2016 Alice looks better than 2010 Alice. Director of photography Stuart Dryburgh did a fantastic job. Sets are purple, red, blue, and just about every Crayola color you can think of. The scenes where Alice rides up and over some waves during her time in the Chronosphere are truly breathtaking. 2010 Alice was drained of any color with its ugly grey hues. It was like the director of photography decided that the picture was too vibrant and decided to smudge all the colors. Ew. Albeit, ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" is not better than ""Alice in Wonderland"". For one, the film is absent of the whimsical and funny nature that Burton's film had. Here, death surrounds each and every character. The Red Queen is also more vicious and unrelenting than ever before. And, if editor Andrew Weisblum cut the film by 10 minutes, the film would be less ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" and more ""Toy Story 3"" (if you catch my drift). Likewise, what makes ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" worse than ""Alice in Wonderland"" is a lengthy middle section. It might be cool to see how the Red Queen became a vindictive, dictator-like person, or how the Mad Hatter got his hat, but there is nothing here that furthers the plot. It is a shame because the beginning is extremely substantive. The film starts with Alice and her crew trying to survive a swaying ship from sinking, where everyone will end up like Jack from Titanic. However, what redeems 2016 Alice is its use of 3D. Every time there is a close up of a character or every time a character sticks out their hand, I wanted to grab it. The 3D also benefits from the beginning action and Time's never-ending array of stopwatches. 2010's Alice had very dimensionless 3D where nothing popped out at me, and there was no depth of field. To be fair, I saw both 3D versions at the same cineplex and with the same 3D projectors. How is that for reliability!In the end, 2016 and 2010 Alice both have their problems. 2016 Alice sports a better Alice yet 2010 Alice sports a more whimsical movie. However, 2016 Alice should do. The visuals are absolutely breathtaking, and Alice is a better fit for Time's Palace than Underland. Yes, 2016 Alice is not as great as 2010 Alice, but it is still a decent excursion. You will not waste your ""time"" on 2016 Alice.",Alice Through the Looking Glass
147,evamatijevic,"It's a kids' movie, alright",4,16 February 2021,"This was a bore packed with some pretty effects. However, not pretty enough to distract you from everyone's horrible acting and script that was cliched nonsense, full of sentences that seem to be taken from ""Generator prompt list"" or somewhere similar.Alice was annoying in this. As a main character, her one job, in the absence of plot, was to lead the story and help it move forward. Instead, we were stuck with whiny, self-righteous babbling Barbie with Turkish/Indian TV inspired tendency to think aloud.Real star and protagonist of this movie was Time. He is just simple guy doing his job who wants to be left alone because he has seen it all, and I respect that. If they really wanted to do something original with this sequel, they should have named it Time vs Babbling Barbie and make it all about him fighting the thief who, for her own selfish reasons, threatens to destroy everything. Rating for that movie wouldn't be better than the rating for this one, but at the very least it would be one of those movies you don't mind rewatching every decade or so (which is more than I can say for Alice Through the Looking Glass). As for Red Queen, even though I don't understand why they tried so hard to give her and her actions background, she once again triumphs over her sister as a far superior character.To sum it all up, it's perfectly fine for the kids aged 0-12 to watch this movie as it bores you to death with stories about friends, and love and what not, but anyone older than that would be better off with something else.",Alice Through the Looking Glass

Sorry for you, Mr Hatter. Sorry for the poor, non-action-packed, unemotional, character- lacking 'n' chemistry-lacking plot... Oh, and the one I'm most sorry for is poor Humpty Dumpty. All that nasty running with his eye and hindering him (as if falling from the wall wasn't enough!

In fact, they were the only thing I really liked there (remember the smoke from Absolem's pipe, the cat-like moon, spear-bearers' run, Iracebeth's imposing palace, the Knave's cunning mimics and plastics?) Here - nothing of the kind... Disney doesn't cope with most of the sequels they make (see Pocachontas 2, for instance). There was a good piece in the story, though, when Alice tried to change the past and what followed (such sort of adventures doesn't happen in time-travel stories so often). But the plot itself... let's say so: Allie is just like in the first film (as brave and independent as modern teens usually are, but not in the least reminding a Victorian girl). Sacha Baron Cohen isn't as much acting, as... wasting his screen time (together with ours, you'd bet. And don't look at me like that, I'm not going to make a pun on the word 'time'. It's not that funny, blah).The only ones who were a bit more interesting (compared with the first film) are the Queens. Somehow, their characters were shown in motion (Racey isn't as bad as she seems, Mirana isn't so much good. We knew it from Burton's 'Alice' already, but there was some space to work on). Now, Racey doesn't become a 100% cutie, she's still quirked in her mind, but she at least has a motif. I only didn't get, why Mirana could not excuse earlier. Maybe she's just silly, and that explains all (mwahaha)One may ask, 'Why did you see the movie, then?' Just to relax, pals. If you seek rest in the evening, 'The Looking Glass' will do.

The art direction and design are uninspiring. Time, as one might imagine, lives inside a giant clock, operated by what are essentially vintage BB-8 robots. But it's dour and dark, and the days that Alice visits are set in rooms and houses and streets that don't offer any glimpses of the nonsense world that makes the stories themselves so unique.

Neither kids, nor adults, will find it dragging at any point in time.The story isn't too deep, good for kids, a tad more boring for adults (who will probably enjoy the FX eye candy more, as per critic reviews); the dialogue is okay but has a couple of cringe worthy lines that you'd expect out of a 3rd grader, trying to write his first script, instead of someone in Hollywood. I want to call the script, ""simple"". I personally find it lacking, perhaps shifted towards younger audiences more, on purpose, but in the end, it works fine. The acting ranges from okay to great, thanks to performances from Sasha playing as ""Time"", and a few of the secondary characters throughout the story. Mia's also eons better than what she was doing in the 1st Alice movie, and she did her best with what she was given.Thankfully, Depp's Mad Hatter wasn't the ""lead"" in this movie as much as before. His character is central to the plot of the movie, but takes a step back to Alice's performance, something the script got right for a change. Its a good family movie that will entertain a wide range of ages, but lacks the depth of a movie like Titanic or The Shawshank Redemption, that critics seem to be looking for.",Alice Through the Looking Glass

156,ChrisB1986,Great Teamwork,10,27 May 2016,"The characters; that's what brings this movie along and how it can be sized down.Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen really sold it. She is so proper and quirky and it's very attractive. She is definitely someone you'd want to talk to.I liked Anne Hathaway as the White Queen a lot, as well, more than ever before, even. They go well together, some people I like a lot: Anne Hathaway, Helena Bonham Carter, Julia Roberts, Meryl Streep, Jennifer Lawrence..Johnny Depp was the reason for the season, definitely worth trying to catch.Mia Wasikowska, the sweet Polish girl from Australia held the whole movie together all the time with her positive attitude!Sacha Baron Cohen was a good main actor. He seems very good as a person. He is smart and an entertaining actor.The supporting actors did a very good job, as well. I liked seeing the queens young because it was so cute and with their mother. The English are really nice in this and so is Mia Wasikowska.I think they put a great deal of positive work into this and were successful as a sequel to the 1st movie. The art in this was fantastic and mesmerizing. It's a good sign and very uplifting! Morally, this movie touched on a lot of things, I felt. It shows actors meditating on kindness and not worrying too much about bad things.",Alice Through the Looking Glass

And speaking of, what made me LOL was the scene at the Hatter's tea where they were pestering 'Time' with quotes about time..... ***chuckles*** I also loved the end where her mother becomes part of the crew of Wonder. Finally, I was deeply touched by the scene where Hatter assured Alice they would meet again in memories and dreams. It is in memories and dreams I do same with loved one who are now no longer with me...... Altogether a delightful film and something for everyone.. My favorite character is Hatter followed by his tea party mates..",Alice Through the Looking Glass

It certainly isn't for everyone but it might fill some time on day. But you arguably want more from a film that using it to just pass some time. It considers some very interest and intriguing ideas (the personification of time) that are lost in the time travelling aspect of the film, much like some of the narrative cohesion and tightness.

Time Travelling to find Tarrant Hightopp's family has really nothing to do with the film since it can be added in the previous film. Glass looks like Mirror Mirror film that teleport into fantasy land is similar to other Disney Films. Time travelling is something that is usual that the catch will be, time traveler can travel into past, but they aren't supposed to be seen nor change the history because something terrible will happen if they do so. Alice Through the Looking Glass cast delivers well that feels me in a fantasy world. I loved the way how Helena played as a childish mean girl who perfectly played as Red Queen. Hilarious pun lines are perfectly fits to add entertainment in the Film. However, the Alice Through the Looking Glass gives a good Fantasy feeling but it's not a Disney Fantasy film that would satisfy for someone who are looking for a unique Disney film that a Disney film should be.",Alice Through the Looking Glass

163,maurovicmarin,Family time,6,9 October 2016,"I wasn't sure what to expect from another Alice movie. The previous love for the characters jumped into this one too and do I even have to compliment Johnny Depp's acting skills once again? Hope not. Anyway, although at first I thought the plot was a bit forced, it turned out to be not so predictable.The movie starts to get interesting pretty soon and it has a good morale and more than just a happy ending, it has a double happy ending to be precise. But I must say, in my opinion, some things and facts are a bit too complicated for children, who during the movie should have more than a couple of but why mom?"" and might confuse them. As a fantasy movie it's pretty solid, the visuals are o.k. and it has original some original characteristics of course. As I was at about half movie I was going to rate it much worse, as things got too clogged and were happening without order, it was rather confusing for me,which I disliked. But it was actually pretty satisfactory when it all unfolded, making it a solid combination of fantasy and family movie. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to spend happily their evening in company of their kids (or parents). If you mind movies that don't logically connect all the facts and could make sense in our world, this movie is not for you, but if you are here to watch a movie that will relieve you of your negative thoughts and immerse you into a new world, you should give it a try!",Alice Through the Looking Glass

HOWEVER there is something so freeing about this movie and the way the actors and director pay homage to the stories written by Lewis Carroll ESPECIALLY Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter. I find that my heart absolutely melts and identifies with the vulnerability he can portray with just one single look. I find the mad hatter relatable and a lot easier to understand in this rendition rather than Disney's animated version. It's no surprise though- Tim Burton always delivers unique and quirky films that have this way of comforting the beast we call our mind- and I must say, that this is no exception.",Alice Through the Looking Glass
165,sie_francis82,"Better than the first, but that's not saying much.",3,4 July 2016,"There is a common theory that Lewis Caroll was high on LSD when he made up the story of Alice in Wonderland. A concept that wouldn't be completely misplaced given its lunacy and a particular insinuation of certain consumables affecting Alice and her state of being. The truth of how it became is far more innocent but it doesn't stop people making their own assumptions, much like the reasoning as to why it attracted Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. The 2010 movie was a cocktail of over-cooked CGI and relied heavily on its main ingredient, another haughty creation from Depp who, thanks to his Jack Sparrow fame, wore the mantle of one of the most prominent character actors of our generation. At the time the visuals were considered a revelation, but where they succeeded the script severely lacked and a much loved story was exhaustively drawn out. Muppets Most Wanted director James Bobin takes the helm (or the blame - depending on how you want to look at it) with all of the original cast returning to their roles including; Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Rickman, Stephen Fry and Mia Wasikowska as Alice.We find Alice at the beginning of the movie as the Captain of a ship which is threatened to be taken away from her unless she gives up her family home, a deal her Mother struck in a bid to avoid financial ruin. Feeling betrayed, Alice makes a run for it and finds a magic portal through a huge glass mirror. It doesn't take long before we're propelled back into Wonderland through a vortex of swirling colours and flashing images. An epileptic nightmare. Alice instantly finds familiarity in the form of Absolem et al before they inform her that the Mad Hatter is dying and the only thing that will save him is if Alice believes that his family are still alive. She then sets upon a mission to go back in time to warn them of the danger that may cause their death - This is the kind of story that seems to be clutching at the proverbial straw but at that definitive moment within the first 15 minutes of the movie, you know exactly what to expect.What made Alice in Wonderland so appealing was the premise of such memorable characters. Wasikowska seems to slip back into her role with ease, however, she had some practice playing a similar role in Guillermo del Toro's Crimson Peak (2015). It's not to say that she is a one trick pony, but it is difficult to distinguish variety in her performances. The introduction of (a very reserved) Sacha Baron Cohen as Time and a new antagonist has a promising start and receives the majority of the laughs. Unfortunately his character soon becomes second rate to Helena Bonham Carter's bellowing Red Queen and her painful over- acting begins to grate. Even Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter becomes a pathetic re-imagining as he limps through the movie offering very little performance. Namely, his forced lisp which makes his voice sounds like a creepy, old man that forgot to put his teeth in. The real shame is the misuse of the rest of the original cast who are forced to provide mere cameos in comparison to the lead actors. This is the final performance from Alan Rickman before his untimely death and the only regret is that he is barely given enough screen time to make an impact on the movie at all.James Bobin does very well to mimic the style of the first movie. The audience are dazzled with so much visually, it appears like a desperate attempt to make up for the distinct lack of story. Alice Through the Looking Glass is a lot more structured (believe it or not) than the first instalment but, once again, it suffers from irritating pacing issues and poor performances from their key actors. On a positive note, thanks to the hypnotic special effects this is an entertaining children's movie and, regardless of the crude insinuations, that is most likely what Lewis Carroll intended it to be when he told it to 10 year old Alice Liddell as they rowed down the Thames. Whether that was the intention of Tim Burton is another thing altogether. But for the adults, this one will send you a little MAD.",Alice Through the Looking Glass

167,Spenser-4,A Hot Mess,2,22 May 2018,"I really enjoyed the Alice in Wonderland film so I was looking forward to seeing this one. Alice Kingsleigh (Mia Wasikowska) is captaining her father's ship, The Wonder, escaping Malay pirates and giving orders to port while her crew is going to starboard but they escape anyway. She's a year late returning to London only to find that her father has died and her jilted fiancé Hamish has taken over. Her mother has agreed to sell the family's shares in the shipping company and give up The Wonder to save her home. Absolem (Alan Rickman) turns up and Alice follows him through the Looking Glass. The Hatter (Johnny Depp) is all depressed. He is haunted by memories of his family killed by the Jabberwocky. Alice has to get the Chronosphere from Time (Sacha Baron Cohen) and return to the past to save Hatter's family. The White Queen (Anne Hathaway) is there making strange gestures with her hands but with well-groomed eyebrows this time and the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) is back and apparently off her meds again. Then Alice wakes up and everything since she went through the looking glass was a dream while she was in the insane asylum. And the Hatter's family is fine, they have been living in an ant farm. The movie goes downhill from there.",Alice Through the Looking Glass
168,elsol-3,"Enjoyable, for what it is.",7,24 February 2017,"Whilst widely panned by critics, and considered inferior to its predecessor, ""Through the Looking Glass"" is hardly the travesty it has been made out to be. While it certainly takes a great deal of liberty with the original material it is based on, and lacks the energy and drive of the original, it dares to pace itself more slowly and give characters more heart than the original, pun intended. We finally get to see how the Red Queen came to be the decapitation- happy individual she has become, given a decent if slightly heavy- handed fable on the nature of time, and the movie focuses more on the key characters required to tell the story, rather than trying to spread it too thinly over many minor characters. Do I recommend this? Yes. It's not brilliant, but it's worth a watch, if one is in the mood for something a little more slower paced.",Alice Through the Looking Glass

This movie was what the word ""lackluster"" was made for. It pains me to say that. I love Lewis Carroll and I love Johnny Depp, but this represents the best work of neither. It's a waste of their talents, it's a waste of time and a waste of money. Indeed, I get the impression that even Johnny Depp recognized how weak this production was, and was only just punching the time clock to get it over and done with. Indeed, I really think this is the worst Johnny Depp performance ever. Most certainly the worst I've seen. So sad.",Alice Through the Looking Glass

It had the same feel of the first one, but went in a different direction than the first. ""Wonderland"" was more or less a reboot to introduce the characters and setting to a fresh audience, while ""Looking Glass"" explored more of the history of the characters and did a bit of expanding on some of the characters (e.g., The Mad Hatter, The Red Queen, and The White Queen). Alice travels back through Time (yes, time is a proper noun because Time is a person) to save The Mad Hatter's family, and in the process, she discovers more and more about the history of the characters listed before.

172,ladymulti,Fun little trip of a Children's Fantasy Flick,7,11 June 2016,"I think a lot of people are out to forget the one thing about this film: it is a family film that takes elements from a children's book to craft a story.Now, given that, it's not perfect. There are confusing bits and some strange acting from time to time but there are the brilliant bits as well.It's quirky and an interesting play with the Time Travel Paradox (a confusing conflict) mixed with the confusing world of ""Wonderland"". I do believe that is the mesh of confusion.A lot of the elements are play offs and adaptions of fragments of the books, just as was with the predecessor movie this is a sequel to. If you know the book you will see the randomness that is the Wonderland that the book has to offer while still given the unique story that this movie has to offer. I don't think many people pick up on the subtleties of the references (heck I did a book report in High School on the Alice books so I studied them).Well, as the story goes with Alice an adult now and choosing to make her own decision instead of having a man do it for her, her choices may come off as hard for her; and learning what's important from her friends in the other realm is equally important to her. A moral lesson learned as is a Disney trope for any film children will end up watching.Honestly, as a fantasy lover, and a lover of children's movies as well, I can seriously write this show off as being more in the children's category. If you watch some of the talks about production of the show it is clear that that is, indeed, their audience. That is not what I am basing my rating on, however (as I do watch cartoons every week).Now all that being said, I suppose I can clarify more precisely on the clarification of why the 7/10... Well, I've stated the acting is odd. Well, the characters are odd as they should be, but the acting seems odd and sometimes a bit weird and out of place and quite over-done on some parts. Truly, I found that the best character and the best actor of the film was that of Time, portrayed by Sacha Baron Cohen, whose films I do not ever watch and have only caught him in passing in other films. His personification Time itself and how he played of Depp's Hatter and the Mia's Alice was really wonderful.In the end, I actually quite liked the movie. It was fun and entertaining, though, a darker family/children's fantasy film.",Alice Through the Looking Glass

I don't really recall many details about the first one, the only thing I know is that I went in with huge expectations and came out disappointed. This time, I went with no expectations. The film didn't seem that good judging by the trailer, so I just went with an open mind, and this time, came out pleased. I can't say it is an awesome film that will stay engraved in my mind forever, but it is good fun. The film is entertaining enough, although it lacks pace at some moments around the middle of the story, and can be a bit boring. Whenever I notice myself wondering for how much time I've been in the theater, I know that the film isn't doing its job properly. That being said, the visuals are quite stunning and they really make you dive into wonderland. I found the acting to be lukewarm, with some exceptions (Johnny deep did do a wonderful mad hatter this time, as well as Helena Bonham Carter, who never fails to perform). I left the theater feeling not amazed, but pleased with the film. It was a fun experience, not out of this world but still fun, and I would recommend it.",Alice Through the Looking Glass

I was glad to see that there was no ""good vs evil"" fight, that this movie was more life-like, meaning rarely there are any ""bad guys"". 2) It elicited a few laughs. No, it's not the most funny movie, but it is amusing at times. 3) The most important for me was the fact that it wasn't a shallow fairy tale. It talks about not only about the importance of pursuing your dreams and not conforming to some common standard (like it was in the 1st part), but also about the importance of family, the melancholy and freedom of letting go, the meaning of time and what we live our lives for. 4) Almost forgot.

There were a few scenes in the movie that either didn't make sense or which I felt slowed the movie down. but overall it was a pretty good film, cleverly told and the CGI was actually pretty good.

However, alone as a movie, Alice Through the Looking Glass is a stunning Disney masterpiece and deserves to be watched with an open heart. This movie is a family movie and lives up to its promise of bringing families closer and teaching both adults and children difficult concepts such as time, promises and what hellos and goodbyes really mean to us. This movie should be watched not on a superficial level because every fairytale is not just about little girls and bunnies but each tale has a moral that parents want children to understand. Everyone can complain that the plot is too simple, or that Disney is doing this all for the money but when a family walks out of the theater and a child tells their mom, ""Mom, I learned something"" then my time was well spent and I don't regret a second of it. This movie is brilliant and I don't care if all Disney and Hollywood want is money, because that can't be completely true. Time is not money.

He certainly did not use LSD because it was not discovered until 1938 and the first use as a hallucinogen was 5 years later in 1943. He may have well been in a drug induced sleep and the resulting dream or nightmare was an influence in his storytelling. That being said, you can make up your own mind about his drug use.This story has always been one of my favorites and I liked the movie.

It is a good movie that is for sure, the characters are lovable (especially the Mad Hatter), we understand more of their backgrounds and the plot is rather interesting. BUT the main point of disappointment is the lack of this ""Tim Burton style"" throughout the movie. Although I can't really explain what was missing, there was a lack of maybe magic, fantasy, dream... in this adaptation.

187,kristoffer-holmquist,A visual spectacle that does exactly what it sets out to do,7,8 June 2016,"I only saw the first film from 2010 recently and decided to go see the second. While the first film was decent but dragged a bit in the latter half, the second installment has improved on nearly everything. As a family-friendly adventure film, Through the Looking Glass accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do. The story has substance from the get- go, while I felt the first one took a while to build up momentum since so many characters and places needed to be introduced. The acting is stellar, and apart from Mia Wasikowska I was particularly impressed by Sacha Baron Cohen who brings a new both nuanced and fun character to life. One of my major complaints is that, while the Hatter is certainly a main character and the March Hare and Dormouse also get a decent amount of screen time, other familiar faces are somewhat underused. I would've loved to see more of Absolem, Bayard, the Cheshire Cat and the White Rabbit. This is very much the Hatter's story, and it also explores the Red and White Queen's background more. Regardless of script or characterisation, this film is absolutely gorgeous to look at, balancing between the possible and the insane. Costume and set designers and the special effects department have done a wonderful job and must've had a lot of fun doing it.

The Mad Hatter and King of Time, for example, had really thick accents that made their spoken language hard to comprehend.But the major drawback to this movie was its naive portrayal of human nature that borders on the offensive.While it is certainly true that ""you can't change the past but can learn from it,"" which is demonstrated vividly throughout the film, the movie unfortunately propagates the misguided notion that you can somehow ***change other people.*** If one tries to do that in the real world, they almost always will be sorely disappointed.Unrealistic *physics* in movies (and stories) can be thrilling, and a lot of fun. But unrealistic *human nature* in stories, on the other hand, can give people false impressions about life and relationships -- not to mention that it makes it extremely difficult to relate to the characters in the story. Those characters might as well be robots or space aliens.In this film, the Red Queen is an abusive jerk -- supposedly all because her sister told a small lie to her when they were kids. The movie then tries to show the viewer that if it weren't for this one single childhood incident, then the Red Queen supposedly would've turned out fine. However, it is clear that she *already was* a jerk prior to that incident. And if it hadn't happened, then obviously, *something else* during her childhood would've ""set her off"" sooner or later, instead.So, as an adult, the White Queen thinks she can simply *apologize* to her abusive sister for that one incident, and then, the White Queen can finally *trust* her sister again?That is pure, wishful thinking that has absolutely no basis in reality. With those kinds of people, it's best to *keep one's distance* -- not to suck up to them like a masochistic doormat.Anyway, the next interesting relationship in this film is the one between Alice and her mom. Her mom isn't abusive like the Red Queen, but simply has a different outlook on life than Alice's. Instead of hoping that her mom would ""change,"" Alice instead could choose to just share in the things they both have in common, and leave the other matters alone. In other words, Alice could still have a good relationship with her mom, but a ***less close one*** than they might have wished for. Alice could still pursue her dreams while paying an occasional visit to her mom.Lastly, I'd like to examine the Mad Hatter's comment that ""you only get one"" family in life.This is just plain false.What about all the people who grew up in an abusive family -- who fled when they were teenagers, and later developed a close family relationship with a close friend's family, or with that of a future spouse? One of the main reasons I loved Avatar, and Tim Burton's 2010 version of Alice in Wonderland, is because of the inspirational theme of ""flying away and finding one's place"" in the world where you can be happy.This theme was sorely missing from the 2016 version of Alice Through the Looking Glass.All in all, this was a fun movie, but with a confusing and lackluster message.",Alice Through the Looking Glass
189,Poster_lamp,"It's a fun movie, but nothing new or revolutionary.",6,4 June 2016,"To start of, I found it entertaining, which is the main objective of a movie. That being said, it's a forgettable movie at best. And a cluster of rushed ideas at worst. All mashed together in CGI that at times, looked more like cut scenes in a ps3 game than a movie. The good parts are Alice. I like Mia Wasikowska's performance and she did great with what she was given. What she was given, however, could have been better. I liked the idea of Time as a character, but the way he was written pretty much ruined it for me. Top that with the over the top acting from Sacha Baron Cohen and you have a wasted character.The music is incredible. I do love what they did with the Alice theme from last time. The CGI was great at times. I liked the sea of time, or whatever. Can just imagine how it would have looked in 3D. I suspect it to look pretty bad home on my TV, though.A surprising amount of the jokes hit. Even though they are too many and mixed with the occasional slap stick moments. A few fun references and nods are also included. And that's pretty much it. Rest of it ranged from pretty bland to straight out bad. The movie opens with Alice captaining a ship under attack from pirates. Because reasons, I guess. From there we meet Hamish, who she was supposed to be married to in the last movie. He's a total dick. Absolem (Rickman) leads her an a chase throughout the house, ending at the titular looking glass. She walks through it and the story can finally begin. The hatter found some relic from the past, reminding him of his dead family. He states that its impossible for this relic to exist and because it does, his family must be alive. He tasks Alice with traveling through time to retrieve them, somehow. This lead to a lot of jumping back and forth in time, in an attempt at making this a sequel/prequel hybrid of sort that doesn't really work. As a stand alone story, it might have worked, but this mess feels rushed, stupid and tacked on. In an attempt at making all the characters you love, seem deeper, this movie gives you all the back story and answers you never asked for. Pretty much explaining why every main character are the way they are. What was whimsical and fun in the first movie, is now annoying. This goes for a few of the other characters as well, but most for Johnny Depp. He's becoming a parody of himself. To sum up. It's good entertainment, but will probably start slipping your mind as soon as you leave the theater. Still, it's probably a better experience in the theater than renting it on blue ray will be.",Alice Through the Looking Glass
190,Erinnmarieg,I loved it!,9,29 May 2016,"Don't understand the negative views at all. I thought it was great. I was worried about going to see it after reading the negative reviews but it ended up being better than I thought. More fantasy than the first one so if you love fantasy, you'll love this film. It was pretty dark too. Intro of new characters who I really ended up liking. The actors did great just like in the first one. It definitely focuses on Mad Hatter and Alice the most and I love those two characters together. I brought my almost 7 year old daughter who sat through it better than Zootopia. She definitely loved it and it is great for the kids. It also had me feeling different emotions. I felt a little terrified at times, in a good way, I laughed, and at times felt sad. The entire movie theater clapped when it ended so I'd say we all really enjoyed it. I will be buying it on DVD when it comes out!",Alice Through the Looking Glass
191,Joeyakers1,Simply Mad,5,26 May 2016,"Expecting very little from this film, I walked in with hopes that it wouldn't be 110 minutes of rubbish. Thankfully, I really had a great time with this film! Directed by James Bobin (The Muppets, Muppets Most Wanted) and starring Mia Wasikowska, Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter, 'Alice Through the Looking Glass' is a stylish sequel with heart and good messages for all ages.I was not a massive fan of 'Alice in Wonderland' back in 2010, but I still came out enjoying the performances and scenery presented by Tim Burton. When I heard Tim Burton wasn't returning, I was glad but also thought that nobody could recreate the colorful world that Burton had created. I stand corrected. James Bobin added more bright colors, and gave the film a lighter tone compared to Burton's 2010 box office success. Bobin, who directed the two recent Disney Muppet films, made the most of the 3D CGI world and truly made it his own. 'Alice in Wonderland' featured one of my favorite musical scores of 2010, so I was very excited to hear the music in this film. Fortunately, Danny Elfman returns with his whimsical and exuberant score which was featured in the first. Mostly with a choir effect, I really enjoyed the musical score when it was copied from the 2010 film. The original song is ""Just Like Fire"" by P!nk, which plays throughout the credits. Just Like Fire is a already a chart-topper around the globe.Alice and Hatter are the central characters in this film, and they are played very well by Wasikowska and Depp. Time is the new villain, but I found he was very under utilized but Sacha Baron Cohen gave a cheeky and pleasant performance. Anne Hathaway and Helena Bonham Carter also return as the White and Red Queens. Anne Hathaway was once again delightful as the White Queen, as was Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen who had a magnificent screen presence. The screenplay by Linda Woolverton (The Lion King, Maleficent, Alice in Wonderland) is charming and witty but sometimes has cringe lines which involve characters explaining the plot, which is very frustrating. But you have to remember, that this is a family friendly film and in that aspect I think this film succeeds. Die hard fans of the novels will be disappointed with this film as it doesn't stay true to Lewis Carroll's Alice series.Alice: Through the Looking Glass is definitely more family-friendly than the first, and it will be highly enjoyed by families around the world. The performances are great, it was directed very well and the CGI was colorful and vibrant on screen.",Alice Through the Looking Glass

The only thing this film has to do with anything from the book is the characters. The story is as ridiculous as the absolutely exhausting Red Queen baby talking and The Mad Hatters stupid lispy over acting. Both are equally annoying through the entire film. You actually just want to shake Johnny Depp and beg him to stop. I understand film makers taking some creative license in adapting a book to film but this is just pathetic. I can't understand how this movie was even allowed to be released with the title of Alice Through the Looking Glass.

198,leptir_bez_krila,"Weird reviewS – A very big surprise, did not expect this",7,6 October 2017,"First of all, I want to say that I am not a big fan of the first movie, directed by Tim Burton. I thought it was an OK movie and nothing more. When I heard about this sequel, I couldn't care less. And the trailers didn't do much either to get my interest for the movie. So it took ages before I saw this film. And mama mia, was I wrong about it. This is, in my opinion, one of the most underrated movies that came out this year. It's more interesting than the first one, with a far more interesting story and concept. And in the end, it has a really good message for children about time and how we should use time the best way we can, and that the most important thing is our family. The directing is solid, on par with the first movie. The acting is OK, with some good CGI. The music and art direction is actually were the movie shines. There are some incredible beautiful scenes in this movie. It's definitely eye candy for children but adults too. It is a good family movie, and I would never thought that I would say this, but now I feel sad that this movie didn't do better at the box office. And actually really surprising, after all the first movie made over 300 million domestic and over 1 billion worldwide. So what really happened here ? But they could definitely use more time, especially in the beginning, for characters and story. The movie would gain more momentum and be stronger. Most of the CGI is great, but there are some scenes with bad CGI in it. This movie is definitely a step forward, and I would like to see a third movie, but I doubt we will get one. Families will enjoy this and children will learn one or two thing with this movie too. In the end, I would recommend this movie to everyone, go buy it on blu ray. Christmas is coming, and this will definitely be a great gift for every child who didn't see this movie (according to the box office of this movie, there's a lot of children who didn't see this film). This is a good movie, with more pros than cons. + Visually impressive + Art Direction + Very entertaining - They could take more time for character development and story - Some bad CGIGOOD - 7/10",Alice Through the Looking Glass
199,nicolethomas28,In the minority because as many critics fail to see there is a good plot to through the looking glass!,9,23 July 2016,First of all I was hesitant to watch through the looking glass partly because of bad reviews but mostly because my favorite director Tim Burton didn't direct this movie. I finally watched through the looking glass and I was pleasantly surprised! Beautiful graphics and visuals and a touching plot about the importance of not taking those you love for granted...and not taking time for granted. This movie shows how we all learn from our pasts and that we cannot and should not want to change the past. It seems a majority of the critics could not put two and two together to understand or appreciate the message this film conveyed. Shame on you critics ... curiouser and curiouser. ..why half of you can't comprehend. Maybe lacking neurons and brain cells ? Wonderful job done by the actors and actresses as well as the director trying to add some spice to a worldly well written classic by respected author Lewis Carroll,Alice Through the Looking Glass
200,yi-ying_lu,Worse than anything,2,24 September 2016,"CONTAINS SPOILERSAbsolutely terrible. It only made up from a one to a too because of the sort of okay acting and visuals. Sorry script writers and directs. I hate the characters. Alice should not have stolen the chronosphere. Everything is all her fault. You find just what a despicable character the white queen is, not just an airhead. The whole ending was just sappy and terrible. That's not how the real world works. All those cheesy morals just doesn't fly with me. Sure, maybe children will love it, but I think parents should not, I repeat DO NOT take your kids to watch this. The morals are just terrible.

I don't know why this movie is getting so much hate from other reviewers, if you go into the movie expecting a deep, meaningful movie with Oscar potential as it seems some of these folk do then you need to give yourself a shake because it's not gonna happen, it's a happy go lucky Disney movie with enough about it to keep you entertained I promise you that. It goes along at a steady pace to keep the kids interested and I thought the actors all gave decent performances, and as always Johnny Depp is delightfully wacko and zany, to be honest I thought it was a super fun movie and I would recommend it to family's and adults alike.",Alice Through the Looking Glass

The only thing good about this film is they didn't make the hatter gay and Alice a lesbian. Surprised the hightops weren't intermarried either. Oh, and Sasha kept his clothes on. 3/10 for that.

204,Rooster-Reviews,Alice through the looking bore...,4,30 May 2016,"Alice Through the Looking Glass is the second attempt by Disney Studios to deliver a live action take on the classic tale. Unfortunately, no improvement or effort has been made over the last 6 years to make a compelling story or plot with compelling characters. This time we see Alice return to Wonderland or ""Underland"" to save the Hatter by going back in time to significant events in Wonderland's past. The biggest positive I can give about this film are the scenes in the real world. These beginning scenes gave Alice some needed depth. I thought the costumes were excellently done and the CGI scenery for the most part was pretty to look at. I also mildly enjoyed the character of Time, played by Sasha Baron Cohen, who by far was the most interesting character and had the best lines in the entire movie. Now for the negatives. There is not a single scene in this entire movie that I felt had any depth or substance. It was just Alice jumping from one scene to the next. The acting was flat and the CGI characters looked liked a cartoon. This made the film very disjointed, uninteresting, and felt like the screenwriter was improvising every scene and just finally gave up. I recommend you waste two hours watching this mess of a film and instead read the original Lewis Carroll book. You can thank me later.

I really liked this movie, but they had never explained what I wanted them to this whole time. How did Iracebeth escape prison? At the end of Alice is Wonderland, Mirana said that she would be imprisoned for all of her days, so did she let her out? Did she escape? They never said and that is why I gave it a 7 out of 10.One more thing I didn't really like is that Alice basically went to the past for nothing, she didn't really change anything.

Unfortunately, the film did no justice to Lewis Carroll's' stories of wonderland however putting the book aside the film impressed me regardless. I enjoyed the story line, I think one notable fault is that it was somewhat predictable which made me worry that it would also be dragged out and tiresome but that wasn't the case at all, I was entertained throughout. Due to so many poor critic reviews I was expecting the worst from the story line, but now after seeing it I would say those reviews were unfair, granted the plot was quite simplistic it still managed to be enjoyable regardless of whether you're an adult or a child, it truly was a movie that was made for everyone. There was significant improvement in Mia Wasikowska's acting in comparison to the Alice in Wonderland that was released in 2010, I think without Sacha Baron Cohen the film wouldn't have been nearly as good. I was surprised that Sacha Baron Cohen was casted to play Time but he did a terrific job he portrayed various emotions and did them all wonderfully. I was also surprised that Johnny Depp didn't feature in the movie as much as he normally does but during his scenes he acted well, however Anne Hathaway is a brilliant actress but I don't think she worked to her potential in this film.",Alice Through the Looking Glass

It is really rare when the second movie beats out the first but this one does just that. This movie is like taking you on an amusement park ride. This truly was a fun movie. Johnny Depp as ""The Mad Hatter"" truly owns his part for a second time. The makeup for Hatter once again made the character come to life.

This was a fantasy film, and they succeeded in the fantasy realm. The story lines kept us wanting more; and more importantly, we didn't look at the time at all (yes, that's a gauge for us, how many times we check the time to see how much is pain is left). To us, the time flew by, we felt like we'd just finished an awesome roller-coaster ride and wanted to ride again! That all being said, my daughter and I found this latest version of Alice completely entertaining and thoroughly enjoyable from beginning to end (we really loved the opening scene especially)! I'm a bit confused by the expectations of many, it makes no sense to me. This story has been around for decades (over a century), so they needed to spruce it up a bit, and did a superb job of it. The actors were fantastic, the CGI drew you in, and the multiple story lines kept you guessing and wanting more. Of course the movie was going to be ""strange,"" that's been the base for this story-line since its' inception! Hello?

I also understand that it's very hard to make a movie, especially a good one, so I generally try not to give much attention to bad movies or waste my time and energy bashing them.With ""Alice Through the Looking Glass,"" though, I feel like I have to put my opinion out there. I'm in the minority with this one in that I loved ""Wonderland"" and was incredibly excited to see ""Looking Glass."" Having finally seen the movie, I'm really disappointed. I feel burned.Tim Burton directed ""Alice in Wonderland"" but chose not to direct this one - in his place is James Bobin, director of the two most recent ""Muppets"" films (the first of which I thought was great, the second much less so but still fine). I think it would be unfair to put all of the blame on him, but he's certainly responsible for some of what went wrong here... as is screenwriter Linda Woolverton, who I almost can't believe is the same person who wrote ""Alice and Wonderland,"" ""Maleficent,"" and the original ""Beauty and the Beast."" While her previous work is whimsical but subtle and sophisticated, ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" is an uninspired mess, and I can't help but suspect that she really didn't care about this at all.You know, it seems like almost no one involved in making this movie cared. Mia Wasikowska is probably the only member of the cast who deserves any praise, and I thought she did an even better job playing Alice here than she did in the first movie. Everyone else though, ESPECIALLY Johnny Depp and Anne Hathaway, should be embarrassed. Johnny's Mad Hatter was one of the best things about the first one, but here, he's just really weird and annoying. Like, super annoying...I don't even think the composer, the usually amazing Danny Elfman, put forth much of an effort here. The score for ""Alice in Wonderland"" is one of my favorite scores for a movie ever, but it's like for this one, he thought he could just recycle the stuff he wrote for the first one and that no one would notice? Well, I did, Danny. I noticed.The visual effects and production design are pretty great, as they should be, but you never get that sense of wonder or escapism that you should get with a movie like this because so much of the movie is just people standing around bantering or delivering boring exposition. The movie is loud and sometimes frantic but rarely fun or engaging. It's a major disappointment and a major step back from ""Alice in Wonderland"" and Disney's other recent live-action fairytale adaptations. It's just not good.",Alice Through the Looking Glass
214,BlueCrimsonGirl,Alternative ending with any adaptation could have saved it,7,29 May 2016,"I watched the movie and loved it, minus the cheesy off rail ending.. I feel that a little adaptation from the original book could have done this movie wonders.. For example instead of the cheesy HI- TOP family thanking Alice and the hatter +contract nonsense with the mother they could have just had the hatter wonder if Alice is a dream as she is leaving the looking glass (original book ) and Alice could wonder if life itself is just a dream.... Also this movie could have benefited from Sacha Cohen doing a better accent than his french Les Mis accent. The hatter could have been a more well thought character and Johnny Depp brought very little to it.",Alice Through the Looking Glass
215,jtbunch,Three Words: Waste of TIME,1,3 June 2016,"This film is a classic example of a studio's desire to make money. The first one did so well, over a billion dollars world wide, that they felt they had to make a sequel. Well, guess what studio! It will take a miracle for this film to make as much as the first one. Overall the film was terrible. The story was terrible. The acting was terrible. In fact, to me it seemed as if they dumbed down the characters. The characters, including Alice, were not very likable. The best scene in the movie is the opening scene. In this scene Alice is portrayed as smart, daring, brave, and a strong leader. Then she gets to wonderland and she suddenly makes a lot of decisions without really thinking them through and they aren't good. The special effects. I don't know that I would call the special effects terrible, but they were definitely over done. Cinematography, not impressed. The occasional close facial shot is nice, but this film has way too many. In the end, it was a WASTE OF TIME! Not only a waste of my time, but a waste of the studio's time. It took them six years to make this film. They clearly did not use their time wisely. I recommend the studio executives re-watch this film, assuming they have already seen it.

217,lilnellster,Negative Reviews Are Simply Being Melodramatic,9,28 May 2016,"No. This movie does not correspond with the book of the same title, I can sort of understand why people would be a little disappointed with that, however!! for those claiming that the plot doesn't make any sense or that it is all over the place; have you ever read a Lewis Carroll book??? I genuinely thought that all of the acting was perfectly suited to the style of the movie, the special effects were beautiful and as whimsical as I would have hoped for being an Alice story and although it may not have been a match to the book, it is a completely believable (in relation to Alice and her friends) extension of what Alice could have become as an adult.Those leaving shockingly low ratings are simply being way too melodramatic about the authenticity of it (or lack thereof) and quite honestly dull. It is a beautiful, fun and wonderfully bizarre film. Kids will love it just as much as grown ups!",Alice Through the Looking Glass

219,kbtvs,A watchable adventure,5,4 January 2017,"First let me state that Alice through the Looking Glass is NOT a bad movie but there's a few reasons why I only gave it a 5/10.The plot of the movie revolves around the time honoured classic of time travel and making sure that the future isn't altered through travelling back into the past... its been done a thousand times, however I have no problem with that as it makes for enjoyable viewing.The time travel aspect of the movie was done well and its interesting to see some of your favourite characters from the first movie in the past as well as learning a few things about The Mad Hatter and The Red Queen that were not told in the first film.Mia and Helena are the stars of this movie for me , I know everybody loves Depp and his portrayal of the Mad Hatter but I much prefer some of the other characters in this movie.Although I liked the film I just felt like it was lacking something. It seemed as though the studio spent too much time on making the film visually stunning and kind of missed the important part which was the storytelling.All in all it lost its muchness.",Alice Through the Looking Glass
220,kim-liz-cass,Oh the effects...,3,10 May 2018,"I'm not even done watching to film, I'm about 10 minutes from the end but I'm so disinterested by it that I thought I would write a review while the final scene plays. I think this title is very much a testament to the fact that money does not buy you a decent movie. Effect after effect after effect after garish colours and CGI animals. My goodness, if they had paid their tech guys a little less, and their story-writers a little more we may have had something good here. (Although in my opinion they were finished by the first movie in this series with the casting of Alice. What a vapid and uninteresting actress.) Through the Looking Glass by Lewis Carol is a beautiful story, and while I know they're not exactly going for a retelling, they could have thrown a few nods to it here and there. Overall, very disappointing. But in true Disney fashion, it is a pretty thing to watch.",Alice Through the Looking Glass
221,sophiaserpa,"I loved this film, but if you're expecting a ""book accurate"" adaption, this film is not that.",8,28 May 2016,"I had seen a lot of negative reviews about this film before I went to see it and now that I have watched the movie I'm rather irritated by the criticism it got. I'm someone that has read and loved both of Lewis Carrol's Alice in Wonderland books (they are actually my favorite classic novels) and I absolutely loved this film, not because it's like the book, but rather because it took the idea of Alice in Wonderland and its characters and created a new, interesting story. There was so much criticism saying that this film is nothing like the book, which is somewhat true, but neither was the Tim Burton film that was done before this one. Burton's Alice in Wonderland was inspired by a single poem from the novel Through the Looking Glass (The Jabberwocky) and also referenced Down the Rabbit Hole, but still had its own original storyline, just like this film did. There was also much criticism saying that the story was hard to follow, which I found to be quite the opposite. This film did a bit of hand holding and lead the audience through the plot to make sure everything was clear, but I personally find the criticism of an Alice in Wonderland film having a ""hard to follow plot"" a ridiculous criticism because anyone who read Lewis Carroll's novels knows that the ""plot"" is practically nonexistent and the point of the novels is the adventure, creativity, and absurdity. I personally loved much of the nonsensical banter in this film, but could see how it would confuse someone trying to make sense of it and apply it to the plot, but again I make the argument of previous adaptions doing this and being praised. Disney's animated Alice in Wonderland for instance, has just a tad more of a plot than Lewis Carroll's novels, but is still filled with even more nonsense than this film and yet it was better received and I think this is due to today's audiences expecting an epic tail with a complex plot when they go to see a film rather than simply enjoying movies as a creative art form. Another criticism I saw was that the visuals weren't as good as the previous film which isn't true. Yes the previous film used a bit less CGI and a darker pallet, but that was Tim Burton's choice as a director and a design technique that fit that films tone. This film used a much brighter colour scheme and tended to have more CGI characters, but this is because this film is meant to be much more lighthearted and there were many more characters that were too complex in design to not be CGI, but those characters were still unique and creative as well as properly rendered and well animated. I think most of the bad reviews of this film come from people who were expecting a true adaption of Lewis Carroll's book Through the Looking Glass-which, lets face it, would not have been well received either because of it's ""nonplot""-. Or maybe the reviews are from people expecting another Tim Burton film-which this isn't, it's directed by James Bobin-. Or perhaps they come from people that would have liked a child Alice and then would have been more willing to accept all of the nonsense, childlike behavior and excitement Alice had in this film. In short I loved this film, and this is coming from someone who loves Lewis Carroll's books and who is studying film. If you're expecting a ""book accurate"" adaption, this film is not that, but it is still creative and fun and does capture the essence of Carroll's books, so I would suggest you go watch it and form your own opinion, but the only advice I would give is to go into this movie with the open and adventurous mind of a child.",Alice Through the Looking Glass
222,safaa_jolha2,I loved every second of it !,9,20 September 2016,"Literally every second of this movie is worth watching ! it's even better than the first one. I love the visual effects, maybe that's why I loved this movie so much, I mean the nature in Underland, the time castle, much effort was put on this movie and it was worth it . I wasn't expecting that much of it, since I didn't expect a good story. But the story of Time is incredible ! And those little seconds of his are so cute, I liked the idea of the white queen not being totally good by lying in her childhood and being part of the reason that made her sisters' head big. I wish there were more parts for the Cheshire cat, I love his grin :D. But, finding The Hatter's family could've taken more light, the hatter just finds them and that's it. We should've got the opportunity to watch more of them after they come back. Still, this movie's became one of my favorite fantasy movies .",Alice Through the Looking Glass
223,jayandre,A Good Example of Hollywood's Failures,1,30 May 2016,"Before I shatter this film, I would like to say that I do respect the filmmakers of Hollywood (somewhat). They are creative geniuses that have transcended the art of filmmaking time and time again. They have continuously pushed the boundaries, especially when it comes to bringing astounding visual effects to the big screen.However, the art of storytelling has become lost on them. This is primarily because conglomerates have bought out the studios. A movie is merely a commodity to the shareholders. The question they pose themselves before financing a movie is this: Do we already have a built in audience for this story? If there isn't already a built in audience, good luck getting the film financed. With that being said, it is clear that storytelling is the last priority of Hollywood. Through the Looking Glass is a prime example of this. No matter how many groundbreaking visual effects they throw on the screen, the plot stinks. There was no suspense. Very little irony. No interesting characters. No memorable scenes. No compelling conflict and dynamics between the characters. The entire premise of the film was based on Alice saving the Mad Hatter from his illness. Yet, I could really care less. The story reflects nothing about the human condition. It raises no intriguing questions. Not to mention that the plot itself is aimless and disjointed. It meanders along, zipping in different directions without a clear focus and purpose. One wonders how a script like this even gets greenlit. Maybe this is what audiences have come to accept. Maybe it's our culture that is the problem. However, I won't lay down without making my voice heard. When the credits rolled, I personally booed the film. My girlfriend tried to get me to shut up.Story is a metaphor for life. Compelling characters represent something about each of us. We relate to them on different levels. We witness the actions they take, and say ""Ah, I would've done the same."" or ""Wow. I would've never done that, but I can understand why they did it."" The problem with fantasy films like this is that they are so far disconnected from reality that they literally represent nothing. So I shall pose a challenge to those reading this review who have seen or intend to see this film: watch Alice, then watch a movie like Birdman, The Social Network, Nightcrawler, Fury, or a TV series like Breaking Bad, then compare the two. I guarantee that you'll find yourself much more emotionally fulfilled upon watching one of the films I mentioned. Not all superhero/fantasy films are trash. But Through the Looking Glass was an egregious example of all special effects, but a junk plot.",Alice Through the Looking Glass

226,Governess666,One Of The Best Disney Movies I've Seen In a While!,10,3 November 2021,"I'm not sure what people are complaining about. This movie actually has substance. Even better than the first one, in my opinion. I was so impressed that I just had to make an account to let my voice be heard even if it's within the minority out there. And because I find the criticisms so irrelevant compared to the important ideas the movie is trying to achieve.Common irrelevant complaints are:""It's not like the book!"" - Obviously it isn't, go read the book if that's what you wanted all along. The book is of nonsense things, it wouldn't look good on the big screen.""There is so much CGI, it was obvious they weren't looking at anything"" - I was too engrossed to even realize this. You want something to look more real? Go outside and look at actual nature, or better yet, go make a movie yourself! The scenes in the movie were mesmerizing!""Johnny Depp this.... or that..."" You're judging the movie based on personal feelings about his career, not on his acting chops. When actors play many parts that tend to be similarly silly or serious etc., we are biased to think they are 'acting the same'. His acting here is very obviously different and distinguishable than in other movies he's been in. You've seen him so many times in so many movies that you're projecting your own lenses of sameness when you've seen him in ""this and that"". How many distinguishable silly faces can you make? Don't they all tend to look like the same silliness with your other silly faces you silly made, silly?Now to the actual goodies and the lessons I learned and I hope kids will pick from this too...Friendships, they are important. Friendship means believing, trusting, being loyal, and helping your friends, even if the world is against them, even if you haven't seen them for years.Family. We only have one of them. We must try to understand them, even if they are being unreasonable.Individuality. If you know who you are as an individual, you are not afraid to take an unusual path, even if it means being laughed at by others. You know your own truth and you don't act against your better judgement.Imagination. You don't use it to put yourself down. You instead use to your advantage, to come up with answers that will help you in real life.",Alice Through the Looking Glass
227,chautran,Highly enjoyable though,7,1 October 2016,"Just enjoyed Alice Through the Looking Glass...​ and it was totally satisfying.. from the very beginning. I don't see why it was so underrated and seen as a failure compared to the first movie. This sequel keeps up the spirit of Alice in Wonderland, telling a traditional old story about time travel and lesson of how much of our little action can play a role in the flow of time and so on in a very interesting way I have to admit. The plot was well-written, background music was excellent and above of all: the work of our main cast was laudable!! Mia, as always, brings the best out of this kind of character: a brave, headstrong and perky young lady holding her own destiny in her hand with an unbeatable belief in the impossible; and Depp actually did not disappoint me at all with his come-back as Mad Hatter; his performance is way more amazing than in the first one. The story of his character in Alice Through the Looking Glass is so tailored to embrace his acting talent! He successfully performed an emotional childlike Jack Sparrow called Mad Hatter haha. And Anne and everyone else did a lovely job. So yeah, it was a worthy afternoon to me.. And a gentle reminder of how scattering of IMDb scores can go.",Alice Through the Looking Glass
228,jonathanandersonstewart,Read the book,1,8 February 2017,"The Book ""Through the Looking Glass,"" like it's predecessor, ""Alice's Adventures In Wonderland,"" is a charming and witty piece of nineteenth century political satire which is based on a chess game (unlike it's predecessor, which is based upon a card game). But like it's predecessor, it works both as satire (for adults) and fantastic adventure (for children). Both books were written for the Alice Liddle, a young girl at the time and friend of author Lewis Carroll, a childless clergyman and mathematician. The original Disney animated film combined the books much more accurately and never went so far over the top as to lose the essential spirit of the originals. Even the political satire was still present, though dulled by time and overwhelmed by the magic of animation. However, this film and it's predecessor concentrate almost exclusively on eye-popping visuals and fantastic everything, losing sight of the political satire altogether. Plus, the absurd shipboard wrapper to the basic story is totally unnecessary and misleading. Apparently, two screenplays were mashed together in an awkward and contrived effort to reinvent the story for today's audiences. Why? Obviously, to showcase the (admittedly) extraordinary computer graphics and special effects skills Hollywood currently has at its disposal. And give the actors another chance to dress funny, wear weird makeup, and act crazy. The original story is fantastic, agreed, but it is a lot more than that. Both of these new interpretations stop at the fantastic and miss all the rest. Turn the sound off and ignore the naval wrapper, try to forget the original books, and this film can be enjoyed as a visual feast. It might help to get high first. Otherwise, you may wonder if anyone was actually in charge. Maybe everyone was in charge!You more serious viewers, try watching Disney's animated ""Alice In Wonderland"" from 1951 and Jim Henson's ""Labyrinth.""In the world of traditional art, one basic rule of thumb is ""Less Is More."" Here, we get, as with so many of today's special effects driven films, ""More Is Less.""",Alice Through the Looking Glass
229,AZFalcon24,"""Time is not someone you want as your enemy""",4,6 June 2016,"I did not see Alice in Wonderland (2010), so I didn't really have a reference point for this sequel. It turned out to be a watchable movie, although it contained nothing which you haven't seen before.Let's start with the story: Alice (Mia Wasikowska) goes back to Underland through a looking glass where she finds out that the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) is stranger than usual because he saw the first hat he ever made, which he thought was lost, thus believing his family is still alive. Alice then travels through time, trying to save the Hatter's family before they are destroyed.Time travel stories usually need sharp and clever writing in order to avoid illogical and inconsistent storytelling, this movie more or less achieved this, however the story was amazingly predictable and clichéd, the dialogues sometimes were really dull. One exception was the scene when the Mad Hatter and his tea-party mates cracked jokes at the expense of Time (Sacha Baron Cohen), that was brilliant.That brings me to the characters and the actors portraying them: Mia Wasikowska was solid as Alice, Johnny Depp brings his usual quirky mannerisms to his role (eerily similar to a certain Captain), the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) had absolutely no business being in this movie, she literally did nothing through the whole time. My favourite character was the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter), her character development was sensible and well portrayed. On the other hand, Time started out as an interesting character, but his love for the Red Queen felt forced and during the course of the film you began to feel that you can't take him serious.Just one more thoughts: The Chronosphere ending was just plain stupid, Alice could have just dropped it in its spot before the rust froze her.Final verdict: 4/10 As I first said, nothing groundbreaking or innovative, typically a movie which you only watch once.",Alice Through the Looking Glass
230,cristoreyenlinea,Enjoyable from start to final credits!,10,27 May 2016,"Visually stunning and with a captivating story, this movie is enjoyable from start to end. Centered on time management, it gives lessons on how to get the best of every second and how useless is trying to stop it or reverse it. It also breaks the old ""time is gold"" quote. Alice is now less innocent and fearless, defeating Time (the character) while moving through mind blowing past time scenes. Between the lines there are lessons on honesty, friendship, family love and respect. Each next scene is so unexpected that you won't get any chance to loose attention. Imagination at its highest degree, the intricately colorful Burtonish locations, changing at lightning speed, are a most-see jaw dropping spectacle any member of your family will want to experience more than once. I saw it in an Imax cinema in Santo Domingo. The 3D rendition and sound are fantastic.

231,doogperson,What. Is. Happening.,5,28 May 2016,"Let's start with the pros of this movie. The score provided by Danny Elfman was beautiful, with a nice improvement on the original Alice (in Wonderland) theme and more great new music to match. The CGI and practical effects were great, with some nice cinematography as well. The designs of the items and places were very cool, with the costumes in particular really suiting the characters (""if it's good enough for the Dowager Empress of China it's good enough for the Ascots!"").However, this is all in service of a story so lunatic and untrue to the first one that not even the Hatter could've made it up. In the first movie, things made sense. ""Alice slays the Jabberwocky"" is a simple goal (for Alice) and an inevitable climax. Now, Alice must...time travel? Get her mom to not sign a contract? Return and/or steal the Chronosphere? Come to terms with the inevitability of Time's march and not have crushing existential crises with the realization that all these concepts suddenly have corporeal manifestations?! This script is A MESS! I truly am sorry that all the people involved who were committed to this project had to see it through to its manic finish.

The actors/actresses did wonderful - no complaints there - and the writers did a great job as well.

The heroine tries to define herself as she is divided between settling down to a life she doesn't want or embracing the unknown. This is also reflected in her journey. At the beginning she seems to be a much lesser version of her true self. She has to decide who she wants to be and when the movie ends she has found her place. The film is dark, targeted mostly to teenagers and adults which is an excellent choice.The second movie though is just a shameful money grab. Nothing is added to the story, the characters have no depth and Alice's journey is just superficial. The fact that it is targeted to young kids makes matters even worse when ridiculous jokes come up destroying the mood completely.

Very entertaining for both of us and not disappointed at all and having spent the money on movie tickets. We enjoyed all of the cast and the plot had some surprises. After seeing 4 decades worth of movies one tends to anticipate just about every plot twist.. which has the benefit of making you look like a genius to the younger generation! One interesting take away from the movie is how similar (I thought) that Sacha Baron Cohen's 'Time' sounded EXACTLY like Christoph Waltz's 'Cardinal Richelieu' from the 2011 ""Three Musketeers"".

242,yunsongyili,"A mature fantasy full of ""muchness""",9,27 June 2016,"Instead of an extravagant fantasy that makes people temporarily forget about reality, Alice Through the Looking Glass is a beautiful fantasy full of life lessons encouraging people to appreciate life, believe in the impossible, treat family well, and keep dreaming. If that's not your cup of tea then the movie may indeed seem boring, especially if you don't catch onto many of the metaphors.After stealing the Chromosphere (a time-travel enabling device) from Time (a man who is the personification of time), Alice travels back in time with a mission to change the past in order to save the Hatter's family, and in the process learns of the mistakes, misunderstandings, and hidden feelings of those in Wonderland. Through it, her outlook on life changes. She realizes that 1) she was wrong to have not believed the Hatter—the one who helped her believe in herself and therefore slay the Jabberwocky during her previous visit to Wonderland—about his family being alive 2) she doesn't need to change the past to make things right in the present—she only needs to understand it 3) time is a gift—not a thief. The time travel also reveals the beginning of Iracebeth's (Red Queen's) vengeful heart from her childhood. After Mirana (White Queen) eats one of their mother's tarts and blames it on her, (mother believes the lie), Iracebeth runs out of the house and winds up with a head injury, which causes her to become self-conscious. At a ceremony later on, the Hatter laughs at how the tiara won't fit on her head, and the crowd laughs when the tiara breaks into pieces. In the middle of her outraged cries, her father states that she is unfit, and that the crown will go to her sister. She threatens revenge on all of them and later locks up the Hatter's family. The Red Queen takes the White Queen back to the stolen tart incident via the Chromosphere, but when given the chance to change the past, the White Queen refuses to. The old and young Red Queen then see each other which causes her to freeze. The White Queen carries her frozen body with her as the rest of the world starts to freeze. If not for Alice, they would have become ""stuck in the past"". Contrary to what is expected, Alice doesn't save the world from freezing ""just in time""; she's about two inches too far away from getting the Chromosphere back in place. However, a simple spark from the Chromosphere reverses the frozen world, seeming to say, 'all it takes is a spark'. The White Queen takes this opportunity to apologize to her sister, and Alice apologizes to Time for stealing the Chromosphere. Time says he is a friend to no one, but he won't forget Alice and tells her to never come back (aka don't make the same mistake twice).Upon returning to the real world (though, ""Whose to say which is which?""), Alice's priorities change. She puts aside her sentimental feelings for her deceased father's ship and agrees to sell it so that her mom can afford to keep the house and stop worrying about Alice. However, her mom has a change of heart. They keep the ship, open up a business, and go sailing together—contradicting what society tells them they should do.",Alice Through the Looking Glass
243,MaggiDot,Loved IT!,10,10 July 2016,"The CGI is amazing and the story brilliant. You get a bit more information about different characters and their background but there is also a message behind the story. It's the message that makes this movie special. Something you can relate to, especially if you have been through some rough times and time hasn't always been on your side. The music in the first movie was great and so was the music in this movie, really makes a movie more enjoyable if it has good music.I really really liked it, beautifully made and great story. It is an odd movie but what else would you expect? Just the right amount of action, story and humour for me :)Rest in peace Alan Rickman, Absolem.",Alice Through the Looking Glass
244,crisostomo_kricie,"Pressured by the impending need to finally grow up and give up the wonder, Alice walks through the looking glass and finds herself back in Underland.",4,7 August 2016,"The Six Impossible Things ""Alice"" Did Before the Credits RolledAlice through the Looking Glass is expected to keep the fairytale- adaptation ball rolling. With stellar cast and assumed long- awaited return to the Underland, it seems like it's simply impossible for this sequel to go wrong.Yet it still managed to make the impossible, possible.Alice 2hru starts three years after Alice's first adventure. Fresh from her voyage from the other side of the world, she learns that her mother sold their share of her father's company and she needs to give up the ship in exchange for their house. Pressured by the impending need to finally grow up, Alice walks through the looking glass and finds herself back in Underland and learns that Mad Hatter is madder than usual. It is up to Alice to save him by doing what even she thinks is impossible: sneaking into Time's castle, traveling back to the past, and changing it.Even without saying, we all know how it ends. Here are the other six impossible things Alice 2hru did before the credits rolled:IMPOSSIBLE THING # 1: Fail at the box office with such a huge budget. With a film budget of $170 million, enough to make eleven The King's Speechs, Alice 2hru is a let down grossing only over $282 million—considering that the first Alice film grossed over $1 billion. Low-budget movies turned blockbusters like Paranormal Activity relay on the viewers' word- of-mouth so most probably, Alice 2hru has failed to impress the audience prior to the rolling of credits.IMPOSSIBLE THING # 2: A stellar cast with unmemorable performances. The Alice books from where the film is loosely based are populated by whimsical, strange people. And who else could bring these characters to life but an ensemble that includes: the master of oddness and eccentricities himself, Johnny Depp; the ethereal, apt bride of Tim Burton, Helena Bonham Carter; and the charmingly mischievous Sacha Baron Cohen. Amazingly, as Mad Hatter, the Red Queen, and Time respectively, they all fail to inspire awe from the audience. This is not to say that their performances are wanting, in fact, they have delivered what are expected from them: their usual quirky selves. But this is also exactly why the actors are forgettable: we have seen Depp, Bonham Carter, and Baron Cohen so many times (especially the first two) in similar roles and they fade into the surreal background with ease. Anne Hathaway's bizarre White Queen on the other hand, albeit having shorter screen time but probably clearly remembered as the tragic Fantine, elicits delight as she dreamily speaks and flicks her fingers, and sashays her way through Underland.IMPOSSIBLE THING # 3: Overwhelming effects without lasting impression. Just by looking at the crowded, kaleidoscope-ish, toothache-inducing movie poster, one would know this movie will be a feast of visual effects—one that would leave the viewers with a bad case of indigestion. Sadly, the film is as advertised: it bombards the audience with colors, ruffles, and frills that, ironically, viewers can easily shrug off in anticipation—and preparation for the next overly done scene. Even the void of infinitude, where Time's Castle of Eternity is located, is not spared from dizzying grandiosity.IMPOSSIBLE THING # 4: Intense music that leaves no feeling of dread. Alice 2hru is an adventure movie so naturally it has a lot of will-keep- you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat scenes like the one where Time is chasing Alice through the Ocean of Time—or at least this is what this scene should have been. Despite the music aptly reflecting the mood of each scene, it fails to elicit any kind of sympathy from the viewers and this is largely because of the too predictable story the film chose to tell.IMPOSSIBLE THING # 5: Producing a pancake-flat adaptation from a rich source material. The director, James Bobin, said that Lewis Carroll's Alice books are ""unfilmable"". While not a few would agree, it is still not enough an excuse to explain the atrocities of Alice 2hru. The fascinating-sometimes-brutal exchange of ingenious dialogues that play with and make fun of the arbitrariness of language that contributed so much to the greatness of the two Alice books are reduced to bland one- liner puns in the film. The timing is so off the audience would snicker to mask the cringing. And let's not go to the over-all storyline. The plot of the movie is plain immature they should have hired a younger Alice and marketed it mainly for kids. Carroll's Alice books may have been childish and nonsensical on the surface but do not fail to amuse both the young and the young-at-heart—something that the movie failed to do.IMPOSSIBLE THING # 6: A Wonderland without wonder. Contrasted with the dark, dreary reality, Underland should have been a breath of fresh air, a way out, an escape. However, as the Hatter says by the end of the movie about dream and reality, ""Who's to say which is which?"" Which is which indeed! In reality, Alice believes impossible things are possible but the first thing she says when a challenge presented itself in Underland is that it is impossible. In reality, the actors are superb, eliciting genuine emotions from the viewers (Lindsay Duncan as Helen Kingsleigh is inspiring, Leo Bill as Hamish Ascot is delightfully annoying, Ed Speelers's non-verbals are charming, even Alice played by Mia Wasikowska is more interesting as the odd one out in reality). Also, it is more intriguing to ponder on what would have happened if Alice never escaped the institution than to watch an extremely predictable story unfold in Underland.Alice through the Looking Glass is a wonder in every possible way—wrong sort of ways. It is a wonder why we even have this sequel at all. But if you are one of the few people with time to spare, go ahead and look through the glass. You would be surprised what you would find there.",Alice Through the Looking Glass
245,LizaDonihue,Amazing Movie,10,8 September 2016,"I LOVED this movie so much! The makeup on the mad hatter was just absolutely incredible. I was blown away by how real and magical this movie looked. It actually exceeded my expectations. I think the acting in this film was perfect and I loved how they recreated it. It wasn't too much at all. I also think that the story line was perfect. I was so engaged in this film. There was never a spot where I zoned off. This is the kind of movie you can not go to the bathroom in the middle of. I think the visual effects were brilliant. There was definitely no mistake. I loved all of the colors in it as well, it made me feel happy. And I felt for every character each time something happened to them. All around incredible movie and I would suggest it to anybody that is wanting an upbeat film to watch.",Alice Through the Looking Glass
246,musubidespassko,Good movie to watch,8,1 December 2016,I was a bit surprised about other reviews telling that this movie was a piece of crap or whatsoever. Like there isn't so much to be expected from the movie since it is not really related to the story of the first one. Unless they expect it to be have some type of relation. I personally think it was a pretty good movie. It has a great story. Specially how the idea was conceptualized. And it was executed quite well.The abruptive type of scenes are present on the film. And it is much that i'm expecting on the movie. Where there are metaphors and resolutions to the conflicts that are done in bizarre ways which is a yes yes with tim burton sh*t. And these scenarios are done in a smooth way. not like other movies that they had to force weird stuff but felt like its not necessary.,Alice Through the Looking Glass

Alice's voice was annoying. No expression at all. I mean I'm no high-end critic, but jesus this movie was bad. I couldn't even sit through it, thank goodness I was watching it at home. Also, just for disclaimer's sakes, if you're watching this movie for the book itself, save your time, it's nothing like the book.",Alice Through the Looking Glass
